    The Law of Ueki<br />
<br />
This anime starts pretty weak. When you first walk into The Law of Ueki, there&#039;s not really anything to pull you in. It&#039;s a shounen anime. Ok, sweet, shounen I can get in the mood for shounen. So what&#039;s the main character able to do? Turn trash into trees. Awesome! wait what. He can turn trash into..... trees...<br />
<br />
That&#039;s pretty much what The Law of Ueki will hit you with. However, that&#039;s what turns this anime into something so brilliant.<br />
<br />
--Story--<br />
You&#039;ve read the synopsis so let&#039;s cut to the chase. The story in The Law of Ueki is definitely not its strongest point. As

          <span style="display: none;" id="review17499">
        far as shounens go, The Law of Ueki is ahead of its competitors. Ueki strives towards his goals one step at a time, while meeting characters who ultimately he befriends. Stick in some backstory for the characters and you have the formula that The Law of Ueki pretty much adheres to.<br />
<br />
As for the actual plot, I would give it a 8. It&#039;s interesting, because even God has a backstory in this anime. Although the story does take a bit of a dive in the middle, and never really fully recovers. Other aspects of the anime (I.E. the battles, which is what Shounen is pretty much about) more than make up for it.<br />
<br />
--Art/Animation--<br />
There&#039;s not much to comment about. Everything is done as it should be. The Law of Ueki isn&#039;t an anime that&#039;s going to wow you with its visuals. Nor is it an anime<br />
that you can&#039;t bear to watch because your eyes are bleeding. The anime doesn&#039;t cut any corners, and battles are animated to what they need to be. There&#039;s no<br />
slow-mo hi-def sword battles in this one. But that&#039;s really not something The Law of Ueki should even be judged on.<br />
<br />
--Music--<br />
The music is simply great. It&#039;s basically your daily allotment of Jpop But of course, does it contribute to the anime? I would say yes. Some<br />
of the fights and situations in the anime really get you pumped because of the added music, and that&#039;s what I believe a 8/9 under music should do for you.<br />
Clearly The Law of Ueki is no Yoko Kanno composition, but hey it gets the job done and it gets it done very well.<br />
<br />
<br />
--Characters--<br />
The strong point of the anime is right here. At first, Ueki seems kind of empty actually. However, over time Ueki begins to really become that<br />
character you root for. Sometimes his &quot;justice&quot; oversteps the line and you simply facepalm or headdesk, but thats a rare occurance.<br />
<br />
The characters are well developed, because their backstories are superb.Each character becomes unique and well defined while all contributing<br />
to the overall enjoyment of the show. Even the character I hated the most (Saru) had his good moments. Although a part of me wanted a little more<br />
&quot;interaction&quot; between Ueki and Mori, alas it was not to be. <br />
<br />
What&#039;s the best about the characters in The Law of Ueki, is that the anime also pays attention to the villains. Although they clearly aren&#039;t given<br />
as much attention as the main heroes, The Law of Ueki really nails it by giving them just the right amount of attention. It&#039;s not a 1 minute &quot;blah blah blah<br />
this is why he hates Ueki/wants to win/hates person X/wants to destroy the world&quot; nor is it an episode dedicated to a character who ends up writen off in the recap<br />
time of the net episode. <br />
<br />
--Overall--<br />
Overall The Law of Ueki is a superb shounen. The creativity behind the battles makes it a very enjoyable watch just because you think<br />
&quot;Well how is he gonna get out of this one?&quot; That question isn&#039;t simply answered by &quot;OH MY GOD HE HAS ASCENDED AND HE&#039;S KICKIN ASS!&quot; There&#039;s actually thought behind each battle, and that&#039;s what differentiates the average shounen from the great shounen.<br />

    ___________________________________________ Review the 6th<br />
<br />
Chihuahua Review(short&amp;amp;sweet): This is a good shounen(bunch of guys and action) to watch. There are alot of unique characters. Let me rephrase that there are a lot of UNIQUE powers here.<br />
<br />
------------------------------&amp;gt;In Depth Review:&amp;lt;------------------------<br />
STORY: This is not, I repeat NOT just some lame, generic kid show. The story here is a for spot to become God. Here angels become god-candidates who choose kids to give powers to and then let them battle. The main character Ueki who believes deeply in justice. This may still sound lame and generic but the story execution was great with fun interesting strategies in every battle. The only

          <span style="display: none;" id="review7047">
        real problem is parts of the story didnt make sense. 200 abilities for one person and only 100losers so far(you&#039;ll understand later). <br />
<br />
ART: Animation was well and the battles really drawn exceptionally well adding to the fights intensity. However at times the main characters look really young and it was really hard to take them seriously during dramatic moments. It does becomes unnoticeable with the addictive story.<br />
<br />
SOUND: The opening and endings were REALLY good in this one and the background music was passable. The voice acting was great here with the infamous Paku, Romi playing the main Ueki. Guess that&#039;s why I thought of Full Metal Alchemist while I was watching this.  <br />
<br />
CHARACTER: The characters here were really well made and there were alot and after watching it, I doubt there will be a character that youll end up hating. So many powers(trash into trees, towels to steel, etc.) they&#039;re so weird but u cant not like them.&amp;gt;_&amp;lt; The powers even get stronger. <br />
<br />
ENJOIMENT: I couldn&#039;t stop watching this when i started it was so addicting I always wanted to find out wat happend next. Everything blended so well! Very close to being a nine overall. Ending was nice and really hope there is a second season(heard rumors). <br />
<br />
OVERALL: No matter how generic this anime sounds it is good and definately worth a watch. Even though everything about it is not that great, the execution was amazing.<br />
<br />
Recommendation: If you like shounens with a dash of fantasy and magic watch this. If you like this then watch the Prince of Tennis or Full Metal Alchemist.^_^<br />
<br />
If you dissagreed OR agreed fully with me on anything feel free to message me and discuss it. Always fun. @_@<br />

    Following a recommendation on hunter x hunter 2011, I ended up at The law of ueki, and after watching all the 52 eps, this is what I felt : it has a cliche plot, cliche side characters, cliche mc, cliche setting of a tournament, cliche concept,.......and yet.........non cliche powers, different style of fighting, outright comedy, and  cool character roles.(i shall clear the difference between characters, and their role in character part)<br />
<br />
The story is based on a knock out tournament (a popular tag which few even classify as a genre of its own) and a final prize for the winner. This concept has been overused like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review139777">
        the chunin exam of naruto, or hunter exam of hxh, or a recent example mirai nikki. Yet the execution is entirely different and unique in its own way. The story goes on like this- there are 100 god candidates chosen, and each candidate chooses a student (a middle school student) and gives him a power, and then the students fight between themselves, and whoever wins his candidate becomes the god, and the student gains a null talent, ie any talent he wishes. Moreover if a candidates student attacks a normal citizen the student loses one of his talents, and if they loose all their talents they will vanish without a trace. That is basically the initial setting. It becomes more intense as the show goes on. The few interesting points are the powers of the candidates, like MC has ability to turn trash into trees, another guy can turn towel into iron (looks lame at first, but it is splendidly used).<br />
<br />
Animation 7/10 Sound 8/10<br />
Animation is weak, but considering it to be a 2005-2006 anime it is not some exception. It gets it job done. The characters designs are pretty good, though it had room for improvement. No kinds of scenery or stuff is present to comment upon, but animation shouldn&#039;t become a barrier to watching this splendid shounen anime.<br />
<br />
Sound was better than the animation. The opening song gave a peculiar vibe of some kind of depressing situation, but it was not much pronounced in the anime, probably due to its excess comedy. The osts were pretty good, and there doesn&#039;t exist much to complain about.<br />
<br />
Story 8/10<br />
Tournament battles are overused stuff. And the existence of a decent prize is not an exception. And obviously there exists some kind of powerful antagonist with his own perception of talents and stuff. On a broader view there isn&#039;t anything pulling us into the story, but on close examination there exists plenty of elements. First, is the MC, Ueki. He is shown to have a strong sense of justice, and much of the story evolves around the justice factor. Second, is its excess comedy, which was initially used to propel the viewer into watching more ep, and in latter eps, just as a medium to keep the story strong. Comedy is one of its strongest points, (caution : don&#039;t drink water while watching this, else water will be spilled.). Third, is MCs peculiar power trash into trees and the possibilities that arise from. Fourth, and the most important is INTELLIGENT BATTLES. This is its strongest points, it delivers incredible battles. Battles are planned, and luckily the MC can actually think on his own and uses many tricks to baffle his opponents. Once 15 or so eps, pass MC also levels up, in very very interesting ways, as such once past 10 eps, there will be little incentive left to give up this anime. The anime also delves into teacher student relationship, and values of morals.<br />
<br />
But still, the story lacks many things. First, the initial pace is slow, it is ok with manga but in anime adaptation, they could have cut quite many chapters and may be they could finish the anime sweetly in 35-40 episodes. The chapters I am referring to are not too integral in the story development, and plays very partial role in character development. In fact, the first few episodes were boring, and focused only on MC, and as result few important characters got introduced as late as ep 20. The anime should have neatly deleted unimportant battles. Even in the latter half some battles seemed to be dragged on. And only final battle remained to be seen.<br />
<br />
Characters 9/10<br />
While characters are mostly typical of shounen animes, their roles are quite varied and unique. There doesn&#039;t exist a character who is powerless at first sight but then after intensive training becomes op. The charcters develop, become better but only according to their capacities. Starting with MC he pretty much masters his powers, and his development his most pronounced. His leveling up is extraordinary, and he uses his new powers very intelligently and there are many spontaneous combos which he uses to defeat his enemies, and at times I was forced to say Brilliant! Other characters like Mori, rinko and Sano play integral role, and they too level up with unexpected variations. They receive ample development mainly because of solid back stories. The characters are carefully chosen by the author and he has intelligently played with them and the role that everyone plays is incredible. (If I were to elucidate it would be a spoiler).<br />
Interestingly, even god is a character and surprisingly has a backstory. Tbh I was quite amazed at the description of the god, and more interestingly he is a prominent source of outright comedy<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9/10<br />
I srsly enjoyed this anime, mainly because of highly intelligent battles, and some of the battles might even rival that of hxh. I was also amazed at the non cliche powers, among all I liked the antagonists power the most (can&#039;t spoil). The outright comedy was evident and there exists no episode which won&#039;t make u laugh. Added to this was powering up of the characters which added spice to the anime. Lastly and the most important part, that it has a good and actual ending, and not some lame original ending. <br />
<br />
Even then there exists many points to be criticized. First, irregular pacing, and dragged on battles. Second some cliche elements like nakama powerboost and some friendship stuff. Third, excess comedy, which at times turned into forced comedy. Fourth and the most important part is that it deals with MIDDLE SCHOOL kids. The anime had vast potentials, and with highschool students and a bit of seinen feel, packed with awesome action scenes and intelligent battles could have turned out better in many respects, because the idea of middle school kids fighting didn&#039;t really appeal to me much. Fifth, teacher student relationship was quite pronounced but again seemed to be a bit of excessive.<br />
<br />
Overall 8/10<br />
On subjective reviewing it deserves 9/10, but on close inspection and objective reviewing I can&#039;t render more than. 8/10. As such the anime should have lasted not more than 35 eps, with fast pacing and appropriate development. Had it acccomplished this feat, it might have become a showcase masterpiece and shared its stage with other good animes.

    I&#039;ve come to realize that with all the newest animes coming out recently, there are still others that people seem to have forgotten, that or they&#039;ve never heard of any of these shows. I&#039;m talking about the kind of animes that are really good and underrated, but seem to have slipped under the radar.<br />
<br />
The Law of Ueki, is one of those shows.<br />
<br />
Plot:<br />
God has created a tournament, called the battle of the supernatural powers, to decide who will take his place as the ruler of heaven. All 100 god candidates must pick a middle school student, give him/her a strange, yet unique power, and act as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19536">
        their fighter. The winning candidate will become the new god and the fighter will receive the talent of blank, which will give him/her whatever talent he/she wants. However, there are people who want the talent of blank for their own greedy and selfish desires. Enter our hero, Kousuke Ueki, who only wants to compete in the tournament to protect both his friends and the talent of blank with his power to turn trash into trees.<br />
<br />
The show is a shonen anime which means it&#039;ll have cliches, fillers, over a 100 episodes, and a plot that soon goes nowhere halfway through the show. Here&#039;s the thing though:<br />
<br />
It doesn&#039;t!<br />
<br />
The show is very unique in it&#039;s way to take whatever cliches most shonen anime seem to have, and execute them in a way that makes the show barely boring at all! It does have a rather odd and bizarre look to it all, but that&#039;s the nature of the show. Credit should go to the director, Hiroshi Watanabe, for making the show hyperactive and zany for one moment, action-packed and intense the next ( usually at the same time ), and sad and dramatic when needed.<br />
<br />
Art/animation:<br />
Studio DEEN did a good job on the show. While not lush and slick as most action shows, it&#039;s still decent and very above average. It&#039;s bright and colorful and the fights are still entertaining to watch and visually pleasing. The character designs will remind you of shows of Zash Bell, but they&#039;re not too bad.<br />
<br />
Music:<br />
All the ops and eds are nice and good to listen to. The rest of the music is decent and passable.<br />
<br />
Voice-acting:<br />
Japanese: excellent! The show has an all star cast of seiyuus (romi paku, tomoko kawakami, mamiko noto, kappei yamaguchi, jun fukuyama, souichiro hoshi, etc.) and they all did a nice job playing their roles.<br />
<br />
English: terrible, just plain bad! The voices for the characters were painful to the ears and the acting was just dreadful! There were some that were ok, but it&#039;s really not enough to save the whole dub.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Probably the strongest part of the show. All the characters are given a great amount of depth and development as well as backstory to why they wanted to fight. No matter how major or minor anyone in the show is, you&#039;ll just end up rooting for them as they struggle to be want they want to be, even the bad guys are hard to resist!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall:<br />
What I said has already been said, the law of ueki is a show that shouldn&#039;t be missed by anyone, wether a shonen fan, action fan, or anime fan in general it doesn&#039;t matter. As stated earlier, this is an anime that slipped past under the radar without anyone knowing of it and deserves the full viewing it deserves. I had a blast watching it, I&#039;m gald I watched it to begin with, and I hope others out there will to.<br />
<br />
If you liked this review, feel free to comment me, if you didn&#039;t liked it tell me and i&#039;ll understand.<br />

    Most action shows gives a group of people some of the coolest most destructive powers ever imagined. Cutting huge boulders with a sword, blowing stuff up with their mind, shooting laserbeams from their eyes, and so on. “The Law of Ueki” decided to go in a different direction. It decided to give a bunch of people some useless powers, throw them together and see what happens.  <br />
<br />
It took me about 5 minutes into the first episode to figure out this show wasn&#039;t going to have the greatest plot ever. The whole show is just a glorified tournament. The way the show explains all the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review24881">
        rules is a girl arbitrarily stumbles across some one using their power and so someone decides to just explain everything in depth to her for what really comes down to no good reason. In short the new king for the celestial world is going to be picked. Every candidate can select a middle school student from earth to fight for them and give them 1 power. Then they all fight until one wins. At least the show gives a reason why the fate of the world is in the hands of a bunch of school children.<br />
<br />
Even though it isn&#039;t a spectacular story it isn&#039;t all bad. The show did manage to throw a few plot twists in that genuinely surprised me, and I found very enjoyable. However no matter how you rap it up the show can&#039;t change the fact that the story is just an excuse to string together a bunch of fights.<br />
<br />
What could possibly be the most interesting thing about this tournament is the powers people get. There is the power to turn trash into trees, towels into iron, and electricity into sugar. The powers are kind of like “I guess I could see how that might be useful in some way possibly”, but the power aren&#039;t exactly my first pick material. There some other more practical powers like that power to turn beads into bombs or rings into rockets. Even these power aren&#039;t “I can blow stuff up with my mind” good. As odd as it might sound these powers are actually the thing that makes to show enjoyable. People end up coming up with some very creative ways of using these powers. There is also a limiting factor to powers. If someone can figure out someone else&#039;s limiting factor that will give them a great advantage. Seeing characters come up with strategies with seemingly useless powers is the best part of the show.<br />

Ueki the main character and Mori the female lead easily stand out as the strongest characters in the show. These 2 actually have some development to them and even though the clueless hero and the bossy damsel in distress has been done before I still found them fun to watch. In second is Ueki&#039;s teammates that join him along they way. They all have decent enough personalities although it maybe a little bit on the quirky side. There will be more then a few “I am going to fight for my friends” type of speeches, but  I found I ended up caring about all of them by the time the show finishes. They may not get the same treatment as Ueki and Mori, but they all get their moment in the sun. If nothing else they are good for a few laughs. Lastly there is the numerous amount of opponents. A lot are just there so that a fight can happen, but some do get a sappy back story. During the fight they will somehow see the error of their ways. Even the main enemy is fairly thin. It my not be a 5 star cast but at the end of the day they managed to made me smile.<br />
<br />
This is a show that is only going to appeal to action fans. I wouldn&#039;t consider the story or characters bad but I have a hard time seeing anyone go through 51 episodes of this show just to see how the story plays out or what happens to the characters. The fights themselves are quite interesting. I can honestly say I have never seen many of the powers in the show and will probably never see them again. Most importantly a lot of interesting uses of these powers will keep you guessing what will happen next.

    The Law of Ueki is the story of several young teenagers with super powers who are fighting in a competition to gain great power. The competition starts with one on one battles but shifts to group battles for the second round, but there&#039;s a problem. There&#039;s a competitor who wants the power to wipe out humanity. You know, this plot sounds very familiar, almost like I&#039;ve seen something with an identical story, but where was that... <br />
<br />
I remember, it was Shaman King. <br />
<br />
Be honest, you all saw that coming. The underlying plots really are almost identical. The only major differences are that Shaman King&#039;s tournament

          <span style="display: none;" id="review44923">
        had competitors of all ages and the competitors in The Law of Ueki can lose their abilities but those aren&#039;t really significant changes. Hell, even the plot twist toward the end, which I won&#039;t reveal in the interest of avoiding spoilers, is the same. To be fair, the Law of Ueki does have some legitimately funny moments, but that doesn&#039;t make up for the fact that its plot borders on plagiaristic. <br />
<br />
The characters aren&#039;t much better. They all have personalities based around common shounen anime tropes, which they play straight. The result is that they feel like very stock, listless characters. Another issue is that the main antagonist&#039;s motivations, when they&#039;re fully revealed at the end, don&#039;t match his actions. Which results a distinct impression that the writer changed his character at the last minute.<br />
<br />
The art is decent. It isn&#039;t spectacular but it&#039;s not bad either. Although they do resort to borked proportions in a few cases. <br />
<br />
The voice work is actually very well done. Oddly enough, the Law of Ueki has a lot of the same vocal talent as Shaman King. The music is mostly good. The only issue is that some of it doesn&#039;t suit the anime. Causing a disconnect between the feel of the action and the feel of the music.<br />
<br />
The yuri factor is a 2/10. Mori and Rinko have some moments that seem a little homoerotic but there really aren&#039;t many. <br />
<br />
My final rating for The Law of Ueki is a 5/10. It&#039;s average. The biggest issue it has is that it&#039;s simply too standard to stand out on its own. Everything it does with its story and characters has been done before and better. In the end it&#039;s an average shounen anime that plays it safe. If you&#039;re a fan of shounen anime, Shaman King especially, you&#039;ll probably enjoy it. Just don&#039;t expect anything new.

    This is my first time writing a review,so if I make any mistake,I&#039;m sorry.<br />
Anyway I want to make a review of this anime,because The Law of Ueki is one of my favorites anime and I want more people to watch it.<br />
<br />
Story (10/10):<br />
<br />
I know this is too much to give an anime 10 out of 10,but I love this anime!It&#039;s not the best anime around,but I know it&#039;s far from the worst.The Law of ueki got comedy,action,adventure,romance(a little).There&#039;s not a lot of anime like The Law of Ueki that has the justice Ueki has.Ueki is a boy that has a strong sense of justice that not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21020">
        many people have.He was involve into a fight where God and powers involve.Ueki have the power to change trash to tree,and then he got a lot of friends in the fight.<br />
<br />
Art (9/10):<br />
<br />
The arts was great,the quality was good and I love the fight.<br />
<br />
Sound (10/10):<br />
<br />
Yes,I know too much,but I love both the opening and the endings and the soundtrack.They were great and I almost have all the songs from this anime in my mp3.<br />
<br />
Character (9/10):<br />
<br />
I love how they make Ueki personality,I like Ueki strong sense of justice and how he always save people-bad or good-without even thinking about whats going to happen to him.I like all the characters,but other than Ueki,my favorite character is Mori.She always worried about Ueki and care about her friends.I love her powers too!<br />
<br />
I know you won&#039;t regret watching The Law of Ueki.

    The law of ueki is a very unique anime. The general story is that in order to choose the next god, the god candidates select their preferred human and grants them very strange powers. Ex, the power to turn trash into tress, the power to turn your hair into a bat, the power change a ring into a rocket....etc. The anime starts out very basic with no depth to it, although as you get deeper into the anime, the story takes some really interesting turns. It truly does get better. And please note that watching the SUBBED or DUBBED version makes a very big difference.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14174">
        Meaning that i watched the DUBBED episode till about 35 and it was really horrible, the SUBBED version made me enjoy the anime better believe it or not.If it helps any the main character is voiced by the same person that voices Hitsugaya Toushiro from bleach(japanese). The theme of this anime over emphasizes the importance of friendship and bonds, which i found to be a little irritating. The characters were ok, nothing overly special about them and the anime as a whole was pretty hilarious. The action scenes are very similar to that or gash bell although the scenes in gash bell are a whole lot better. Anyways i thought the powers in the anime, although unique, very extremely lame. However the did get a little better as you go further into the anime. So in conclusion, if you have time to spare with nothing to do and absolutely no anime to watch or your into the whole strong bonds and friendship thing or your looking for a funny anime to watch, give the law of ueki a try.

    The Law of Ueki...  I would probably say this is the first anime I watch regarding about amazing powers/abilities...  (Now even more show expand on it such as To aru Series, Book of Bantora etc)<br />
<br />
First impression...  Not good...  Thanks to the title...  I mean, who would wanna watch something with the title &quot;The Law of Ueki&quot;...  I would suggest find a better name.<br />
<br />
But after recomended by a few people, I&#039;m enter the world of Ueki.  But once I start watching...  It is absolutely AWESOME!!!  Come on...  Pretty original on the storyline...  But like all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25129">
        fighting anime, you can guess the outcome...  Hero (Ueki) meets a bad ass player...  Fight...  Loses...  Fight again with insane power... win. However, you would never even imagine the fight can turn out this way...  Plot is kinda predictable, yet unpredictable...  Contrast huh?<br />
<br />
Back to the character plotline &quot;I want to protect everybody&quot; is once again the popular tagline for this anime.  However, it kinda sux when the hero, who potentially protect everyone have the power to turn &quot;trash into trees&quot;.  Come on!!!<br />
<br />
Anyway, you will see the hero later obtain insane powers...  Because he is the sone of a &quot;Heavenly Beings&quot;...  Now that made a comeback.  Then again, it is SO UNFAIR for the other players...<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you are a shounen lover...  Like to experiance some unpredictable plot, this is the anime for you!!!  <br />
<br />

Initially I watched this show in dub and I can say it definitely hindered my enjoyment and immersion in this show. None of the voice acting was that great and the monologuing was almost unbearable. If you ever try to watch this please do it in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review381211">
        the sub.<br />
<br />
Plot: This anime is essentially one giant tournament arc, and the power system compliments it surprisingly well. The powers, as bizarre as they are, keep you entertained with the unique ways some of the characters use them. The main issue with it I had though was how they kept adding different parts to it seemingly randomly to help Ueki grow stronger. These different parts being the sacred weapons and the level 2 sort of just appear randomly with no foreshadowing or mentioning whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Characters: This category is the primary factor to why I enjoyed this anime so much. Although at the beginning there’s nothing great about the characters. Ai was just an annoying girl who screamed and Ueki was just… boring. After Ueki fought Robert in around episode 7 was where the shine of this anime first started surfacing. We got to see the first glimpse of Ueki’s sense of righteousness that he embodies. Mr. K’s influence from his righteous act of saving Ueki really hit him to allow for the start of his development and character progression. Ueki is a great main character that encapsulates the themes of the show marvelously. Righteousness is the main theme presented in this show, and Ueki perfectly embodies it. As Mr. K says, &quot;I can&#039;t tolerate people who fall below my own standard of righteousness. I&#039;ve observed a lot of people since I first came here, but none of them possess the righteousness I was seeking. I was beginning to lose interest in this realm... thinking of going back to the Celestial world. Then I met him... Ueki possesses the sense of decency that I discovered was extremely rare in this world... And his righteousness was true.&quot; In Ueki&#039;s battle with Onimon,(Ep.8) he shuns Onimon for having to rely on the talent of blank to protect his village, Onimon replies, asking what he would do with it. Ueki doesn&#039;t know and hasn&#039;t thought about it, &quot;Then why are you in these battles in the first place?&quot; Ueki says &quot;To protect the talent of blank from evil... That&#039;s what Mr. K wanted... That&#039;s our righteousness.&quot; He is only doing it out of his righteousness, because that&#039;s just what he represents. Over the course of the show his righteousness only grows with the rest of the cast. All of the main cast get a decent amount of depth and development. Even the antagonists like Robert and Hanon effectively serve their narrative and thematic purposes. Thematic being how righteousness is stronger than evil. The majority of the smaller antagonists also get smaller backstories to understand why they’re in this tournament in the first place and you can see the variation with each story and the dynamics of all the opposing teams are slightly different in their own ways. The only thing I think wasn’t used to its potential was Ueki and Mori’s dynamic. Don’t get me wrong it wasn’t bad, but it just wasn’t used to its potential. We don&#039;t really get to see either why Ai followed Ueki so much. No backstory to their friendship, nothing. I really think that Ai was the weakest in the main cast despite having the 2nd most screen time. At the end of the show they did add on it a bit by displaying the trust she had for Ueki but they could’ve definitely capitalized off of it more.<br />
<br />
Music/animation: Let’s start with the animation first. This anime was released in 2005 so you do see the black bars on the sides, but the animation wasn’t bad. You can easily see what’s going on at all times, and I never had any issues watching it at all. There wasn’t a moment where it looked clunky either it showed what it needed and that’s it. With this entire anime being a tournament arc you’d expect the fights to be dull since this anime is relatively old but it’s actually the opposite. The fights are always thrilling to watch. The climaxes of Ueki&#039;s fights are always exciting because he barely ever wins off of sheer brute force. Ueki uses his powers very smartly to win and winning by simply outsmarting the opponent adds to the thrill of the fight. It&#039;s not even just Ueki, Sano and Rinko had some great fights where they only won through smarts. Even with this anime releasing around 2005 with not the greatest graphics it still holds up today because it&#039;s still easy to tell what&#039;s going on, the unpredictability of the fights and the music is still great when it plays at the end of a fight. The soundtracks are great and always adds to the fight scenes and emotional moments.<br />
<br />
Inconsistencies: While I do love this anime, there have been a select few parts that either don’t make sense or just don’t work out. For one, the jokes. This one only applies to the start of the series because the jokes were too heavily reliant on the cringe factor of them and they weren’t funny at all. The most prominent one I’m thinking of was when Ueki was on the subway and he was just randomly dancing because he heard music and his body just couldn’t stop because he had “the power to dance.” <br />
	The second inconsistency I spotted was a bit more of a problem that ate away at me. That was when Ueki fought Robert for the 2nd time he said that his “Level 2” was being able to use multiple sacred weapons at once. But many episodes later he said that he never unlocked his level 2, and that he really needed to keep training for it. Despite that, I can’t think of any more besides just those 2.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
	This anime is character based, and doesn’t take itself too seriously, and with that I love it. The themes are executed well through multiple characters and dynamics.<br />

    The Law of Ueki is one of those anime series that I can easily relate when recommending it. Someone asks me what it&#039;s about, and first I tell them &quot;it&#039;s about a kid who can turn trash into trees&quot;, but I make sure to tell them at some point, &quot;it&#039;s like Shaman King, but with a killer environmental message!&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the first real anime I got into was Shaman King. And to find Shaman King reincarnated as this modern anime (though probably not intentionally so) really caught my attention.<br />
<br />
I mean consider the similarities. They&#039;re both about kids with powers who are trying to compete in

        this competition against other kids with powers so as to win the ability to have whatever they want to be so. Yoh wanted to be Shaman King. Ueki wants the talent of blank. Even the start of the series is the same. Ai Mori is basically the anima of Manta Oyamada, as both of them try to nose into the business of the story&#039;s protagonist and find them out and expose them for who they are. Likewise both become friends with the story&#039;s protagonist and try to help them. It&#039;s such a literal translation I can barely begin to describe. <br />
<br />
Thus whenever I recommend Law of Ueki I always call it &#039;Shaman King with a killer environmental message.&#039; Copying isn&#039;t a bad thing; if nobody ever did anything that hadn&#039;t been done before nobody would ever do anything, ever.

    I swear i will never forget about this anime.<br />
It is one of my favorite animes ever, i really enjoyed the story, it has a great comedy &amp; action. <br />
I liked basically all of the characters, especially the main one (Ueki Kosuke) I think people can learn alot from him.<br />
&amp; to mention that the story from this anime tells how important friendship is.

    Story: 8 (While can sound absurd to some people, i massively appreciate the attempt of being a completely different story for a take in shonen)<br />
<br />
Art: 6 (Granted that it is an older series, but animation consistency is still important, while some fights looks great, some looks clunky, but nothing eyebreaking)<br />
<br />
Sound: 7 (Some lackluster use of sounds, but overall nothing too distracting, the voice acting is great)<br />
<br />
Characters: 9 (Some charaters can be obnoxious sometimes, but the pay off of their characters are always very well excecuted)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7 (Some episodes are honestly a drag, but the overall watch through is quite an enjoyable ride)<br />
<br />
The Law of Ueki

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312500">
        is not for everyone, it is for those who seeks a different type of anime in regards of its execution, even with that, there&#039;s still chances people would still turn their back against this anime. but at least for me... it is a great shonen concept with ambitious premise, good characters, and great fights which relies on a very tactical rather than offensive blow trading battle<br />
<br />
Overall: 8 (An Ambitious Shonen With Good Execution)

    Law of Ueki has some good elements to it. A story in which middle school childern and granted with powers that can turn one thing into another. Our main character Ueki has the power to turn garbage into trees. Although I haven&#039;t seen many episodes of this show, it&#039;s actually pretty good. The one thing that may cause problems is that the characters talk about the talents too much. It kinda feels like it&#039;s more about the talents than whose going to be the next ruler. Other than that it&#039;s good to watch.

    Ok, this is my first review so don&#039;t expect a detailed review and also I do not look for reviews so I&#039;ve got no preference and so it&#039;s very different from a normal review by a lot of users here. I&#039;ve only heard this from a friend and said I should go check this out cause this is his favorite anime.<br />
<br />
First of all, The Law of Ueki is a very fun and exciting anime to watch even if you do not watched it while it is still progressing in Japan.<br />
<br />
Story (8/10)<br />
I think the story is simply linear. TRUE it is amazing but to me it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review122095">
        is just a simple story about a high school boy(which to me is very common and I fully understand why) who was given power to compete which have the best power. I give it a 8 because of how the story progresses. It&#039;s hard to find an anime with an excellent story progression with just a very simple story.<br />
<br />
Art (7/10)<br />
Ok, do not curse me because I give it a 7 on art because it is a not-so-old anime. I gave it that rating because the Art is good but in a story like Law of Ueki where almost all episodes are battles, the art is to be excellent. I&#039;m just disappointed when it doesn&#039;t leveling up as the story is going on but instead dropping down.<br />
<br />
Sound (7/10)<br />
The sound is OK. But again, since it&#039;s purely based on fighting there should be a LOT of background music playing(although it is not popular in that year). As for being fair into my future reviews of latest animes, I will give it a 7.<br />
<br />
Character (9/10)<br />
Almost all of the characters here is used even if it&#039;s a minor character. But in the end, they fail to keep that habit going and instead putting in a lot more appearance of the major characters. I&#039;m not saying that&#039;s bad though but because of that, i gave it 9 instead of 10.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10/10)<br />
I think enjoyment in Law of Ueki is pretty unique. Because aside from it&#039;s comedy, the battles here is what makes this fun and exciting. All battles are surprising because you don&#039;t know how will they win against another or who will win. I can&#039;t come up with any words anymore but one word is to be sure, EXCITING.<br />
<br />
Overall (8/10)<br />
Overall, Law of Ueki is a good anime to watch if you&#039;re looking for an anime in which you will not get bored of. But the rewatch value of this anime is very low since it&#039;s story progression is relying on battles and it&#039;s not that EXCITING anymore if you already know what will happen. That&#039;s why I&#039;ll give this an 8.<br />

    After finishing some rather big shounen series and looking for something new to pick up, preferably something under 70 episodes, I found The Law of Ueki. <br />
<br />
Story(7): <br />
This series is a tournament type anime, and the story is nothing unexpected. You can tell, for the most part, where it is going right off the bat. Now that&#039;s not to say it&#039;s boring, the series did have a solid story line that kept me interested, plus the series has a definite ending(wrapping up after 51E). Although I do feel your enjoyment has to do with weather you like this type of series and weather you like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review223885">
        the characters.<br />
<br />
Characters(8): <br />
One thing I love about shows like this is the variety of characters, each with their own personalities and quirks. Which is what The Law of Ueki gives. The show gives us 5(6 if you count Tenko) unique main characters, as well as a huge variety of other characters(most of which come up in fights). Each of the main characters, as well as some of the antagonists, are given some sort of backstory so you can better understand their motivations and choices(love it when shows do that). After saying all that, I personally loved all the main characters and many of the side characters as well, which is one of the reasons I enjoyed this anime.<br />
<br />
Sound(6): <br />
The voice actors of all the characters fit quite well and I didn&#039;t&#039; have a problem with any of them(that is unless I forgot about them). I&#039;m not even going to say much about the music in this anime as I don&#039;t remember anything but the opening(which I did like). <br />
<br />
Art(7) <br />
I put this here in case you were wondering about the art, however, quite frankly I wasn&#039;t really paying attention to the art/animation of this series either while watching it. Although, I do remember the fighting scenes being animated well. All I can really say is that it worked for the series and the animation was done well.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment(9): <br />
This show is exactly the type of show I was looking for and exactly the type of show that I love. I thoroughly enjoyed it right up until the end. <br />
<br />
Recommend if you are looking for: <br />
-Shounen <br />
-Shounen that actually has an end(51 episodes) <br />
-Variety of characters <br />
-Something easy to get into  <br />
-Something easy to follow <br />
-Supernatural elements <br />
-Fun characters<br />
-A tournament anime <br />
<br />
The best way to tell if this show is for you is to watch the first few episodes, once you get where the show is going decide if you want to drop.<br />
<br />

    The law of Ueki is an interesting anime that carries with it entertaining characters and Is worth checking out.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
Overall the story maintained a great balance between being fun and being serious when the time called. Perhaps not the most original in creation, it still managed to keep my attention throughout the lengthy 51 episode. <br />
7/10<br />
<br />
ART<br />
The Art was average at best. There was nothing particularly riveting in the style that managed to separate itself from the crowd but, at the same, time there was nothing to hold against it. A tad childish, I venture to describe it as ‘typically shounen’.<br />
6/10<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
The voices were well cast and the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review42113">
        sound effects and music fit in nicely with the flow. I found it easy to listen to and not stressful to my hearing, I especially entertained myself by recognizing the voices and pinning them to other similar characters they&#039;ve voice - for example, the voice actor of Hideyoshi also voices Usopp from One Piece.<br />
8/10<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: <br />
The 51 episodes flew by before I knew it and I found the ending to be satisfying. Although, the final arc itself annoyed me a little as it felt messy, rushed and a tad unfinished. Also, if you&#039;re holding out for an epic final battle between Ueki and Robert prepare to be disappointed as I was.<br />
7/10<br />
<br />
OVERALL<br />
The law of Ueki has just the right amount of twists and turns to keep you satisfied and is worth a watch if you can manage to suffer through the first few confusing introductory episodes.<br />
7/10<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />

    [This review will focus on finding out if this anime is worth a shot for YOU]<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
WHAT TO EXPECT:<br />
<br />
 Basically, The Law of Ueki is nothing like the head-first Shounens out there: the powers included in this one are rather... weird, let&#039;s say, but VERY interesting nonetheless!<br />
<br />
 What if you had the power to transform trash into trees? Or towels into iron? Well, I&#039;m not giving more examples because that would spoil it a bit, but it&#039;s pretty easy to see where this is going.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
MAIN PLOT:<br />
<br />
 The main plot is quite original! High school students get selected by Celestials (people who reside in &quot;Heaven&quot;) to represent

          <span style="display: none;" id="review212802">
        them in an all-out &quot;tournament&quot; by getting these special and hilarious powers. The one who wins gets to be the new &quot;God&quot; and the student who wins gets to choose ANY &quot;talent&quot; he wants, it could be anything, literally! Basically making a wish.<br />
<br />
 But don&#039;t get fooled! The silly plot doesn&#039;t stop this show from having fights in literally 95% of the episodes (or more!), and with many MANY different AND UNIQUE concepts / types of powers getting presented as the show progresses, the excitement on each fight just keeps getting bigger!<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
WHY IT ISN&#039;T PERFECT:<br />
<br />
 The Law of Ueki simply didn&#039;t get a 9, or even a 10 from me because it still has all those clichés as tropes from most shounen series, from the power of friendship giving you ridiculous power in the middle of a fight, or standing up even after taking a thousand hits from the strongest villain, but that CERTAINLY doesn&#039;t stop ANYONE from enjoying the CONTINUOUS thrill that The Law of Ueki provides!<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
FINAL PERSONAL VEREDICT / CHARACTERS:<br />
<br />
I&#039;d say that The Law of Ueki is probably one of the most unique Shounen series out there, and DEFINITELY worth a shot for every fight lover! The powers are not brain-dead, yet they are silly and provide some great laughs!<br />
<br />
The cast of characters isn&#039;t disappointing at all! The group of friends that is formed have all very very apparently weak and even more silly powers than other power-users in general, which makes the way the fights turn around to be very unexpected and interesting, to say the least!<br />
<br />

    This anime changed my entire outlook on life, and I live my life as I see in this anime.  The main character, Ueki, has this sense of &quot;righteousness,&quot; where he helps people and stuff like that, and will go to insane lengths.  They also throw in a few more morals to live by.  The characters are pretty cool, the story is pulls you in, the ending is mind blowing, and this anime is just too short.  Definitely an anime to check out.  This might sound super cheesy, and I am serious, but Ueki is going to be an amazing figure

          <span style="display: none;" id="review210387">
        to watch throughout all of this.  It&#039;s amazing to see characters like the ones you&#039;ll see here, and like I&#039;ve said time and time again, it&#039;s an anime to live by.
