    My life as a child growing up was a lonely one. I was socially awkward, didn’t have many friends, and preferred to stay inside reading/playing video games rather than going out. I pushed a lot of people away from me, even people that were trying to reach out to me, especially my parents.<br />
<br />
In fact, my best friend in high school wasn’t even a person: it was a kitten that I adopted from the veterinarian’s office we’d take our older cats to. Daisy was a gorgeous kitten and loyal to a fault, but there was obviously something with her different from most cats. She was very

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304475">
        slow, didn’t move around a lot, didn’t eat much, was very small, and altogether had a very sicky appearance despite being in “good health”.<br />
<br />
Daisy and I were an absolute perfect match for each other. Both of us highly valued our alone time and didn’t like being bothered by other people. However, I suspect as was in my case, she was also feeling very lonely. Our 3 other cats loved to play together, and she was mainly terrified by them, so she’d always end up hiding in my room. I also hid in my room, reading alone, holing myself in a corner and walling my heart off from the rest of the world.<br />
<br />
Daisy and I developed a close bond: she would curl up in my lap or on my desk as I would be reading or playing games, never begging me for attention, but just being there for me. Perhaps she could feel how alone I felt, how fragile and lost I was. She was the absolute perfect pet for a companion.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, midway through high school, she started having seizures. Something was obviously very wrong, the vets couldn’t figure out what it was, and she stopped eating almost altogether after only a few months after her first seizure. It was then she was diagnosed with an enlarged heart: there was nothing they could do to save her, and a few weeks later, her poor huge little heart eventually gave out for good.<br />
<br />
Personally, I’d like to believe that she was just too pure, innocent, and loving for this world that her heart was proportionally sized, and her body wasn’t able to support all of her love. At the time though, I was absolutely devastated. Losing the thing that was closer to me than anything broke me. I was actually alone and I fell apart almost entirely.<br />
<br />
What resulted from this, however, wasn’t a similar sad ending for me. From the impact Daisy had on my life, I was able to gather the courage and strength to reach out for help and rejoin the world. Because of Daisy, time unfroze for me, and I began to grow within myself exponentially.<br />
<br />
Perhaps this is why My Roommate is a Cat resonates so strongly for me. I see myself in Subaru, who as a child had a very similar experience to mine, and finally grew into a confident, strong young man because of the impact a single kitten had on the path of his life.<br />
<br />
Doukyonin wa Hiza, Tokidoki, Atama no Ue. is a story told in a unique way I have never before seen. I had always wondered what Daisy would say to me had she been able to speak, but I felt as though we had a bond that was stronger than what could be expressed in words. Through the perspective of Haru, hearing her thoughts and feelings on her relationship with Subaru, I can hypothetically affirm that the feeling I had might have been the case.<br />
<br />
At the very beginning, our protagonist Mikazuki Subaru is in a similar state to how I previously described myself, dealing with regrets and loss. Meeting Haru is the start of a journey of self-reflection and self-discovery as he begins to learn how to love himself for who he is and starts to see other people as aspects in his life. Although at first I was frustrated and annoyed with some of his actions, the way the story unfolded piecing together his past and how he ended up where he was began to warm me up to his character, enough so that I became personally invested in his development and found myself rooting for him to pick himself back up and face his fears of society and other people. The development in Subaru throughout the story is what is truly what makes My Roommate is a Cat worth watching.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, our trusty sidekick, Haru, also has a past full of regrets and loss. I never thought I’d ever get to say this, but I honestly can sympathize with a cat after all was said and done. The way Haru devotes herself to protecting Subaru, seeing herself as the strong one and him as the subordinate, plays off the usual tropes whereby pets think of themselves as the real ‘owners’, but My Roommate is a Cat really crafts this in a beautiful fashion. Haru’s unwavering dedication to protecting Subaru isn’t described as just an air of superiority but rather an undying love for him because of the care he provides for her. Ultimately, Haru isn’t just a plot device used to promote Subaru’s growth and development; she, too, has her own development and free will.<br />
<br />
Although the art and animation weren’t anything special, Zero-G did an adequate job for the type of show Doukyonin wa Hiza is. For a show where character development is at the forefront, simple animation in this case was a positive because it didn’t overshadow or distract from the main purpose of the show. Meanwhile, the OST was likewise simple but delicately crafted to highlight the emotional moments and stress the theme of hope throughout the entire show. A soundtrack is perfect for me when it touches my heart, and that is what the music here was able to do.<br />
<br />
And don’t get me started on the OP and the ED… While the music in both does an excellent job of setting the atmosphere for the show, the direction for the OP is absolutely sublime and accurately symbolizes the entire show all within a minute and thirty seconds. There are so many metaphors in the OP that I could write an entire review just on the OP itself! The beginning of the OP depicts the transition of night to day symbolizing Subaru shrouded in darkness being lit up by the entrance of Haru to his life. It is followed by the shot of Subaru alone looking down, surrounded by piles upon piles of books, symbolizing the wall between him and society, until all the books come crashing down upon him with Haru, falling from the sky onto his lap. Again, I could go on and on about how fitting the direction of the OP is for the show, but I’m sure you could see that for yourself.<br />
<br />
This anime for me is one of the most personally impactful and cathartic shows I have ever seen. It deals with themes of loss, loneliness, failure, and recovering back onto your feet in ways so realistic I can place myself directly inside the story. Every episode has emotionally resonated with me, be it happy or sad moments, causing me to tear up on each one from the strength the character’s emotions are being conveyed. If you’re coming into this expecting ‘just another slice-of-life’, you’re sorely mistaken. All of the characters in My Roommate is a Cat undergo realistic development and change for the better, highlighting the hope this world possesses even in your darkest hours.<br />
<br />
Regardless of where you are in life, regardless of how alone you feel, how depressed you are, how much you think the world may be against you, My Roommate is a Cat shows that there are people out there that care about you dearly, and there will always be hope. There is and always will be a way up - so never give up! <br />

    &#039;My Roommate is a Cat&#039; is a story about the superiority of kittens and it speaks of the truth. Why anyone would ever prefer dogs when there is a species that doesn&#039;t bark at nothing nor eat its own shit is beyond me.<br />
<br />
The series is shown from 2 different perspectives: the cat&#039;s and its owner&#039;s. The cat side is especially hilarious and wholesome because it does things that are very cat-like but also its thoughts and actions are presented as if it truly cares about its human. The human side on the other hand is an everlasting fight against the nature of cats be it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300393">
        sitting on the laptop making it impossible to do anything or scratching doors like the little assholes they can sometimes be. Also, literally cardboard boxes. Since the main dude is completely new to this cat business he manages to do lots of silly mistakes that create cute comedy moments. My favorite non-cat scene so far has been his visits to pet shop where the series&#039; very own best girl works. However, the series is nowhere near just comedic, but offers quite an interesting take on the importance of pets and how much they can offer to a person. It&#039;s especially interesting due to the mc&#039;s past and his rather fragile character who gets to learn all these new things regarding sharing your home with a cat. Real good and haatowaamingu stuff going on.<br />
<br />
Overall this show has been the biggest surprise for me from this season. Never thought Zero-G could do something I get to praise. It&#039;s ridiculously warm and accurate. Chill series to watch.  Highly recommend to those who are looking to get relaxed and laugh some. Perhaps even shed a few happy tears.

    &quot;I don&#039;t do well when people do things i didn&#039;t expect. <br />
but its after those unexpected things happen,that you find little discoveries and new encounters.<br />
So once in a while it might not be bad&quot; - Subaru <br />
<br />
There are many slice of life genre anime out there, most of them simple and sweet,for a nice enjoyable time.<br />
Then there comes those special kinds of slice of genre,which just capture your heart in the most unique way, and this season<br />
we have one, the beautiful hidden gem called My roommate is a cat.<br />
<br />
Sometimes in life, there is someone who will come along and change your life and your perspective

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304496">
        on it.<br />
But it doesn&#039;t necessarily mean, it has to be a human, a change can come in different and smallest of forms.<br />
In this case its a sweet little adorable cat named Haru.<br />
<br />
The story begins with our MC a  23 year old man named Subaru, who is a writer by profession and has recently in unfortunate<br />
circumstances has lost his parents.A sad but a soon to be what is a beautiful beginning of a beautiful story and relationship<br />
between two amazing characters<br />
<br />
After his parents death,Subaru who already was a book lover &amp; a introvert, has started to seclude himself more, alienating himself<br />
from the society and any forms of contact. Be it fate or Gods calling as one day when he is paying homage on his parents grave with some food, enters our 2nd MC<br />
a little curious looking cat lured by the food, and subaru on an unknown instinct decides to take her in. <br />
<br />
Then begins this wonderful journey between the human and his pet, which was quite interesting to see because it was something new for a story.<br />
The most amazing thing i found about this anime series it provides us Two POV&#039;s in the daily episode storyline.<br />
One from subaru&#039;s perspective and then from Haru&#039;s perspective. Which was really creative and quite a amazing view from the viewers point to be honest.<br />
<br />
Their journey begins from a basic Master and pet relationship, that is shelter and basic food provision.<br />
But slowly you see this amazing change, which mostly initated and caused by Haru. <br />
<br />
For example as Subaru, shut himself up in his house with hardly any contact, while working on his novels, hardly used to<br />
pay attention to himself,including his eating habits, he hardly ate anything for himself,but somehow made sure to feed haru and even took some efforts in it.<br />
Surprising right? but the more surprising fact was, while looking at haru Eating,he started eating his meals.<br />
And when we See Haru&#039;s POV,while she is in the house,carefully studying everything around her including subaru.<br />
She always wonders why he doesn&#039;t eat, and in her inner monologue, wants subaru to eat,as her personal belief is Food is important. <br />
This just a showcase of how simple but quite amazing the perspective of animals can be, we sometimes think what our pets or some animals<br />
We see in our daily lives might be like, what they think or why they do certain stuff, the curiosity,simple beliefs,the connection between humans and animals everything is shown in beautiful spectrum.<br />
<br />
And this one example was just one of the many beautiful plot scenes of the storyline. There are so many instances and scenes which make you go like just &quot;Wow&quot; and something near to heart which will make you smile and might bring a tear or two to your face.<br />
<br />
Not only Haru,the POV&#039;s of other animals and pets which are show in the series, also are really well presented which shows and teaches something every now and then.<br />
<br />
Another great thing about this show,they show the struggles of an introvert through our MC.<br />
It also shows that animals can actually be a form of therapy for people who are struggling in daily life <br />
Subaru who exhibits social anxiety, his life was on the verge of a gloomy standstill point until haru came in his life, he slowly starts <br />
understanding the meaning of creating bonds and relationships the people by being with her.<br />
But not only with support form haru,Subaru also display&#039;s his personal weakness, and how difficult it is to overcome it,even that you might not<br />
be able to overcome it most times, but taking the first step is winning halfway and moving on forward is the next step.<br />
That&#039;s how beautifully this concept is presented, that i cant find much words to appreciate it. <br />
<br />
Not only the animals,along with Subaru the viewers can get the notion what the anime tries to tell us.<br />
The people present in your life right now, those who care for us, support us and are there for us.We might <br />
not realize their value right now until their gone. Which was mainly shown with flashbacks of Subaru with his parents, when he realizes all those conversations and time he spent with them, how much it actually meant to him, how much he misses them and that painful feeling which remains.<br />
And now he has all these people with him who are supporting him and care for him, how he should reciprocate and regard the value of those people.<br />
All of which he slowly learns and changes himself with his daily life with Haru.<br />
<br />
That said the other side characters including the animals are really interesting to watch, as not only they help in the plot with supporting and being a part of<br />
Subaru&#039;s life,but also have good character personality and are a absolute joy to watch too. <br />
<br />
That&#039;s the reason i consider these kind of slice of life a great piece of work,not only does it show us heartwarming and light moments,<br />
but keeps giving us the harsh reality checks. A real perfect balance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Coming to animation, no complaints, infact it really quite adapts to the series.It gives out quite a calm and collected feel.I never seen Zero G&#039;s works before, but its<br />
quite going to be a upcoming studio for sure as they delivered quite well from the plot and story narration, character development and presentation. The consistency of <br />
the animation in each episode.Its quite the delight to your eyes which makes it more attractive to the viewers. Good stuff.<br />
<br />
Sound wise, great work again. I would even give it a amazing certificate, as the OST&#039;s are superb,from the heartwarming scenes to the slight dark events, the music just adapts and releases itself<br />
in perfectly.Even during important parts where the characters are having really wholesome but conversations with feelings it really helps with the background music. The OP is my favorite, it has a nice catchy tune,which is uplifting and really heartwarming,i myself cant help but shake my head along with the tunes xD<br />
The ED is a nice calming track, which is perfect for a show like this,just relaxes<br />
you more at the end of each episode.<br />
<br />
Overall i just wanna say, if i might be so bold, this show is a masterpiece in its own way.There is not a single episode, that will disappoint you.Each episode with its wholesomeness,bit of feels and sentimental values,mixed with a glaze of nice fun comedy and most importantly Haru&#039;s cute antics will just entice your heart with variety of emotions.<br />
<br />
I loved this series, and i consider it to be one of the underrated shows of the season, it deserves more attention and love from viewers and i do hope it does.<br />
If you are looking for a real piece of slice of life, with all the beautiful concepts of life presented in a delightful yet in a meaningful way, and something to relax and de-stress you, make you smile and bring a few tears with feels.<br />
then this is the show for you. Highly recommended.

    I’m not a big fan of cats although seeing these little fluffy creatures always gives me a heartwarming feeling. One of my close friends used to own a cat and I often see stray ones on the street. But just for reference, you don’t really need to be a cat person to enjoy My Roommate is a Cat.<br />
<br />
To begin, I should mention that I’m a big fan of anime that aims to chronicle storytelling between a human and animal. My Roommate is a Cat is about as straightforward as it sounds. We meet novelist Mikazuki Subaru in the beginning as an antisocial person who tends

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304498">
        to avoid people. Then, there’s the stray cat Haru who he eventually takes in. Fate has it now that these two are roommates living under the same roof.<br />
<br />
Anyone who has seen a decent amount of anime probably should at least be familiar with the usual ‘stray animal gets picked up’ plot. However, there’s not many anime that builds an entire story off of that. My Roommate is a Cat pulls the plug and does so. From the very first episodes, we take a look at the personalities of both characters – Subaru and Haru. As an adult, Subaru is antisocial and not good with people. He can be relatable to a lot of folks in society especially considering his career. He expresses his thoughts, feelings, and ideas through his novels. On the other hand, we meet Haru, the stray cat that gets adopted by Subaru. With a big appetite but a sad background story, she becomes an important part of his life. Despite being a cat, she displays human-like behavior and seems to form a somewhat understanding for them. It’s not always easy for her to understand Subaru so some of episodes results in misunderstandings between the duo. A main selling point of the show is their on-screen character chemistry. It’s incredibly appealing to see how two characters with nothing alike get along. Subaru feels a connection with Haru and even goes out to buy her food. Like most cats, Haru has a big appetite and the show makes a joke out of it with almost every chance it gets. It’s lighthearted humor that works on many occasions as we see exactly how cats behave. They are curious creatures and food means the world to them. Finally, I want to praise the way narratives is used throughout each episode. We see different points of view from both Subaru and Haru’s perspective. It’s creatively structured that gives viewers a great insight of their personalities. <br />
<br />
Besides these two characters, we are also introduced to several others that play supporting roles. Subaru’s editor, Atsushi, is known for trying to help Subaru while also getting along with Haru. Nana, the local store clerk, also has a fondness for cats and even has two of her own. Her knowledge of cats also proves to be invaluable for Subaru throughout the show. In the meantime, we also meet Subaru’s childhood friend Hiroto, Nana’s younger brother Yuugo, and even Haru’s brother, Hachi. While most of the lesser minor characters make little impact in the show, they do bring out a good amount of character chemistry between the main cast. As a slice of life story, you really shouldn’t expect a complex story. Because as I said before, the main selling point of the show is the character chemistry. The most prominent is between Subaru and Haru.<br />
<br />
Even as a show with such a lighthearted mood, there’s also sadness. Haru’s past is an example of this as she and her siblings had no parents to help them. Subaru’s parents are already dead in the show although it’s shown that they were loving parents. In one particular episode, he even recalls his past after seeing an album of his mother and realizes his mistakes. It’s also quite realistic for the fact that Subaru’s personality is also his biggest flaw. This results in him making mistakes unintentionally that sometimes involves his roommate cat, Haru. For what’s worth, both humans and animals are presented as imperfect in the show. And that’s a reality even in our real world.<br />
<br />
There’s not too much to talk about the animation’s quality except that it definitely works. Its slice of life mood has a gentle and serene-like art quality while adapting characters to a realistic degree. The most interesting element would be Haru and to my delight, she is exactly how a curious cat would be portrayed as. I should say that ‘curious’ is a key word here since she’s always wondering around the house. When food is in front of her, she would immediately pounce and jump into a fury of joy. In essence, her character expressions brings in a lot of energy to the show with her playfulness and curiosity. Not to mention, the show loves to make her energetic whenever it has an opportunity.<br />
<br />
Looking for a comfortable slice of life show with an easy pacing? My Roommate is a Cat is your answer. With a delicate cast of characters and creative story, anyone can fall in love with this show with no regrets.

    Every once in a great while, an anime comes along that alters the paradigm on what the industry should be striving for in its pursuit to garner new fans.  With a plethora of high-paced action shows, romantic comedies galore, and the machinations of psychological-based thrillers, it’s refreshing to watch an anime that focuses on what truly resonates with the audience, that being: adorable cuteness.<br />
<br />
A—Door—Rubble Que—Ta—Niss!!!  Need I say more?  Well, I’m going to anyway, so put on your favorite pair of fuzzy slippers, a nice warm blanky, and grab your favorite Totoro stuffed animal plush, because we are about to get all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300395">
        cutesy wootsy with our bad selves (hopefully that didn’t offend anyone’s comfort when I said, “with our bad selves”).<br />
<br />
My Roommate is a Cat — if you haven’t figured it out already — is flat out adorable.  In the first episode, Haru, the cat, becomes worried by her new owner’s lack of consuming necessary sustenance to ward off death.  Having seen starvation first hand, Haru decides to bring Subaru (not the car, it’s an actual person) a portion of her own food in an act of compassion; unfortunately, confused by her benevolent gesture, Subaru tossed the food in the trash, resulting in a fierce thrashing from Haru.  Now, let’s be clear, Haru clawed Forester (I’m still thinking about the car) out of love, the same way your wife throws a 25 pound lamp at you when you forget to take out the garbage.  It was a reminder that food should not be taken for granted, especially when one has experienced the horrors of food scarcity.  Impreza (Subaru) learned his lesson from this overt blunder, later devouring a handful of cat food to regain his vitality and finish the current book he was lamenting over.<br />
<br />
The next episode commenced with Haru sleeping on Legacy’s (Subaru’s) laptop, which symbolized the cutesy cherry on top of the chocolate cake that was Outback’s (Subaru’s) computer.  In the subsequent episode, they hit the viewer with a cascade of emotions, as Ascent (Subaru) reminisced about his parents before their untimely passing.  Leading to a moment where Haru, charmingly, licked BRZ’s (Subaru’s) face, in what is easily the most touching/cute moment in the series thus far.  Weaving a wonderful character dynamic between the two creatures who have difficulties understanding one another, but cling together because they have no else to rely upon.  Subaru provides a safe environment with a bounty of tasty food for Haru; whereas, Haru gives Subaru a sense of friendship and family (a missing component in his life, given his timid demeanor).<br />
<br />
Cute situations are being introduced at break-neck speed, forcing the viewer to immerse themselves with total conviction, to experience all the cute glory that each episode has to offer.  My Roommate is a Cat is a multifaceted show with a proficiency in comedy, cuteness, sentimentality, and, most importantly, cuteness!  <br />

    &quot;My Roommate is a Cat&quot; (or its longer name: check the alternative title) is this season&#039;s obligatory hidden gem. And honestly, this series really came out of nowhere and surprised the hell out of us, much more than its lesser audience on the original web manga source.<br />
<br />
To start off, the main lead: Subaru Minazuki, a 23-year-old novelist, and pretty much like Wataten&#039;s Miyako, once again we have another lead that is literally a shut-in, and is conflicted in social experiences. His speech to the outside world is through his novelist job, after his parents&#039; demise in an accident. However, this introverted life of his is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304476">
        about to take a turn with the introduction of Haru, a stray Tuxedo cat, once from a big family of 5 cats (herself and her 4 younger siblings), and split up from the harsh living conditions of the world. Their chance encounter is a blessing in disguise, as Subaru was out of ideas for his next novel, and Haru is the next step in his life and story portrayals, watching and examining Haru as he goes, and occasionally does the usual things of animal care control, such as feeding Haru and letting it roam around the empty house.<br />
<br />
On a side-note, don&#039;t be misunderstood to take this series too seriously. Due to its comedic-SoL genres, it is meant as a relieving series, one that is worth a carefree heart. By far the standout of the series is the mammal-animal POV-change in perspective, where Subaru and Haru will take turns depicting the series day-to-day issues and moments through their own eyes, and it&#039;s quite relatable for both typical humans and cats&#039; actions. Factor in the misunderstandings that leads both Subaru and Haru to go through the daily life, it actually leads to better character development for Subaru as he deals with the loss of his parents to eventually being sociable again, while Haru spends her &quot;cat has 9 lives&quot; life understanding what Subaru is going through, and occasionally gets high and worried about him, mostly on his well-being, and that&#039;s what matters much to her. So much so that it makes this series relive the E.T.-esque moments between human and cat, a truly unconvenential but dynamic relationship. And a shoutout to Haru&#039;s VA (Haruka Yamazaki, Inou-Battle&#039;s Tomoko and Monster Musume&#039;s Meroune), her voice totally fits Haru&#039;s cat character traits and personality to a degree that&#039;s fierce but heartwarming all at the same time.<br />
<br />
Side characters are there, but they only serve the purpose of irritating and surprising both Subaru and Haru along in life&#039;s course. Subaru&#039;s hardcore editor Kawase Atsushi and childhood friend Hiroto Yasaka, whom both of them really try their best to talk to Subaru and open his heart, he just wouldn&#039;t budge, and fears much of them than the outside world (in total comedic fashion). And since both of them like cats (of Kawase being a cat-lover freak), Haru would often scour at them, making for a comedic Domino Effect that lasts for that time. Nana Okami, the pet store owner, which Subaru often frequents, is a life-saver for him in helping to take care of Haru. Oh, and she has one of Haru&#039;s younger sibling as well.<br />
<br />
Art and animation is quite the fondness, something equal and a calm collective mix of both Feel and Shaft. A prolific and growing studio, Zero-G manages yet again on a promise to just let the storytelling and its characters take the course, while the art and animation is kept consistent at the level where it doesn&#039;t feel like a burn to watch this series. Moreover, sometimes I find myself going to sleep at the warm and cool backgrounds of both the art and characters fleshed out. That&#039;s how addictive this series is to the touch.<br />
<br />
Music-wise, it carries the same sentiments that this series is trying to portray to us viewers. Accompanying this anime, is the OP and ED songs that sounds heartwarming and at times, exceptional and cool. Even the background music helps out some to help the characters depict their life. Another area of greatness.<br />
<br />
The only minor complaint I have is that sometimes with the over-sentimental feelings and lack of plot, it can get boring at times, and the enjoyment wanes after awhile. While I agree that this show isn&#039;t for everyone, many will agree that this show is such a cutie-pie to watch for cuteness overload with the sweet, sweet feelings permitting out of this show. A truly recommended watch for times of refreshing.

    A wonderful anime that doesn&#039;t contain flashy fight scenes or weird fan-service. Honestly, in the overcrowding space of action, supernatural, and harem anime; something such as this stands out (at least for me).<br />
<br />
At first glance, this anime seems pretty mundane; a typical loner-style character who wants to be left alone, but can gain no peace because of the people around him. But in this case, people also includes a cat, Haru. I was skeptical about this anime when I first started, but it&#039;s definitely something I would recommend now.<br />
<br />
The pacing of the show may seem quite slow initially, but I think that&#039;s because I&#039;m (probably

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300502">
        most people too) used to the fast pace development of anime which condenses hundreds of chapters into a 13-episode anime experience. If I&#039;m not wrong, the manga is only a couple of volumes, which already makes it so that 12-episodes is already much more fitting. But back to the point, the progression is something to enjoy, the pacing makes it enjoyable to watch and nothing seems too rushed. This anime is one I can use to sit-back, relax and enjoy without getting adrenaline rushed.<br />
<br />
Another thing I absolutely love are the two sides that each episode offers. With the first half (more like 75%-ish) focused on Subaru (the main character) and his thoughts, followed by concentrating on Haru and her thought process of the same events. By doing so, questions that may arise as to why Haru is doing something in the first half of the episode gets answered in the second half. This allows us to understand everything that is going on holistically, and you may even gain new insight of why your cat does what it does if you own one!<br />
Additionally, the two sides makes it so that each episode feels complete on its own while still following an overarching story.<br />
<br />
Although, there are some things which I feel are not addressed very well. For example, I feel the side characters are not very developed besides giving us the basic exposition of something like &quot;oh they&#039;re best friends for 10 years&quot; and not saying much of who exactly the person is besides the bare minimum. Perhaps we&#039;ll see more development of other characters in future episodes?<br />
<br />
Another point I want to raise is the lack of stuff happening, which I think is something which people may overlook and misunderstand. Allow me to explain, due to the lack of real stuff happening, the whole anime seems to be pointless and directionless. Instead, I personally think the anime isn&#039;t concerned with big things happening, instead, it is more concerned with the development of the relationship between Subaru and Haru through the small things, as ultimately, it is teaching us that it isn&#039;t always the big things that define who we are and our relationships, but the small things that really make an impact.<br />
<br />
This anime also offers many themes that I haven&#039;t talked about, such as its focus on how pets can change someones life, or how one situation can be interpreted differently between people and how important it is to be empathetic. All these are valuable ideas which this anime both directly and indirectly conveys and something I&#039;m happy it does.<br />
<br />
Overall, I feel the anime has potential, but unfortunately not something for everyone. With the pacing of the show and the lack of big things happening, it can seem a bit boring. But I urge you to give it a shot, and perhaps you may come to really enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading!<br />
<br />
P.S. I am not the most knowledgeable person regarding this anime, if I misunderstood or messed something up, feel free to point it out. <br />
<br />
Note this review are my thoughts up till Ep 4.

    Please understand that I&#039;m writing this review in relation to the manga, I&#039;m looking on how well it adapted it and if it gets the feeling across naturally.<br />
<br />
First of all, Doukyounin wa Hiza, Tokidoki, Atama no Ue is a great anime and manga series. The main characters come off very well in this piece, which is most important for this story. The story is about the lives of a man and his cat from each of their perspectives, it is dependent on the individuality of it&#039;s characters. This easy-going plot leaves a lot of room to have fun with what happens in each episode, so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300507">
        the story feels almost episodic (in a good way).<br />
<br />
As for how it measures up to the manga, I&#039;d say it did well, but could have done a much better job of it. The order of events seemed rushed in my opinion, as if they were trying to hurriedly introduce all the characters in episode 1, when they should have been introduced over the first 3 episodes. This left it feeling kind of half baked, the characters of this series are wonderful and very unique people, but the anime did not introduce them well. That is my absolute biggest problem with this series, is that it did not do the characters justice.<br />
<br />
Overall, this anime is very warm and snuggly, it&#039;s the kind of anime you&#039;d watch after coming home from a late meeting at work. A very relaxing experience.

    So, this is my first review. I felt the urge to write it after seeing too many positive reviews/ratings for an anime that I think it could be considered mediocre at best. <br />
<br />
Why do I think that? When I was starting the anime I thought &quot;this is pretty standard, but Haru is pretty cute so I&#039;ll watch it&quot; but the more I watched, the more boring and repetitive it gets.<br />
I get it, it&#039;s a slice of life so there isn&#039;t supposed to be a lot of exciting things happening, but how can I enjoy an anime when all the things are subpar:<br />
<br />
- The characters are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review303760">
        paper thin, one look at the design you already know how they&#039;ll be and they never change. The MC is a big manbaby who can&#039;t do nothing. Yes, you got anxiety and all that but how does that make you unable to peel vegetables and not know nothing about cats that should be common sense, did he live under a rock ?<br />
- The art and animation is the most mediocre thing I&#039;ve seen. Cutting corners every chance they get (I know they musn&#039;t have a high budget).<br />
- The story is predictable and boring. They over-dramatize everything, it gets thrown around as a comedy routine, but it&#039;s just plain bad and not funny. <br />
<br />
To summarize, it doesn&#039;t give you the relaxed and comfy feeling slice of life often does. It&#039;s just stupid and at best makes you fall asleep.  <br />

    If you&#039;re looking for a nice light-hearted anime and you like cats, this is the anime for you!<br />
 <br />
The story is enough in-depth to enjoy but not heart-wrenching like many others. Fulfilling its purpose of a light-hearted anime.<br />
<br />
The art is a typical manga style like most animes and the voice actors don&#039;t really shine. <br />
<br />
The cat (Haru) was super adorable and cute. Her personality was nice and refreshing. The main character (Mikazuki) was (personally) relatable and nice to watch.<br />
<br />
Since I was looking for a light-hearted anime this was perfect. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an anime like this as well.

    I&#039;ll keep this simple. <br />
<br />
My Roommate is a Cat is one of the most precious shows released the Winter season. It&#039;s a hidden gem...I started this show just to see what it was like and it instantly became one of my favorites this season. <br />
<br />
The story revolves around a young man who is basically a shut in and doesn&#039;t know how to interact with the outside world well. When he was visiting his parents&#039; grave, a stray cat appears to eat the food he put on their grave site. <br />
<br />
The story goes back and forth showing the point of view of both the stray cat

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304495">
        and the main character. You find out both of their back stories, and you see both of them flourish and grow as the show continues. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know if anything I&#039;ve said gave this show any justice...but trust me, it&#039;s a masterpiece! It&#039;s a must watch! This is only the 3rd review I&#039;ve ever written and this show deserves all the love!

    I am honestly shocked this show feels as genuinely original as it does. After all, with such a simple yet loveable concept, why are there so few anime like this?<br />
<br />
Doukyonin wa Hiza—more commonly referred to by its English title of My Roommate is a Cat—is in my opinion one of the best slice of life shows in the last few seasons. The story follows the life of the shy novelist Subaru who recently lost his parents in an accident. Lonely and socially awkward, he one day randomly comes across a stray cat on the street whom he decides to take in on a whim. He&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304479">
        never raised a pet before but little does he know that it might just be the best single decision he&#039;s ever made.<br />
<br />
There are numerous things to like about My Roommate is a Cat really, but first of all I like the dynamic between Subaru and his cat Haru in the sense of just how important they are to each other given their respective pasts. Subaru has recently lost his parents as mentioned, but Haru has also had a rough life on the street with her siblings, always on the run from enemies and scavenging for food. They give each other the support and peacefulness that their lives have been missing.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the overall tone of the show is quite mature. This might partially be related to the fact that Subaru and all his other human acquaintances are adults, but just in general the writing feels quite genuine and the relationships between Subaru and his friends always come across as human. As a result there isn&#039;t really any character in this show that I find much of a reason to dislike. They all fill the roles they&#039;ve been presented quite admirably without ever coming across as tropey.<br />
<br />
Last but certainly not least however, is how the author has managed to portray Haru and her view of the world. You see, this is an anime that really has two protagonists: a large portion of the show is seen from Haru&#039;s eyes instead of Subaru&#039;s. This is generally done by first having a few scenes play out from Subaru&#039;s perspective, and then a while later you&#039;ll get to see those same events again, but this time from Haru&#039;s eyes. It&#039;s a brilliant structure that manages to provide some drastically different anglings of the same events without ever feeling repetitive—in fact they manage to fill in a lot of holes that have intentionally been left somewhat incomplete the first time around from Subaru&#039;s perspective. What I find especially impressive about this though is just how believable Haru&#039;s thought processes and actions are when you get to see things from her eyes. I can totally imagine a cat looking at the world in the simplistic and childlike way that she does and it&#039;s always a pleasure to watch.<br />
<br />
My Roommate is a Cat is an absolutely heartwarming and charming anime that feels both realistic and creative at the same time. It makes me wonder why there are so few anime about pet raising out there. Evidentially it&#039;s not a bad concept at all if executed properly. In any case if you&#039;re a slice of life fan then this should be a must-watch; even if you consider yourself to be more of a dog person than a cat person I would still recommend it as I have some total doggo fanatics amongst my friends that have still loved this show.<br />
<br />
Plus you know, Haru is cute as a button. Seeing her wiggle her tail along to the beat of the OP was the best moment of every week this season for me.

    his is a non-spoiler review. though if there&#039;s one, it wont hurt you or something bcs this anime is your typical slice of life where you just sit back, relax and enjoy the show.<br />
<br />
when i said that this anime is your typical slice of life anime, i mean it. but it has a twist in it. welp as you can see, its about a novelist who just got a cat and thats the only thing you probably need to know before watching this. the entire show is about the life of the mc which is an author with his cat. with that simple idea can

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300461">
        create such a cute show. WHEN I SAY CUTE, I MEAN IT. <br />
they even have dialogues for the cat ! so there&#039;s 2 different point of view from the mc as well as the cat. as the story progresses, it drags you in to the point where you want to know what happen next ! its overwhelming cuteness makes you really WANT a cat in your life.<br />
seriously though, watch this anime and you&#039;ll see what i mean!<br />
<br />
for rating, since i enjoy it (welp while writing this, its only been 4 episodes) i would give 10&#039;s for interesting story, beautiful art, cute characters and for the enjoyment that i got from watching this on the couch!

    Its a cute story about abandoned cat who gets adopted by a writer who lives alone, and cat who cares for her owner like a big sister. I like to say that all cats are like that but thats not true, when it comes to me specially. Because my cat never cared for anyone or anything other then food and sleep, but I still loved him a lot(my cat died few years ago, rest in piece buddy).<br />
<br />
Subaru the main character is awkward and shy, but we later learn in the anime why he is so shy and awkward and it makes sense in the long

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304473">
        run. Later in the show subaru start to develop friendships with others and he really values those relationships, it really is heartwarming to see him do that. Subaru is able to do all that thanks to his cat haru, haru shows him the care and love in way he never experienced, which changes the perceptive of subaru&#039;s thinking and the way he sees people. It really is cute to see those two bond together.<br />
<br />
The only nitpick I have with this anime is that animation itself, which is stiff sometimes and sometimes really not good to look at, then again this anime is done by a small new studio zero-G. If you look past that animation then its a moving story about a guy who learns how to value friends and relationships from a feline.

    My Roommate Is a Cat is an anime that came out of nowhere. It is a story that somehow turns the ordinary into something extraordinarily special. My Roommate Is a Cat explores the emotional relationship between a cat and a young man, something that is personally very relatable.<br />

I couldn&#039;t help but see the similarities between my own cat and Haru, and how seemingly insignificant moments between you and your cat can lead to a lasting and strong bond. This bond is something that I think can help you develop strength of character, and it was great to see Subaru and Haru both growing in character

        as they learnt from each other. <br />
<br />
As a whole, the sound design is great, the voice acting is very well done, and the music is excellent. The piano and violin score creates a sense of playfulness and warmness that compliments the story and characters and really brings all the scenes to life.<br />

My Roommate Is a Cat nails what it’s like to have a cat in your family and as your friend.

    My Roommate is a Cat is at times bittersweet and heartwarming and other times funny.  Expect to cry more than laugh though.<br />
<br />
Most of the comedy from the show comes from the titular cat&#039;s antics, and the way the show explains why cats may do those wacky things many cat owners are familiar with.  Any pet owner, especially those who have owned cats, will probably be able to identify with the depictions of pets and pet ownership in the show.  <br />
<br />
My Roommate is a Cat is told from two perspectives, that of the owner watching the cat&#039;s antics, and then again from the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304543">
        cat&#039;s perspective as we get to see what she was thinking as she performed those antics.<br />
<br />
My Roommate is a Cat is so much more than just a slice of life depiction of pet ownership.  Both the titular cat and owner have various flashbacks to their past and interactions with their family. <br />
<br />
Regret and moving past that regret are major themes of the show.  Both cat and human feel regret from their previous interactions with their family and begin showing resolve to strengthen bonds they make throughout the show.<br />
<br />
For the cat, the human provides a stable home and food, and someone she feels she needs to care for.<br />
<br />
For the human, the cat provides a living being that needs care, and something that forces him out into the world and other human relationships.<br />
<br />
The show rightly focuses on the two main characters, but several other interesting characters come into their lives, and you will be left wanting more of them and their interaction with the two main characters.

    I don&#039;t normally pick up an anime 8-9 weeks into the season, and even more so don&#039;t binge it/catch up with it, but for some reason this anime takes the crown for Winter 2019. It really comes as an underdog, and while the viewership is far less than required to take on some of the other series like Mob Psycho and Shield Hero, in my opinion it has its potential to be right up there with them as well. <br />
The show does a fantastic job of intertwining the two narratives of Mikazuki and Haru whilst at the same time dealing with the backstory drama/personal problems

          <span style="display: none;" id="review303232">
        that the two face on a daily basis. The contradicting perspectives that the two hold gives the show a plentiful amount of laughs and the way the characters change and bond over time (in their differing ways) makes this show a worth-it wait for every Thursday. <br />
While it is quite limited in terms of what the story seems to bring, it is a breath of fresh air for a new insightful way that a SOL is made and is a must watch for those who like the genre.

    WHAT AN ANIME!<br />
<br />
Easily a 10/10 anime. BUT we are just in the middle of the anime so a 9 for now.<br />
<br />
6 Episodes into the anime........just..... let me wipe my tears a little......<br />
<br />
Ok....<br />
<br />
This Anime is precious, heartwarming.<br />
From time to time an anime without Fights, without fanservice, without anything of what is the norm in the actual market, stands up and as an emissary of the heavens to show us a beautiful story about love, care and family. And what&#039;s better than that? well...that with a cat. Haru is simply beautiful.<br />
<br />
By the way....prepare to cry....... A LOT.<br />
<br />
The only bad thing is to have to wait an entire

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301635">
        week for the next episode.<br />
<br />

    If I have to be honest I would say this show is now my new favorite. My childhood has had it&#039;s up&#039;s and downs, but I did have a tuxedo cat and when I was going through one of those downs I had my cat to go to and it always made me feel a lot better. After seeing this show move my heart so much to bring me to tears at times I would say I love this will every bit of my heart cause I&#039;m sure people can relate to this a lot.<br />
<br />
To go on and say why I liked this as much

          <span style="display: none;" id="review306767">
        as I did I would have to say besides from the story I would say it was definitely the characters. Haru, the cat, was just the best and she was just so cute that I wanted to hold her whenever I felt sad. Subaru Mikazuki I would say is a good example of the growing type of character. I would say that the story did a stunning job showing his growth in the show to a point where I feel like I could do the same and so could other people.<br />
<br />
Overall, I would say that seeing these 2 act like a family (in their own way) I would say that they did a fine job doing it. I would definitely like to see more of Haru (if they ever decide to) and see their growth even more. I would high recommend this to anyway who wants a heartwarming show, and to even shed some happy tears throughout cause I sure as hell did.

    Such a beautiful show. One I almost didn&#039;t watch cause I&#039;m not a car person or much of an animal person. But I&#039;m glad I did of recommendation, thank you to those who know who they are, cause this show was amazing. I don&#039;t think there&#039;s so much negativity I could throw at it I tried. The animation being kinda iffy a good bit of the time is the only one really and even at that it&#039;s a slice of life show so it doesn&#039;t *need* to look fantastic so it wasn&#039;t a bother. <br />
<br />
The characters were all so well done and given such love

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304488">
        despite all they&#039;d might&#039;ve been through. Subaru had such a heartwarming progressing arc. Each episode saw him grow because of his connection to Haru. From a shut in who would barley even call anyone to someone willing to go across the country by himself. Undeniable progression in him. <br />
<br />
Haru as well. Her slowly coming to care for Subaru and adjust to her new life with him was great to see. As much as I love Subaru, Haru was my favorite character. Her point of view segments each episode were all so good. Each one made me laugh and enjoy her personality so, so much. The little tsun cat that could. The supporting cast was great as well. Kawase to Okami to even the other animal. All good characters. <br />
<br />
As I said the animation is the only downside but its not a major issue so I brushed it off, and sometimes it looked really pretty even honestly with some of those picturesque still shots they&#039;d use. The music is really good though. Love the opening, How it just bangs in like Haru did into Subaru&#039;s life. <br />
<br />
Overall I really loved this show. It told a beautiful story of someone discovering the big amazing world around them by being given a little push through the cat. Haru opening up his world was very touching and warmed my heart a bunch. <br />
<br />
10/10
