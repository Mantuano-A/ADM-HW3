    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
The only redeeming quality of this entire series is the OP. It&#039;s masterfully directed, has great use of music, and displays all the animation quality you&#039;re looking for in this series.<br />
<br />
Outside of the OP, the other 18 or so minutes you spend watching an episode is entirely wasted. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s no real story aside from fighting and characters can&#039;t even be called characters since they solely exist for fight scenes. I know next to nothing about any of the characters and feel no attachment or emotions towards either the demons or the idaten, likely because there is no attempt made at character development.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411490">
        <br />
<br />
I&#039;d say the most emotion-stirring scene so far was the totally uncalled for and random rape scene at the end of EP 1. I&#039;m fine with dark stuff like this being alluded to or included in media, including anime, so long as it serves a purpose. There was really no purpose for the scene to be directed as vividly the way it was. Case in point is how EP 2 highlights humanity&#039;s cruel treatment (including the aftermath of the same rape from EP 1) towards each other without going to the same lengths as the randomly included scene at the end of the previous episode.<br />
<br />
While the animation style is quite unique and the colours are vivid, I wouldn&#039;t say the fight scenes are even anything to get hype about unlike other pure action series; at least GOH had really good fight scenes. The fight scenes in Heion just feel like a Youtube demonstration of how to animate a fight scene. You know those stickman fight animations you&#039;d watch as a kid? That&#039;s basically Heion but rendered in higher quality and you&#039;re watching it while on LSD.<br />
<br />
So if you&#039;re just looking for vivid colours flashing on the screen to boost your adrenaline, you&#039;ll enjoy this series. If you&#039;re incapable of shutting off your brain for 18 minutes and just watching flashing lights, you&#039;re not going to enjoy this series. It&#039;s really as simple as that.

    This show is the reason why 3 of the most notable entities exist: Interspecies Reviewers, Miss Kobayashi&#039;s Dragon Maid, and MAPPA. What, you still cannot figure out what sets Heion Sedai no Idaten-tachi a.k.a &quot;The Idaten Deities Know Only Peace&quot; apart? Then go figure and find your own peace treaty in a wild wonderland world.<br />
<br />
Written by Amahara, illustrated by Cool-kyou Shinja (of which this is the 3rd work of 3 featured in this season, damn this author is rekting the Summer season hard) and produced by MAPPA. Announced as one of many shows at the MAPPA Stage 10th Anniversary event under debut director Seimei Kidokoro&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418757">
        direction, Idaten tells the story of humans and demons co-existing in a fictionous world where demons drive mankind nuts, only to have literate gods in the form of deities called &quot;Idatens&quot; for humans to pray for salvation and extinction upon their kind, and attain peace for an exchange. And damn is Idaten-tachi such an uncanny, other-worldly anime, if not already hinted by both Amahara and Cool-kyou Shinja&#039;s expressions of interest at weird-looking demon and deities with the same aforementioned traits from the series they&#039;ve worked on, much less all the fast-paced frenetic action. Combine that with MAPPA&#039;s production that animation-wise, looks identical to Jujutsu Kaisen and the visuals full of psychedelia, Idaten is grotesque, rapey, and in all ways condescending, but to stomach all those, and you&#039;ll see an experimentation show like no other (well, count Dorohedoro one as well).<br />
<br />
A deity, or an Idaten in this matter, is made out of these things: Adding your own thoughts to a nascent existence in order to shorten the amount of time required for manifestation. As a result, the personality of one who draws the newly chosen Idaten has a certain level of degree of influence shapen from the summoner. If you couldn&#039;t get that scientific-level explanation, just remember this trait: a common shared desire between beings thirsting for abilities that would help defend those worth living a life. That story is told through Rin, a young 800-year old Idaten who has witnessed the battle between Idatens and demons, and sealing them on a vast desert statue/monument-like location so that the peacetime &quot;treaty&quot; can be maintained for years and generations. Protecting this seal for 800 years has the Idaten gods rendered tiredness at their job, because their role is to eradicate demons, and since there&#039;re no demons to kill, they need to kill time somehow to remain for that one purposeful day, where demons have an uprising to prove their usefulness towards mankind once again. But as Magneto of X-Men once said: &quot;Peace Was Never An Option&quot;, and indeed, demons acted on that thanks to a nation known as the Zoble Empire, stacked full of demons at their disposal to wreak havoc at both mankind and the Idaten gods they pray to. So, it&#039;s the conquest of the Idatens to finally have their purpose-driven life be served to give the demons a beating-down and wash, rinse, repeat the same commitment held for those 800 years of peace past. It&#039;s quite the simple &quot;as molasses&quot; story, but Cool-kyou Shinja&#039;s illustrations truly take the manga (and now the anime) to the next level.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s of no doubt that Amahara knows what his characters want to be, and is thoroughly exemplified through the manga and anime. Starting off with the Idaten deities crew, Rin is the 800-year old Master Shifu Idaten who has crossed her life at doing the one sole, important job of not letting demons have their way, and she is OP by default, learning from the experiences of the elder gods who went before her. Her understudies are Prontea and Hayato. The former is a mix of both strength and intelligence, while the latter is this normal-looking boy who&#039;s quite brash and proud, and is one who&#039;ve suffered most with Rin&#039;s unrelenting training sparring sessions, becoming the usual &quot;no-reason&quot; Shonen-ish trope of a strong OP character to protect those who can&#039;t defend for themselves. Paula is the same as Hayato, though she&#039;s forced to become like him because she is an Idaten in name only, and walks alongside Hayato in companionship. Ysley is truly balls-to-the-wall intelligent, I&#039;d reckon that I can refer to him as their world&#039;s Albert Einstein. Alas, where there lies a yin, there must be a yang, and the demons equalize the Idatens in every regard. There is no shortage of powerful demons, but intelligent ones are far and few in-between, so for the lead group led by Dr. Oobami (better knows as Demon Lord Over-M for a disguise), the higher-up demons are posed to follow his political totalitarianism and make that ideology work. Some demons like Takeshita and Brandy (king and queen of the Zoble Empire) take that into heart, while others like the sex-crazed Miku envelopes that and comes up with strategists Zhuge Liang style to see their objective towards the end. Miku is a crazy-ass archetypal character (like the rest), and given Amahara&#039;s fascination for fictional rough sexual favours, I have to admit that Miku is the closest resemblance to Interspecies Reviewers in almost every way, and &quot;come one, cum all&quot; if we all have a lil&#039; bit of Miku in our lives.<br />
<br />
Not surprisingly, MAPPA has come under the spotlight recently for the unapologetic practices of overwork, and if the Attack on Titan&#039;s director Yuichirou Hayashi&#039;s now-infamous panda black eyes meme at the MAPPA Stage 10th Anniversary event is of no consolation, then the studio itself is in deep trouble of angering fans the wrong way. Speaking of the event, this show was one of many works featured at the event (with the biggest highlight of course all given to Chainsaw Man), and the reception was decent. Even then, I feel that MAPPA has been pushing their employees way too much by pumping out lots of works (just like all other studios except KyoAni), and while Idaten&#039;s production values are on the high-end, you can&#039;t really tell the backbones of how this anime managed to shine with its outlandishly unique visual aesthetics, hiding the inherent flaws of a studio whom has regularly pumped out hit after hit action-heavy shows like Jujutsu Kaisen.<br />
<br />
The music is just simply *chef&#039;s kiss* fantastic, and by the way, it&#039;s not Akari Nanawo&#039;s ED, but Tatsuya Kitani&#039;s OP, which is just pure banger, and one of the stand-out OPs of the season. The OP visuals are on a whole other level resembling the likes of Dorohedoro, only if it wasn&#039;t CG and a lot more color to bring that trippy, seizure feel. I&#039;d never get tired of watching such a creative OP done very well to complement the high beats of Tatsuya Kitani&#039;s excellent vocal range, and for a female-like soprano no less sung by a male. Visuals are top marks across the board, and Akari Nanawo&#039;s ED is fine I guess.<br />
<br />
Heion Sedai no Idaten-tachi is pure uncensored wildness like Interspecies Reviewers, has character designs like Miss Kobayashi&#039;s Dragon Maid (when it comes to the busty boobs part), and debut director Seimei Kidokiro&#039;s first outing is truly a great step in the right direction. Definitely looking forward to more works that this director will helm in the future, and for the rest, Idaten is not for the faint of heart with its R17+ rating of violence, profanity and sexuality at the core of it all. I&#039;m speechless that MAPPA has done another wonderful job, but that should come as of no surprise. Just get the inner workings sorted out and let everyone have some rest from working hard to give us more anime. Meanwhile, watch Idaten, it&#039;s a very good godly show that doesn&#039;t know peace in it.

    Imagine taking a great portrait like the Mona Lisa, and then furiously splashing it with buckets of different colored paint. What you get is essentially this filth of a series, and from the likes of Studio MAPPA, no less.<br />
<br />
Idaten Deities advertises itself as brainless “style over substance” entertainment, but it turns out be something far more inherently vulgar than what people wanted to acknowledge or admit. It isn’t so surprising when it turns out to be written and created by the same author who did Interspecies Reviewers, which itself was quite the shameless example of anime pornography, for better or worse. As much as I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418879">
        heavily disliked the latter being essentially anime pornography, it was at least wasn’t something I found especially offensive or grotesque. Idaten Deities, on the other hand, has a sense of embellishment that is foul and tactless in nearly every way thinkable.<br />
<br />
The basic premise of Idaten Deities sounds really neat at first. During the earlier days of human history, mysterious monsters known simply as demons attacked and came close to wiping out humanity. In response, a higher race known as deities, also referred to as the Idaten, step in and seal the demons away, effectively saving humanity in the process and maintaining peace in the world. Centuries later, humans has since advanced in technology and civilization, but have turned into their own worst enemy as a result, constantly getting into conflict with each other for multiple sociopolitical or military reasons. This is no by means anything new, but it would’ve sufficed, regardless. The long-lived deities don’t intervene, they just lay around observing stuff, their boredom fueled by the lack of adversity since the clash against the demons. The main reasoning for them to not help humans seemed compelling and mature at first: saving lives would also mean taking lives as well. I’m usually an advocate of the concept of grey morality when it’s implemented the right way. It means that the deities would eventually need to take action at some point, because the many lives that would be saved in the process of punishing and killing actual criminals would still matter more, regardless of their previous reasoning. Except that it later turns out here that the presented main antagonists turn out to be...demons themselves, revived and disguised as the radical authoritarian human figures responsible for all the main conflict. With this uninspiring and underwhelming twist, anything tactful the series had is no more. The given opportunity to judge and absolve the down-to-earth problems of humanity is discarded conveniently. The intended subtextual notes are nullified, and the show turns into your typical black-and-white action series full of conceited perilous plotting here and there that matter no more than further complications. I’m not saying a show like Idaten needs to go full-on philosophical, but what’s the point of all the chaotic splatter and action if there’s barely any sufficient groundwork done beforehand?<br />
<br />
Aside from the wasted concepts, Idaten Deities has more fundamental issues at its core. The tone is all over the place, and it seems obsessed with garnishing the obscenity, yet somehow it still wants to be something serious. Nearly every episode, the show feels obligated to insert some obnoxious, and ugly slapstick gags, yet attempts to juxtapose more serious moments. Someone gets brutally killed and turned to mush and blood, yet there’s no realistic sense of shock or impactfulness, just a stale deadpan reaction. An Idaten gets knocked around to where they have gaping holes in their bodies or broken bones all over, but then an unfunny joke or remark is inserted and immediately kills any incentive to take shit seriously. A nun is literally gang-raped on-screen to oblivion in quite visually hilarious fashion, yet she gets made fun of for being pathetic and weak. It’s commendable that the show doesn’t want to stick to the usual anime cliches, but its blatant suggestive violence and unfunny boorish humor immensely outweigh the more evocative beats this show may have had, if any at all. I&#039;ve had people telling me there&#039;s subtlety and references in the jokes made. I&#039;m not sure why we would want to know about some deep-seated meaning behind sex monsters assaulting young little boys.<br />
<br />
The pacing of the show is uneven; the narrative jumps back and forth from intense-looking action scenes to segments of tedious dialogue and contrivances. The storybuilding is uninteresting; the entire concepts regarding the Idaten and the demons as well as the history between them and humanity are delivered in literal fast-forwarded droves; they’re essentially like those extended disclaimers in a TV ad. With this inability to really establish the settings and premises in a more emphasized manner, the series is subjected to an identity crisis. I really don’t understand why this show feels the need to be simultaneously serious and funny when it can’t express any of its exalted ideologies and mechanics in a proper manner. It constantly pesters you with supposedly deep subjects while tossing all these ridiculous profane gags about rape, gory violence, sex, masturbation, and virginity. I’m not saying it’s sacrilegious to poke fun at these things if you’re watching a show that’s meant to appeal with fetishism, but Idaten Deities is too immature and unfunny to really have a good enough excuse for itself. The characters in this series are nothing memorable at all. The series continuously intends to make them look cool and quirky, but they come off as nothing more than gimmicky and annoying. There’s virtually no development implemented for them, they’re simply pulled along by the ridiculous plotline whenever it’s convenient. We get typical archetypes from the boneheaded and brash Hayato to the overly calculating Ysley to the uprighteous master figure Rin to the crazy sex-driven Miku to the evil doctor villain Oobami. Let’s not forget about that nun named Gil, who does nothing but emphasize about faith in God nonstop, but will be known more for being absolutely violated by a bunch of sexually frustrated soldiers in the very first episode.<br />
<br />
In terms of the audiovisuals, Idaten Deities does initially seem quite colorful with the artstle, but the choice of aesthetic is just off-putting. The color hues constantly change for no good reason, and the quality of the actual animation isn’t really enough to support it. There’ll be some impressive-looking cuts here and there, but the composition is a mess. Many sequences often get cluttered by annoying speedlines and awkward still frames. Many of the stylized frames are left unedited and entire scenes felt out of place and disjointed. Not surprising since this series is produced by Studio MAPPA, who are infamous for their harsh treatment of their employees and their bad habit of grabbing freelancers. Even disregarding the messiness, there’s little meaning to the drastic color changes, and the aesthetic gimmick simply comes off as completely devoid of purpose. The only time where this kinda works is with the visuals of the opening theme, which is quite impressively stylish by itself, but that is a double-edged sword, as the actual show itself simply pales in comparison. The sound design is uneven and bedridden by technical issues, as the background music plays either too loud or too soft throughout a majority of the episodes, especially during the action scenes. The OST as a whole isn’t actually that bad, but it’s not something I find memorable or impressive by any means. It’s nice to listen to by itself, but not within the show where the inconsistency in audibility gets very irritating.<br />
<br />
Much of my personal enjoyment can already be inferred from everything previously stated. I tried really hard to keep myself interested out of obligation in the hopes that I would’ve been able to think less about the plot and find amusement from the action-filled parts. That proved really hard when the show is so tonally inconsistent and the art direction. Countless times I found myself excessively annoyed by the rancid nature of the show and its fetishes and character archetypes. There was little to no engaging aspects of the show for me, whatever ideas or worldbuilding it had at the beginning were wasted for the sake of mindless fighting and fanservice. The cliffhanger ending merely served as an even more bitter aftertaste to an already stressful experience.<br />
<br />
In the end, Idaten Deities is a show whose only notable appeal is the stylish animation and not much else. Lacking a tonal identity and any commendable or interesting elements to put value in, it was a product made with no foresight or tactfulness, with everything being essentially a mishmash of different concepts that don’t mesh well at all. Even if it was fairly watchable and did some daring things, it came off more underwhelming and dull instead. I could care less about the state of its source material or whether or not it’s a bad adaptation or not, what I got was essentially a series so full of fetishes and profanity that the anime medium should avoid resorting to at all costs.

    The only other manga from this creator with an anime adaptation is Ishuzoku Reviewers, and my problem with this show is the same as my problem with that one. In both cases, you read the premise and think, “that’s genius,” but then you actually watch the show, and it’s just mediocre. The idea is that once upon a time, demons ravaged the Earth and drove humanity to the brink of extinction, so deities came down to seal them away and save humanity. Centuries later, humans have become their own worst enemy, killing each other for politics, power, religion, militarism, expansionism, the usual. However, the deities

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418755">
        don’t intervene or pass judgement, because in their eyes, the only way you could save human lives is to take other human lives. This moral detachment is a surprisingly mature worldview for an anime like this to have, and the story at first seemed like it would capitalize on this completely. The villains are this group of degenerate fascists who wage indiscriminate wars of aggression, raping and pillaging to their heart’s content. This is obviously a case where the deities should step in, because these people are inflicting untold amounts of death and destruction, so even though the deities would still ultimately be killing humans to save other humans, the amount they’d save versus the amount they’d have to kill speaks for itself. As Winston Churchill once said about the Nazis, “we can’t breathe the same air as these people.” They simply have to go. But just as the deities begin stepping in to smite the aggressors, it’s revealed to us at the end of episode two that the fascists are actually demons in disguise…do you see why this ruins the thematic message? If those responsible for instigating the conflict are demons, the embodiment of all generic evil, then the moral grey area becomes black and white, and all our analysis regarding the ethics of human conflict gets thrown out the window as humanity is completely exonerated of its greatest crimes, because it turns out demons are the ones to blame. I mean, it’s not like the evils of humanity have engulfed the world in untold amounts of death and destruction in real life before, right? It’s not like the soldiers in this show dress like Fascist Italy and act like Imperial Japan, right? Anyway, if you don’t think about it that seriously and just forget the themes, this show isn’t bad on the surface.<br />
<br />
The crazy colorful artwork looks awesome, but unfortunately, the animation is rarely there to back it up. There’s one or two flashy cuts of action sakuga every now and then, but the production is super messy, so even these cuts can sometimes be surrounded by speedlines or completely unanimated stills. It also does that annoying shit MAPPA does now where they’ll hire freelance animators without correcting their stylized drawings at all, so in the finalized episode, certain scenes will look totally different and out of place. I saw people defending this when they did it with Jujutsu Kaisen and when A-1 Pictures did it with Fate/Apocrypha and Grancrest Senki, and I won’t fault casuals for thinking it looks cool regardless of technical shit, but let’s not be willfully ignorant and pretend this is an artistic choice by the animation staff when it’s clearly a consequence of poor scheduling and outsourcing foreign animators from Twitter. Not a joke, by the way. They seriously outsourced from Twitter. The sound director doesn’t have a bad record, but the audio mixing in this show is really uneven. I bring this up because the music is amazing, but sometimes it gets drowned out by the action, and other times it’s just as loud as the dialogue. The opening is badass, and it’s filled with bizarre imagery and tons of personality, but it just makes the show seem like a let-down by comparison. The writing is fine, and the director obviously cared, but while many comedic moments can be genuinely hilarious, most of the humor is slapstick. There’s a scene where this woman makes fun of a nun for getting gang raped, so I can’t say there’s no memorable characterization, but the main protagonists are all dull and underdeveloped. It’s for this reason the series can honestly be accused of making its villains WAY more likable than its heroes. It doesn’t stick to tropes and actively tries to be as irreverent, vulgar, and objectionable as possible—to the point emotional moments feel unnatural and obnoxious—but daring doesn’t equal engaging, and the show is often boring. Some say this is a bad adaptation which butchers the flow of the manga and suffers from heavy censorship, and this may be true considering its odd pacing issues and anticlimactic cliffhanger ending, but frankly, I don’t care. What I care about is the anime in front of me, and the anime in front of me is underwhelming, if watchable.<br />

    Perhaps it&#039;s time to play Devil&#039;s Advocate.<br />
<br />
Idaten Deities is certainly an oddball among the Summer 2021 line-up. By far one of the most lavishly animated, stylistically interesting, and well-produced shows of the year has been largely ignored, and similarly written off as nothing more than incomprehensible edgy garbage that&#039;s &quot;style over substance&quot;.<br />
<br />
What a silly pain in the ass this buzzterm is. It&#039;s nothing more than an excuse for people to dismiss a well-animated work they don&#039;t like because the writing isn&#039;t trying to be the 10/10 kino that the visuals are. It&#039;s not because the writing actually gets in the way of all the spectacle

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418777">
        like the overly serious and painful melodrama in Bubblegum Crisis and Symphogear. It&#039;s because a work that&#039;s entertaining and well-presented first and foremost tends to be looked down upon. It neglects the idea that perhaps the style is the substance like in Redline. It also forsakes the idea that while the writing can’t quite compete with the visuals, it can still do enough to not only avoid getting in the way too much, but make the show more interesting in its own right, like with this series.<br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t to say Idaten Deities doesn&#039;t have issues worthy of criticizing. It most certainly does. It&#039;s crass and juvenile to a fault. The character designs by Amahara (not actually Cool-Kyou Shinja, this is based more on the OG web manga than the serialized one) may work when the female characters are just doing their thing or casually flaunting it around with their mannerisms or outfits without drawing too much attention for a (somehow) non-ecchi title. The show can even highlight that with its camera angles if it wants, since it knows how crass, sexy, and debaucherous it wants to be. However, whenever it shoves rape and sexual assault into the mix, the results are as gaudy and annoying. No matter how much the show tries to spice up the scenes with weird visuals or anything, these scenes are just needlessly unpleasant to watch. If anything, it shows why they don’t work, as the show tries to be super casual about these issues. The demons are generally vile and debaucherous enough without this element coming into play more than once to sour the mood. The fact that one character is introduced by getting raped and her second scene involves her getting fingered against her will while neither of these scenes have that much gravitas to them, makes it understandable why someone would be turned off by this show. It’s a stain on an otherwise fun and interesting ride you won’t get anywhere else.<br />
<br />
However, barring that one particular blemish, what exactly is so wrong with this show? Why is it that something like Idaten, which has higher production values than even some popular anime that have come out as of late, deserves to be buried or dismissed? The other issues people seem to have involve the show&#039;s constant color changing and its characters not being particularly sympathetic, both of which seem to miss the point entirely and feel a bit restrictive and taste-based, respectively. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s address the show&#039;s visuals. Despite being overshadowed by Maid Dragon S2 this year, Idaten is still a highlight of the year in terms of style. The colors are vibrant and the outlines are distinct, often a noticeable reddish purple as opposed to the more understated thin black outlines in most modern anime. Despite how they stick out, the characters still fit the vibrant backgrounds. The colors, both regarding the fun and expressive character designs and the art direction, are similarly vivid. The environments and colors are the closest thing anime is gonna come to looking like Cruelty Squad or ULTRAKILL, as much of a reach as those comparisons are. One can certainly take issue with the admittedly somewhat garish color choices, especially when the show completely and constantly shifts them, but it’s nonetheless really cool and fun that they did this without making the colors eye-bleedingly oversaturated. <br />
<br />
Fun really is the right word for the show’s visuals. Is it not fun for the show to constantly shake up the colors depending on the environment they travel to, what situation they’re in, or even what attacks some of the demons bust out if the situation calls for it? Should it really be constrained to only busting out these changes in the big beefy flashy moments like in Chivalry of a Failed Knight, especially when the show does this consistently to the point where it never feels aimless or haphazard? It would be one thing if it were truly random and silly, or if the colors were absolute death, but here, it’s a refreshing treat. Outside of the color changes, the actual character animation is wonderful. There are all sorts of amusing facial expressions, and the action scenes are very fluid, punchy, and easy to follow. They’re generally pretty dynamic and even the cuts that don’t seem as visually impressive and do employ some animation shorthands do, such as characters having multiple limbs to show how fast they’re punching, look way better than examples you’d find in Akame ga Kill, Slime, or any number of shows. Good luck counting the number of shorthand speed lines or stock backgrounds in place of actual backgrounds on more than one hand!<br />
<br />
Even the episode title cards have creative thought put into them, with each of them having distinct colors from one-another and sometimes being put into the environments and backgrounds! Seriously, you can feel just how much director Seimei Kidokoro and his team at (black company) MAPPA emphasized the word “fun” when it came to the visual presentation. The backlash the studio has faced regarding its abysmal treatment of its staff even by the subterranean standards of the industry is certainly warranted. It’s natural that this show would be a casualty of that in some regards, should that be one of the reasons it’s not even remotely popular for its season. However, the efforts of director Kidokoro and his team deserve to be lauded and acknowledged. The fact that they haven’t gotten anywhere near the level of attention of beloved juggernauts of modern anime visuals such Mob Psycho 100 or Dragon Maid has, hell, the fact that it’s not even close to more moderately popular titles such as Akudama Drive, is criminal!<br />
<br />
Let’s not neglect how the show is written or assume that the visuals are the only real reason to watch it. Doing so is what nets you in “style over substance” territory, and dismisses the writing purely for its juvenile aspects and [very much controlled] flippant tone. They may be the best part, but there’s more to dig into with how the show’s written than some may think. The conflict is ultimately a farcical one. The Idaten notice that demons are out there in the world after 800 years of them being sealed in the underworld, and so they find each other, train, and wipe them out. It&#039;s made as early as episode 2 that not only are demons generally weaker and aren&#039;t able to regenerate the way an idaten can, but they&#039;re never gonna have a chance. It&#039;s utterly hilarious how the death of one of their stringer members shuts them up, as they know they&#039;re the underdogs in this situation. The best they can hope for is to be brainwashed into aiding the idaten, but they already obtained all the captivates they need by episode 5. This fact and what does come in the last 5 episodes do present faint moments of hope for the demons, but the series goes out of its way to show that it&#039;s more about delaying the inevitable than anything else. They know they&#039;re screwed by episodes 2, 7, and 10. It&#039;s utterly hilarious seeing them shift the goalpost over the course of the series from &quot;killing all idaten&quot; to &quot;killing one&quot; and &quot;surviving long enough for remnants to reform in any meaningful way&quot;.<br />
<br />
Despite this, the show still manages to keep some level of intrigue with what both sides learn and guess from one-another, and how every time, most of it is true except for at least one vital piece of information that trips them up or otherwise stalls their progress. A lot of explanations and info-dumps are fast-forwarded for the sake of time and entertainment, but the way both the Idaten and the humanoid demons under Dr. Obami&#039;s rule piece together who or what he is when he himself doesn&#039;t know, is one of many examples where this cat and mouse game of information constantly keeps itself fresh while informing the audience. The more the audience learns about the idaten, the demons, and the mechanics, the more engaging some of the fights become in spite of the foregone conclusions of “demons lose and/or die”. <br />
<br />
Adding to the farcical nature is the fact that we’re not even necessarily meant to root for either side. It’s simply an entertaining charade of evil-doers trying and failing to kill and then slip past the generally callous Idaten. The show may stop and ask questions like “if the demons that forced themselves into human civilization were generally able to live and rule in secret amongst them, what’s to say they can’t coexist”, but the only one who genuinely entertains this question until the very end of the show is Gil, the one relevant human character. She&#039;s also the one that got raped in episode 1 and spends most of the shoe in captivity until being freed and watching the emperor of Zoble (the kingdom she&#039;s imprisoned in) try to make sure she and the other prisoners aren&#039;t hurt. It does seem like sometimes some of these evil demons have a shred of decency and humanity, but barely anyone cares and the most some of the others amount to is loving one specific partner or when Brandy (the Zoble demon empress) makes sure her kids are safe in a moment that surprises both her and said offspring. <br />
<br />
The idaten aren&#039;t necessarily moral, either. They&#039;re gods meant to protect humanity from demons, but couldn&#039;t give a fuck about the humans themselves or if countries slaughter each other via wars. The oldest one, Rin, even suggests eradicating the kingdom if Zoble outright, knowing any humans living there will die just to kill the couple hundred demons living there. Ysley, the most strategic one of the group, only really rejects this because neighboring countries such as Hotaena will use this as an excuse to war and it&#039;ll be a pain in the ass for him considering his master, Prontea, is stationed in Hotaena and enjoys his time there. Even Hayato and the youngest idaten for most of the series, Paula, are single-minded strength junkies and the token normal person without a strong moral compass, respectively. Morality isn&#039;t of anyone&#039;s concern except for the human, Gil, and what little standards anyone on either side has. Why care? Gil&#039;s practically chastised or brushed off by both sides for doing so regarding the war and what the demons did to her people. The show keeps this amusingly callous nature until the last few episodes where the tone still feels rather frank.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not necessarily a bad thing that we&#039;re not meant to really root for/against or sympathize with anyone. That being said, it can limit how enjoyable the show can be as the lack of ability to really care about or get invested in the conflict prevents the spectacle from being as exciting as it can be. The characters and fights are entertaining enough, and the show knows not to take itself too seriously, but it&#039;s not like the characters have that much going on beyond fun, catty banter and antics, and how Ysley, Obami, and Miku constantly scheme, learn, and adapt over the course of this conflict.<br />
<br />
Oh, that&#039;s right. We should probably touch upon some of them beyond just Gil, Paula, and Hayato. Ysley is perhaps the most interesting of the main cast, as his allegiance leans more towards Prontea than Rin, making him conduct retrievals behind everyone&#039;s backs as he starts asking most of the questions and making the most hypotheses regarding the demons. He&#039;s also the one who explains how nobody really gices a fuck about humanity aside from when demons are involved. Rin is the shrimpy oldhead of the group, existing for over 800 decades, watching her father and ancestors seal themselves for that time. Her backstory and how the end of ep 8 and start of 9 bring that back to haunt her at the end of the Zoble invasion are the closest the show comes to expecting us to care about anyone as she spent decades without anyone in the world before she realized the world had become safe for a time. The last two characters to really mention are Miku and Dr. Obami. Miku is debauchery incarnate: a supernaturally intuitive planner who spends as much time thinking as she does feeling up or hitting on prisoners and subordinates. This is before the last few episodes where things get so much more messed up and she becomes just as much of a threat as Obami. Interestingly enough, she&#039;s the only one to question him on his identity and intentions, the former of which Obami doesn&#039;t know himself, as both the idaten and audience learn only slightly more about him than he does. He just knows the initiative to conquer the idaten and the world, and that ordinary demons not quickly fused into a human brain and body are just savages that will complicate matters for both sides.<br />
<br />
The music is also pretty good, at least regarding the OST by Yoshiaki Dewa. It&#039;s not always that memorable when listening to the show itself, but there are a fair number of choir-based and intense tracks, with the vibrant and ever-shifting title track and its variants, &quot;World Adjustment&#039;&#039;, &quot;God of Battle&quot;, “Escape”, “Training Room”, “Kicking”, and “Sadness of Love” being among the most notable ones. It&#039;s like a mix of industrial and avant garde, with techno, and perhaps more indiginous (for lack of a better word) percussion and choir elements thrown in as well to make it an eclectic soundtrack. Some of the tracks are rather strange and unique, and the OST fits well with the impressive fight scenes, as well as the moments of thinking and planning several characters engage in. Many of the aforementioned pieces stood out when watching, but several more did as well upon listening to the full OST, including some of the more traditional kinds of songs in the tracklist. Meanwhile, the OP and ED aren&#039;t exactly memorable or enjoyable songs as the former is kinda whatever and the almost noise-pop-esque song for the latter is surprisingly hard to listen to, but their visuals are top-notch with a Mob Psycho 100 II level sequence and a still vibrant and fun what-if scenario, respectively.<br />
<br />
Idaten Deities is a weird and engaging show for reasons that some other titles could never get away with. It’s callous and juvenile, both hilariously and unfortunately so at times. The characters are the least interesting aspect of the series, with the amazing visuals amusingly uphill and forgone nature of the conflict being where most of the entertainment comes from. The show&#039;s callous attitude does make slapstick beatdowns more fun whenever Hayato, who expects beatings from Rin no matter what, gets demolished and treats it like an annoyance at worst. It&#039;s an entertaining spectacle with some odd decisions made towards the back end, and some interesting questions and ideas it tackles without losing sight of its fun yet lackadaisical and glib tone. There&#039;s minimal ugly CG and generally speaking, the show&#039;s visuals are consistently well-animated, vibrant, and ever-changing. If you can look past some of its worst and most distasteful moments, then this series is certainly one of the most darkly humorous and entertaining popcorn spectacles in recent years. Just beware of the cliffhanger ending that happens right when the show actively feels like creating tension.

    It has been a long tradition since anime fights are about 2 mindless guys brutally punching each other while shouting their move names out loud as if anyone even cares and eventually stops until one is deemed unable to move. What if there was an exception? What if fights only reached the climax after someone had both of their arms chopped off, eyeballs plucked out and heart pierced out? Blessed with heavenly-made animations from MAPPA, Heion Sedai no Idaten-tachi adapts the story of the peaceful generation of mythical battle deities capable of growing infinitely strong, Idatens, facing the revival of the demons. The production team

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418769">
        of Heion is a match made in heaven. With the original story coming from Amahara, the original creator of Ishuzoku Reviewers (the most &quot;cultured&quot; anime last year that is surprisingly decent) and original character design from Cool-kyou Shinja, the mastermind behind Miss Kobayashi&#039;s Dragon Maid. This show eventually became what the public claims to be &quot;the hidden gem of Summer 2021, the blandest season in a long time&quot;.<br />
<br />
Fixed colour palettes? We don&#039;t do that here, the colour changes as the atmosphere changes. You might get reminded about JoJo, which is entirely normal. The art style, as expected of another Cool-kyou Shinja work, is overly simple yet manages to remain fascinating. &quot;Never judge the book by its cover.&quot; The complexity of the art style does not define the quality and overall enjoyment of anything, anime or not. The fight animations are fluid, smooth, well-done, and perfectly demonstrates the intensity of the fight between heaven and earth, Idatens and Demons. Blood spills are everywhere, and maybe a lost limb, it superbly captures the fighting spirit that everyone longs to witness in an anime. The fight scenes are probably the first thing that comes to my mind when you ask me about what&#039;s the main appeal of Heion. Not saying that Heion is only good for its fight scenes.<br />
<br />
You might think that the character personalities are bland, but they&#039;re totally not... that much.<br />
- Hayato, the Eren Yeager of the show. Strives for power over everything else. He&#039;s not the type of character who gets overpowered simply by believing in the &quot;power of friendship&quot;, he believes in the power of power itself, constantly training under Rin in order to achieve the strongest &quot;power&quot; can become.<br />
- Ysley, the type of nerd who instead spends his time figuring out the smartest and most brilliant way to cheat in an exam. He&#039;s the big boss behind all the plans. Planning everything, performing &quot;surgery&quot; on demons to inspect and gain more knowledge about them and even managing to convince enemies into joining forces with him.<br />
- Rin, the only surviving Idaten from 800 years ago, rumoured to be the strongest Idaten out there. Nothing much to talk about her except that she&#039;s basically the center of the story. She&#039;s the trainer of all Idatens and everything relates to her. Even Obama himsel- I mean Oonbami has some sort of relation to her that might be spoilers if further elaborated.<br />
If you look closely the characters are actually not that bad.<br />
<br />
Openings. Some skip them. Some don&#039;t. But in Heion, NO ONE on Earth skips them unless they&#039;re in a rush. The OP is an absolute banger. It&#039;s a combination of a catchy song and animation that perfectly matches the beats and bass of the music. Providing one of the best OP experiences ever presented in the entire anime history.<br />
<br />
The quality of sound effects are not realistic, low-quality, and drags me back to the 80s when television and the animation industry weren&#039;t as fully-fledged as the present. However as the show progresses, I realized that IT WORKS. Take as an example when a studio hired a chef to film a cooking show on making pancakes, but the production team messed up and provided the ingredients for a pasta. The chef still managed to make pancakes better than before knowing that it was the wrong ingredients. I know this might not make sense but it&#039;s the most direct way of explaining how well the seemingly out of place sound effects work in this. It fits the atmosphere, the plot, the simplistic art style, to the point that you will feel weird if you imagined Heion with realistic or any other genres of sound effects.<br />
<br />
So the conclusion, is Heion worth our time to watch? Yeah, probably. Possibly the only con of the anime is that there are a few bits of deus ex machinas. If you&#039;re looking for some otherworldly fight scenes and a simple yet dark and thrilling story then I highly recommend you to give this a shot. It&#039;s fully up to you whether you decide to mark this show as a boon or a bane.<br />
<br />
Heion Sedai no Idaten-tachi gets an 8/10 from me.

    Average intellect characters in this anime would be giga geniuses in other anime.<br />
So much happens per episode.<br />
It&#039;s so fast paced dynamic and colorful.<br />
Characters act rationally and play to their strengths fully.<br />
Plot is consistent and things established early on are used even in later episodes<br />
Exposition dumps are done at 10x speed<br />
<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t usually rate shows because I am not a pretentious anime viewer that gives 1 to shows because they are to sensitive about controversial topics in FICTION.<br />
<br />
Especially when those controversial things happen for a reason and establish the atmosphere of the world the characters live in. Also this controversial thing that happens in episode 1

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416571">
        will function as a plot device later on, therefore it functions as a cog in the story and its not just shot value.<br />
<br />
THIS. THIS SHOW IS A MASTERPIECE!<br />

Keep in mind that this review will be updated as the series continues. Since this is my very first preliminary review, I will try to express my utmost honest opinions directed towards this anime adaptation. The story did not really grasp much of my attention considering that I have only seen two episodes, but seeing others hyping the series through two measly episodes, I could not resist the urge to have to disagree with their statements. As expected of MAPPA Studios, the art was magnificent and quite unique; however, I am not going to include the art and animations as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411528">
        the main factors to my overall score, for obviously fair reasons. We are introduced to 4 main characters: a nerdy guy, who seems to have the most intellect out of the 4 casts; a kind, peaceful girl; a sensei who takes things sincerely and perceives discipline as a great contribution to self-growth; and the bit dense, vigorous boy who tries to overcome any complications with his fists. Overall, I am not particularly that invested into the characters yet, including the main antagonists, the demons. Most of you might not be comfortable regarding this topic(pls don&#039;t cancel me twitter(;-;)), but I thought that I would address it in my review. What did I think about the rape scene? I thought nothing of it.<br />
&quot;Oh, but that scene was significant in validating and illustrating the true despicable evil residing within the hearts of humans.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
If I am being truthful here, it feels like forcing myself to feel aroused from one plain sentence. For example: &quot;The door is red and the walls are green.&quot; Many of you will not concur with this comparison.(cough cough totally not replying to vanilla-only viewers getting disgusted every time they see you-know-what tags). Am I a heartless human being who advocates such vile acts? Obviously not and I sincerely hope that none of you will even come to that sort of conclusion. Please understand that all I am trying to convey is that this specific scene, in my opinion, is not something that deserves to make an anime even more hype than it really is. Yes, I know that the purpose of that scene was to remind the viewers of how sinisterly dark the series is and will only continue to get worse from there, which makes it more interesting for at least some of you cultured people, but it simply did not register the same effect on me. Putting the bit controversial scene aside, my enjoyment did not meet much of my expectations, but I do highly recommend watching the series. Who knows, maybe the author of Ishuzoku Reviewers will actually pull it off. It is highly unlikely, but I have hope, I guess. Ultimately, as of currently, the characters just seem too cliche and uninteresting. Thus, the only reason I see fit for people wanting to popularize this is the art, animations, brutality, sadism, and lines of philosophy mentioned. To clarify, they are hooked on the dark plot and the splendid art &amp; animations. Excluding MAPPA&#039;s magnificent talents, the genre did not pique my interest at all. If the consistency continues, I might force myself to continue reading Martial Peaks again, featuring Yang Kai as the main character. Please do not search it up, I do not want anyone to overhype that long series as well. xD To elaborate once again, this is just my impression of the first two episodes. If there is visible improvement to the show, that will be fantastic and astonishing. Being able to witness its potential increase throughout the episodes will indeed fulfill my satisfaction. Do note that I gave a score of 7/10 to express my assumption that the series definitely has the chance to flourish and be able to shine its dazzling gems.(Cringey, but I am sure my English teacher will be happy.(;~;)). Ultimately, if the series is able to redeem itself despite its cliches, then that would be fantastic. However, if there is no relevant improvement displayed, I am going to have to bump it down to 5 or 6/10 if I am being honest here.<br />
<br />
P.S. When I rate an anime an 8/10, that itself is already an exceptional achievement. I tend to treat each number as one giant leap. For instance, you can compare my rating system to Osu!&#039; stars difficulty system. I hope you guys understand this explanation lol.<br />
<br />
I am a 15-yr old noobie weeb. My vocabulary is lacking, I know. My memory is horrid and I am inexperienced in terms of writing and anime, but I still wanted to share my thoughts to you all. :D

    Meet the action of Dragon Ball, the comedy of Gintama and the Drama of Cowboy Bebop and mix them all into one. <br />
You get an anime full of action scenes and something that is unique yet still familiar. You&#039;ll fall in love with the characters, you have a whole assortment, from the typical Shonen main hero we all know to the deceiving guile mastermind. <br />
<br />
The story might seem simple, but that actually what makes you fall in love with the anime.<br />
<br />
I see a second coming of Dragon Ball but with a mix of Gintama and Bebop.<br />
<br />
The character building is occurring at a steady pace and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411576">
        the potential future developments are endless.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
-Simple yet Deep story that doesn&#039;t pull punches with the gore, sex and the R+ like one piece or Naruto.<br />
-Crazy action<br />
-Comedy showing that the anime doesn&#039;t take itself too seriously<br />
-Intriguing characters <br />
-The ART style<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
-Sometimes the comedy part breaks the feel of the epic fights and setting the word the anime is set in.<br />
-Not very realistic and there are a few shortcuts in the logic, this however, is like many other anime where we choose to ignore these discrepancies to simply enjoy the anime.<br />

    For me this is an anime that I thought was going to be shit but he and that anime that we broke our faces and we liked very quickly because he and that anime of being fights way with incredible funny moments full of reference so much from other anime series movies, series also about how the world is today I also liked how it is portrayed and also has an animation that is very different and very beautiful, the opening is very good and so even though it has this fast pace I don&#039;t see any problem despite it have some scenes of Echhi

    There are no spoilers in this review. Also, I rarely rate something 10/10.<br />
<br />
This show is fantastic. It starts slowly, and, to be honest, initially I thought that it would be just another overpowered esper battle show, 7/10. Now, the show is approaching to its end, and I totally assure you that that initial impression was wrong.<br />
If this anime were a book, it would be a nice modern sci-fi rather than a light novel. It makes you think: wow, that&#039;s a really interesting and well-thought world. In this aspect, it resembles me Shinsekai Yori, though the story, art style and overall tone are all different

    Why Heion Sedai no Idaten-tachi is one of the most iconic anime of last decade?<br />
<br />
In short, it includes: <br />
- JJK&#039;s like fast-paced action;<br />
- Soul Eater&#039;s / Devilman: Crybaby&#039;s like aesthetically pleasant artstyle;<br />
- battles of wits (not Death Note level, still can give a headstart to JoJo);<br />
- hidden between the lines philosophical concepts (for example, coexistence of different races, war questions, science dillemas);<br />
- dirty topics, which are needed not just as a fan service, but also complement story and setting;<br />
- catchy characters: each with their own peculiarities;<br />
- great ost, which only is opening worth.<br />
<br />
Overall anime rating 10/10<br />
Further goes more detailed review for sophisticated readers.<br />
<br />
Story 10/10<br />
Idatens, demons,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418685">
        people - everyone with their own interests interacts with each other. Some lives for science knowledge, some tries to reach new heights, some follows the teachings of their ancestors, some only satisfy their animal needs, others just exists. <br />
Military theme raises up even in times of peace. This is what happens in Heion Sedai no Idaten-tachi. To avoid spoilers, I will not go into the details of the plot. However Heion Sedai no Idaten-tachi is one of the few pieces of art, in which events do not happen on their own, and the storyline moves based on the actions of the characters, which fit logically and do not contradict everything that we have learned earlier.<br />
<br />
Art 10/10<br />
Artstyle of the anime may not be for everyone, however, in my opinion, it suits the setting well.<br />
<br />
Sound 9/10<br />
Opening song became one of my favourite. Other soundtrack splendidly accompanies all the anime doings.<br />
<br />
Character 10/10<br />
Every Idaten has unique character, which makes them truly memorable. I can&#039;t say the same about minor characters, but there are also many bright personalities among them (for instance, Miku and Piscalat). As I said everyone has their goal and methods to achieve it.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
For the current moment i can be charmed with all the Idaten&#039;s vibe, nevertheless the anime is remarkably entertaining.

    **SPOILERS**<br />
<br />
The art and characters of this show come across as sort of whimsical and humorous. It contradicts the story as it told along with the brutality that is depicted throughout. There is a lot of pointless and completely random scenes of fluorescent shapes and colors that pop in and out. If its trying to be stylish, it&#039;s failing. It looks like FLCL, Kill la Kill and Dragonball had a baby. Your mileage may vary on this show but one thing I cannot stomach is the romanticized, joyfully colored rape scene at the end of episode one. It is absolutely appalling. I&#039;ve seen the Revenge of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review413476">
        Healer series and while the subject matter is the same, Healer does not try to hide its darkness. Heion, however, presents the scene in a playful almost comedic manner complete with a waltz soundtrack and dancing montage. I will not finish this one. Garbage.

    &quot;In a nutshell ... I think it&#039;s an anime you watch when you feel like throwing away your annoying ethics.&quot; - Amahara 6:27<br />
<br />
The target audience for this anime is for those that are tolerant against typical dark themes like r*pe, gore, etc. If you can&#039;t handle these themes then it&#039;s not intended for you. As for those who are tolerant, if in anycase that you find the execution poor, then you have all the right to argue and criticize.<br />
<br />
Now without further ado, let&#039;s get into the analysis.<br />
<br />
<br />
Plot:<br />
<br />
A seemingly simplistic plot about Gods Vs. Demons, but underneath all that we have ourselves a very intricate set

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418926">
        of characterization and themes.<br />
<br />
Sub-Genres: Ecchi, Mystery, World-building, Morality<br />
<br />
World-building is a common element that Amahara likes to add to his collection of works, such as the case with Ishuzoku Reviewers. While this may be a basic element, it still plays an important role in establishing the state of the world which greatly parallels with world history. While the world-building isn&#039;t revolutionary, it still sets up some pretty absurd moral actions that each species tend to appeal to. To simplify it, the moral takes granted most of the time tend to shit on human logic which may come off as unappealing to moralistic individuals.<br />
<br />
The morality throughout this whole series is abysmal, which is to be expected when the main cast is comprised of Gods and Demons. Of course a human is added to the mix to give their take, but we all know how that turned out. To be honest, the whole morality ordeal is pretty unbelievably realistic. For example, the current generation of Idaten living in isolation and peace for most of their lifetime don&#039;t ever find the need to develop a sociolgical structure like humans do. As for humans, they are weak and need to rely on support for each other. That is why they form sociological structures, but since humans are weak they will eventually fall into the act of commiting sin. And due to the act of sin, conflict arises, which ends up with humans being predatory towards one another. Of course the Idaten will pay no heed towards this, because it is not their problem and even though the majority of their being is made from human thoughts, they know for a fact that the predatory acts will just support the growth of the predator&#039;s side which doesn&#039;t have any affect on humanity&#039;s decline. As for the Demons, they are pretty much oppressive dictators who have absolute power over the humans. There are two types of demons, [Intellectual] and [Base]. The [Base] demon is basically a rampant monster that possesses little to no intelligent thought and they run on the basic instinct to attack the Idaten. The [Intelligent] demon is basically a mixture of human and demon, where if successful, you would have yourself a very powerful creature that is capable of basic human intellect. But if unsuccessful, you would have yourself a weak demon who is inflicted with a major side effect. These side effects are still successful tbh, considering the abilities we&#039;ve seen. To conclude the morality of demons, they basically function just like humans, since they possess their brain afterall.<br />
<br />
Mystery is also another common theme to be found, but I won&#039;t get too deep into it like with what I did in the previous paragraph. The mystery incorporated is done through huge exposition dumps that definitely feels like lazy story-telling, but considering the pacing of the story it&#039;s understandable. While it&#039;s definitely a subjective opinion, I believe the directing towards these fast-forward exposition dumps was handled pretty well. A bombtastic ost combined with moving visuals is an effective strategy in engaging the viewer into boring dialogue. Besides that point, the mystery narrative comes up pretty often as well as being solved pretty often. This doesn&#039;t come of as pretty impacting, but it for hell sure does keep the viewer engage.<br />
<br />
Ecchi is the last thing I will cover for this section and I will make this short.<br />
<br />
Any artists seeing this rn better get on their ass and create some rule34.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
I definitely felt like a lot of details went into their species rather than their actual &quot;character&quot;, but I would still like to cover this part.<br />
<br />
To sum it all up, each character is pretty stereotypical, but I don&#039;t mean to put this in a negative tone. Although they follow the basic personality format, they are still pretty enjoyable characters thanks to Amahara&#039;s sense of humor. Of course a lot of these jokes may be filled with a lot of dark humor, I still found it quite enjoyable since it gives a bit of meaning towards each of their character.<br />
<br />
If you want to know the basic traits for the Idaten:<br />
<br />
Hayato: Shounen MC that wants to become stronger<br />
<br />
Isli/Yeesly/Easely: Nerd that serves as exposition dumps and strategy tactics<br />
<br />
Paula: ... Fill-in Heroine? (I honestly think she has a ton of potential with her communicative ability, but so far she served little to no purpose other than negotiations)<br />
<br />
Rin: Training Master that is brutal af. Also one of the two idaten who served an emotional purpose.<br />
<br />
Prontea: He seems pretty cool and laid-back, but he&#039;s built like a mf ronald mcdonald head ass.<br />
<br />
The last Idaten is actually a spoiler, but I would just like to say that this one has the most potential out of all them in terms of character development.<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t be going into the demon&#039;s side, but from watching the series I can say that they do possess the traits of humans as well as being bat shit crazy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Animation/Visuals/Production (AVP):<br />
<br />
This will be the last thing that I will cover in this review so I want to make this long.<br />
<br />
As expected of Fuko Noda (Producer of Dorohedoro), we now have ourselves another masterpiece in terms of the art/visuals. The mix of different color palletes can be seen throughout this series and it&#039;s used in such a creative way that I can&#039;t help but find myself looking at it in awe and admiration. It is without a doubt one of the most artistically creative works ever seen in the anime medium and to think that this is being paired with Amahara&#039;s cartoonist and simplistic artwork is pretty unbelievable. Also to top it off, the Idaten Opening is a certified masterpiece, nuff said.<br />
<br />
*(Yes, I know that Coolkyoushinja is listed as the character designer, but none of the character designs actually look like his work. Take a look at the Islis from both source materials for example.)<br />
<br />
For the animation side of things, I would definitely have to say that it feels kinda experimental. This is to be expected since many of the freelancers that worked on this series are just starting to make their debuts. While it may be experimental, I still think the animation in this series was pretty above average and there were definitely some very good moments, but they ended too short which kinda sucks. I believe the reason for all of this is the fact that the production wasn&#039;t so great in the first place. Considering they announced the pv last year back in november 2020 and for it to release within the 2021 summer time-frame, the schedule is handled pretty poorly. But considering the staff&#039;s talent, I would like to praise them for putting up with this mediocre schedule and to still produce high quality content at the same time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion/Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
As with that being said I&#039;ll be giving this an ９/10 for this review. I know that I barely listed any criticism for this review so I&#039;ll list a few such as the plot barely having any substance. Viewers will percieve the substance to be psuedo, considering that it was mostly given to us through expostion which isn&#039;t good story-telling wise. Another criticism that can be made is about the flimsy structure of the plot. The plot being as basic as it is doesn&#039;t exactly strike that much to some viewers and it isn&#039;t exactly outstanding, so concern is to be expected.<br />
<br />
Moving on from the criticism, I honestly think this is one of the best animes to come out this year. The directing was insanely good and it still managed to give me the feels even if most of the main cast are sort of apathetic towards humanity. The ost as well is another masterpiece in my books which is all thanks to Yoshiaki Dewa (Flying Witch, Fate/Stay Night). This series felt so chaotic and simplistic in such a fun way that I can&#039;t help but f&#039;ing love it.<br />
<br />

    This series hit the ground running, immediately hooking me in with it’s unique psychedelic art, starting off with a chaotic first episode that serves as an excellent introduction for what the rest of the series will be.<br />
<br />
Episode 1 starts off with your standard “demons once walked the earth hundreds of years ago but were sealed away” and the series sets up to be possibly the most standard shonen one could create. This alone could possibly be enough to turn away many first time watchers… if it weren’t for this immediately being followed by the masterpiece of an OP.<br />
<br />
The groundwork of the OP is an absolutely

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418844">
        bumpin’ track that immediately went on my workout playlist from the second I heard it, laying down the foundation that the rest of the opening would be built on. We start with a slow avengers style fade-in to the title card, followed by an immediate jump into strobing colours and shifting fractals, all centred around the various characters of the show. I can’t stress enough how incredible this opening is. There is not a single person I have shown it to that didn’t immediately love it, with intriguing visuals mixed with such an incredible song. If you have yet to watch it, take a quick 2 minute break and go check it out, because you’re in for the long haul with this review.<br />
<br />
After the OP we cut to a shonen style master and student training session with two of the main protagonists, Rin (the master) and Hayato (the student). For the first few seconds it seems like your standard power trip shonen training until Hayato insults Rin, to which she responds by beating him to a bloody pulp. This is the first instance of this show breaking the expectation of the viewer. After his training is complete, he meets up with his idaten friends Ysley and Paula. <br />
These protagonists are presented as your standard shonen tropes of the master who is immensely powerful and constantly spouting stories of old, the student who is focused solely on training, the smart friend who is incredibly intelligent and hates training, and the female who is more gentle and talks to animals.<br />
<br />
Shortly after meeting up they have their first confrontation with the obvious antagonist, the Zoble nation, a militarized nation focused on conquering and gaining more power through war. They fight their first demon who was found trapped in ice, and once again we find ourselves on the standard shonen track. During the course of this first battle we see Hayato “kill” the leader of the Zoble empire only to find out that it was an automated robot, and we start to see a more devious side of Ysley focused on gathering data on his enemies and running experiments. The first episode concludes with a graphic rape scene during a successful invasion from the Zoble empire with a contrasting orchestral soundtrack playing in the background, which completely shatters any and all expectation that this may just end up being a shonen despite any earlier deviations from this script. Truly this episode is a masterclass in how to hook an audience, feeding into their expectations just enough to make them question whether this show will follow the script of its predecessors, only to shatter that belief to pieces with the final scene.<br />
<br />
What I have discussed thus far is only what hooked me into Heion, not what made me love it. What made me fall in love with this show was the attention to detail in what seems like the most trivial parts of the show. In episode 7, we see Paula and Ysley interact with the religious state of Sarabael, and everything about this scene is perfect. Suddenly the show shifts from the subject matter of the plot being fight scenes and scheming to a serious introduction of religion and politics. Political undertones and bureaucracy remain as background elements throughout many of the following episodes, and they are portrayed with surprising accuracy. <br />
<br />
On a similar tangent, the intelligence of Ysley and Miku were clearly well thought out, with their conclusions actually arising from logical deduction instead of just this magical and ethereal thing that we are supposed to believe is intelligence (see BBC’s Sherlock Holmes or any other of a wide variety of “intelligent” characters throughout pop culture). <br />
<br />
This attention to detail is carried throughout the entirety of the series with many more instances such as Rin’s inability to change her methods as new ones are developed being an excellent parallel to older generations, and many of the major plot points cropping up in the final episodes referencing elements brought up in prior episodes. <br />
<br />
I’m sure this statement will make a lot of people mad, and I’m sure many will write off my entire review simply because of it, but I feel it needs to be said. The only other series that I have seen this level of attention to detail in is Attack on Titan seasons 1 through 3, and it is that - not the cool fight scenes or edgy humour - which makes this show a 10 for me.<br />
<br />
In closing, I’m sure many who watch it won’t find the same enjoyment that I did, but why miss out, when you just might find yourself having the same experience I did? I truly would recommend this show to anyone who isn’t scared to get into a potentially more graphic show than they are used to.<br />

    I&#039;m not entirely sure where this show is gonna go, or how it&#039;s gonna go there, or even what&#039;s going on half the time, but three eps in it&#039;s got some cool themes and fight scenes already.<br />
The art and the actual content don&#039;t really match at first, but after a little bit the contrast honestly makes it more enjoyable, but I gotta say,<br />
This is one of the weirdest and most chaotic fever dreams I&#039;ve had in a while.<br />

    At first i didn&#039;t quite like it i found it a bit meh, but now holy sht i fking love it. The story is really interessting, it&#039;s very unpredictable which i really like. When i try to predict what&#039;s gonna happen something completely different from what i had expected happens (it doesn&#039;t always happen tho like with the demon lord sht, but when it does it&#039;s amazing).<br />
The art works really well with this anime and the sound/music is fking great especially the opening.<br />
The characters are amazing the way they act, how they do thing all have a reason for it. Every one of the characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417634">
        differs from the other they all have a distinct personality.<br />
I would rate idaten deities 9,5/10. This is an amazing anime it&#039;s really worth your time watching it. You might not enjoy it at first but give it a chance.

    *** TW for episodes 1 &amp; 5: these episodes depict egregious scenes of SA *** <br />
<br />
I remember when this anime initially aired and a lot of the reviews for this were talking about how dark this anime was from episode 1 and oOoOooH iT&#039;s sOoOO gOoD. I&#039;ll be frank, if you think SA is necessary for a story to be dark or is an indicator of a GOOD dark story then I highly recommend you go read some statistics of SA and its effects on victims because you absolutely cannot boil SA down to just being a TV trope. It still occurs today and a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review413885">
        real sign of maturity is not in whether or not a person can handle watching something as traumatizing as SA, but whether or not someone can admit that SA is an ongoing issue and how it&#039;s presented in media can be immensely damaging. Frankly, I&#039;ve seen way too much of that kind of dogsh*t to tolerate it anymore. This is a seinen show, so if you are a minor, don&#039;t interact with the show,,, seriously.<br />
<br />
Story: 6/10<br />
In episode 2 alone, the show is already playing with some very interesting concepts such as where the Idaten come from as well as the demons in Zoble. Overall, the story seems interesting enough and the story beats are working towards what seems like an interesting adventure for the characters we know, as well as whatever Ysley is up to. However, it all just kind of reeks of stuff that I&#039;ve already seen before, only the premise of a handful of immensely strong gods who&#039;ve little to no battle experience now coming into conflict for the first time in 800 years is pretty much the most intriguing thing about this. On the other hand, the evil empire doing bad stuff for whatever reason (I honestly couldn&#039;t tell you what) is just... eh.<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
I don&#039;t think you need me to explain this. It&#039;s extremely colourful and the animation is solid. It carries a simple yet striking theme in its character design and the background is coherent with everything going on around it. But, as a side note, don&#039;t forget that animation is an extremely hard industry to work in so send the animators your appreciation, but not the studios who exploit them.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
OP is a banger, soundtrack and sound effects work great, and voice acting is stellar.<br />
<br />
Character: 6/10<br />
So far, the characters aren&#039;t anything original. You have your standard hard-headed shonen protagonist, the smart guy, the pure animal-loving ingenue, and a ton of other archetypal characters. Rin is probably the most interesting character because, at first, she&#039;s the archetypical teacher who acts motherly sometimes yet also doesn&#039;t take anyone&#039;s crap lying down and is extremely straight forward which all makes for some great interactions with the other characters. Furthermore, it&#039;s interesting to see her as essentially a child 800 years ago compared to now but I don&#039;t see her getting much development in the future. The only characters who really show any sort of promise are Ysely and Prontea but, after episode 5, I just feel as though I&#039;ve seen these characters before and done better. Only Rin and Piscalat are the most intriguing characters in my opinion, while everyone else seems very mediocre nor fleshed out outside of their cookie-cutter archetypes. I especially am not very ecstatic by the show&#039;s repeated s*xualisation of its female cast (excluding Rin) but more on that later.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3/10<br />
And here&#039;s where I need to get real (a big trigger warning for SA). At the end of episode 1, there is a r*pe scene where a nun is assaulted by soldiers while praying to God. While I&#039;m not religious, this may be both triggering for those who are and victims of SA. The scene is integrated into the end of the episode with little correlation to the scenes prior, puts in a bit of fanservice when the soldiers rip off the nun&#039;s clothes, overlays what would&#039;ve been a potentially interesting montage of the assault with waltz music - though clearly the music is intended to dark irony as what is going on is clearly not romantic at all, I would personally have kept it silent out of respect - which then cuts as the nun prays to God, and then proceeds to the shows ending theme of cute girls doing cute things to cute music. Needless to say, it left a rancid taste in my mouth, and honestly pretty upset with it. Now most scenes like this should arguably leave you with this sort of reaction as this stuff is immensely horrible but it shouldn&#039;t impair your enjoyment of the show. Yet here we are. Up until this point, the panty shots and Gainaxing were becoming an eyesore but it didn&#039;t hurt me. This scene did and rightfully so, these scenes should be as horrible to watch as they should be experienced first hand and you can&#039;t go undercutting the trauma of the victim like this. It&#039;s straight-up disrespectful to victims and the viewer, especially when everything else was going so well. From the looks of things - in episode 2, there are references to r*pe of people of all ages and gender which is pretty nasty tbh; as well as some gross sexualisation of Paula in episode 4; and then both Ysley somehow rips off Piscalat&#039;s top off and administers a debilitating aphrodisiac (which, I guess, she&#039;s a demon... but it&#039;s still horrible to watch) AND the nun from episode 1 is assaulted AGAIN in episode 5 - this kind of stuff isn&#039;t ending anytime soon. So take this as a warning, while the rest of the show is pretty enjoyable, there is certain content within the show that is insensitive and triggering. If you&#039;re looking at a show with a r*pe scene and thinking &quot;nice, dark fantasy&quot; then please take a moment to consider how traumatizing this stuff is and remember that SA and hyper-s*xualization - they literally s*xualize a r*pe victim in the opening - is still a massive issue in our reality. It&#039;s not a matter of maturity, but of experience.<br />
<br />
Overall: 5/10<br />
I&#039;ve given myself time to think it over and watched some more episodes, and my concluding thoughts are just that there are other better shows that do this exact thing much better and are far easier to stomach. Depending on how the show continues to tackle issues of war and its crimes, the show has a lot of potential but it may completely undercut it by handling such issues very poorly. If you are not easily triggered and are going into this show with a good understanding of everything I wrote about above then you should be well-equipped. Personally, I will be dropping this show just because it just doesn&#039;t spark joy (quite the opposite really) and I only have so much free time that I don&#039;t want it to be spent on things that can potentially make me sick to my stomach. Look, if you enjoy this stuff then more power to you but don&#039;t go making others feel bad for it, there&#039;s some pretty distressing stuff in this show so it&#039;s pretty justifiable honestly. That&#039;s it from me, please have a safe viewing experience!

    after seeing the first and second episode , i really like how theyve made humans look the worst out of Idatens and demons, they included a r*pe scene at the end of the first episode which in my opinion was very important because it showed that man kind is the worst of them all. i<br />
<br />
the characters are also a good we have a sensei, the MC who seeks power and has the potential too be the strongest Idaten , a nerdy guy who prefers to study rather than fight, a very young idaten who enjoys talking to birds more than fighting, she also is like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411933">
        a ninja and is very silent , then we have the demons who we dont know much about we just know there&#039;s a demon lord, 3 other demons and a very very very horny demon.<br />
<br />
id also like too mention the art, its very rare that we get art like this its very unique and it changes colour palet every so often , the animation is very good as expected from a stuido like MAPPA<br />
<br />
OVR 9/10<br />
id give the story a 8/10<br />
i personally love the art so id give it a 10/10<br />
i didn&#039;t really gather anything from the sound so ill give it a 5/10<br />
i like the characters so a 8/10<br />
i very much enjoyed the first 4 episodes so ill give enjoyment 8/10

    I didn&#039;t know that there was such a good anime among the new animes. When I looked at the anime&#039;s drawings and cover photo, I said that it would be a garbage series. However, after watching a few episodes, I realized that I was wrong. It is an anime that everyone should watch, whether they are new to anime or have started in the past. <br />
<br />
Even though the story of the anime was simple, it worked wonders as art. The fights are not that good, but they reflect the atmosphere well. Mappa studio has done a successful job again. Even though half of the anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review413919">
        is over, he connected me to him. Moreover, if we talk about the characters, the main characters were not bad. While I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a masterpiece, it definitely has an aura to watch. Finally, the opening of the anime was great. I never expected such an opening.<br />
