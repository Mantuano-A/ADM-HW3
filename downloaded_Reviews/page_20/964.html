    Growing up is not an easy process, and there are always moments that one looks back upon with a sense of embarrassment and regret. One might ask what it is that truly marks the transition into adulthood: the ability to live independently, or maybe the conformity and adherence to social norms. Are the people who remain true to their childhood interests not grown up, then? Perhaps. But is there anything wrong with that? It&#039;s hard to say. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s a strange term used in Japanese internet culture. &quot;Chuunibyou&quot;, or more literally &quot;Eighth-Grade Syndrome&quot;, refers to matured individuals with an absurd self-created persona. Remember the times as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review81666">
        a child when there was a TV character you found appealing and you pretended to possess their superhuman abilities in real-life? A chuunibyou is a teenage or adult form of that, but to such an extent that the fictional persona defines their entire lifestyle. Certainly, behaving this way in public would make for some embarrassment, and recovering from such a past even more so. <br />
<br />
Poor Yuuta. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s an experience that he knows all too well. After suffering from chuunibyou throughout middle school as the &quot;Dark Flame Master&quot;, he makes the decision to move on from the past and attempt to live his highschool years as a normal student. To ensure victory and start anew, Yuuta applies to a high school where none of his middle school classmates are attending. It may have been a successful plan, too, if not for the unusual appearance of a beautiful girl on his balcony. <br />
<br />
Her name is Takanashi Rikka, a current chuunibyou, representing everything that Yuuta used to be and desired to forget. Worse, she recently moved into the same apartment complex and overheard Yuuta&#039;s last days as the Dark Flame Master, ensuring that it is not a past he will escape so easily. He unwillingly gained Rikka&#039;s interest in him as a result, and his attempts to make a pleasant first impression at his new high school are interrupted by Rikka&#039;s chuunibyou provocations. The fact that Yuuta wants to forget and start anew is irrelevant, because for her their relationship is a destiny revealed through her &quot;Wicked Eye&quot;. Perhaps she wasn&#039;t entirely false, either, occult terminology aside. <br />
<br />
Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai, shortened to Chuu2-Byo, is a title that stands out for the interaction between these two characters. It&#039;s nostalgic (and often times embarrassing!) to see the characters act in silly ways reminiscent of childhood, though without the endearing cast of characters this would probably seem like little more than a neat gimmick. Yuuta and Rikka are what make the anime, and their interaction is nothing short of adorable and hilarious. Both of them have substance and play off of each other in creative ways, such as Yuuta using his abandoned Dark Flame Master persona in order to cheer Rikka up when she&#039;s feeling depressed, or her playing around in awe with his old gear. It&#039;s definitely cute, and cuteness is something that Chuu2-Byo has no shortage of. <br />
<br />
An important addition to the character dynamic are the side characters who each fulfill their own role in the series. Sanae Dekomori, ace middle school student and proud chuunibyou, behaves as servant to Rikka and her Wicked Eye, possessing a weapon of considerable danger in the real world: her excessively long pigtails. Kumin, a senior with a fondness for napping, and Isshiki, Yuuta&#039;s jealous male friend and classmate, also highlight the cast. The most important of these characters, however, is Nibutani Shinka. Despite initially being the only character in the anime truly definable as &#039;normal&#039;, she is actually an ex-Chuunibyou herself, much like Yuuta. When her dreaded past is discovered by Yuuta, she throws away any notion of kindness in order to keep him from spilling the truth. As Rikka develops her own feelings for Yuuta, though, Nibutani begins to display a much more compassionate and benevolent side to her personality, even going as far as to use her old persona to help them progress. <br />
<br />
Appearances often mislead, and Chuu2-Byo is exemplary of this. What seems to be a cute slice of life revolving around the chuunibyou lifestyle is actually structured as a love story. Comedy is predominate during the first six episodes, but hints of Rikka&#039;s feelings for Yuuta are consistently displayed as the series progresses. Love is an emotion that she is not familiar with, and amidst the confusion there is often an overlap between her sensitive side and her chuunibyou side, often using this persona to hide her embarrassment. It&#039;s very endearing to watch her feelings develop as she realizes that these are emotions not of respect, but genuine love. The romance is exceptionally subtle, while consequently there is no overbearing drama used to advance their relationship.<br />
<br />
At least for the first half.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s often a problem with drama in anime, especially since it tends to hit the viewer with all the subtlety of a speeding subway. Titles like Toradora and AnoHana are a couple examples of drama on overdrive, and occasionally Chuu2-Byo can feel a bit like those titles in the last six episodes. Is there anything inherently wrong with excessive drama in an anime? Certainly not. After all, it depends on the execution itself and other aspects such as the characterization and dialogue. But what when the drama comes from nowhere, undermining the appeal of the series and turning it into something else entirely? This is where problems occur in Chuu2-Byo. What starts out as a lighthearted comedy with subtle romance becomes an exhaustive high school drama in the second half, and it really hurts the series as a result.<br />
<br />
Why change it, then? It&#039;s a question that I might never find the answer to. It&#039;s not as though the anime was lacking in substance before that point, or that it needed to make a sudden switch to develop the characters and their relationship. Yuuta and Rikka were steadily progressing, and there were still the occasional dramatic moments that felt natural to the show. While there isn&#039;t so much an issue with the execution of the second half (exaggerated crying and yelling aside), it is a problem when the anime feels like two entirely different shows in one. It might have been less of an issue if aspects of the first half still subsisted, but the comedy is unfortunately tossed aside in favor of drama. Which is disappointing, as the lighthearted character interaction is what made the first half of the anime so special. <br />
<br />
There are also some other minor complaints if one were to nitpick, such as Kumin being a pointless character and adding nothing besides a few cute scenes of her sleeping, or the contrivances of some of the dramatic situations (receiving a letter written years ago at the most convenient time — really?), but on the whole it doesn&#039;t do much to detract from what is an otherwise well-written and heartwarming experience. <br />
<br />
On a more positive note, the lavish production values customary of KyoAni do a solid job of enhancing the emotional value of each scene. Character designs are appropriately cute while the animation has an extraordinary level of polish and finesse, particularly during the faux action sequences often illustrated whenever Rikka has a confrontation with another character. More commendable, though, is the storyboarding of some scenes. There are a few moments in the anime that are truly breathtaking, such as Yuuta and Rikka quietly sitting together under a bridge and watching the lights of society shine and flicker along the river. <br />
<br />
A fundamental piece to any good love story is the presence of an emotional soundtrack, and Chuu2-Byo does not disappoint with its music. Fitting tracks are used for both the lighthearted and dramatic moments, and there is a particular piano piece that will manage to pull your heartstrings a bit whenever it is used. The opening and ending sequences are also quirky and memorable, and these songs will most likely be glued to your head for quite a while afterwards. With that said, it&#039;s always a little amusing during the second half of the series when the upbeat ending song plays immediately after a dramatic scene. It really represents the disparity of the two halves. <br />
<br />
Chuu2-Byo is certainly not a miraculous or flawless anime by any means, but it is easily above the vast majority of anime out there (the romance genre especially). Perhaps the drama won&#039;t upset you nearly as much as it did with me, or it could possibly enhance the experience for you, even if changing the entire tone of an anime midway through will no doubt cause some concern. <br />
<br />
But if I&#039;m to be rewarded with a genuinely heartwarming story, six episodes of unadulterated fun, and one of the best romantic pairings in the past few years— is it worth a little bit of frustration? Probably.

    I like to laugh. Who doesn&#039;t? I like to smile. A smile always brightens the day. I like to watch some high school kids pretending who they are not and cosplaying as characters like the Dark Flame Master. Oh, I guess this is the right place then because Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! can do all three of those things. Killing three birds with one stone, awesome isn&#039;t it?<br />
<br />
Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! (Regardless of My Adolescent Delusions of Grandeur, I Want a Date!) is an anime series based on the novel of the same name that is produced by Kyoto Animation. Some fans of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review77049">
        Kyoto Ani (Clannad, Hyouka, Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu) will definitely rejoice because the Japanese studio is already well known for its rich visuals and aesthetics. They have been involved with many series with the typical high school life being turned from normal to abnormal and they did it once again!<br />
<br />
The series takes place at a typical high school setting. It involves a young boy named Yuuta Togashi who is suffering a case of...chuunibyou, or “Middle School 2nd Year Syndrome&quot;. In technical terms, it is a condition in which an individual deludes themselves as being a smartass and looks down on others. They also believe they have some sort of “special power” that excludes themselves from the normal society. It&#039;s actually quite common though. I don&#039;t know if you ever felt this way but a lot of people do weird things in high school. I mean, it&#039;s like how you used to believe yourself as a superhero like Batman or Superman when you were younger. Good days, good days.<br />
<br />
And of course, high school has it all: drama, comedy, romance, delusions, cosplaying, and all that other good stuff. So without further ado, let&#039;s introduce the two main characters:<br />
<br />
Rikka Takanashi – forget that eyepatch. This girl has that syndrome I&#039;m talking about. She visions herself with the “wicked eye”. (which sadly is just some colored contacts) Unlike Yuuta however, she still has the chuunibyou. She is the girl who gets the most abuse but also the one that brings out the most laughter with her absurd yet comedic stances throughout the series. Take for example..that random scene when she bounces around like crazy during the pilot episode or those Lelouch-like poses.<br />
<br />
Yuuta &quot;Dark Flame Master&quot; Togashi – he USED to have the chuunibyou syndrome. But now, it seems that his past is haunting him once again when he meets Rikka. He used to believe himself to be..the Dark Flame Master. I&#039;m trying to envision myself exactly what is the Dark Flame Master. Does it have flames? Is it a master of the underworld? Or is just some villian who can emit cool flames. At any rate, his high school years becomes abnormal after meeting Rikka.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s not too much of a story to be honest yet. The series is more about comedy and the events that surrounds the main characters. They live their high school days like normal teens although the majority are anything but normal. For example, Sanae and Rinka has this Tiger and Dragon rivalry. They fight in absurd ways that is beyond normal by the way they delude themselves. Yes you got it, they also have the chuunibyou as well, or at least used to. Later on though, the series takes some more emotional turns with a few insights into the past, especially those into our main female protagonist, Rikka-chan.<br />
<br />
The artwork of the series is glorious like most of Kyoto Animation&#039;s other works. Its background settings of rich visuals are there and reflected upon every delusion, every action, every laughter, every  chuunibyou-like behavior. Kazumi Ikeda who is involved with the character designs of the series brings out the M in moe from the characters like Rikka, Yumeha Togashi (Yuuta&#039;s cute little sister), and Kumin Tsuyuri.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is also quite lighthearted that reflects upon the comedic mood of settings and characters. When there are battle scenes though, it swiftly changes to a more fast paced rythym to make it looks like it&#039;s real despite the fact that it&#039;s just a delusion. Now as for the OP song..wow, just wow. &quot;Sparkling Daydream&quot; by ZAQ sure got their point through. The opening song of the series induces eye seizures. Every time I watch it (even upon now occasionally), the scenes flashes back into your head and makes your eyeballs follow them endlessly. Of which, the OP song is also catchy with the silly pose of Rikka-chan. The stance of  “(σ O ω・)σ←↖↑↗→↘↓↙←↖↑↗→↘↓↙←↖↑↗→↘↓↙←↖↑↗→↘↓↙← “ is ridiculously catchy and there have been many parodies on the net to mimic it. On the other hand, the ED song &quot;INSIDE IDENTITY&quot; by Black Raison d&#039;être seems ordinary with a nice melody.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is a very entertaining series to watch. It&#039;s not like the usual harem with a pathetic protagonist who can&#039;t make up his damn mind. But rather, it involves a kid who tried to escape from his past but ends up living it now with his new friends at high school. Entertainment is not so easy to bring these days especially with a lot of already used ideas but this one here is executed pretty well in my opinion. So, give it a shot.<br />

    First review. I just finished this so it&#039;s fresh on my mind and I absolutely must write about it.<br />
<br />
STORY: 9<br />
What we have here is a typical story executed in a wonderfully original way. KyoAni blends the comedic and dramatic into a nostalgic exploration of adolescence topped with their particular charm. I found myself laughing, cringing, and tearing up multiple times throughout. It&#039;s an emotional roller-coaster, yet I feel it manages to avoid the realm of melodrama by contrasting drama with gags. It does what Toradora failed to do for me. That said, I feel the show could have used one or two more episodes to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review95073">
        ease into the drama. The shift comes fairly quick, but really, it wasn&#039;t much issue. <br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s a nice balance. Juxtaposing comedy and drama--blending reality and fantasy--serves as an astute parallel to the theme of escapism and develops a touching story about growing up and the ambivalence toward leaving our younger selves behind.<br />
<br />
<br />
ART: 9<br />
Beautiful. The animation is absolutely fantastic. Action scenes are dynamic and larger-than-life. More relaxed scenes are nuanced and fluid. Character designs are seriously cute (even the guys). Atmosphere is used very well to complement scenes, whether it be a tender moment under a bridge or a restless heart trying to fall asleep. The only thing that knocks off a point is the occasional usage of fairly awkward-looking 3DCG. On top of a detailed background, it sticks out like a sore thumb. <br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s stunning. <br />
<br />
<br />
SOUND: 8<br />
This is really just a matter of taste. I liked the opening much more than the ending. BGM was sweet and melancholic and complements scenes well. During romantic scenes, there are insert-songs which I thought were a little unnecessary.<br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 9<br />
KyoAni has turned up the moe to 11 with Chuunibyou, and even the &quot;anti-moe&quot; Nibutani has her own appeal. That aside, every character&#039;s motivations are believable. Their interactions are dynamic and the source of both silly comedy and powerful drama. It&#039;s also nice to see an MC who isn&#039;t completely clueless when it comes to romance. That said, he still isn&#039;t an expert.<br />
<br />
Overall, there&#039;s a fair amount of depth to these characters, and for the ones without it they&#039;re nice to look at. I found myself getting sucked into these character&#039;s lives and relationships. Despite how exaggerated some of these characters actually are, they feel very real.<br />
<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 10<br />
This is an amazing piece of work. It looks phenomenal. It reminds me of Haruhi (primarily Disappearance), FLCL, Kare Kano, and maybe a bit of Haibane Renmei (atmosphere, pacing, climax). It hits like Makoto Shinkai.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s something sweet and familiar, but gripping, touching, and anxious at the same time. Watching this series is like a trip into the past--one that&#039;s exciting and glorified and fantastic, distorted by time, but one that feels real nonetheless. It&#039;s nostalgia.<br />
<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 10<br />
More like a strong 9, but I&#039;m going to round up. It&#039;s been quite a while since I&#039;ve seen a series capture so many emotions so vivaciously and with such force. It builds from a very relatable theme and fully fledges into a compelling and imaginative comedy/drama about growing up. Coming-of-age stories are incredibly common, but Chuunibyou manages to establish a difficult balance between the tongue-in-cheek and the deeply sincere. The result is a piece that is as honest, real, and moving as it is funny. This is without a doubt one of the best things KyoAni has put out.

    EDIT (1/1/13) : In the past, in advance and now I must express my greatest apology for creating spoilers of this series. I completely forgot somehow even though on my right and my right mind that it says to &#039;not write any spoilers&#039;, mental blank maybe or just my past acting up... But once again I must apologise and hope that you can forgive me. I will remove the spoilers for future readers and for current or past readers, I really do apologise. And without a further ado... I must add that there are some slight spoilers but not as much as before <br />
<br />
A sense

          <span style="display: none;" id="review80628">
        of nostalgia was the first reaction I had, and what most people would. A past of imagination and fun. We laughed, cried, even danced for things that bring us joy. Being a high school student, we move on, banishing our past. Some say that our past allows us to move on and run away from it. Perhaps from fear? Embarrassment?  Concern? Maybe Maturity. But, we can never run away as it is always a part of us, it makes us a special, unique individual.<br />
<br />
That is how Chuunibyou in my opinion is portrayed. As a reflection on our past and how it shaped our future. <br />
<br />
Chuunibyou is translated as “Eighth-Grade Syndrome.” An epidemic for people in the eight grade. A certain website states that it is a slang term depicting three different cases: The antisocial types, ones with the &#039;cool&#039; factor, and ones who admire mystical powers and recreates them in reality through their imagination.<br />
<br />
Story and Characters: (9)<br />
<br />
Chuunibyou&#039;s main characters include: Togashi Yuuta, Takanashi Rikka, Nibutani Shinka, Dekomori Sanae, Tsuyuri Kumin and Isshiki Makoto (Uhh... Is he a main?)<br />
<br />
Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! depicts a newly enrolled high school student, Togashi Yuuta. A teenager whose past is what he thinks as banished from his mind, a few head bangs on his wall is an example. He enters high school with a clean slate, so he says. &quot;Dark Flame Master&quot; his faked ulterior personality due to having a different mindset of his friends. <br />
<br />
Takanashi Rikka. A person with a rather serious case of Chuunibyou. And is expressed by rather peculiar movements and stances that the responders cannot help but laugh. But in future episodes she experiences development of mind, heart and soul. <br />
<br />
Nibutani Shinka, the classmate of the two above and Isshiki, relates to Yuuta in the way of wanting to forget about her chuunibyou past. She is also the motherly type I suppose and expresses this love towards other characters giving her a rather lovable personality and character. <br />
<br />
Dekomori... Smart... but just weird. Not saying she&#039;s a bad character but was one of the most strongest, bringing powerful scenes towards the end. But either way, she too has Chuunibyou, with twin tails which are... heavy. Yeah that would hurt, right Nibutani?<br />
<br />
Isshiki, doesn&#039;t play much of a role but plays a good comedic role like a side character (referring to Clannad and Little Busters if you know what I&#039;m talking about)<br />
<br />
Kumin-senpai is an admirer of people with Chuunibyou. A rather peculiar, sleepy case who in turn plays a huge role towards the end. <br />
<br />
Art: (10)<br />
Kyoto Animation presents stunning quality in their animation. Well I&#039;m no expert but it was truly outstanding as always. <br />
<br />
Sound: (9)<br />
Atmospheric background music is best for bringing out character development and emotions towards the viewers. Kyoani successfully manipulated music to their advantage and used that initiative to have an awesome soundtrack.The timing of the music is what I&#039;m speaking of. The dramatic music played at the right times, the foreshadowing, comedic etc. allows people to be drawn into the same environment of chuu2. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: (10)<br />
Everything from Chuunibyou was enjoyable. The comedy and romance both created and anime for everyone joy, happiness and some sad scenes had drawn my attention from the beginning. Chuu2 has this element that would make the haters of moe, romantic-comedic genres become entranced into this show. That element is for you, the viewers to find out. <br />
<br />
And of course Overall (10). As MAL states it was just Outstanding. Everything about it is lovable. I&#039;m out of words at the moment so I cannot explain how great this anime is. Viewers looking for a balanced romantic comedy with some drama, this is for you. <br />
<br />
This is my first review. I had fun typing up this and being the first for this anime brings me great pleasure to do so. Please if it doesn&#039;t trouble you say if this was helpful or not, I&#039;d like to continue reviewing if people like reading it. And please mind my English, never was good at it hehe. Thanks for reading and hope I didn&#039;t waste your time XD<br />
<br />
EDIT: I appreciate the criticism people expressed to me. Granted some (one) of them were not constructive but I really do appreciate what people said to me. Thanks for the comments :)<br />
<br />
And finally: Reality be rent. Synapse break. Banishment, this WORLD!!

    Suppose you watch a work that seems to have a lot of effort put into it. It’s easy to tell the staff members have worked their ass off to make this work look pretty. Gorgeous character designs and backgrounds. Hell, it’s possible to just watch the show for the art. Turn off the sounds and take off the subtitles from the screen. It’s fantastic animation. I expect nothing less from Kyoto Animation, which has given us Hyouka gifs on our Tumblr. To expect mediocrity in art direction is an insult to the members of this talented studio.<br />
<br />
Yet, prettiness is not always watchable. When the plot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review80608">
        dives, frustration skyrockets. Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai suffers from its poor writing. There are clichés on every step.<br />
<br />
Take the premise of chuunibyous, which roughly translates into ‘eighth grade syndrome.’ This social phenomena is worth exploring despite the lack of attention to it. I’m glad the writers are giving this attention. Some may call this Kyoto Animation’s answer to “Welcome to the NHK”, a critique of hikikomori and depressive disorders. It can be good, albeit bitter, medicine for people still suffering from the syndrome.<br />
<br />
However, Chu2koi finds delight in such escapism. Not that it’s a bad thing -- it saves this work from the need of being ultra-preachy. You can’t really create such a provocative work in just 12 episodes. KyoAni is a master of slice-of-life humor, as seen in the K-On! franchise. In the genre where girls drink tea and eat cake, add in crazy animations of teens pretending they’re superheroes and we get a comedic masterpiece. If this work stays that way, I wouldn’t feel the need to write this review.<br />
<br />
Instead, KyoAni apparently wanted to preach... something.<br />
<br />
This is where it gets messy. I have no idea who to blame, but the writing suddenly took a dramatic turn. KyoAni is trying desperately hard to combine Chu2koi’s unique humor and dramatic preaching. In the first half of the series, it’s humorous. The latter half shows grim, dark melodrama. Its main characters, Rikka and Yuuta, are introduced as a dynamic comedic pair; in the end, they whine at every moment possible. Melodramatic events surround the protagonists while the supporting characters goof around. <br />
<br />
Chu2koi is, in a word, bipolar.<br />
<br />
Because of these senseless, abrupt changes in tone and mood, you don’t really understand where the work is going, let alone what it is about. When the work finally gives some closure, there is much to be questioned. It feels rushed; there are contradictions and glaring plot-holes in the final episodes. Bandaging those plot-holes with clichés just makes it worse. They’re an eyesore. You can separate the final episode into sections -- and in these sections pinpoint which scene of Chu2koi ripped off from which anime. Supporting characters, who did nothing in this work, suddenly become important. One character who did nothing for the first twelve episodes except being cute became an important character in the finale. Anime-original character Dekomori fares better because she is relevant to the plot. But because she is a comedic character, she unintentionally destroys atmospheres in dramatic episodes. The script is just plain chaotic.<br />
<br />
And so the confusing million-dollar question: Does this work actually have something to say? It does end with a message, but it’s not convincing with all these mood whiplashes. I hear its sermon, but it’s gibberish. It seems to accept the chuunibyou culture as a facet of individualism; yet, once you take Rikka’s reason for the desperate escapism, it becomes nonsense. It’s hard to explain what this work is saying.<br />
<br />
But it’s undeniable Chu2koi is a good work if we look at other technicalities. Animation and music are superb as always. Ignoring the plot, the characters are fun to watch. Their interactions make anyone envious of their lives. It’s a good slice-of-life comedy.<br />
<br />
Which begs the question: why did this work not stay that way? The first half is strong; the second half is just unwatchable melodrama. It is despairing that Chu2koi has so much potential. Instead, it wanted to be something like Welcome to the NHK. <br />
<br />
In a one-cour show, the themes have to be focused. To diverge off and be something else is absurd. Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai tries too much to be something special, but falls off from the ladder; it’s just too emotionally unstable like an angsty teenager.

    Well, it sort of feels like a blast from the past. Kinda makes you look at times in your childhood when you played ninjas or superpowers with your friends at school when you were young and how embarrassing it would be if you were to try that now in highschool, the looks on peoples faces and stares. <br />
<br />
Right now the story hasn&#039;t progressed too much 4 episodes in, right now I think the characters are just being introduced. I can feel the romance progressing in the future and it looks promising, but for now its just a typical slice of life moe girls doing cute

          <span style="display: none;" id="review76823">
        things. The ability of this anime to invoke a sense of sympathy for Yuuta, when Rikka does something cute but embarrassing is pretty incredible. In my head if i were in Yuutas position I&#039;d just like &quot;Oh gawd, please shtap,&quot; as Rikka acts out her battle with an imaginary demon king in front of a bunch of people. <br />
<br />
The main reason I&#039;ve come to watch this anime is of course Art, Rikka is too damn cute, god damn she might be the cutest character in all the anime&#039;s I&#039;ve seen. I&#039;m not sure what it is, her cute hair or the eye patch shes just too mesmerizing. I&#039;m also pretty happy the main male protagonist isn&#039;t a god damn bishounen, hes just your average guy trying to be a normal high schooler. The battle scenes are also not bad, made to show the exaggerated imagination of Rikka as she battles creatures from over dimensions, which then transitions into real life as you see Rikka jumping around with her over dramatic acting out of her imagination, its very enjoyable to watch :].<br />
<br />
Oh my, the sound Rikka makes when she gets hit on the head is moe-diculous, yeah I made a new fucking word to describe a sound. I&#039;m also happy that her voice actress is actually pretty hot, Uchida Maaya props to you for making cute sounds when getting hit, they&#039;re not a lot of hot voice actresses and I&#039;m happy Rikka has one . The ending song is actually pretty catchy as well I even downloaded it.<br />
<br />
Characters of this anime, Rikka is obviously the best, so innocent and pure minded adds to her cuteness. I feel Yuuta&#039;s pain as he tries to shut away a part of his life hoping it to never resurface, I especially empathize with wanting to go back in time to punch yourself, I mean who doesn&#039;t want to go back in time and punch themselves for something embarrassing they&#039;ve done?  <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve enjoyed this anime quite a bit, and I&#039;m going to try to go on hiatus to save as many episode as possible so I can marathon through to experience great amounts of entertainment, however I probably won&#039;t last long because I&#039;m already twitching to see the next episode :[.<br />
<br />
All in all, it looks like a promising anime, I can&#039;t wait until this animes finished so I can watch it all in one go, if you want a unique anime experience or just want to a comedy of with cute moe girls watch Chuunibyou demo koi Shitai! its worth it.<br />

    Sometimes, initial impressions can be highly deceiving. Chuunibyou is an example of that.<br />
<br />
Incorporating elements of drama, moe and SoL, Chuunibyou is a superb show, displaying a remarkable level of literary and technical depth, and appealing to many different viewers as well.<br />
<br />
Drama, characterization and plot are well executed, making this show one of the most enjoyable this season. It is only around the later episodes that one truly comes to appreciate the level of thoughtfulness and sophistication that went into the creation of this show. Whilst the first 1-8 episodes seem like pointless interactions, it is later revealed to be metaphorical to the inner struggles of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review80192">
        Rikka, the female lead. In this respect, it is even better than Clannad which, for the first half IS just messing around.<br />
<br />
Story and character is superb. Rikka steals the main focus of the show in the latter half of the show, reveling an interesting, well fleshed out character. Yuuta, as the level headed male lead, provides the driving push behind the plot. On the other hand, Nibutani and Dekkomori act as supporting characters, at times providing support for Rikka and at the same time assisting in her character development. Nibutani is an interesting character in that she hides part of her character. Her personality is caustic, and yet she acts as the motherly figure for many of the characters. To top it off, she, like Yuuta, is a past [spoiler], which adds to the comedy. Whilst it is true that each character falls under a specific archetype, they are all masterfully expressed and their personalities certainly do not feel overused.<br />
<br />
Humor is well executed, drawing on the various quirks of all the characters to provide an enjoyable watch regardless of the story. One criticisms I have is that both Isshiki and Kumin could both be removed without impacting on the overall show, although both are integrated in a way that is hardly obtrusive to the developments of the main characters.<br />
<br />
As expected from KyoAni, art and sound is equally as impressive. Character design is original, with the short quick &quot;Chuunibyou&quot; scenes allowing KyoAni to show off their animation skills. Another criticism that could be added is that the art is rather typical, and there is certainly a high level of similarity in the way the eyes have been drawn. Despite this, the art is certainly superb. Shading, detail and lighting has been well done, contributing greatly to the general feel and atmosphere. Music is fitting, and the OP sets a lighter tone for the darker themes in the latter episodes. Elements of moe has been undoubtedly incorporated, and expressed mainly in Rikka(heck since when has KyoAni made anything that doesn&#039;t have moe). Although some may object, the moe certainly adds to Rikka&#039;s character, reminding us at times that she is still a (human) girl. And to be honest, I like some moe fanservice.<br />
<br />
Overall, Chuuinbyou has been an excellent show that has stood out in this slightly lackluster season. Highly, highly recommended.<br />
<br />
<br />

    *to those lazy people who just want to see a quick summary, just skip to the end*<br />
<br />
I’m pretty sure that no matter who you are, where you live, and what you’re stature in life is, you’ve once dreamt of the supernatural. You know, like having special powers that set you apart from others, or living in a floating castle in the sky. But of course, regardless of that, there came a time when we all decided to forget such delusions and become a proper part of the society. Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai, otherwise known as Chuu-2, is an anime that focuses on such delusions.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review80694">
        <br />
<br />
Chuu-2 shows us the story of Yuuta, your everyday, run-of-the-mill, high school teenage boy. Or so he seems. In the past he seems to have been infected with one of the most widespread, embarrassing, and even humiliating disease of all time, and that is Chuunibyou. Chuunibyou is something that every normal person has gone through in his life, and that the delusions that come with the developing of one’s mind during the second year of middle school, and thus the name Chuunibyou. Now, the thing is, each case of Chuunibyou is different from one person to another, and Yuuta happened to have a really bad case of it, making him act out his delusions to the point of going to school in costume fighting enemies that don’t exist. But as with every person, he soon realized what he was doing, and became slightly traumatized with embarrassment. So, after graduating middle school, he decided to put everything behind him, and start fresh in a school where nobody knows of his dark past. Now, here comes Rikka, a person who, even until high school, still has her Chuunibyou. With her discovering Yuuta’s hidden secret, she drags him into all sorts of situations, and so the story begins.<br />
<br />
With that short summary of the story, you might be asking “what is so great about this anime?” First off, it is literally one of the funniest anime I’ve ever watched. Everything, from the epic fight scenes that Rikka imagines down to her reactions when Yuuto hits her in the head is just priceless. What’s more is that the jokes they tell not only makes you laugh, but actually hits you right in the face. Chuu-2 shows us what we were when we were young and still unembarrassed with our delusional dreams for the future. It gives you a feeling of nostalgia, like you can almost be certain that back then, you also thought of being a hero of justice or something like that. So to make a long statement short, not only is it funny, you can actually relate to the things that they are doing, or even the way they think. <br />
<br />
Another thing is that the plot itself was straightforward. It doesn’t wander around from this to that but just focuses on both Yuuta and Rikka, the two main protagonist of the story. It shows their lives just like any self-respecting slice of life anime does, with a little twist in the middle when the anime starts to pick up speed and transform from a comedy slice of life to a somewhat romantic drama. What is really amazing about it though is that even with that transition, it still managed to stay true to its concept. At the start it was about some high school students with Chuunibyou and in the end, it still was. Even if the transition made it more serious and dramatic, the core concept was still there, and that is about these students trying to let go of their delusions. Lastly, the thing I liked the most about this anime is its conclusive ending. Although this might not be really good because it lowers the chance of Chuu-2 having a second season, it’s still better than leaving us hanging. The ending left no plotholes, and is overall solid, leaving a warm and fluffy feeling after watching the entire series.<br />
<br />
Aside from the plot itself, one of the things that make Chuu-2 so great is its characters. Each one of them is them is unique in their own way and is refreshing to watch. Rikka for example, is the main source of the gags in the anime due to her extremely unpredictable nature. She is the kind of character who is usually creates the complications and problems in the plot and is also the love interest of Yuuta. Yuuta on the other hand is more of the straight man who usually solves and stops Rikka from doing embarrassing things. Aside from that he also once had Chuunibyou and called himself “Dark Flame Master”, which caused him to be the center of some gags throughout the anime. Aside from them, there are also a few supporting characters, namely: Dekomori, Rikka’s best friend and apparent servant, Isshiki, Yuuta’s best friend and a source of comic relief in the story, Nibutani, the beautiful class rep. and a school idol who used to have Chuunibyou and called herself Forest Summer, and the last one, Kumin, their sempai who just likes to nap. Now, this is where Chuu-2 really shines. The characters are just perfect for the premise of the story. They’re funny, cute and most of all, relatable. Along with, the character development is also pretty smooth. It can be quite sudden, but it’s not without proper cause and is justifiable. <br />
<br />
And of course, there’s always the animation and music. Although having beautiful graphics isn’t really crucial to making a good anime, but damn this anime is really animated really well. Everything was smooth, no inconsistencies as far as I can tell, and is pretty much just eye candy. And those fight scenes. Having been spawned from a Chuunibyou’s imagination, it can be really over the top sometimes, but it’s really good enough to rival those of some shounen anime. But of course, since it was done by KyoAni, which is known for its high quality animations, this is pretty much a given. The music is also just as good. Heck, you can even watch the anime just for the music itself, although I really wouldn’t recommend it. The opening, Sparkling Daydream, is an lively and upbeat song which can pretty much give you a general idea of the comedy and chaos that’s about to ensue later into the episode. The ending, Inside Identity, is more of a j-rock song which is also pretty catchy as well.<br />
<br />
So overall, I found Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai as the best comedy/romance anime of 2012 and one of the best of all time. I highly recommend it to everyone, especially to those who have a soft spot for romcoms. But still, regardless of your taste in anime, it’s only 12 episodes long, so it won’t really take much time, so why not give it a try? After all you might come to like it.<br />
<br />
So to provide a quick summary for those lazy people who have another serious disease which they commonly abbreviate as TL;DR syndrome, I’ll just list the pros and cons of the anime.<br />
<br />
+Funny<br />
+Easily Relatable<br />
+Fairly straightforward but highly entertaining plot<br />
+Conclusive ending<br />
+Stays true to its concept/doesn’t try to be what it isn’t<br />
<br />
-Due to the story being straightforward, the plot can be somehow predictable<br />
-If you hate moe, you might not like this<br />
-Can cause hysterical laughter which leads to lightheadedness and stomachaches<br />
<br />

    After watching a few episodes, I felt that it was necessary to review it. So far, this anime has been like a dream, coming and going almost instantly, just like the theme of youth and adolescence that comes and goes. It hits me that this anime is somewhat different. It&#039;s like, if you mixed your run of the mill slice of life anime, and baked at 400 degrees for twelve minutes, and then sprinkled in a cup of action, this is what you would get. If you came to watch the action, unfortunately, you may be disappointed. Because there just isn&#039;t that much. You get

          <span style="display: none;" id="review76149">
        a couple of minutes of it per episode, but it&#039;s not the main focus. What truly makes this anime stand out in my mind is the fluid transitions between the fantasy-like action and the relatively normal high school life. <br />
<br />
Everything is what you would come to expect of Kyoto Animation. The animation quality is high, the music is well selected and well done, and the characters are endearing in their own weird way. <br />
<br />
The animation quality and art looks great. As expected from KyoAni, there is a lot of detail in the backgrounds, and very fluid animations. The OP is awesome. Especially the finger twirling. <br />
<br />
The sound matches the scenes well. There&#039;s no strange dissonance from the scene and the music. The sounds draws you into the scenes more, rather than push you out.<br />
<br />
The characters look very average (except Rikka), but their characterization sets them apart from the average slice of life. KyoAni seems prone to make male protagonists that complain a lot, and Togashi is no exception. With Togashi playing the straight man, and Rikka up to her usual antics, this duo makes this anime very enjoyable. The characters that eventually come along, Sanae, Tsuyuri,  and Nibutani, creates an interesting mix of those stuck in eighth grader syndrome, those who want to forget about their eighth grader syndrome, and those who look like they never had anything to do with it in the first place. <br />
<br />
Even above the characters, I think the reason that I would rate it so highly right at the beginning is the lesson that it teaches, and how it reflects on these characters. We have Togashi, who tries to forget his pretend identity, the Dark Flame Master, and Rikka, who is still consumed by her power, the Tyrant&#039;s eye. Although embarrassing for Togashi, it&#039;s obvious right away that it&#039;s very enjoyable for Rikka. I would relate this to growing up, really. There are those who try to grow up as soon as they can, those who stay as children for a bit longer, and those who never really grow up. Look how fun and interesting life is for those who keep their imagination and sense of wonder alive. But, unfortunately, time moves on, and eventually, you&#039;re expected to grow up, and many do. So, the valuable lesson this show teaches, is that you should stay a kid, and enjoy being a kid for as long as you can. Those carefree years full of wonder and intrigue is extremely valuable, and often, you can never get them back. So cherish it, and don&#039;t be in a hurry to grow up.<br />

    Despite the adolescent delusions, I want to fall in love! is KyoAni&#039;s newest masterpiece. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10 moeblob harem and a loli, plus action, fuckyeah. Also school settings and the characters create a club. Very original for them. <br />
Characters: 9/10 loli moeblob and a harem, my favorite, but there is more than one male character which is a minus. <br />
Art: 10/10 moe, almighty moe, awe-inspiring moe. Fucking moe, man.<br />
Sounds: 8/10 loli voiced by someone else than Kugimiya Rie, not a smart move.<br />
Enjoyment: moe = masterpiece of entertainment, moe = made of enjoyment. I also worship this anime and Mr. Peter is my favorite drink.<br />

<br />
Seriously said. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review75977">
        ending theme sounds good and the animation is cool during action scenes. The character design is ugly and all the characters are moeblobs. Comedy is often meh and nothing much happens beyond characters existing in their moest moe-form. If you aren&#039;t fan of moe then do not watch because then you won&#039;t appreciate this. I can enjoy moe, but there is a certain limit of how much I can bear. In Koi ga Shitai&#039;s case it&#039;s like you order a cheese sandwich, but instead of getting it with cheese slices they bring the whole fucking cheese and tell you to eat it. It&#039;s appalling, not tasty. Thanks for reading this short but rather cute analysis~

    Ok where only 3 episodes in  but i felt like talking about this anime as im waiting for others to be subbed right now. Anyways Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai is a typical comedy, school life anime that leans toward a harem genre. Its selling point is the theme revolving around chuunibyous as stated by the title. For those who do not know wat chuunibyous are, it literally means &quot;eighth grade syndrom&quot;, basically meaning a short period of time when a person is heavily influenced by something (generally anime) and  believe they are a mythical existence or have supernatural powers (ex. Kobato Hasegawa

          <span style="display: none;" id="review75199">
        of Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai). Now for the rundown<br />
<br />
Story: NA<br />
Nothing so far as they are only 3 episodes in and i don&#039;t want to ruin what happens for those that haven&#039;t watched the anime yet.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
Good art as clear effort can be seen put into the anime. You won&#039;t see heavy recycling of scenes like for those low budget animes. Effects for there action skits are really well done which is surprising for school life anime and a hell of a lot better than the ones seen in some action anime that recently came out... cough cough... Campione. <br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
Nice BGM that fits well with the atmosphere of the anime. Loving the op and ending, especially the ending as its now one of my favourite anime songs.<br />
<br />
Characters: 7<br />
Honestly average character designs in my opinion but there still cute and made memorable by their individual personalities and character traits. But then there&#039;s the main character who, i guess following the current trend of main characters in school life, looks pretty dam normal (looks way better and interesting in the flash backs he has). Good voice acting and nice pronunciation of english words(in that japanese way of course) though. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
So far I&#039;m really enjoying the anime so far. It really makes me nostalgic as I had my own chunnibyou period when I was a kid and just writing about it makes me wana bang my head into the wall just to forg...just a minute...<br />
ok back so ya really enjoyable watch for those who want a comical, easygoing, eye pleasing anime to help us with our emotional outbreaks after watching some of the really intense series.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
Really promising so far and i definitely recommend for others to watch. <br />
<br />
This is my first review so sorry for the awkwardness if you noticed it. Thanks for reading till the end for those with enough patients to go through my personal thoughts of the anime and for those who thought it was a bunch of nonsense from a guy that has no idea what he is talking about... well anyways have fun watching the anime guys.<br />

    There&#039;s nothing to see here, just another generic moe anime.<br />
<br />
Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is another one of KyoAni&#039;s generic moe anime that have little to no story, and is just plain moe + humor. They&#039;ve done this style so many times, that it&#039;s getting just annoying watching them repeat the same style for each anime they do. Why are they stuck on the moe train? Do they really only want to appeal to the otakus who watch anime, not for it&#039;s story, for the character&#039;s &quot;moeness&quot;? KyoAni is wasting their talent on these &quot;moeblobs&quot;, when they could be using their quality animation on bigger

          <span style="display: none;" id="review79846">
        and better things.<br />
<br />
First, story. What story? Chunnibyou doesn&#039;t have a story. It&#039;s pure moe and humor as I said above. It has some &quot;action&quot; scenes, that really couldn&#039;t be anymore pointless, because they&#039;re not really happening, it&#039;s just in their imagination. The humor is funny at times, but really, I think I&#039;ve smiled maybe two or three times during 10 episodes. It&#039;s just not that funny. The characters overexaggerate to anything that it just makes me facepalm it rather then try to force myself to find it amusing. It&#039;s not funny. <br />
<br />
Art and Sound are both fine, as expected from KyoAni. Nothing more to say here.<br />
<br />
Now for the Characters, this is where I&#039;m really going to rip on this anime. <br />
The MC, Yuuta Togashi, is as generic as you can possibly think of. His personality is as generic as ever. I can really name over 50 other male MCs who act the same exact way as he does. And I can also name over 50 other male MCs who even resemble him. He&#039;s the definition of a generic MC. He&#039;s your typical, dumb male main character, who is socially awkward, and a bit of a nerd. Yep, I&#039;ve never seen this before! Just as any other male MC, he wouldn&#039;t know if a girl liked/loved him if she shouted in his ear &quot;I FUCKING LOVE YOU, YOU IDIOT&quot;. He probably say &quot;Huh..? What do you mean? You think apples are good?&quot; A lot of anime today seem to have a fetish to make the male MC as dumb as possible. Why do they do this? I wonder...<br />
<br />
The female MC, Rikka Takanashi, is again, another generic character with no personality what-so-ever. She might as well be a copy of Mei Misaki from &quot;Another&quot;, except her eye patch is on the opposite eye and she isn&#039;t gothic. But their personalities are roughly identical. And when I say that, I mean they don&#039;t have personalities. Rikka, just like Mei, is your typical obscure female MC, who&#039;s true motives/goals are obscure. Rikka isn&#039;t special at all. She&#039;s boring and she doesn&#039;t do anything funny. When she has her rare serious moments, I really can&#039;t take them seriously because I haven&#039;t really become attached to her, or seen her act like a real human being. She&#039;s like a robot who doesn&#039;t know any better and doesn&#039;t respond to intelligence. <br />
<br />
The other female characters, such as Shinka, Sanae, Kuzuha, are boring too. Sanae is probably the most interesting out of all of them, and that&#039;s not a good thing. Shinka is your sterio-typical cheerleader, who is self-centered and a drama queen. Sanae is there just for the moe and comedy. Kuzuha - I STILL don&#039;t know her purpose in this anime. She&#039;s the most boring out of all of them. She&#039;s often sleeping in random places, which was slightly funny the first 2 or 3 times, but now it&#039;s just lame and they keep over-using a gag that wasn&#039;t that funny to begin with. This reminds me of Fuko in Clannad, her appearances were annoying and as pointless as you can possibly imagine. Touka, or Rikka 2.0, is as boring and personality-less as Rikka.<br />
<br />
I will finish this anime because it is only 12 episodes, but I do NOT recommend it. It&#039;s generic. I mean, if generic moe anime is your thing, and you don&#039;t give a fuck about character development, plot, then this anime is perfect for you. There are a lot of better anime out there than this one.

    Once upon a time, there was a really good friend of mine from middle school. Let’s call him Jim. One day Jim came to the brilliant conclusion that he was on the brink of something amazing: becoming a super sayin. Mesmerized by his words of stupidity, we all gathered around as Jim concentrated and let out this loud, flamboyant scream for what seemed like 10 minutes and in the end……………well………….let’s just say his parents had buy a new rug for the classroom.<br />
<br />
Now you might be asking yourself, what does that stupid story have to do with Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!? Well everything actually because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review80094">
        it turns out that Jim was a victim of what I now know as Chuunibyou, or 8th Grade Syndrome. Chuunibyou is a condition where, during a child’s adolescence, they will start to mix fantasy with reality and it’s this condition that the entire series revolves around. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Our main protagonist Yuta (someone who HAD Chuunibyou in middle school) hopes to start fresh when he enters high school because of his utter embarrassment at who he thought he was and what he could do. These plans get quickly smashed when he runs into Rikka (someone who still HAS Chuunibyou) who becomes attached to him only to serve as a constant, embarrassing reminder of who he once thought he was.<br />
<br />
A friend of mine described this series as “that of a delusional loli and a normal boy who takes pity on her.” And I think,for the first 5 episodes, that’s pretty accurate. <br />
<br />
As the series goes on, however, we discover more about Rikka and realize that her delusions aren’t that of someone who is confusing fantasy and reality, but rather someone who is using fantasy to escape from reality.<br />
<br />
The show exemplifies good pacing as every episode will either leave you in suspense or satisfied. Being a slice of life, school setting anime, the series has its fair share of drama, romance and a wide variety of humor that makes you laugh and moments that will make you cry manly tears when its suppose to. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Yuta seems as normal as they come but he’s not one of those typical, I’m bland, I can’t make up my mind type of normal characters. He gets annoyed, has delusions and gets a crush on the prettiest girl in school just like any other high school boy but he is in no way boring. Throughout the series, Yuta, as he learns more about Rika as well as himself, starts making decisions which can actually affect his development out of adolescence and into maturity. He is a character that grows, learns and makes mistakes. Plus, his over the top reactions to him being glorified as the “Dark Flame Master” (His Chuunibyou counterpart) are one of the main highlights of the series but that’s not his only role. <br />
<br />
Then there’s Rika. This girl is so cute I think needs her own Moe archetype. Despite the fact that she acts like she’s some kind of supernatural being with the powers of darkness, there are also times were she acts like…well…a normally innocent, shy teenage girl and while the series is mainly done from Yutas normal point of view, every now and then we’ll see things from Rikas Chuunibyou perspective. <br />
<br />
The fact that these two are the protagonists doesn’t make any part of the main cast less enjoyable or relatable for that matter. What’s great about the main cast in the series is that each of them seems to represent some different aspect of aging and maturity despite most of them being high schoolers. This in turn only makes the maturity Rikka and Yuta go through more apparent.<br />
<br />
Shinka Nibutani – she represents adulthood (she can’t stand childish things and aside from being a total bitch, she is the most mature of the cast)<br />
<br />
Sanae Dekomori – she, like Rikka, represents someone with Chuunibyou but in a more natural sense<br />
<br />
Makoto Isshiki – he represents a typical high school who reminds me of someone from Clannad (cough Sunohara cough)<br />
<br />
Kumin Tsuyuri – due to her constant nap taking and earnest attempts at understanding Rikka and Dekomori’s delusions, I can only assume that she represents the elderly<br />
<br />
This array of cast members defiantly helps reinforce the whole them of maturity and growing up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
What can I say other than amazing. A great amount of detail was placed into not only the main cast but even the side characters showed a great amount of detail in their designs. <br />
<br />
Kyoto Animation&#039;s, also did a magnificent job with the backgrounds and scenery to the point where, when the stories point of view was changed to that of Rikka or someone else with Chuunibyou, I actually forgot I was watching a slice of life. The design shown in exemplifying these made up powers surprisingly looked better then artwork that is most commonly found in most fantasy works you’d find today.<br />
<br />
The pallet choice of color was also interesting. Kyoto Animation mostly incorporated dark colors like brown, purple and dark blue in most of the designs yet the series itself didn’t have a dark feel to it. This contrast, if anything, made the series more unique and refreshing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Music:<br />
The funny thing about the opening is that it actually gives you more fan service then the actual series (not that it’s that kind of show anyway but you get my point). The opening is very face paced and upbeat while the ending theme seems very dark and Goth; a good foreshadow of how the series starts off happy and funny but slowly gets serious. <br />
<br />
Theme:<br />
If I haven’t already stated it before, the main theme that this series tries to present is the idea of growing up and maturing. Everyone in life (some sooner than later) need to realize that sometimes the past must be left behind. Some of us miss our pasts, and some of us are embarrassed by them but for whatever the reason may be, excepting the fact that we must grow up and face reality, no matter how hard it may be, is something that we have to do.  This is presented strongest through Rikka whose delusions can be considered as denial to her traumatic past. However, even though the past must be left behind, that doesn’t mean it must be warped or forgotten, it must be accepted so we can move.<br />
<br />
So the question is: Is Chuunibyou really bad?<br />
<br />
Naturally as we get older, we may realize how rediculous it is to act like a super sayin. Others may think that acting in such a way is better than acting.....well....normal. Cause lets face it, sometimes normal is boring and can suck. We wanna feel special, unique, like we&#039;re more important than other normal people.<br />
<br />
This might sound silly, but think about it, no matter how old you get, dont we want to consider ourselves special and unique? Isnt that were individuality comes from?<br />
<br />
In the end, even when we eventually grow out of our Chuunibyou faze, the feelings we had that sparked it, the feeling of coming out of our shells and becoming our own person, always remain.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Overall, this series is one of my favorite of the season. It’s fresh, colorful and original. To be honest, its almost like watching Toy Story as it lets me recal some moments from my own adolesence (for better, for worse). If you are a fan of slice of life, romance or school setting anime, then this is the perfect choice for you. <br />

    Chuunibyou Demo Koi Ga SHitai!<br />
<br />
Story	7/10<br />
<br />
	Chuunibyou Demo Koi Ga Shitai! opens with a meaningful opening, and ends beautifully. The plot is balanced with emotions, dramas, and comedies all together in one, creating a strong and well depth story. Although, Chuu2byou have some meaningless episodes, but the plot still manages to do well to balanced the story up.<br />
<br />
Art		8/10  <br />
<br />
	As a modern anime, I’m not surprised I gave art 8 to Chuu2byou. The anime have a balanced contrast color, beautiful background, and well-produced character design. <br />
<br />
Sound		8/10<br />
<br />
The background music did very well to mix up with the stories. Opening and ending song is practically fit to the story.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review145079">
        The seiyuu once again did a great job in giving the emotion in the air. <br />
<br />
Character 	8/10<br />
<br />
	Chuu2byou prove that their characters are more than a picture. Basically, the character development run well,  the character is entertaining the watchers as well. Each character balanced with personalities, emotions, and many other components combined together. Leaving good characters indeed.<br />
<br />
Excitement	8/10<br />
<br />
	Chuu2byou brings a massive excitement to persuade me to watch it ‘till finish. The anime, filled with comedies, dramas, but keep to the point of the story until the end. The story itself is not boring, it’s different in a good way.<br />
<br />
Final  		8/10 <br />
<br />
	Chuunibyou brings another era to the romance-comedy genres. It works extremely well to be worthy since it’s balanced in all components. And finally, it’s obviously worth to watch. Anime4Life <br />

    I&#039;m autistic. I&#039;ve come a long way since I was young. Oftentimes autistic people prefer fantasy over reality. When I was in the 4th grade, I got into Yu-Gi-Oh. Unlike most normal kids, I still couldn&#039;t distinguish fantasy from reality. I truly believed that characters in cartoons were real people. I fell in love with the little Yugi. No, this wasn&#039;t some childish crush. It was basically a hardcore obsession. I raved on and on and on about how I&#039;d marry Yugi and cuddle with him and kiss him and have kids with him and all that dumb stuff. Yeah, stuff like this is normal

          <span style="display: none;" id="review87815">
        with kids in kindergarten or something, always delving into make believe stuff. But I was in the 4th grade then, and I didn&#039;t realize back then that cartoons were just drawings on paper made to move with high rez technology. I think my obsession set in motion some bullying I had to endure later on, but I don&#039;t remember as I haven&#039;t run into anyone who knew me back in the 4th grade. I didn&#039;t get out of this phase until the 6th grade. Yeah, personally I&#039;d love to bury those memories under six feet of dirt, as they&#039;re so embarrassing to look back on (and I don&#039;t think I understood that what I was doing back then was embarrassing). Everybody has embarrassing memories they wish they could bury six feet under dirt. Everybody has a time where they pretended to be something so intensely that they believed they were some fictional character for some reason. Something like this is usually common among little kids or the mentally disabled. But...in this anime, middle/high schoolers, who should CLEARLY know better, bring this up to such extraordinary and ridiculous levels, it&#039;s not even funny. Why does this thing exist?!<br />
<br />
Okay. Forgive me for sounding rude and blunt, which I don&#039;t mean to be, and I&#039;m not trying to look down on fans or people who actually used to pretend to be fantasy characters when they were young. I understand this is fiction, and I&#039;m not trying to sound like I take this a little too personally. However, there is SO MUCH wrong with this anime it&#039;s not even funny. I&#039;m surprised other people haven&#039;t pointed these things out yet, so I&#039;m going to no matter what people say to me! Let me start off with the single worst thing about this show: the way it portrays these fantasies. Now, it&#039;s not uncommon for people to pretend to be anime characters or something like that. Heck, sometimes I like to pretend I&#039;m Dilandau from Escaflowne or Usagi from Sailor Moon. Heck, when me and my friends were young, we would pretend to be Pokemon trainers and play pretend battles back when we had recess in elementary school! Of course, that was mostly because I&#039;m autistic and because we were young kids back then who wanted to have fun instead of deal with boring stuff like school or homework. Plus, we actually knew when to be lost in our fantasies and when we had to deal with reality, even though we didn&#039;t want to deal with the latter. But our main character, Yuuta, a perfectly normal and NOT physically or mentally flawed high schooler AT ALL, suddenly decided he was some Dark Flame Master and completely took on this persona. In middle school. And acted like that. IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. EVEN DURING CLASSES. IN PUBLIC!! Do you see what&#039;s wrong here? It&#039;s one thing to be a little kid and pretend to be anime characters when we&#039;re alone, but...a middle schooler?! Acting like that every single day?! In plain view of other kids, teachers, and authority figures?! Seriously, this kid SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER!! So should everyone else, despite having their reasons for deluding themselves in fantasies! Yet what does this anime do?! It tries to give it some fancy name called Eighth Grader Syndrome, or Chuunibyo as they call it. Come on people!! This isn&#039;t some phenomenon! It&#039;s just stupid kids acting out their fantasies and acting like complete idiots when they SHOULD know better! What also appalls me is the way other people react to them! They just watch looking all weird and let them do their thing! It&#039;s probably more of a cultural thing, and I&#039;m in America so Japan probably has a different view on this than Americans, but...seriously, if someone did stuff like this in real life, they&#039;d be bullied relentlessly and be reminded of it for the rest of their lives, possibly to the point of making them commit suicide! I&#039;m surprised the kids who saw Yuuta&#039;s Dark Flame Master gig didn&#039;t laugh at him or bully him or record videos of it and put it on YouTube so they could ruin his life completely!! I know that if I ever did that stuff in public, it&#039;d most certainly happen to me since I&#039;m not the most popular person in school! We all know what happened to Tyler Clementi here! Seriously, Yuuta should have known better than to do embarrassing stuff like that in public all the time!! Just the way the show portrays all of this as if it&#039;s the most normal thing in the world by making light of it and using it for comedy...how can any sane person even approve of such atrocities?!<br />
<br />
Well, if there is one thing the show does well, it&#039;s the fact that it DOES show characters who DO feel embarrassed by their past selves and flinch whenever they even run into someone they knew from those days, and that&#039;s how the show starts. Yuuta, ashamed by how audacious and retarded he acted back in middle school, even by his standards, manages to go to a new school and hopes to start anew...but then he meets some random girl named Rikka who is so lost in fantasy it&#039;s not even funny. Even Yuuta agrees with me. But unlike him, Rikka only does it outside of school (smart move!). But her antics drive Yuuta up the wall and he wants nothing to do with her. He tries to get her off his back, but she keeps on coming back no matter what despite actually telling her multiple times to back off and leave him alone. However, Rikka makes him join her &quot;society&quot;, along with a bunch of other people including a personal friend of hers, and form some stupid and pointless club whose name is so stupid I can&#039;t even remember it. Only two of said members are lost in their fantasies, Rikka and her friend, while Yuuta and three others, Shinka, Kumin, and Isshiki, just go along with their antics without really caring much except for Yuuta and Shinka. But soon, Yuuta starts to discover the real reason behind Rikka&#039;s yearning to be lost in her fantasies, especially when her older sister, Touka, also refuses to get off his back.<br />
<br />
Let me get the other ridiculously bad part out of the way: the characters. Other than Yuuta, Shinka, and later Rikka, all of the characters, even some of the adults who aren&#039;t directly involved with Rikka&#039;s life, act like such retards it&#039;s not even funny! I especially couldn&#039;t stand Rikka&#039;s ridiculously pig-tailed friend Dekomori and her constant emphasis on &quot;DESu! DESu! DESu!&quot; all the time! Every time she said a word I seriously wanted to duct tape her mouth shut! Isshiki&#039;s nothing but a girl chasing cheapskate (though admittedly he DOES actually decide to go after one single girl later), and Kumin...oh God. She has to be the single most stupid and annoyingly bland character in the ENTIRE cast. Why? All she likes to do is sleep and act forcedly cute with her squeaky voice! That&#039;s it! And even in the end she acts stupid but for a different reason entirely! The only characters in this show who actually have their brains even remotely in tact are Yuuta, Shinka, and members of Rikka&#039;s family, and the former two only act normal AFTER they get over their silly fantasies! I actually applaud Yuuta for being strong-minded and saying what&#039;s on his mind, not being totally bland and indecisive even though he gets dragged into stupid stuff against his will. At least he MAKES IT CLEAR that he hates what he&#039;s being dragged into. Yeah, he&#039;s loud, brash, selfish, insensitive and does treat Rikka badly in the beginning, but in this case, I&#039;d find it rather justified, as no normal person acts the way she (or he did when he was young) does in real life! I hated every interaction between them, especially the time where Yuuta shaves Isshiki&#039;s head with very pointless and melodramatic screaming and crying, and when Shinka and Dekomori fought like cats and dogs. Now, one reviewer I read about was disappointed by Touka blackmailing/threatening Yuuta into helping her fix her problems with her sister instead of doing it herself. I don&#039;t think this is the case. Maybe she DID try to help Rikka out offscreen but her attempts didn&#039;t work no matter what, so she decided to go the extra mile. That&#039;s how I think of it. But that&#039;s pretty much it.<br />
<br />
It may be KyoAni and all, but I&#039;m going to be upfront: their animation here looks really sloppy. Tamako Market looked better than this. The music is rather bland, the theme songs were annoying, and the insert songs were used in the wrong places. Ugh. Now, the only reason I watched this show was because of one reviewer&#039;s interpretation of it, and how the final episode shows a strong moral about being true to yourself, embracing the weirdness within, and not being happy with conforming because other people say so. Now, these are themes that I love to see explored in anime. Heck, right now, I&#039;m in a situation where I do do things people think as strange, but I do them in moderation and I do them to be happy, not to cause anyone trouble. Why else would we watch anime and read books and play video games than to take a break from the tiresome world around us? We want to have fun, and in a way, I understand why the characters in here do the things they do. My sister and I don&#039;t really see eye to eye since we have very different views on the world and we clash a lot. I&#039;m convinced that because of my disability, she believes I&#039;m someone who will throw a tantrum if I even remotely do anything she deems rude and inappropriate, like accidentally say the wrong thing, and who she has to watch over every single second like I&#039;m that kid from the movie Problem Child (y&#039;know, the one with Gilbert Gottfried). I may have a disability, but I KNOW what to do when I&#039;m out in public. I know how to be polite and say thank you and be appreciative and when to do something and when not to. I know all of this, yet she seems to believe that I don&#039;t and constantly reminds me of how stupid I am and seems to believe that anything I say or do, well intentioned or not, is always rude or out of malice. I don&#039;t show her the anime I watch because I&#039;m convince she&#039;ll question my motives for watching them and completely get the wrong ideas about said shows, and I LOATHE being misunderstood more than anything. I bring this thing with my sister up because later in the show, Rikka and Touka get into a similar situation which I think IS rather understandable, and even justifiable to a degree, but I won&#039;t go further for the sake of spoilers. Sure, we all love a little fun and games once in a while, especially if it&#039;s to unwind after a hard day at work or find happiness after a really bad day. I used to be bullied in school, yet anime and manga have saved me from doing stuff like doing drugs and cutting myself. I don&#039;t mind pretending I&#039;m in my safe little fantasy world and being lost in it for a short while when I&#039;m alone, and I know when to keep it in moderation. But...if it&#039;s taken to this extent, then it&#039;s just plain annoying and insulting.<br />
<br />
Now, I&#039;m NOT trying to start any backlash or flame wars or anything. I&#039;m not trying to bash the disabled or the mentally ill or anyone like that. I&#039;m not even trying to imply that the characters in the show are disabled or mentally not right in the head. Why would I do that when I myself have a disability? That&#039;s the last thing I&#039;d ever do, and I&#039;m not that kind of person, especially since I explained why I don&#039;t like this show, and I&#039;m not trying to make it sound like I still can&#039;t distinguish fantasy from reality. I know better than that, even though I do let my emotions get the better of me sometimes, not that I mean to. We all have our strange sides here and there, and we should do what makes us happy, even though society claims it&#039;s not normal and that we should act the way they want us to act, which is basically to obey everything they say, even though it feels more like they want to put us in a box because we&#039;re flawed. So what if we want to burst out and be ourselves? That&#039;s what people should do! Be themselves! Don&#039;t hold back! Do whatever makes you happy, and don&#039;t be what others want you to be just so they can feel good about themselves. Don&#039;t be poisoned by the selfish wishes of others. I love being myself. We should embrace our weirdness and enjoy it, no matter how hard people try to drag us down. But this anime approaches it in such an insulting manner it&#039;s not even funny. I KNOW for a fact that if I wanted to write a story about an anime about being true to yourself if it makes you happy despite the opinions of others, I&#039;d be able to execute it better than this! It&#039;s one thing to actually have people who pretend and play act for fun, and then there&#039;s having people do it ALL THE FREAKING TIME AND IN PUBLIC IN FRONT OF OTHERS, and the latter is just plain wrong on so many ridiculous levels.<br />
<br />
This is fine for entertainment, but if you really want an anime about being true to yourself, stay far away from this. This has ridiculous written all over it. Sorry if I sounded too personal. Just throwing my opinion out there. That&#039;s all.<br />
<br />
EDIT: It seems I&#039;ve caused some confusion in regards to the message my review has been giving out. It seems people have mis-interpreted my review as hating the show for not being realistic even though it&#039;s just a cartoon. I GET that it&#039;s a cartoon and I DO NOT hate the show for not being realistic. Did anyone even read my review word for word? I don&#039;t judge shows for realism. That&#039;s not why cartoons exist. Heck, if you look at my top 3 shows, they&#039;re anything but realistic! I despise Chuunibyou simply because I hate the insulting and downright comically insensitive way it portrays kids having vivid imaginations and taking them to a ridiculous extreme, even going as far as not having people laugh or shake their heads in contempt. Is that really so hard to understand?

    This is a spoiler-free review consisting of the entire Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! series. <br />
<br />
Chuunibyou,&quot;Eighth-grade Syndrome&quot; is a type of syndrome usually found in early teens. A symptom which makes them act upon their delusional mind. When I first heard the word &quot;Chuunibyou&quot;, I quickly thought of the long gone times where I fought against my childhood friends using the greatest techniques I&#039;ve acquired through hard sessions of cartoons and Chinese series binge watch. Is it normal to have chuunibyou? This question had been entombed deep inside my extensive memory for ages. Though as a grown man I personally find this farce exceedingly embarrassing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review352648">
        and autistic. But looking back at it again, a new question arises from the depth of my thoughts. “We all went through this, didn’t we?” <br />
<br />
Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! ( Love, Chunibyo &amp; Other Delusions! ) for me acts like a recollection archive which enabled me to recall my embarrassing past and taught me a handy life lesson.. Or more like an acknowledgement that inevitably led to my resolve to accept Chuunibyou for what it is. <br />
<br />
First season of Chuunibyou is mostly about character introduction and development. Their past, what caused them to get Chuunibyou, etc.. This season’s also where romance between main characters bloom. <br />
<br />
Second season is where Chuunibyou lays the salt. By the time you saw the thumbnail you probably figured it out already. That’s right. Rival. Love rival specifically. The drama’s pretty weak but it’s within acceptable amounts. So this season’s pretty much even more romantic buildup. And romance drama!<br />
<br />
The movie is &quot;acceptance&quot;. Yeah. That’s about it. <br />
<br />
Chuunibyou&#039;s story is quite a decent ride. It begins somewhat aggravating but as the story steadily advances you kind of just accept the vibe like a stream connecting to a lake, river or the ocean. Though the concept of a story based on eighth-grade syndrome for me kind of felt like holding a bomb without a safety pin. The bomb&#039;s even more dangerous if you’re more mature. For what reason would a grown, mature man watch a show about children with infantile psychosis? Yeah. But I don&#039;t consider it that way. Specifically, I don&#039;t condemn the show for what it is, I simply concede that fact and take heed in what the story’s trying to portray. <br />
<br />
I don’t love Chuunibyou because there are autistic kids who do autistic things. I love Chuunibyou because of the reasons behind why they became that way and the thorny path they take as a compensation for continuing to be a Chuunibyou. Uh, I hope you understand what I’m trying to say. <br />
<br />
Kyoto Animation made this so it’s obviously 10/10. Didn’t really care about the sound. Characters are good. Everything else&#039;s ok.<br />
<br />
Overall another 10/10. A very good anime. I recommend this to everybody.

    &quot;Reality, be rent. Synapse, break! Banishment, this world! ....&quot;<br />
<br />
Behold! <br />
The ultimate review by Dark Flame Reviewer Master.<br />
What? You don&#039;t know who I am? How pitiful. Well... as expected from a human commoner. It is no surprise you haven&#039;t watched this epic series yet... What!? Did you say you don&#039;t acknowledge the meaning of the word Chuunibyou? Holy Chimera, do I need to explain everything?<br />
<br />
Chuunibyou, aka 8th grade Syndrome, Pubescent Crisis, Fourteen sick, Hebephrenic schizophrenia, by the commoners, is actually the gateway to the Unseen Horizon. Only those who feel it can see the true reality. This tale presented before your eyes summons the adventures of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review121365">
        Dark Flame Master (Yuuta) and Tyrant&#039;s Eye of Truth (Rikka). However, Yuuka felt to the darkness of a common life as high school year begins. He now says that such things like magic doesn&#039;t exists and swear to never address himself by his honorable title as Dark Flame Master again. <br />
He will try to convince Rikka to believe in his new ideals, his new way of seen the world. A world were magicians and powers are just part of an illusion, part of the 8th grade syndrome. Rikka on the other hand will attempt to save this warrior&#039;s soul, and bring him back to his good old days.<br />
<br />
Along the series, a lot of character development is put in action. As our protagonists struggles with their everyday school life they will change their impressions and way of seeing things. One may notice this is one of the strongest points of this anime. The dept characters have and sometimes the dialogues full of subtext carrying the message this story wants to transmit: The meaning of growing up.<br />
-Specially in this period of great changes that high school is-<br />
The beginning of a new season, new friends, subjects and challenges. At the same time, it&#039;s the end of the childhood and some things can&#039;t possibly stay the same as they were when you were in primary school. Along with all these changes, comes together a feeling of everlasting hesitation, self doubt and you start to question how you really are. It&#039;s unquestionably an important and difficult step into the life of most of us, and it&#039;s impressive how just a few anime series that have as their focus high school touches this psychological side of it.  <br />
Then, you might thing: If it&#039;s so complicated and dramatic how can this be a comedy? <br />
Well, there is always a good side of everything, and Chuunibyou mixes both perfectly. Once again returns to the essence of slice-of-life humor, places it in an adorable environment, and proves to the world that the classical &quot;Cute&quot; is not dead. In the era of &quot;moe&quot; it&#039;s refreshing to see a slice-of-life with school girls that isn&#039;t filled with fanservice. At the surface and on the first episodes, Chuunibyou looks pretty average, besides from the great animation on the action scenes, there is nothing special to it. However, as the story progresses it starts to become clear the objective of the anime and midway through it reaches its edge.<br />
However, don&#039;t expect too much romance. unlike the title which says &quot;Regardless of My Adolescent Delusions of Grandeur, I Want a Date!&quot; this aspect was neglected for the production during almost the entire show. But you will find out why.<br />
<br />
Something interesting in Chuunibyou is that supportive characters plays important roles building the background story, as their personal memories, wishes and worries are also shared with the viewer along the story. This, although appearing to be a minor difference, helps to break with the patterned school slice-of-life with stereotyped characters so common these days.<br />
Nevertheless, originality is something difficult to discuss. <br />
I wish not enter in this merit nor question where some of the ideas for this series came from, however, some situations were difficult to fully enjoy because they were way too similar to series that came prior it. While watching, some may do the same association I did, and recall of a certain high-school girl with similar &quot;delusions&quot; and a desire to create a similar club with the objective of researching these mysterious beings and things. An air-headed teacher would allow them to do it, and they would spend most of the time goofing around. It won&#039;t be a surprise if in the next season of Chuunibyou their club decides to do a movie project. <br />
Even though, accusing something of not being original when anime is widespread over the most different genres with the most different studios is certainly a miscall. Just like this, in the matter of characters, although KyoAni uses some characteristics Slice-Of-Life fans are accustomed to, they bring together in this show lots of elements well known from their projects. A compelling storyline, great OST, voice actors and, of course, wonderful artwork and character design. <br />
This last one, plus the develop of the story and characters themselves saves the plot from being repetitive and boring just like supportive characters from being flat and just puppets of the main storyline.<br />
<br />
Chuunibyou would be perfect if it wasn&#039;t for a single planing mistake: It tries to be serious in the background but appear funny and easygoing on the outside. From the beginning producers probably knew it would be a challenging thing to do, we&#039;ve seen things like this go wrong before, and as expected this &quot;careless&quot; look takes control of the show. Basically the outside setting wouldn&#039;t allow the story to develop any further nor deeper because any change in the mood of the show would get in contrast with the atmosphere they built. This becomes explicit towards the ending when the anime had to give closure to a bunch of unsolved aspects and had to rush it in a couple of episodes. It didn&#039;t worked pretty well, as so we got a second season. <br />
Consequently, this 2nd season is only possible because of that. If the story progressed the way it was heading to, there wouldn&#039;t be material for a second season, it would end here and now. Whenever this was intentional or not, this just dropped the &#039;story&#039; and &#039;enjoyment&#039; scores of the show. After all, it still needs closure.<br />
On the other hand, worth mention, artwork and sound maintained its high quality during the entire series. Therefore, no complains with them. If KyoAni have some strong points, those are definitely part of them.<br />
<br />
Someone once said that Chuunibyou is a love letter to all anime fans. We all have our &quot;chuunibyou side&quot; and many of us went through similar situations presented on the series, so it&#039;s easy to relate to. That is one of the reasons why the series received a good approval at its premier, and is still cherished by many people.<br />
Characters as well, are affectionate and easy to attach to them (besides from being astonishing cute).<br />
For me, Chuunibyou was satisfying and enjoyable. Something that was worth watching, but after the praise-carried recommendations I&#039;ve received, I was expecting more of it. So, my piece of advice is: Watch it without any prior knowledge about it, besides from reviews of course (but be careful with spoilers). This way you will probably enjoy it much more since everything will be new for you. And if there is a highlight in this anime, it&#039;s probably its ability to surprise you, in many different and adorable ways.<br />
Numeric score: Story- 7/ Characters- 8/ Artwork- 9/ Sound- 9/ Enjoyment- 7/ Overall- 8<br />

    &quot;Another romance / comedy anime? And another eyepatch girl? Please spare us... &quot;<br />
<br />
I beg to differ.<br />
<br />
Hello fellow anime fans, my name is Gillis. This is my very first anime review and I mainly decided to write it as this anime seems to have been overlooked by many, and I at least want it to catch your attention. Heck, another eyepatch girl, some may think when they see the picture of the anime. I am like that too, but if you miss this series I won&#039;t forgive you.<br />
<br />
I have been watching anime for a long time, all the way back in grade school. When I started

          <span style="display: none;" id="review81150">
        there was already a lot of great classics to watch, and I was the self-proclaimed local Anime-guru back in the days. In the recent past two years though I&#039;ve watched many new and old series, never finding anything I have liked (there are some rare, few exceptions). Usually I just pick up a new anime when I am about to eat and then I drop it after maybe 2 episodes. In fact, I have actually dropped over 100 series (yes more than my list) and the biggest reason is that: Either it does not hook me from the start, or it just got no story. My taste is all-round, it can be anything... as long as the plot is good, not necessarily unique. The art does not have to be excellent either. For me, as said, it&#039;s all about the quality of the story.<br />
<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~<br />
Presentation<br />
~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
With that in mind, enough of my background. About 1 week ago, as I was about to sit down and eat I was lurking around on a anime stream website and picked up a random anime I had not seen. &quot;Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!&quot;. As usual I did not expect much. I just wanted to watch something random while eating my food. Heck, the only recent masterpiece I had seen most recently was Steins; Gate... and that was quite some time ago. However, as I started watching Chuunibyou I was in for a surprise. The introduction of the anime presents the interesting disease called &quot;8th-grader symptom&quot; or in japanese &quot;Chuunibyou&quot;. To summarize, it is the difficult age we&#039;ve been going through as teenagers where we do some really silly things that we all want to forget. As the explanation of this disease continues we are introduced to one of the main characters of the story, Togashi Yuuta, which was practically a textbook example of the Chuunibyou disease when he was younger, calling himself &quot;Dark Flame Master&quot; or in japanese &quot;Darku Flameu Masta&quot;. Jokes aside, the start really piqued my interest in an instant. I want you to notice that I am very skeptical as I watch new animes. That is, until I am completely seduced by it. <br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
The First Episode - *WARNING - SPOILERS* (Skip this section if you want)<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Now, the episode continues with Yuuta, having a flashback of his embarrassing past and we come to realize that his Chuunibyou state is over in the present. As he goes to dispose of his past at the balcony a rope is suddenly thrown down from the floor above and down climbs an eyepatch girl named Takanashi Rikka, the other main character of the story. Immediately, as skeptical as I am, I facepalmed right away as the scene was shown to me. &quot;By default&quot; I muttered dissatisfied, recalling about 10 other animes that had started in a similar way. Anyhow, my interest and attention had already been caught by the presentation, so I continued to watch. <br />
<br />
Rikka appeared as a really weird girl, wearing an eyepatch and some gothic clothes. Of course, weird and strange overall by climbing down from the third floor on a rope. Certainly not very original though. After this short event the opening starts and afterwards we appear on the next day as Yuuta is about to make his debut into high school and on his way, at the train station, stumble into one of the other main characters. A cute girl named Nibutani Shinka but most importantly into Rikka as well. Yuuta recalls the event that occurred the day before and realizes that she goes to the same school as he does. Of course at that moment, my skeptical sensors turns alert mode: &quot;Oh no, another harem romance show&quot;. However, my negative impression was short-lived as in that moment the train arrives and Rikka opens the automatic doors with a large swing by her arm, displaying her mental powers. With a complacent grin on her face she walks into the the train in a really cute and childish manner. Yuuta, being shocked by the moment, manages to miss his train. By this little event I was already starting to be charmed by the series.<br />
<br />
Moving on, Yuuta barely arrives in time after having missed his train. As he take a peek into his class he sees that he knows no one in there. Perfect, just as planned! Apparently Yuuta had chosen a different high school that his middle school classmates would not choose. Obviously so that he can get rid of his past filled by his miserable time as a hopeless Chuunibyo case and start a new, normal high school life. But before he enters the class he first walks to a remote area, where he speaks his catchphrase back when he was the Dark Flame Master and &quot;seals&quot; it. Though he thought he was alone, a girl could hear him. Which is with no doubt Rikka. <br />
<br />
Back in class he sits down and almost immediately gets on good terms with guy named Isshiki Makoto and soon realizes that the beauty from the train station, Nibutani, also is in the same class as him. What a blessing for his new high school life... only to shortly after find out that Rikka is in the same class as well. As if that was not enough, she suddenly creates a dramatic and embarrassing scene as she stands in front of Yuuta, grasping her eye under the eyepatch as she screams out in pain, saying something about her eye resonating. Under this sudden scene Yuuta realizes all too well what is wrong with her. It can only be a grave and serious case of Chuunibyo. On top of it, he is practically forced to take her to the infirmary where he once again confirms that she really is a dangerous case of Chuunibyo. Whats more, Rikka tells Yuuta that she had found out about his identity, namely &quot;Dark Flame Master&quot;. Now Rikka was a presence which could threaten his new dear high school life. Correctly so, later at the day he is invited by Makoto to hang out and eat lunch with some classmates. Oh the joy! What a great start to his new high school life... but the opportunity quickly vanishes as the teacher calls Yuuta in, asking him to help Rikka home as she has lost her train card. If you recall, she lives at the same building as Yuuta. Depressed, Yuuta does as told and declines the lunch invitation. And from this moment on the episode is more or less Yuuta and Rikka interacting and getting to know each other. And I must say it is more interesting, cute and funny than you would imagine.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
*END OF SPOILERS*<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Quality, Plot &amp; Characters<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
That pretty much sets the comical and romantic aspect for the series. Being Yuuta having to take care of this impossible case of Chuunibyo, namely Rikka. And shortly after 2-3 episodes I was already in love with the series. As far as the first episodes progress we mainly get to know the main characters better, and it is actually more comedy than there is romance. There is not too much to the story neither at first, as we mostly get to know more background of the main characters. Though if that is something which would keep you bored, fear not. The comedy is really decent and as you probably have discovered, the Chuunibyo disease (8th grader symptom) is already an original part in this anime which separates it from the mass. It is an ingenious idea and the author exploits it really well to create some great comedy which made me laugh out loud a lot. It is an idea that would not run out of quality even if this anime had been made into 24 episodes or more... which in fact, makes me very angry that it isn&#039;t. Also, if it is your preference, I can tell you that the animation is really great too. And the soundtrack makes up a lot of the series. But of course, this is not all there is to Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!. Remember, I am all about the plot.<br />
<br />
After a few episodes of getting used to the main characters, the anime switch much more focus unto Yuuta and especially Rikka. I must really say I love these two characters. Yuuta is the kind of person trying to fit in with the rest, trying to be normal and fit with the group. Though, he just cannot abandon Rikka even though she is embarrassing and acts wrong, which is the biggest reason I like Yuuta as a character. Of course, he plays a huge role in the comedy factor as he is the only reasonable person among Rikka and her Chuunibyo followers. Rikka too is the comical aspect of the series, trying to draw Yuuta in with her wild fantasies. At the same time she is also very cute, kind and a bit mystic. Though there is more reason to her Chuunibyo state than just age...<br />
<br />
As said, shortly after some episodes of getting to know the characters we get to the main story line which contains a lot of romance, but also a lot of drama. Yes, drama. How I love drama. Of course it is necessary to like the characters to create good drama. You could say the first episodes are preparation for it. We get to know Rikka&#039;s background a lot better as Yuuta finds out more about her. Her background contains a lot of drama and Yuuta tries his best to understand Rikka and help her in any way he can. Although he does a lot of mistakes and it is truly touching seeing how both the main characters grow together, understanding their faults, understanding what they feel and what the other feels. Too much of this would be spoilers, but it takes a truly dramatic turn and at the end of the anime I was deeply touched. What a great show! I had never expected it when I started watching the anime two days ago. Actually I was so caught up into it that I watched it all in one night, having to face the consequences on the next day. But it was just that good. I am considering if it was worth it though, since afterwards I have been feeling really depressed. Perhaps because I watched such great series all in one night and now there is no more episodes for me to see. Or maybe I am just saddened by my miserable life compared to how they live in the series. Why can&#039;t I have such a wonderful occurrence? Or maybe I fell in love with Rikka. Which of these it is, I do not know. But what I do know is that this anime became one of my top favorites and has refreshed my mind. It is truly a masterpiece for its genre, and I highly, dearly... more than recommend it.<br />

    What does it mean to be happy? Some people would tell you that being rich or famous is their ultimate dream. Now that could be true for a lot of people, but for me, however; self-acceptance is my one true wish.<br />
<br />
Growing up can be an awkward and intimidating process for some of us. I&#039;m sure that we have all done or said some things in the past that we look back on in regret or embarrassment, so when you get thrown into this cruel and unforgiving world where social norms are prevalent and people are very critical of you, the thought of having people finding

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294285">
        the dark secrets of your past could be very detrimental to yourself.<br />
<br />
I have spent most of my life slaving over each and every single little mistake I have made and forcing myself to act like everyone else in the hopes that people will finally accept me. Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! taught me that it is okay to be weird and different. That you don&#039;t need to be like everyone else in order to be happy. That loving yourself is the only thing you need to do in order to achieve happiness.<br />
<br />
Watching Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is like taking a trip to memory lane and reflecting on all the best moments that life has to offer when you&#039;re young and delusional. Rikka is kind of like the representation of your childhood while Yuuta reflects more of what adolescence is like and watching these two adorable goofballs talking to each other fills my heart with a warm feeling of nostalgia that I simply haven&#039;t felt before in anime.<br />
<br />
The cast of Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is one of the best that anime has to offer. Everybody here is a likeable dork and the character animation is always spot on and perfectly compliments the series&#039; sense of slapstick and over the top humor. You will often see these really detailed fight scenes where characters use huge swords or shoot magic stuff at each other, only to then cut to a scene showing the characters actually just lightly wailing on each other in the adorable KyoAni-fashion. Even if you can see a joke coming, the execution and delivery of it all is so delightful that it&#039;s impossible to not crack a big dumb smile. But while Dekomori, Nibutani and everybody <br />
else are also great characters in their own right; the bond between Rikka and Yuuta takes the cake here. Seeing Yuuta accepting his past in order to get closer to Rikka out of sheer love honestly gave me the inspiration to do the same with myself. After all, as long as you&#039;re not hurting anybody, why should you feel bad for who you truly are on the inside?<br />
<br />
Even the opening feels like it&#039;s trying to amplify the show&#039;s message of clashing personality types with its visuals. However, Mother&#039;s Basement already made a great video on this opening in his &quot;Top 5 BEST Kyoto Animation Anime Openings&quot; so I would recommend that you go watch that video instead because otherwise I would just repeat everything he said.<br />
<br />
Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is a very personal and important show to me. If I were to ever get trapped on a deserted island and I had to pick one anime that would be the only source of entertainment for the rest of my life, then Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! would be that anime. No other anime has made me as happy as this show has and I still cry tears of joy every time I even think about it.<br />
<br />
If you are somebody that has struggled with self-acceptance in the past, then I would highly recommend this show to you! Even if you didn&#039;t feel the same way I do, the show has such an unparalleled charm to it that it should make for an enjoyable experience nonetheless.

    The title suggests it to be a random anime, the beginning gives you the image of a random goofy comedy anime honestly i didn&#039;t expect much out of this anime but it all changed once i began watching this series.<br />
<br />
5 episodes into the series all this begins to change and the story becomes more emotional and heartwarming and at sometimes gives you a nostalgic feeling of how it felt like when we were kids.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chuunibyou&quot;, i looked up what it meant on Google and this was the answer that i found: <br />
<br />
&quot;A Japanese slang term which roughly translates to &quot;Middle School 2nd Year Syndrome&quot;. People with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review80296">
        chuunibyou either act like a know-it-all adult and look down on real ones, or believe they have special powers unlike others.<br />
<br />
This is a common stage in growth; for most people, it happens--you guessed it--around the 2nd year of middle school (Grade 8 in Japan). However, the problem is, there are some grown-ups who have this symptom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just looking up this meaning made me grin like from ear to ear you know why?<br />
Because it was something that most of us have experienced in our school lives, whether it be in a severe form of mimicking your favorite TV character or in a cooler form of trying to be a wannabe music artist and developing newer ways to look good like your idol. In any case when we remember this some of us just smile and think &quot;that was fun&quot; and some of us think &quot;i wish i had never done that, i just want to roll over and die&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now coming to the anime what does the above written extra info have to do with the anime?? EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
The entire series is about a boy named Yuuta Togashi who has overcome his chuunibyou and Rika Takanashi who is still going through it somehow. The two meet each other on the night before their 1st day of highschool only to meet in the same classroom. Rika contacts Yuuta and calls him Dark Flame Master (Yuuta&#039;s former alter ego) and tells him that she has a wicked eye which is responding to his dark aura and she wants to form a contract with him, this makes Yuuta embarassed but somehow the two become friends a nd are drwan to each other.<br />
<br />
Well that was the gist of the story of the anime but now we come to the main point that why should you watch this anime??<br />
<br />
well its simple............. Its amazing!<br />
<br />
When one looks at Yuuta&#039;s character he/she is reminded of their own phase of childhood imagination. The plot turns really do remind you of the points and realizations that made you stop with your imagination. <br />
This anime will get you in the heart, it will make you laugh, will make you emotional and remember your own childhood and bring back memories that seem like a distant dream, and make you wish you could be a child again.<br />
<br />
WATCH IT!!!!!!!!!!
