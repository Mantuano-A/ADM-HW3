    Before starting this review, I would just like to say that you CAN watch the other 2 movies after or before watching this. That is because they occur at the same timeline. The only difference being that each focuses on different couples.<br />
Here&#039;s the titles of the 2 movies<br />
Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai<br />
Suki ni Naru Sono Shunkan wo.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai<br />
<br />
10 cm. Such as short distance. And yet it is too much to close this gap between these 2 people. No matter what you try, distance in love is not something easily explained. Although the person you love may be right next to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266761">
        you, you somehow feel that he/she is out of reach, almost impossible to ever meet to get closer. And when that person is on the other side of the world, you feel like you could reach him/her no matter what, holding on to your feelings. This is what &#039;Itsudatte Bokura no Koi wa 10 cm Datta.&#039; explores, the distance between people both literally and metaphorically. It is probably the best part about this anime.<br />
<br />
The anime is pretty good in my opinion, unless you don&#039;t want something a bit cliched. But even if it is, there are some anime series which do better on other things than just uniqueness. This is one of them, I think.<br />
<br />
First of all, I wouldn&#039;t say the story is the best part about this work. I think it was a bit too simplistic. A boy and girl seem to have a good relationship together. A few obstacles appear and this affects their friendship. They try their best to fix things up. That&#039;s it. Nothing new about the story, this kind of story has already been explored in many other shows. If I was to pick something unique out of this, it&#039;s probably the male lead&#039;s hobby, which is film-making. Therefore I gave a 7.<br />
<br />
In terms of characters, this series focuses on 1 main couple. They&#039;re a very cute couple, whom I strongly wished to get more screen-time when I watched the other 2 movies. Other than the main couple there are other 2 pairs and we see some of their development too (and of course you would see them as well in the other 2 movies).<br />
<br />
Miou is a good character, she is very honest and kind (too kind at times). The scenes when she&#039;s shy were the ones that made me really like her, it&#039;s a cute part of her personality. However her lack of confidence has been a slight problem. Miou was a bit too sensitive to the news about Haruki&#039;s brother, blaming herself for the problem. Going a bit overboard there. It felt as if her weakness in perceiving certain things was deliberately made to be an obstacle in her relationship with Haruki, So I lowered the character score to 7.<br />
<br />
Haruki is a very likeable character who is presented as someone who enjoys film making a lot, and is friendly to everyone in his club. I really liked the part where he doubted himself, people can always have a time when they&#039;re not at their best and start to question their decisions. Maybe he&#039;s a bit too good at film-making...<br />
<br />
The art is really good, way above average I&#039;d say. Very bright colors are used to create a joyful atmosphere throughout. 10/10. However I was a bit disappointed by the movements, sometimes it really looked forced and repetitive. Of course the sound is good thanks to Honeyworks, both the OP and ED are great. 10.<br />
<br />
The merry atmosphere in the anime is something I must go over on. It&#039;s the best aspect of this anime, and I&#039;ve always seen ever since I watched the other movies. Whenever one or two of the characters are down, there is always someone who cheers them up or helps them out. It&#039;s a simple yet essential part of the anime, forming a good development and only strengthening their friendship.<br />
<br />
Overall, a 9 would be suitable. I&#039;m the type who gives higher scores than most people so... <br />

    This series was absolutely beautiful and I enjoyed the hell out of it from start to finish.<br />
<br />
This is an excellent example of a romance anime done right and was definitely one of my favourite animes of fall 2017.<br />
<br />
Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart is a good example of a normal high school romance with no extraordinary characteristics or tropes you normally see in these sorts of anime and it still managed to keep me engaged with the characters and their stories.<br />
<br />
The art style and music is fantastic perfectly syncing to the scenes and made them all the more powerful. I began looking forward

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266786">
        to watching the opening each week.<br />
<br />
Characters were lovable and funny to watch making me wanting to support them and bridge that 10cm gap between them. The series keeps referring to that gap which is a nice touch.<br />
<br />
The series is sadly only six episodes but is much better than most full series and was a great send off for 2017.  If you want a quick watch masterpiece this is the series for you.<br />
<br />
Final score:10/10<br />

    I was waiting for this anime to come out for a little while now. <br />
I just watched the first episode and i cannot describe how dischanted and disappointed i am.<br />
That is why what i&#039;m about to write would seem more of a rant than a review. Since i&#039;m not used to write any. <br />
I&#039;m also quite indecisive about if i should write a &quot;review&quot; about one episode i watched or just ignore this monstrosity altogether. But since this anime has apparently only 6 episodes. I&#039;d give myself the freedom to do so. Let&#039;s do this :<br />
<br />
Art : The art in this anime is quite decent.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263909">
        Although the characters look bland and typical. Scenery-wise the art looks fine, but the character design is appalling. <br />
<br />
Sound: The sound quality is mediocre. The voice actors sound a bit flat. But they seem to be doing a fair job.<br />
<br />
Character : Dull, bland, uninspired and utterly average... Every tedious cliché you could find in the book was assembled to form those banal 1D characters. Their interactions are quite boring as well. None of the introduced characters seemed interesting.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : There wasn&#039;t any enjoyment. I couldn&#039;t think of anything redeemable.<br />
<br />
Overall : This eyesore of an anime is not only below mediocre and arid. It&#039;s also a typical case of a cornball romcom gone bad. It&#039;s distasteful and trite.  <br />
I dare say it&#039;s worst than those god awful and deplorable ecchi-harems/otome game adaptations.<br />

    No matter what people might say, I personally like the HoneyWorks anime franchise. As of now, the story from their original music videos was adapted into two, hour-lenght movies, and this six episode series. The first movie focused on all of our three main couples, and I enjoyed it quite a lot. The second one was worse in comparison, the characters were especially weaker, but it still remained on the positive side of things. And now we have this. A short six episode series resolving around one of the main couples. Did it live up to the potential? For me, certainly yes.<br />
<br />
First question that comes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266774">
        to mind is, do you have to watch the movies to understand this series? Not really, it stays pretty independent from each other. But if you like romantic stories, there is no reason not to do so. It&#039;s a good watch.<br />
<br />
Anyway, let&#039;s get to the bussines. The story is centered around one of the couples from the first movie: Miou Aida and Haruki Serizawa. I called them a couple, which technically shouldn&#039;t be the case because they&#039;re not dating or anything yet, but that doesn&#039;t really matter. This is a straightforward romance. No love-triangle, just pure one on one. Which is a really good thing. Being a short anime, the decision to focus only on one couple is welcome and we get to see the story around them develop a lot during the time. <br />
<br />
Miou is a shy and a self-confidence lacking girl, that enjoys painting more than anything. It&#039;s her own way of forgetting her problems, and she is both more lively and cheerful when she&#039;s in an artist environment. While being shy when talking to other people, it&#039;s not done over the top. It is always hard to balance out the personality traits of characters, especially when they are so over-used as the confidence lacking characters are. Miou however, is a case of a well made one. She&#039;s more quiet, but has her own sweet and happy moments. She can do something you wouldn&#039;t expect from her. And despite her falling into depression at a certain point, her motives to do so are understandable and her recovery is a well-fought battle.<br />
<br />
Haruki seems, unlike Miou, as an outgoing and forward type of guy. He holds a passion for movie-making, around which the whole plot of the show evolves. Despite his first given impression, whenever he&#039;s alone with Miou, he tends to get nervous aswell, not having the guts to even hold her hand. The good thing on Haruki is that he&#039;s extremely realistic as far as his personality goes. I can see myself in him. And I think it&#039;s that touch of reality that makes him a good character, because if we were talking about the other things he does or doesn&#039;t, he&#039;s as straight-forward as it goes. Ya know, he&#039;s good-looking, outgoing, friendly and a &quot;leader of the gang&quot;. Despite all that, I still like him. Because the show did a really good job at showing both good and bad personality traits of both of our characters.<br />
<br />
The writing of the show in itself is something, I would like to talk about for a bit. You see, incase you don&#039;t know yet, this is a romance drama. And the word drama can also mean trouble, as the modern animes seem to find it harder and harder to do a proper, not over the top drama that fits the atmosphere well. Which is not the case this time around. It could be actually called the carrying point of this show. Starts of slow and nicely, then suddenly picks up the pace at both ends, and although the peak could be called maybe a little too dramatic, I think I would just be nitpicking at that moment. The setup is decent, the turn-around respectable and the resolution nearly fabulous. I do find the two main characters written well too. They are lacking a bit at certain times, but that just adds to the fact that this show does it&#039;s best at making them beliavable.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re familiar with this franchise, you also know that there are three main couples overall. That&#039;s true in the grand scheme of things, but the other two just play the supporting role in this one. Akari + Souta and Natsuki + Yuu. Considering how things went in the first movie, I think and I hope that they will both get their own short animes, like Miou and Haruki did. They deserve it. Atleast Akari with Souta do, I find the two to be destined for each other. Anyways, these four are written in about the same way as the two. Different personalities, but every one of them feels realistic with their behaving, especially in the romantic moments. And despite their romance being cut off this time, they still work well as a supportive cast acting like High School friends do.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, Itsudatte Boku- whatever 10 cm, is a quality show. And it&#039;s hell of a fun to watch. Despite not impressing me that much at the start, the show made me appreciate it&#039;s strong points and I wanted to see more and more every week. It&#039;s not as rememberable as I would like to, but to be honest, which school romance anime is? For me it&#039;s important that the show besides it&#039;s own selling points also had a big entertainment value. While it was seeing Miou and Haruki together or alone, I never started doubting their purpose in the show and I never got bored of them. Which can be said about their story aswell. Just a cherry on top of all things I&#039;ve said is a very well made ending, that warms your heart to the core.<br />
<br />
The general looks of this are really good. I always liked the desings of all the characters, which haven&#039;t changed since the movies. That stays the same and I still find it pleasant to look at. The animation feels on-point most of the time, despite not showing that many hard-effort scenes or moments.<br />
<br />
I loved the music of the movies. Both the vocal and ambient OST played a big role in them and I still find them very nice to listen to. That being said, no vocal songs aside from opening and ending were used in this one. Which is a shame in my opinion, as exactly these types of animes are the ones that would deserve it. The ambient OST stays almost the same, but felt a little less impactful than was before. Overall, despite the music taking a step back, it still be considered a huge plus when not comparing to the prequel movies. <br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Itsudatte Bokura no Koi wa 10 cm Datta is a great example of a show that focused on the things an anime of this genre should have. It presents a well made dramatic story with a respectable cast around it. And with the fair producion value qualities, I just can&#039;t do anything else but say: This anime was a pleasure to watch.

      You know what I hate more than entitled and obnoxious tsunderes? Totally insecure and dull female leads :P<br />
  To be frank, I&#039;d rate this anime for at least 3.5, given that the art and sound is kinda cool but story and characterization plays a lot on enjoyment, so you can see where exactly this story&#039;s fall down is.<br />
  When I&#039;ve actually watched the movie, Zutto Mae Kara Suki Deshita, I&#039;ve given it an average score because out of the three couples it presented (which already gave way that there will probably be less development and progress within both characters and story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review341591">
        line), I&#039;ve actually liked Haruki and Miou the most. LIKED. This series burned that little respect I had away.<br />
  There are a lot of things I found awfully wrong in the anime like: (1) Why are they all friends (like I understand at least why the guys were but the girls were kinda meh), (2) How the f did those two even fall in love with each other? (the two main leads who are completely incompatible), (3) How can they be so effin unrelatable? and honestly so much more but I&#039;m not writing a manuscript so I&#039;ll stick with my major problem with this anime- Miou Aida.<br />
  Miou Aida is a shy, caring, tender, and loving female lead who has captivated the attention of popular aspiring film director Haruki (our main lead) because apparently, standing under cherry blossoms makes you all the more interesting. Look, I can&#039;t even begin to explain why I don&#039;t like this character. I know the intention of Miou&#039;s character and all, but the way she was executed absolutely made me HATE her. Reading manga and watching anime for a while has made me numerously witness a writer&#039;s attempt to make a female lead lovable, which is usually done by introducing it as shy and kind and completely unassuming. Let me explain: I mean, no one likes arrogant characters, right? Writers usually attempt to make their main leads humble to make them more lovable but that doesn&#039;t always end up as the case as some writers overdo it, which results to dull and questionable characters like Miou. <br />
  Honestly, I don&#039;t even get why a lot of people like her character. I personally prefer the purple-haired girl, she was, what I would like to say, the perfect female lead (I really wished she was). She was understanding, confident, and has a complete stand. Look, I get that some people have their insecurities and cannot be confident but it wouldn&#039;t hurt for the girl to grow a backbone and actually own up to the compliments. How do I explain this exactly- imagine telling a model: &quot;Wow, you&#039;re so pretty&quot; and getting &quot;Oh no, I&#039;m not pretty, no.&quot; Makes you want to kick the model&#039;s face, huh? That is just one of my problems with Miou.<br />
  The friendship was okay, but it wasn&#039;t really that believable. I mean, if a friend of mine started jerking around with me and acted all cold with me and then even when I confront him/her says I&#039;m better off not talking to him/her then SCREW HIM/HER. That&#039;s kind of a jerk move, don&#039;t you think? And yet Miou is somehow blessed with this great people who babies her even if she&#039;s acting like a spoiled princess!<br />
  I also didn&#039;t like how they butchered Haruki&#039;s character. The boy was already fine as an ambitious aspiring film director but NO. Because Miou is going through drama after drama, somehow the writers thought that Haruki should too. I mean, the dream stuff at least was valid compared to my problem with the FL so I guess his character is a little developed than Miou? I don&#039;t know. Either way, they weren&#039;t really developed. But I&#039;ll give props to the writers for at least making the ML a little decent. OMG, imagine if both of them were overly dramatic! Grrrr-<br />
  The art and sounds were really good, especially the music. It is Honeyworks after all.<br />
  To quip, I actually expected a lot from this series because they were my favorite couple from the first movie but I guess now, I&#039;m questioning why the heck are they even still together? Like seriously, Haruki could do SO much better. I know I&#039;m being a little harsh but I&#039;ll take an arrogant tsundere over an insecure and completely boring FL. Like seriously, at least the former is a little empathetic than the latter. <br />
  Anyways, the story in my opinion was really dreadful compared to the two movies (which falls on average). Story and characters often falls in line and it would&#039;ve been great at least to get some character development but instead we get drama, drama, drama. It would&#039;ve been nice if they were at least relatable but to be honest, the only thing I found at least relatable was the dream conflict with Haruki, but even that was just a downgrade of his character but oh well. Judging from the first two movies, I probably shouldn&#039;t have expected a decent story out of this. How I even finished this anime is beyond me.<br />
<br />
[SPOILER ALERT!!]<br />
PS. I also dislike how the major conflict (this went for like majority of the episodes) is Miou running away from Haruki because his (deceased) brother saved her? Like dude, she even got advise from that sensei that it was alright and it was not her fault (which was completely correct) and that she should live happily now knowing this and what does she do? Shut Haruki out completely (making him question what he&#039;s done wrong and completely putting a lot of stress on his already stressed shoulders) and sulk about everything. Like if that isn&#039;t being self-centered I don&#039;t know what is.<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong, I know survivor&#039;s guilt and all but dude, AKI (HARUKI&#039;S OLDER BRO) DIED BECAUSE OF AN EFFING DISEASE AND NOT BECAUSE HE SAVED MIOU OR WHATEVER. It really made me want to throw my phone whenever she monologues that it was all her fault and owns up the problem or whatever. I just find it so wrong and so unnecessary and a waste of time. That thinking was actually just toxic, TBH.<br />
[END OF SPOILER]<br />
<br />
PSS.I should know because I actually got to experience being friends with a Miou somewhere in my horrible life and let me tell you, it was a scarring experience. If you ever meet a Miou, run away screaming :P

    This is one of those lil cute anime you find and keep watching , tbh it resembles the movie a lot with all the different and vivid colors used and having only 6 episodes (the movie was 1hr long).The overall story is more or less the same , some may call it cliche but it is a good and fun cliche (I mean it) and if you are wondering if you need to watch the movie prior to this I must say that although it would help a lot with the character development (movies main characters have supporting roles in here and vice versa) but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263947">
        it is not necessary as it has it&#039;s own story. The most unique aspects of the show is its being short and the eye catching art it has , I bet no one would get bored of it if it is this long which I think is a positive thing for an anime like this , the overall sounding is done pretty good too it won&#039;t tire you throughout the show and the OP and ED are both above average.<br />
If you&#039;re looking for something cute and casual that won&#039;t take much of your time and help you relax , this is the anime for you.

    3  - Solidity of story, Plot/ route/ event choosing<br />
(General score of overall story. How they managing, planning and creating the series. Whether the adaptation match the source material or even improve it)<br />
* Predictable, dull, uninspired, not attractive, bad writing, cringe like typical brainless teenager love.<br />
3  - Story/ Theme/ Genre exploration and utilising, Detail<br />
(Flow of the anime, how the anime turn from main premise/ type/ genre, Clearness/ mystery/ story telling)<br />
*  Its like usual &#039;forced irational drama&#039; like any drama tv, not attractive, not creative<br />
8  - Directing, Cinematography, Script, Choreography, Scene to scene, Camera perspective/ angle<br />
* Well i can say they know how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review270423">
        to make a &#039;film&#039;, its not that great tho, much cliche and not powerful scene<br />
4  - World building and atmosphere<br />
(How they describe, portray and presenting their world or setting. Realism/ fantasy aspect)<br />
* The main mc journey is feel flat and so easy. The school setting feel bland<br />
8 - Seriousness of production, Production quality, Consistency<br />
* Still have a flaw on it on consistency or quality<br />
6  - Execution power: Story, Content , Moral value, jokes<br />
(How the content of the anime delivered to audience)<br />
* Spoilers in OP ruin it, make me dont manage to completing this. The execution seems right, its already right to be a teen drama<br />
7  - Visual<br />
(Art quality, Animation quality, Art style and its suitability, Detail of scene, Background, Character design)<br />
* Its good, but the artstyle not that vivid as the previous movie<br />
6  - Audio<br />
(Voice actors, OST, Background music, Sound effect)<br />
* VA is irritating epecially the main female and male protagonist, audio quality seems right<br />
4  - Character and its impact<br />
* Irritating, irational, cliche, bland , not lovable<br />
4  - Enjoyment, Excitement, Satisfaction, Entertainment, Our feeling and experience to the anime<br />
*  The spoiler at the OP ruin it and make me hesitate to completing it, the plot seems stupid and predictable for me, all side character feel flat. So much cringe, not enough power in some scene<br />
<br />
Overall 5 (53)<br />
It could be your choice for teen drama, but i find it not attracting and predictable

    10 cm apart is probably one of my favorite romance series ever.... and i&#039;ve seen a lot of them. The characters are well designed and believable, but the true worth is in their interactions. They feel like genuine people trying to navigate high school relationships, that being said its not super in depth with the other characters besides the two main ones but it still holds up. The real reason I started this review was just so I can have it on record how much I absolutely ADORE the ED for this anime. Don&#039;t get me wrong the OP is ok, but the ending theme

          <span style="display: none;" id="review306338">
        is my favorite ED of all time, I literally cannot watch it without wanting to tear up. Please watch this even if its just to see what this amazing ed is.

    I think if I only talk about romance element then this is best. The feelings shown in this anime are 10 on 10. Art style was also satisfactory. This is not a solo series. You have to watch the two movies first , &#039;I have always liked you&#039; and &#039;The Moment you fall in love&#039;. But watching it solo is also okay. When I watched the movies I thought this is a average franchise but this season is just outstanding. One of my favourite anime seasons of all time. Better than most romance animes . I will recommend this to everyone who likes romance genre.

    Bland and Boring.<br />
<br />
Nothing new story wise as opposed to countless other similar works. But that could have been okay if the series didnt put so much forced focus on its name. &quot;Ohh no we are always 10 cm apart. even though we love each other we cant get close coz of plot reasons&quot;. Add in some past death drama and some teenage angst and you got yourself a wasted 3 hours of your life. <br />

Spoiler summary of story:<br />
guy and girl are in kiddy love. girl gets saved as a kid by guys&#039;s older brother, who later dies. girl finds out later on and is scared

    A short, touching romance, comedy, school drama that left me astonished and gruntled. Not gonna lie, although this series is short ( there&#039;s only 6 episodes ) it seems too underrated in my opinion. I conjecture that this anime deserves more attention due to its proficient and overwhelming aspects. <br />
<br />
Story : 7/10 <br />
<br />
The story focuses on two students, Miou Aida and Haruki Serizawa. Miou is a shy and reserved member of the school art club that prefers to stay out of the limelight whilst Haruki is the boisterous and confident ace of the movie club, already winning awards for his directing prowess. They both became

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308769">
        friends and grew closer to each other, but not until the last 10 centimeters. As time passes they had to decide their future and try to get past those last 10 centimeters. <br />
<br />
Well, I&#039;d say. The story has a great immense and everything connects together. Nonetheless, the romance is inadequately lacking. I&#039;m pretty much disappointed with the story adaptations especially the re-adaptation for episode 6. Don&#039;t know why the tarnation they did this, but I&#039;m very balked with this. It could&#039;ve been better, but noo.. <br />
<br />
Art : 8/10 <br />
<br />
&quot;If the art of an anime is a catastrophe, everything else sucks as well.&quot; is pretty much my judgement on every anime I reviewed. I only watch series that have acceptable art style, quality and good effects. Itsudatte Bokura no Koi wa 10 cm Datta has a reasonable art, and I&#039;d say it&#039;s pretty good for a studio that I never knew existed. <br />
<br />
Sound : 8/10<br />
<br />
The opening is appealing and I&#039;m planning to listen to it again sometimes. But, I totally overlook the ending as regular since it sounds like the average closure tune you get in every ( most ) anime. There&#039;s actually not a lot to state about the sound, the background sounds are alright, thus does the music. Despite the fact that I have an inclination that there are spaces for improvements.<br />
<br />
Character : 8/10 <br />
<br />
The development of the two main characters are so constraining. What&#039;s more, since this anime isn&#039;t a slice of life, there are likewise other supporting characters and I surmise they&#039;re having enough attention. But seriously, if this anime was a slice of life I think that it would&#039;ve been way better for an anime like this. <br />
<br />
Without a doubt, they may have made up at the end. Yet, it wasn&#039;t sufficient, all the weight built up inside the story merits a way better closure. This one is a &quot;meh&quot; which sort of baffles me because this anime has a lot of potential.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 8/10 <br />
<br />
I enjoyed watching this anime a lot, somewhat it nearly made me cry at the near end but it wasn&#039;t enough. Still, I had fun watching this short series and I&#039;d be willing to give it a high score because it seems too underrated.<br />
<br />
Overall : 9/10<br />
<br />
This score will probably change ( decrease ) as time passes, but for now. It will remain on the stairs towards a true masterpiece, and it won&#039;t get any higher because I don&#039;t think anything will change my mind. <br />

    &quot;The Colour of Love is that of Fireworks&quot;<br />
<br />
*Spoiler Free*<br />
The adaption of games is hard, and it&#039;g going to be harder if adapted from a vocaloid. The show introduces itself as a shoujo-like story, following two who are &quot;destined&quot; to meet, whilst this might seem a bit cliche, the foundation of the show is actually built consistently on and what you get in the end is a well constructed piece of work<br />
<br />
Story 7/10<br />
Whilst taking into consideration it&#039;s limited 6 episode, this show really epitomises how to create a good story in the space of a short time. Looking at only one couple from the Honeyworks confession

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266842">
        committee serie, it dives straight into the romantic aspect of how the couple feels, the simplicity of the show is it&#039;s strength and hence it drew out the potential of the show. This in my opinion is critical especially since the show is only half of that of an average series. For the better or worse the show will be extremely direct in terms of plot driving, but it helps drive the romance within the story.<br />
However I felt towards the last few episodes that the story was being held back, preventing the plot from moving on, hence proving to be an unsatisfactory point. Whats more is that although having the hardships of adapting a song, the characters did feel a bit cliche, something I will elaborate on in the character section. Another point is the predictable story, something that is prone to this kind of anime, in that the eventual said ending would be pretty easy to guess if one has been paying attention the whole way. But I digress, what I found more fascinating was the execution of the plot, it was very fluid and I felt that I could always understand what was going on, hence proving to be a strength in the story. Romance wise in terms of plot, made me feel more lonelier than I already am...<br />
 <br />
Art 8/10<br />
Lay-Duce did a pretty good job in terms of animation and art, nothing felt clunky and at times it looked as though the scenes were drawn by bigger companies like J.C or Kyoani. The landscape of the story was done very beautifully<br />
<br />
Sound 10/10<br />
You can&#039;t really complain about the sound and music since this was adapted from a vocaloid and the music was arranged by Honeyworks, I am 100% biased here but the music was perfect, the tone fit every aspect of the plot as it was an essential ingredient to the mood in every scene, a detail that cannot be looked over.<br />
<br />
Character 7/10<br />
The show focuses on a single couple, while trying to show that there are other characters from the cast of 6 in the story, however from the perspective of someone who has never read the original series, listened to the character songs or watched the 2 movies prior to the TV show, they would probably be lost wondering what the characters relations or motives may be. Despite not being a slice-of-life, I felt that it did not explore the school aspect of the said high school students enough, there and there it revealed how each student behaved in class and during break, but there was potential to elaborate on the other features of the school life. Furthermore as mentioned in the story section, I added that the characters seemed a bit cliche, with a shy heroine and a strong yet harbours a secret that weakens the character male lead, with this you can really predict what will eventually happen in the series especially with our said heroine. Nonetheless the character interactions within the plot is well done, and it is shown in the influential decisions that effectively result in character&#039;s reactions and emotions.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
As a fan of Honeyworks I was hyped from the moment the series was announced, and while this review may be unreliable, with 6 episodes it was a nice experience to enjoy a short series with not too much to think about<br />
<br />
Overall 8/10<br />
Itsudatte Bokura no koi wa 10cm datta is a high 8, Whilst music and Story was a high point for the show, I felt that it could&#039;ve been perfect if they nailed the characters for a better score, and also with a romantic school drama, it is expected that nothing mind blowing would be explored as the genre has already quite reached its limits. Nevertheless the show did very well for 6 episodes whilst competing with other shows in the middle of the Fall season of 2017

    Our Love is always 10 centimeters apart is a romance anime based on characters from a separate movie and other source material, I found this anime on Mal after browsing for good romance anime, I decided to give it a watch, and it was pretty decent, it&#039;s definitely  not one of the best romance anime tho like Sakurasou, Your Lie in April, Afterstory and all that, but it still looked interesting and had a pretty cool premise. It tells the story of a girl named Miou Aida and a boy named Haruki who have been in love since the first year of highschool one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349264">
        being a painter, the other being a movie director, despite their strong feelings towards each other and spending a lot of time together, their romance doesn&#039;t progress because they are both shy when it comes to confessing, plus they always end up with a 10 centimeter space away from each other. They enventually encounter a conflict that changes them, but overcomes it with the help of their friends who are also secretly in love with one another as well. The story was pretty decent and enjoyable, it also had a lot of memorable side characters that I really liked, especially Mr Akechi, that guy is a pretty good adviser for these troubled children. I did find a couple of flaws here that really hindered this animes quality for me. The first a minor one where they use basic troupes like the childhood friend etc for the sidecharacters, and I was expecting actual new unique characters, but oh well we get the troupes and cliches for characters once again. Next up is a big one how the characters are so stupid when it comes to making decisions, imma have to state spoilers from here on out so this is your warning, Aida is fucking stupid so is Haruki, Aida straights up thinks that Haruki will hate her because his dead brother saved her, despite his brother actually being a genuinely good person and seeing it as a massive accomplishment. She blames herself for her brothers death, even tho Haruki&#039;s brothers death was because of his frail body and fatal illness, feels like Kaori from your lie in april actually, might be the same disease,  since they both where bed ridden  and ended up dying there. In terms of Haruki, this man ends up in a conflict where he thinks he actually didn&#039;t have a dream and was just pretending to follow and reenact his brothers footsteps, despite him clearly being happy doing it, plus him meeting all this wonderful people that ended up changing his life for the better, seriously tho this guy is a freaking moron, like come on, why did this inner conflict even exist in the first place, is it only because we needed a conflict from the other main character, anime you could have done a much more better job than this.  The final flaw that pissed me off the most was the immaturity, while the concept was established to be how hard it is to state your feelings for the person you love while being young, according to my experiences it is the opposite, you both love each other just confess, if it doesn&#039;t work out move on its that simple, I&#039;m a person that has gone through a lot of relationships, I have had my heart broken many times over the fast years of my life, never once have I had the difficulty of confessing, the same went for my friends, while at first it was true, but it wasn&#039;t to the extend that it was last minute and almost just not possible anymore because of lack of time being in final school years and in fear of separating ways after graduation, seriously I was cringing while they make their decisions and go through the most avoidable problems, like I was screaming on the screen on what to do, and how it was perfectly normal to do it, guess what these characters do the exact opposite things like come on men. Anime could have been much more better if it weren&#039;t for these obvious awful flaws imo.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
-Great animation, stunning visuals<br />
-Good score<br />
-Banger OP, decent ED<br />
-Characters blend in well together , they have chemistry and it just made me love them, even the side characters actually felt like amazing people, despite the fact that they all act the same in terms of love.<br />
-Decent premise<br />
-Good Pacing<br />
<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
-Has some annoying flaws like immaturity to the maximum, seriously I have never seen nor expected people to be this immature, and also characters being stupid making idiotic decisions<br />
-Ending was predictable<br />
- I Wanted to see more from the other characters but I guess there&#039;s a movie and other source material for that, since apparently this is a series, now I don&#039;t know if imma continue on this probably not tho.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall Our love is always ten centimeters apart was a pretty decent romance anime, that had a cool concept but not executed properly leaving out some obvious and annoying writing flaws, it&#039;s a shame the anime would have been a lot bettter if the writers just used common sense and actually made better conflicts rather than just copping out to immaturity leads to idiotic decisions, a true shame for that this anime gets a 7/10 for my overall anime rating.

    When going into 10 centimeters I expected an anime that was going to be cliched just from the mere title: *Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart*. Having being raised with a Shoujo manga and anime beginning this isn&#039;t all that bad to me. Sometimes the most entertaining stories can be those that don&#039;t try to stray away from the norm.<br />
<br />
Itsudatekoi does a pretty good job at realizing what its strengths are and how to best hide its weaknesses. It&#039;s a short anime (6 episodes) that explores many of the existential crises that High School seniors go through before graduation. While this show&#039;s main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review269855">
        theme is romance, I would say it has a heavier focus on drama because by halfway through we can see the crises that start fostering within the minds of MCs Aida Miou and Haruki Serizawa.<br />
<br />
I want this to be spoiler free, so I won&#039;t talk about that plot point because each of those characters individual crises are showcased in episode 3 (Aida) and episode 4 (Haruki).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, due to the small amount of episodes, these dramatic elements lacked a sense of development. It hits the viewers like a truck and we can understand, at least relate, to their ongoing struggles. But, with the short-time frame, it hits hard and, almost, instantly settles itself. It was like the screenwriters only knew how to build tension, but not transfer that tension into various plot-points within the next couple of episodes. I am not blaming the screenwriters on this because I doubt even great directors like Hosoda or Takahata could have figured out how to properly funnel out all the the dramatic elements into 18 minutes without it feeling rushed or improperly finished. 1 or 2 more episodes would have been massively beneficial for this series.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the characters, all of them are easily relatable and fairly realistic. However, they are boring to watch. While I am normally for the trade-off between realism and enjoyment. I just found all the conversations and interactions between the characters to be mundane and lack any sort of progression. And no, a singular scene doesn&#039;t save the fact the characters were dry as licking paper.<br />
<br />
Do I believe Itsudattekoi is a bad anime? No. I think it&#039;s a fine anime with a lot of flaws stemming from its pacing issues, most likely due to its short run-time.<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this anime to someone? That is also very unlikely. There are better romance anime out there that explore these same concepts whether they are or are not in school. However, if you have the time and this is somewhat interesting to you, then you won&#039;t be disappointed because its not a bad anime. Just don&#039;t expect a top-tier experience.

    Ok, so here&#039;s my opinion:<br />
Let&#039;s be honest, we need an opinion of someone who has seen HoneyWorks ever since they started making this saga or, at least, started watching it and comprehended it.<br />
<br />
First of all, story:<br />
I&#039;m really pleased at all of this, Haruki is a guy who loves making movies as his passion and thanks to the influence of his brother, Chiaki. Miou is a girl who&#039;s not only shy, but brave when the moment catch her, she loves painting as a passion even though she categorizes it as a &quot;hobby&quot;. Both of them had already appeard in a lot of HoneyWorks PVs (including Hatsukoi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review267077">
        no Ehon, their story&#039;s PV) as well as in the past 2 movies: &quot;Zutto mae Kara suki Deshita&quot; and &quot;Suki ni naru sono Shunkan wo&quot;, so people may already had a hint they both liked each other, however, it is not necessary to lean on the movies to know their stories, but otherwise, compliment. Haruki and Miou have a really good relationship but never get to cross their own 10cm distance, that&#039;s where the title comes in action &quot;Our love has always been 10cm apart&quot; (clever, since the lyrics of Hatsukoi no Ehon touch the same words and topics)<br />
This series, not only cover and adapts cleverly the songs and manga we&#039;ve already seen, but also develops the story in its own with some thing we hadn&#039;t seen in anyways (like when Haruki got his own self-problem), however, a lot of songs were not covered and were a vital part of the story like Inokori Sensei and Hatsukoi no Ehon -another story- (which takes the song&#039;s same name into the point of view of Haruki) but aside of that, everything went nice and smoothly.<br />
<br />
STORY: 9/10<br />
<br />
Art<br />
Sincerely enough, Lay-duce made a better job than Aniplex with the art of the characters, making their characters less &quot;shiny&quot; and more plain (in a Lovely Complex style or Kimi ni Todoke), however, most of the scenes were made out poorly. comparated to Yamako&#039;s (Mogelatte and Rokuro as well) great work as an artist for Honeyworks&#039; PVs and Mangas. But, it went smoothly and felt really soft and shoujo-like, so, I&#039;m not really mad nor sad about it.<br />
<br />
ART: 8/10<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Perfect enough, I loved how they inteded in making songs with famous utaites like Amatsuki, and some character songs like Kiokemasuka, I&#039;m amased by the content of the albums the group already released (surprisingly enough, all songs appear in the anime except for Romeo which appeared in the latest Honeyworks movie). Another fact we can add is that they didn&#039;t use the Chico w/Honeyworks formula for the opening, instead, they used the in-universe idol group &quot;LIPxLIP&quot; with the song &quot;Nonfantasy&quot; sung by Kouki and Nobunaga. And, you may not know it, but I love when the seiyuus sing in-tone, and the ending felt perfect, it fitted enough for the anime (and the last episode&#039;s ending was amasing, a reconstruction of Hatsukoi no Ehon, in the point of view of Aida in the present [this is not counted in as a spoiler since it was announced way before and the song released the same day the anime went airing]). Simply, delightful.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 10/10<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
*EXPECT SPOILERS IN THIS PART, READ WITH CAUTION*<br />
Unlike the last 2 movies and the mangas, here we see a develop in character atmosphere, like Haruki after he realized he was only carrying out his brother&#039;s dream instead of his own, driving him crazy. Or Aida when she discovered about her savior, trying to escape from Haruki&#039;s wrong reaction. This is not the &quot;sugar sweet sweet&quot; couple people were expecting, no, this time, the characters had a deep connection with the background story, giving influence in their decisions. 6 episodes were enough to make my heart race and develop with Aida and Haruki, the best couple HoneyWorks could have (FUN FACT: They were planned to be the only couple in the Kokuhaku no Oto saga, but thanks to their PVs success, they expanded the whole saga universe)<br />
After everything that happened, they both changed in their adult ages, both of them grew up and knew how to get afront the &quot;10 cm&quot; that were keeping them away.<br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 10/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I TOTALLY ENJOYED THIS ANIME, I was waiting for it ever since they announced it, and totally fell in love with various soundtracs (even though some of the tracks are re-used from past movies). HoneyWorks&#039; fixed the errors they made with the movies, and made them look better, one thing for sure that I liked the most was the abscense of some characters like Hina, Kotaro and Sena. ¿The reason? Obviously enough, because of the focus this couple was getting (I&#039;m still proud of Gero because of his TV-anime debut as a seiyuu). I can&#039;t wait for HoneyWorks&#039; next proyect.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 10/10<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10

    Enjoyment: So, I already watched (and reviewed) the other 2 movies centered on this story and I feel like Goldilocks who finally found the &quot;just right&quot; porridge.<br />
<br />
Plot: I mentioned in another review that the plot would&#039;ve been better if the story was portrayed via episodes rather than a movies. Granted, the episodes add up to one long a** movie, but I feel this method of focusing solely on Miou and Haruki did some good. Of course the movie was a good definition of a cheesy teenage romance, yet it wasn&#039;t distasteful cheese. It was like an &quot;I&#039;m in the mood for this cheese&quot; cheesy. And

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266943">
        even for a tantalizing romance, the ending had its mature parts. Although the conflict was a bit too weak for my liking, I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything bad the viewers can&#039;t grasp from the trailer or name of the show<br />
<br />
Art:The art is once again beautiful and perfect for the setting and tone.<br />
<br />
Sound: The sound weren&#039;t bad. Nothing extraordinary about it.<br />
<br />
Character: I feel like the highlight of the show are the two protagonists and the fact that all of the other characters were finally in their rightful roles: barely-relevant supporting characters!!! There are many romance anime (and shows in general) that either only focus on one character or don&#039;t delve into the love birds&#039; personal stories at all. Both sides of the romance had backstories, goals, and hobbies, and the actual love story wasn&#039;t the sole focus. I got to know more about the characters which I felt made the love story more sell-able. I&#039;ve already said it on multiple accounts that I find some of the other characters rather cliche and/or annoying, but at least they weren&#039;t main characters and were shoved into a more secondary role.

    If you are just starting to get into romance anime and want a drama induced storyline, then this is the anime is for you. I think it&#039;s a good beginner anime for love story fanatics since it does not leave you expecting too much, but it&#039;s enough to get you hooked. <br />
To tell you the truth, I was not disappointed since I didn&#039;t expect much to begin with - only 6 episodes for character development in a coming of age story.  You can&#039;t get attached to these characters, so if you are looking for a quick fix this one is decent.  However, if

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326207">
        you are looking for depth, try Hachimitsu to Clover. Nevertheless, the story is an interesting one, but a bit overused. <br />
Art is lovely, but it&#039;s not astounding, it is as though it&#039;s missing something.

    Before I start I want to say that I haven&#039;t seen the two prequel movies that preceded this series, which have a more general focus on characters that appear in this anime. This series in particular focuses mainly on one of the couples that appear in the two films, and it isn&#039;t necessary to watch them before proceeding with this series. With that, I&#039;d like to come out and say that I think this anime has been slept on considerably; it&#039;s a cute little romance story that would definitely be appreciated by a lot of people who need their romance fix when they&#039;ve run out

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282329">
        of things to watch. It&#039;s a very straightforward shoujo-like plot that doesn&#039;t do much new, but goes through the usual conventions in a very beautiful and enjoyable way.<br />
<br />
One of the main reasons why I like this show is because it does exactly what people want to see out of a drama-romance anime; with it&#039;s short length (only 6 episodes), it forces the story forward without much in the way of pointless filler or storylines that don&#039;t correlate with the main narrative. This gives it great pacing in my opinion with the constraints given. However this was also a negative for me; the main story they chose to focus on was one about a character who was connected to both protagonists and impacted them personally in some way. This left it feeling like the anime wasn&#039;t about the main couple but rather about this character and how they deal with revelations about them that leave them wrapped up in doubt and frustration. And with the short amount of episodes, the anime couldn&#039;t further explore the couple&#039;s story beyond that. <br />
<br />
That being said, the anime does have a conclusive ending that was the one everyone was waiting to see, and it felt very gratifying. It also has superb animation and attractive character designs that are incredibly pleasing to look at, as well as a top-tier soundtrack. For a show that felt more like an OVA than a full series, it was a pleasant surprise. The two main characters, Haruki and Miou, were both likeable and had unique traits about them which made them stand out from usual romance protagonists as well as being very cute with each other. The anime also focuses on two side couples which are also likeable and enjoyable to see develop and eventually receive a conclusion.<br />
<br />
Itsudatte Bokura no Koi wa 10 cm Datta is a short and sweet little romance series that I think a lot of people have missed, and I think it&#039;s exactly what lovers of romance/shoujo anime are looking for. It does all the usual conventions of a love drama in a visually appealing and entertaining fashion but doesn&#039;t have much in the way of content, as it remains only 6 episodes long. While it is a cute love story that I overall recommend, in the end it did leave a little more to be desired.<br />

    This series disappoints me. Still, I appreciate the hard works done by the creator, kudos!<br />
<br />
It might be a good and entertaining series when I watched the first episodes, remembering that, actually, I had no high expectation toward romance anime at all (I even enjoy the common romance anime-template to the fullest) <br />
<br />
Nevertheless, the main character (girl main character) is that bad in my opinion. I know that every MC need to struggle certain shortage, but I this one is tooooo  mello-drama, weak-hearted,  effortless, anything to the unnecessary level. She doesn&#039;t have the sparks needed by an MC and I directly hate her on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339727">
        the first sight. Her character ruin the whole show for me personally. <br />
<br />
This review may be too personal and subjective so I&#039;m sorry for the inconvenience. <br />

&quot;The best moment, one scene, one cut. A movie a compilation of them&quot;<br />
<br />
This series wasn&#039;t one good moment, it was a series of meaningful moments strung together from start to end, like a compilation.<br />
<br />
Itsudatte Bokura no Koi wa 10 cm Datta; well that was mouthful. As it&#039;s English name is Our love has always been 10 centimetres apart, so I&#039;m gonna call it &quot;Our love&quot; from now on.<br />
Wanted to start by saying that I have NOT seen the other two movies, so my review is as a fresh pair of eyes to the franchise.<br />
<br />
For those of you wondering the movies are:<br />

<br />
The anime was a cute 6 episode series which told a romance story I really enjoyed. It is not a spectacular or an innovative breakthrough to the romance genre, but is a story worth watching and enjoying.<br />
<br />
Breakdown;<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed watching this story progress, for both the main characters and those around them. It was something slightly different to other things I&#039;ve seen and the ending was well presented in my opinion.<br />
Also worth saying that 6 episodes is around 144 minutes, which is much longer than the films. For that I&#039;m glad because it didn&#039;t feel rushed.<br />
With a good first episode and good ending, this story was one that I appreciate for sure.<br />
<br />
Art:9<br />
<br />
Nice and easy on the eyes. At times colours felt a bit grey, but still looks sharp.<br />
<br />
Sound:7<br />
<br />
Some great songs.. but not so great timing. I thought the opening and ending were strong though, especially with how the song complimented the video to reflect the characters.<br />
<br />
Characters:8<br />
<br />
A fun group of main and side characters. I think the amount of screen time given to all characters were well balanced, so it is easy to see your favourite character. However, none of the characters were unique or inventive. They were fun for the time of watching, but forgettable afterwards. Also I felt like two characters looked way too similar (sure they were related, but it was unrealistic). This may have been for affect but it became distracting at times.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:8<br />
<br />
Easy to watch and the drama sure built tension that got me excited. All moments had meaning so there was never a reason not to enjoy. That said &quot;Our love&quot; doesn&#039;t have the &quot;it&quot; factor that to make it a 10/10 enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
<br />
All this said, my review is only from this series. I assume that after watching the films, my thoughts may differ. For now though, &quot;Our Love&quot; has been a cute romance, with sweet moments to make me smile.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;ve got some spare moments I recommend watching.<br />
