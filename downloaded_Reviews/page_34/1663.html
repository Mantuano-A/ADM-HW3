    The past couple years haven&#039;t been so great for KyoAni. It&#039;s hard to deny that they&#039;ve lost the influence and momentum they had back in the mid-to-late 2000&#039;s, and their work as of late has largely ranged from mediocrity to the flat-out bad (yes, I&#039;m looking at Kyoukai no Kanata). Most of these issues can be attributed to their weakness in writing drama, which, thankfully, is nearly non-existent in their most recent series, Amaburi. <br />
<br />
Amaburi (officially &quot;Amagi Brilliant Park&quot;, which doesn&#039;t roll off the tongue nearly as well) sticks instead to KyoAni&#039;s strengths. While it&#039;s lacking in drama and shirtless bishounens, as a light-hearted slice-of-life

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178259">
        about a group of idiots managing an amusement park, it&#039;s well worth a watch. It also has Isuzu, who is maybe, just maybe, one of the most attractive heroines in anime, if hot anime ladies is your sort of thing. <br />
<br />
That said, anyone potentially interested in the show should be warned that the first episode is by far the worst. In it, the busty heroine (Isuzu) drags the cynical protagonist (Kanie) to the dilapidated amusement park that she manages, in the hopes that the former child actor, who, by the way, has absolutely zero experience in business management, will save the park from ruin. He begrudgingly accepts the offer, of course, and vows to meet the 500,000-visitors-in-four-months deadline so that the park will not be closed. At the end of the episode, Kanie also receives an abrupt kiss and a random superpower (which is not shown or mentioned again until several episodes later), because, uh, reasons?<br />
<br />
Tell me if this sounds at all familiar, because I&#039;ve seen hundreds of anime which have started off in the exact same way. I almost dropped Amaburi right there, and I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t, as it quickly shows it has little interest in being a serious story. Instead, it treats alcoholic, talking animals and magical powers as being completely ordinary. There&#039;s even a group of pirate walruses and a bloody dragon. Amaburi fully embraces its silly fantasy setting and cares not for realism. <br />
<br />
But a cost of this silliness is that the show spends more time on the animals and park mascots than it does the human characters. And the mascots (who wear their costumes so frequently that they must be fused to their body) are nowhere near as interesting as Kanie or Isuzu, considering that many of them are based on a single trope. There&#039;s an otaku masquerading as some sort of squirrel-thing, an easily-angered shark who turns into a hell-demon when doused in water, a sheep who acts like a street thug, and so on and so forth. Sure, these characters add a great deal of energy to the show and make the park feel more alive, but after their second or third appearance, it&#039;s not likely you will appreciate their presence all too much. A few of them even show up dozens of times, and by that point it feels like the show is stretching its jokes way too thin. Granted, though, the commercial scene in the final episode is pretty damn hilarious.<br />
<br />
Moffle is perhaps the one mascot who is treated as an actual character and not a running gag. He is introduced as some sort of asshole who punches his own customers when they throw a few bad words his way, and really, he&#039;s just an unlikeable jerk towards Kanie until the two start to accept each other&#039;s existence. But the reason he is a jerk makes sense: he doesn&#039;t want ruffians and other undesirables bringing danger to the park&#039;s princess, Latifa, so he plays the role of the jerk in order to protect her. It&#039;s hard not to warm up to the little guy by the end of the series. <br />
<br />
As for Latifa, she just sort of... exists. Latifa and the park are the two main focuses of the story, except she&#039;s absent in everything that occurs in the park and is only ever relevant in the first and final episodes. She&#039;s there solely as a catalyst for drama, which means her scenes are, unsurprisingly, the weakest in the show. At least she stands there and looks pretty sometimes, I guess? <br />
<br />
Kanie and Isuzu are far more interesting. On the surface, they&#039;re both very typical KyoAni characters (the Kyon-like protagonist who sighs and reluctantly does everything, and the big-breasted kuudere prone to hurting things), but there is at least a little bit of depth to their character. Kanie&#039;s reasons for quitting his role as a child actor is explained in one short scene, and so too is Isuzu&#039;s reason for constantly shooting people with her musket (though why a minor can legally carry a gun to school remains a mystery). The scene where their past is explained is actually handled with a surprising amount of maturity: there&#039;s no screaming and crying, no childhood trauma-- the two just accept it and move on with their lives as people normally would. <br />
<br />
However, the fact that the two are high school kids and yet somehow able to run a massive multi-million dollar business on their own is inexcusable nonsense. I&#039;m sorry, but 16-year-olds are nowhere near experienced enough to tackle such a huge responsibility. This is especially evident when Kanie makes asinine decisions like charging only 30yen (equivalent to 30 cents) for park admission, with all the rides being free of charge, as if this wouldn&#039;t immediately drive the park to ruin with an insurmountable amount of debt. Isuzu also occasionally shows up wearing an office lady outfit, and I couldn&#039;t help but groan every single time. If you want to write adult characters then, please, just bloody write them. It&#039;s not like it&#039;s particularly difficult to make the characters a few years older-- say, 19 or 20-- rather than forcing them to be high school students when it makes absolutely zero sense in the context of the story. It&#039;s like KyoAni is deathly afraid of writing characters past the age of seventeen (perhaps they think their fans will set fire to their studio if they dare try). I&#039;m getting very tired of it. The world does exist outside the confines of high school. <br />
<br />
The art is about what you would expect from any KyoAni anime, which is to say that it looks great. The sound is much more noteworthy as it is what gives the show the majority of its energy. There&#039;s a ton of classy jazz music playing in the background, and the OP is the sort of thing that will get stuck in your brain immediately after hearing it for the first time. I spent a few of my college classes with &quot;MAGIC HEART&quot; screaming in my head and it was both delightful and horrifying. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s hard to get rid of the feeling that Amaburi is one long prologue to what will probably be a second season. There&#039;s subtle hints of romance between Kanie and Isuzu-- the kind that KyoAni loves to expand upon-- and the story abruptly ends with a light-hearted episode that would normally have been stuck in as an OVA. There&#039;s a lot of potential for the second season to be superior to the first, and if KyoAni doesn&#039;t create one I would be very surprised. And perhaps a little disappointed. <br />
<br />
Amaburi is best approached with minimal expectations. If you&#039;re expecting another big hit from KyoAni, then Amaburi is certainly not going to be that. If you&#039;re OK with just having a few laughs at silly nonsense (and if you&#039;re a guy, a few erections from Isuzu&#039;s scenes), then you&#039;ll probably enjoy your time with the show. It&#039;s not a great anime, perhaps not even a good one, but there&#039;s more than enough enjoyable content in here to warrant a watch. If nothing else, at least it&#039;s not Kyoukai no Kanata.

    Amagi Brilliant Park has been making waves in the anime community this season, and it&#039;s easy to see why. An intriguingly goofy premise coupled with the fact that it&#039;s a Kyoto Animation production sets up rather high expectations. And I have to say, Amagi Brilliant Park exceeded my expectations in nearly every way.<br />
<br />
To say that Amaburi is absurd would be an understatement. Kanie Seiya, a high school student, is tasked with reviving a failing amusement park and has three months to reach its yearly quota of 500,000 guests or the park will shut down. Also, this park is inhabited by magical beings from a different

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175495">
        realm who rely on the fun that visitors have for their livelihood. Add the fact that the two lead characters are named after Kanye West and 50 Cent--how can you resist?<br />
<br />
Amaburi does well with its plot, but that&#039;s not where its true strength lies. At its core, Amaburi is built on its characters. Absurd, zany, and above all, lovable, the ensemble of characters contained within the park will win you over instantly. I&#039;m amazed at how much character development they managed to fit into 13 episodes (12 really--the last episode is just a filler). Amaburi really makes you feel the characters&#039; emotions and their motivation to keep their park open. It&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve been this engaged by a show&#039;s characters alone. The hilarious trio of mascots, the dysfunctional dance group, Sento&#039;s insecurities despite her stoic appearance, and an arrogant, narcissistic, but ultimately big-hearted main character, as well as a plethora of other wild characters leave a lasting impact.<br />
<br />
Huge props to the art direction team on this one. Amaburi looks absolutely stunning. The various areas of the park are bright and colorful, the characters are dynamic, and Amaburi features some of the most hysterical facial expressions I&#039;ve ever seen. A great job is done with character designs (whoever designed Sento, I cannot thank you enough--you have done humanity a great favor). Appearances aren&#039;t everything, but in this department Amaburi sure has it all.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I hardly have anything negative to say at all regarding this series. A great job of managing pacing gives it a full, complete feel despite its short length. By the story&#039;s conclusion, it&#039;s clear that Amagi Brilliant Park is more than just a goofy comedy. It&#039;s about more than just a high school kid running a magical theme park. It evokes feelings of community, friendship, and overcoming adversity that, while they may be corny, ring loud and true. Amagi Brilliant Park is far more heartwarming than its premise suggests. This is the feel-good show of the year.<br />

    LOOK AT THE SKY IT&#039;S MAGIC HOUR.<br />
Actually, it&#039;s half an hour in one episode, but you&#039;ll get the joke soon.<br />
<br />
Amagi Brilliant Park is just spectacular. Some of the audience loved it, and I think it&#039;s a chance that Kyoto Animation (KyoAni) has actually redeemed themselves over the troubles they had over the past year. Watching the first episode got me hooked since it has an interesting setting to look forward. You surely have seen amusement parks in a lot of anime, but that&#039;s just depicting the characters&#039; enjoyment. But, I&#039;m sure you have yet to see behind the scenes of the park&#039;s operation.<br />
<br />
The story starts

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175007">
        with Sento inviting Kanie to go with her to an unknown location which is Amagi Brilliant Park. Kanie wasn&#039;t pleased with the tour from Sento of the amusement park which is bad in shape and unsatisfactory. Later on, Sento introduced Latifa who then wants Kanie to become the next manager of the park and save it from being taken away. Also, this amusement park isn&#039;t just any ordinary park. Kanie learnt that it is occupied by &#039;fairies&#039; from Maple Land, a magical place far from reality.<br />
<br />
Before you are worried about KyoAni&#039;s antics, don&#039;t worry. To spoil a bit about the story, it wasn&#039;t written in a way which later it is plagued with problematic tropes. Basically throughout the whole anime, you see how Kanie is able to handle the park as the manager. He gets to learn more about the park, its attractions and the workers along the way and from there, he finds ways to improve the well-being. The anime is mostly comedic, meaning lots of moments to laugh at from episode to episode. I would say that it wasn&#039;t repetitive, making those moments unique in a sense. There are some dramatic moments which honestly, I feel that they are a bit forced and out of place from the prominent hilarious comedy. But not to fret, they don&#039;t really mess up the story much, since then the characters involved got back to their feet. There are also undeveloped romance in some relationships, but it&#039;s sweet to see some hints coming about.<br />
What I absolutely love about the story is how the park manages to develop, thanks to Kanie&#039;s direction as a manager. The workers might be negative over his choices of attracting visitors to the park, and you may be astonished too, but he managed them. The story may also not show this result, but it also drop hints too. Overall, I think the story was almost original and doesn&#039;t not have a lot of faults. Of course, many more topics in the story can be expanded, but out of thirteen episodes, I think it&#039;s a job well done for the script-writers. There is also some fan-service included that doesn&#039;t exceed too much, but you know, it&#039;s quite astonishing for KyoAni to add some. Sure, Free! is another anime with a lot of fan-service, but ignoring that anime, it is still a nice shock.<br />
<br />
The anime has a huge cast which is quite diverse in terms of personality. How the story introduces the characters one by one is fine, since Kanie meets a few workers in the park from episode to episode. Some of the characters have a small story behind them. But what is really good about the cast is that they are never forgotten. Once they are introduced, they will eventually pop up in the next episodes. So if you have your favourite character inside, don&#039;t feel left out.<br />
<br />
Of course, the story do focus on some of the characters. While Kanie manages the park, Sento assists him in some ways. There is some development between the two, but not very much to the point it gets romantic. Indeed, both of them have their own faults which can cause hilarity or not, given the situation they face. They are definitely different on each other in attitude-wise, but they understand each other. However, Latifah doesn&#039;t feel like as a main character but more of a plot device to make the story more dramatic. Not much interaction is seen from her, even many of the characters that don&#039;t have a larger role get more air time than her. Also, there&#039;s the three mascots, Moffle, Macaron and Tiramie, and the four Elementario fairies, Muse, Sylphy, Kobori and Salama. While the mascots serve more as a comedy piece of the story, the Elementario fairies get more development and story. It isn&#039;t really consistent but there&#039;s one episode that show more about themselves and it&#039;s great.<br />
<br />
Overall, the development is okay but not too great. More can be shown not only to Kanie and Sento alone, but also to Latifah and the rest. But given the thirteen-episode limit, it couldn&#039;t be helped anyway.<br />
<br />
Knowing KyoAni&#039;s anime already, I shouldn&#039;t be disappointed by its pleasing art style for this anime. The sceneries were definitely eye-grabbing, along with the details in them, the vibrant colours chosen and the lively atmosphere portrayed by the background characters. There are a lot of visual effects shown which are great, such as magical sparkles or the rustling of leaves. You&#039;ve already seen it quite a lot if you watched a lot of KyoAni anime, so it shouldn&#039;t really be a surprise, yet it is so awesome. The character designs were not really original, given that the face styles are similar to other characters from KyoAni&#039;s anime. But they are detailed and nice-looking. Some of the non-human designs are definitely cool for some, wacky for the rest. The facial expressions are well-done, and I definitely love the cartoon-ish ones to express hilarity.<br />

The opening song, sang by AKINO with her band, has won the hearts of many with the catchy beats and groovy tunes. It&#039;s easily one of the best songs heard in this season, since it attracted a lot of attention. See that starting quote? That&#039;s the first quote in the lyrics. It&#039;s too famous indeed. I actually looped the song many times. It has a nice feel that relates to the context of the story, giving the hype for the story and the lively feel in it. The ending song is different-sounding. Sang by the voice actresses of the Elementario fairies, it is supposed to have a more calm approach. You may feel that it doesn&#039;t really match the context, but you&#039;ll get used to it. If I put it aside, it&#039;s not a bad song and it&#039;s nice. The background music is not really noticeable, but I quite like the style of it. The OST album has been released, and a quick run-through has got me interested. The voice acting is great too. Some voice actors are well-known, the rest are either new or does not have many roles.<br />
<br />
Overall, I really loved the anime so much. Ignoring what has been giving the negative impressions of the anime, it&#039;s pretty much one of the best anime I&#039;ve watched this season. A seemingly-interesting story and a diverse cast will not disappoint you definitely. To summarise this anime, it has great comedy from the characters and a good development of the park, thanks to a narcissist manager and an emotionless assistant. Of course, the thirteen episode feels more like an OVA than an actual episode. It still continues from the previous episode indeed, but honestly they can just stop airing at the twelfth episode.

    Once every season, Kyoto Animation shows up and grabs the immediate attention of the entire otaku populous after announcing whatever they&#039;ve been up to the past few months. Being one of the biggest and most successful animation companies in Japan, people tend to automatically just chalk down whatever they license and eagerly await it, expecting something great. But does KyoAni succeed with their latest addition, Amagi Brilliant Park? Can they truly amount to more than just their wonderfully crafted artwork?<br />
<br />
Amagi Brilliant Park (Or Amaburi for short) follows Kanie Seiya, a narcissistic and self-centered (Wait. Kanie...Kanye...I see what you did there, KyoAni) high school student and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175461">
        former child-star, as he is recruited as the new manager for a failing theme park. However, this theme park is currently owned and operated by a group of people that come from the magical world of &quot;Maple Land&quot;. The women are beautiful and the males all look like mascots for college football teams, which is personally my ideal picture of a magic kingdom.<br />
<br />
Even though the story seems a little odd, it does quickly become alluring when you find out the princess of Maple Land and former manager of the park has a sickness that prevents her from aging and resets her memory once every year. And so Kanye West Seiya must bring in a total of 500,000 visitors in a six month period in order for the Maple Landers to keep the park. If he does not succeed, Princess Frailty will lose her magic powers contained within the park and ultimately die a tragic death.<br />
<br />
Amagi Brilliant Park has its ups and downs (LIKE A ROLLER COASTER. HA) but it isn&#039;t by any means bad. I found myself looking forward to it every week, just as I normally do with Kyoto Animation&#039;s stuff. But this time I didn&#039;t have to fully invest myself in the story like I had to do with sthows like Hyouka, which worked on solving mysteries and building up relationships. So, lets delve deeper as I once again break this show apart, piece by piece, to better illustrate how I feel about it.<br />
<br />
Music: 7/10<br />
Just like every other normal person in the world, I love clapping. The opening song to Amagi Brilliant Park utilizes clapping. Twice. That&#039;s cool, I like that. And since Kyoto Animation created the opening, the clapping looks sweet. But I digress. The anime sounds just like you&#039;d expect a show about a theme park to sound. The music is lively and cheerful, and at the same time it delivers hope. And with Amaburi&#039;s story, that is absolutely vital. Background music isn&#039;t repetitious at all and plays an essential part in making each scene seem full. But because the music wasn&#039;t outstanding and didn&#039;t play a part in changing the way people viewed the show, it wasn&#039;t perfect and definitely could have been improved upon.<br />
<br />
Characters: 9/10<br />
As far as characters go, Amaburi has a solid line-up. Kanie is quite different from the dense male leads you&#039;ll often find in anime today, and the rest of the cast is pretty solid as well. Sento Isuzu (Whose name I just found out comes from 50 Cent) does a great job in supporting Kanie&#039;s character throughout the duration of the show. And all of the mascot-men are there with extremely strong personalities to provide sufficient comic relief for the theme park. The thing is, even though the characters were very original and unique all across the board, the majority of them were ONLY there to serve as that comic relief I mentioned. It&#039;s great to be funny, but if that&#039;s your only personality trait in real life, you&#039;re probably going to have a hard time and you aren&#039;t a perfect character. I would have liked to see some more development in anyone apart from the leads, but it just didn&#039;t happen.<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
This was probably a given as soon as Kyoto Animation&#039;s name was put under the title, but Amagi Brilliant Park delivers some of the best artwork this year. Character designs were outrageous and easily memorable, and the theme park as a whole, even when it was decaying, was a sight for sore eyes. It&#039;s refreshing to see KyoAni constantly improving and not just taking advantage of their position in the industry and settling down in a &quot;safe spot&quot;. They are constantly pushing themselves to create something better, and it has been succeeding. As a reference point, please direct your attention to the Ferris wheel above. Isn&#039;t that the best damn Ferris wheel you&#039;ve ever seen in an anime? You&#039;re damn right it is. Amaburi has zero issues when it comes to appearance, and that is vital in keeping the audience&#039;s interest locked in.<br />
<br />
Story: 6/10 <br />
What&#039;s disappointing about the story line of this show is that they throw in a lot of information that seems like it&#039;s important, but is never mentioned again. The viewers never find out what exactly happened to cause Kanie&#039;s fallout of the entertainment industry. Sento&#039;s affections never get let out and ultimately become meaningless when you look at the bigger picture. And then Kanie goes off on this rant about how he is terrified of heights and wants to hide it from everyone but it plays no part in determining how you look at the story. And then there was the whole thing with how Kanie somehow ran into the princess when he was a child and now felt like he was destined to save her life. It just started to seem forced, like the writers wanted there to be a story when in all actuality the show was just there to be fun. The idea was good, but countless attempts to make it deeper than it should have been really ruined its legitimacy.<br />
<br />
Amagi Brilliant Park is a solid show, but it could have been much better. You&#039;ll find that the driving force in bringing you back to the next episode falls completely on the characters and artwork. It&#039;s definitely enjoyable, but one of the weaker shows KyoAni has brought forth in recent years, which may be a direct result of them setting the bar too high for themselves. Watch this if you are either an avid fan of the studio or just looking to have a few laughs and wind down. There are better options out there, but Amaburi will suffice if you don&#039;t want to look for them.

    What exactly is Amagi Brilliant Park? On the basic surface, it isn’t exactly brilliant with its host of generic characters. However, taking a closer glance at the show might make you think differently once you’re on board with its ideas. Don’t get me wrong though. Amagi Brilliant Park isn’t exactly a show for everyone but it does launches itself into a realm of its own that has a unique ability to keep the audience at their seats.<br />
<br />
Adapted by the light novel of the same name, this anime series covers the first book with a bit of expansion. There are also several interesting noteworthy attributes to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review174295">
        take into consideration about this adaptation. First, the series is written by Shoji Gatoh who is well known for his work, Full Metal Panic. Then, there’s the studio in charge known as Kyoto Animation. While the studio needs little introduction, one should take notice a history of its works and realize this show is one of the first they’ve done relating to such a gimmick. Rather than taking place in some school setting, the series take place in a place of modern fantasy known as the Amagi Brilliant Park.<br />
<br />
A fresh concept. This show can seem a bit strange at times. The first episode blasts off without wasting any time by introducing the two main protagonists – Seiya Kanie and Isuzu Sento. The oddball circumstance involves Sento going on a ‘date’ with Kanie but only then does he realize that their fun time turns into something else. As such, the show initially introduces the basic mechanics of Amagi Brilliant Park. It establishes the premise and lets the audience know what it’s about, a task done quite well with the mechanics. But when it comes to characters, the show swings in a bit of an odd direction. For instance, it’s easy to tell that Kanie and Sento are quite different. Kanie has a narcissist attitude with a full of confidence and pride. While on the other hand, Sento is much more stoic who shows little emotions despite her sensitive personality. When you put these two characters together as the main duo, there’s a problem with compatibility. Nonetheless, the show does seize opportunities to bring the best out of them. <br />
<br />
It does this often by appealing at the ideas of the show. To do this, almost every character that Kanie or Sento gets involved with plays a form of role in bringing in new customers. Because let’s face it, the goal of the series is to attract 250,000 visitors to the park and if not done in 3 months will lead to closure. The show makes it clear that if the park closes, then it would seize to exist at all (literally) in the human world. This is because of the staff of the park is made of beings from another realm known as the Maple World. And for the park to function, it needs to harvest magical energy from visitors who are having fun. Simply put: no visitors, no energy, no park. The show also makes it clear that Kanie has experience in the entertainment industry early on thanks to flashbacks and his own experiences. As such, expect Kanie to bring in ideas from what he has learned to ensure that Amagi Brilliant Park reaches its goal. <br />
<br />
As a show with many possibilities, most of it consists of the characters. There’s a wide diversity of them whether it’s a princess like Latifah Fleuranza, fairy mascots such as Moffle, the Elementario girls, or other members hired by the staff. The series gives them a variety of roles although their key purpose is to bring entertainment so that visitors come by. To say the least though, the show accomplishes its task of entertainment with the personalities of the characters. Almost all of them brings in some form of fun to the series even when timings feel off or the amount of generic concepts used. It also seems as if the show is self-aware at times because even some of the character names are originated from popular icons from the real life world. The key element to take into consideration is still entertainment as the show tries a different set of dynamics each episode. These involve the different attractions at the park such as Indiana Jones style adventures, Water Park (complete with pirates and the ship), trials and error with idol themes, or secret cave with a mythic dragon. There are still repetitive gimmicks used though such as Moffle’s fury (which is resulted from his endless rivalry with Kanie), Sento’s gun (that often strikes fear into almost anyone that comes near it including Kanie), or the variety of species used to bring in diversity. As such, a show such as this offers almost something for anyone when it comes to the characters. Unfortunately, characterization suffers and in fact almost non-existent. Except perhaps the princess, Sento, or Kanie, none of the other characters get background stories or development. It also seems like the show plays off of stereotypes and make certain characters (ex. Elementario girls) seem like a joke with little more than pure eye candy.<br />
<br />
Despite being written by the author of FMP, don’t expect much similarities to it. There’s no psychological scenarios or plots about the military. Instead, see this series like a showbiz. And to deliver that, the show needs to inspire comedy. While I think the series is on the right track, it occasionally tries far too hard to appeal in such a way at times. Comedy is repetitive and feels slipping away at times. There are some serious moments but some of the awkward timings feels off. However, a few of the characters are memorable for their personalities especially Kanie during key moments. One of his earlier speeches shows exactly the type of person he is despite putting on his poker face. While starving for ideas, the show does also finds ways to create opportunities to explore every aspect of its attractions through either internal or external conflict. These even include hiring new staff members, dealing with the past, and even events outside of the park. However, the endgame could be a mixed bag because like I mentioned before, this series is not for everyone. The finale of the episode also feels OVA-ish.<br />
<br />
When it comes to visuals, Amagi Brilliant Park’s technical quality nails it with its high production values thanks to Kyoto Animation. While landscapes aren’t lavishly on Makoto Shinkai levels, it does have creativity ideas behind it. However, the character designs feels childish. In particular, the mascots looks like furry animals while the Elementario girls almost gives off the feeling that they are teenagers on the way to a Halloween costume party. Did I also mention fan service? The first episode has a full glimpse of that while subsequent episodes does this with bikini outfits and pirate gear. Luckily enough, the show doesn’t make this as its main attraction but rather just as part of its gimmick. <br />
<br />
Soundtrack plays a few key roles. To say the least, the OP song is very catchy not just with the lyrics but by the energy it crafts with almost every character being featured; and in some moments clapping hands in unison. I also give some credit for Kanie’s voice for his ability to really demonstrate his character as a perfectionist. His speeches may sometimes feel laggy but they are to the point with brutal honesty and narcissism. Other characters such as Latifah brings in a gentle atmosphere with her voice while Moffle does the exact opposite of that. However, the OST is easily forgettable even during some emotional scenes of sentimentality. <br />
<br />
Oddly, Amagi Brilliant Park feels like an entertainment showbiz itself. The story offers a variety of ideas although it does falter whenever it tries a bit more than it should have. There is almost an ensemble like cast of characters that the audience may find attached to. Just be aware that these characters play roles like pieces to a puzzle rather than getting depth on their own. For all its technical wizardry, the show is still very much about a guy trying to do his best to save a park that definitely needs to be saved. Fans of other Kyoto Animation works may find this a bit different than what they are used to. It’s not just the different main setting but also because this show plays around with itself like a roller coaster on steroids. <br />

    Summary: Amagi Brilliant Park is a enjoyable anime if you would like to see the MC and his friend build up towards their goals. It has an alright style of conveying the characters emotions, although it has unfinished romance between some of the characters which i don&#039;t like happening in anime I watch.<br />
<br />
Story: The plot for Amagi Brilliant Park is certainly original. I haven&#039;t seen any other anime with this plot and it makes for a good change. Although they do explain why they have to run the park, I would have liked more detail in that aspect. The originality makes up for it though.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181228">
        8/10<br />
<br />
Art: The art in Amagi Brilliant park catches the eye with it&#039;s style of characters. Recently there has been a development in art since the release of 1080p resolution. Well, I guess that isn&#039;t recent, but you get the point. This anime uses the new style of art - and well. 9/10<br />
<br />
Sound: The soundtrack isn&#039;t something amazing, but it suits the anime well. It makes for some emotional scenes even though most of the anime is a casual watch, and is not one of the anime that gives the feels for me. The voice actors perform well in this anime and suits what you think the character would sound like. 8/10<br />
<br />
Characters: The main character is a bit generic, but is one of those &quot;never give up&quot; characters, which suits the anime. For me the backstories could have been told in more detail, but that is not much of a problem. Overall the characters were good. 7/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Although I did enjoy this anime my overall opinion is mixed. I loved the art but the only downside was I would have liked more character development, although the characters were thought out well. 7/10<br />
<br />
Overall 8/10<br />

    A carnival setting in anime, is new for me, so going into this show I didn&#039;t know what to expect, it looked colorful and bright and there was a huge cast so I had a feeling it was gonna be right up my ally. As I started my rollercoaster expecting something pretty good and maybe amazing, by the end of the rollercoaster, I just had a smile on my face, It wasn&#039;t the best ride of my life it was just good. I could sum up Amagi Brilliant Park in just that sentence itself. But this is a review! That would be too dumbwitted.<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179664">
        story here is simple, a park known as Amagi Brilliant Park (hence the name of the show) hasn&#039;t been going well, it needs to have 500,000 visitors in just a couple of months, A highschool student has agreed to be manager but only until they get 500.00 visitors by the time limit he shall thou quit. <br />
<br />
A straightforward story, now I like stories that are easy to understand, its a sign that the show will be more enjoyable and anyone can watch it. Now when I saw this show had 13 episodes I was afraid this show was gonna be rushed but shockingly its the perfect run time for a show like this, didn&#039;t see that coming huh? <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t have too much to say about the story, its simple and good.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
The animation is pretty well done here, with some really nice backgrounds and colorful art style it just shines here.<br />
<br />
Sound:8/10<br />
The music is upbeat and fun. The OP is like a rollercoaster that never stops....until the OP finishes. The ED is Ok for the most part. <br />
<br />
Character:7/10<br />
First we have Saiya. a highschool student who loves himself so much that he denys girls, HA GAY! Well other than that he is a fucking honest and brutal MC, he runs the park like he means it, the creators had balls to make the MC like this compared to other male MCs in modern anime, I give props to that.<br />
<br />
Then we have Isuzu, Saiya&#039;s co-worker, a mindless woman who literally threatens people with some shotgun just to get work done. It seems pretty funny when she stops bad problems using her shotgun. Other than that, she hardly changes throughout the series, by the end of the show she&#039;s still the same as the first episode.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s meant to be some kind of relationship between Isuzu and Saiya, there&#039;s lots of potential for character development, but as soon as it can happen in scenes where the two are alone, it just fails to deliver and they&#039;re back to root one co-workers. Even in the last episode there&#039;s so many chances but the show acts like noting happened.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
This show is episodic for the most part, each episode has its own story and problems and more visitors round up in. It keeps going till the last episode. Now its good this wasn&#039;t 24 episodes, cause that would be very repetitive. The comedy in this show is pretty good, there&#039;s some chuck-worthy moments and scenes where I was laughing.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7/10<br />
Amagi Brilliant Park is a good show that delivers what it can do, it shines in its art and sound and does fairly well in its story and characters, give this show a go, you&#039;ll probably enjoy it. In the end Amagi Brilliant Park was an enjoyable rollercoaster that&#039;ll leave you with a smile on your face.

    Amagi Brilliant Park is a Fantasy, Romantic Comedy anime, where Seiya Kanie is asked to help the park from closing by attracting 250,000 visitors because the staff of the park are from a magical realm called Maple Land and the park is really a facility thats harvests a magical energy form visitors while they are having fun, so they can maintain their existence in the human realm. So as you can see just a normal anime plot, ok really it a really good concept and is very interesting, and i promise the story is really good as they face different situations each episode while trying

          <span style="display: none;" id="review185513">
        to get visitors need to keep the park open. Each episode will surprise, make you laugh and what they do about getting people to come to the park. <br />
Now on to the characters, now i only going to to talk about the main three characters because there is a lot of characters in this anime and i not going too much information about them as the anime does a good job explaining what the characters are like and somethings about main characters are story spoilers. First up is the man himself, Seiya Kanie (Voiced by Kōki Uchiyama), He is a high school student that is highly intelligence, excellent reflexes, has a sharp mind and a narcissist. He is asked by Latifah, the princess of Maple Land to become the manager because of being in the entertainment business before. Next is Isuzu Sento (Voiced by Ai Kakuma), is a royal guard to the princess who carries a rife called Steinberger and is the one to get Kanie to go to the park by forcing him at gun point. She rarely shows emotion, but she hides a very sensitive side. Her gun can be summon from any exposed skin as it is infused magical to her body. After Kanie becomes the manager of the park, she starts developing feelings for him, even if she dislike is arrogant demeanor. The last main character is Latifah Fleuranza (Voiced by Yukiyo Fujii), she is the princess of Maple Land and she asked Sento have Kanie meet her. Due for some reason which is about her frail body, she can&#039;t stay to far from the castle in the park. I would talk more about her and the other characters, but because of spoilers i can&#039;t say more but trust me, the characters are very well made. <br />
Next is presentation, Amagi Brilliant Park is very much colorful and the looks like a very will made anime. It using a similar art design as Is the Order a Rabbit?, as the character are alive with color, the scenery is very lively and overall is very well designed. The characters&#039; animations on screen are smooth, their facial expressions and body language are realistic. Next is the sound/voice acting, the music used for the opening song is very catchy as it beat fits the style of the anime quite well. The ending song is beautiful as the artwork shown when it played is great. The background sounds and music are well created and really fit the feel of a amusement park and the voice acting is very well done as every voice fit it character quite well. Lastly the topics used in the story are well written and doesn&#039;t seen out of place and very Interesting.<br />
Now my thoughts about the anime. Amagi Brilliant Park is a very well written anime as it doesn&#039;t leave any plot point unfinished by the end of the show. It is very funny and it has a very magical way to make you care about the characters i really can&#039;t explain. The characters are very well created and i love them all, but i really like Sento because all i can say her answers to problems is great. Overall i think the anime has been created with a lot of care and has a great story that all can enjoy. I recommend this to everyone as even if a very few scenes are little questionable, all in all it just really fun to watch.<br />
With that said, Amagi Brilliant Park is an anime that should be watch as it concept is unique as there not really an anime like it and can be enjoyed by all ages. If you like unique concepts, liked Is The Order a Rabbit?, just like anime or look to see what anime is like, then i would recommend Amagi Brilliant Park.

    When I heard of this anime I thought the concept sounded ridiculous. A highschool boy becomes the manager of a magical theme park in an attempt to save its workers from doom. To be honest, it is ridiculous. There&#039;s no way around that. Luckily, this anime is so fun and entertaining that it&#039;s easy to forget how stupid it should be.<br />
<br />
The characters help this aspect a lot. All of the main characters get ample development, and a lot of the side characters as well. This helps pull the anime through some of its sillier scenes, and lends weight to what should be cheesy dramatic moments

          <span style="display: none;" id="review194183">
        sprinkled here and there. <br />
<br />
Both the animation and sound are spectacular. There are many memorable bgms, and the opening song is a good way to get fired up for the next episode. The animations and art are precise and colorful, with some surprising flair to be found every once in awhile.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not a big fan of comedies. You could even refer to me as a killjoy. However, this anime made me laugh more often than not. There were some comedic misses here and there, but if something can make you laugh even once, then it succeeds as a comedy. Together with some pleasantly heartwarming scenes and endearing characters, this anime manages to avoid the trainwreck it so easily could have been. Worth a watch if you are in the mood for a light, funny, heartfelt dramedy.

    To be honest, I only considered watching Amagi Brilliant Park because it&#039;s Kyoto Animation. But what kept me watching is my love for theme parks.<br />
<br />
I really thought Amaburi would be an exposition, showing its viewers true-to-life behind the scenes and nitty-gritty aspects of a particular object (in this case, a theme park) - something like Shirobako with anime making - plus an added fantasy in the side. I suppose it is that kind of anime in its own way. Only, most of the elements you encounter are improbable. It&#039;s a fantasy anime, no doubt about it.<br />
<br />
Amaburi&#039;s art is its most dazzling feat. It&#039;s nothing less

          <span style="display: none;" id="review174709">
        from KyoAni. Its visuals are colorful, vibrant, and fluid befitting that of a theme park. KyoAni hasn&#039;t innovated its character design that much but it still packs a punch in Amaburi. Kanie&#039;s, for example, can put the Iwatobi boys&#039; to shame.<br />
<br />
Where the series suffers the most is the story. The first two episodes give us a trajectory. The setting may be cliche in its execution but it gave us a clear goal.<br />
<br />
Afterwards, the succeeding episodes are loaded with filler stories that may or may not make sense and only give the slightest intent of ever reaching that goal. They may give us an inkling of what is needed to run a theme park but they&#039;re nothing more than run-of-the-mill antics with a touch of the improbable. I honestly think KyoAni could have done a better job if they put a little more thought and effort in building the fillers.<br />
<br />
The overarching story is put back in focus in the last five episodes. The series manages to save itself as it slowly unfolds a cute, charming little story amusing enough to keep me watching until the last episode. It is the biggest plus side after that mess of a middle. Save for a few plot holes and open-endings, I can say that Amaburi ended well enough.<br />
<br />
With its characterization, Amaburi keeps it simple. But with its diversity of characters, development was disordered. For some characters, you&#039;ll see them grow as the series progresses and for the others, there is almost no development at all.<br />
<br />
It hits most of what we can expect from an effort by KyoAni - consistent visuals, top-notch character design, and a whole lot of fan service. After Free! and Kyoukai no Kanata, I would have asked for more. But with its variety of scenes, AmaBuri proves how versatile the studio is.<br />
<br />
All in all, Amagi Brilliant Park is a roller coaster ride. It takes you up and down and through the unexpected and ends abruptly enough for you to want more. It may not be the best of what KyoAni has to offer but it is a good addition to their opus. I would recommend this to anyone looking for lighthearted entertainment.

    tl dr; no spoilerino animingo - it sounds lame as fuck but its actually not bad hey.<br />
<br />
This cartoon jumps straight into the action and doesnt mess about. The story was well set up and introduced with easy to recognise and interesting characters. the first 4/5 episodes are related to the over-arching story of needing guests with a few &quot;character helping&quot; episodes in between before finishing the main story. i normally hate this format as it means my fat 300lb ass has to sit through more aneemay and spend less time shaking hands with my man downstairs but it was very enjoyable, each episode had its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180718">
        own charm and interesting conflict, i was never once bored watching this show. it was well combined humour and character/plot development. at 12 episodes long, it did well to tell a good story with a decent level of depth in an entertaining manner.<br />
<br />
The strongest point of this show by far was the characters. I dont think ive ever liked a set of characters as much as this set. <br />
  The main character in particular was one of the most &quot;normal&quot; well rounded characters ive seen. It pisses me off when the main characters of typical shows get all shy when talking to girls, shy when bikini/sex related stuff comes up and just tries to be a goody two shoes in general. He was real, he did things to piss people off, he played the bad guy, he could actually hold a conversation with an attractive girl (much like me irl m&#039;lady *tips federer* (yes i am single. my number is 6942042069)) he wasnt over exaggerated and did shit done without being too personal about it. No i am not homo for this guy but he was funny, had a complex and has a great bum. <br />
  the supporting cast was also well constructed with sufficient development to the extent that i could enjoy every appearance. the three bunnies in the costume were particularly hilarious. their male urges displayed by such a cute and innocent exterior was refreshing to say the least and very all around entertaining. <br />
<br />
There wasnt much i didnt like about the show. The power thing that he gets is rarely used and is almost unnecessary to the point i forgot, on multiple occasions, he even had it. I felt the teaser you get for the next episode is pretty redundant and of course i wanted the main character to fulfil my dreams of tipping all the federers in the world towards the general direction of sento isuzu aka nicetitty-would-let-her-dominate-me-with-whipped-cream-and-dongers gun girl. it is no secret that fat carlton on MAL is a romcom lover and i ship the fuck out of those two like the titanic and the bottom of the atlantic.<br />
<br />

    Ah, amusement parks.  Disney world, Six Flags, Oceanworld, Japan&#039;s DisneySea, we all have wonderful, wonderful memories in them with our families and friends.  But have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes?  (Probably not)  But thankfully, Amagi Brilliant Park gives us this answer in a very nicely done comedic sense.<br />
<br />
Story (7.33/10):  Held against a wall against his will, Kanie Seiya is threatened with his life by a girl at his school by the name of Isuzu Sento, who is holding him by gunpoint.  After being asked (more like forced) to go on a date with her to an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review174523">
        amusement park, he reluctantly goes, before seeing the poor, poor state that Amagi Brilliant Park is in.<br />
<br />
The Story of Amagi follows a rather simple plot line.  As being appointed as the manager of the park, the story follows Kanie as he attempts to make up ways to build up Amagi&#039;s popularity and visitor count, thinking of a new harebrained scheme each episode in order to do it.  In addition with this plot line, the show builds up its character count by adding in more and more side characters as the story goes from episode to episode.  The plot line does work very well for the series and does a great deal of positive things for it, however, there are a couple things that do bring the series down a bit.<br />
<br />
One of bigger flaws for the series is character development.  For the main three characters: Kanie, Sento, and Latifa, the show gives each of them a bit of a backstory for each of them, explaining a little bit about their character and why they are the way they are.  The only problem with this is due to how little it is.  The show is good in its characters because they&#039;re interesting.  The backstories are genuinely interesting.  However, it was a bit disappointing seeing that the characters didn&#039;t get as much development as they could&#039;ve because I would&#039;ve liked to see more of what what made them into what they are.<br />
<br />
Still though, the story overall was good to watch.  The comedy was decently done and the general pacing of the show was good.  Personally, I found myself enjoying the show a lot and looked forward to every episode.  Every episode except the last one was good.  The only reason why the last one felt bad was because it felt REALLY out of place.  I personally would&#039;ve put it a 1 or 2 episodes back before the last one because it didn&#039;t really make sense to put it as the last episode.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  Good story<br />
+  Good comedy<br />
+  Good pacing<br />
-   Not enough character development<br />
-   Out of place last episode<br />
<br />
Characters (7.61/10):  The characters for Amagi were definitely a very interesting and memorable bunch to watch.  I can guarantee that these characters will stick in your head long after you&#039;ve finished the series.<br />
<br />
Kanie Seiya is the main protagonist of the series.  Kanie is a self-proclaimed genius, thinking of himself that he&#039;s good-looking and the center of the world.  (His character is named after Kanye West.  No surprise his character reflects it.)  As a previous child star, Kanie has knowledge over what makes things popular and makes uses of that expertise as a way to make Amagi more popular and appealing to the public.  As the series goes on, you can see Kanie grow as a character as he puts in his time and effort into the Park.  The development is really nice to see and really shows how development can be put into any series.  As a downside however, his character isn&#039;t really explored beyond how he&#039;s a child star.  They don&#039;t explain why he got out of it, or why he went into it into the first place, which really was a downer considering how much more it could&#039;ve added to the story.<br />
<br />
Then we have Isuzu Sento, the Kuudere secretary to Kanie.  Sento is a very interesting character because she doesn&#039;t really have much on the surface, but she really becomes a memorable character.  Her backstory doesn&#039;t really extend beyond the fact that she&#039;s a guard, which is also really disappointing because you don&#039;t really get to know very much.  Her most defining characteristic is her gun, which apparently, she can pull out of any exposed skin, which makes for some decent character moments.  Beyond that, as well as her lack of understanding situations, she doesn&#039;t get very much.  Regardless though, she is still quite a memorable character and does make for a nice secondary main character.<br />
<br />
In addition to these two, there are the other characters which I would consider to be main characters, those characters being Latifa, Moffle, Tiramie, and Macaron.  The first one being the other main character, the other three being the three drunk stooges of the series.  Let&#039;s start with Latifa.  Latifa is what I would consider to be an underused character.  In the series, she&#039;s not really made out to be a prominent character, but more like an important character that doesn&#039;t show up much kind of character.  She doesn&#039;t have a very large presence in the series overall, and mostly only gets proper screentime and plot importance later on.  She has a decent enough backstory to support her character, but I really wish we could get a little bit more from her timewise because she was an adored character that we don&#039;t really get to see.  The other three I mentioned play as a sort of comedy trio, being somewhat essential to the plot by being the park&#039;s main three mascots, creating comedy moments and sometimes conflict, along the way.<br />
<br />
What the series does have lacking as well were some proper character usage.  Most notably, the four elementario fairies.  Personally, I would&#039;ve liked to see Sylphid, Muse, Kobiri, and Salama have a lot more screentime in the series.  The series went to the effort of devoting the ending song to these four, making them the star of it, which really didn&#039;t reflect on how they were treated in the series since they really only got one episode to devote to them, making them just as important as all the other side characters in the series.  Amagi made them look more important than they actually were, so that was a bit disappointing to see.<br />
<br />
Apart from them, we have side characters, a lot of them.  in every single episode, the series introduces new members of the park, both new ones and ones we haven&#039;t met, adding to the ever expanding cast.  What makes these supporting cast members somewhat memorable is both their design, and how they make use of their small bits of screentime.  (But mostly their appearance)  They make the park seem populated with workers, and that&#039;s really about all they do.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  Memorable cast<br />
+  Interesting main characters<br />
+/-  Unfinished character development<br />
-  Supporting cast was a bit too expansive and some weren&#039;t handled too well<br />
<br />
Art and Sound (8.08/10):  Amagi was produced by Kyoto Animation, the same studio that did Haruhi and Lucky Star.  The animation for Amagi does look very high quality.  The colors for the show are very bright-looking, giving off that storybook/fairytale kind of feel due to how primary and light all the characters look.  In addition, the characters look rather simple.  There&#039;s not an absurd amount of decoration in them, but they look very pleasing to the eye.  All in all, the art is definitely fantastic to look at.  It&#039;s nice and simple, crafted very nicely, but it isn&#039;t particularly standout in comparison to other shows.  (That being said, we do have this show to thank for the phrase &quot;Kyo-Ani Butt&quot;)<br />
<br />
As for sound, the show boasts a good duo of opening and ending songs with each of them serving different purposes.  The opening sort of gives off the tone of what you can expect when watching Amagi, starting with a wind-up music box tone before showering you with chords, saying that you&#039;re not watching a fairy tale, this is real, and it&#039;s fantastic.  In contrast, the ending does the opposite, giving off a whimsical tone and sound as it sings about the elemntario fairies and the four elements that they &quot;control&quot; (since they can barely summon water, wind, earth, or fire.)  The ending may or may not stick to your head, but the opening surely can.  (Just listen to the first 10 seconds if you don&#039;t know what I&#039;m talking about.)<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  Good art  <br />
+  Memorable music<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment (8.33/10):  Kyo-Ani has been a good studio for me to watch from.  The stuff that they produce appeals to me and gives me a sense of enjoyment.  This show was no different.  When I found the concept of an amusement park being an anime setting, I thought to myself, &quot;Ok, what kind of shit are they going to make here?&quot;, cause anime has decent comedy from a lot of different settings.  (such as high school, working at a family restaurant, and even about buying from a supermarket for god&#039;s sakes.)  When I watched the show, I was pleasantly surprised, keeping at it because this was a show I genuinely enjoyed.<br />
<br />
Did I like this series?<br />
<br />
Yeah, I did.  The show did keep me intrigued by switching the focus from one part of the park to another, keeping the show fresh with new side characters in order to give the audience a new experience.  In addition, the show did add character growth to its main protagonist, which was a nice plus for the series.  Also, the freaking fairies in this series drink beer.  Have you ever seen a violent mouse with a hat, a perverted pink cat, and a dissatisfied sheep guzzle a couple pints like it was their life?  Thought so.  <br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I like about this series?<br />
<br />
Well, aside from the horrendously out of place final episode, the show didn&#039;t really make use of the backstories that it had set for some of its characters.  We don&#039;t really get to know why Kanie quit his child star career, or why that last-minute protagonist did what he did, or even like the future of Amagi.  Cause I really want to know what happens afterwords.  The main characters didn&#039;t get I feel, enough of a backstory.  They feel incomplete, and I wish we could get just a little bit more bang for our 30 yen entry fee.<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this series?<br />
<br />
Honestly, yes, I would.  It&#039;s a great little comedy series that doesn&#039;t really take itself too seriously.  It&#039;s a nice comedy show that provides some very memorable characters, and even a few choice moments that are actually quite memorable.  While the character development is a bit lacking in that department, and the large amount of side characters may or may not be distracting, Amagi Brilliant Park is a nice place to visit, and I hope you may all visit again.  <br />
<br />
P.S.  Salama best girl.  You are free to disagree in my comments.<br />
<br />
Overall Score: 7.48/10

    “Simply put, we need to go lewder. Miniskirts! Swimsuits! Low-Angle Shots! You need to put in as many of those as you can without breaking the law.”<br />
-Amagi Brilliant Park, Episode 13<br />
<br />
Another season, another project by KyoAni unfolded to the masses. Though it seems as though KyoAni’s latest attempt at trying to appeal to the anime demographic that loves cute and sexy girls is now back in full fashion, I’d think of Amagi Brilliant Park as their apology to all the people who were whining about the “gayness” that KyoAni was ostracizing with their recent hit, “Free!”. Hey, they can make whatever they please, and we

          <span style="display: none;" id="review177061">
        can judge whether it’s worthy of being timeless in their long successful history. In which case Amagi Brilliant Park will only be seen as just another Kyoukai no Kanata; a filler show.<br />
<br />
Whereas Kyoukai no Kanata fell vastly short even to be called a memorable show, a filler show at that, Amagi Brilliant Park is at least commendable to be called a filler show. In the strictest sense, what made me make this distinction while watching this show was how appropriately tame it is with how it portrays the story and setting. Everything is lighthearted, for the most part, and easy for the mind to sit back and relax in pure escapism. As with every anime comedy, there are cute girls in it. KyoAni indeed hasn’t failed on giving us quality girls as opposed to other aspects to an anime.<br />
<br />
All of the main characters are fueled by their appearances and personalities that spark up a great deal of charm to their archetypes. Latifa is typically the girly girl part of the cast that is always optimistic and smiling so we can view her innocence and glamour. Not necessarily the best character considering her backstory is quite exaggerated in the most apathetic way possible, but nothing terrible either. However, there is Isuzu. Quite possibly the one saving grace to the show in her hilarious stoic demeanor. Hilarious in the sense that when she breaks character and starts showing emotion, you have no choice but to squeal with ultimate delight. Plus, you can’t be a true man if you refuse her offer to paizuri you.<br />
<br />
Besides our two main girls, our male protagonist, Seiya Kanie, isn’t anything special. He doesn’t offer any nuanced grandeur to make him stand out like any other memorable KyoAni protagonists before him. But the real crux of the cast are the supporting cast, and there are a lot of them. The problem with this is how so little of the supporting cast barely have anything to make them seem unique other than just being weird mascot characters that are hardly significant in any way. Sure, some of them, particularly Moffle and Tiramie, have some funny moments, but its a quick little comedic pick me up before it’s later tossed away by another funny moment.<br />
<br />
What does make Amagi Brilliant Park unique amongst other of KyoAni’s projects is just how vibrant and colorful they’ve made their art and animation. Earlier in KyoAni’s career, they’ve tried to make their characters seem more realistic despite just relying on the moe-blob formula. They’re still present in here, but what makes this refreshing is how they implement the cartoonish aesthetic to the different characters. Besides our human characters, it’s nice to see KyoAni make these adorable animal mascots and give some spark of creativity to how they interact with their bodies and to each other.<br />
<br />
In closing….oh wait, I forgot about the story. Wait, honestly, what story is there to critique? It’s almost 2nd nature to Amagi Brilliant Park. All there is to service a plot is the characters trying to keep their amusement park from closing down. But the only problem is that they fail even to make that an issue that I should care about since all the fanservice and cute characters drown it out like white noise. Its one of those situations where the show falls flat on story but, then again, that isn’t the whole point, and even the show itself makes this clear as day. When you first show a girl dressed up as a pirate girl in a bikini, your only response is to clap slowly in amusement and go, “Yeah okay, I’ll let this be passable in any measure.”<br />

That’s how Amagi Brilliant Park can be described into one word: passable. Just a bit above passable to where it can be labeled decent in the critical spectrum. As far as KyoAni shows, to which I’ve become not fond of even when they were in their “golden age,” it will nonetheless entertain with enjoyable comedy to splendor about. Sure it’s another show centered around cute girls, but when you see the sight of Isuzu in a cheerleader bikini outfit, it’s a sight that is more than just moe; it’s life.<br />

    TL;DR - Fun for all ages<br />
<br />
Watching Amagi Brilliant Park is refreshing.  You are not watching some kids trying to save the world, or some evil zombie feast, or even (un)popular-guy-loved-by-every-girl-he-talks-to.  Aamgi Brilliant Park is brilliant, entertaining and never fails to amaze.<br />
<br />
(MOSTLY) GOOD - Story<br />
<br />
The series quickly established the premise: the run-down Amagi Brilliant Park, owned by a princess from a land of magic, is in dire situation.  Unless it reaches the yearly quota of half a million visitors in the next three months, it faces foreclosure.  The only saviour is in the form of Kanie Seiya, a narcissistic high school student

          <span style="display: none;" id="review187820">
        who, after much needed coaxing, promised to help out as the park&#039;s new manager.<br />
<br />
Theme park management is probably the last thing you have in mind when it comes to anime.  It works brilliantly as a game (too many theme park sim game to name here), but as an anime, you might think that it would be a tough nut to crack.  Well, Amaburi gladly proves you wrong.  Amaburi is one of the funniest anime in recent time, and it comes down to the story and the characters.<br />
<br />
Each episode is an adventure.  Being a comedy, one would expect the adventure to turn into something that never goes according to plan.  The comedy hits just the right spot at the right time.  Sometimes it is when you least expected it and sometimes you can see it from miles away.  Each episode is a self-contained story, with the overall arc being played out in the background.  That is, until the last few episodes when it is number crunching time.  That&#039;s when the story picks up pace.  Rest assured, the ending is well written (for the most part) without feeling rushed.  In fact, I think the series has good pace overall.<br />
<br />
Without the overarching story of the threat of closure, this anime could go on forever.<br />
<br />
One thing that I like about this anime is that it does not rely (solely) on ecchi to sell the show.  Sure, you get great fan service (check out those racks on Sento!), but they only tell part of the story.  This show is driven by the humorous writing and great characters.  You would develop feelings for the park as it is transferred from the ICU to the general ward as it can now breathe normally without life support.  But will the park be able to leave the hospital in full health, or will its condition suddenly turn south?  You will have to watch it for yourself.<br />
<br />
However, Amaburi is not without its problem.  Because each episode is a self-contained story, sometimes it loses track of the overall picture.  Sure, they are great fun to watch.  But it might not actually have anything to do with saving the park.  I feel that some of the episodes could be done as an OVA while the main series should be concentrated on how Kanie uses his (alleged) brilliance to save the park from collapse.<br />
<br />
GOOD - Character development<br />
<br />
There are plenty of characters in Amagi Brilliant Park, but we only get to know a handful of them.<br />
<br />
For those who we do get to see, they are well rounded and full of energy.  Each character has his / her own personality, not your typical cardboard cut-out character.  Kanie Seiya, while being an egoistic teenager, is actually quite caring and loves his job.  Isuzu Sento is a stoic blank face on the surface, but she has a great sense of responsibility and would do anything in her ability to complete her task.<br />
<br />
The secondary characters like the three main mascots and the four elementary fairies are well loved and have a great sense of humour.  Those viewers with keen eyes might recognise the remarkable resemblance between Moffle and Bonta-kun’s from Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu.  And given the nature of FMP? Fumoffu, one could not be faulted for associating Moffle with comedy.<br />
<br />
The three mascots in particular (Macaron, Tiramie and Moffle) is a major source of entertainment.  Macaron is divorced and refused to pay child support, Tiramie is really a pervert at heart, and Moffle has a violent tendency.  You really can&#039;t judge the book by its cover.<br />
<br />
One strength of the series is letting the characters shine in their own light.  There are episodes where our main characters have little impact on the outcome.  However, this is a double edged sword.  As it stands, letting other characters take the spotlight unfortunately detract the main story line.  A better way would have been letting other characters come up with ways to resolve some of the issues facing the park, rather than the scenarios that ended up in the anime.<br />
<br />
I would love to see other characters being introduced in the series, but sadly, the anime is too short to fully explore the so many lively characters that is employed in the park.<br />
<br />
GOOD - Animation<br />
<br />
The background is colourful and vibrant.  The drawings are crisp, and animation is smooth.  Character design is adequate.  The three main mascots are mascots, so you do not get to see costumes changes.  Other mascots stays the same throughout the series.   Kanie and Isuzu mostly donned the Amaburi uniform, albeit with seasonal variants.  I can count on two hands the number of outfits that Sento wears.<br />
<br />
If fan service is what you are after, there are plenty of that too, though not as much as the creators wanted them to be.  But then again, there is something call the &#039;internet&#039;.  Some search results might come up quite &#039;revealing&#039;.<br />
<br />
BAD - Not Enough Kanie Magic<br />
<br />
I might be nit-picking here, but we have already established in the first episode that Kanie has been gifted with magic that can read minds.  Unfortunately we don&#039;t get to see nearly enough instances where his uses magic to his advantage.  We see Isuzu with her guns from you-know-where, I mean, god-knows-where magic trick every second episode, but in the case of Kanie, I think it has potential to make a regular appearance.  Maybe we can get some comedy out of him reading the minds of guests.<br />
<br />
OVERALL<br />
<br />
The eponymous Amagi Brilliant Park is anything but brilliant.  The park is in such disarray that it is a surprise that there are visitor at all.  But through aggressive marketing and the (alleged) brilliance of Kanie&#039;s management skills, the park is slowly brought back to life.  The anime is a journey to that end.  Though it sometimes detracts from its main goal, Amaburi managed to stay on track long enough to keep the audience interested.<br />
<br />
The anime is a great fun to watch, though that are many potential areas that are left untouched.  Hopefully they could be addressed / expand in future seasons.  Every character has his/her own personality that makes the team so different and dynamic.  The OP and ED have the typical JPOP feel, and the music, though not memorable, is quite soothing to listen to.  The animation is marvellous.  Plot is great, entertainment and funny.  If only the series was longer.

    I&#039;m really glad I watched Amagi Brilliant Park, one reason being it stems away from the generic storyline of anime its kind. ABP is best described as having a &quot;slice of business&quot; vibe with a magic orientated twist, making the comedy aspect a lot smoother and unique throughout the show. What&#039;s not unique or amusing about a bunch of drunk, lewd-minded mascots running around a magical decrepit amusement park? <br />
<br />
I honestly thought every aspect of this anime was really well balanced. Not too many jokes, the jokes they did have were actually funny since the character development was decent and the romance didn&#039;t flood the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review191791">
        storyline which left it simple and light hearted enough to sit back and enjoy. <br />
<br />
The main characters were well designed, leaving me with a major crush on Isuzu. She wasn&#039;t your average brain dead hot girl in a cute uniform, she was a blunt, seemingly insensitive bad ass with an awesome gun, PLUS the cute uniform. Despite how cold she comes across, throughout the show it becomes more apparent how sensitive and misunderstood Isuzu is, making her more relatable.<br />
<br />
Seiya Kanie also wasn&#039;t your typical male protagonist, his irritating, perfectionist-totally conceded vibe was portrayed well enough to leave you somehow still loving him. Yeah, he&#039;s a cocky prince, but through his hard work and time at the park it&#039;s made apparent he&#039;s a kind-hearted, caring and overall lovable one at that.<br />
<br />
Despite the shows short length, the rest of the cast were all well developed. Very unique and dynamic characters, not just boring background noise. They added a very nice touch to the show and really shaped the perfect atmosphere for the park. <br />
<br />
Art: Very vivid and colourful, a definite pleasant watch. Made me fall in love with all the characters. That HD baby.<br />
<br />
Sound: Not much to say really, nothing special but definitely above average. <br />
<br />
Overall: Definitely worth a watch if you&#039;re down to relax to a unique, quirky show with brilliant(heh) artwork. <br />

    Amagi Brilliant Park is a high energy, fun comedy anime with a large amount of characters that all have their own unique personalities. There has been a lot of hype built around this anime, many people saying that this is a must watch, one of the best anime of the fall 2014 season, possibly one of the best of 2014.<br />
<br />
I for one, did not receive any of said hype, and didn&#039;t watch while the show was still airing. I eventually started watching Amagi Brilliant Park a few months later, and boy did I miss out on something amazing!<br />
<br />
Summary: It begins by introducing our self absorbed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186007">
        MC, Seiya Kanie, who has been forced to go on a &quot;date&quot; to an amusement park by our main heroine, Isuzu Seno. From this, he is brought into a world of magical creatures from another world that want him to help get 500,000 guests in 3 months. Can, or will he do it?<br />
<br />
Now onto the review!:<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
The story was pretty straightforward, the park in trouble of being shut down, if the goal of 500,000 guests was not reached within 3 months. For the most part, it was pretty episodical, though there was still character and plot development each episode, making the show pretty enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
Wow, I have to give credit where it&#039;s deserved, the art was absolutely amazing, though the animation was average, the beautiful art made up for the animation.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
The sound was very consistent, the Opening and Ending songs were fantastic, especially the Opening song, it got me pumped up to watch each episode! LOOK AT THE SKY IT&#039;S MAGIC HOUR!! Ahem... Outside of that, the OST was beautiful.<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
Now the characters, while some seemed a little generic, they put a twist on each character to make them unique to the show... and I loved each and every one of them. From the self obsessed MC, socially challenged heroine, to the perverted and hilarious mascots, I truly loved all of them, and the interactions between all the characters. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
What can I say, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, I found myself laughing at almost every joke and funny moment, and caring what happens to the characters at every point.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
Creators of Amagi Brilliant Park, Bravo! You made a great anime.

    Need something to make you rolling on the floor? Well then, You found it.<br />
<br />
This series are full of comedy, each episode are episodic, just a random problem solving, and every little things is very funny.<br />
<br />
You&#039;ll find a few chara design not well fitted with their personalites, I mean who supposed to be cute and all, but the creators makes they to act differently. Even so I think that&#039;s the good idea and I supposed to say that&#039;s makes it the most funniest point in this anime.<br />
<br />
The art style are good and fit in with the magical theme.<br />
<br />
Eventhought the main story base are so-so, but overall

          <span style="display: none;" id="review177767">
        the show was good for me, I found a great time watching this anime and of course laughing so loudly.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, it would be best if the main story base is made more developed with 12 more episode (That was too short for a good show like this). So I hope it will be a season 2 soon.

    How could a perfect, prior child actor, mythical princess, rage-stricken mouse and a perverted pink pomeranian (alliteration much?) recover a slumbering theme park from to its old days of glory?  I&#039;ll admit, I literally had no idea how the hell that was going to happen before I tuned into Amagi Brilliant Park.  This is one of those shows that grabbed my goldfish attention span with a sticky glove and refused to let me get to my ever-growing backlog.  I was in the mood for a lighthearted series with lots of laughs and colorful pizzazz, nothing more.  What Amagi delivered ended up

          <span style="display: none;" id="review212490">
        being a pleasant surprise in the slew of mediocre shows coming out these days.  And I don&#039;t give out 7&#039;s to just any show … well maybe I do.<br />
<br />
Amagi Brilliant Park is a story about a perfectionist high school student named Seiya Kanie with a knack of pissing off literally everyone around him with his incessant narcissism.  I mean the dude is named after Kanye West! I feel that speaks volumes of his character and personality from the get go.  Through a date arrangement with a fairy royal guard member named Isuzu Sento, he is tirelessly recruited into helping a magical theme park help to restore its popularity and subsequent revenues in order to stay in business.  The entire effort is led by a frail Princess named Latifah Leuranza (named after Queen Latifah herself) who was crippled by a magical wizard and forced into a permanent form of a 14 year old for eternity.  I know this sounds ridiculous (and it is), but bear with me.  Once Seiya delves deeper into helping the park&#039;s members out, he quickly realizes how deep in doodoo they actually are.<br />
<br />
The story isn&#039;t generic by any means, so I have to award some credit for originality.  However, it doesn&#039;t entirely avoid pitfalls that most short animes fall into (plot holes, under-developed antagonists).  Also, although adapted from a Light Novel by Shoji Gatoh, there are certain parts of the this adaptation that didn&#039;t translate over to the anime.  I tend to forgive this small issue, since I don&#039;t really read manga to begin with.  I mean, think of how many movies differ from their associated novels.  Seiya has a large number of interesting interactions with the other park employees as well, including plentiful physical altercations with Latifah&#039;s uncle Moffle (yes, he&#039;s actually a mouse and yes, he&#039;s the same Moffle from Full Metal Panic if you didn&#039;t already realize that).  At first, it just seems as though the reasoning for Amagi Brilliant Park needing to acquire more guests and popularity is purely monetary, but an unfolding backstory backstory of how the park was created sheds new light on that opinion.  Since the park is “magical”, it relies on assimilated energy from the guests happiness due to visiting the park to stay in operation.<br />
<br />
All magic and character antics aside, the writers actually do a decent job at making you feel a sense of empathy for the magical fairies that reside at the park.  You end up cheering them on to get the amount of guests they need for that day, as well as shedding tears when things don&#039;t quite go their way.  Seiya does a fantastic job at playing the leader and manager as well, and he&#039;s initially very honest with them about how much they suck at being adequate magical carneys.  I mean that IS what they are, right?  Also, through the weeds of hilarity and vulgarity, there are quite a number of uplifting morals contained in Amagi.  I wouldn&#039;t necessarily let young children watch it (thanks Tiramie!), but even the pretentious intellectuals of the anime community could find one less anime to shit on for not being intellectually challenging enough. <br />
<br />
There are a boat load of characters to enjoy in Amagi Brilliant Park.  Seiya is initially the MC you love to hate, constantly admiring himself in the mirror and putting his vanity on display, but he contains a reasonable amount of depth as the series progresses.  Not only do we get to understand why he is such an asshole, but the writers also shed some light on his child-acting past and his previous ties to Amagi Brilliant Park itself.  I always enjoy animes with protagonists I don&#039;t want to take a figurative shit all over due to their annoying sense tropey-ness.  Isuzu is a great character balance to Seiya in many ways.  She&#039;s no yandere, but she does have deadpan humor (or no humor for that reason), and can tend to violently police Seiya and the other members of Amagi&#039;s cast.  Not to mention that she&#039;s got the looks and endowment to make her a staple on any pleb&#039;s waifu list.  I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if one or more otakus out there had a pillow made of her after the show aired.  Latifah is frail and often passes out during periods of too much physical exertion, but she does make some good food.  Oddly enough, she was also blind in the light novel, but perhaps the anime directors assumed this would distract viewers from the rest of the story.  Besides her over-arcing role, she didn&#039;t really get much more depth.<br />
<br />
The supporting cast has something for everyone.  The aforementioned anime-jumping Moffle often scuffles with Seiya, and he has a tendency to fly off the handle, but when it comes to his niece Latifah, he plays a softy in every way.  Moffles best friends are Tiramie, a pink pomeranian and Macaron, a male sheep who plays the violin and can be somewhat of a dead beat.  Tiramie is hands down one of the funniest anime characters I&#039;ve ever come across.  The constant perverted jokes and cat-calls he makes at women coupled with a love for explosives ensures there&#039;s never a dull moment with him around.  I literally went almost the entire show without realizing he was not a girl.  This dude is fucking hilarious! There&#039;s also 4 voluptuous vixens that double as the Elementario fairies, each with a unique personality but they often fight as a result.  They provide the seemingly necessary fan service in Amagi.  This anime has such an insane amount of characters, that I couldn&#039;t list them all, but due to this a problem arises with character development.  It&#039;s really only there for Seiya and Isuzu.  I would almost argue that this show doesn&#039;t need it to keep me entertained, but it would probably catapult even higher on my list if that were the case.<br />
<br />
It can be really hard to rate the art in modern animes.  I mean, it&#039;s kind of all starting to look the same if you think about it.  In Amagi&#039;s case, the art style neither helps nor hurts it as an overall series.  It&#039;s pretty to look at, but if you really pick it apart I&#039;m sure you could find plenty of tiny things that would irritate your pompous critical side.  I can applaud the relatively complex character models this series possesses between the animals and inanimate objects that are personified and made lively and colorful.  The voice acting is well done, and not to sound like a fanboy or anything, but Ai Nonaka did fantastic as Tiramie.  Well, at least I was correct in my presuming the role was played by a girl...  I also thoroughly enjoyed the opening of Amagi.  It really pumps you up for each episode.  I feel that an OP should either add some depth to the series, or get you excited for the upcoming episode.  Sometimes it&#039;s like the producers say, “here&#039;s this semi-intelligent premise, oh and here is some random ass OP that has completely ruins the vibe the show was going for.”  The ED was nothing special, and being that it was only 12 episodes, I felt that it was better to just binge instead.  Sound effects were spot on, and the rest of the OST was okay, but I never really noticed there was background music to begin with.<br />
<br />
I thoroughly enjoyed Amagi Brilliant Park for what it was.  The series was a slight anecdote to my backlog and it fill well as both a comedy and a motivational genre.  I would recommend this series to someone who just wants to take a break from all the shounen or serious animes they&#039;ve been watching as of late.  Although I don&#039;t expect this world to be explored again, I think it act as a pillar for a series of sequels, if it were in the writer&#039;s future plans.  Thanks for reading!<br />

    I honestly do not understand how this series is getting above a 5 rating.  It&#039;s truly mind boggling.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re 5 years old you might enjoy the campiness of this show.  Otherwise there&#039;s plenty of much better comedies out there than this.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
--------<br />
Haphazard and disjointed drivel.  No coherent thought or cohesion.  It bounces all over the place and at the same time (I stopped after watching episode 5) never goes anywhere.  It&#039;s just bad and it hurt to watch as far as I did.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
--------<br />
Mediocre at best.  Certain aspects are used repeatedly and that gets tedious to see.  <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
--------<br />
Repetitive and annoying

          <span style="display: none;" id="review208588">
        songs.  The sound itself was good though.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
--------------<br />
A bit of thought went into the characters but not so much to make it above a 4 rating in my book.  Lots of characters just blend together by episode 5.  That&#039;s not that great and made me wonder if the company didn&#039;t make this anime just for a tax write off.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
--------------<br />
For me... it felt torturous just to get to the end of episode 5.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
----------<br />
I enjoy good shows and will remark positively on them when I see them but this one STUNK.  It&#039;s amazing that enough people thought this was actually good.

    I started watching Amagi Brilliant Park, with a mindset &quot;I am gonna drop this after a few episodes.&quot; A killer start and a hilarious graduation of sit-com, throughout the series, got me hooked and now I am craving for more.<br />
<br />
The first two episodes builds up the goal of the story. After that, it switches to a slice of life and comedy style of story telling, where this goal is still present, but in a background in a unintrusive form. I think it helps to enjoy the characters and the fantasy elements even more.<br />
<br />
The anime adapts the light novels in a non-chronological order and changes a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review184606">
        few details in characters. Although these details are not that important and will not make the anime feel chaotic and out of touch with the novels. (I would pick up the light novels, but there is no translation group that picked it up and yen press didn&#039;t license it so far.)<br />
<br />
The main character is dominant during the story. Well, he is more of an &quot;OK&quot; character, but I had more fun and enjoyment with the fantasy side characters. The way they adapted to the world is hilarious. They have the best lines and moments in the story.
