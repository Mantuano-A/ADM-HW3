    With Urobuchi gone, I didn&#039;t expect much of this season. It still failed my expectations.<br />
<br />
I expected to, much like the second season, for it to try and explore the themes set out by the first season at the base of Psycho Pass&#039; world. Instead, we have a plot centered around the introduction of a completely new entity, Bifrost, that contradicts the position Sybil appeared to have when Urobuchi.<br />
<br />
I expected it to remain grounded in the world set out by the previous seasons, but, after 8 double-length episodes, Arata still appears to come up just short of clairvoyance, the perfect control of the Sybil System is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323743">
        contradicted by the existance of intentional gaps in it&#039;s control, and the politics of Sybil controlled Japan, which were previously stated to be a sham, are suddenly an institution with actual power and influence, and all changes going unadressed.<br />
<br />
I expected the main characters from the previous season to be a constant presence in order to continue their stories. Instead, Shimotsuki appears to have undergone significant development almost entirely offscreen, and, for the longest time, Ginoza, Akane, and Kogami occasionally show up as barely a cameo, mostly to hint at further developments.<br />
<br />
I also found the plot overall harder to follow than when Makishima discoursed at length on philosophy and Sci-fi references for several minutes at a time. That might have to do with having to wrap my head around the inconsistencies in world building. The characters of season 3 can spend several minutes discussing the implications of a political elections and just leave me scratching my head, wondering why, under the totalitarian control of Sybil, that would be important.<br />
<br />
As a minor gripe, I wish we had seen the Dominators being used more often, but I guess that&#039;s a symptom of the smaller presence of the Sybil System in the world of Season 3. We did get some nice looking fist fights, but it&#039;s jarring for the inspectors, representatives and arbiters of Sybil&#039;s ultimate will, to have to engage in punch ups when any intent to beat an inspector to death should cloud one&#039;s hue enough for them to be justifiably used. I&#039;m not sure we even saw the non-lethal paralyzer being used at all.<br />
<br />
In short, I doubt I&#039;ll be back to this series. My expectations were low, but the contradictions in worldbuilding, the lack of a concrete continuation of anything set by the previous seasons, and a complete lack of any conclusion amount to a complete lack of justification for the existence of another entry to the series. Considering the way the last episode felt, the post-credits scene, and the name of the next movie indicating that it might be a prequel, everything just make me feel like the intent here is to slap the Psycho Pass name on an unrelated sci-fi detective series rather than continuing what made it interesting back in 2012.

    Although the hype around the series has died down due to the very long wait between seasons, there were definitely a few longtime fans who were excitedly following the news that Psycho-Pass was finally getting another season. As one such fan I was quite pleased that one of my favorite series was getting another expansion, even though I was worried it might be a letdown like season 2 was. However, a few things set this season apart from the prior season which led me to increase my rating for the show this specific season, although not to the heights of the first and greatest season,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323730">
        I will expand on these things in this review.<br />
<br />
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
The first thing I would like to mention happens to be the characterization between the 2 new main characters. It becomes fairly obvious within the first episode and even before it if the viewer watched the sinners of the system movies for Psycho-Pass, which I highly recommend one does before they watch this season, that there would be a fairly large time skip involved. One thing I did not expect however was that Akane Tsunemori would be entirely replaced as the main character by 2 new inspectors, Shindou and Ignatov. At first, I was apprehensive about getting a new set of lead characters especially since the movies hyped Kougami returning to the cast, however the 2 new characters grew on me over time. They both had great chemistry on screen, good backstories on why they joined the bureau, and their decision to partner up despite the Sybil System recommending otherwise was definitely a nice touch. There were some things I did not like such as Shindou having what appears to be borderline magical powers in recreating people’s actions and decision making and having superhuman reflexes that greatly surpass any human shown in the series thus far. However even though flaws like this existed I managed to get past my initial apprehension, and it was definitely worth it, if you are looking for strong leads with great chemistry taking over our favorite sci fi  cop drama anime then you will definitely be pleased with the 2 new inspectors.<br />
<br />
Something else the show excelled at was amazing fight choreography, all the fight scenes were incredibly fluid and the hand to hand fight choreography is definitely some of the best I have seen out of 100s of action anime. At times the fight choreography does get ridiculous, for example the characters try fighting an actual combat robot hand to hand even though their dominators should have a lethal decomposer mode and the show also has scenes where characters choose to fight hand to hand over using the paralyzer mode. Despite this the fight scenes were so good it makes it possible to not question the decision making of the characters and to overlook this bad writing during those scenes. <br />
<br />
In regard to the sound track and music of the series, the openings of Psycho-Pass have always delivered, and this season is no exception. The OP consisted of a great song, with excellent foreshadowing visuals that that I am sure any fan pf the original Psycho-Pass would be satisfied by. Some other noteworthy aspects were careful reuse of the old soundtrack specifically when Kougami finally showed up in the show really had a strong impact. The sound is definitely a high 8 and lives up to the original series entirely.<br />
<br />
One other thing that improved was how the side characters and antagonists were dealt with, most of the notable side characters got a decent amount of screen time, some new characters were fleshed out fairly thoroughly with the help of the sinners of the system movies and most of them got their time in the spotlight. Although the characters in the show do lack the depth of the characters in the first season, especially since there was no strong antagonist like the first season, the new antagonists and cases were still fairly easy to watch and made for a strong cop show. <br />
<br />
As far as the story is concerned the lack of a truly strong antagonist really getting the viewer to question the system was definitely something that this show lacked, although the current organization opposing Sybil is interesting, there aren’t any particular noteworthy characters representing them. Season 1 was great because the audience was rooting for the antagonist at times and really growing to despise the system yet at the same time at the very end of the show understanding why Akane chose to preserve the system and relating it to the necessary security state many people in real life live in. This season did have moments throughout every episode where characters questioned why the system worked the way it did and if it was fair, but overall the entire show was focused on suppressing the enemies of the system and not really taking a serious look at flaws of the system itself like the predecessor seasons did. Most of the antagonists were clearly bad people who lacked any good reasons on why they are causing problems, there wasn’t any focus on the system oppressing them, in fact most of them were high up in the system. Near the end of the season there were antagonists who were acting for the greater good to some extent but the means they took were not only to extreme, they were straight up bad ideas that wouldn’t have been effective, the antagonist in the first season had considerably better ideas. The story overall is still good and definitely flowed better than most of season 2 however it still pales in comparison to season 1, right now the series is a good sci fi action show, but it is no longer a philosophical thought provoking series filled with flawed characters and ideas of justice like the original. <br />
<br />
Production IG has outdone themselves with the art and animation of the series, the backgrounds of the city were spectacular to look at and really built up the sci fi atmosphere. All the detailed touches to the streets, buildings, waterfront, food stalls, hotel lobbies, and everything else in the background really immerses the viewer in this futuristic world that is both an exciting wonderland and at the same time a terrifying view on a society plagued by an all encompassing and dominating police state. As mentioned earlier the fight choreography and animation were great and despite the longer episodes on a weekly release schedule the animation quality remained strong throughout. Fans of the series can look forward to good visuals, good fights, fluid animation, and a variety of interesting looking characters.<br />
<br />
Overall these improvements do vastly improve the show for the viewer in comparison to season 2, however it stills pales in comparison to season 1. If you are a big fan of this series then it is a must watch, but if you are not then it is essentially a regular solid sci fi action show, so if that isn’t really what you want to watch then you may not be into this. I would give this show a score of 8/10 as it was something that is quite enjoyable to watch, and it did not fail at delivering any important technical quality.<br />

    -Note: English is not my native language, I apologize for possible mistakes. (This review does not contain spoilers)<br />
<br />
After the enormous emptiness that excellent villain Makishima Shougo left us and that great first season of PP, we finally have an acceptable sequel that tries to bring new things, new characters and similar airs, but not the same. Although of course we will always miss our dear and handsome Kougami, right? Well, at least in my case if I love it too much.<br />
<br />
I generally liked how it was carried out this season, without making the mistakes of the second, without using protagonists of the previous season for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323736">
        a long time and using new protagonists, it has allowed the story to develop acceptably, something that the second season failed to start with the villain that without offending was and felt like a cheap copy of the first villain or at least I felt that, and I think a good percentage too, without demeriting the good things that the second season has, that there are.<br />
<br />
Also something to note is that each episode at the beginning has excellent fighting scenes and animated choreographies with incredible quality, and those scenes are in almost every episode. It&#039;s great and more considering that it lasts twice as much as the rest of the animes per week, 50 minutes per episode which was a surprise.<br />
<br />
I can criticize things, such as the small participing of the old protagonists although I liked it, felt this somewhat forced, there are also many loose ends from the beginning, events that occurred off-screen that keep the viewer&#039;s doubt at all times, especially when dealing with Akane Tsunemori.<br />
<br />
The series comes to feel somewhat episodic at certain times and very detective with various cases that do not stop feeling a bit like &quot;Normal Cases&quot; can be said that there are too many sub-plots developing in Psycho-Pass 3, remembering the anarchist Makishima in the entire first season of Psycho-Pass, this was touches more philosophical themes, not at all compared to the most detective theme the series has had since its second season.<br />
<br />
Here we are presented to Bifrost a criminal and clandestine organization that operates through this indirect gambling game for elitists to gain and power in the shadow of Sybil and the change of social paradigms. Makishima instead wanted to demolish social foundations and &quot;faced Sybil&quot;  head on. However, the plots of past characters converge with that of the new ones to reach a climax, I love these kinds of stories, they do not stagnate with only one protagonist throughout the story and they explore the rest of the characters in depth to create tangles and secluded frames that are focused at the end for one thing in common.<br />
<br />
As a personal point,  I want to write about Mika&#039;s character, I didn&#039;t like Mika much in Psycho-Pass 2 but she&#039;s quickly become such an amazing and funny character starting in the first Sinners of the System OVA &amp; continuing strong throughout Psycho-Pass 3. Definitely one of more entertaining characters.<br />
<br />
As for the animation and the OST are excellent, if there is something that stands out a lot in PP, it&#039;s this incredible soundtrack which is always at the top, and as I said before its animation and especially its fight scenes are very remarkable.<br />
<br />
Finally, I think that Psycho-Pass 3 despite having twice as many minutes per episode, needed more chapters to be able to elaborate a story at 100% conditions.<br />
<br />

    Story<br />
The strength of this show, in my opinion, lies in the webs weaved by the unseen higher powers,i.e Bifrost and Sibyl. Each episode expanded the world to an extent, with immigration being the main issue at hand. Because of immigration, of for the sake of the issue , commit crimes as per their beliefs, whether it be using religious organizations as a front, creating/mass producing weapons, etc. The long run time of each episode allows the viewer to understand the issue at hand and end with a somewhat satisfying conclusion. There rarely is a cliff hanger and that is a great strength of this show.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323737">
        The show attempts to show the connection of all the minor antagonist, however it doesn&#039;t really get through until the end (and by the end I mean the eighth episode).  In someways the Bifrost and the congressmen are still as confusing as they were in the first episode( I still don&#039;t know what they mean by relation). <br />
<br />
Character:<br />
The introduction of new characters as the viewers perspective allowed new watchers a reprieve from the old. The inclusion of the foreign bureau while important  seems little more than cameos at this point, if the show does not have another season, as Kogami and Akane do very little in the main plot other than fight a little, and reference the plot(somewhat) of previous seasons.The new characters are semi interesting but as they have yet to finish their character arcs, and the anime was wholly dedicated on writing an intricate plot, sometimes the characters fall short of likable(as in my favorite character that I remember more than a few traits about). My one complain in the story is the constant attempts to bring up Arata&#039;s father, when Arata does it fine, but every other side character...why? It&#039;s a bit annoying to be honest... My very last nitpick is in the final episode Arata&#039;s mentalist powers have transformed from being able to figure out anyone&#039;s thought process by listening to the sound of rain, to being able to manipulate anyone(Maybe I misheard/read that but Kei&#039;s sudden accusations made no sense to me).<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art was fairly good, the characters were distinct and in action scenes their features were not lost, alongside the movements being fluid. My favorite parts were watch Arata doing parkour, or Kei beating up goons. The art otherwise is standard and very clear. Overall the tone was dark, matching the show&#039;s setting and intentions.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The opening and ending are quite catchy with the animations following it quite fluidly. Other than that the soundtracks within the anime matched the pacing and tone of every scene, so while it did it&#039;s job, but maybe it&#039;s nothing to write home about. Overall the opening and ending are better than most of the openings and ending of this anime season.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
A story with an air of mystery up until the end, answering some questions and leaving many others unfulfilled. The core of this anime is different than many others and because of it&#039;s uniqueness , as well as it&#039;s different perspective , it&#039;s fairly easy to enjoy.Though, you may need to strap down when watching because if you aren&#039;t pay attention, everything will go right over your head.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
The anime is dark, mysterious, and explores interesting themes and plot threads. The characters have a certain level of appeal to them and luckily they don&#039;t require much investment on the viewer&#039;s part. It&#039;s hard to follow if you aren&#039;t paying attention, and skimming is almost nigh impossible. It&#039;s best to watch this when your&#039;ready to bunker down for suspense and drama.Note that this anime rarely if ever has notes of comedy, but at the very least it isn&#039;t going to bawl your eyes out(or maybe tear up for that matter). The sole focus of the show is it&#039;s story, and I believe , at the very least, it delivers an intriguing story.<br />
<br />
P.S if there was to be another season, this anime would overall only gain value, as of my writing this review I&#039;m unaware if there is no following season as such , this is my grading without consideration of a following season.<br />

    I was hoping this would be a witty, interesting detective spin-off with new characters to love and enough removal from the original source material to maintain fresh writing in the futuristic world of the Sibyl System I was enthralled with watching first season. <br />
<br />
So far, at episode 5/8 (with twice the time per episode to develop plot and characters), I find myself incredibly disappointed with the trajectory of the show. Each episode is supposed to be its own  detective story with some subtle hints at an overarching “grand finale” plot. However, NONE of the characters aside from the two leads have any personality at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review322630">
        all. The writer opts for one-liner clichés and trope-heavy indirect characterization. When it’s alluded that a “mole” might be present in the Public Safety Bureau, it’s hard to even care, because we know so little about the characters IN the Public Safety Bureau. Any intrigue that might become available to the viewer feels hollow, as we don’t get to know the characters interacting with story developments (and because a lot of story developments happen in “round table” discussion format that is monotonous and long-winded to watch.) <br />
<br />
There are several things about the writing that are cumbersome--we learn early on that Arata has special powers, but the viewer doesn’t have the pleasure of discovering more about how they work or his background. Instead, we get to see him collapse a bunch of times in a bunch of ways, all while his partner picks up the pieces. It makes the “detective genius with an odd quirk” trope get old REALLY fast. Sometimes you get a taste of maybe learning something new and fresh, but then it’s dropped or left unexplored. Part of the issue is the show opts for adding new characters or pieces to the puzzle for intrigue instead of using the core pieces it already has efficiently. What’s left is a confusing jumble of forgotten characters and vague tangents that promise more info with no follow through. <br />
<br />
Social and political issues such as immigration and economic evil are referenced, but the exploration of these themes remains shallow at best. It feels like the social issues that are discussed and the world building run parallel—when the writer tries to intersect the two, it feels clunky. I’m still holding out hope for developments towards the end, but as it is now, the show already has quite a few problems. <br />
<br />
I will say that the animation and music, particularly during the fight scenes, are entertaining and well executed (though few and far between). If you’re a completionist or die-hard fan, this is bearable content. But if you’re looking to get into the series this way, or are satisfied with how the last two seasons played out, it’s safe to say you can skip this storyline. <br />

    Story(8): We are only 4 episodes in so the anime is currently at its early stages(will update soon after it finishes), hence the low rating. So far I think the buildup is going great, we are taken on a somewhat different path from other seasons(not all about sibyl being bad) and i think this is something new and fresh. I think there are many aspects to this story and we have seen the branching stories, like the gambling game and the stalker duo. Im looking forward to it all connecting but so far definitely not the letdown s2 was for me(villain was good tho XD).<br />
<br />
Art(10):

          <span style="display: none;" id="review322258">
        Psycho pass s3 is probably the best anime in 2019 production-wise. If you&#039;ve watched do I even have to say anything? The CG is top-notch, the animation and art are all outstanding. In episode 2 the brawl out between kogami and the enforcers in that camcorder style fashion was breath-taking.<br />
<br />
Sound(9): Why you may ask? Psycho pass ost has always been phenomenal and anytime they include ost 1 from the original its a 10/10 moment.<br />
<br />
Character(9): Since we are 4 episodes in not much has been released. However, episode 3 gave us a closer look at the new faces. Honestly, I love these characters now, the family disgrace and the protector of the neighbourhood. The bond that Arata and ignatov share, as well as Ignatova&#039;s struggle in a foreign country, was all great character development. I now feel much more invested in these characters and am looking forward to seeing their character arc unfold.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment(9): I love psycho pass, season 1 was a 10/10 for me no questions. S3 so far has been amazing the 2009 stock market crisis was really fun to see in chibi mode. The very concept of mystery, tech and dystopias is very enjoyable to watch. With the 1 hour episodes, I can enjoy a lot more content however an issue I found with the second episode was that they ended the first part halfway through the 2nd episode which was kinda weird.<br />
<br />
Overall(9): S3 of psycho pass is shaping up to be a great season and I highly recommend you to watch if ur an avid fan of psycho pass. Its a culmination of dystopia, mystery, and futuristic gadgets. What&#039;s not to love?

    If you&#039;ve read any one of a third of my reviews, you will know that Psycho-Pass&#039; first season is one of my favorite works of art/literature/entertainment/whatever of all time. It&#039;s a downright classic. That said, I was not particularly wowed by its second season (I read the manga and wrote a review on that) or the sequel film, which I found rather boring. Additionally, while I have yet to see the Sinners of the System films, I haven&#039;t heard the highest of praise for them. In short, I wasn&#039;t buying into the idea that the show&#039;s producers wanted this franchise to be as successful as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323818">
        Ghost in the Shell (and boy was THAT property ever milked...), and I grew to accept that season 1 was really the only entry worth watching (also rewatching twice, apparently!) and buying on Blu-ray; I settled into a state of quasi-indifference toward the franchise, especially when I learned that Tow Ubukata was back from season 2 to work on season 3.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s not to say that Tow Ubukata is a bad writer; while it is true that Le Chevalier d&#039;Eon did little to intrigue me and GitS Arise was (apparently) disappointingly bad, there is no denying that the man has ideas that are worth exploring. This even applies to Psycho-Pass 2, what may be considered the most hated project to which he was attached. Ubukata has gone on record in interviews detailing many of the problems he and the writing staff faced, most notably the atrociously tight deadlines (they would finalize the script DURING dubbing sessions), and it&#039;s clear that said deadlines (compounded by the show&#039;s insane brevity and need to copy season 1) was a main reason why it was unable to explore the few unique ideas that it could allow in a more nuanced and exciting way while telling a wholly new story, ideas like the Sibyl System having a direct opposer/rival that wishes to see it destroyed.<br />
<br />
Well, thanks to Tow Ubukata, a similar idea is in season 3. But, really, that&#039;s the least superficial difference between seasons 1 and 3; let&#039;s take a look at something more broad, like the show&#039;s genre.<br />
<br />
Season 1 was not a mystery series. It&#039;s got elements of neo-noir, dystopia, science fiction, police procedural, and thriller, but NOT MYSTERY. Season 3 is most definitely a mystery; we don&#039;t see how crimes are committed, characters&#039; intentions are really only ever hinted at until the big reveal, etc. This show is more like GitS:SAC season 1 than other Psycho-Pass titles, and I think this was exactly the direction the producers&#039; meetings took: &quot;We need to stay true to the roots of why we wanted to make this franchise in the first place. What about its writing style made GitS:SAC so popular and how can we incorporate that style into Psycho-Pass?&quot; &quot;Well, it was more like a police drama you would typically see on TV, not anything revolutionary; just with cyberpunk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Did they only then realize that there was a gaping bullet hole in their project&#039;s foot? Probably, but I also wouldn&#039;t think it beyond them to realize that it was Gen Urobuchi, the season 1 head writer, who pulled the trigger.<br />
<br />
The problem with Psycho-Pass for so long has been that it simply wasn&#039;t sustainable. You can&#039;t take a fictional world so tightly constructed to be self-contained and revolutionary in just one season of television and make a franchise out of it, that&#039;s just not viable. They tried, but it was never going to work because a setting can only be geared toward a very specific set of themes, and season 1 covered that set very well already. Rather than attempt to recapture that same exact lightning in a different bottle, they finally started doing what I have been thinking they needed to do for a while now: change the setting. If the fictional world doesn&#039;t serve the purposes you need it to, change key details about that world so it does. Season 3 is the first entry in the franchise to do just that; the newly-incorporated anti-isolationist policies in Psycho-Pass&#039; Japan has caused an influx of refugees from all around the heavily war-torn globe, and this adds a sense of tangible progression to the timeline as well as allowing for new stories with new themes to be told and the introduction of more problems that have been affecting us in the present, namely the rise of isolationist movements and more overt racism/bigotry and hate crime throughout the world. Also, Japan is absolutely notorious for their homogeneous society and staunch isolationism, so its sure to garner attention from at least some of the Japanese populace as well. On top of all of that, the writers also portray a solid understanding of why the Sibyl System is so well-received by the fictional world&#039;s populace and subsequently satirize the pursuit of convenience, comfort, and security over personal freedom. Episode 4 did that the best with the elevator scene.<br />
<br />
Is this show perfect? Well, no, of course not; some characters stay rather underdeveloped relative to others, but as the show is progressing, more is learned about each of the new cast. Additionally, I enjoy how the plot and mystery further thickens as we learn more about each character, and this is especially true for episodes 4 and 5. That aside, I&#039;m not a big fan of how one of the main characters basically has a pair of superpowers considering how more-or-less realistic the rest of the show is. I also think that the pace is a bit slow in some scenes; if this show were in a more anime-standard 23-minute format, I would definitely feel that some episodes (excluding episode 4) were less action-packed than others. Perhaps the 46-minute format, in addition to even further evoking the feel of live-action TV police dramas, was meant to counter this, but because the characters are consistently entertaining and develop while simultaneously making good progress in their investigations, I&#039;m not really bothered by how there are often long stretches of time with nary an action scene in sight. This isn&#039;t new to Psycho-Pass, either, as season 1 had interesting philosophical discussion in addition to its stylized and entertaining characters. Season 3, I think, suffers from only having some philosophical discussion, but what is present, verbal and nonverbal alike, is well-received and make the show more worthwhile. I just wish there was more of it. Its biggest problem for me, however, is that it is FAR, FAR from complete. The final episode brings in a lot of new plot elements and, while I totally saw the post-credits scene coming, it still had me wanting to see what would come next. Too bad we have to wait God-knows-how-long to see a 4th season.<br />
<br />
Getting back to more positive aspects, when we do see action scenes, they tend to look very, very good, although, to be fair, episode 4 was rife with action to the point where some of it looked good, but other parts were a bit rough. In spite of this, it was clear to me since first seeing that list of the key animators&#039; names in the opening theme that this was a work that the staff were proud to present, because key animator names basically never appear in opening credits. They didn&#039;t even do that in Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. Freaking... KABANERI didn&#039;t do that!<br />
<br />
The music and sound design are also as good as ever in the franchise; Yugo Kanno is back on the soundtrack with an almost completely original composition. Don&#039;t worry, though; they aren&#039;t afraid to play season 1 music when it&#039;s right for the scene. Also, the voice acting is as solid as in previous entries; newcomers Yuki Kaji and Yuichi Nakamura feel right at home in this show, and even Junichi Suwabe and Mamoru Miyano join the cast! I was pleasantly surprised to find them here. I am, however, a bit disappointed that Funimation could not get the license to this show and dub it. I can only guess who they would cast in all the new roles. Oh well. Maybe someday. And before you raise your pitchforks and scream &quot;dubs should die&quot;, remember that some people are dyslexic and have trouble reading, or are unable to read as quickly as the subtitles demand them to; please be considerate of these individuals.<br />
<br />
All in all, in spite of its problems, Psycho-Pass 3 was a rather bright spot in a season that has left me rather disappointed for the most part. You don&#039;t NEED to have seen season 1 or the film to watch this show, but the juicy details and moments are present and fun to appreciate, even if they blatantly reskinned the famously climactic scene of &quot;Saint&#039;s Supper&quot; from season 1. This season did its job in engaging me and getting me to want more, but I can&#039;t help but feel a bit dissatisfied by how things didn&#039;t shake out at the end. Who is the man in the mask? What happened between the super-inspector&#039;s dad and the violent-inspector&#039;s brother? What proof does Sibyl have that Akane Tsunemori isn&#039;t criminally asymptomatic? All right, that last one is from me alone, but the point is none of these are answered. I don&#039;t know if there will be any kind of payoff in the future, and so I can&#039;t give this the original 8 out of 10 for which I had it pegged. A high 7 out of 10 (as opposed to a low 7) is in order: solidly entertaining, a slightly disappointing ending, but enough smarts to make it worth one&#039;s time, at least for one full watch.<br />
<br />
Happy Watching!<br />

    Psycho-Pass 3 is the latest installment in a long-standing franchise that continues to explore interesting concepts surrounding a unique technology in a dystopian future. This is done in a manner that allows the viewer to act as &quot;detective&quot; along with the protagonists, Arata Shindo and Kei Mikhail Ignatov, as they pursue their mission. The anime&#039;s best feature lie in the dynamics of those Inspectors and their team of Enforcers, all of whom are interesting and well-voiced. Ignatov&#039;s wife is a non-police character who provides an interesting backdrop to the work the police do. There are shortcomings, of course, and condensing the series into eight episodes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review322993">
        from the usual 10-13 is one as it forces the slower storytelling style of most anime, which fans appreciate, to lose cohesiveness. On the positive side, that choppiness creates tension, which investigative work engenders, pushing the characters forward. The up-side? Viewers are expected to play &quot;detective&quot; along with the characters instead of being spoon-fed and there is not a shred of shipper-y material anywhere to be found (without a huge stretch of the imagination). Instead, PP3 gives one a fly-on-the-wall point of view that, at times, is frustrating but also involves one emotionally without one realizing it until you are &quot;one&quot; with the protagonists. It is well worth your time.

    It&#039;s back, baby! Psycho-Pass is back in series format, and I couldn&#039;t be happier. I do think this is an appropriate time to tell you all that I messed up. I haven&#039;t seen the Sinners of the System movies, so some of what I say about this season may sound dumb because I missed 3 movies worth of background information (probably) that would&#039;ve helped me understand this season better.<br />
<br />
But we&#039;ll do what we can. Let&#039;s start with the art and sound. Now, objectively speaking, the art is Psycho-Pass is fairly average. I do think it does very well with the lighting effect and architecture, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323755">
        most everything else is standard. However, this art style is very familiar to me, and I enjoy it a lot. The character designs this season were gorgeous. The animation as well is killer. The fight scenes are?? Like?? They&#039;re kick-ass. The movements of the characters as well as the choreography just blew me away. I could feel weight behind the punches, and watching it always felt really good (same goes for the parkour). As far as sound goes, I&#039;d say this series excels in its BGM during high-paced scenes more than anything, but the music overall fit the tones of the series nicely. I feel the need to mention the amazing additions to the seiyuu cast this season because they did a hell of a job and brought the series new life that it hadn&#039;t had before.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the cast, let&#039;s talk about characters. Quite a few new faces were added to the roster this season, and honestly, I think it was a really smart move. Not because the old cast was tired or anything like that, but these characters and their personalities felt so unique in this world of Sybil. That&#039;s especially true for the two main characters. Their stories, both individually and together, combined with their attitudes toward the events of this season kept me insanely interested. I think they&#039;ve got a lot of depth to be explored, so I&#039;m excited to see what&#039;s done with the characters moving forward.<br />
<br />
The story is probably the main reason I&#039;ve given this season a nine rather than a ten. It&#039;s kind of like it&#039;s *just* done, you know? It&#039;s got all it needs to have to get a decent grade, but a few things were done a little weird. First of all, to talk about the merits of the story, it was planned out extremely well. The pacing for each episode on its own as well as between episodes felt organic and sensible. As for the story itself, the twists as well as the attainment of new information was done beautifully. I enjoyed watching the characters further their investigation because it was written so well. The hitch comes when we talk about the abstract nature of the storytelling in some places. At times, the story could be super specific and explanatory, and at others, it led the viewer to the answer in a roundabout way... but sometimes things just didn&#039;t make a whole lot of sense. It may just be me-- and it didn&#039;t happen very often-- but the plot got lost a few times. Some things I thought would probably be explained in a future season, but others I wasn&#039;t so sure about. It wasn&#039;t that big of a deal overall, though, because most of the story was told very well.<br />
<br />
All in all, I&#039;m very excited for Psycho-Pass to get rolling again. This season didn&#039;t overlap the previous cast with the new one too much, but I have the feeling that&#039;s really gonna change in the future, and that prospect pumps me up. I&#039;m just... really happy that this series is back, so I&#039;m gonna enjoy it for as long as I can.

    As I wrote in the first review of season 1; the intellectual level that contains the first work should have been maintained, this was of course the worst sequel of all.<br />
Each chapter made visual remembrances to the first season, terrible.<br />
The development was poor, the ridiculous bad comedy, the personality design of the characters was simply flat.<br />
They close with scenes that we all expected to see at some point to get hooked, bad resource.<br />
A disappointment.<br />
To all this, they plan to make a sequel with the poor material that they left of that ridiculous end?<br />
Undoubtedly, they ruined what began as an excellent original cyberpunk story (of course

Story- 3<br />
It&#039;s really sad to have one of my favorite anime of all time (psycho pass season 1) end up like this. The first few episodes set up some interesting things but the series quickly goes to shit. Season 3 is convoluted and messy because it spreads itself out much too thin by constantly introducing new characters that have flimsy connections to the main story. It doesn&#039;t present the interesting themes that made the original so good nor does it bring any new themes to the table, except for touching on the treatment of immigrants and even that&#039;s weakly developed. The story is also

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323349">
        very frustrating to watch at times because a system whose supposed goal is absolute utilitarianism is awfully bogged down in bureaucracy. In the first season, what&#039;s perceived as initial bureaucracy turns out to be just the Sibyl system protecting itself and trying to perfectly manipulate all the other characters, but in season 3, its just a plot device to hamper the main characters. Also crime coefficient at this point doesn&#039;t even need to exist because nothing in the story builds off that plot device. So other than some returning characters and existing in the same universe, it basically shares nothing with previous entries. And that&#039;s fine except its bad as a standalone piece as well.<br />
<br />
Characters: 4<br />
The two main characters are likable and have a mysterious backstory but the rest of characters are really quite boring. All the enforcers this time around have no standout or interesting personalities or backstories. The villains are comically bad and constantly say things that scream , &quot;I&#039;m evil&quot; with no subtlety. It&#039;s just really lazy and a shortcut to making actually interesting and realistic antagonists. <br />
<br />
Art/ Sound: 7 / 4<br />
The Animation is not consistent but not bad either, the sound track is pretty meh and the background art is just the same as all the other psycho passes. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5<br />
I think there&#039;s value in making spin off stories that don&#039;t add anything thematically or story wise, because its good fun for fans of the series (Sinners of the System movies), but when you&#039;re not building off of pieces that have been proven to work to appeal to fans, shouldn&#039;t you at least bring some new themes and ideas to the table? At least the movies showed what the world outside of Japan was like and that kept it interesting to some degree. But Season 3? It&#039;s just a poorly done detective story that happens to take place in the same universe as previous seasons. The story is more confusing than interesting and the characters are boring and unoriginal. It&#039;s less entertaining than the Sinners of the System movies so if you just wanna watch more psycho pass stuff just go watch that. Season 3 sorely disappointed me and if you&#039;re a fan of psycho pass it&#039;ll disappoint you too.

    The third season of Psycho Pass did a solid job of getting somewhat back to its roots. After Season 2, which was a step down for the series in my opinion, they managed to get back on track with season three, with a few gripes here and there, of course.<br />
<br />
The main inspectors of this season, are Kei and Arata, who make up a loveable tandem. The former being an immigrant in a time period, where immigrants are looked down on heavily, and the latter, being a mentalist, who is able to trace memories of people, and areas. Kei acts as Aratas keeper, as he generally

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323776">
        needs help returning to his senses when he starts doing a mental trace.<br />
<br />
Psycho Pass 3 does a solid job of introducing new characters that fit the bill, while keeping longtime viewers tied over on the occasional appearances of characters from the previous two seasons. Namely Kogami, Ginoza, and Tsunemori.<br />
<br />
The plot was gripping, and kept me entertained throughout the 45 minute sessions, with a grand total of 8 episodes. With that being said, and the content withstanding, this season felt incomplete to me. Almost like they ran out of time, or budget, and didn&#039;t have enough content to wrap everything up neatly, or get to what I can only assume, was the target of 24 episodes. So, instead, they did 8 longer episodes.<br />
<br />
Even still, the last episode didn&#039;t really resolve much of anything. Spoilers ahead, if you haven&#039;t fully watched this yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure, Kei managed to get his wife out of holding, what becomes of him now, that he&#039;s an inspector of Bifrost? How does this conflict with his friendship with Arata, or his position in the Public Safety Bureau?<br />
<br />
Speaking of Bifrost, those lunatics are still out there causing mayhem... And to be honest, it didn&#039;t feel like they were even remotely close to solving the case concerning Bifrost.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m expecting another season of Psycho Pass, and I&#039;m hoping it&#039;ll come sooner than later, because there are an awful lot of questions I&#039;d like to get some answers to.<br />
<br />
<br />
All in all, I give Psycho Pass 3 - an 8/10. Better than season two, but still not quiet up to par with the first season. Here&#039;s to hoping Season 4, whenever that comes, is a step forward, and not a step back.

    PSYCHO-PASS 3&#039;s gambit is an initially promising one, a soft reboot with a cast of fresh faces and a new attitude with respect to its approach to thrills and stakes. Those who found previous seasons&#039; penchant for cheap shock-value in the form of exploitative violence will probably find the slower and more politically-driven nature of this season to be refreshing, with maybe only two or three people meeting a messy demise at the end of a Dominator. Our inspectors seem to prefer ye olde fisticuffs in their dealings with the Sybil-defying underbelly of Tokyo instead, impractical as it is. <br />
<br />
Despite all this, PSYCHO-PASS 3 has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323882">
        very little of interest going on. The new inspectors are likable enough but don&#039;t add much to the proceedings. Arata Shindo has a cliche eccentric personality, quasi-supernatural &quot;mentalist&quot; abilities, and improbable intuitions that spoil the procedural setups. Kei Ignatov is the more stern and serious of the two, a family man. You&#039;ve seen this stuff before. The overarching villains are opaque in their goals and methods. You get the sense they are finger-tenting puppetmasters and not much else. The animation and direction are as perfunctory as ever. Be prepared for lots of conventional scenes of talking, interrogating, and investigating. This all has the veneer of an intelligent procedural, but it is hollow. <br />
<br />
Worse, the story is hardly finished by the end of the eighth episode and comes with lots of additional story threads hanging here and there, a number of them involving what the old members of Unit One have been up to. This makes this season feel no more consequential than the SS movies or really anything we&#039;ve gotten out of PSYCHO-PASS since the first season. It&#039;s just another piece of the franchise puzzle with no clear sense of purposeful evolution.

    Looks like you can sell anything with brand names today.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve just wasted 6 hours of my life thanks to this average anime baiting me in with the Psycho-pass title. Maybe I could take it if it advertised itself as a spinoff - which it really is - but the fact that it dares to masquerade as a sequel is just downright shameful and ridiculous. This is an average crime story which doesn&#039;t even try to or fails miserably at continuing with the themes and good qualities of its predecessors, which is unacceptable from a supposed sequel.<br />
<br />
It doesn&#039;t deal with questions of morality and society in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323837">
        any meaningful way, has no charismatic characters or emotional intensity. Instead we get an average detective story with cliché cyberpunk themes we&#039;ve seen a hundred times thrown in like immigrants, politics, a huge behind the shadows conspiracy, and boring, cookie-cutter characters from the current crime story trends. Add to this the edgy, fanfiction quality writing that tries to pretend it deals with meaningful themes by throwing in random, unfitting monologues about them every once in a while. I won&#039;t even get started about the retarded mentalist abilities with 0 explanation, which also makes no sense at all in the Psycho-pass world btw.<br />
<br />
And on top of this all, somehow they ended the season without doing anything meaningful with the setting or the character at all, they literally cut without anything interesting happening, and dared to end with a garbage cliffhanger after all this. I would probably give this a 5 if it weren&#039;t selling itself as a Psycho-pass sequel, but this is just unacceptable for me.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not even gonna watch anything Psycho-pass related in the future, unless Urobuchi is writing it. Fooled once, never again.

    I am a big fan of the Psycho-pass series and manga. <br />
<br />
I figued it would be best to clearly state this in the beginning instead of casually bringing it up at the end. <br />
<br />
This series is not over, but I plan to come back to this review and add to it once it is over seeing as I am posting this now at a halfway point. <br />
<br />
Psycho-pass three is much better than psycho-pass two in the sense that if you have not watched the first season you might not fully understand the vocabulary or specifics...but you&#039;ll be able to fully understand what is happening in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323145">
        the story. <br />
<br />
Actually, it is almost as if PP3 tried to avoid some of the biggest issues people had with PP2. For example, some people had issues with the &quot;constant point and shoot&quot;. This time...we have a character who likes &quot;old school&quot; detective work. Another issue was unnecessary dialouge. In the third season, instead of spending 10 minutes essentially giving viewers a tutorial on how to use a fictional weapon...we focus instead on the plot, character, and weapons when it relates to the plot. <br />
<br />
<br />
The third season also brings together the characters. In the second season it seemed like everything fell apart without really explaining what would happen to the characters...let alone society itself. This is what i thought would bug me the most...however it fits very well with everyones specific personality..<br />
<br />
Finally, for my halfway review...the new character is very interesting and adds something new to this fictional world. Maybe it isn&#039;t absolutely amazing but it is really entertaining and i wish more shows had this genre. <br />

    Three episodes in, I was ready to declare Pyscho-Pass 3 an excellent season of one of my favorite shows. The music was good, the animation was beautiful, fight scenes were complex and brutal, the new cast of characters were starting to grow on me and cameos from the old characters gave some of them more opportunities to shine than they had in the past two seasons (plus the movies). I was really digging it.<br />
<br />
Then about halfway through, I noticed a slight dip in the animation quality. The fight scenes became more sporadic and rushed. The dominators only came out a handful of times. And while

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323901">
        I appreciate getting a different perspective on the world of Psycho-Pass compared to the previous seasons, stories about real estate scams and election rigging just don&#039;t capture one&#039;s attention like stories of lunatics and serial killers. The first two seasons bordered on horror in some places, and there was legitimate tension that a main character could die at any moment. <br />
<br />
For the most part, that tension is gone in the third season. By the final episode, the characters and situation may have certainly developed, but so many story threads are left dangling, teasing another season. I like a good cliffhanger as much as the next guy, but it feels like there&#039;s no meaningful denouement here at all, and that&#039;s unfortunate.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.<br />
<br />
I’ll just be upfront about it, Psycho-Pass was never good. No, not even the first season. It has repeatedly solidified itself as a pseudo-intellectual entry with only pretensions to the truth as written by the hack writer known as Urobuchi whose writing technique is a session of confidence tricks. Though, even among the collective that disagrees with these notions, there is an air of ambivalence to the subsequent additions into the Psycho-Pass universe, with this new season only adding on to the pile. Though I believe this installment to be the best in the series and had a promising start, it is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323765">
        unable to deal with its own story and contributes to a never-ending series that shouldn&#039;t have existed to begin with.<br />
<br />
Pulling away from the previous shows, Psycho-Pass 3 starts with a mostly all-new cast and a fresh outlook on the world. The positions of returning main characters have been seemingly retconned and turned on it’s head in a very odd way in between the movie and this particular show. Kougami goes from international terrorist leader against the Sibyl system to working as an investigator for them, while Akane is an imprisoned political activist working outside the Sibyl system. The change into this new cast is a promising change as Urobuchi has never been good at writing characters nor their interpersonal relationships and neither has anyone been good at attempting to do so with Urobuchi’s character setups. Alongside this, after two shows and a movie, they finally realized that in a NOIR-ISH SCI-FI WITH A DYSTOPIAN SETUP, it might be best to focus on macropolitics, the socio-political implications of the world, and implement the actual police procedural process into the overarching story rather than focus on character drama. <br />
	<br />
Although there is still character drama, it’s woven into the story though itself feeling underwhelming and melodramatic. The allusions to Arata’s father are too on the nose and “small world” while the forced incorporation of Kei’s wife into the conflict turns into a melodramatic romp that feels rather pathetic when he’s saved by Gino and his foreign affairs division. What makes Psycho-Pass 3 unique when compared to the rest however is how it handles its politics, or really that it actually handles the politics at all. Immigration, the political ramifications of the Sibyl system on a democratic environment, how this system feeds into a deep state of wealthy bankers, gun restrictions, democracy subverted by the system’s deep state, domestic terrorism, and special religious zones. All of which should have been issues to be developed in the previous shows that were not.<br />
	<br />
The way in which these issues are dealt with are rather nuanced leading into a rather vague final answer. There is care to be shown to immigrants wanting to escape the conditions of their home country, yet this issue is also being exploited by interest groups for cheap labor. Much like many countries in real life, anti-isolationist (pro-immigration) groups champion for the rights of immigrants to enter the country, yet not their once they get in. It’s all a ploy by the system to exploit for labor and political gain, with candidates on an anti-isolationist platform given the election by the system’s deep state and its exploitative bend. The solution? Well, in Psycho-Pass tradition it throws an issue at you but then doesn’t offer a possible solution, or the solution it does offer doesn’t actually solve anything. Of course, it inevitably handles the Sibyl system in this way. In the first season, Akane went full Suzaku mode and proclaimed she’d “fix the system from the inside” as opposed to armed revolution which was depicted as a “morally wrong” thing to do, despite this being aimed at a very obviously corrupt system. Then, much like Suzaku she proceeded to assist the system in its exploitation and murder while never actually solving the problem she set out to tackle in the first place.<br />
	<br />
We see the same here regarding the system, at first not as direct and in your face about it but falling into the trappings as before all the same by the end. This the eternal problem with the series which, different writers or not, it has not been able to tackle properly. The ramifications of its plot are fundamentally too nuanced to draw up any proper solution without controversy, and the writers are ill-equipped to deal with that. It shows angles and themes that point to the system being very clearly bad in multiple ways from its control of justice to it being actually corrupted from the inside, and especially in the first season was it shown as so. Yet it bounces back to the system being necessary. So it plays it safe, aiming for a “reformist” line of thinking, which has given me an infinite source of disappointment. We are presented with a corrupt and exploitative authoritarian police state, yet it will constantly view and display an armed revolution, the only way of rooting out the system, against it as morally wrong, and its participants “misguided.” Makishima was not a “good guy” but he was ideologically a preferable alternative, and the only reason he gets seen as a bad guy is because of Urobuchi forcing him to be a serial killer so NOW he becomes morally wrong. If he wasn’t, he’d be undebatably superior to a reformist angle that he wished to push without real legitimacy.<br />
	<br />
In our third installment, we see Kurisu O’Brien take stage as the armed antagonist to the system, though the writing is certainly sympathetic to him as Arata offers him compassion and understanding, he is still portrayed as misguided. Why should we view this way? Arata okay’s the actions of a puppet to the system who herself exploited the people under a systematic metric more than a revolutionary out to turn the tide against that indisputably corrupt system, and it’s now bad because his own persona vendetta of revenge came into play for such an act? Then of course, it turns into a reformist angle, instead aiming to remove the “blind spots” of the system rather than systematically change society for the better. Despite this series attempting to come off as Dystopian, it seems to love this system, as we and the populace are treated to the idea that the system is the entire reason that the country is stable compared to the rest of the world stuck in a perpetual civil war and uprising. Does it portray this as propagandizing? No, it seems to agree with this. As if the system of the PRC should be hand-waved as “not the best” but still, look at all those countries who aren’t so well off! We should be grateful for this system! Reform it from the inside if it gets bad!<br />
	<br />
You don’t even have to defend the system, just make something where the characters are forced to deal with the current world as is (like Blade Runner), yet it refuses this. It attempts to justify the system with the inclusion of Bifrost as not a consequence of the system, but the system a victim of their reign. The proof of this is that they supposedly predate the system or that they technically aren’t an official part of it, and this is a completely idiotic excuse. An authoritarian system that decides things in such a way will always come to be exploited by the wealthy, and the wealthy will always predate any system that is put into place. If your system cannot deal with either of those, it is not an efficient system in working for the people. It even dictates who and who doesn’t need government-assigned therapy, which will always be an extremely bad idea and morally wrong. Bifrost is interesting and has some cool sequences with its odd gambling game, though functionally it feels like a diet version of the Illuminati from Deus Ex, so just play that instead.<br />
	<br />
Because a system that is so brutally efficient that it measures it’s people according to their “hues” and deals with them according to it instead of individuals is supposedly so good at keeping things stable, we should keep this system in place and just rely on people always being there to “reform it” if it gets bad. Why? Because the alternative would be possibly less stable. At the very least, this new season did real world building and actually showed the intricacies of how the Sibyl system affected the political system as a whole along with the very obvious issue of this world which would come into play, that being Immigration. That’s more than I can say about all the other iterations before. Really, it’s the best you’re going to get out of this world when presented with hack writers every season, and it doesn’t help that they continue to hang on to the old characters, bringing them back for the final stretch of the show. Plenty of scenes where Kougami show up are just annoying fan service and I never liked Akane. She’s the quintessential “naïve idealist” that Urobuchi loves to write. Don’t even get me started on the YA-novel tier of writing in regard to the “criminally asymptomatic” across this entire franchise.<br />
	<br />
There are other issues with the story itself though, like Arata’s mental trace ability being a convenient MacGuffin both for the investigation and the whole backstory with his father that ties into the overarching plot. The weird incorporation of exaggerated anime faces and reactions for some humor bit comes across as out of place. Kei and Arata’s backstory into their relationship also feels melodramatic and Kei’s wife especially is really exploited for emotional points. In the end, it’s just SAC Lite, much like how the series always really was. At the very least they finally figured out exactly what made the world of SAC interesting but couldn’t replicate it. It would’ve been best for everyone if this series ended at the first season, even if this is legitimately the best season of the show. Cope harder Urobuchi fans.<br />

    Awfully unbalanced, to say the least. This installment could have gone in so many better directions, yet we´ve ended up with a shallow follow-up that only echoes back the days of Psycho-Pass&#039; greatness when the characters from the old set-up show up.<br />
There is no suspense as it gets lost in the pile of dialogues that introduce loads of plots that don&#039;t get to be properly developed anyway. There&#039;s no emotional connection to the characters growing as they&#039;re given no importance, contrasted with background global affairs that are supposed to be the main plot. And then, when all the pieces of the puzzle come together (around

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323469">
        7th episode) we don&#039;t feel invested nor moved whatsoever, feeling that we didn&#039;t get to know them at all, neither do we care about the fate of the world depicted in the series. The only likable character here is Kei, who gets only slightly better treatment from the writer than the rest of the cast.<br />
Other than that, it&#039;s just boring and long-winded. The only things that keep it all in place are, of course, Kanno&#039;s music and outstanding animation. But they won&#039;t make up for the mistreated textual layer. Well, unfortunately that&#039;s exactly what happens when you get caught up in the grandeur of politics, global affairs and masterminds. I suppose it was bound to happen at some point...

    I&#039;ll be very short about this, better than season 2, still not as good as season 1. I understand that not many people are as interested in Psycho-Pass as they were when it first came out. Almost an entirely new cast (which i was a bit wary about) except for a few old faces. Surprisingly, the main protagnists were replaced in this season. Hopefully in the next season we see a lot more of the OG cast. It was alright, not too special. I liked the OP.<br />
At times the animation got super bad but im happy to say that the more intense action scenes were

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323889">
        well animated in comparison. The new characters are nice but for some reason I just can&#039;t get myself to like Maiko, her eyes and features just creep me out. <br />
If you&#039;re a fan of Psycho-pass i would implore you to watch this season, however if you just want to jump into the series through this season, try season 1 instead.

    Note: This is a &quot;SPOILER-FREE&quot; review. <br />
<br />
<br />
Intro:<br />
<br />
After years of waiting and the smooth transition created by the ending of Case 3, we finally get the latest entry in the franchise: Psycho-Pass 3. <br />
<br />
The time has come, once again, for the series&#039; lifelong fans to get excited after what was a very poor performance from Season 2 as the 3rd mainline entry brings much promise with an entirely new cast of characters, story, and newer events. <br />
<br />
Will it outdo the brilliance of the S1 masterpiece? Can it even hold a candle to what is ultimately the defining standard of the entire franchise in S1? The answer:

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415577">
        Yes AND No.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
<br />
Psycho-Pass 3, for all intents and purposes, is an entirely new/ different/ fresh approach (Depending on your perspective) to the world of Psycho-Pass. The series takes place 7 years after the events of Season 1 (Even the release dates for both seasons are approximately 7 years apart, which is a cool tidbit). What makes Psycho-Pass 3 stand out from the previous entries is its focus on world-building; many new aspects of the Psycho-Pass world are explored in-depth and the focus is taken away from the things that were a highlight in most of the previous entries. And it is as it should be as Sibyl continues to evolve.<br />
<br />
This opens up the series, explores more of the Psycho-Pass world, breaks the monotony in the series, and invites the viewer to think with a brand new perspective... that is if they want to. The series dares to venture outside of its usual formula that was perfected by Season 1, close to destroyed by Season 2, and somewhat redeemed by the movie and Sinners of the System.<br />
<br />
So, with a completely different approach, does Psycho-Pass 3 work? Apparently, it does and it does so very well. The reason I say this is because it focuses on multiple new aspects and world exploration that S1 or future entries never did. You could say that it wasn&#039;t needed for S1 to begin with as it was a complete series from start to finish, which is totally fine. However, this is where Psycho-Pass 3 excels as far as the comparison goes with S1 and other entries. And this is what stood out to me the MOST in Psycho-Pass 3.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
<br />
If you ever wanted to be a detective or wanted to pretend to be one and solve mysteries and crimes, then you can best believe that that is EXACTLY what Psycho-Pass 3 is going to ask of you. The story has a nice slow pace that truly gives a sense of &#039;The calm before the storm&#039; kind of build-up intensity. Every dialogue, every word, the opening, the ending, the character interactions, and every development will lead you closer to the overall truth and make you see the overall picture. By no means is it S1 level of story-telling and writing, but it isn&#039;t a trainwreck like S2 either. But the story still manages to be pretty good and intriguing. You will find yourself confused at times and that is to be expected as Psycho-Pass IS complex. Thinking too deep could even cloud your hue, to be honest...<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
<br />
The art is great; you can expect the same brilliance in art as is to be expected of this franchise and what it has given us over the years.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
<br />
*Chef&#039;s Kiss* When it GOT going, it GOT going.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment &amp; Overall: 9/10<br />
<br />
I thoroughly enjoyed this one. The crimes were legit intriguing and suspenseful. The slow and menacing build-up to the overall bigger picture kept me on the edge of my seat. Although -1 point for taking complexity to the next level, I really appreciate the creative team for taking a different and what I thought to be was a very intriguing approach to the franchise as a whole.
