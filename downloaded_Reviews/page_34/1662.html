    “Um, m-marriage is where your life goes to drink.” <br />
When I first saw this anime while browsing for brand new anime releases, this anime came into view. My first thoughts…  Probably just one of those cliché anime comedy romances. Well I got the comedy romance part right, but the cliché part I couldn’t have been any more wrong. Forgive me Otaku God for calling this anime cliché *goes on hands and knees* The jokes are quite fresh and new, and the romance is so adorable your most likely going to die from potential blood loss coming out of your nose. <br />
<br />
Plot: <br />
The plot is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review61067">
        quite simple beyond beliefs; there is no complexity about it in anyway. Even a five year old can understand it. The anime is about the love between two high schoolers, and what fate awaits them. Well to put it simply all you’re watching is Io and Tsumiki’s relationship grow each and every episode, while at the same time, watching the other characters bug the heck out the both of them, mostly Tsumiki though.  Even though this anime requires no extreme thought into understanding what the fudge it’s about, this anime is probably the only anime of its kind that has a perfect way of displaying plot development. Each and every episode, it shows a subtle amount of growth in a relationship from grabbing onto a coat to feeding your lover a spoonful of delicious goodness. This anime just isn’t about romance though; it also does a heck of a good job of making me choke from the amount of laughter produced. Sure not every part of this anime is so funny that it’s enough to make Grumpy from Snow White laugh, but hey I betcha a quarter that he would sniffle a giggle. Which means, whether you’re a Happy or a Grumpy you’re definitely going to laugh, giggle, snort, or even nose bleed when watching this comedy romance filled Heaven! <br />
<br />
Characters: <br />
Soon to be lovers, Io and Tsumiki are the ideal anime couple of 2012 with their excellent way of showing character development! Each and every episode, one way or another, shows some tiny sign of character development which is definitely one of Acchi Kocchi’s proud strong points. Their budding relationship is so cute that it even puts Kamichama Karin’s Kazune and Karin’s adorable relationship to shambles! Now why don’t we highlight the extraordinary features of these soon to be lovers? Tsumiki is not your average tsundere, unlike most tsunderes she has that cool and collective attitude that boys go crazy for, however that’s not all; she has her cute side too which proves it with those kawaii cat ears that pop up now and again.  Tsumiki is also a fantastic cook, adorable singer, and a super strong woman. There’s no doubt that she’s the ideal woman for most men! Now last but not least let us introduce the one the only, Io Otanoshi! Io may be quite oblivious to many things, but he makes up for it with those devilish good looks and charm that the Gods and Goddesses of Anime had blessed him with. Io like Tsumiki, is also a fantastic cook, but that’s not all, he’s also got the skills of a ninja! He’s every woman’s dream man! But that’s not at all, Acchi Kocchi also has Hime Haruno our nose bleeding princess, Sakaki the awesome pevert who is strangely similar to Yohei Sunohara, and Mayoi Katose the strange girl with a knack for technology. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
If there is one thing I have learned from watching countless  anime shows with a variety of different and yet unique art styles, I have come to the conclusion that the art style used in an anime should somehow fit the plot and genre of the anime. For example, in a horror anime, you need a somewhat mysterious and dark feel which will cause the hearts of its viewer a feel of slight uneasiness.  In this case, however, you have a romance comedy anime with its goal being to somehow cause the hearts and souls of its viewers a feeling of relaxation, happiness, laughter, and adoration. To successfully put all these wonderful feelings together the animators had used an art style similar to that of Lucky Star’s. However, that is not all; the animators had also used graphics, effects, and the hearts and souls of those who love cute things too not only woo their viewers into a zombie like state in which people will stare adoringly at their computer screen, but also a near death experience where the viewer’s soul have somehow died and gone to a world of pure bliss. <br />
<br />
Music: <br />
“I don’t know anything about the meaning of love; I just want to look at you all the time.” That my anime friends are a small part of the cutesy lyrics to the anime’s opening “Acchi de Kocchi de.” Like most openings to animes the lyrics somehow in some way relate to the anime’s plot, cutesy and romantic for this one. The voice actors used in this anime are in no doubt, specialists. These seiyuus had successfully and utterly pulled down the red carpet and walked dazzlingly across it smilingly handsomely at all those other rejected seiyuus and said, “Tough luck kids, maybe next time.” Very unbelievable if I do say so myself that a few voice actors could be as so professional as to pull off the stupidity, cuteness, embarrassment, and all those other fanciful adjectives I type randomly just to make this paragraph longer. “If I grin and nyaa, I’ll know you’ll scratch my back.” And that was just extremely adorable lyrics to the anime’s ending song &quot;Te wo Gyu Shite ne” which is just as adorable and pleasant as Tsumiki with her cat ears which I know most people are as so tempted to pull. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: <br />
If there is one thing I wanted to do after watching episode one of this anime, it was to dance around in my underwear like a strange lunatic while smiling and listening to anime music. If you are wondering if I have problems than yes, yes I do. But that does not change the fact that this anime is so wonderful that every Otaku will get up and scream of joy, while watching Tsumiki go moe on them! I also got into the strange habit of saying cat like things; I have the strange urge to do so. But yes if you want me to get right into the point than yes, yes I 100% did enjoy watching this anime, so much that I want to dance happily in my own little world where my crush will someday pat me in the head lovingly and feed me a spoonful of food. My gosh, I’m sure every girl wants their crush to do that to them! Don’t worry ladies, I’m sure someday your prince will come.<br />

    Normally someone wouldn&#039;t even bother to look at an anime that admits to have cliched characters in its synopsis. Nowadays, I normally wouldn&#039;t even touch an anime that looks like it could turn into a harem. However, the cover of Acchi Kocchi just attracted my attention so much that I just couldn&#039;t resist its cuteness. No one can. Thus, I started to watch the first episode, having low expectation and knowing it could turn into a horrible school harem. Upon finishing the first episode however, I found myself an easy-going little comedy gem.<br />
<br />
The plot usually starts off with the main male character Io meeting up

          <span style="display: none;" id="review58091">
        with his female friend, Tsumiki, who waits for him in different, but seemingly familiar settings. They then walk together somewhere, meeting up with friends on the way while committing some mischief throughout the episode. However, what&#039;s different about this series than most school dramas is that the setting changes I would say consistently, which makes it more interesting to watch. Also, the characters may be archetypes, but they&#039;re hilarious. <br />
<br />
Tsumiki is perhaps the coolest main character ever; she can beat guys at video games, has a feminine side, and  cat ears. Tsumiki definitely reminds me of lucky star as well as Toradora, she almost seems like shy version of Taiga with cat ears. Then there&#039;s Io, who I&#039;m not going to go into details about since there&#039;s not much known about him, but he&#039;s definitely a very kind person and Tsumiki obviously likes him. Thus, a compassionate romance is bound to happen, but a fatuous relationship isn&#039;t out of question either.<br />
<br />
All the side characters are archetypes: the Pervy male sidekick, &quot;single&quot; teacher, air headed females, nose-bleeding characters, etc. But wait, all of them in a single series? Yep, all the archetypes are included in one single series. So now you can have deja vu about almost every cliched characters every time you watch this series! But don&#039;t get me wrong, instead of being annoying, I&#039;d say most of the side characters are pretty funny. If taken out of contexts, their actions just seem like a bunch of teenagers&#039; rebellious acts, but within the context, it&#039;s almost like a well-scripted stand up comedy show. <br />
<br />
The art was definitely cute and that&#039;s all there really is to say about it. It&#039;s got beautiful designs, and the characters all have something special about them. What more could you ask for in a comedy series like this one? And like I said before some of the characters looked really similar to those in lucky star, so if you liked lucky star, do look into this series. Also, good thing there was music in the series and that it flowed pretty well with the fluent voice acting. Nothing too lyrically genius, but definitely soothing background music.<br />
<br />
Overall, with all these elements combined together, this show illustrates a great comedy anime. The characters were so entertaining that one may find themselves in a dazzling entrancement. If you watch this show while looking for a serious drama of some sort, then you&#039;ll be disappointed. If you watch this series open-minded while looking for perhaps a lighthearted school drama, you&#039;d be impressed at the results. Acchi kocchi definitely appealed to its audience throughout this series and is a quality example of how relaxing a comedy series could be.

    Acchi Kocchi, the anime adaptation from yonkoma manga (4 cell/panel manga) that begin aired around 2012. Several words that came up to describe it are funny, cute and adorable! How the story goes that sometimes make me laugh out loud because of its joke in it, all those cute, adorable and memorable character are the reason that Acchi Kocchi is worth to watch for all of you who really enjoy gag anime and a little bit of daily life romance in school. Although, there are several reasons for me why I give it fair. Specifically, I will explain it below:<br />
<br />
(*) Story<br />
How the story told in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review193267">
        process consist of two part in one episode, there&#039;s Part A and Part B. Most of it linked to one another, but there&#039;s several episode was not. The story itself is simple like most love stories, there&#039;s a girl who falls in love with a guy though their personality is cross apart but somehow they could make romance situation filled with sweetness aura. I don&#039;t know how to describe it specifically, but besides the simple and mainstream story, it surely gives us an expression of moe that makes the audience feel relax and enjoy the story. The other points, the romance itself has a small percentage compared to its joke or comedy. For the ending, I would like to say that it&#039;s not certainly enough to me for say that is a good ending, but I would not say that is a bad ending either. For all, I would say that is fair enough and could interest to watch for the very beginning till the end of the episode.<br />
<br />
(*) Art<br />
The art is good enough. It&#039;s from gag manga, after all, the creator may need it to expand their story and character as flexible it can to make the audience not bored and enjoy. Though, those efforts don&#039;t work on several condition. But, it is memorable and fit the story. I&#039;d like to say that it&#039;s cute art.<br />
<br />
(*) Sound<br />
I love the seiyuu, the OP and ED theme and a little touch of back sound that give us a fit sense to watch this anime. The character voice of Rumi Okubo fits Tsumiki well, same as Nobuhiko Okamoto who fits Io too. I just love them all! And somehow I liked Kyouya voice too, it&#039;s cool rather than the others. The opening and ending are good and fit the story. It&#039;s a good job for this point!<br />
<br />
(*) Character<br />
The character is memorable enough. Tsumiki the tsundere girl, Io the cool guy, Mayoi, and Sakaki are the duos who enjoy teasing and make pranks and last but not least is the innocent adorable character, Hime-chan. The characters don&#039;t have any specific development till the end of the stories. But it well received for this anime because of the storyline and for the fact, the characters from the story itself that the reason this anime is different than others. It’s unique and everyone want to adore them. Like Tsumiki and Hime for example, I want to pinch and own them if they really exist!! That kind of expression that makes Acchi Kocchi is memorable with its cuteness.<br />
<br />
(*) Enjoyment<br />
I got bored while I watched it, maybe because of the same story concept that appears in several times, but despite it, I watched Acchi Kocchi till the very end. It because somehow I like the characters that available in the story and the soundtrack that make me want to singing it with copying Io and Tsumiki voice till I got tired myself. In conclusion, it could somehow make me want to watch it more and it fair enough to watch for all of you who like that kind of genre with a little unique, cuteness and moe characters.<br />

    I usually see myself as a laid-back person more than anything. Because of that, the genre-less genre of &quot;slice of life&quot; appealed to me. With that eager and naive mindset, I dove head first into the world of...well...ordinary life. I first began with &#039;&quot;Lucky Star&quot;, but the overwhelming amount of references was beyond my knowledge. I then tried &quot;Nichijou&quot;, but despite it&#039;s charm, I didn&#039;t feel that &quot;love at first sight&quot; spark. With that being my interpretation of this genre, I casually shied away.<br />
Somewhere down the line, I found &quot;Acchi Kocchi&quot;. I was somewhat reluctant due to my earlier experiences, but something about the cover

          <span style="display: none;" id="review107375">
        image enticed me into at least giving it a shot. I&#039;ve had pleasant experiences with romance tags, and this anime happened to have one also. &quot;Just do it.&quot; as Nike would say.<br />
And so I did. Somehow, I feel so undeserving to have enjoyed this anime because of my earlier doubts.<br />
This anime made me question why &quot;Clannad&quot; or &quot;Chuu2byou&quot;, albeit being quite enjoyable, had the slice of life tag. I mean, drama hidden or masked underneath a supposed regular life is still in essence a drama, right? Enter, &quot;Acchi Kocchi&quot;. Absolutely no dramatic overhaul, yet still somehow a precious gem.<br />
Allow me to explain.<br />
<br />
Story/Content - 8<br />
Ah, I don&#039;t know. &quot;Story&quot; seems like an unfair way to rank this anime, given it&#039;s not really the goal here. There&#039;s no drama or intense feeling for the characters. Plot twists are quite simply non-existent. However, it&#039;s completely made up for (perhaps even more so) with what the creators have given us instead. It&#039;s about a group of five high school friends (With one potential unrequited lover) going about their everyday lives. Of course, there are certain out-of-the-ordinary mishaps to make it interesting, but I don&#039;t believe that&#039;s what makes it stand out to me. What I really found interesting was the way the creators make out-of-the-ordinary ordinary (Read that over a couple times), in a way that I don&#039;t believe I&#039;ve seen before. Basically, all the out of the strangeness is in the heads of the cast. Thinking and imagining is normal, right? Virtually all the blasphemy happens in the character&#039;s heads. The animators have so graciously animated their wild imaginations. Needless to say, HILARIOUS! The complete randomness and extravagance of their thoughts always left me crying of laughter. Most, if not all the jokes are fresh, and not reused very often other than I do realise this may fit under the &quot;characters&quot; section of my review, but alas, I felt as though the character&#039;s thoughts ARE the plot, and should be mentioned as so.The episodes are split into two ten minute segments highlighting a certain event of their lives. I can&#039;t say they&#039;re really quite linear even with slight references back to previous episodes, meaning you could start anywhere and still appreciate it. Some might be depreciative of the lack of originality in creating the story, so I&#039;d give it an 8.<br />
<br />
Art - 9<br />
I&#039;m a sucker for bright and colourful. The cute art style is part of what led me to watch this anime to begin with. I have to say, it&#039;s quite interesting and fresh. The overall tone is bright and colourful. Simple character designs perfectly suit character personalities. Scenery and such are usually brighter colours than they should be, and sometimes backgrounds are filled with bubbly patterns. I really want to mention the transition scenes though. Usually they&#039;re just simple movement animation over a single coloured background, but it&#039;s quite appealing. You&#039;d have to see for yourself. Obviously, the art doesn&#039;t aim for realism. It aims to create and support a cheerful, relaxing atmosphere, and does that outstandingly. Animation isn&#039;t astounding, but rather doesn&#039;t stand out. Really, the art is just a pleasure to look at. Though, I guess it doesn&#039;t appeal to everyone, so I&#039;ll bump it down to a 9.<br />
<br />
Sound - 8<br />
The opening and ending songs are rather cute and catchy, though I must admit, I didn&#039;t really listen to them often. They do gain points for being in perfect correlation with the mood of the anime though. Perhaps it&#039;s not meant to be a needle in your heart that stays with you forever, but a relaxing, overly cheerful, pop tune. The bells and whistles (literally) during the transition scenes are very suiting, and emphasize certain things as they should. Voices perfectly suit their characters, making the atmosphere all the more real. Tsumiki&#039;s quiet, shy voice and Io&#039;s cool, sexy voice are things I&#039;ll never forget. I can&#039;t say I can really distinguish any of the OSTs from the anime, but they blend well. In a nutshell, all the sounds build perfectly towards the atmosphere, but aren&#039;t much standalone.<br />
<br />
Character - 9<br />
A very colourful cast we have here (Literally and figuratively). As mentioned before, these characters ARE the plot. Their wild imaginations and attitudes is what makes this show a show. I can&#039;t say that they have original personalities, but I can confidently say that their personalities are a new spin on an ageing old. Basically, take some of the most generic character personalities, and make them a little more relaxed and normal. BAM! You&#039;ve just created the characters of this show. All characters are interesting, yet normal enough to even be your classmates in real life. Their flaws and strengths are fleshed out to the point that you really love and cherish the characters, yet mysterious enough for unexpectedness. All characters really compliment each other, as a group of friends should.  More importantly, they&#039;re very entertaining together.<br />
Io - The dense lady charmer.<br />
Tsumiki - The short, tsundere cat-like girl in love with Io.<br />
Hime - The cute, friendly klutz.<br />
Sakaki - Laid-back prankster.<br />
Mayoi - Technologically smart prankster.<br />
The supporting cast is quite amazing too. Heck, they&#039;re personalities are deep enough to make them main characters if they were given more screen time. All the characters work together well while at the same time each having their own unique charm; as friends should. Do I really need to say more? IT&#039;S A BIG GROUP OF FRIENDS! (9 because they&#039;re not as original as some might hope)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 10<br />
One of my favourites; period. I&#039;ll never forget it. I love it more than I can even express in words. When I&#039;m bored, I go back and pick a random episode to re-watch and enjoy all over again. I&#039;d recommend it to anyone and express my utter love for it if anyone would listen to boring-ol&#039;-me.  If you&#039;re looking to jump into the slice of life genre, or even in you&#039;re not for that matter, watch &quot;Acchi Kocchi&quot;. You don&#039;t need to be an otaku and know a ton of references to fully enjoy it. You don&#039;t even need to think to enjoy it. Just relax and let this anime take you Place to Place.

    First time writing a review for an anime, why would I pick this anime for my first review? The only reason is because... IT&#039;S TOO CUTE ;3 <br />
<br />
This anime really makes me wonder sometimes, why isn&#039;t life more happy? ;3<br />
Reality seems more stressful, but I guess this is why cute slice of life shows the happy part of our lives ;D<br />
<br />
Story (8): There&#039;s not much of a story as it&#039;s basically a cute slice of life, sort of like Lucky Star. The main characters have a little love story going on and random things happen, that can make you laugh or drown in how &#039;kawaii&#039;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review58417">
        this anime is ;3<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Sound (10): I love the animation, it is very well done and it has CUTENESS drawn all over it. Sound also amazing, love the voice actors and the sound effects ;D<br />
<br />
Character (9): We got a variety of characters with unique personalities. Main guy character is very formal, you can say he has a dry-humor. His guy friend reminds me of a Sunahara from Clannad XD The main girl Tsumiki is soooooooooooooooooooooo cute, cat ears ftw. Then we got a jokester and a girl that is exactly like Rena from Higurashi (Just that she&#039;s not a yandere).<br />
<br />
Enjoyment &amp; Overall (10): I think this anime first episode deserves more than just a 7.6 rating, probably a high 8, that&#039;s what I would give it. Very enjoyable if you like slice of life and cute things, I see it as potentially better than Lucky Star and other slice of life animes.<br />

Given the intro, graphics and such, I just figured this was another carbon copy of &#039;Kill Me Baby&#039;, and while many of the setups and gags were in the same vein, at least here there was a thread to follow, thin, but still a thread.<br />
<br />
I think people who watch this can be easily divided into two groups: those who scrunch up their eyebrows and say &#039;what?&#039; when Mayoi is on the loudspeaker asking people to look to their right, then telling them &quot;there is a wall&quot;, and then those who hear that line  and have to hit pause because they&#039;re laughing so hard.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed

        the fact that the storyline didn&#039;t try to force the relationship between Io and Tsumiki.  Heck, they&#039;re comfortable, and high school is a hassle as it is, but I never expected a kiss or hug at the end.  It was good friends helping each other through their trials and tribulations, many of which were self-administered...<br />
<br />
My ideal ending (I was disappointed in the anime finale) would have been to follow up on the end of episode 11, where Io feels a blush as he thinks of Tsumiki and might be realizing he has more than friendly feelings for her.  I thought they had it nailed after Part A for valentines, but in Part B, when Tsumiki thanked him for the cat treat he made just for her, I&#039;d have shown him holding out his hand and saying something like &quot;Any time. Let&#039;s go home&#039;, and after a frozen second for Tsumiki, she takes his hand and they walk away from the camera toward the station.  That not only takes the relationship one small step forward, it closes the loop from the first episode when Tsumiki is trying to catch up to Io and is trying to grab his coat/arm just as Mayoi shows up.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t see a second season, but I enjoyed having them as friends.

    P.S: I Know, i shouldn&#039;t review animes after only one episode. But i think i won&#039;t go as far as watching the second one. And that&#039;s why.<br />
<br />
BORING. That&#039;s the only thing that popped up in my mind while watching the first episode of this anime. Or maybe i should say &quot;while constantly watching the progress bar waiting for it to end&quot;.<br />
<br />
Story/Character: 4<br />
Obviously the story isn&#039;t original at all, the summary itself makes you think of &quot;stereotype&quot;, but i hoped in some parody of the characters, which is what they usually do with such blatant stereotypes. Nope.<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
It&#039;s the best part of the anime, but it&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review59429">
        not that good either. Just &quot;cute&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5<br />
I usually don&#039;t pay much attention to OSTs, so i can only say that OP is decent and ED is bad. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 2<br />
This is where the anime fails. It&#039;s absolutely boring. I know this isn&#039;t a comedy anime, but its structure is sketch-like, so the result is... a comedy anime that isn&#039;t funny. One of the worst types of anime.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4<br />
Maybe i should have seen where this was going from the art/summary. I wathched Lucky Star before, and someone said this was similar. For the record, i dropped Lucky Star at half series because it was a little boring. But at least there were funny moments. <br />
<br />
Well, i suggest not watching this, but since this has a high rating and i see a lot of people who like this just because &quot;it&#039;s cute&quot;, maybe it could satisfy those kind of watchers. it surely didn&#039;t satisfy me.

    If you want to see an anime where moe caricatures crash into each other, trip on banana peels and produce nosebleeds capable of filling up an olympic-sized swimming pool with blood every single episode then you have found your anime. If however you&#039;re looking for a more meaningful comedy then by all means skip this one out as you won&#039;t miss out on much. <br />
<br />
I have to admit I had high expectations for this anime after skimming through all the reviews and forum posts praising Acchi Kocchi&#039;s comedic wit and entertainment value. And while initially the show did manage to make me smile and chuckle

          <span style="display: none;" id="review130327">
        on occasion during the first 2 episodes, that quickly turned into boredom and disappointment. Why? There&#039;s an easy explanation:<br />
<br />
Acchi Kocchi has no real story to speak of. It&#039;s fully episodic nature and complete devotion to a slice-of-life theme means that it basically replays the same premise and setting every single episode. Now that in itself wouldn&#039;t be bad (basic sitcom formula) but this anime also replays the same jokes over and over again as well. Mayoi (one of the girls in the cast) trips on a banana peel, Mayoi trips on ice, Mayoi trips on a puddle of water. Now apply that to every other character and by the end of the series you&#039;ll be bored enough to actually try to lick your own elbow. <br />
<br />
The dialogue is no different. The two most common expressions you&#039;ll hear the most every single episode in roughly 15-20 second intervals are &quot;kawaii&quot; or &quot;kawaii desu&quot;. Once the initial premise is established the dialogue is recycled more furiously than plastic in Germany. It basically comes down to this - girls compliment male lead. Male lead compliments them back. They nosebleed. That&#039;s pretty much it. Something like this CAN be funny but not for the entire duration of a full 12 episode series.<br />
<br />
Secondary male characters appeared to be the only hope later on but unfortunately they shared the same fate as the rest of the cast, only adding more fuel to this burning wreck of an anime. <br />
<br />
The only truly positive aspects of Acchi Kocchi would be the quality of animation and the fairly decent OST. While the style itself was not something I enjoyed (huge Moe overdose), the anime was done decently. The only issue with art I have would be that every other living organism apart from cats and our cast is a greyed out stationary statue. Either the studio was lazy or they decided to go with it as a &quot;stylistic&quot; choice but I didn&#039;t like it. It just made the anime as a whole look a bit cheap. <br />
<br />
The enjoyment you&#039;ll get from Acchi Kocchi will only be from the first 2-3 episodes. After that the story, characters, jokes and dialogue go into loop mode and you will not miss anything if you try to drop it after that point. <br />
<br />
Overall, this anime was in fact a poor experience. The studio basically created a 3 episode OVA and stretched it out far beyond its entertainment value. <br />
<br />
4 points.

    Honestly, i am not the type who can enjoy an anime which doesnt have any strong plot or using an &quot;cute&quot; character like Azumanga Daioh or Lucky star. But for this one its exceptional.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
From the start i am watching this anime i have a mix feelings from &quot;WTF&quot; into &quot;SMM (So Much Moeness)&quot;. I dont really understand a bit about this one but along with a few episodes finally i got hooked...no, not hooked. but GOT IN LOVE with this one.<br />
<br />
Acchi Kocchi or Place to Place in english is a typical slice of life anime with comedy and some romance on it. The story is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review96901">
        about.... no, i will said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ever feel being teased by your friends because you got crush on somebody?&quot;<br />
&quot;Did you feel annoyed by being teased or maybe happy because of it?&quot;<br />
<br />
That question was enough to describe on what this anime is about. Summary, this anime was about Tsumiki who loves Io but she cant express it in front of him. So, her friends&quot; helping&quot; her with teasing her and Io so she can honest to herself. <br />
<br />
In this 12 episodes, you will see many funny moments and romantic feeling that makes you saying &quot;aaaawwww... thats cute&quot;. I am kinda surprised about this anime since my first assumption is this anime will full of pushed unfunny jokes and a bland romance. But i am wrong, this anime was full of romantic, funny, cute, amusing, entertaining, adorable, kawaiii, and *insert any good feelings on it* moments. In short, this anime was like Lucky Star or Nichijou + Romance and so we have Acchi Kocchi.<br />
<br />
The art on this anime was top notch, i say it in &quot;unique&quot; way not in &quot;epic&quot; way.  What i mean with unique is in Acchi Kocchi they always have a summary in every scenes to explain what happen in that scene (see it for yourself, since its kinda hard to describe it). Because this anime was full with funny and cute moments, the art is supporting it with colorful and bright background and of course, cute design.<br />
<br />
The main character we have in Acchi Kocchi is a circle of friends that consists of five person. Io, Tsumiki, Hime, Mayoi, and Sakaki.<br />
- Io is the main character in this anime, he is someone that is senseless if its about love. Even his friends teasing him with Tsumiki, he still doesnt realize it.<br />
- Tsumiki is your adorable main character. She have a crush on Io, but she is too shy to express it and so, she is being teased by her friends.<br />
- Mayoi is your annoying character or friends, she is partner-in-crime with Sakaki in teasing Io and Tsumiki. She loves to teasing between these two. (everyone is definitely have a friend like this, LOL)<br />
- Hime is your shy character. What is memorable for her is her bloody nose in every romantic scenes.<br />
- Sakaki is like Mayoi, your annoying friends that love to tease people. In this case, is Io and Sakaki. but without him, i am sure it will not exciting.<br />
<br />
With that mini description on each character, i am sure you will have imagine on how &quot;exciting&quot; this anime was. Yes, it was like in our life. We have always annoying friends but without him/her, it will be quiet and not exciting.<br />
<br />
Summary, this anime was an excellent choice if you want to have an enjoyable show. Its funny, heartwarming, and adorable show. Maybe some of you will doubt watching this anime because of the art. But believe me, sometimes crossing the lines or trying something new is not bad as you think (like myself).

    It&#039;s hard for me to find a slice of life comedy I can enjoy from beginning to end. Paniponi Dash!, Azumanga Daioh, Nichijou, and many others just never took the cake for me. This is most likely due to the lack of comedic and romance I value in most anime. <br />
<br />
-Story-<br />
That being said Acchi Kocchi (Place to Place) hit home when I first started watching this. There isn&#039;t really a story per say, but there is character development within certain relationships that you can follow along. Every episode is as enjoyable as the last, Including the special.<br />
<br />
-Art-<br />
The art is perfect for me. It&#039;s my kind

          <span style="display: none;" id="review89319">
        of art. Its bright, cute, and certain aspects of the anime bring things to life. They put a lot of detail into the pen spinning and many other things.<br />
<br />
-Sound-<br />
I usually don&#039;t give sound a high rating unless it&#039;s deserved. The opening and ending theme of Acchi Kocchi is beyond good. The cast was perfect for each character. Everything was brought to life in a great way. I wouldn&#039;t change a thing.<br />
<br />
-Character-<br />
Every character is unique and developed with certain qualities that make you love them all. There isn&#039;t a character i find annoying enough to hate.<br />
<br />
-Enjoyment-<br />
The romance and comedy is what takes the cake. Everything is cute, funny, and exciting. I look forward to hoping a second season comes around. Overall I give this a high re-watch rating.

    Worst anime I have seen in my life. 12 episodes was too much to endure for a show with so little meaning and purpose behind it. Those 288 minutes I wasted I would like repaid to me in brain cells I lost while suffering behind my computer screen in agony. Here is my review of Acchi Kocchi:<br />
<br />
Presentation: On the surface, Acchi Kocchi has a bright, chibi quirk about it that lured me in from pictures online. It LOOKS fun, bouncy, and promising from a distance but this show affirms the notion you should NEVER judge a book by the cover.<br />
<br />
Story: There is none. None whatsoever.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review226473">
        The premise of Acchi Kocchi is that of a tsundere, cat-child hybrid who episode after episode fails to confess her lingering feelings for the object of her affections. Each episode is basically a gag reel of how main characters Tsumiki, Mayoi, Hime, Sakaki, and Io experience daily life in and out of school. <br />
<br />
Characters: I have never met a cast so atrocious since Infinite Stratos and Love Hina. With FIVE characters at the shows disposal to develop and experiment with, they instead decided to mold each one of them to a cheap and bland Japanese stereotype. Tsumiki is the female tsundere, Io the cool charmer, Sakaki the class clown, Mayoi the instigator, and Hime the self conscious and shy girl. The stereotypes would almost be fine in MODERATION but what Acchi Kocchi does is EXAGGERATE each characters personalities (if you can even call them that) and takes them to the farthest extreme possible. The show by itself is already miserable enough, but when the lack of story and plot progression is compounded by weak and bland characters, it&#039;s insufferable.<br />
<br />
Art: Decent at best but mediocre if I&#039;m being honest. The colors are bright but the character designs look like carbon cutouts from any other anime of this awful genre. Even close ups aren&#039;t spectacular which other anime typically capitalize on the most to show off the quality of the art style. The backgrounds are forgettable and even scenes which are supposed to be beautiful don&#039;t strike any real impression. The art is just as bland and soulless as the characters.<br />
<br />
Voices: This was almost the worst part. In conjunction with their awful personalities, the characters&#039; VOICES detracted from any enjoyment I could possibly draw from Acchi Kocchi. Tsumiki, the neko-tsundere hybrid, had one of the most annoying and ridiculous voices I have ever heard, and this was in the Japanese version. Her voice, quiet and CONSTANTLY mumbling, managed to make itself EVEN WORSE by the &quot;Nya~&quot;s she screamed every other frame. Mayoi&#039;s voice was NO BETTER in that by trying to sound so cute (to masquerade the ill-intent of her character) made me resent her more than anyone else in the pitiful program. Sakaki sounded like a bad version of Sunohara from Clannad and Io&#039;s voice actor had to put forth such little effort to produce his voice it was barely noticeable and unmemorable. Hime WOULD HAVE had a normal voice if the actress weren&#039;t trying so hard to portray her as a overbearingly weak and sensitive baby girl.<br />
<br />
Comedy: This show tried so hard to be funny and that is ultimately what killed it. With every second a girls&#039; nose exploding, it was almost as if they were experiencing their period busting out of their heads. Mayoi&#039;s antics were not entertaining nor were they cute. Had she performed one of her infamous gags and died in a terrible accident, THAT would have been more comedic than ANYTHING else this buttstain of a &quot;comedy&quot; tried to do. Sakaki was no better. His only point of interest was the neglect and abuse he received from characters around him who, to be quite honest, deserved to be subjected to the same cruel and unusual punishment as him. This show was not funny and the harder it tried to be, the more painful it became to sit through.<br />
<br />
Overall: This show is a piece of shit. It&#039;s garbage. Maybe my problem is I came in looking for plot, story, character development, complex interpersonal relationships, and perplexing things of the like. I came for something that would challenge me, but even judging by the surface I shouldn&#039;t have expected that. This was a huge waste of my gotdamn time and I almost regret it. I&#039;d pray for this memory to be erased from my mind but I don&#039;t even want the possibility of me trying to watch this show again in another life. <br />
<br />
Do not watch this anime if you value yourself at all. ANY anime is better than this rubbish.

    On the surface, Acchi Kocchi looks like your typical high school slice of life rom-com filled with overused cliches such as school festivals, beach excursions, valentines day drama, and the like. While that is an accurate description of the general concept of this show, it excelled at making me laugh through unconventional and random humor, and making me smile at the sweet and tender moments the show sets up. With a cast of adorable (albeit cliche; we have the clueless male lead, the tsundere female lead, the airheaded and innocent girl, and the over-the-top troublemakers) characters, comedy that is more than often met with a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review137979">
        laugh or chuckle, and some innocent and sweet romance, Acchi Kocchi sticks to the conventions of the genre and brings us something relaxing and entertaining to watch.<br />
<br />
Based off a 4-panel manga, Acchi Kocchi follows the slightly unusual lives of Otonashi Io, a quiet and reserved guy who is for the most part clueless about many things, Tsumiki Miniwa, a shy and short girl who has trouble expressing her true feelings about a certain someone, Haruno Hime, a bubbly and innocent little airheaded girl who gets excited over the budding romance between her friends, Katase Mayoi, a electronics wizard who has a knack for coming up with schemes that often leave her friends annoyed and unamused, and Inui Sakaki, Mayoi&#039;s male counterpart in crime, and rounds out our group as the hot-headed center of harassment and jokes. We follow this group of friends as they do homework, attend festivals, go to the beach, make chocolate for valentine&#039;s day, and a myriad of other activities typical high school students do.<br />
<br />
The comedy is best described by the title, in that it really is all over the place. For anyone who has watched their fair share of high school slice of life comedies, Acchi Kocchi does come up with some hilarious original content, and most of the punchlines hit the mark while a rarer few disappoint. From watching the rest of the group fawn over Tsumiki&#039;s affections towards a nonchalant Io to seeing Sakaki receive the brunt of a bad situation, I found it hard to wipe the grin off my face while watching the show. The romance, on the other hand, is slow and mellow. The show takes the time to set up really nice moments between Io and Tsumiki, and are more often than not adorable and sweet. For any fans of romance, the romance presented in this show is easy on the eyes and heart.<br />
<br />
Moe is a controversial issue within the anime community; some absolutely love it while others will hate it with every fiber of their being. While Acchi Kocchi does contain a good deal of moe, it didn&#039;t diminish the quality of the comedy or the romance in any way. In fact, in most occasions, it made a bit all the more funny or a tender moment all the more sweet. Even if you&#039;re not a fan of it, Acchi Kocchi has something for everyone.<br />
<br />
The art is cute and lively, and the characters are reminiscent of Nichijou&#039;s. It is somewhat childish, but is expected for a show of this genre. The animation is fluid and easy on the eyes, and parts like Mayoi doing some crazy stunt are well animated. The sound is bright and lighthearted, and will have you humming the OP even after the show is over. <br />
<br />
Acchi Kocchi is one of those &quot;don&#039;t judge a book by it&#039;s cover&quot; series. While it may seem like a cliche moe-blob with little to no substance, it may just catch you a little off guard, and hopefully make you laugh and smile.<br />

    Based on all the glowing reviews, I expected this to be a cute, funny and unique series.<br />
<br />
Well, it certainly is cute, but it&#039;s lacking a lot in other areas.<br />
I&#039;ll try to leave this review as short and straightforward as I can. <br />
<br />
This anime is, essentially, your standard slice of life anime. Most of it&#039;s characters are cliche character archetypes. Now, sometimes this cast of characters can make for an interesting show, but not in this case. The main character herself is very cute, and it&#039;s rather disappointing that this series was brought down by it&#039;s cliche cast. (Though I was constantly questioning what was going

          <span style="display: none;" id="review80238">
        on with her hair. The ahoge was cute, but what exactly are those little things on her bangs supposed to be?)<br />
<br />
The comedy throughout the series was very... Different. There may be some people who find the jokes amusing, but to most I&#039;ve actually spoken to about the series (and myself), the humor gets lost. This may be due to the language barrier, I&#039;m not sure. Maybe in Japanese the jokes actually make sense and are funny. But when translated, they just aren&#039;t that funny.<br />
<br />
I had high hope for this anime, with all the glowing reviews, and the absolutely adorable artwork. But what I ended up with, instead, was your run of the mill slice of life anime that tries to be funny, but who&#039;s jokes just end up very dry and boring. <br />
<br />
In my honest opinion, it was hard to sit through even the first episode. I&#039;m not particularly sure how I made it through the whole series.

    Every season we look for those animes that make us look forward to the day they will be aired and this is definitely one of those animes for this season!<br />
<br />
(8)Story:<br />
Doesn&#039;t look like there&#039;s any real story to this show other than it&#039;s a kinda slice of life anime with a lot of cute and [very] funny moments. It&#039;s only the first episode but I don&#039;t think it will disappoint.<br />
<br />
(9)Art:<br />
I like the art very much in this show, the character shows in the art. It&#039;s very clean and there were no problems with the animation and the little cat ears on Tsumiki were very adorable and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review58103">
        made me giggle every time I saw them (yes I said giggle and no I&#039;m not a little girl!).<br />
<br />
(7)Sound:<br />
I usually don&#039;t listen to the OP or the ED of a show but this one had a very very catch and amusing OP with a very calm and soothing ending which were both very enjoyable to listen to.<br />
<br />
(10)Character:<br />
Characters are what&#039;s going to make this show and they certainly make it good. Each character has an amazing personalty that works with the group and made each moment of this first episode very easy and exciting to watch. I especially enjoy Tsumiki&#039;s shy/tsundere but at moments very daring.<br />
<br />
(10)Enjoyment:<br />
It is only the first episode but I must say, it has a very very enjoyable show. It had its laughable moments, it&#039;s cute moments and it&#039;s devious moments and I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll continue through the whole season.<br />
<br />
(10)Overall:<br />
Overall I just had to give this show a 10 and I think just watching one episode of this you could agree it&#039;s going to be one of those animes where you do look forward to it every week and sad when it&#039;s gone.

    When I was young, I have always enjoyed those Looney Tunes cartoons and the Disney shorts. Acchi Kocchi is one of those anime where I can go to my dentist&#039;s office and watch that without having any fear. Acchi Kocchi was able to show the true colors of moe and comedy combined.<br />
<br />
You may think Acchi Kocchi is another rom-com anime with an indecisive main character with no attraction, but you are absolutely wrong. While watching Acchi Kocchi, it gave me a heartwarming feeling. Acchi Kocchi focuses on a maiden in love, Tsumiki Miniwa, trying to find her way into Io Otonashi&#039;s heart. You can say

          <span style="display: none;" id="review101225">
        that there are those lovey-dovey events, yet there are hilarious examples Tsumiki tries to approach Io. You can say the most famous romance line, &quot;Anata.. wa .. wa-ta-shi ~ *wink*.&quot; was used and it even made me baffle in love. Even though it was overused, Acchi Kocchi was able to show the true meaning of &quot;Do you want me&quot; as a good romance line. The best part was that the scene has a comedic approach that it made me cry of laughter. A good example is: Do you know that character who cock blocks? Yeah, that character&#039;s in there. I don&#039;t hate that character in Acchi Kocchi, but I would definitely hate it in real life. It is hilarious to see what Tsumiki has to face in order to achieve Io&#039;s heart. Lastly, the episodes are kept organized and neat which makes me love it. I would definitely want to see another anime like this.<br />
<br />
The art style is unique. The anime has a moe-style which you can say that the characters look very cute and chibi. The colors are simple and the animations are great. I love simple art colors and it reminds me much of OreShura&#039;s art coloring. Animes similar to Acchi Kocchi would definitely be Lucky☆Star and Nichijou. If you have seen either one of them, you should definitely pick up this anime.<br />
<br />
The sound is great. This anime focuses on moe so most of the sounds are cute. The opening is well made and the audio is cute. The ending is what got me the most. It was sung by Tsumiki (I honestly think the voice actress did a great job) and the voice actress is Ookubo, Rumi. She was the voice actress of Yoshikawa, Chinatsu in Yuri Yuri. Listening to the ending was cute and soothing. It isn&#039;t like those fast paced audio, but a good slow paced with a good beat/tone.<br />
<br />
Well, time to wrap up this review. It is sad that we have to depart, but I will be writing more reviews time by time. The enjoyment is very good. I was able to glue my butt onto my chair and not multi task while watching this anime. Most of people would probably text or browse forums or etc, but I had that on hold till I finished this anime. I even had pause watching the on-going anime to finish Acchi Kocchi. If you enjoy moe, romance and comedy, Acchi Kocchi is definitely for you. <br />
<br />
For those who haven&#039;t seen this anime, but read my review, I have a preview for you to get you interested! Fear not, there are no spoilers and will never be in my review.<br />

    Normally, I am not the type of person that can sit through a slice of life anime like this with no real story (like lucky star). However this one caught my attention one day and I was gladly surprised to find that it was not that bad of a show.<br />
<br />
Story: 6/10<br />
The plot is very simple, its just about High-schoolers that are in love. If you are going into this anime expecting to find an amazing and deep plot, then you are going to be dissapointed. Story is the weakest part of this anime,  in fact it  does not have much of a story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review120503">
        to speak of. This is not necessarily a deal breaker because what it lacks story wise, it makes up for in other sections. Most of the &quot;plot&quot; consist of the main group of friends in different situations. If you just want an anime to watch that is not really demanding and is just fun, then it should not be that much of a problem.<br />
<br />
Art:8/10<br />
Acchi Kocchi&#039;s art is very simple and colorful. It resembles the art of Lucky Star a lot and it at 1st, may turn you off of  because it looks childish. Originally I didn&#039;t watch this anime because of the art, I saw 1 picture and immediately tossed it aside. However, when I actually sat down and watched it I sort of became accustomed to it. The one thing about the art that must be said is that it really complements the anime. It fits the laid back themes of romance and comedy rather well. Also, Miniwa is adorable.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
The sound track of the show, while not necessarily bad, didn&#039;t stand out to much. Aside form the really addictive and upbeat opening theme, there is no one, stand out track. The music fits when it is played and does its job well.<br />
<br />
Characters: 9/10<br />
This is were this anime (like many slice of life anime) shines. It really relies on the interactions between the characters to drive the show. The relationship between the the main 2 characters is not really new, however it is done really well. The main heroin Miniwa, is a well done character, that is in love with the main lead, but is to afraid to tell him about her feelings. Unlike most tsunderes that are normally cold towards their lovers, Miniwa just gets really shy, this is the main reason she is adorable (that and the cat ears). The main protagonist of the show Io is the extremely dense, and that cannot see that Miniwa has obvious feelings for him. In each episode they get closer to each other and it was fun to see them gradually come together.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
This anime really has made me expand my anime roster and not turn down anime at 1st glance. I fell in love with the main characters and after every episode wanted to immediately watch the next one to see them get closer.<br />
I came out of this show with a smile on my face. The music and art really fit the romance and cuteness of the show and I am glad that I got around to watching this anime. It is definitely worth you&#039;re time if you like this kind of show, and I would encourage everyone to just give it a shot if you just want to sit and relax and watch a fun, simple show. While is does not set any records for originality, it does what is set out to do really well.<br />
<br />
This is my 1st review, Hope that it&#039;s not THAT horrible :3<br />
<br />

    Acchi Kocchi: This Anime&#039;s Story Was All Over The Place!<br />
<br />
Okay, I know. REALLY bad pun. I just had to get it out before getting into this review.<br />
<br />
Acchi Kocchi is one of those series that I found to be just magical in its presentation. There is no &quot;Madoka Magica&quot; surprises with the cute animation though. What you see is what you get, a bunch of cutely animated HS characters doing hilariously cute things. The &quot;story&quot; revolves around a group of five high school friends participating in hilarious everyday activities, from making odd Valentine&#039;s Day chocolates for each other, to scaring each other with a bear suit

          <span style="display: none;" id="review88665">
        and a creepily made paper bag mask. Acchi Kocchi really is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you&#039;re going to get when it comes to the random acts of comedy thrown your way.<br />
<br />
I found the characters to be the strongest aspect of this series, with the lead character essentially being a small, quiet catlike tsundere named Tsumiki. She has a strong attraction for the stoic, yet unobservant Io, a boy who&#039;s quietly romantic demeanor makes him a heartthrob for all the girls in their group. The other three members of made up of Hime, a clumsy, whimsical girl who&#039;s shyness shines when it comes to attractions of the opposite sex, Sakaki, the other boy in the group who&#039;s fantasies are less than desired by the rest of the group (and usually ends up in some sort of painful experience), and finally Yayoi, an ambitiously creative lab coat-wearing girl whose ideas usually cause trouble for the rest of the group. When I was first introduced to the members of this group, I was hesitant how this series would work, but I was amazed at the chemistry the characters shared with each other. What I absolutely loved about it was how the characters knew each other so well, they&#039;d say and do things to try and help each other out, primarily speaking, the obvious feelings that Io and Tsumiki have for each other but neither has the courage to say. Watching Io and Tsumiki work off each other was downright adorable and the three other characters interactions added the comedy element that this anime had no shortage of.<br />
<br />
I found another strength of this series was just sound in general. The voice acting, the music, and even the solo performance instrumentals and sound effects running in the background made this series shine. It was able to match the tone the animation and story was setting to a T. When something quirky was happening, you could hear a solo xylophone player playing a mischievous tune. When something endearing was happening, you could hear a solo acoustic guitar player playing a heartfelt tune. It was the small nuances during the show that made the series feel heartwarming. <br />
<br />
While the animation was simplistic and far from what we&#039;d call &quot;great&quot;, where it made up in that department was creativity. I absolutely loved the arrow themed title cards that would pop up between scenes that would hilariously map out the previous scene, or the small additions of random props that matched the joyful theme of the series, like cat ears on the curiously quiet Tsumiki.<br />
<br />
Where the anime fell short was really in the story and the character development. The story is extremely non-progressive with the characters&#039; development (or lack there of). There isn&#039;t exactly a &quot;story&quot; that these characters are really involved in. The &quot;story&quot; of this series is just the random things these five high schoolers are doing. The character development was severely lacking because all we learn about the characters is their personalities. We don&#039;t see any of their back stories, such as how these characters met or what caused them to have their extremely unique personalities. There&#039;s no &quot;progression&quot; in the story. In fact, you could watch this series COMPLETELY out of order and you would not miss any important plot points. The ONLY plot point that might be noticed if watched out of order were the two Valentine&#039;s Day episodes. Considering the sort of relationship Io and Tsumiki had with each other, it&#039;s one of those series where you&#039;re rooting for something to happen, although if you&#039;re wishing, you&#039;ll be left somewhat disappointed. Although, I will admit the buildup between Io and Tsumiki over the last two episodes appeared to be building a strong foundation for a romantic climax. I just thought it fell a little flat. <br />
<br />
The best way I can describe Acchi Kocchi is it&#039;s a great series to watch if you&#039;re just looking for a simple comedy series where you can just shut the brain off and just enjoy some hilarious sketch bits. It&#039;s an endearing show that leaves you with no angst or qualms about the characters or story. It&#039;s just a simple series that&#039;s good for a pick-me-up if you&#039;re feeling down. I know I was feeling a little depressed going into this series and it managed to bring a smile to my face as I watched. It&#039;s extremely similar to Lucky Star in it&#039;s simplistically animated comedy styling while the scriptwriting is comparable to a quirky series like Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou. Like I said earlier, if you go into this expecting a Madoka Magica-like twist, you&#039;re watching the wrong series. If you go into this judging solely by the &quot;book by the cover&quot; analogy, you&#039;re getting exactly what you bargained for.

    Acchi Kocchi is a show ahead of its time. Outstanding in all fields, a true masterpiece. While watching, I only felt amazement and shame - my eyes are not worthy to view something so perfect, almost as if it was made for the Gods themselves.<br />
<br />
What makes Acchi Kocchi so great, is that, on top of the gorgeous art, unique and relaxing character designs, and orgasmic soundtrack, it has the best writing one could ever possibly imagine. Fumitoshi Oizaki makes Gen Urobuchi look like a stagnant pedant who is capable of only writing children&#039;s literature. The characters are so well written I know I could die

          <span style="display: none;" id="review63491">
        for Tsumiki if I knew her in real life. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat with excitement, pulling you through countless ups and downs, while also managing to be something completely innovative, original, fresh. A new idea. <br />
<br />
Anyways I like this show and it&#039;s really a masterpiece, if you didn&#039;t like it your opinion is probably not as good as mine<br />
<br />
10/10 best slice of all time

    Your first two questions when considering this anime might be “Is it actually cute?” and “Does it have much substance?” <br />
<br />
For the answer to the former question, I invite you to take a look at the picture of Tsumiki Miniwa on her character page. Look at that face! Can you…deny…that face? And look at the top of her head; even though she’s a normal human, the show puts cat ears on her all the time without any explanation, just to boost her moe points. Truly terrifying. Not to mention she’s shy but tries to show her feelings. Moe. Soft-spoken and thoughtful. Moe. Super short but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147449">
        has a huge weird hair curl thing. Moe. And, of course, she’s got a little girl crush on our male main character, Io Otonashi. Moe. Moe. Moe. Moe. Moe.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Io, if it’s even remotely tenable to describe a male character as moe, then I would have to assert that Io is moe to the max. He’s tall, smart, soft-spoken like Tsumiki, and is very self-reliant in a way that reminded me of Ryuuji from Toradora. Plus, despite seeming rather oblivious to Tsumiki’s adoration, he doesn’t actually get fazed much by girls at all. He’s not afraid of physical contact, and when he wants to, he can perform embarrassing romantic lines with enough smoothness to give girls nosebleeds (e.g. the light from these fireworks pales in comparison to the light I see when I gaze into your eyes). This becomes a reoccurring joke too, which somehow never gets too old. <br />
<br />
Now, usually, it turns me off when I see nosebleeds used as a joke in comedies, such as in Yuru Yuri. Aside from the obvious fact that people don’t generally get nosebleeds from sexual arousal, it just never appealed to me aesthetically. However, in this case, it was okay, and I’m not sure why. Maybe it was because the way it was animated here looks so childish that my unconscious aversion to the blood was not even triggered. <br />
<br />
Another pet peeve of mine is when a male character is so dense that it becomes an impenetrable wall against character and plot development. Even though Io sort of fits this bill at times, yet again, the show manages to win me over. In this case, their friends, particularly Mayoi, alleviates all possible frustration by being acutely aware of what’s happening and pushing the pair at each with well-intentioned (or maybe not so well-intentioned) teasing (or just physically pushing them at each other :P). <br />
<br />
Really, this show is so self-aware and the timing of its jokes so precise that everything feels like a giant pillow fight. The voices and sounds in the opening theme are ridiculously adorable. The ending theme, while slower, follows the same fundamental principles of cuteness. The slapstick humor in this show, which has annoyed me in numerous other shows in the past, seems cute here for some reason. Then, Mayoi and Sakaki’s mischievous moe presents a nice contrast to Tsumiki and Io’s quiet moe. And Hime…I don’t even know…she’s like a personification of this show’s punchline, materialized. (even the title of this show is cute! Acchi Kocchi?) <br />
<br />
So, my answer to, “Is it cute?” would have to be, “I almost got diabetes.” <br />
<br />
Does it have substance though? That’s a much tougher question to answer. This is first and foremost a comedy rather than, say, a romance or drama, so most of its runtime is dedicated to the giant pillow fight. If I start with the assumption that the pillow fight does not create substance, then I suppose there wasn’t that much substance? Yet, when the show did become a little more serious, I was pleasantly surprised by how sweetly it was handled, such that I was a little disappointed that I didn’t get more of it. Nevertheless, by the end of the season, there was enough good feeling here to wake up the slice of life lover in me and warm my heart. <br />
<br />
And just for that, this review comes with a solid recommendation.<br />

    “Kawaii” - Adjective, meaning “cute” or “adorable”, and is a big element in Anime. So much so that it even has its own genre. Synonymous to “moe”, “kawaii” has, over the years, been a definite attracting part of Anime. And nothing describes Acchi Kocchi more, then “kawaii”…. Except maybe “sugoku kawaii”… or “hounto sugoku kawaii”.<br />
<br />
The plot isn’t brain straining at all. It simply revolves on the lives of a group of high-schoolers, and their wacky and mind-numbingly cute excursions. And with that, you can expect a lot of giggles, chuckles, snorts, and even the occasional, loud burst of laughter. And since we’re talking about high-schoolers

          <span style="display: none;" id="review72927">
        here, there will definitely be romance. Or in this case, a strange affection between a cat and a boy who can make any woman his with his “BISHOUNEN” power! (By that, I mean his looks. If you’re not familiar with it, then try looking up Katsuragi, Keima from TWGOK, or Usui Takumi from Maid-Sama)<br />
<br />
With that said, there definitely won’t be an actual story-line. In fact, each anime episode is divided into two parts (Part A and Part B). Each could either be related to the previous, or a totally different story altogether. It’s kinda like watching different volumes of a gag-manga… except it’s anime. This makes Acchi Kocchi a good choice to those who just want to watch something light and uncomplicated, and to those who just want to pass the time with some anime.<br />
<br />
Next is the art.<br />
As you may already know, the art is very cute. Living up to its manga counterpart, it is mainly composed of SD (super-deformed) characters appearing very often in the anime, courtesy of AIC. The OPs and EDs were also very nice, and deliciously executed. (“Deliciously” in the sense that some parts of the OPs and EDs actually look edible.) And with the transitions coupling together nicely with the overall art of the anime, makes Acchi Kocchi a neat watch. <br />
<br />
 Now, the sound.<br />
Personally, the theme song is kind of like one of those songs that sound outright weird, but still catchy. The theme song and the end song are both fitting for the anime, but they’re not really songs you’d like to be stuck on repeat in your phone. <br />
<br />
The Seiyuus were also pretty nice. All the voices fitted pretty nicely, although my favorite one would definitely be Mayoi. She’s like that one friend who’s always doing something that could be considered extremely weird and stupid to other people, but normal exclusively to her. Spouting out random irrelevant gags along the way, she is definitely an important piece in the anime.<br />
<br />
And finally, the verdict.<br />
As a whole, Acchi Kocchi was definitely an interesting watch. It managed to keep me interested for the whole of 12 episodes and left me with a somewhat satisfied feeling when it ended. It kept me occupied for about three days, and often leaving me with unfinished homework…. Well, I guess the unfinished homework was more of my fault then the anime’s… (I am not a good role model. :3) Anyway, all in all, it’s a great watch. I’d give it an 8.5 or an 8.7, considering it’s light-heartedness, although that’s probably as high as I can give to an anime without an actual storyline. <br />
<br />
I recommend this anime to those who don’t really like the seriousness of life, and just like to go out and bleed their noses with cuteness and hilarity until the sun explodes.<br />
