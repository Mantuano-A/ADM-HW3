    &quot;Goddess’ Dormitory&quot; A Place For Raunchy Fun<br />
<br />
Some animes are made only and just only for the targeted audience. Megami-ryou no Ryoubo-kun aka. Mother of the Goddess&#039; Dormitory is one of those anime. and i am one of those targeted audience. Now you might see a lot of negative reviews about this anime but my perspective is a little dissimilar in the case of *Ecchi and Harem* genre.<br />
<br />
[Prologue] <br />
<br />
Considering that the very first shot of Mother of the Goddess’ Dormitory features three of its characters stark-raving nude in the bath, some would argue if that sight alone would either raise or lower a viewer&#039;s interest. After

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416725">
        all, many harem anime use fan-service to keep its viewers attention, especially those that have bland storytelling. However, merely tuning out just because of its first scene does the series a disservice. In fact, as Mother of the Goddess&#039; Dormitory progresses, one will find something surprising about its narrative.<br />
<br />
[Story]<br />
<br />
Based on the manga by Ikumi Hino, Mother of the Goddess’ Dormitory follows a down-on-his-luck boy named Koushi Nagumo (Misuzu Yamada). And I’ll admit, starting the episode with nudity and nipples is one way to catch my attention. The show formally introduces us to Koushi, a young man that’s in a really bad place as he’s homeless and without money, hungry and desperate. That’s when he’s offered a job from a really hilarious pervy point of view to become a dorm mother. Mineru’s brought him back to where a group of college-aged women live that are goddess-level beauties, but she hasn’t told him that, or what the job is specifically. He’s just happy to be fed and have a place to crash. When she suggests he gets himself cleaned up in the bath, it’s a simple thing except that the bath in the dorm is filled with a trio of gorgeous girls (i.e. goddesses) that are naked. And we mean naked naked, which is what the appeal of the show will be for many. For Koushi, it’s a natural panic moment, one that has him running away naked himself, only to faceplant right into Atena’s crotch in the hall nearby. It’s so predictable (and you don&#039;t have to use your brain) that you have to laugh because the show is adhering to the classics in a way that a lot of them try to subvert these days.<br />
<br />
[Characters]<br />
<br />
Mother of the Goddess’ Dormitory doesn’t shy away from its harem label in the least bit. As mentioned, the series starts out with three of its cast members in the buff, with Koushi rightfully freaking out over the sight. This element is something that occurs a lot in the first couple of episodes, and while it’s a staple of this genre of humor, it can get a little tiresome and lazy. After all, throwing in nudity to compensate for a lack of character development is one of the worst offenses a harem series can do.<br />
<br />
Out of nowhere, the anime somehow realizes this, and begins toning down the pervertedness while focusing on the attitudes and personalities of these characters. Koushi quickly becomes someone who takes responsibility by the arm, and guides his tasks towards completion. You can see he wants to be a better man than his own father, who abandoned him for reasons yet to be revealed. In his mind, being a man means owning up to their flaws, protecting those he cares most about, and achieving his goals despite the hurdles placed in his path.<br />
<br />
The same can be said about some of the women whom Koushi lives with. Atena overcomes her fears of men, going so far as to see Koshi as a little brother she can dote on. Kiriya attempts to overcome her strong androgynous nature, showcasing that despite her tough exterior, she wants to experience love like in her favorite shojo manga. Frey, who is confident in cosplay, seeks that same strength when she wants to be herself. As for mad scientist Mineru, well, let’s just call her a lost cause for the time being.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the most mysterious of the residents is Serene, who has a strange connection with the moon. She claims the lunar orb as a source of her powers, which she demonstrates when certain situations get out of hand. While there are hints of her not being of this world, it’s yet to fully confirm these suspicions.<br />
<br />
Despite this growth in the characters, Mother of the Goddess’ Dormitory keeps most of its focus on the humorous side. Although there are many repeated gags revolved around Koshi falling in to the chests of his roommates, it tries to not just be that. A good example of this is during the college festival event, where Koushi experiences every wacky shenanigan that can occur at such an event. From Mineru selling unauthorized goods to Atena roughing it through a maid cafe job, these moments are delivered with plenty of laughable situations. (It’s also cute when Koushi accidentally drinks one of Mineru’s elixirs, only to find out it was a placebo all along!)<br />
<br />
Story-wise, Mother of the Goddess’ Dormitory is a pretty standard harem affair. Thankfully, it has a good script that keeps the narrative from going stale. It presents these characters in a way that make them easy to care about, despite its rough beginnings. This care is also demonstrated well by the voice cast, who give it their all to breathe life into these surprisingly complicated characters.<br />
<br />
[Animation]<br />
<br />
Seeing as the company was founded by ex-Xebec members, Asread (Future Diary) is a fine fit for animating Mother of the Goddess’ Dormitory. It has a very smooth and soothing animation, not too gorgeous or not shabby. it does a good job when it comes time for the fast-paced action and comedy to take hold of the viewers. And yes, they do a good job with the fan-service parts, framing them either erotically or humorously depending on the situation. Uncensored version contains a lot of nipples. Those scenes are animated perfectly. I almost forgot to mention *there was a scene where you can see the live action version of the all the female characters.* I wasn&#039;t expecting that to happen. But if you are interested i will just add that scene&#039;s screenshot in my profile.  <br />
<br />
[Sound]<br />
<br />
Composer Tomoki Kikuya (Blend S) does an okay job with the soundtrack to the anime, although it’s not as memorable as some of his past works. The melodies frame the scenes, but not in a way that punches them up. The female characters — in the guise of Megami Ryosei — helm both the show’s opening and ending theme, with mixed results. “Naughty Love” has an 80s pop vibe to it that makes it catchy, whereas “Zettai! Kimi Sengen” lacks a certain oomph in its theatrical presentation. All of the voice actors did a perfect job. Especially Atena&#039;s VA.<br />
<br />
<br />
[TL;DR]<br />
[Final Thoughts]<br />
<br />
Despite the extremely short season I personally enjoyed Goddess&#039; Dormitory But keep that in not everyone will enjoy Mother of the Goddess’ Dormitory, (not that I&#039;m complaining),  especially those who aren’t into R-rated harem series. With that being said, those who are into that genre will get a proper eyeful of fan-service with a good side of mindful character development. Yes, it can be mindless at time, but our brains deserve a little junk food here and there. So if you need something that requires little thinking and will make you laugh, then you can’t go wrong with the dish that Mother of the Goddess’ Dormitory has prepared for you.<br />

    *This is a reupload of a review I wrote before, but it was taken down cause apparently it was too early. I added a couple updates.<br />
<br />
Well, here we have this season&#039;s how-the-hell-is-this-not-labeled-as-hentai.<br />
<br />
Megami-ryou no Ryoubo-kun (Mother of the Goddess&#039; Dormitory) is another one of those anime where I have absolutely no idea whether I should rate it a 1 or 10. From the very first frame, this anime blatantly shreds any form of correctness, decency or morality. An innocent middle school kid, devastated by the sudden loss of a family and a place to call home, is thrown into a hellhole of raunchy, horny barbarians.<br />
<br />
I have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411317">
        not read the source of this anime, but I can only assume the author did not put any more than 10 seconds of thought into the plot of the story. However I&#039;ll give it the benefit of the doubt as we&#039;re only 1 episode in (Update: This point still stands). The art and sound are fine but not remarkable. The art clearly resembles every other blatant hentai and does well at it. The voice actors actually do a pretty good job at representing the character and context they&#039;re in, and by that I mean they resemble horny barbarians very well.<br />
<br />
The characters are a reincarnation of every stereotypical character in harem/romcom, but as I mentioned earlier I&#039;ll give it the benefit of the doubt because one episode isn&#039;t enough to show any development (which I doubt will happen but whatever) (Update: There have been some minor developments in the relationships between Koushi and the others as well as Atena&#039;s situation with men. It is however rather bland and tropey and my hopes aren&#039;t too high. This still pretty much applies).<br />
<br />
If there&#039;s something that this anime does well, it&#039;s staying true to what it is. It doesn&#039;t try to hide it&#039;s blatant deplorability and goes all out in the shitshow that it is. For that reason I actually gained some respect towards the show. Therefore, my opinion is that this anime is fantastic because of it&#039;s ability to not give a single shit and present itself as a disgusting, despicable sexualization of a middle-school kid with no remorse.<br />
<br />
Thus:<br />
<br />
Story - 5 (Mediocre)<br />
Art - 7 (Good)<br />
Sound - 7 (Good)<br />
Character - 6 (Fair)<br />
Enjoyment - 10 (Outstanding)<br />
Overall - 10 (Masterpiece)<br />
<br />
I will keep updating this review if anything changes, but I strongly doubt anything will.<br />
<br />
Also, yes, this is my first review on MAL. What about it?

    Wataten and Uzumaid walked so this anime could run.<br />
<br />
Mother of the Goddess’ Dormitory is softcore child porn similar to Boku no Pico. Except instead of a man molesting a child, multiple women molest a child. In terms of pedo-bait anime, this is probably the most shameless one so far—plenty of nudity, sexual innuendos galore, and maybe even sex.<br />
<br />
After his father abandoned him, a suspicious woman offers a 12-year-old boy named Koushi food and a place to stay. Upon following her to his new home, he enters the bath, and three residents of the all-female college dormitory greet him in the nude: jiggly jugs, nipples, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416704">
        all in uncensored grandeur. Soon after, Koushi becomes their “dorm mother”, tasked with laundry, cooking, and cleaning. As he interacts with the women daily, they overtly flirt with him and vie for his attention, even though he is a minor and they are adults.<br />
<br />
There are five predators, I mean lovely women, who live in the dorm. Each lady has a distinct personality that will be recognizable to fans of the harem genre. The woman who found Koushi, Minera, is a mad scientist. She works in her underwear with no bra because that’s very practical attire for working with toxic chemicals. The goth girl, Fley, forcibly dresses Koushi in sexual cosplay outfits at any chance she gets. This embarrassment quickly turns to sexual assault because she misunderstands his politeness as flirting. The silver-haired girl follows the quiet and submissive archetype (Similar to Koneko and Kanade Tachibana). She also sexually assaults Koushi. Kiriya, the red-haired girl, was raised with brothers and often gets nervous when Koushi treats her like a woman rather than a tomboy. As time passes, the writers give her more screentime—their relationship becomes increasingly more sexual. <br />
<br />
The most prominent female character is Atena, often framed as a fragile shrinking violet rather than a predator. She is afraid of men because, for some reason, she was never around boys until going to college. If she comes close to men or 12-year-old boys, she gets uncontrollable nosebleeds. After Koushi accidentally gropes her a dozen or so times, she becomes more tolerant of boys. The primary joke is that she is uncomfortable around him, but they keep sexually assaulting one another coincidentally. Koushi expresses no romantic interest in Atena, but she develops feelings for him. Those feelings manifest as an incest fetish when she learns she enjoys him calling her “older sister”.<br />
<br />
Lastly, there is a sixth girl, Sueta, who is about Koushi’s age. She frequently visits (and abuses) him at the dorm. I can summarize her personality as ‘violent tsundere’. She hits him whenever he gets flustered as a natural response to a precarious sexual situation. As much as I hate the molester girls, I resent Sueta’s inclusion in the show because they use her for pedophilic fan service. I’m not interested in “it’s just a cartoon” debates. You are welcome to your opinion. Mine is that it’s creepy to sexualize kid characters.<br />
<br />
The only thing that could be qualified as character development is how the girls progressively sexually harass Koushi in more creative ways. All I see are tiresome archetypes and stupid contrivances for fanservice moments. Occasionally there is drama, but it is immediately interrupted by groping, panties, cleavage, or nipples, so you can never really take it seriously. In my opinion, this anime is deplorable bottom-of-the-barrel scrapings. “Haha look at these hot girls sexually harassing a child” isn’t a funny joke. It’s just someone’s fetish. Why not make hentai rather than a full-length TV show? No one is getting fooled.<br />
<br />
There are a few bizarre situations where it departs from generic harem cliches and takes a sharp turn into fever dream territory. A few highlights include: A chemically induced lesbian orgy, a 12-year-old girl gets diddled by a fish, girl falls on Koushi’s dick through the ceiling. Yes, it has the same premise as the softcore hentai classic “What She Fell on Was the Tip of My Dick, Joshi Ochi!” There’s also a homage to the famous hentai “My Brother’s Slipped Inside Me in The Bathtub” in one early episode. Seeing how absurd Goddess’ Dormitory would become is the main reason I kept watching it.<br />
<br />
Based on the ecchi x harem genre, it succeeds in the breast department. The titties are bountiful and uncensored. It would get an 8/10 if you removed everything except for the 20 seconds of titties in each episode.<br />
<br />
Art-wise, it is clear that time, talent, and budget went into this production. Thanks to the lack of animation, the character art generally looks consistent. I noticed they forgot to add sound effects, like footsteps, which seems like an amateur oversight at random points. At least the opening and ending are catchy tunes. All of the voice acting is phoned in, to put it nicely. The performances made me miss the days of over-the-top acting in High School DxD. After a streak of dumpster fires, Asread probably adapted this to get a quick check from their investors. Hopefully, it is just one minor disaster that everyone involved forgets. All I want is for Asread to go back to making hilariously bad anime like Big Order and Arifureta.<br />
<br />
I would recommend you avoid Goddess’ Dormitory like the scourge it is.

    In case it wasn’t clear from the promotional material, Megami-ryou is a transparent appeal to lovers of ecchi harem fanservice. There is no attempt at constructing a continual narrative nor to create riveting characters who act in genuine ways. This is literally designed for the viewer to watch with their pants off as six girls all desire to hump one boy. If that sounds like something you’d be into, this show is golden. If not, you shouldn’t be watching.<br />
<br />
For those that fall into the intended audience - you’ll be pleased to know that this is not the type of ecchi that will manifest censorship beams

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416693">
        across the bare bosoms and bottoms of the harem, only to later remove them in a BD release. The nudity was totally uncensored upon airing on ATX channels, as far as Japan’s decency laws will allow for, and delivers the goods within the first few minutes of episode one. You will see accidental groping of tits, accidental slipping into the missionary position in the bathroom, intentional stripping in front of the MC in order to attract his attention, and an endless amount of other scenarios that high level degens should be familiar with. <br />
<br />
Megami-ryou also succeeds in having an aesthetically attractive and diverse best girl cast. You have the adorably naive, caring Athena who acts like an onee chan to the main character. She has nice tits. The shy goth cosplayer Frey who loves to use the MC as a fashion model. She has nice tits. The dorky bespeckled researcher Mineru...she has nice tits. There’s a loli, because why not. There’s a cute mysterious kuudere grill in Serene - ofc with pale blue hair, and a fiery tomboy with crimson red hair with tsun tendencies. Basically all the popular fantasy girl templates are present in the show - truly someone for everyone of the proud degens who watch the program. <br />
<br />
The young main character - and I mean young, he&#039;s twelve, may be a turn off for many who prefer their harem leads to be peers to the girls that pursue their balls. Afterall most people who watch this program will be double the age of Koushi. But this does tap into a fetish that many degens have of seeing young, submissive leads receiving a crash course to puberty by the aggressive and fully developed beauties that surround them. Is it morally wrong for a twelve year old to be in such an environment? Yeah. But that&#039;s part of the appeal, I think, as being told something is forbidden can make it more tantalizing.<br />
<br />
The immediate comparisons for this show are Asa Made Jugyou and, more recently, Sunohara-sou no Kanrinin-sa. Both revolved around a timid young boy surrounded by gorgeous girls who all find him adorable and crave his attention. Neither of these harems truly “went” anywhere insofar as intimacy or a conclusive ending, because that’s never the point of these shows, only to endlessly tease and explore the possibilities of what could occur in this fantasy scenario.<br />
<br />
This however does raise a fair complaint concerning the cyclical, sexually non-committal ecchi of this nature though - wouldn’t this premise be better executed as a hentai? If you were in this situation as the MC, would you be able to resist the open invitations to have sexuale relations with with these girls as the MC never does? This is a common “problem” with full immersion into the ecchi genre as the decision making of the MCs is consistently unbelievable, minus a few rare cases. This problem in and of itself is why I’d have to dock the score a bit, despite being a success in ways that an ecchi is intended to be.<br />
<br />
What you see is what you get here. This is very much so a derivative of past successes and isn’t reinventing the wheel in any shape or form. But because there is so rarely these days ecchi anime that are willing to be fully nude romps that showcases the female anatomy in ways the viewer wishes they could irl, this shines as a perverted wish fulfillment tool that harkens back to days where these types of shows were much more plentiful. For that reason it should be particularly celebrated as a recent success of the ecchi genre that has been starving for a bit for more bolder works.

    Look, I have never written a review for an anime. Heck, I have been tempted too but am just too lazy. When I clicked on Megami-ryou no Ryoubo-kun (Mother of the Goddess&#039; Dormitory), I knew my time had come. <br />
<br />
Every season, we are blessed with some sort of high-level ecchi or blatant porn, and this season we yet again say “I can’t believe it isn’t hentai!” In this show, we meet a young middle school kid who, after losing his house in a fire, now lives as the “dorm mother” to an all-female college dorm. <br />
<br />
Now I waited all 10 episodes before I wrote a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416712">
        review because I wanted to capture the truth of this show. I happen to enjoy hentai. That’s right people, hentai is cool. After seeing this anime, I realized that this was actually a blessing and was the pregame show to every sad person’s fapping session. HOWEVER, this anime is basically something I would find in the shota category down the street at hanime, and to me it seems like the author is stuck in some fantasy of himself as a middle schooler drowning in upper college level students&#039; boobs as they all find him attractive somehow. Before I go on further, I need to explicitly state my intentions when watching this show. 1: I enjoyed the show because the women were hot and pleasing to see. 2: The women mentioned happened to be naked and in lewd scenes that I also found pleasing to see. 3: The criticism in this review is solely to show a different perspective and also just look at it without bias despite me enjoying every “accident” the MC and the female characters got into. Now that that’s cleared up, here we go. <br />
<br />
This anime is pretty much like your average harem, with the cheap boob shots and under the skirt frames, but what really separates it from everything else is how they present the female characters. Each of the characters are “quirky” in some way, with a cosplay-fanatic, a mad scientist who hates clothing, a pro-martial artist who “came from a family of guys”, a girl who passes out at the sight of any male but the MC while gushing out a waterfall of blood (funny huh?), and a straight up moon-alien-girl thing. Oh, did I forget to mention his staple tsundere childhood friend joins the mix? Somehow, this show manages to wrap up whatever ideas the author was having while smoking crack and pleasing himself, into a nice, lovely, immoral, and overly sexualized middle school fantasy. To give you an example of this, there is literally a scene where one of the characters rubs her direct p*ssy on the MC’s back while “riding” him in front of little kids. Don’t get me wrong, it was hot, but in court I am going to have to legally say that was inappropriate.<br />
<br />
Overall, the music and art were good, the characters are “unique”, and the story was something that could have been good but instead was one of those dumpster-fires every season gets.  I would like to mention that the MC dynamic with the characters is one of the most unenjoyable things I have seen. The MC is a kid who each of the females see as a “little brother”. At one point they all want him to call them a “older sister” in a cute way. The anime abuses this barrier by having some of the females internally fight with themselves on how they see him and try to justify loving him because he is “mature for his age” (Note there are exceptions). Personally I found this annoying, because I wanted them to either fully decide if he was their “brother” or a potential lover (I know about the age gap but bear with me). I think the main things people should take from this are to come for fanservice shots and bombshell gorgeous women. To be honest, I am not sure how this show is not being cancelled by Karen’s on twitter, but for us hentai enjoyers we can’t complain.<br />
<br />
Giving it a score, I say:<br />
Story: 2<br />
A story that never really made sense from the start because somehow a 12-year old has no parents and is homeless without anyone looking for him, as well as no context given to us. In addition, the story could have been pretty good in a different genre than ecchi but was used instead here for the harem plot.<br />
Characters: 2<br />
The characters&#039; quirks were there for corny scenes, and their complexity is not really something people who wanna see straight-up hentai are going to care about. However, to some who are looking for some depth to their hentai, I would say this would be a great pick for you.<br />
Sound: 8<br />
The OP was fire, and was one of my favorites this season (can’t beat Crybaby though). The music in the show was nice, but i&#039;m not a fan of the ED<br />
Art: 6 Some standard animation, nothing special<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
I came here for ecchi and got ecchi, and I am not the type of guy who is gonna decline seeing this.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7<br />
I actually enjoyed watching this, because let’s be honest, some of the scenes were amazing. The animation style was pleasing to watch, as it did its job in capturing the characters’ beauty. I wanted my R+ in nudity and it was delivered. Despite the ecchi I was here for, the anime is actually painful to watch if you actually pay attention to the story meaning the show can’t really go past a 6 even though it&#039;s honestly worse than that. However, if you are an individual who has been seeking for a shota anime all his/her life, this is a 10/10 and the perfect anime for you! For those who are interested in females, look no further, as every single female in the show has G-cups or above and are naked like 75% of the show. <br />
<br />
This is my first review on MAL lmk what you guys think.<br />

    This is a rewrite of a review I had before but it got taken down because I was hating, so here&#039;s an updated version<br />
As of right now Megami-ryou no Ryoubo-kun has had a quite a bit of praise from all the reviews that I have seen and I am here to provide a different opinion as I did not enjoy this anime as much as everybody else did<br />
Note: mild spoilers<br />
<br />
The anime starts of with our 12 year old mc on the brink of starvation as his house burned to the ground. He is left behind by his family for some reason and one event leads

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411524">
        to another and he ends up being like a kind of nanny for a girls dormitory where pretty much all the girls are very unique in their own way. This eventually leads to multiple misunderstandings and very intricate situations which don&#039;t always turn out well for our mc.<br />
Some of the problems I have with this series is that of morals or just loop holes that the series left that I don&#039;t particularly understand <br />
<br />
1)The fact that mc 12 and he gets into odd situations with people over the age of 18 doesn&#039;t sit right with me<br />
<br />
2) I&#039;m still very confused as to why his family left him behind, maybe there was something I missed or I wasn&#039;t paying much attention at the time but it boggles my mind that a 12 year old was left homeless<br />
<br />
3) In like episode 2/3 one of the girls is hella strong and destroys part of the house and it is magically restored by one of the other girls. I feel like this part should of been elaborated a bit further as it left me very confused and it was never mentioned again <br />
<br />
Story 4:<br />
nothing too crazy and it has quite a few loopholes<br />
<br />
Characters 4: <br />
nobody really stands out and none of them have an interesting complex character not that its needed for this type of anime<br />
<br />
Sound 8:<br />
honestly opening and ending were really good and I bopped to them quite a bit<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 4:<br />
Honestly the series had it&#039;s moments but it doesn&#039;t really appeal to me but I can see why one would like this series<br />
<br />
Over 4/10

    Anime with ecchi and fanservices meant for entertainment, why need to take it seriously?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s another common trope in harem romance where we have a cute,polite,good kid everything you could imagine manner you could say in a perfect mc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story 7/10 just a typical harem where the mc just lost his house and un(expected)ly started to live in a dormitory where its a girls dormitory.<br />
<br />
Characters - so far its just building up the story on how they end up in that dormitory, Selene is my best girl out of all , idk why they sometimes change the characters name that based on manga , well i dont

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411389">
        mind for some reason it doesnt bother my experience watching the anime.<br />
<br />
Older sisters in Harem in the fun of this harem,<br />
there you have a matured jokes that definitely crack the scene.<br />
and some sort of drama will also do the story.<br />
<br />
im feeling this could be more wholesome , because &quot;I read the manga&quot;

    Mother of the Goddess’ Domitory is one of the most bizarre shows that I&#039;ve watched this season particularly due to how the show presents it’s material. <br />
<br />
It doesn&#039;t take a galaxy brained genius to figure out that this show is basically paedophilia with extra steps, 80% of the show is just a 12-year-old kid being molested by big boobed women it&#039;s fucking creepy and extremely uncomfortable. I&#039;m not overly familiar with eechi genre but this show almost has every eechi trope that I&#039;m aware of.<br />
<br />
But what&#039;s particularly strange is how the show attempts to present this material in a somewhat satirical manner, I feel like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416714">
        the creator of this series deliberately added an age gap between for comedic purposes, let&#039;s just say it didn&#039;t work everything is so poorly timed, it&#039;s hard to haha funny laugh out loud while simultaneously feeling extremely uncomfortable. <br />
<br />
The comedy is basically just:<br />
<br />
1. Main character and *insert female from show here* are conveniently misplaced.<br />
2. Main character gets close to that characters boobs and feels uncomfortable.<br />
3. Rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
Another aspect of this show that I hate involves the character Sutea. Sutea is an angry Tsundere around the same age as the main character and serves as a somewhat romantic interest for him, which is fine whatever. The problem is that the show shamelessly sexualises her almost on the same level as the older characters and it&#039;s fucking gross. There&#039;s one moment during the beach episode that I don&#039;t even feel comfortable writing about but if you&#039;ve seen it you know.<br />
<br />
This show hardly has any redeeming qualities if not any, the none eechi moments are painfully mediocre, just characters doing miscellaneous things, nothing special. It&#039;s boring! <br />
<br />
Art is mediocre and the music is about what you&#039;d expect from a seasonal in this day and age.<br />
<br />
Basically the content in Mushoku Tensei that made a decent amount of people dislike that show, the entirety of Mother of the Goddess dormitory is just that on steroids.<br />
<br />
Is this show worth it? If you&#039;re a mega hardcore eechi fan then maybe. If you just wanna get your MAL mean score down then also maybe.<br />
<br />
(This is my first review on MAL I might write more if I get the confidence to.)<br />

    So honestly this anime is built different. Like I get how weirdos can enjoy this but the constant sexual assault and 12 years old panties in my face makes me want to throw up.<br />
<br />
The main character is a victim but at least he isn&#039;t dumb and was fairly well written but most of the girls were just typical poor character development. <br />
<br />
The lack of personality is insane and the over the top boob shots is was carried the anime. Overall, wouldn&#039;t recommend and btw Mark is dumb. <br />
<br />
Breakdown:<br />
<br />
Story (3):<br />
The story honestly makes no sense. Can&#039;t understand how his dad just simply abandoned him for no

          <span style="display: none;" id="review412699">
        reason and where is his mother? At least spend a little time explain what truly happened or show that his dad leaving him behind for an actually reason. Not just him getting abandoned then boom now he is becoming a dorm mother. <br />
<br />
Art (8):<br />
The art was actually fairly well, the time spent on detail was good and you can clearly see that they took the time to make it semi realistic (Like how their bodies were shaped).<br />
<br />
Sound (6):<br />
I mean.... sound is sound<br />
<br />
Character (3):<br />
Bro Serene is the worst character in the show. The whole concept off her being an astronomy girl completely overshadows her becoming anything else. I don&#039;t like how they excuse most of their actions with making Koshi view them as &quot;big sisters.&quot; Most of them are bland with no personality. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (1):<br />
This is gonna put me on a watch list. Pain....<br />
<br />
Overall (4):<br />
I can&#039;t recommend this to anyone. If you like it, you like it but most would run away.

    It&#039;s very easy to hate generic harem anime, because of the copy-paste nature the industry love, people get tired when they see the same thing pop up again and again.<br />
<br />
However, I could not reason myself to use such criticism to rate anime, not anymore that is. If the idea works once, it should work multiple times, just a few changes here and there (so long as it isn&#039;t too ambitious), give it a title of its own and you&#039;re good to go.<br />
<br />
Mother of the Goddess&#039; Dormitory falls into this situation. It&#039;s easy to hate, but you gotta remember that people will love these anime endlessly,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416691">
        and in the perspective of such, sure, it isn&#039;t the best harem in the world, but it is still pretty good.<br />
<br />
The story is episodic in which follows the lives of the protagonist, Koushi, in his newly found home after he found himself in the wrong anime (Fire Force). Most of the episodes are/contain what you are probably already expecting, y&#039;know, your beach episodes, school festival, guy falls over and touches tits for the 17th time, all that junk. I suppose in itself it isn&#039;t the most creative thing on Earth, but the anime does a good job at allowing the viewer to be invested in the marriage of its own gimmicks added to it, like that crazy scientist, cosplay girl, kuudere outta this world, and that ninja girl. It made for some pretty funny moments I didn&#039;t think were going to come in honesty. One more thing I will go on about with the characters is how they also had some underlying story to their name, it doesn&#039;t see the light of day often, but when it does it is a nice touch to add onto for them. In some sense, it probably heightens enjoyment when you see your favourite character become more detailed, don&#039;t hope for too much though.<br />
<br />
The audiovisuals are pretty dry, it&#039;s basically every box standard 2015-ish time anime. Literally nothing more to disclose on that superficial matter. However, I will point out how the animation sometimes benefits this anime, particularly of its kind. When it is slapstick as it is, things get surreal to the point of it making the anime funnier than it already is, what you may find &quot;lazy animation&quot; can actually be looked at as part of the comedic atmosphere this anime has for itself, though, I&#039;d imagine this is true for a lot of other anime, not that I remember.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, I enjoyed this anime a lot more than I thought was plausible. I found myself laughing at the antics and tomfoolery way more than I should have. The anime also has some self-awareness to it which makes it funnier to view. I mean, it is just boobs at the end of the day, kinda makes sense that it will do anything to get there, especially how they are explicitly shown.

    Every season this year, there’s that one single anime on the list which you can’t believe it’s not hentai.<br />
Winter 2021 gave us Mushoku Tensei and Redo- that’s already hentai mate.<br />
Spring 2021 gave us Higehiro<br />
And now, Summer 2021 gave us Mother of the Goddess Dormitory<br />
<br />
I’m not gonna lie, this is the first ever ecchi anime that I watch where there are nipples. I haven’t watched DxD or Redo just yet because I am scared that my parents will catch me watching lewd anime shit but I’ve thought, what if I watch it secretly? And that’s what I did. <br />
<br />
You can think of Goddess Dormitory as a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411382">
        SoL anime as well since it basically revolves around the life of a 12 year old shota who’s also somehow the mother of the dorm. Well at least he gets paid... right...? <br />
Well yeah he gets paid with horny ass girls of the dorm swinging their boobas around and getting smooshed by their asses. <br />
<br />
The OP of this anime is the best I’ve heard this season. It just gets me dancing for whatever reason. I love it.<br />
If you’re horny as hell like me, well you’d definitely enjoy this “anime” because there’s BOOBA and let’s be honest here, who doesn’t love booba? Apart from those, I also think this is hilarious and we also have Taiga 2.0 I guess?<br />
<br />
Yeah. <br />
<br />

    To sum it up, it&#039;s a shota ecchi anime about a 12 year-old that ends up taken in in the dorm of 5 college girls, revolving mostly around comedy and fan service (even from other 12 year-olds). Even though the plot is completely ridiculous and plain, it&#039;s funny and enjoyable enough.<br />
<br />
Story: little to none at all, it feels more like a bunch of random things thrown together without any reason. 3/10<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10, it&#039;s good and it suits well the type of anime it&#039;s meant for.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10, both the OP and ED were actually good.<br />
<br />
Character: you&#039;ve got the shy little boy surrounded magically by girls and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416700">
        girls only (and boobs), the crazy chemist that walks around naked, the shy pretty girl that has a men phobia, the cosplayer goth girl, the strong girl that likes to get physical, the cat-like white-haired girl that is a bunny princess or something (?) and the tsundere that doesn&#039;t know how to express her feelings. And (almost) all of them have big boobs, obviously. 2/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10 and overall: 6/10.<br />
<br />
If you like shota and seeing boobs 10 times per episode, this might be the perfect match for you. If you just want to have a good time with a fun anime without any deep plot (and you don&#039;t mind any of the things mentioned before) then this might be a good match for you as well. We&#039;re all here for a good time, not a long time, right?

    Degenerates unite! A new generic harem ecchi has arrived! A show where nudity exposure carries the show all on its own. <br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for an interesting plot this is not the show for you. This is all about getting the main protagonist which is a child if I may add into compromising positions with the beautiful voluptuous girls at the Goddess Dormitory.<br />
<br />
But is Megami-ryou no Ryoubo-kun terrible? No, in fact, it looks okay, the cast is actually pretty decent and Koushi is a reasonably good lead when considering the context. The ecchi scenes are outright laughable, they make no sense whatsoever but ultimately provide

          <span style="display: none;" id="review412878">
        a scenario where the girls can shine.<br />
<br />
But if you&#039;re like me and are kind of bored of anime because of the same generic shows being reproduced with different names. Well, this is the show for you where you can turn off your brain and have a great time ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

    &quot;Why need plot when you have PLOT?&quot; <br />
<br />
This anime is a masterpiece! Sure if you go expecting deep characters and plot twists you&#039;re not going to get it but in terms of ecchi anime this is one of the best! I&#039;ve never had so much fun since watching To Love RU Darkness. If you are an ecchi fan then everything you need from an ecchi show is right here!<br />
<br />
The girls in this show are epic! Each of them are crafted based on a certain character archetype but manage to feel refreshing and new. Their boobs are great too, so there&#039;s that.<br />
<br />
The show opens with PLOT

          <span style="display: none;" id="review412875">
        itself so what more can you ask? I really wish this gets noticed a lot.<br />

    For clarity, at the time of writing this review, only four episodes have been released, and I have seen them all.<br />
So, this show...<br />
Do you want ecchi/softcore p? 10/10.<br />
Do you want a story, with deep, well developed characters? 2/10<br />
Do you want fantastic art and/or sound? I&#039;ll give it a 5.<br />
<br />
Despite all how that sounds, I&#039;m giving the show a 5/10 so far. The art style is fine but standard. The story is shallow but the show doesn&#039;t try to pretend it&#039;s about any deep story. This show is well and truly all about fan service. Butts, boobs, and pantsu. That&#039;s all there truly is to it.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411646">
        If that&#039;s what you&#039;re in the mood for, you&#039;ll find it here, and you&#039;ll love it.<br />
<br />
Me? I&#039;m a trash panda, I eat trash like this because.. well, I just do. 5/10, and given the shows current direction, I have absolutely no reason to believe my rating will change. Not amazing in any way, but taking into account that it makes no false pretence over what it is, not bad either; it just is what it is.

    Megami-ryou no Ryoubo-kun. So another ecchi themed anime has ended and to be honest , this is something that a guy with high libido would enjoy and we look forward for another season, who know as to what another ecchi theme anime would be coming up.....so without further adieu, here are my raating for this 10 episode anime. <br />
<br />
Story-Mediocre 5: Ok so the plot here involves a 12 year old boy who has experience something tragic in his life given that he has a not good Otosan who&#039;s knee deep in debt and the apartment which was the only sanctuary left for our MC got

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416910">
        burned down and thus our MC finds himself homeless living day by day eating only scraps that can be found in thrash bin, till one day lol and behold just as he about to die on the pavement he sees a piece of haven in a form of purple panties which is worn by a hot hustling genius woman who brought him in their place of sanctuary and yes it&#039;s the Goddess Dormitory, in which it was in disarray and someone is needed to manage the disarray and yes it was our MC to the rescue, but not after encountering some hostilities from one of its members who has a problem with men.....So how does this story plot stack up.....well, it doesn&#039;t since the plot was obviously taken from another anime &quot;Happy Lesson&quot; which involves older harem members to younger male character and just like the usual, they tweak it a little, give them Japanese knack for plagiarizing.<br />
<br />
Art-Good 7: For a while there have been 2 version of this anime, there&#039;s the censored and the uncensored now give the knack of guys with big libido, well, it won&#039;t be a surprise, given that this has ecchi in it, this series be it manga or anime simply relies a lot on the fanservices to sell.<br />
<br />
Sound-Good 7: That for the opening theme and the character&#039;s voices that don&#039;t need to mask as if they&#039;re Joshikausei&#039;s except one girl who is a Chugakasei, her voice clearly doesn&#039;t match that as a middle schooler, the guy having a female voice I might understand but the girl in middle school to sound like a 20 something was just ill fitted. <br />
<br />
Character-Mediocre: Ok so lets what we have, for starters let&#039;s not for get that this series was closely related to &quot;Happy Lesson&quot; let&#039;s go over each of them:<br />
<br />
Koshi Nagumo- In a version of Sususmu Arisaka who&#039;s a young guy whose parents where no where to be found, a typical nice guy and as usual a typical harem guy with a sotacon harem. TBH, given that he&#039;s 12 years old means that he is still a kid, while Sususmu Arisaka from &quot;Happy Lesson&quot; was already in his mid teens....the only thing that was different of the 2 one gets to grope his sotacon harem, though always accidentally that is, while the other never gets to touch any of his sotacom harem.<br />
<br />
Wachi, Mineru - Basically she has all the geniuses of Kisaragi &quot;Ki-chan&quot; Ninomai from &quot;Happy Lesson&quot; but characteristicwise, she is alternate version of the latter, cu&#039;z while Ki-chan was more like a kuudere, Mineru was more like a combination of an teasing deredere, with a combination of bakadere due to the fact that she&#039;s also called &quot;Walking Toxic Gas Emitter.&quot; but most of all she&#039;s one genius who has a high interest in science to which she isn&#039;t the nerdist type rather she a type where she&#039;s a go getter with a hot body, Ki-chan from Happy Lesson was simply boring, and doesn&#039;t do enough to attract a guy.<br />
<br />
Frey- If she and Uzuki Shitenno from &quot;happy Lesson were to meet, these two will definitely get along very well, since bother were cosplayers and have the same amount of air headness give that the two were a bit of a bakadere who live in a world of fantasy......the only thing that these two would disagree on, is how Uzuki would envy Frey&#039;s bodacious body.<br />
 <br />
Serene Hozumi- The closes she match for her is  Sanzenin, Yayoi, given that both have that mysterious aura that exist to both of them....however Serene was the most mysterious than Yayoi, give that the original creator  Hino, Ikumi often gives a lot of mixed signal about her character except ,that just like the rest of the tenants of Goddess dormitory she too is also a tease.<br />
<br />
Senshou, Kiriya- Characterwise she closely matches Gokajou, Satsuki from &quot;Happy Lesson&quot; give that bother have that bokuko attribute, the only difference was Kiriya was more on the mellow side while Satsuki was more on the aggressive side..... but, both don&#039;t compete that much for the MC&#039;s affection.<br />
<br />
Saotome, Atena- Ok, just like Ichimonji, Mutsuki both really do care for the MC, but when it comes to how they do it, Mutsuki does it like a mom , while Athen does it like an Oneechan.<br />
<br />
Kouroya, Sutea - Basically she&#039;s a tsundere, while in Happy Lesson,  Fumitsuki Nanakorobi was more like a deredere , a tough as nails deredere, both were feared by the MC and wouldn&#039;t dare go against them.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, the characters here were just the usual from &quot;Happy Lesson&quot; in fact you could say that this 10 episode anime is ksut a risque version of &quot;Happy Lesson.&quot;<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-Poor 3: Let&#039;s face it this was just all about the fanservices, and frankly this can pass as a qusihentai if doing the female character would have been added.<br />
<br />
Overall Good 7: Given that this was only 10 episode long , I got give it to studio &quot;asread&quot; for the practical choice. Just limiting it to 10 episode meant, that the studio doesn&#039;t have any plans to further gets us audience to be too tired of it. <br />
<br />
IMAO, I ain&#039;t too keen for this anime to have a season two, since original creator, Hino, Ikumi, wasn&#039;t much of a story teller and was just too dependent on making something  raunchy, in fact this original works of his will have to compete hard in making it to the top ecchi genre.   <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    If you’re looking through the reviews of this series for reasons to not watch it, then honestly, I think you’re probably better off just not watching it. On the other hand, if you’re open to giving this series a shot, then I’m here to try and persuade you that it’s going to be worth your time. Because while this series appears to simply be your regular ecchi anime filled with overwhelming fan service, I personally think that there’s much more about it to love.  <br />
<br />
Right after reading the synopsis, you should already get the feeling that this series is a bit different from the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416830">
        usual tropes (unless, of course, you’re comparing it to something like Sunohara-sou). Firstly, none of the main characters are high school students. Instead, they are middle schoolers and college/university students, and in this case the middle schooler is the only dude so we’re pretty much closer to the safe end with regards to age-related discourse… but that’s a matter for another day. Anyway, due to certain circumstances, the kid moves into an all-female dormitory and starts his new life with some lovely company. Unlike a lot of other harem series, in Megami-ryou, not all the girls immediately or eventually fall in love with the main dude. It has a simple story filled with fun and wacky moments, and tinges of romance added in here and there. While they may have uniquely unorthodox traits, in general the girls’ characters are really natural, down-to-earth and befitting of college/university students, which makes them relatable to a certain extent. Pacing of each episode was good and overall the composition of the series was well planned out, making it easy to enjoy and understand. <br />
<br />
Needless to say, this series has a great amount of fan service, which is arguably the main focus and main attraction in the first place. Now, when it comes to the ecchi genre, people sometimes make complaints about those mysterious beams of light which appear within the anime, a phenomenon otherwise known as censorship. Naturally, this series does feature censorship as well. However, it also features not one, not two, but three different versions with three different levels of censorship – censored, uncensored, and “see-through” versions. While doing so doesn’t exactly make the series family-friendly, I feel that it shows just how much thought and effort the production staff have put into making this series potentially enjoyable for viewers. On that note, I was pretty satisfied with the fan service provided and felt it wasn’t too over-the-top, it complemented the comedic moments well and was rarely used unnecessarily. <br />
<br />
Majority of the seiyuus for the characters are new or relatively less experienced, but that did not affect my enjoyment of the series. In fact, it was rather refreshing to hear newer voices which I’m not accustomed to hearing from the tons of other series I have watched. In addition, this series also featured a separate “2.5D” cast, who cosplay as the characters and also sing the opening and ending themes. This is another commendable decision made by the staff and another special element for fans of the series to enjoy. <br />
<br />
In conclusion, if you love ecchi and fan service and want a series which won’t exactly take up too much of your time, this 10-episode series will most definitely be worth the watch. If you were on the fence, I hope that you can give it a try. Megami-ryou no Ryoubo-kun will be a series which you can simply switch off your brain and enjoy, with treats for the eyes, heart-warming moments and a whole lot of fun.

    Mother of Oppai.<br />
<br />
This seasons hentai disguised as an anime is Mother of the Goddess Dormitory and BOY is there are lot of &quot;plot&quot; in it. <br />
The plot is pretty simple. Abandoned by his father after their house burnt down, Koushi Nagumo ends up living on the streets until a college girl finds and hires him as a dorm mother to help look after the college women who live their as they&#039;re all incapable of looking after themselves. <br />
<br />
This show has some spicy &quot;plot&quot;. However, take away the &quot;plot&quot; and you&#039;re left with another boring slice of life anime with not much to offer other than

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416806">
        honkers occasionally. The women of the dorm all have their wacky personalities and quirks, but there&#039;s really nothing more too them past that.    <br />
It is troubling to see college girls (age 18-20 I&#039;m guessing) harbouring romantic feeling for a 12 year old. It is also troubling when his childhood friend and classmate Sutea Kouroya (who is also 12) is caught up amongst the &quot;plot&quot; with everyone else. There is a scene (I shit you not) where a fish tries to swim up her velcro triangle and says &quot;Finally, a place I can feel at piece.&quot; <br />
The fish didn&#039;t say that. I made that up, but I imagine that&#039;s what it would&#039;ve said.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s not really much else to say. Unlike Redo of Healer which takes itself way too seriously for what it is, Goddess Dormitory doesn&#039;t get a 1/10 because in it&#039;s awfulness it accidentally comes off as being hilarious and that gives it value. Not all of it is funny though. As I said before if you take away the &quot;plot&quot; it becomes extremely dull to watch, but at least in it&#039;s attempts to titillate it&#039;s not taking itself too seriously and that is much appreciated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Plot&quot; 10/10 Thumbs up<br />
Actual score 2/10 Bad  <br />

Honestly, I don&#039;t know what I expected.  I saw the poster and the premise, and it reminded me, a lot, of Miss caretaker of Sunohara-sou, which is an anime that aired in 2018.  I expected trash, and I got exactly what I wanted...maybe with a little bit more.  I mean, not much more.  But ya know, a little bit.  I guess.  Maybe? I&#039;m not gonna live, I loved this show.  I loved every trashy, horny second of it.  I loved it so much that I gave it an 8 on MAL, which is one point

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416790">
        above Miss caretaker of Sunohara-sou.  It&#039;s one of the most purely enjoyable anime of 2021 so far.  <br />
<br />
Now, before we get into this, yes, it is trash.  It was created for the sole purpose of watching with your pants off and...something in your hand.  Let&#039;s not try and kid ourselves here.  However, I do have to say, that&#039;s shockingly not the only reason to enjoy it.  Mother of the Goddess&#039; Dormitory is 50&amp; horny, and 50%...surprisngly heartwarming and wholesome.  Yes, really.  I&#039;m not kidding.  <br />
<br />
I love these characters.  All five of the college girls in the dorm, the protagonist, Koushi, and Koushi&#039;s childhood friend and kinda, sorta love interest, the resident Tsundere, Sutea, are all unique from each other.  My favorite is Atena, as I think she&#039;s the best looking, but also she has the most enjoyable personality, and actually has a little bit of depth, which the others really don&#039;t.  Due to some past experiences witih men when she was younger, she is terrified of men; so terrified, that blood bursts from her nose and faints whenever she gets to close to a man.  <br />
<br />
And at first, Koushi was included.  So much that when the other girls announce that Koushi was goin to live with them, she was prepared to leave the house and go out on her own.  However, then Koushi goes and tells her to head back to the dorm and he&#039;ll leave instead, as he didn&#039;t want to push her out of the home that she lived in first.  Later that night, Koushi is sleeping on a bench, freezing, and Atena finds him and takes him back to the dorm, telling him that it&#039;s okay if he stays there, and she won&#039;t leave either.  <br />
<br />
After that, throughout the series, we get to see her get closer to Koushi, despite him being a man.  By the end of the series she still has a long ways to go when it comes to her complicated relationship with men, but she had a genuine character arc, which is something I didn&#039;t expect in this damn series.  <br />
<br />
I also love Koushi.  He&#039;s such a selfless, sweet boy.  Even though his house burned down and he ended up on the street, he doesn&#039;t tell Sutea, his childhood friend, because he doesn&#039;t want to burden her, even though she says later that she would have been willing to help him out.  And when Atena is about to leave the dorm because of him, he decides to leave instead.  Despite everything that&#039;s happened to him, he kept an optimistic outlook, and cares for others.  I don&#039;t know how realistic this is, but it&#039;s definitely inspiring, and it makes him very likeable, if a bit naive.  But he&#039;s 12, so it&#039;s acceptable.  <br />
<br />
My least favorite character is probably Sueta.  I don&#039;t hate her, but she ended up being a pretty standard Tsundere.  I do like that there are times when we get to hear her inner thoughts, regretting not being able to tell Koushi how she feels about him; with most Tsunderes it takes a long time for us to actually get anything like this.  And some of her antics did make me laugh, but not many.  The cheapest moment regarding her has got to be when the two of them have one of those standard trip and falls and he winds up on top of her, and her clothes are partially removed.  At first, she started to move his hand closer to her breast, and I thought this would end up being a very unique Tsundere moment...but then she just kicked him away like usual, and i was let down.  <br />
<br />
The other characters are somewhere in the middle, I don&#039;t love them or hate them, but all of them are very sexy, and have a lot of funny scenes, which is obviously the most important aspect of this anime anyways, so mission accomplished.  Like I said before, I was shocked by how many wholesome and heartwarming moments are int his anime, almost every episode has at least one of them.  The last episode in particular was the mos touching to me.  It shows that Koushi has basically became family to these girls, like a little brother, and they&#039;ll always look out for him.  <br />
<br />
However, let&#039;s not kid ourselves, the primary purpose of this show is the fanservice.  And it delivers.  Definitely watch the uncensored version.  There&#039;s three versions, censored, semi-censored, and uncensored, and the uncensored version is obviously the way to go.  I mean, why watch an ecchi anime in any state other than uncensored?<br />
<br />
Final Score - 8/10

    Disclaimer: The review contains mild spoilers about the show, but is aimed at people who both have and haven&#039;t seen the show.<br />
<br />
Megami-ryou is the kind of show where you know exactly what you&#039;re going to get and whether you&#039;ll enjoy it or not before you&#039;ve even watched it. Ecchi situation (probably with tits) happens, rinse and repeat. As long as you&#039;re fine with ecchi and shota content, you&#039;ll enjoy it. That being said, I think this show has a little bit more going for it that pushes it past generic ecchi fare and into an actually enjoyable show.<br />
<br />
On a base level the characters are as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416730">
        you expect from this kind of show, each of them has a singular main trait that gets used as a vehicle for the majority of the ecchi situations they get involved in with our main character Koushi. Frey, for example is an avid cosplayer and often dresses up herself or other characters (including Koushi himself) in slutty costumes which inevitably leads to ecchi moments. And for a lot of the show, she is very straightforward in using almost every opportunity she can to tease Koushi. But there are occasional moments where she takes a step back from the ecchi and shows that there&#039;s actually something more to her character.<br />
<br />
Throughout the show via living at the dorm Koushi, who never had a proper family before, learns how it feels to truly have one for the first time, but over time these thoughts shift into more romantic ones. These conflicting feelings leave him at a crossroads, between these feelings and wanting to continue with this status quo now he&#039;s finally found a place he belongs. So, in the end, he decides to bottle up these feelings inside him. <br />
<br />
Frey notices this and uses her usual vehicle for ecchi, cosplay, for a completely different reason. She gets Koushi to cosplay with her and utilising the aspect of freedom it gives allowing people to act as the characters and not as themselves to force Koushi to confront his feelings in a surprisingly well directed scene given what&#039;s expected from this kind of show. <br />
<br />
Honestly, this scene is probably one of my favorites of the entire season and it&#039;s moments like this that, as mentioned before, in my opinion gives the show something extra over the usual ecchi show. Not every character gets development like this however, but for the ones that do, while nothing revolutionary, it&#039;s generally well done enough where it makes them feel like actual characters as opposed to just being there to create those ecchi moments and makes you want to root for them in their pursuit of romance with Koushi.<br />
<br />
The combination of each character&#039;s quirk, the general mayhem in the dorm, and these bits of actual characterisation create an enjoyable cast of characters. Such that you can understand why Koushi feels that he&#039;s found somewhere he belongs. And also leads to some enjoyable comedy getting at least a couple of chuckles each episode. <br />
<br />
Production wise this show is nothing special, but does what it needs to, the character designs are hot enough for the ecchi scenes to work and the other visual elements are acceptable enough to where they don&#039;t distract from the show.          <br />
<br />
For the most part this show follows the ecchi script, but it occasionally stepping slightly outside the bounds makes it feel that it has something more than most ecchi shows. Leading to a show with a fun atmosphere, entertaining characters, and a pretty enjoyable experience overall (with added tits).<br />
Score: 7.5/10
