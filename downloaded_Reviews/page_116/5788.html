    Mwz is different from another mobile game adaptation, yes its base on game but Its more like to call it as original series. While developed MW game, Klab want to made anime which would realeased together with global release game. Theres no another main purpose beside just to promote the game. Surprisely, mwz turned out to be  the series which has its own identity, even klab added anime&#039;s characters and story  into the part of new game&#039;s arc.<br />
<br />
This low budget series is produced by Yokohama lab which is small new studio, Naoto Hosoda was picked as a director, a series composition, and as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review365990">
        a scriptwriter, 3 jobs in one hand. He said Klab gave him freedom to make his own story, thats why he make it more complicated like crime suspense overseas drama. Mwz is set set 20 years before the game, so that the timing of the game start is linked to the end of the animation and can be see as single story. The director also said that to tell deep story, he has set up another main character who is a little older from the main character in the game as the original character,  because Leocadio the main character in the game are too young 20 years ago in anime. The character designer said as for Imanuel there was an order not to make him too handsome, and she drew it such as quirky face as well as beautiful shape. When i saw the game, i wonder, in anime not only the story is deeper and darker but the character design visual is very different from the game, seem like Naoto Hosoda aimed the mature story so all the original character in anime look mature and not trying to be cool, if its for profit and gain attention from many viewer i thought the character design from the game more captive to alluring the viewer, more moe and typical visual from fantasy chara. But no, the director want to make a mature anime, his own anime lmaoo. When looking the game visual again, its like final fantasy, so the typical adaptation from the game usually would be like another isekai fantasy anime and look like typical light novel adaptation, but no , mwz is not adaptation, is base on game but it turned out to be dark suspense with political intrigue. It&#039;s too brave and very experimental to not following the original source.<br />
<br />
 The story itself look like  AOT without titan &amp; 3d manuever or Code Geast without robot and anti-hero mc  instead it has human experiment and monster and dinosaurus lol, mix those with Baccano element. MWZ&#039;s story probably set in 19th Century from visual, background, and clothes similar with steampunk anime, and at alternate German from its title. It has good background and the part i like is the corner of road hallway among the building. There are two main character in this series, one of main character is not typical protagonist, seems like he is coward but he turn out to be reliable compare to mc from another original series this season, Akudama Drive&#039;s mc  Swindler has the same situation accidentally got carried away and become an Akudama while Inummael become a smuggler of Headkeeper, but imagine in MWZ is not Swindler who is the MC but Hoodlum. Inummael&#039;s weird facial expressions also always awaited throughout the episodes, the anime maker are really want to make him not cool. MWZ also have one of the best antagonist this year, Herman&#039;s character is really creepy.<br />
<br />
Although it is clearly seen that  they have low budget from anime&#039;s OP and ED, but their songs are really good, Maon Kurosaki&#039;s operatic song is really suit with this series theme even if the OP&#039;s animation is just siluet, and the ED song also really suit though its only dark scene with credit,  its like OP and ED from american tv show, IMO its better than Raised by wolves&#039; OP.<br />
<br />
The plan and production itself is only spend time 2 years from 2018, animation probably not as good as another original anime this year if we want to compare it, because MWZ is like more original series, usually an original series production take a longer time than adaptation series, it can be 4-7 years to make it, but MWZ storyline is one of the best for original this season or this year, its really well written and dark.<br />

    If there is one way to sum this show as a whole, it is the love-hate relationship of director Naoto Hosoda. Take one look at his hit-or-miss work repertoire of anime production over the years, and I&#039;d guarantee that you either love or hate the shows he&#039;s worked on (the more notable ones): Hataraku Maou-sama!, Juuni Taisen, Mirai Nikki, Shuffle!, even Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete. And now, this show being another addition onto the reputable director&#039;s works, and I can finally understand why.<br />
<br />
Magatsu Wahrheit: Zuerst, translated: Ominous Truth: the First, based on the mobile game of the same name (but without the Zuerst).<br />
<br />
If you have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370622">
        no idea what to understand of this mobage adaptation, I&#039;d like to refer you to the official anime website and check out the &quot;Specials&quot; tab, because that&#039;s where the magic of the show is based upon. The TL;DR is this: KLab Games offered director Naoto Hosoda a free pass to make up his envisioned story of Magatsu Wahrheit, so that both the anime and the game have a similar, overarching story, albeit a timeskip that still honours and establishes the core settings. Not to mention that Hosoda himself is a fan of western live-action and episodic, espionage drama, so it really nails in the niche look of the show that is a rarity in anime form. Not to worry if you&#039;ve been itching to play the game, because this show can be taken as a one-shot format of a prequel story.<br />
<br />
The Golden Rule technique of &quot;Show, Don&#039;t Tell&quot; is an art in and of itself, to which the story and characters are related through sensory details and actions. Rather than just ham-fisting readers/viewers with exposition, it fosters with the immersion build-up, allowing them to “be in the room” with the characters. And that&#039;s how Magatsu Wahrheit: Zuerst sets the scene for this show, which takes place 20 years before the game&#039;s beginning. Two young characters, seemingly unrelated to one another: Innumael, just an ordinary blue-collar worker, and Leocadio, a soldier in the Wahrheit Imperial Army. Through &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; that involves a highly-prized smuggled weapon, and tying both character&#039;s fate and destiny individually and together to fighting for what they believe is right with their lives, to the seemingly &quot;random&quot; characters of affiliations, the cat-and-mouse &quot;Two sides of the coin&quot; battle between organizations, cults and empires are truly a force to be reckoned with. Another Akudama Drive-type show, but in a historical military-esque setting that does the suspense well, and keeping up with the illusive foreshadowing of balanced pacing and exposition that defines both the anime and game as a single package. Props to Yuichiro Momose for co-supervising both the scriptwriting and screenplay with Hosoda.<br />
<br />
The characters are really interesting as well: Every single one of them is kept being purposeful to the plot that accumulates overtime, tantamount to the endings of stories with solid foundations that actually use their resources to the full. At first, you&#039;re left wondering why both Innumael and Leocadio, as young chaps as they can be, seem like fools in a river full of piranhas that have people creep up to them for their actions. But as the story progresses, as we play the &quot;Guessing Game&quot; of theorized craftsmanship, it keeps the extremely tight pacing consistent, while fleshing out the execution of amounting pressures and tensions enough to keep you focused and invested. Every single decision and motivation made between all characters (as many and difficult as you can count and follow, besides Innumael and Leo) actually make sense that moves the story along, and doesn&#039;t make you feel like you&#039;ve wasted an inch of time on this show. That to me can be hit-or-miss, but it really keeps you on your toes of the next plot pointer(s).<br />
<br />
Some notable characters of a lightning round:<br />
- Both veteran VAs Asutshi Abe and Yuuki Ono were really good fits for both Innumael and Leocadio.<br />
- The one, the only veteran VA Kenjiro Tsuda, voicing Innumael&#039;s superior Captain Helman. The instaneously recognizable gangster voice dubbing a &quot;grim reaper&quot;-like character, that is the charismatic &quot;scummy&quot; voice we all know and love.<br />
- Character designs don&#039;t go as nice and well-drawn as Schaake Gutheil. A red-haired, green-eyes girl, and a member of the mysterious organization Headkeeper, she excels at being both serious and a bad-ass.<br />
<br />
The reason why I say notable is because this is newcomer Akiko Sugizono&#039;s debut anime doing character design all by herself. Having drawn only female characters, and it was a monumental task for her to draw and design male characters, and it was an insane challenge for her. Luckily, Naoto Hosoda also had dips in the formulation of the character designs, so it&#039;s a win-win on both sides of the story.<br />
<br />
The music is also another fascinating viewpoint. Director Naoto Hosoda explains that the show&#039;s voice-acting was done during the COVID season, so most of the Seiyuu have to do their recording remotely, as opposed to the regular sound-mixing studio where the entire cast will gather and do their recording all at once. As a consequence of the pandemic, it took 3 times as long for the entire cast to record their lines, but thanks to the veteran cast&#039;s skills and professionalism, along with sound director Kisuke Koizumi, the VA job is handled graciously. Add in another veteran of sound composer Masaru Yokohara (Kanata no Astra, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso), and wow, what a star-studded production team that is a blessing to add to the show&#039;s grimacing atmosphere.<br />
<br />
Maon Kurosaki attempting an opera-like OP, and H-el-ical// with another dark-edged ED, the OST does a pretty good job setting the mood and the theme of the series, matching its American counterparts of a classic visual opening and silhouetted black-screen ending with &quot;historically classical&quot; music.<br />
<br />
The elephant in the room is undoubtedly the mediocre visuals and animation, but it&#039;s a no-brainer of a surprise coming from the now 5-year-old studio, Yokohama Animation Laboratory. They did some ONA co-productions in the past, but it&#039;s not until Miru Tights that they branched out doing original work. Even with the KLab Games&#039; deal with Summer 2020&#039;s Lapis Re:Lights mixed-media franchise, these 2 shows showed potential for the studio to do low-budget animation that&#039;s a considerable pass. And everything about both shows can be applied here, just with a dark, cinematic tone (while sticking with KLab&#039;s dealership). In spite of the worsening animation (that&#039;s lucrative of a low-budget studio), the visuals do get the job done explicitly with art director Hirotsugu Kakoi at the helm, expressing the entire show in its own unique class.<br />
<br />
Despite a small production team of a mix between old and new staff, an S-Grade of a character voice-dubbing cast, and masterfully-crafted soulful music of veteran directors, honestly, this show stands on a marvel of its own merit. It&#039;s more than just your typical &quot;cash-cow&quot; mobage anime adaptation, and I feel that this is one of the few pedigrees of game adaptations that truly gets the formula right: beckoning anime-onlys to play the game to discover what the advertised game is all about.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m just going to say this: even if you have no intentions to check out the mobile game, this is a hidden gem of a must-watch. As I mentioned in the beginning: this is classic Naoto Hosoda storytelling at its finest, and it&#039;s expected that not a lot of people will like it (as evident by MAL scores), but please, give this a try.

    I feel like this show is getting missed upon honestly. It&#039;s really good and very enjoyable. I&#039;ll explain, but I hope my review encourages more to check out this show and what it is offering so far, as it&#039;s a thrilling roller coaster so far, and it has been very enjoyable. <br />
<br />
We start with the story, as we follow not just one, but two main characters, as they seem to be on the opposite sides. Though through different reasons, but that is just what makes it interesting already. It&#039;s not just a simple story of bad vs good, as there is more to it. Getting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review362611">
        the perspective of both sides, rather than mostly just one. Along with having possible foreshadowing moments that could lead to plot lines down the line that could prove to be very impactful.<br />
<br />
The characters on both sides are very interesting too. There is always something about them, the supposed bad guys seem like level headed people despite their deeds, while the supposed good law enforcement seem a little bit off, as if something is going on there. Which just adds more to the interest factor. While our two main MCs, they&#039;re both good in their own right, and it&#039;s interesting to see how they deal with the hand that has been given to them. Where it just be following a new job in law enforcement. Or having to go with the &#039;bad&#039; guys, all because of an incident, and handling all of that pressure. It&#039;s pretty intense. <br />
<br />
The art style can be gloomy at points, but more to fit the scenes of the show. But it can be clean and nicely coloured when it&#039;s more brighter scenes. Really well done there. Same can be said for the music, all of it really adds to the atmosphere.<br />
<br />
Should you watch this and give it a chance? Hell yes! It&#039;s very enjoyable, and I can see it becoming more so as it goes along!

    I don&#039;t know why the rating of others for this anime is so low, but I guess since this is not they&#039;re typical anime like harem, comedy, or fan service. This anime is so underrated, please ignore the rating here in MAL and try to watch this series and be the judge yourself.<br />
<br />
For introductions of this anime, there are 2-3 MCs, I guess, like they have different sides and views, and for me I can&#039;t choose only one of them to be the main MC since they have reasons of their own.<br />
<br />
The setting is, I guess, 19-20th century technology but with magic.

    This show is one of the best this season and my personal favourite. I love the world building, the setting, the character design and the suspenseful moments it delivers. No generic romance or fanservice to interrupt the flow of the story which is really well paced. I never had to check how many minutes are left, it&#039;s just so good.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s urban fantasy with no isekai elements or anything but great dark and engaging themes where you explore BOTH sides of these factions that seems to have understandable motivations as we explore their story further and further. There&#039;s good use of political intrigue, similar to ACCA

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370676">
        13, the setting of FMAB and it keeps you wondering at times.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a show that does visual world building and story-telling, you can understand the character motivations without them monologuing half the time to you and it&#039;s what I really want from shows like this. <br />
<br />
<br />
The characters of this series are really good and they all have their backstories and really distinctive personalities, even the smaller but very memorable characters like Schaake, Benjamin, Arnolt and Irma. <br />
<br />
Ultimately, the series kind of does a dual main character viewpoint with more weight on Inumanuel than Leo but both have their roles to play. Inu is my favourite MC of the year, he has this cowardly streak about him but it&#039;s really satisfying to see him grow and even though he can be a bit of a coward, his heart is always in the right place and this is what makes him so compelling to watch. The emotions are always on point with him, he alone can carry this show.<br />
<br />
<br />
Leocadio is also a very interesting character as he balances the morality of his actions against the logic of following an order, haunted by the tragedy on its past. And so many more other characters that we see their viewpoint from which makes the world so much more interesting, yet never feeling bloated at the same time.<br />
<br />
Music is awesome by composer of Gundam IBO and YLIA, background art is freaking awesome and this show was just made for me. The animation does suffer near the 2nd half of the series but honestly, the story carries the series very well and I much prefer a really good story than stellar animation. <br />
<br />
At the end, it&#039;s a pretty unique series, tackling serious dark urban fantasy themes with some supernatural elements, with an amazing and underrated cast of characters. This show deserves more love but at the end, give it a chance, it&#039;s a hidden gem for a reason.

    When was the last time we’ve gotten a truly serious heart-pumping, blood-rushing survival anime where the characters are facing a combination of the environment surrounding them as well as opposing humans? And when was the last time that the tension was so high that you sat stock still with bated breath, unable to move because you were that enthralled by what was unfolding before you? One more….. and when was the last time that an anime, having all of this, also included a massive conspiracy that was well thought-out, related entirely to the environment and setting, and had villains operating it that were actually fearsome

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370636">
        and not just plot devices?<br />
<br />
Honestly, I don’t think there’s ever been an anime like this. But there is one now, and it’s roared into the final season of 2020 like a pack of lions chasing after their kill. And honestly, that’s how it feels watching this show, as if you’re trying to escape from multiple things coming at you at one time and you gotta think of a way out fast, within milliseconds, and you need to constantly keep doing this, or else you’re fucking dead.<br />
<br />
That anime is ZUERST, obviously, an experience so totally unique to anime that the most comparable narrative and atmosphere to it, without giving too much away about the plot, is in fact the 2013 action-adventure, award-winning game “The Last of Us”. While there may or may not be structural similarities between the two in overarching narrative (again, I don’t want to spoil any of the plot for ZUERST because it’s just soooo thrilling), they both perfectly manifest the feelings of dread and fear of not being able to necessarily help others because it’s hard enough to help yourself in the first place when you’re on a constant loop of running for your life.<br />
<br />
Narratively, ZUERST is a perfect representation of “show, don’t tell”. There’s no exposition in this: it throws the audience into a familiar, yet unfamiliar world without explaining anything, instead leaving it up to them to discover what’s going on through context clues and interpreting what characters may indirectly imply about their situation. Further, everything develops organically, as if it’s actually unfolding in real time in front of the audience without any real “plot armor” or forced writing. There are multiple mysteries tied together among the expansive cast of characters which are not directly revealed to the audience, but rather can be both inferred and also predicted based on information the audience receives over time. Basically, foreshadowing plays a key role in keeping the audience engaged because there is enough to make accurate predictions about what is going to happen if paying attention, yet subtle enough that it doesn’t spoil any major plot points and will be often missed by the average viewer with not enough patience to keep a watchful eye out for the subtleties. One last thing – if you aren’t focused while watching, you will very easily miss key details that will leave you somewhat confused later in the story. I say this only because it speaks volumes to the importance of each and every scene of this story: there is NOTHING here that is filler or could be excluded without negatively impacting the plot and the flow.<br />
<br />
If this all sounds interesting enough already, a short analysis of the cast of characters will pique your intrigue even further. For starters, the main cast of characters are all clearly defined. The protagonist of the show is an interesting case and receives massive amounts of development throughout the show. How he progresses through scene after scene is very identifiable. Of course, the only way this would be super noticeable is if he changes massively as a character over time – which he does, and all for the better. But even though it’s like finding a horse in a haystack – very easy – his progression is way more defined than “very insecure at the beginning, strong and confident at the end”. The nuances of his progression, once again, can be seen over time. Some anime has one or two major scenes that change a character, causing it to feel somewhat forced. In ZUERST, this is not the case. Everything changes him, and this is apparent.<br />
<br />
The protagonist himself, while being the meat of the story, isn’t always the focus of every scene; rather, there are plenty of scenes that don’t include him. The group the protagonist finds himself joining forces with is also full of very defined characters with clear goals and objectives. They all come from relatively different backgrounds, but their shared common interests are what keeps them together and united for their purpose. Each character gets ample amount of screen time and are not just plot devices but actually relevant enough to the story to justify giving them the time of day.<br />
<br />
The antagonistic group also receives heavy focus. This is vastly different from 99% of other anime where every episode the main villain receives one scene where he’s maniacally laughing or sniveling and twisting his hands like a dumbass. Nay, the antagonistic force in ZUERST has just as much characterization and definition as the protagonist and his group. The head honcho, voiced by rising star Kenjirou Tsuda, is clearly a force to be reckoned with and not overpoweringly so. He’s got a clear motive for his actions, makes his own decisions even if they don’t align with his side, and his background is explored enough that one might be able to justify him turning into the “monster” that he has become. Meanwhile, his comrades have their own reasons for doing what they do, and all the actions that all of the characters take in ZUERST just make sense. There’s no dumb bullshittery or stupid decisions made; just characters doing what is in their own self interests. <br />
<br />
I could speak of the environment as a character, because it kinda is, and you’ll see why if you watch the show. But to go into that now would be spoilers, and it would be much more fun to find out what I mean if you just go watch yourself!<br />
<br />
The other major thing I want to focus on here is the art and animation. While the animation isn’t always top notch, what struck me immediately from the first episode was how fluid and consistent it is. There are no shortcuts taken involving quick cuts to avoid animating a sword being swung; instead, there’s lots of sword swinging, gun shooting, and running that for 85% of the time, looks smooth and very accurate. If I had to compare the animation of ZUERST to the typical seasonal show, I’d say it looks better than 90% of all seasonal anime. It’s definitely consistent.<br />
<br />
The art, however, is more than just consistent. It is INCREDIBLE. With this type of anime where the tension of trying to survive and uncover hidden truths is the key to making it feel right, the atmosphere is crucial towards relaying that tension. The shots in this anime do the wonderful story absolute justice. They are just so detailed, are extremely visually appealing, and really are the driving force behind the cohesive, immersive experience. They pull you into the world and keep you there, alongside the characters, as if you are right next to them!<br />
<br />
The most praiseworthy aspect of the art in ZUERST is by FAR AND AWAY the facial expressions of the characters. Never in my life have I ever seen a such diverse arsenal of facial expressions. Expressions are the key to making characters come alive, and never before have I felt such intense emotions from characters in an anime. When facial expressions cause your blood to run cold and chills to run up and down your entire body, you KNOW a show has succeeded at making you feel immersed and care about the characters. <br />
<br />
There’s so much more I could go into about this show, even without diving into spoiler territory, but I’ve already gone on for long enough, so I’ll leave off with one last thing:<br />
<br />
The soundtrack to this anime is glorious. That is all. If you love amazing soundtracks, watch this if only for that reason. <br />
<br />
There are plenty of reasons to love ZUERST. I legitimately couldn’t find a single reason to dislike it, and I was immersed enough to not even notice any mishaps or issues with the plot whatsoever. The animation and art by a low-budget studio for some reason blow 90% of other seasonal shows out of the water, even if the animation did decline over the span of the show.<br />
<br />
Director Naoto Hosoda has finally succeeded in creating a near masterpiece anime, and it is evident that his impact on the anime as a whole – the direction altogether being fantastic – was a huge reason. The scene composition, the framing, the shots, the seamless transitions: everything was just incredibly well-crafted.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is without any regrets whatsoever that I can say clearly: ZUERST is the best anime of 2020.<br />

    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
Magatsu Wahrheit is a mobile rpg game which I tried to play but since my cellphone is crap and mostly filled with apps that I need, I could only play the prologue before I had to uninstall it. From what I could play, the game is a generic rpg with generic plot, generic characters, generic gameplay and a generic no name no face self insert protagonist so why would anyone bother with its anime adaptation? Especially when anime based on videogames aren’t exactly good, King’s Raid from the same season is an example of that.<br />
<br />
Another reason to pass on this anime is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370888">
        the studio in charge of it, it’s pretty new and they did nothing of value as of yet, heck, the more famous work from them is Miru Tights, a short episodes comedy dedicated completely to a fetish.<br />
<br />
Something that caught my attention while playing the game is that the setting was more medieval than the anime, which combines fantasy elements with an european like setting with contemporary technology and clothes (not present day technology and clothes of course). Combining that with how different Leocadio looks in the game made me think that the anime was going for its own completely different story, well that’s because I don’t know german and thus I didn’t know that the Zuerst in the title means the first or beginning, meaning, it’s actually a prequel to the game.<br />
<br />
Anyways, Magatsu Wahrheit combines several elements from other shows of its season and year to grab attention, is based on a mobile rpg just like King’s Raid, it has an european like setting and messed up nobels like Moriarty the Patriot and a dual protagonist focus, just like…well, many other shows from this year (Moriarty, Deca-Dence, Runway de Waratte, BNA, to name a few). <br />
<br />
Its downside, I have to admit, is not being exciting, it plays out like a mystery instead of an action adventure and thus it has a lot of talking and investigation which are not going to thrill many viewers. <br />
<br />
On top of that the visuals are nothing like in the PV, they are weak in the beginning and downright pathetic towards the end, making it even duller to watch, the setting is pretty good looking, the backgrounds are well made, but almost everything else in the visuals falls apart completely. The character designs are terrible despite standing out a little from the norm, they lack detail, shading, lightning, they are not even completely drawn at times, and the qualily drops are making things worse, the characters barely look good because the artwork is weak and the in-between is poorly made and keeps giving them deformed faces in all of the episodes, especially the second and third to last.<br />
<br />
The motions are ok in the beginning, there’s a good fight in the first episode with a good choreography, but as the episodes goes on, they become worse and worse, the movements are very sloppy even in moments in relaxation, so just imagine how bad they are whenever there’s action. <br />
<br />
The special effects are overall ok when it comes to shots and magic but I have to admit that there were pretty looking moments such as a certain thing beneath the Capital and the explosión in the last two episodes which reminded me of Watchmen, blowing up everything and even showing the horrors of having people being dragged on by it. In general, the last episode is better animated than the rest, but not by much. <br />
<br />
I really should stop talking about the sound when I have nothing to say about it, voice acting is ok, nothing particular about it except for the fact that the distortion effect for the monsters is good, but there are at least 4 soldiers voiced by the same guy and his voice is weird and his acting not really convincing, sound effects are pretty good and impactful, the music is fine too, the ending is fine and the opening is pretty great, too bad modern audiences don’t seem to be very fond of instrumental or opera openings, don’t miss the 8 minute full version of it by the way, it has different sections and it’s completely different from the minute and a half version.<br />
<br />
The big plus of the show is having a conflict which is interesting yet simple on paper but multi layered on execution, here there are monsters appearing near the city and villages and killing people, the military have to take care of them on the Capital of the Empire and the Diet orders that every city has to protect itself however they can, thus they are unable to protect other places, which obviously makes the citizens and villagers unhappy and hostile towards them. <br />
<br />
There is a group of rebels that want to help the people to take down the monsters, there are episodes showing how the monsters attack the different places, as well as some episodes showing people about to die from a decease which they also try to find a cure for, there is the Diet that controls everything and they lead some sort of plan to take the Empire and they are also making experiments with people and turning them to monsters, with the idea of it being a next step in human evolution or something generic like that and the series does not shy away from showing some of these people losing control and attacking others, including their loved ones (like in Fog Hill of Five Elements) without censorship and there are double agents and traitors on both sides, which are of course shown investigating or plotting.<br />
<br />
All of the above as well as the way they are connected and the cause of it all is shown with a proper pacing and without much exposition, despite featuring lots of terms from the games, it’s nothing like other videogame adaptations where there are lots of exposition through talking nor complicated explanations of complicated terminology, everything is shown by the characters’ actions and interactions and the world building.<br />
<br />
Another plus is how neither side is shown as completely good or bad and how most if not every character seems to have their own agenda and doing something both on their own and as part of a group all the time. There are evil nobles like in Moriarty that rape their maids, get them pregnant, mistreat them and even lead them to suicide (this reminded me of Journey of Elaina by the way), as well as others that are part of the rebels and genuinely want to help the people. There are soldiers that are messed up in the head and are shown as ruthless and sadistic, and they like to torture, kill and beat others, as well as good soldiers that genuinely want to protect the citizens and becomes allies with Headkeeper once they learn the truth.<br />
<br />
There are characters such as the father of the red haired girl who seem clueless to the whole thing but they are actually doing something behind the scenes with also good reasons for doing so. And as I said earlier, there are traitors and double agents on both sides, that makes neither side to have complete advantage over the other nor be incompetent and there’s a somewhat high level of tension because of it.<br />
<br />
Another good thing is having two protagonists and having the narrative jumping between both of them and showing what both of them are doing all the time. Leocadio begins as a naive soldier with an idealized vision of the military and his learning about the shady and corrupt side of it, before deciding to practically turn against it, kill a superior, and stop the plans of the corrupt government alongside Headkeeper. Innumael is a normal worker who gets dragged by the whole thing by accident in a mostly believable way, beginning as a coward who only cares about his safety (which is understandable) before actually becoming a proper member of Headkeeper and wanting to help others, kinda like the protagonist of Akudama Drive, even becoming a wanted criminal in a similar way. Showing a bit of their backgrounds, their families, how they get involved in the conflict, the change in the interactions between the two of them as enemies at first and allies in the end was also a nice way to flesh them out. <br />
<br />
I have to admit though, that aside from them, every other character that seemed to be important at first gets a secondary role or disappear in the second half. The red haired girl is the prime example of that, she seemed to be a central part of the conflict at first, even showing a bit of her everyday life when they get back to the city, and then she gets kinda tossed aside in the final episodes, there’s a blonde guy who disappears after the fifth episode before sniping someone in the head in the last episode out of nowhere. There’s a kid that we never see again and so on. At least every death feels important because the show follows what everyone does most if not all the time.<br />
<br />
This has to do with the weird pacing the show has, it may feel slow in the beginning because it is not exciting but that was allowing for mostly everything to make sense and feel organic and believable with proper build up and treatment.<br />
<br />
That, and the fact that the amount of episodes was unknown until the show was two weeks to end, made me think that the series was going to be at least a two cour show ending in March of next year but that wasn’t the case, the series clearly speeds up in the second half and it starts using silly resolutions such as last moment saves from characters appearing out of nowhere with lazy explanations or the rebels easily infiltrating different places and posing as soldiers. This, alongside the book from the second episode and some unexplained things in the last episode, such as Leocadio’s seconds of power and Innumael’s plot armor, among other things, affect a little the credibility of the whole thing.<br />
<br />
With that said, there’s some sort of excuse for all of that, which is basically the Diet playing around with them because their plan was practically unstoppable and because they were basically setting a trap for them and capturing them for their experiments, yet I feel like Headkeeper should have known that, if that thing was beneath the capital, then the real light would appear there, making the explosion near the end somewhat avoidable. That’s why the finale will feel weird and unsatisfying, aside from being incomplete, it could have been avoided, and will definitely feel rushed, heck, the PV showed a fight between the two protagonists which never happened, so there’s definitely stuff that was cut off from the main series. <br />
<br />
That said, the finale is uncommon and somewhat refreshing for the side that wins in the end, as well as anticipated early on, but it’s definitely not a good one. Being a prequel to the game is not an excuse, for all the criticism Rogue One can get, the ending made sense for sending off the events of the original Star Wars and felt satisfying for everything that happened in the movie. Heck, in anime there’s Gundam the Origin which is an amazing prequel to the original series and fits almost perfectly within the timeline while still having a solid ending for its own story. <br />
<br />
In the end, Magatsu Wahrheit is basically the Deca-Dence of its season, a somewhat worth watching show, especially for being based on a videogame, with a mostly decent plot and a mosty decent cast of characters that was overlooked by many (if not most) people that sadly didn’t last more to tap all of its potential. I thought it was going to be the best show of the year but it’s definitely nowhere near as good as it could have been if it was longer and better paced. Being better animated and a little more exciting and memorable instead of making me rewatch it from the beginning once I finished it in order to write something about it definitely would have helped too.<br />
<br />
And now, a little breakdown of each aspect for a little more justified rating<br />
<br />
VISUALS - 4/10<br />
<br />
Well made backgrounds and effects but very bad artwork, character figures and motions.<br />
<br />
SOUND - 8/10<br />
<br />
Good music, very good sound effects and acceptable voice acting.<br />
<br />
STORY - 6/10<br />
<br />
Interesting and well presented conflict with proper pacing and logic in the first half but not so much in the second, with a pretty bad finale.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS - 7/10<br />
<br />
Proactive and well established cast of characters that stay relevant throughout most of its duration with very fleshed out and evolving protagonists, but some of them are completely forgotten by the end.<br />
<br />
VALUE - 3/10<br />
<br />
Mostly unknown and very forgettable title. Rewatching it definitely helps to notice some things that can go unnotice on a first watch but it’s something most people would not do for the show is frankly not exciting and on top of that it’s pretty badly animated.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT - 7/10<br />
<br />
What can I say? It was the only show from its season that I actually liked, especially during its first half, and I also liked it the same if not even more when I rewatched it a second time.<br />

    I don&#039;t like writing reviews (in fact this is the first one), but I felt compelled to write one for Magatsu Wahrheit when I saw the score for this anime not reflecting the amount of pull this anime has for me.  I believe it would be unfortunate if this anime was overlooked for just that reason.<br />
<br />
First, I really like the pace of the story, since for me, has kept me looking forward to the next episodes.  Plots and sub-plots are introduced steadily without the usual exhaustive exposition most animes rely on in the first couple of episodes.  They evolve at a steady

          <span style="display: none;" id="review365532">
        pace that expands the scope of the underlying conspiracy for the world/country of this anime.  <br />
<br />
The main character&#039;s predicament of being pulled into an organization, which is at odds with the government of this anime, sets a strong backdrop for the main character to grow.  Unlike the usual main character anime tropes, the character is fairly grounded in a way that you would meet a person in the real world, making it easy to imagine yourself in his shoes.  Despite the main character&#039;s cowardice and lack of conviction, he faces his predicaments in a relatable way that people would do in a non-stereotypical shonen jump character kind of way.  As the story goes on, I found the display of the main character&#039;s growth strengthen my appeal to him.<br />
<br />
The supporting characters are likeable as well and any adversaries that I have seen so far can be lent some sympathy.  One of the strengths of this anime is that there are some real consequences that befall some characters in the beginning, which makes the stakes of all the characters in the anime seem precarious.  <br />
<br />
The setting of this anime would be reminiscent of the world war one era, however it is fictionalized as some characters using melee weapons are able to deflect bullets, monsters are a thing, and there is magic.  That being said, the fantasy aspects of this anime are not excessive as there are no overpowered characters with saiyan or naruto-esque levels of speed or abilities.<br />
<br />
Overall the strength of this anime lies with its story, character development, and pace.  I hope this review makes you give this anime a chance. <br />
<br />
EDIT: Brought the overall score down one point because of the ending being so wanting.

    To put this out front, I just finished this series after mostly watching it week-to-week and it largely left me with a feeling of emptiness. The few reviews that I tend to write are pretty well planned out if nothing else, but this time around I&#039;m going to just write this as I go to use it as a way to work through my feelings on what I just watched. So, yeah.... To that end, I&#039;ll still keep my usual category breakout format and get right into it:<br />
<br />
-----Story - 3 out of 10-----<br />
Magatsu Wahrheit is an anime based on a mobile game which takes place

          <span style="display: none;" id="review371446">
        in magitech setting, fusing industrial age modern esthetics with classic sword and sorcery fantasy elements mixed in. The main plot centers on how a normal truck driver gets mixed up in a resistance organization while a bunch of political intrigue concerning a magical disease and experimentation goes on in the background. To its credit, I felt that the story structure of the series went really well at first! They drop you into an interesting situation without spoon feeding you a bunch of backstory. Things for the most part naturally come to light and seem pretty interesting. But then, the series just kind of loses focus. They&#039;re setting up a bunch of &quot;stuff&quot; and I&#039;m watching wondering if any of it is going to actually go anywhere. There are a few sparse bright spots, like a subplot that takes place with a small village in the forest that I thought was genuinely interesting and touching. But it mostly just meanders along until I absolutely lose all interest in the story. And then finally, they committed the dreadful sin of a grand exposition dump with took up the entire first half of episode 10, betraying the previous more natural storytelling structure. It was so frustratingly bad that I would have been pulling at my hair if it wasn&#039;t for the fact that I shave my head. Then the ending came.... Now, I don&#039;t really mind a non-conclusive ending, but the final &quot;and the story continues....&quot; crap that they pulled at the end of this left me wondering what the point was in all of this?? I mean, I assume the point was to advertise the mobile game, but still. Could they not have done better? It felt like this was originally supposed to be a 24 episode series, but it wasn&#039;t doing all that well so they decided to make it half as long. I don&#039;t know. Maybe I&#039;m missing something. Maybe this story will appeal to an audience that is more into political intrigue than I am, but man, I just thought the story was an utter mess.<br />
<br />
-----Art - 4 out of 10-----<br />
If I had to describe the art and animation of this series in one word, it&#039;d be &quot;inconsistent&quot;. Yes, having some inconsistencies in the production for a weekly TV anime is to be expected, especially when also dealing with COVID-19 leading up to and during its production. But this is some pretty bad stuff. First thing is the hilariously bad opening credits &quot;animation&quot;. The first few episodes had a temp-opening which was little more than a Windows 95 screensaver with some text over it. Then, they eventually got a &quot;finished&quot; OP together which was barely better, mostly consisting of the series&#039; central artifact floating around with silhouette action animation mostly consisting of scenes from the show itself. Oh, and then the ending credits didn&#039;t even bother with trying to do anything as it was just text scroll on a black screen. Anyway, so what about the look of the series proper? Well, there were some actual good points to this as the animation of the big action sequence in the first episode looked pretty cool! And the look of the series was unique and interesting enough overall; not your typical fantasy look for the most part so it can act as a bit of a breath of fresh air. But then, some of the character designs just look weird and there is a plethora of off-model faces that began to make me laugh constantly at one point. Again, I don&#039;t know how fair this criticism is when this kind of thing isn&#039;t particularly rare in anime, plus dealing with COVID could have been a factor, but man this largely sucked.<br />
<br />
-----Sound - 6 out of 10-----<br />
The highest score I&#039;m giving goes to Sound! And it&#039;s just an &quot;it&#039;s alright&quot; 6-score in the end. I felt that a good amount of the music was really nice. I was especially a fan of this one particular recurring little ditty that was in damn near every episode. And the voice acting overall wasn&#039;t bad, but wasn&#039;t particularly memorable either. Honestly, this might have gotten a better score if there was more music, but they did re-use a LOT of stuff. But hey, overall, not bad.<br />
<br />
-----Characters - 5 out of 10-----<br />
One of my biggest personal things in fiction is that I can still enjoy a series with a weak story as long as I have some nice characters to latch onto. Unfortunately, this is largely a plot-focused story so there is only so much that good characters can do. And sadly, when it comes to the characters in Magatsu Wahrheit, as a whole they were mediocre at best. I did find our lead Innumael to be enjoyable/interesting for the most part, although he did legitimately get annoying at times. Spunky little Irma was probably my second favorite character in the series, but she wasn&#039;t in it enough to make much of an impact. Aside from that, the characters didn&#039;t do much for me. I thought the series especially had a major villain problem. One of the best antagonists was a psychotics military commander, but he was pretty much just generic pure evil dude with little real motivation and once he was out of the picture there wasn&#039;t much to fill the void since all of the other bad stuff was being worked &quot;from the shadows&quot; or whatnot.<br />
<br />
-----Enjoyment - 4 out of 10-----<br />
So how was my personal enjoyment of this series? Well, that&#039;s kind of what I&#039;m trying to figure out. I ended up giving this series a personal score of a &quot;4&quot;, something that I don&#039;t do very often with my broad tastes and largely forgiving critiques of entertainment. But with how empty and pointless the whole experience of watching this felt, it definitely fit the &quot;Bad&quot; label that a &quot;4&quot; holds in the &quot;Your Score&quot; dropdown on MAL. While I was enjoying myself and interested in the series for the first few episodes, I then began to enjoy it less and less until it became a legitimate chore to sit through around the 8th episode. But at that point, I was in it for the long haul and just watching it once a week wasn&#039;t PURE torture or anything. But man, in the end I just couldn&#039;t grasp what the point of this all was. Innumael kind of seemed to have grown throughout the series, but also mostly felt the same. The main promo image used on Funimation&#039;s page for this series shows a 2-halves look at Innumael and Leocadio, one half of them as they look at the beginning of the series and the other showing more badass versions of them sometime in the future. But in the scope of the anime, these fully badass versions are never seen, with the only part that&#039;s truly realized being the cut across Leo&#039;s face. Again, it feels like this was originally meant to be a 24 episode series that got cut short, or you&#039;re just expected to move from this to the mobile game. Who knows. But whatever the reasoning is, I felt fully unsatisfied with this series in every way and it hurts all the more because of its earlier potential.<br />
<br />
-----Overall - 5 out of 10 (Conclusion)-----<br />
In the end, I&#039;m going to go ahead and bump my overall review score for this series up one point from my personal enjoyment score. I admit that a major reason for that is me being influenced by the fact that prior to me writing this review, the lowest review score given was a &quot;6&quot; and the literal majority of reviews posted are 9s or better. I MUST be missing something, right? Did I just &quot;not get&quot; this series? Again, I&#039;m generally rather kind with my critique of anime as I have pretty broad tastes. Usually, if I don&#039;t like something that others do, I can recognize it largely as a matter of personal taste. And granted, the average score for this series is not great (6.60 at the time of writing), so maybe it&#039;s mostly just people who enjoyed the series that are inspired enough to review it, while those who didn&#039;t like it simply didn&#039;t care enough to write a review? I don&#039;t know. I guess there might be something here to enjoy if magitech and political intrigue are things you&#039;re REALLY into. But for me, that just wasn&#039;t enough to counteract the inconsistent production, incomplete and uninteresting story, and overall meh characters. And with that, I guess this came out just about as extensive as most of my other reviews. Well, hope this was somehow helpful for someone to read! It was at least a nice way for me to gather my thoughts on this series.

    Having read all the 8&#039;s, 9&#039;s and such I was spurred into action by my sense of justice...and to let readers see a different opinion other than the fanatics of the series.<br />
<br />
Firstly if you looking for a good action filled anime, this ain&#039;t it. Sorry sunshine but this one is tons of dialogue and politics. But hey, believe it or not, that&#039;s not the worst part of this horrible adaptation. <br />
<br />
See, they need to leave these no name game adaptations where they belong, nowhere. But I digress, that&#039;s just a little rant of mine. <br />
<br />
Putting it bluntly so&#039;s that I don&#039;t bore you to death,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411835">
        the worst part of this anime is the characters, and not all the characters, just a the lead. And not BOTH leads, just the little pansy who suddenly becomes a hero. Because yeah, we haven&#039;t seen that character type before.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I can overlook the character designs, the generic facial animations and the text book personality traits as seen in this title. <br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s a huge skip unless you like cookie, then enjoy this baked treat courtesy of the a-typical cookie cutter that seems to be Japanese game animation adaptations. <br />
<br />

    Now, I know what you&#039;re thinking: a game adaption! When the hell are those ever good? They&#039;re soulless cash grabs shamelessly promoting a crappy mobile game that you never heard of. <br />
However! There are exceptions to this rule. I have discovered this show, along with Bahamut Genesis Season 1 (Let&#039;s not talk about season 2), both of which are great game adaptions, surprising us all. It sure surprised me. I&#039;ll be honest, I&#039;ve never heard of this game before, nor do I ever plan on playing it, but the anime is actually pretty good.<br />
Magatsu Wahrheit: Zuerst has a comically amazing setup and story for a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review380005">
        game adaption. In fact, it&#039;s probably one of the best story lines I&#039;ve seen in a while. Truly, the pacing and story arcs that chain into one another is extremely well done for a 12 episode series. It manages to weave in a complex mysterious political plot at hand in an empire. <br />
Innamuel, one of our main characters gets very naturally caught up in the development of this political plot, and he and the people he meet all are trying to figure out the big picture. <br />
What this show does is focus a lot on the story, and less on the characters. This is fine, if the story is well made, which it definitely is. The introductory arc that lets you understand Immanuel&#039;s situation and personality is pretty good, and the way they introduce the mysterious of the story and how it eventually makes everyone reach the conclusion is definitely one of the best I&#039;ve seen. Honestly, the plot is quite simple: it&#039;s just the way that the characters have to get this information and get out of bad situations that is hard. <br />
This story doesn&#039;t deal with episodic arcs. Every single episode is leading to the culmination conclusion, and you get to see visible progress in the investigation and plot at hand. It&#039;s delicately made, and brilliantly paced. No screen time is wasted, and every scene is important for either the plot, or necessary character development. It&#039;s bold, and it works. There&#039;s a lot of stuff that gets crammed into a 12 episode series, and the fact that this ambitious act actually works deserves my praise. The story just flows super naturally, it doesn&#039;t seem like there&#039;s any forced plot at hand, and there&#039;s not much plot armor. Of course, our main characters get out of sticky situations a few times, but it&#039;s in the realm of possibility, and it&#039;s not frequently done.<br />
Of course, the story is good, but what about characters? Honestly, for how little focus there is on character development for all but Immanuel and Leo, it&#039;s good. I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any tropes, and character design is quite good. There&#039;s a decent pool of characters that contribute to the story, but nothing too much, and as such, you don&#039;t see random people progressing the plot very frequently. Of course, there are arbitrary characters that are introduced to accelerate the plot, but for the most part, the characters that are involved in the story are there to stay, and the chemistry among those characters are good for how little time there is to invest in them. Immanuel is clearly the greatest character of the story: there&#039;s a lot of focus on characterizing and developing his personality and motivations. I think his adapting to the situation at hand and maturing is well done, but his motivations are kind of iffy. He does put his life on the line for people he barely knows. Leo&#039;s character is rarely explored, but he does have a maturing arc of his own, and it&#039;s not that bad. Basically, a bread and butter JP protagonist: loves fighting the weak and has a naïve sense of justice. The others are fine, just not too explored, but the story gives them enough personality for me to like them. <br />
Now, the worst part: the worldbuilding. It just doesn&#039;t exist. Theres actually NOTHING explained about the world. It seems like technology from the industrial revolution is constantly being used in the series, but architecture is straight from medieval Europe. Magic is used, but infrequently and the magic system is never explained. It seems like most poeple can&#039;t use magic, and it&#039;s not that strong compared to heavy artillery weapons. But then, there&#039;s magic that&#039;s used at the conclusion of the series that&#039;s absolutely OP. Again, no idea. Lots of things that I would liked to have been explained to me get glanced over, like the coldfire phenomenon or some other things, but honestly, it had to be done, since if there was any world building, the already crammed plot would overflow and the story would be rushed. I&#039;m glad that the story was given the attention that it needed for succcess.<br />
Art is decent, some backgrounds are nice, but fighting scenes are all but mediocre. At least CGI isn&#039;t really used, but overall, lackluster animation. <br />

    This anime is one of my most favorite this season. I gave 10 out of 10 on all 6 criteria cause this anime is something that would make your heart pump and be curious about the stories and not just about one particular character.<br />
<br />
The development of each character is outstanding and the story is something that I highly enjoy. <br />
<br />
As for the Art, this kind of animation is something that is new to my eyes, that is the first reason why I decided to watch it and when I started I just can&#039;t stop.<br />
<br />
The music is also something that is new for me, most anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review371337">
        these past years have been on the same genre, and hearing this different music is something that I truly enjoyed, it made me feel that &quot;AOT&quot; feeling I had when I heard the first OST. It&#039;s refreshing. And as a music enthusiast, music has a big factor for me when I am deciding when an anime is a Masterpiece or Great.<br />
<br />
I am hoping for a season 2, I haven&#039;t researched about the future plans for MWZ but I hope there is a season 2 cause this anime is gonna hunt me for the rest of my life if I didn&#039;t get a chance to know how their different journeys will collide and end.

    [This review is spoiler free!] TL;DR: I&#039;m pretty convinced that the people who gave this anime an 8/9 review believe that different means good. It doesn&#039;t. <br />
<br />
Like some other reviewers said, Magatsu Wahrheit: Zuerst doesn&#039;t have the typical romance, isekai, harem, comedy elements that are common in more fantasy shows nowadays. Maybe a part of the hype comes from Zuerst being an anime adaptation of the game of the same name, but for me, it just doesn&#039;t hit. <br />
<br />
None of the characters are particularly likable, the plot itself was predictable, and the fantasy elements like magic were pretty much on the backburner the entire time.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review413100">
        <br />
<br />
The best part of the show is the ending. I thought the last episode was good, but the time I spent getting to that point was definitely not worth it in my opinion. None of the characters ever really grew on me, and even now, as I write this review, I am still confused about the point of the show. <br />
<br />
I will give some credit where it&#039;s due though. The background art was absolutely stunning, but I wish the same could be said for the characters themselves. While the background was pretty, the character design was often inconsistent. The only comedy in the show came from the strange faces or inconsistencies of the art, otherwise, there wasn&#039;t much of anything there.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I can genuinely say that I&#039;m glad I&#039;m done watching Magatsu Wahrheit: Zuerst.

    I am baffled MWZ sits on 6.5. That means horrible for MAL standards. MWZ is far from horrible!<br />
<br />
MWZ started off bad. The first episode gets into action and showcased combat involving swords, guns and magic. Audience expected more explosion and special effects, they always do, but the mages just use their staves/rods as plasma guns and the actual gunners are just storm-trooping each other. Swordfights are okay. The first action sequence was not bad and involved a lot of combatants. Unfortunately, there were two weird cuts that gave off the impression that MWZ is one of those cheap promo anime for video games. <br />
First weird

          <span style="display: none;" id="review408939">
        cut is when a melee soldier attacked the viewers and slashed a few times, then he just stops for a second to stare into your soul, then nothing ensues. <br />
Second weird cut is when Conrad holds a handgun almost as long as a rifle then shoots a few times, screen cuts to Schaake just chilling beside the car, then she takes a few steps to the left quietly, only to stand and shoot back. I think they forgot to add gun impacts to show that Schaake is dodging Conrad&#039;s bullets. <br />
These two mishaps only happened in the first episode, which is a crucial episode to impress viewers, and perhaps because of those mishaps, a lot of them were turned away. <br />
It is a shame. There are three or more fight scenes after that, and they did not have the same blunder as the first. MWZ&#039;s action sequence feels grounded as it involves all of the combatants. None of these characters are overpowered and exceptionally good at fighting. They always struggle in fights, giving a sense of dread. The BGM also builds up tension perfectly without too much volume. <br />
<br />
Next is character. Good balanced characters. We start off with two main characters, Leocadio the handsome boy with the cool hairstyle, and Innumael the wimpy boy with that yee-yee ass haircut. Guess who gets more screen time? Our real main character is Innumael because his side of the story has more freedom and action. Due to Innumael&#039;s wimpy character, he doesn&#039;t lead the show. He is just caught in the motions and going along with it. Still, Innumael is quite the talkative person and interacts with the side characters, bringing out more of their voices and personalities. Eventually, Innumael grew on me and the other characters. <br />
Leocadio&#039;s early role is the cliche military rookie learning the darkness of military, so he was restricted and didn&#039;t get much spotlight until later episodes. <br />
MWZ manages to introduce a huge amount of characters yet able to make them all memorable and significant. That is a remarkable feat. <br />
<br />
Last on the list is art and sound. <br />
Art is so-so, not much to say. Various settings is traveled in this anime so the background art doesn&#039;t getting boring, but it is still oversimplified. Animation is okay. The action sequences are not that flashy. Art melts sometimes. <br />
Sound is hard to judge. I&#039;m pretty sure the anime has a huge variety of soundtracks for almost every kind of atmosphere, but they&#039;re all too low volume and too ambient to be memorable. The BGM during fight scenes are good. Sound effects are okay and reasonably loud in fights. Voice acting is well done, a lot of veteran voice actors. <br />
<br />
Ah, what a commercial failure. MWZ might garner more fans if they just sexualize the soul out of Schaake to bait sad virgins like me. There was a scene where Schaake was nailed down by Seitz and the camera angled perfectly to show more boobs, yet her boobs wasn&#039;t really drawn that erotically and it ended quickly. To make it worse, because Innumael has that yee-yee ass haircut, he can&#039;t get bitches on his dick. So romance route with Schaake is closed. Fanservice is dead.<br />
It would also be cool if the combatants can do some sort of breathing style and have glowing special effects around them, then make mages shoot epileptic seizures.  <br />
Also, what&#039;s with the OP? Fucking birdy opera like it&#039;s the Food Chain episode of Adventure Times. C&#039;mon man we wanna listen to LiSA singing the same song over and over again! ED is lit though.<br />
MWZ&#039;s attempt on being a serious show without all those shameless anime tropes is applaudable and entertaining, but it lead to its failure. It is a shame. A true shame. <br />
<br />
I forgot to talk about the story. The story is excellent, no spoiler? Just Episode 10 spouts a bit too much information to take in. There&#039;s no comedy btw. MWZ is a dull ride. The characters are all sad and serious most of the time(except Irma) and although Innumael jokes around occasionally, he isn&#039;t that funny. Comedy has been misused in dark anime as a tool to lighten up the mood and keep the audience going. Even Berserk has comedy and nude ladies to keep readers excited. <br />
MWZ for whatever reason... refused to sell hot anime girls, refused to do flashy action, refused to hire LiSA to sing another Gurenge and refused to do comedy. <br />
Now I am not so baffled anymore. MWZ sits rightfully on 6.5 because anime is a mistake.

    I don&#039;t get why all the top reviews are of 9 or 10. The time I&#039;m writing this review the rating of this show is 6.67 which literally means that only those who like it are writing the reviews and others don&#039;t care at all what happens.<br />
<br />
It was clearly a political drama with a fool sitting at top of the chain.<br />
Also this is the first anime I have seen where a supporting character who doesn&#039;t even appear in many scenes gives an aura of main character.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Nothing in the story gave any sort of satisfaction as such. The summary of this show made this show a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401922">
        great catch at beginning, but it was just a show off. I literally was in a bind trying to understand what actually the show is trying to tell?<br />
beginning was hap hazard and ending was obnoxious. <br />
<br />
Only a single mystery needs explanation and I don&#039;t really am interested in that mystery anymore.

    This show is like a deviantArt entry that is well colored in, all the darks and lights are in, but anyone trained to draw or to evaluate art can see that the anatomy and line art is sloppy and the colors compliment each other poorly.<br />
<br />
On one hand at least this isn&#039;t an isekai...<br />
<br />
On this other, this show suffers from many problems...<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
The occasional low budget character drawing but not that bad its solid. Mostly its the backgrounds that are good though.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
They tried. It&#039;s nothing catchy but nothing earsplitting.<br />
<br />
Character: 6<br />
This is where they have kind of bit off more than they can chew. There is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review371798">
        a relatively large cast for a 12  episode series. Most of the characters I can&#039;t remember their names after seeing them. There are supposed to be two main characters mainly, but one  of them is effectively a cardboard and the other one is just a coward. Of the 2 (3) main characters, between 1D to 4D, they are about 3D-3.5D. Side characters are like, 2D-2.5D. They are there as just a drawing that moves, does things, but it barely has a personality. Overall, this area is barely passable. I do understand it is 12 episodes.<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
While the characterization is largely inept, this bit had potential. Especially after all the setting and conspiracies are revealed, this really could have been done better.<br />
<br />
First off, we have a generic Deutsch-because-it-sounds-cool empire. Okay... but could we elaborate more on this? What&#039;s the culture like? aside from copying pre-WW2 Prussia and adding magic.<br />
<br />
Next, we have the ethics spoilers that got revealed mid series. This was a great chance to explore a philosophical/ethical theme... but... no. Just... bland game plot of good guy, bad guy, and big government plot. Best part is, this was left hanging.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6<br />
I wanted to enjoy this...but... every time I thought something good was going to happen, something else happens to make me cringe instead...<br />
<br />
Overall: 6 (I&#039;m being somewhat generous here)<br />
