    If you are into shows that cover alternate dimensions, time travel and pretty much traveling between dimensions then this might just be the one you&#039;ve been looking for. It gives a lot vibes from Steins Gate, one of my all time favorites and it honestly kept me desiring for more until the final arc. <br />
<br />
The final arc is notorious. It is awfully obvious that they simply just ran out of episodes as things will seem and feel very rushed story development wise. The first few episodes of the final arc will definitely blow you away by the new things it will add to the overall

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318857">
        plot. The execution is just so poor. It is honestly saddening. And the ending is an even bigger let down. <br />
<br />
That aside, everything up until the last arc is simply amazing. If it weren&#039;t for the final arc I would&#039;ve rated this show a lot higher on average. The characters are still quite dull though. Some great characters get randomly killed off, others get introduced and never get any screen time afterwards. Others are just there to make the MC seem like a wise person. The characters themselves barely hold any presence which doesn&#039;t make them outstanding or memorable. Plenty of them were just made extremely unintelligent especially in specific situations where many solutions were present. But we need to see a shining MC. I don&#039;t like that kind of thing in shows. <br />
<br />
I did like the art style it was clean and neat. Not only that some of the animations were great. The twist at the final arc makes it even better animation wise. They definitely had quality and a budget.. just wish they had more episodes for a proper ending...<br />
<br />
Sound effects were from good quality, maybe even great. Despite the dull characters the VA&#039;s did a good job delivering emotions. <br />
<br />
Finally the story. The whole story is actually amazing. I dig time travel and alternate dimensions and this show covers those 2 topics in a very interesting way. Even with the final arc all questions got answered, even if it was in a rushed manner, the story was complete. There certainly were annoying moments and moments that I do have my doubts/concerns about but all in all it was quite enjoyable. <br />
<br />
The final arc will be a major let down but the other arcs are so impressive that it still scores an average of 7. If the final arc was of the same quality I would rate it a 9 with only the characters being the thing weighting the overall show down. <br />
<br />
Do note that my opinion isn&#039;t factual. You can disagree with me and you are free to do so.

    Watching YU-NO is like researching a piece of anime history disguised as a piece of entertainment media. It&#039;s something that really would have been far more impactful had it aired 20 years ago than it is today, but nevertheless it&#039;s interesting to watch for educational purposes perhaps more so than the story itself.<br />
<br />
In essence, YU-NO is based on a classic visual novel from all the way back in 1996. At the time of its release, there wasn&#039;t really anything else like it on the market. Visual novels back then were still relatively unambitious and it wasn&#039;t really a medium attempting any grand storylines until YU-NO

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318833">
        came along. I guess you can say that YU-NO was for the visual novel medium what something like Evangelion was to anime for its time. Something that paved the way for so many other works in the decades thereafter. But in the same way that Evangelion is not normally considered anything revolutionary for people that watch it for the first time today, the same problem can be seen here as watching the anime adaptation of YU-NO 23 years after its original VN release will make it a lot more difficult seeing what the big deal is supposed to be.<br />
<br />
It is however quite clear that a lot of famous anime have taken ideas and inspiration from YU-NO originally. Steins;Gate might be the most obvious parallel there seeing as its time leap machine is clearly based on YU-NO&#039;s reflection device, and its world line and attractor field concepts are pretty much directly taken from it as well. You can kind of think of YU-NO as the grandfather of all sci-fi and time travel-oriented visual novel stories, which has surely also spilled over into other mediums in Japan over the years considering that the game has always been amongst the top rated VNs in the country because of its legacy.<br />
<br />
That said, the actual anime itself isn&#039;t really that special by today&#039;s standards. It goes through the various routes one at a time in a way which is not particularly unusual for VN adaptations but it comes with the regular problem of whichever heroine who&#039;s route it&#039;s not currently on seemingly disappearing from the story all of a sudden which feels quite unnatural. The characters themselves are also fairly bland, and you&#039;re often left with the feeling that a bunch of content has probably been cut out from the original since the pacing can be quite jumpy. As a result it can sometimes get confusing and it&#039;s a bit difficult to really settle down with it. Eventually things does start to make more sense about what is going on in the grander scheme of things but it takes quite a long time to get there, and once it gets to the final arc things will have changed so much it feels like you&#039;re watching a completely different anime than you did at the beginning. A better anime admittedly, but nevertheless the continuity of it all feels a bit strange as a result. On the other hand, the plot reveals towards the end are quite shocking in a lot of ways, and I mean that in a positive sense. It somehow managed to tie all the loose plot threads together in a much more complex manner of fashion than one would anticipate.<br />
<br />
Overall though it&#039;s a bit difficult knowing whether to recommend YU-NO or not because the main reasons for watching it are not really related to the anime itself but rather just because of the source material&#039;s legacy and impact on the industry in the past two decades. It&#039;s something more worth watching to satisfy your curiosity and to learn something in the process rather than for what entertainment value it possesses by itself.<br />
<br />
But as a side note I can in that case also mention that the 1080p remake of the visual novel is being officially released on PC in Japan and on multiple platforms in English on October 1st 2019. In other words, literally the same day as this anime ended. I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s not a coincidence so we can definitely assume the main purpose of this adaptation was to boost sales and interests of the VN&#039;s remake, and I think I might as well just go ahead and oblige to that because if you haven&#039;t seen YU-NO yet and you&#039;ve been thinking of whether you should do it or not... your best bet is most likely to just go ahead and pick up the just released VN remake instead. I&#039;m probably going to do the same one of these days.

    Throughout my years of anime watching, there’s something I’ve learned about game adaptations. That is, most of them fail to live up to hype and become a poor man’s version of its original game. This applies to games including the visual novel genre especially with remakes from decades ago. Watching Kono Yo no Hate de Koi wo Utau Shoujo confirms my suspicions and reminds myself to always lower expectations when coming into an anime adaptation based off of a video game.<br />
<br />
With 26 episodes, you’d think the anime itself hits the sweet spot for its pacing. From what I’ve heard, the original game consists over 50

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318832">
        hours of gameplay with the main story covering at least 30 hours. When the anime adaptation got announced, I recall hearing plans about the series will “cover all the characters and routes from the original game”. Other comments they made includes making the character Mio “more tsundere” and that anime would “outdo the game’s dirty jokes”. Coming into this show as an anime viewer, these were on my low priority list. I didn’t choose to dive into this show looking for a tsundere character or dirty jokes. That’s what Hensuki is for.<br />
<br />
But on my first viewing, I do admit the show itself carries a degree of mystery with is premise. The first episode actually managed to grab my attention despite the over usage of time travel tropes in the anime industry. Takuya comes into the show with a personality that blends the line between confident and cocky. When the staff mentioned about dirty jokes, they weren’t kidding about inserting them into dialogues and various conversations. Whenever Takuya interacts with the opposite sex, it seems he can’t hold back on making at least one perverted joke. This applies to characters such as Mio, Mitsuki, Kaori, Eriko, and to a lesser extent, Kanna. As the main character, he gets involved into a variety of mysteries that sparks some potential. From the first episode, he receives a package of mysterious objects and also encounters a mysterious blonde girl. After receiving a kiss, she disappears. From here, Takuya is thrown into a wave of conspiracies and his life changes forever. The mysterious object he receives plays an integral part of the plot that does extend well beyond the realm of time travel. It would also appear that the device has connections to his father’s legacy. Looking back now, I had to remind myself that this isn’t developer Mages’ only work dealing with time travel. The popular Steins;Gate franchise also used such ideas that made a thrilling sensation. For YU-NO, it’s not a show I want to compare to but both anime does contain time travel and parallel worlds. In fact, the first main story arc deals with Takuya using his device to time travel and making changes to the past to influence the present. Sound similar? However, the first anime arc did generate a thrilling sensation as we watch Takuya’s every move. Even with his personality, you have to admit Takuya has a lot of guts and isn’t afraid of taking risks. Remember, he is traveling through parallel worlds to fix mistakes and trying to unravel the mysteries of his father’s legacy. It’s the type of responsibility he bears on his shoulders that shouldn’t be taken lightly.<br />
<br />
When watching YU-NO, I had to also remind myself that anything can happen in this show. Takuya is a daring protagonist who resolves to take risks that puts his own life into jeopardy if it means learning the truth. From his actions in the first half of the series, I did appreciate a protagonist who can keep me at the edge of my seat. Unfortunately, it’s the many character interactions he has with others that puts me off. From the half-baked sex jokes and lubricious dialogues, it’s actually had to take the guy seriously. This is especially true during Mio’s route/arc where I lost count the number of “dirty jokes” that were made. However, I don’t want to judge Takuya too much as the main lead. The show has its own female character roster too.<br />
<br />
With each route focusing on a different plot (although connecting the overall core story), this anime had to at least make some of its female characters intriguing. I have to regret to say that outside of Eriko, there’s really no character that I declare as likable. For instance, both Ayumi and Kaori are adults who gets involved into complicated affairs. These two characters are added into the main arc for seemingly inspiring more drama for the sake of drama. On the other hand, mysterious characters such as Kanna makes little impact for the show altogether. I can’t recall one moment in this show where I can look back and say “oh, that was clever!” And of course, who can forget about Mio? The wealthy tsundere is a main target for Takuya’s butt jokes that makes a fool out of her character. The only female character I can tolerate is Eriko who has a more mature personality and actual brain with her school nurse outfit. Nonetheless, the first half of the anime will make or break the show if decide to accept these characters and Takuya’s role as the protagonist.<br />
<br />
Then, the second half happened. We’re in 2019, an age where isekai is a popular trend and every season has a few of them. Guess what? Kono Yo no Hate de Koi wo Utau Shoujo isn’t going to let this chance slip away either.<br />
<br />
Honestly, watching the second half of Kono Yo no Hate de Koi wo Utau Shoujo felt like watching a different show altogether. It almost feels like entering the Twilight Zone where logic is tossed out the window. With a brand new world and RPG-like setting, we follow Takuya’s adventures in this fantasy setting. Oh and remember the girl that kissed Takuya from the first episode? She’s back and takes on a more important role. Now, we are also introduced to other characters such as Amanda, Illia, and others who takes on the adventure trope. I probably had to pitch myself and asked if this was real. Make no mistake, I was actually quite thrown off by the certain change of the plot direction. The first half of the show contained mysteries that while not being well written did carry a thrilling sensation. But now, we got an otherworldly isekai adventure that isn’t any unique to what we’ve seen in recent years of the genre. To me, that’s a fair statement to make since from episode 19 and forward, this appears to me as what most isekai in modern era are. Using the fantasy setting, we have guilds, weapons, magic, and all the old tricks from the book. The only plausible part of the second half I commend is the more emotional content. With radical changes of the setting and story, it sometimes makes an impact and capitalize on its new plot. That being said, you should probably hold back and determine for yourself if it’s worth getting that far into this anime.<br />
<br />
Studio feel obviously had an intention to make this show appealing to a modern audience. Compared to the game graphics of the late 1990s, the anime has a more modern standard unlike its old school generation. Of course, the franchise is known for its sexual content and the anime does contain some controversial content. It does omit what’s needed to be shown on television but the series still contains moments of sexual assault and some nudity. Fan service is not too explicit but definitely appear often thanks to Takuya and the tone of the plot. The character designs ranges from school girls to more mature adults with character expressions matching in tone with their various personalities. Finally, I will say that Mages does deserve some credit for making the anime production flow consistently. The anime adaptation was announced nearly 2 years ago and planning this was not an easy task. They obviously wanted to have the animation quality look polished in the end and that’s what we do get.<br />

After 26 consecutive weeks of Kono Yo no Hate de Koi wo Utau Shoujo, I admit that the show made a bold attempt to showcasing the science fiction genre. Using the concept of sci-fi with time travel, isekai, and parallel worlds is no easy accomplishment. Mind you, this is a remake of the original series and I imagine the director wanted us to experience something refreshing. However, the show failed to capitalize on its creative ideas and instead gave us a mediocre story and lackluster cast. No thanks.

    I&#039;m an admittedly biased reviewer of this story considering I&#039;ve read the original YU-NO visual novel from 1996. However, I don&#039;t believe this disqualifies me from giving an accurate review of the anime.<br />
<br />
YU-NO is unique in that as the &#039;grandfather of the modern visual novel&#039;, its story is much of a prototype of some of the most popular time-travel/sci-fi stories today. It has influenced numerous highly regarded works such as Steins;Gate, Island, and even Clannad. This review, however, is about how I personally feel about the story of YU-NO being told in this anime adaption and why.<br />
<br />
Story (6/10)<br />
This story starts out as a slow burner,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318836">
        which does pay off later when the development somewhat is on point. The positive parts of the story are the many shots of foreshadowing - dropping hints on things that could become very important pieces of the puzzle as we progress further into the story. Through the first arc, we see hints and glimpses towards what the protagonist is getting himself into and what he&#039;ll be trying to achieve. We are given parts and fragments throughout the beginning few arcs that seemingly are unrelated but ultimately tie together later on. The first arc I feel was a great way of introducing the characters, the setting, and a general idea of the mysteries. Through discovering the suffering and pain Takuya&#039;s stemother Ayumi has been through, Takuya is able to not only help her resist the urge to succumb from the pain, but grow closer to her and by doing so, stumble upon information regarding GeoTechnics, their research, his father&#039;s life, what his father&#039;s goal may have been, and above all, how and why his father has given him a device that he can use to travel in the past to different worldlines.<br />
<br />
The story itself isn&#039;t one for the faint-hearted. It&#039;s dark, brutally realistic, and deals with mature concepts and themes in a respectful manner that most other anime tend to completely avoid. The foreshadowing pays dividends, as many of the things that have seemed confusing in previous episodes now make sense in context with information that is later revealed.<br />
<br />
If I had to describe the story with one word, it would be &quot;complex&quot;. The two &quot;halves&quot; of the story are very isolated from one another, yet at the end combine back together into one to make a complete package.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the script-writing really falls flat with the atmosphere and tone. Scenes that were truly haunting and bone chilling, filling you with a sense of dread in the visual novel, have lost much of their impact and it really shows because many of the big plot reveals are &quot;so what, why should we care?&quot; moments, and it sucks because the story is so much better than how it was adapted. Furthermore, some of the changes to the plot resulted in some very glaring plot-holes that didn&#039;t exist in the original story, and were never actually addressed leaving you wondering what the script-writers were thinking.<br />
<br />
What frustrated me the most is how senselessly some of the scenes were adapted. It&#039;s almost as if they completely changed the tone, trying to add comedy when really they overdid it and it came off as stupid and tone-deaf. The comedy when done well was fine, they just inserted it too much into some of the more serious scenes, which wasn&#039;t a problem in the visual novel because it was more &quot;dry humor&quot; than &quot;idiotic humor&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, for YU-NO to be properly adapted, it would have required most likely a) a different studio and b) more episodes in order to truly flesh out the plot and give impact to the many thrilling scenes that were in the visual novel.<br />
<br />
In the end, the changing of the plot to fit anime format wasn&#039;t done terribly, and this is one of the better adapted visual novel stories I&#039;ve seen. It simply falls flat in areas that, if had been done with much thought and expertise, could have really elevated the plot to the level that it was in the visual novel. The script-writing dropped the ball, honestly. It&#039;s a shame because a 10/10 story and plot was reduced to at best a 6/10.<br />
<br />
Characters (7/10)<br />
If there&#039;s one pretty positive part of YU-NO, in my opinion it would be the diverse character cast. Unlike most anime with a high school protagonist and a cast of all high schoolers, YU-NO actually surrounds the protagonist with more adult characters than high school-aged characters. Because the characters surrounding Takuya are professionals with real-world life experience, this gives more credibility to scenarios where Takuya finds himself in danger or encounters obstacles a high schooler usually wouldn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
Takuya himself is quite possibly the furthest thing from a self-insert protagonist that you could encounter in anime. His personality is defined: nonchalant, almost in a way that makes him seem like a huge jerk, as he&#039;s constantly making wisecracks to the dismay of others. It might seem as though he doesn&#039;t care about the people in his life with his flippant remarks and the way he&#039;s constantly having people do things for him (mainly Yuuki), but his carefree attitude in a way is almost an advantage for him because when he gets serious, people almost immediately notice it and take him seriously. Also, by acting like a complete buffoon, he&#039;s also able to play off some more inquisitive questions as a joke without others suspecting that he&#039;s trying to search for answers.<br />
<br />
All of the other characters are well-built and each have their own motives for their actions. The one drawback, however, is that the characters are mainly used as plot devices to advance the story - Takuya learns valuable pieces of information about the world and mysteries surrounding him through interacting with each character during their individual arcs, and the arcs focus on the story more than developing the characters, which causes some of them to fall flat.<br />
<br />
And because the story moves so fast, there&#039;s barely enough time to develop much attachment at all to the wide cast, leaving you to wonder why you should even care about them at all, and making them feel disposable. The sadder character moments in the visual novel actually had impact because the characters were more fleshed-out and the plot wasn&#039;t advancing at break-neck speed. Here, however, again, the sadder moments just felt gruesome and unnecessary and had little to no impact.<br />
<br />
Sound (4/10)<br />
Ohhhh boy, here we go. The first few episodes were very dry and barren of music, negatively impacting my experience of the story. Even when the sountrack expanded later throughout the show, it was repetitive and lacking. I expected way more from Evan Call, the composer of the Violet Evergarden OST. <br />
<br />
The OST from the visual novel is one of my most favorite OSTs ever. They used exactly THREE TRACKS from it, and instead opted for an anime-original soundtrack for the rest. That really upset me. Even without comparing the anime OST to the VN OST, the anime OST clearly is not good enough.<br />
<br />
Music is a valuable tool for emotional impact, and the OST in my opinion didn&#039;t cut it at all whatsoever.<br />
<br />
The voice acting is absolutely fantastic. Specifically Kaori Nazuka, as Ayumi Arima, has portrayed incredible emotion and is acting with a lot of passiont. Nothing bad to say about the rest of the cast. Maaya Uchida is great as always and Rie Kugimiya, the tsundere queen, has returned - albeit not with many appearances, but she&#039;s back nonetheless! In the second half of the series with characters that I won&#039;t mention, the voice acting was truly incredible. Very passionately done all across the board.<br />
<br />
The sound effects...have had some wonky moments. I&#039;ll leave it at that.<br />
<br />
OP/EDs are all fantastic. Konomi Suzuki in particular has done an incredible job with the ED1 and OP2. The second ending is probably my favorite of the four themes!<br />
<br />
Art (5/10)<br />
The art itself is a 7/10. Love the detailed backgrounds and general drawings. The character model changes weren&#039;t that great because they&#039;re much more generic than they were before, removing the &quot;gritty&quot; feeling that they once had. The animation, however, is a 3/10. This adaptation is basically a slideshow, the animation is that non-existent. The story deserved so much better.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (7/10)<br />
For a fan of the original visual novel, I can say that while this adaptation dropped the ball, it was at least an enjoyable watch. I would recommend it to people who like mysteries with a lot of plot twists, but not to anyone that wants an entirely coherent story. Although it is not a true 1:1 adaptation, changing and reordering quite a bit of scenes, the way they adapted the story - showcasing all the important information - only cut out some unnecessary scenes.<br />
<br />
<br />
This wasn&#039;t what I was hoping for out of this adaptation, but it was average! If you want the optimal experience, I do highly recommend reading either the original PC-98 port or the remake that&#039;s been released on Steam. The story will actually blow your mind.<br />

    Honestly,<br />
<br />
From what I have seen so far i&#039;m very disappointed. I have had a very hard time getting myself invested into the plot. I find myself going on my phone in the middle of the episode or just plain watching something else. I think later in the series it could get better though, because it has been a little bit more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
If I had to look at characters, as you would guess, my favorite would be Kanna. She has this mysterious presence that makes you wonder who she really is. The foreshadowing they use on her is a really great character development tool. We know

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310432">
        that she is involved but we don&#039;t know how much. She adds a really nice touch to the series.<br />
<br />
Welp. What else cam I say because this series is just bland. Characters are a generic looking style. They force the erotica style of the shows past a little too much (If you know, you know). If it wasn&#039;t for the intriguing plot I probably would have dropped it by now.<br />
<br />
This probably wasn&#039;t helpful but that&#039;s all I have to say for now. For all I know the series could completely turn around. When it does, I will update this crappy review.

    Seems like I have found the underdog anime of the season. <br />
<br />
&lt;SHORT VER&gt;<br />
Pros:<br />
1. Interesting premise<br />
2. Amazing OP and ED tracks<br />
3. Good art and animation<br />
4. VA is spot on<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
1. Story is kinda confusing, may need a rewatch or two to understand it<br />
2. Characters are pretty bland, most of them are stereotypes<br />
3. They didn&#039;t fully use the amazing OST from the game<br />
<br />
&lt;LONG VER&gt;<br />
<br />
Well, I have heard about this VN before the anime started airing. Seems like the VN inspired a lot of modern sci-fi masterpieces to be made such as Steins Gate and Island. The original VN came out in 1995 so you definitely can&#039;t say that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309041">
        the story is cliche considering that this is what started the trend. If you enjoy this anime and wanted to read the VN, you can either read the PC 98 version or wait until October for the official English release. Do note that the Eng release is going to be all ages and if you want those sweet smexy scenes you would have to read the PC 98 ver or just watch the R18 anime that came out in the early 2000s.<br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s dive into the anime and discuss if the series is worth a watch or not. Well, for me I like it. I like the interesting premise and definitely is eager to know more about it. Maybe at the current point the anime is still confusing but I will only place my final judgement until the anime finished airing. This is the kind of story that you&#039;ll find it hard to understand in a get go because of how complicated and rushed it was, so you&#039;ll have to rewatch it to fully grasp what&#039;s happening or just go read the VN as the anime wanted you to. Most VN adaptations nowadays are pretty much just advertisements for the game itself, so if I still couldn&#039;t understand what the anime is about then I will just continue on reading the VN. Easy. But at the current point I still enjoy watching the series so I won&#039;t give it a bad score, plus I heard that the anime is still staying pretty faithful to the VN from fellow VN readers. <br />
<br />
Now the overall quality of the anime...nothing amazing actually. For me everything is just normally drawn, nothing to praise about. I can see Feel not putting too much budget on this series. However I do like the character designs compared to the 95 ver, maybe is because I prefer this kind of art style as opposed to a lot of VN fans. <br />
<br />
For the sound department, the OP and ED are both awesome! One is sung by Asaka, the singer behind the ED for Occultic Nine and Island and another is sung by Suzuki Konomi, the singer behind the OP for NGNL and Re: Zero, so of course they are going to be awesome, plus the OP is composed by Chiyomaru Shikura, the creator of Steins;Gate, just straight up beautiful. However, the BGM is a letdown. I listened to the soundtracks of the game and it was on another level compared to the anime. Although the anime did use it sometimes, but still most of the time is just boring soundtracks you hear in every anime.<br />
<br />
The characters in this show is quite stereotypical, nothing that really stood out. Now we only know the background story for Ayumi but that&#039;s not interesting enough. Hope the background stories for other characters would surprise me somehow. However, as opposed to other VN readers, I prefer the character designs of the anime than the one in the PC98 game. <br />
<br />
All in all, I still do enjoy myself watching this anime despite all its flaws and I am definitely eager for more. I do plan on reading the translated ver when it comes out in October so yeah, do I recommend this? Yes. But do I think it&#039;s as good as a lot said it to be? Frankly no. Maybe the game is awesome but the anime adaptation is just average at best. Thanks for reading and I&#039;ll see you in my next review.

    in all of the episodes that I&#039;ve seen so far i had a mix feelings in whether i should keep watching this or just forget about it .<br />
<br />
the Anime has a great concept that i&#039;m sure of from watching these 6 Episodes so far it just the Execution is very low regarding certain elements in the main script .<br />
<br />
i kept seeing myself between stop caring for where this is going to kind of interested for where this will lead like i said above i had a mixed opinions about it .<br />
<br />
the story aside from the original concept isn&#039;t something special really like it is in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308015">
        my opinion isn&#039;t something i haven&#039;t seen before but it is like more of the same to me but it does have interesting events that actually might keep you wondering so there&#039;s that .<br />
<br />
the animation and the artwork here is standard here nothing to complain about it and nothing wow about it too .<br />
<br />
overall it can be a good thing to watch over the weekends and if you like Sci-Fi Animes then this might interest you .<br />
<br />
i give it a 5 / 10 rating from what I&#039;ve seen so far .<br />
<br />
<br />

    Well well, we got a surprise here. This show had a decent beginning with a weak follow up... but after a couple of episode it improved against all odds, I almost dropped it.<br />
<br />
So first, if you like mystery shows or time travel stuff with some weird theories then you should enjoy this. Despite the pretty generic beginning with predictable outcomes during the first episodes, the show started to surprise with things that you woudn&#039;t expect and I really enjoyed that. Sooo, the plot is interesting if you like the stuff I mentioned.<br />
<br />
The characters were also better than I expected, especially the MC, he has a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309405">
        pretty believable personality and he is more complex than the average... by quite a bit. Some of the side characters are interesting too and they aren&#039;t that easy to read.<br />
<br />
Now animation, it&#039;s good enough for this kind of story I guess, but it has some funny moments.<br />
<br />
Art, ok... just that, not much complain nor praise.<br />
<br />
Music, forgettable af.<br />
<br />
I also enjoyed the dialogs, it really helped to develop the characters and move the plot in ways that you don&#039;t expect.<br />
<br />
So, if you like some of the stuff I mentioned about the plot, characters with a bit of complexity or interesting dialogs you shoud give it a shot. And just in case, depending on your taste the real shit starts around 4 - 6 so I recommend watching at least until there, and it even gets better after that.

    Kono Yo no Hate de Koi wo Utau Shoujo YU-NO, which I will actually rename « Kono Yuno » was a really good show mixing very different genre such as supernatural, sci-fi, school or even drama.<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t be spoiling the main plot since it represents the core of what makes the anime interesting. The story itself looks easy &amp; simple to understand if you read the synopsys or take a quick look at one of the previews. However, I have honestly rarely seen such a complex and surprising story in a show. Indeed, each mysterious part gets resolved progressively but then, you discover than it delivered 2

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318866">
        new mysterious roots which are themselves going to be resolved later. As the main thematics of Kono Yuno, here are the words that came in my head first : temporal distorsion, temporal travel, parallel worlds, temporal cycle, dimensions, dimensional travel, etc.<br />
<br />
You probably understood it : Kono Yuno treats some very serious thematics that require a certain concentration to clearly get. It does not turn into a very complicated show, meaning there won&#039;t be such an enormous plot twist that&#039;ll blow your mind. Nevertheless, you will be surprised or even astonished as things advanced episode after episode. In fact, the original work came as a video game about 20 years ago and receives a remake tomorrow, the 2nd October 2019 (I will definitely look forward since it is sold on Steam ! ). This information has its importance because it signifies that the rythm was originally meant to be either quick if you played the game in a single run, or either long if you decided to take your time. The anime version respects the second rythm and makes sure you don&#039;t get lost each week after each week, which remains a great thing. Still, I must warn you that it can be very complicated on some points.<br />
<br />
About the other positives points besides the rich story : most characters are enjoyable. Actually the main one Takuya isn&#039;t as dumb as he may look like. However, there is something a lot of viewers disliked and this is the presence of ecchi scenes. To summarize this point, you have to know that Arima Takuya, the protagonist, is a high-school teenager and has a certain talent to say some perverted jokes or to make some nice suggestions. I don&#039;t find these points vulgar or too numerous and instead of adding some sort of fanservice, I&#039;d rather think they tend to provide a realistic character. Although, except for 1-2 characters who are very special, all the other ones remain normal and could cross your path in real life : there&#039;s no overpowered or powerful character except for the antagonist but this is part of the story.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t really have many remaining words for a non-spoiling review. Just know that if you look for a rich story with many surprises and mini twists, you are welcome to try it. I just loved it and it totally got my attention after a few episodes. I don&#039;t think I grew deceived by any episode, to be honest. And know that episode 1 and episode 26 are connected, but don&#039;t even think you would fully understand why by watching only these 2 (it would be such a waste actually).<br />
<br />

    There are the bones of an interesting tale here, and when the show focuses on the story elements, it&#039;s at it&#039;s best, but there are some identity and pacing issues. There are also often unnecessary fan service that break the tone of this show quite a bit. Everything else about it is completely average. <br />
<br />
So the tale surrounds a high school boy who inherits an ancient device that allows him to manipulate time and travel across dimensions. Imagine kind of Stein&#039;s Gate plus isekai elements. If that sounds interesting, it really is. Unfortunately there is a bit of a pacing issue, which admittedly, is pretty

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308177">
        common in early episodes of visual novel adaptations. There is a chance this can be rectified as the show progresses. That is if this show can pick an identity and stick with it. Is it a sci-fi time travel tale, or a mystery, or a fantasy show, or an ecchi? When a show tries to be too many things, it ends up doing none of them well. <br />
<br />
When art and sound are done well, it can draw the viewer in with ease. When art and sound are done poorly, it can push the viewer away.  When art and sound are done just fine, then they end up doing nothing for the show. None of the character designs, backgrounds or music in this anime are in any way memorable. They&#039;re not bad, they&#039;re just kind of there. <br />
<br />
And now I must address the fan service. I&#039;m all for fan service if it is appropriate for the anime you&#039;re making. However, it&#039;s really misplaced for this particular show, but they throw it in there way more than this story really needs. Half the suggestive scenes in this show do literally nothing to advance the plot. If they were more scarce I wouldn&#039;t care, but every episode expect a pg-13 scene in there and most of them feel forced. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s enough of a story to keep my somewhat interested, so I&#039;m not dropping the show just yet, but it&#039;s barely hanging on to my view list.

    So what does the title, YU-NO: A girl who chants love at the bound of this world actually mean? After watching this anime I am still at a loss to determine what it means and how it fits into the overall story. However, to unpick it here would be to provide spoilers – so suffice to say I’ll leave it as my interpretation being the strength of love (and a little zygyte) can draw two characters together, no matter the distance, no matter the dimensional barriers that they face.<br />
<br />
Despite the ambiguity of the title, it doesn’t mean the anime is poor, in fact I found

          <span style="display: none;" id="review322353">
        it quite entertaining. I had no idea coming into it exactly what its history or pedigree was – I came in as a cleanskin, with no preconceived ideas. As such I found it quite entertaining. Not without flaws, but entertaining nonetheless. Whether it is better than the source material it is based upon – others can argue, but for me, the story was interesting, new and multi-faceted.<br />
<br />
The story itself contains two main arcs, one on earth or one of the many versions of reality – and the second in another world. The setup is quite well done – and like the ominous tapestry that hangs on various walls throughout the story, contains many threads that are gradually linked together. While not every thread is resolved, the main plot points are addressed and the ending reasonably satisfying, especially for those who are into Electra complexes.<br />
<br />
The story focusses on the branches of reality and the many-world concept or multiverse. And that every action or decision we make can have an impact and create a new branch of reality. The viewer is whacked over the head a few times to drive this concept home – and that while history can not be changed, and some events are set. Then the main character, Takuya goes on to break those rules and potentially change history or have history change under his nose. Sigh…<br />
<br />
There is a little exposition on the concepts of the multiverse, what it means and how it operates, and frankly I could have used more explanation – rather than the same one or two concepts being explained over and over. But that said – enough world building and rules were developed to allow the viewer to reasonably follow what was happening. However, I still scratch my head as to how Takuya’s father was able to communicate with him – or why, outside of a simple plot device.<br />
<br />
If I was to be critical it would be on the second arc – the typical isekai adventure. It seemed too much license and gratuitous coincidence was introduced, more to shock the viewer than for any legitimate plot exposition. That said – the arc was coherent in driving towards an ultimate outcome and worked to drive a final showdown of good versus evil with a typically non-typical ending.<br />
<br />
Overall the anime held my attention throughout its 26 episodes and 9 hours of screen time. At the end I was satisfied – although glad it was finished and ultimately I would recommend for those who like the sci-fi, drama, mystery genre.<br />

    Ok, so a version of &#039;YUNO&quot; from 1996 was basically revived using the same character, but studio &quot;Feel&quot; decided to not follow the hentai version, and made this remake a more wholesome thing, even though the ecchi were toned downed. <br />
<br />
So<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
Pros: It was still the usual time travel sci-fi themed anime, where character gets transported into different timeline in order to make corrections, but this one was more half half, cu&#039;z half of it would be the MC making changes in time in order to save the ones he love, but half of it , well that when it becomes an isekai thing, where the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319220">
        MC now goes to an alternate world and gets stuck there for a while, but then again:<br />
<br />
Cons: It would have been better if they from studio &quot;Feel&quot; would still follow as to how the hentai version ended, not including  the hentai scene. <br />
<br />
Verdict 5/10<br />
<br />
Art<br />
<br />
Pros: Expect to see some fanservices around here.<br />
<br />
Cons: But the the hentai version of fanservices. <br />
<br />
Verdict 7/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
Pros: It was kinda good that most of the seiyyus who did adult voices did it properly, given that they don&#039;t have to voice a Joshikausei.<br />
<br />
Cons: The ones who voices Yuno, Mio and Kanna were a big too old to voice such young character. <br />
<br />
Verdict 7/10<br />
<br />
Character<br />
<br />
Pros: Ok so we have this danshi guy who was the MC around here, yes you could say that he&#039;s the hero here since he has to be this one who has to travel from different timeline in order to save the one he cares, but..............<br />
<br />
Cons: I really don&#039;t like that he has this attitude of being a bad ass yankee, cu&#039;z at one point he&#039;s a hero, but there were some instances where he acts like a sex offender.   <br />
<br />
Verdict 3/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
<br />
Pros: It was fairly enjoyable , when I have to see some fanservice around here. Also, it was nice to see something like this have a clean ending.<br />
<br />
Cons: I just don&#039;t like the way it ended. <br />
<br />
Verdict 6/10<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
<br />
Verdict 6/10<br />
<br />
Like I&#039;ve said it was nice that this has a clean ending, but I really don&#039;t like the way it ended, I would have preferred the hentai version&#039;s ending.  <br />

    As someone who has read the Visual Novel (both 1996 and 2019), i can tell you that this adaption feels somewhat rushed and very much could have had greater potential. The result of this was mainly due to the number of episodes. <br />
<br />
What essentially made YU-NO was the ideas and concepts behind the meaning of the plot which was thinned down a ton and even some were never mentioned. This somewhat made it easier to understand, but those ideologies were the key to its success in its era of time.<br />
<br />
The plot felt very weak, I see where they were trying to go with it but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321490">
        in actual fact, it harmed the protagonist in the way in which does not compare to how he acts in the VN. His personality doesn&#039;t feel interesting overall especially where it mattered most. And the suspense was very much weaker in this adaptation. I would personally say that some scenes were executed nicely but don&#039;t outweigh the negatives. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s nothing special about the art, it&#039;s your usual clean modern generic style but doesn&#039;t give that same mature vibe as the original, they definitely could have gone with a better art style than this. The same goes for the OST, they did use some amazing tracks but not all. <br />
<br />
I personally wouldn&#039;t recommend this to anyone and I&#039;d say invest time to play the game instead before watching the anime (Game is around 30 hours anime is 10 hours).

    Short Summary<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind that i have played the visual novel and watched the anime. I liked the visual novel very much, it got its fame for the reason. But anime could not justice with the story and characters for the reason of length. They did manage to complete the skeleton of the human body, but the same body lacks muscles, skin and features. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
I will rate it 6/10 for the following reasons<br />
<br />
Positive Points:<br />
<br />
1. It gives the viewers near realistic concept of time travel. At least, attempts so<br />
2. There is practically no filler in the story, the viewer may find a piece of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319560">
        story boring or interesting however, comparing with the game, attempt had been made to nullify the fillers to near zero<br />
3. Addressed minor problems in VN well. <br />
<br />
Negative Points:<br />
The story did not spend enough time to convince the viewers about its concept and plots, the viewer can easily feel it as another &quot;Sakai&quot;  genera based anime, In fact, I opine, it assumes the viewers  might have either watched &quot;Stiens&#039; Gate&quot; or played the visual novel of this anime or &quot;Stiens Gate<br />
<br />
It feels unpolished, there are problems with &quot;how the story flows&quot;. The original visual novel needed some polishing back then, &quot;Stiens Gate&quot; did that job well, however, it feels the directors must have forgotten to polish the story of the original visual novel.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art (8/10)<br />
<br />
The anime attempted to look characters as realistic as possible. I liked it, no problems at all. But, i leave the last 2 points for pure subjective judgement. So, i just don&#039;t feel like giving it a 10 score.<br />
<br />
Sound (7/10)<br />
<br />
Well, It was good. Not good enough to make me search the same on the you tube. However, it matches with art fair enough. <br />
<br />
Characters (4/10)<br />
<br />
Now, this is something, that is really messed up. For example, if you have just watched the anime. You dont know Yu no at all, the main character of the show. a straight 4 points deduction out of ten.<br />
<br />
However, they designed Sayless well, same goes with royal guards and amanda and her faction well,<br />
<br />
I deducted 2 points for the anime not being able to well in terms of inter-character relations<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (7/10)<br />
<br />
I just wanted to see something that a visual novel can not do, &quot;animation&quot;, which anime did well, so i enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
Overall (6/10)<br />
<br />
in view of the above, it can be safely said that the company did not have enough time/budget to cover up the visual novel better. The anime would be a lot better, if it<br />
<br />
1. Had 35-40 episodes<br />
2. Would able to convince viewers about plot (which in my opinion is the most important aspect in the anime)<br />
<br />
Then, i would have rated the anime an 8 score.

    Pros: OP/ED TIER GOD<br />
Animation was pretty good<br />
More easily to understand than the original visual novel.<br />
Seiyuus 10/10 imo...<br />
<br />
Cons: They didn&#039;t fully use the amazing OST from the game<br />
         The final episode was so &quot;open&quot;(or should I say Cliffhanger) imo<br />
<br />
Now...the history was so good imo, how they &quot;play&quot; all the routes of the Visual Novel was OK... My favourite route I think was the &quot;Mio Route&quot;... was so interesting for me... Now the secound cour of YU-NO... hmmm I think it was interesting... But in the anime we have some changes...e.g: in the second opening we see &quot;Eriko-sensei&quot; in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318872">
        Dela Granto... in the Visual Novel the meeting with her was so surprising... And some phylosophical explications that she tell to Takuya were shortest than in the visual novel... However... to be my first anime of  &quot;space-time travel&quot; I liked him a lot... I´d recommend it 100x100 ...<br />
Now I just read that YU-NO&#039;s visual novel was the one who inspired Steins; Gate... so... I think I should see Steins; Gate

    After years of passive consumption I now find myself for the first, and hopefully last, time compelled to write a review. I want to go on a much MUCH longer spiel about this but I just can&#039;t, not to mention the amount of spoilers there would be, so I&#039;ll cut straight to it:<br />
<br />
This is a story that, like the first time, should not have been adapted. This is a better attempt however.<br />
<br />
If this anime and the new iteration of the visual stood on their own as a new IP I would probably be able to consider this an average series or a somewhat decent time

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314888">
        filler; unfortunately I am familiar with the original source material(PC&#039;98 and Sega Saturn iterations) and each episode does nothing but send me into a deeper melancholy.<br />
<br />
Very little of what made the original great makes it&#039;s way into the remake and the following points apply mainly to the anime but also the new variant of the visual novel:<br />
<br />
The character&#039;s personalities have been dumb&#039;d down to more stereotypical levels, Takuya is especially generic now(hard to really do this character right when half of it&#039;s personality originally revolves around interacting with the player I guess though...)<br />
<br />
The story has been modified in many ways to appeal to a wider audience and be less complex. This results in plot devices being under utilized, certain elements removed or replaced with filler content(the beach segments come to mind...) and brilliant plot lines being left out; ones that are left in come off feeling half baked or introduced at very awkward moments since elements of the original scenarios which glued them together were cut.<br />
<br />
The renditions of the music used are a shadow of the great stuff the late Ryu Umemoto composed, they should&#039;ve went with something else entirely. What we got instead feels straight tragic in comparison.<br />
<br />
The art has been modernized resulting in something that looks like your average 2012 anime, a step down compared to the Saturn version.<br />
<br />
<br />
All in all this is just a really sad affair, the first episode really had me thinking it might turn out okay but by the third I was already losing hope. In retrospect I should&#039;ve expected this though. YU-NO is an exploratory story and that is something the animated format cannot replicate.<br />
<br />
If you want to actually experience something great, which the new VN is not, do yourself a favor and hit up the fan translation that patches together the best of the PC&#039;98, Saturn and Windows versions. It is so good that some of the original staff approved of it.

    (Pre-read Note: I had not played or heard of YU-NO&#039;s original VN before watching the anime adaptation so this is a review from a person who went in blind. I still haven&#039;t touched the VN btw.)<br />
<br />
To start off, Kono Yo no Hate de Koi wo Utau Shoujo YU-NO is adapted from a famous VN from the 90s. We all know that adaptations usually never go well, but I will only be reviewing it as an anime and not rating it as a comparison to it&#039;s VN.<br />
<br />
Story (7/10)<br />
The story of YU-NO is a very interesting one regardless of how many sci-fi anime you&#039;ve watched. It has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333967">
        a unique combination of parallel worlds and time travel that&#039;s a little messy but still works. I was seriously digging the theories that were created because of how it sort of made sense. The first arc with Ayumi was what really grabbed the attention of the viewers with the strong thriller vibes and emotions. The other arcs were a bit of let down though due to the lack of impact they really had. The most lackluster arc was the last arc since everything was extremely rushed. It had little to no world building and the details in between time skips were poorly explained most of the time. The worst part of the story would be the lack of explanation with the parallel worlds. Every time an arc ends, Takuya is sent back to the beginning, but why is he? They talk about causality and the correction of each parallel world, but it seriously lacks the amount of information that sci-fi concepts need. The best part of the story was when everything started to connect, especially on the last few episodes. If they were allowed to make another 26 episodes, I think the anime would have definitely had a stronger story and impact.<br />
<br />
Art (7/10)<br />
I love Studio feel&#039;s art style and character designs, but as an artist I saw a lot of things that I just couldn&#039;t help but let bug me. I won&#039;t go into detail, but there were a lot of shortcuts on some scenes that lowered detail quality, but I get it, they were assigned a budget and had to stick with it. The design of the city and buildings were a bit bland but the landmarks and background are what really caught my eye. I loved the design of the mountain as this tower that clearly wasn&#039;t naturally made. The futuristic yet, medieval design of Dela Granto was pretty refreshing to see. You always see how isekais show the world as a typical RPG but Dela Granto was a completely different from everything else. I like to play Devil&#039;s Advocate when it comes to CGI, but I think that CGI is a smart move for animation studios so I don&#039;t care too much for it. Of course, it still bugs me when I see it as it&#039;s extremely awkward when it goes from a drawing to a 3D model.<br />
<br />
Sound (6/10)<br />
I feel like the soundtrack was pretty bland. They had some good ones as jazz background music, but other than that, it felt like there wasn&#039;t even music there most of the time. The &quot;sad&quot; soundtracks could have been done better with some added strings or piano bits, but they could have really improved it with some orchestral arrangements. Not much else to say here.<br />
<br />
Character(6/10)<br />
Most, if not all, of the characters except Takuya seem very superficial throughout the story. The scripts were pretty basic and the voice acting seemed like they were just &quot;doing they&#039;re job&quot;. It kind of felt like Takuya was a real person and everyone around him was just an NPC. Most of them either had too little or too much emotion in them. For example, Yuki had way too much emotion and kind of ruined the character. Eriko-sensei had good interactions with the characters, but she lacked the emotion in scenes where it would have been appropriate like when she meets Abel again. I get that this is how their characters are designed to be, but it wasn&#039;t strong enough.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (8/10)<br />
I thoroughly enjoyed the series from beginning to end. The mystery, drama, suspense, and shock factor were all mixed in well. It had my heart pounding a lot of the time and left me wondering who was going to be killed. The sci-fi concepts were implemented in way that the average person could understand at a basic level which made it work well. Watching Takuya progress through each world and save that arc&#039;s heroine only to disappear from that world entirely and go to another was honestly a little heart breaking. The tragedy included into the final arc made for a nice plot twist.<br />
<br />
Overall (7/10)<br />
It may have been a big impact for the 90s to have received this kind of story, but it isn&#039;t nearly as strong in this modern age of anime where its concepts are already overused and sometimes abused. It was a good show, but it didn&#039;t reach the bar that other anime have raised. I wouldn&#039;t say that it was a poor execution, but rather a lack of resources(time, budget, etc.) that made it a 7/10. I&#039;ll probably pick up the modern VN to get a full look into the story and characters though.<br />
<br />
P.S I first saw this anime from a YouTube clip with Yuno and Takuya and wanted to watch it immediately. From this clip, I thought that it would be ANOTHER isekai anime(Isekai is my guilty pleasure genre), but boy was I wrong lmao

    I&#039;m dropping this, and I can&#039;t believe I stuck with it as long as I did. Overall there is NO story that I can tell. The story is mismatch together with no coherent knowledge of any of the subject matters it explores.<br />
<br />
We&#039;ll be a fantasy with elves, nope, then it becomes time travel, and that&#039;s it&#039;s main thing, although it has the MC jumping time lines, yet a &quot;hard reset&quot; happens after he gets an item when yeets himself out of that timeline, and leaving each timeline without him, it makes absolutely no sense when you consider how time travel works.<br />
<br />
It soon becomes a futuristic

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314072">
        story and that&#039;s where I stopped. Again it makes no sense what so ever.<br />
<br />
Sound and Art or more or less the same, mediocre with plenty of reused backdrops and settings as if they rushed an already rushed story. Why it&#039;s getting 26 episodes when it doesn&#039;t even deserve that is beyond me.<br />
<br />
Character: Well the MC is all about those women and protecting them and flirting with each and everyone of them, including the teachers. He doesn&#039;t even try to hid it. There are no note worthy characters in this anime as the plot for each is shallow and strung together but some &quot;logic&quot;.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t even say I enjoyed it, usually with time travel story, you have a mystery going for it, something the MC learns and goes though, well he does that, but the hard reset starts him from the beginning and he chose a different path without any concerns over the previous ones or even referring back to them.<br />
<br />
Overall, this is a waste of your time to watch, and a waste of the animators effort into a story that isn&#039;t even worth the time nor money it took to make. You can find better sub par stories than this that have a slight bit more of plot and enthusiasm to it&#039;s story else where.

    This anime broke my brain. I can&#039;t even fathom that some people managed to complete this trash. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t remember in which episode the protagonist repeatedly saw his step mom being raped by her junior, just so she could cover up the mistake of the protagonist, which was that he had misplaced some papers at home; and then the junior blackmailed his mom saying that if she doesn&#039;t open her legs for him; he would not help her find those papers. I watched it a long time ago, probably right after it was released, it took me so many years to finally recover from that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review408238">
        crap and I gathered some courage to write a review on this trash. So basically the half of the anime is based on a kid trying to save his mom from getting raped but he can&#039;t actually save her because every time he goes back in time he creates a new timeline, which means now there are multiple realities where she was raped and there are multiple versions of her now, they are just dead because every version of her committed suicide. After finally he manages to create a reality where she doesn&#039;t get raped, after that he embarks on a journey that is so F**ed up that you would regret that you were born in this world; where such anime exists.<br />
<br />
Sorry guys, PTSD calling, I&#039;ll leave you with that and if you have a spare brain to waste then sure try this anime, believe me, if you don&#039;t have the courage to suicide and you really want to, this will give you the motivation you lack. <br />
<br />
<br />
But, at the end, it&#039;s my fault. I am the one to blame because I ignored all red flags that I encountered every episode, I knew some brain dead horny zombie wrote this script who isn&#039;t even familiar with the basics of Time-Travel world building logic. If you are a Sci-Fi fan, this anime is not for you.<br />

    Visual novel adaptions tend to fit into 2 groups: Great adaptions like Steins;Gate, Clannad, Fate/Stay Night UBW, and Poor adaptions like Chaos;Head and ISLAND. Since the average length of a VN is far longer than a 1-2 cour anime, a lot of material tends to be sacrificed in the adaption process.<br />
<br />
As a non VN reader, i&#039;d not consider this to fall into either camp. Although it feels rushed in places, what&#039;s not been rushed is good enough to keep it above being bad. Clearly a few extra episodes would have made the final arc work far better than it did, while the first few arcs

          <span style="display: none;" id="review322443">
        were mostly well paced. And overall, it does seem like a good anime, even with it&#039;s flaws. <br />
<br />
Both OPs and EDs fit the series well, with the first op being similar to Hacking to the gate, not too surprising since they were all written by the same composer as it, and most of the SciAdv series OPs/EDs. While the second OP doesn&#039;t make an appearance until late, it&#039;s well timed as it fits with the second arc well.<br />
<br />
The actual ost is good, though in the first few eps it&#039;s not played much. Later on it feels much more impactful.<br />
<br />
Art is generally good, the backgrounds look better than many other series and overall it looks decent even if some of the actual animation is a bit lacking. Characters are also drawn well throughout.<br />
<br />
The character designs are decent, though they are changed from their original iteration.<br />
<br />
As for the story itself: The original VN, not the remake this is based on was an Eroge, and some of the plot definitely is affected by that. It&#039;s not noticeable, mostly, except for one short scene, and some of the later direction of the plot.<br />
<br />
There is also a hentai Ova of the series, which i have not watched. Also it might spoil the series, so i&#039;d advise avoiding it until at least finishing this.<br />
<br />
The story is a bit of a mix of mystery and straightforward, with some of it being arc based and part of it continuing throughout the series. It definitely changes tone a few times, with the totally-not-a-hentai-protagonist&#039;s relationships with the various female characters being a notable part. It&#039;s not a harem though, due to the nature of the story due to a central plot element. The series is definitely takes quite a serious tone in parts, notably the first few episodes and the last arc.<br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s a well made adaption, though one that would be better served by having more time to develop it&#039;s story and characters. It&#039;s rushed, though not badly. After all, it is enjoyable on it&#039;s own, though not sure how it would hold up as a VN reader. Since it adapts an old source material, there is probably not a huge amount of interest in this series, though the remake was released fairly recently.<br />
