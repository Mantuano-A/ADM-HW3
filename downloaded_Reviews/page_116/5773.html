The story is set in an alternative universe, in which self-proclaimed Emperor Vetti seeks nothing but power over others; the handsome lone wolf Cleo - who carries the blood of the overthrown royal family - seeks to bring down Vetti; and the rebel aristocrat Michel Volban seeks to establish a people&#039;s republic.  Michel eventually teams up with Cleo, and the main story unfolds from there.<br />
<br />
Each of these three men harbors a major secret concerning their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10705">
        identity; and some adult themes are explored starting around episode 11 or so.  Despite the general adventure theme look of the anime at first, it&#039;s really not for younger kids.<br />
<br />
The production design is interesting and eye-catching, particularly the medieval-inspired costumes.  There are strange anomalies, like the fact that apparently humans in this alternative universe don&#039;t need atmospheres on their planets in order to breathe(!).<br />
<br />
I rented Glass no Kantai because I&#039;m an Akira Ishida fan.  He plays Vetti, the villain, with a much lower and deeper voice than he normally uses - and it&#039;s very sexy too.  ;)<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re an Akira Ishida fan, or if you like the &amp;quot;different&amp;quot; animes, the ones that don&#039;t quite fit neatly into any one category - you might like Glass no Kantai.

    A lot of anime are influenced by others in one way or another, but rarely have I seen one that shows its influences as blatently as &quot;Glass no Kantai - La legende du vent de l&#039;univers&quot; (wow, what an exceedingly long and pretentious sounding title). This anime rips off so many sources and does it so badly and in such a painfully obvious way, that the result is comparable to a patchy rag doll, crudely sewn together from many different pieces of cloth.<br />
<br />
Though at the time of viewing I remember noticing many similarities between &quot;Glass&quot; and numerous other anime, now I&#039;ve either forgotten what most

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27250">
        of those anime were, or I&#039;ve forgotten the similarities in question. However, I do remember thinking that it appear to be ripping off &quot;Last Exile&quot; in particular.<br />
<br />
Right from the start the signs were there. The opening of the first episode featured two fleets of flying ships doing battle, with people in the ship dressed like aristocrats. Hmmm where have I seen this before... of course - these were exactly the exact same things that caught my attention in the opening scenes of &quot;Last Exile&quot;! In what is possibly a feeble attempt to reduce the glaring similarities, the creators of Glass have decided to set this in space, rather than on a steampunk world. But soon enough, more similarities piled up, too many to be coincidental. To name a couple: a rogue ship making a flashy entrance in a fashion similar to that of a certain other rogue ship from &quot;Last Exile&quot; - even the skills exhibited by the two ship captains are pretty similar. Also, the tactics deployed by Admiral Gawain in the big ship to ship battle mid series could easily have been inspired by the the brilliantly orchestrated battle at Dragon Fang in... well you can probably guess where. Perhaps on their own, these similarities can be dismissed as coincidence. But so many in a single anime strongly implicates some serious plagiarism going on. If it isn&#039;t for the fact the Gonzo made both &quot;Last Exile&quot; and &quot;Glass no Kantai&quot;, the makers of the latter would probably get sued.<br />
<br />
As if blatent rip offs aren&#039;t bad enough, the production of anime is often downright terrible. I suspect I would be in for a laugh when, about 30 seconds into the jpoppy opening theme, a totally inappropriate bit of rapping is thrown in, no doubt in an attempt to make the anime seem &quot;cool&quot;. And sure enough, this anime did indeed deliver plenty of laughs, virtually all of it unintended. There is some flakey, overarching plot over the whole thing, and some of its ideas definitely has merit, but it&#039;s often let down by the production and the wooden characters. Plot progression wise, it&#039;s probably the opposite of &quot;Monster&quot;, where the plot execution is done almost to perfection. In &quot;Glass no Kantai&quot;, there are numerous parts where the plot progression feels forced, bewildering or like they&#039;ve plainly just cocked up. Prime example of this is the &quot;twist&quot; in the early episodes regarding one of the characters - the producers manage to shoot themselves in the foot and actually caused me to inadvertently stumble upon it without knowing it was meant to be a twist to be revealed later on (it sounds complicated, but you&#039;ll exactly know what I mean when you see it). The character are also fairly incompetently done. Other than ripping off from other works that came before it (&quot;Creo&quot; is basically Alex Rou from &quot;Last Exile&quot; with a dash of the devil may care attitude of Spike Spiegal from &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, Michele Volban is also ripped off another character that I can&#039;t actually name, as it will &quot;spoil&quot; the aforementioned twist for you), the character development feels heavy handed in general and just plain ridiculous at times.<br />
<br />
Despite all its flaws (like, all 402 of them), the series isn&#039;t all bad. The Admiral Gawain part of the story is pretty good, despite stealing its battle strategies from &quot;Last Exile&quot;. Some of plot points are also well executed and shows hints of promise... but it&#039;s just that most of its flaws are amplified simply because it&#039;s an anime that takes itself waaay too seriously. It obviously fancies itself to be something of a sweeping epic, perhaps not too disimilar to the kind of grand operatic feel found in &quot;Gankutsuou&quot;. The music, arguably the one aspect of &quot;Glass no Kantai&quot; that&#039;s not riddled with flaws, do manage to provide an orchestral score befitting the epic it&#039;s *trying* to be. But that air of grandeur it&#039;s trying to achieve is something an anime can only get away with if it has genuine class... like &quot;Gankutsuou&quot;, for example. &quot;Glass&quot; asks to be ridiculed far too often for its better points to be noticed (they do exist, few though they may be). In fact, for a long while one of my friends couldn&#039;t work out whether &quot;Glass no Kantai&quot; is meant to be completely serious or a tongue in cheek comedy (true story, I kid you not)!<br />
<br />
Presentation wise, this anime isn&#039;t bad. Though visually the anime appears to be quite pleasing at first, I soon found that a lot of the character designs seem a little... off, for lack of a better word. It&#039;s as though they tried to go for some attractive character designs, but did not quite succeed. The general feel of the anime is that it&#039;s trying to create a big budget affect with a small budget, so it cheapness often glares out from beneath a thin facade. There is this one hilarious scene where one guy fights a group of soldiers. The soldiers unleash a barrage of arrows at him... and he somehow manage to single handedly unleash a barrage of similar size back at them... with his one crossbow. You&#039;ll really have to see it to fully appreciate the unintended comedy of the situation! It just felt so cheap! But due to &quot;Glass no Kantai&quot; severely lacking in substance, the presentation, despite feeling amateurish, is probably its strongest department. &quot;Amateurish&quot; is probably a word that can be applied to the anime as a whole. As much as I love Gonzo at their best (&quot;Last Exile&quot;, &quot;Gankutsuou&quot;, &quot;Hellsing&quot; springs to mind), they do produce far too much cheap trash like this (&quot;Gad Guard&quot; springs to mind here). They should just concentrate on making a few great series instead of wasting their time and money by pumping out crap. I mean seriously... do they really think they&#039;ll can con people out of their hard earned cash with anime of this calibur?!

    It&#039;s rare but not unheard of for two big-name studios to produce an anime together--Mahoromatic (Shaft, Gainax) is another example that comes to mind. I&#039;ll admit, I haven&#039;t seen enough by Satelight to be familiar with their work, but I will say that these visuals have Gonzo written all over them, and not in a good way. Character designs are unnaturally shiny and angular, the backgrounds are occasionally good but the garish technicolor abyss they call space is an absolute eyesore. There are a few decent swordfights but for the most part shortcuts are rampant, movements are stiff, and for every viscerally captivating moment there

          <span style="display: none;" id="review81454">
        are a dozen terribly sloppy ones. The CG elements are mostly reserved for ships and off-planet habitats, making them obvious but still tolerable, and the CG touches on the eponymous glass ship actually work to positive effect, giving it a genuine glass feel. Still, it doesn&#039;t make up for the rest of what goes on. Finally, an anime I can honestly call ugly. Yes, it is ugly. Moving on.<br />
<br />
The music is actually pretty good, if a bit typical for a space opera, all blaring trumpets and soaring strings. It can get a bit repetitive but it supports the show well for the most part. Still, during some of its dramatic moments it can get pretty overblown. I can honestly say that the most memorable moment in the show, musically speaking, involved Cleo and Vetti simply passing each other by in separate carriages. The scene was supposed to radiate biting tension, but the musical choice was so melodramatic it actually became unintentionally hilarious. That&#039;s not to belittle it, though, it&#039;s still a solid score all in all.<br />
<br />
The voice acting is a decent listen in both languages, but since the setting is clearly intended to be faux-Renaissance the dub ends up with a weird variety of accents, ranging from vaguely British to ambiguously Eastern-European, with varying degrees of success. If nothing else, Christopher R. Sabat as a pseudo-Roman is delightful. Laura Bailey and Yuko Kaida both play Michel effectively (yes, Michel is played by a woman in both languages, wink wink nudge nudge), but with Vetti and Cleo it gets a bit stickier. In the dub, Jason Liebrecht plays a fairly detached Vetti with a snide streak, which is part of his character. Akira Ishida, however, adds a dominating, slightly vulgar touch while still managing to carry his sympathetic moments. It&#039;s a great performance. With Cleo, it&#039;s the opposite. His Japanese seiyuu, Kenjirou Tsuda, plays the character&#039;s confidence as a cheeky to the point of coming off as a bit childish, while Travis Willingham makes the character&#039;s voice resonate with experience to back his confidence. Language preferences will split where they always do, and if you can go either way I&#039;d suggest giving both tracks a fair shake. At least, I would if I thought this show was worth watching.<br />
<br />
The &quot;space opera revolution&quot; concept has been done to death, and within Gonzo&#039;s portfolio alone it&#039;s not hard to find other series from which Glass Fleet clearly took some pointers, most notably Last Exile. Still, this isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing. While it&#039;s always nice to see something genuinely fresh and unconventional, cliches can be comforting if they&#039;re backed with solid execution, but Glass Fleet is not an example of this. The pacing is hacky and sophomoric, jumping between events with little explanation and often giving the impression that key transitory scenes were cut to save screentime. The setting is poorly constructed, with slaves performing manual labor under the whip that ought to be easily achievable considering the technology presented, and for whatever reason humans have no trouble surviving exposure to the vacuum of space. Several key concepts, such as why setting foot on a planet is taboo, are left unexplained, and as if that&#039;s not enough, every episode begins with Michel philosophizing at us with a cup of tea.<br />
<br />
All of this awkwardness would have been forgivable, though, if only the writers knew how to create strong characters. Despite the derivative setting, I&#039;m certain there&#039;s a great story hiding somewhere in here. The concept of a savior who isn&#039;t cut out for the responsibility is actually a really good one. I would&#039;ve loved a story of Michel sharpening his leadership skills and gradually earning Cleo&#039;s respect and support, and in the process perhaps becoming a better savior in his own right. Alas, neither Michel nor Cleo have the character strength to carry such a story. This is especially shocking considering the amount of detail put into both of their backstories, but the story fails to make any meaningful connections between who they were then and who they are now.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve referred to Michel as &quot;he&quot; up to this point, but the show makes so little effort to hide the truth from its audience that it hardly constitutes a spoiler when I inform you that Michel is actually a women masquerading as her brother. What&#039;s wrong with this? They do nothing with this subplot, despite the implied importance of gender roles in-universe. There are a few little attempts to explore her dual identity, but they&#039;re tacked-on and half-assed. As the story nears its end, the writers suddenly decide that everyone should know the truth, and nobody seems to care about it in the least. Even her confrontation with the original Michel doesn&#039;t prompt any development. Her role as a savior is equally underexplored, and considering she leads a group called the &quot;People&#039;s Army&quot; you&#039;d think she&#039;d spend more time interacting with the common people she supposedly champions. Her relationship with Cleo is okay, but only just. It doesn&#039;t help that her comrades are pretty weak characters to play off of. Her servants Jean and Sylua get a fair amount of screentime but no worthwhile development, and the rest of the People&#039;s Army is hardly worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
Cleo&#039;s character is hardly better off. His backstory is pretty well fleshed-out but the gap between his childhood and forming the crew of his glass battleship is left unexplained. His apathy toward responsibility to the people early on is especially baffling when we meet his mentor, who you&#039;d think would have instilled stronger ideals in him. To be fair his character does genuinely develop and change for the better as time goes by, and his grounded attitude and unique viewpoint place him a notch above Michel, but it&#039;s only a notch. He&#039;s not nearly as strong a character as he really ought to be, certainly not enough to carry the show on his own. It doesn&#039;t help that his crewmates are pretty weak characters to play off of. Heizak is a big Roman who mans up when he puts his helmet on, Nowy is a wimpy boy who freaks out when his glasses fall off, and Barrett is a little too mysterious for his own good. The only member of his crew they attempt to develop at all is his pilot Eimer, and with only limited success.<br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s Vetti, who could&#039;ve been the most interesting of our three leads. An egoist to his very core, his reason for seeking to unify the galaxy stems from a desire for power and a need to save his own life. These are the ingredients for an utterly despicable character, but then there are his conflicting relationships with Ralph, his closest childhood friend, and Rachel, the daughter of the pope to whom he finds himself engaged in a relationship of convenience that may or may not evolve into more than just convenience. Once again, this is potentially interesting material, but the writers have no idea how sympathetic they want Vetti to be, giving him a few moments of tenderness followed by long periods of him being an irredeemable douchemuffin. The backstory they ultimately give him is not only one of the cheapest ways of attempting to make a character sympathetic, but it ends up making him even more despicable, which makes his one-eighty at the end come off as forced. It also doesn&#039;t help that Ralph and Rachel are pretty weak characters to play off of. Ralph is clingy and jealous and that&#039;s just about it, while Rachel starts off as a strong female character in her own right but starts devolves into lovesick madness for pretty much no reason at all.<br />
<br />
To be fair, the ending makes a decent attempt to bring all the main characters&#039; arcs to acceptable resolutions, but the plot and character development leading up to it were too weak to carry it through; it was too little too late. A few neat ideas are constantly sidelined to make way for a generic plot, there&#039;s hardly any sense of genuine tension when the true conflict rears its head, and the characters are interesting in theory but pathetically written. The most interesting character in the entire series is probably B.B., a wine merchant who controls a sizable portion of the galaxy&#039;s neutral forces, and the writers even find an excuse to cheapen her character at one point when her wine cellar is raided. There are some decently entertaining moments mixed in, and a few strong scenes that really do work, but they simply aren&#039;t enough to make the rest of the show worth slogging through.<br />
<br />
This feels like the kind of show where the people who made it simply didn&#039;t care. The animation is half-assed, the writing is half-assed, the characters are half-assed. I almost would have preferred it if this show was truly bad. Then, at least, it would have been memorable. In all honesty, I still maintain that in good hands this could&#039;ve been something unexpected and special, but far from soaring, Glass Fleet never even manages to take off.

 Glass Fleet Or (glass no Kantai) is a space opera that depicts the &quot;galaxy in revolution&quot; against the Holy Emperor, Vetti. Opposing Vetti&#039;s tyranny is the People&#039;s Army, headed by the enigmatic revolutionary Michelle. Eventually Michelle will seek to enlist the aid of Cleo, captain of a mysteriously powerful glass battleship, and his crew. Throughout the series, the bitter rivalry between Cleo and Vetti becomes increasingly important as the core element of the story.<br />
<br />
 The visuals and character art are good in some parts and just atrocious in others, as the galaxy is populated with vast &quot;Territorial Vessels&quot; or floating landmasses, numerous vessels and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review92355">
        fleets enter galactic battle but the animation is so sub par, that you feel as though your watching a cheap science fiction movie from the early 80&#039;s. The character designs how ever is where the art really shines, some of them all have very unique appeal, as does the battle ships and many other planetary area&#039;s they visit across the galaxy. The many outfits is something to really recognize in this series, each and everyone has their own design for every character.<br />
<br />
However, there was a lot that I did not like about this series. The three main characters (Vetti, Cleo, and Michelle) are all completely self-absorbed, though they may try to justify this to themselves. It becomes readily apparent in the first episode that Michelle is in fact a woman, and when we later learn the reason for this deception. Cleo&#039;s only goal in life is to conquer the galaxy, though for what purpose we never really find out. At numerous points in the series, he tells other characters that he really doesn&#039;t care whether they follow him or not, and intones that his &quot;wind of destiny&quot; is carrying him to a final outcome. In reality, he is an arrogant, stubborn fool who would be totally lost without the skills of his crew to support him. And Vetti, a really nasty piece of work, seems to care for no one, casting aside or eliminating anything that stands between himself and his goal of immortality.<br />
<br />
Other characters are imbalanced and eccentric to the point of annoyance as well. Noe, the encryption genius, is a whiny little boy who becomes completely useless when he loses his glasses, which is often and annoying. The weapons specialist whose name I forget at the moment has the ferocity and testosterone-pumped aggression of a grizzly bear, and the mental capacity of a five-year-old. Towards the middle of the series, one character is thrown into a prison cell with a dozen perverted &quot;lifers&quot; who initially try to do some nasty stuff to her, but then somehow become her best buddies later on in the series.<br />
<br />
This is also a series without moral compass or honor, as the final outcome demonstrates all too admirably. Throughout the series, Vetti has an intimate (sexuality is implied) relationship with Ralph, Vetti&#039;s consort and bodyguard, who is a young boy. Vetti is flagrantly promiscuous and manipulative, obsessing over and then casting aside his &quot;love&quot; interests, including at one point Michelle. After his numerous atrocities, murders, and sins, Vetti becomes the one to unite and rule the galaxy. <br />
<br />
If you like happy endings, this series is not for you. If you believe that evil should be punished and good should triumph, this series is not for you. If you&#039;re looking for some ideas for a creative enterprise and don&#039;t really expect too much else of value, this might be for you. I can&#039;t say I&#039;m glad I watched it (about halfway through I just wanted it to end, and had to alternate episodes with another anime to maintain my sanity), but there are some interesting designs in this series, so I&#039;ll keep it as a reference.<br />
<br />
How ever if your hoping for something along the lines of an epic space opera that dives deep into politics and strategic war battles like Legend of the Galactic Heroes or Crest of the star then this series surely is not it. It tries to hard to fit many different stories intertwined together and ultimately does not carry the weight of what the plot is trying to portray.

    I kinda liked this one..... to be honest i tried it once before and gave up withing 15 mins.... but this second time, i completed all 26 episodes in 2 days.. <br />
<br />
I liked all the characters.... they stayed true to their stories... i mean, no one suddenly changes just because the plot wanted it..... and its not just the leads doing all the work.... the side characters too have their strengths... <br />
<br />
Some of the dialogues were true in real world.... how in a war, both sides think they are right and the honorable one...<br />
<br />
its good for a 1 time watch..

         first let me say i love this kind of anime set up. a time of noble&#039;s and knights. there are so few and even rare good ones. so i hope to find one in glass fleet. sadly the ship blow up and there was no one alive....<br />
    the story: was short for a 24 esp sereis. the people wanted to be free or more right from the noble&#039;s. so they they strike out againtist them. the noble&#039;s fought back. this could have been a good way to start things up but what evil thing&#039;s where the noble&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29638">
        doing? you never saw them killing any of them or hear how the taxes are. there was one noble that destroyed a village for hunting grounds but he gave them a forest to live in and work.they lived in a desert at first, that looked like a trash yard, then moved to a nice forest and got work! so that was a fail to show the evil noble&#039;s. the other part was the black cross. A black hole that lead to a new unervirse. that part of the story was a small part of the series till the end. <br />
  the art: was ok. most of the women looked ugly or plain.(save one the pope&#039;s daughter) other than that ok.<br />
  the sound: felt off to me. the guns on the big space ships did not have the boom they should have. the voice actors sounded bored and did not want to be there. <br />
   the charater: this was a mess. i was bored watching them. they all had a different goal in mind and was a text book motives.<br />
   enjoyment: there is little to be had. I like the era this was place but that was it.<br />
  over all: what killed it for me was the ending. felt like they wanted a different ending from normal and threw it together at the last moment.    without spoiling the series i can say WTF with the last 4 esp! so this is my warning......DO NOT WATCH THIS ANIME!!!

    What I liked about this anime? The really pretty hair/sideburns ornaments/jewelry. Looked always nice. The costume design was really interesting and good.<br />
<br />
I am not an anime expert, but this anime was a mix of many other stories. I saw Star Wars there, a little Escaflowne and quite a bit of steampunk which was cool. Sometimes the animation looked stiff, but it was okay since it was neglectable. On the plus side: there were some cool sword fights as well and at least those moves did not look stiff.<br />
The story and the way it was executed was done fairly well. Good enough to keep me interested

          <span style="display: none;" id="review135789">
        the entire time even though some icidents were predictable. The end was a bit &quot;deus ex machina&quot; even though it was a prophecy with the *spoilers* ancient super advanced magical space ship*spoilers* which solved all problems.<br />
And lol they don`t need atmosphere on those asteroids to survive? harhar.<br />
<br />
Tbh, I started watching this because of the Seiyuu`s TsudaKen and Ishida Akira. And as expected I was delighted. Wahahaha. Specially when TsudaKen said the following lines : &quot;ride my wind&quot;  or &quot;don`t say anything. Just shut up and be mine&quot;. wahaha. <br />
<br />
Annoying characters: Michel aka Lacine sama, who was constantly annoying with her &quot;Nani?&quot;. Lol I also hated her intros with the silly philosophy behind it. And then there are pope Gorna and Rachel who were obsessed with a black hole.<br />
<br />
Cool characters: B.B and Vetti. And then a little Creo. Seriously BB was coolest with her vine.<br />
<br />
This anime was not the greatest, but it was good entertainment if you like sci-fi medieval religious prophecy themed stories. It is strange that there is almost nothing about this on the web. No fandom.<br />

    Racine Blanch, who after learning of her brother’s death in the war, takes his place and name Michel Volban de Cabelle as the leader of the People’s Army. She leads a ragtag of rebels from all classes against the Holy Imperial Emperor, Vetti Lunard Sforza de Roselait. But Vetti’s power is mighty and the rebels will need help. Enter a spectacular glass battleship bearing the crest of the old Royal family, manned by “space pirate” Cleo Aiolos Corbeille de Veil, a man of great abilities who claims to be their descendant. This man and his ship might be the rebels’ last, best hope.<br />
<br />
My thoughts:<br />
<br />
As I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263380">
        began watching Glass Fleet it didn’t stir me one bit. It didn’t seem to hold any surprises and even some scenes were predictable. I hated the way Michel would fly off the handle and the way Cleo was just too laid back. But as I further got into the anime I could see it all slowly building up, coming together. Every character has its own personality and owns them. They don’t come from or act like any character from any other anime I&#039;ve seen, they’re unique. In the end, I enjoyed watching this anime and that surprised me. Even the ending surprised me; it was not what I was expecting. I recommend watching this anime.

    Glass Fleet is studio GONZO’s attempt to make its own version of Legend of Galactic Heroes. That is the same as expecting from a monkey to write something close to Shakespeare, so you know right away it will not end well. Although the basic theme is the same (trying to unite the galaxy under a new, fair leadership) the way everything happens is one big mess. Every single event in this show is based on the rule of cool and not on some sort of strategy or reasoning.<br />
<br />
But it’s not like it doesn’t have its merits. The setting is quite catchy on a superficial level,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321756">
        as you basically have humanity living on scattered asteroids and each one is ruled by nobility. Each time a war or a marriage takes place, the asteroids merge to represent the total space a family rules. And of course each side has its own space fleet to wage war if needed. The decorations on ships, buildings, and uniforms are also very eye-catchy and interesting to keep looking at. All that sound cool and fine in theory and if there was proper handling we would have a masterpiece on our hands.<br />
<br />
But as I said, this is a monkey named GONZO we are talking about so it ain’t gonna happen.<br />
- The animation is subpar for the time the show was made. Very frozen or stiff motions, along with some bad CGI stuff GONZO is so good at making them ugly.<br />
- The detail on character figures is usually very crude. They usually have vague facial structure and thick outlines.<br />
- Unimpressive soundtrack and voice acting. This is supposed to be a serious tale regarding the unification of space and they throw in j-pop garbage and high-pinched voices. Space operas go with epic chorus you fools!<br />
<br />
All the above can somewhat be forgiven if the directing and the storylines are at least decent. And nope, in just the pilot episode alone you can already find stupid scenes full of ludicrous bravado and events that happen for the sake of retarded coolness. Here, let me give you a few examples from the first two episodes.<br />
- The first episode begins with a space battle. One side wins but we are never told how. Something about attacking the enemy from the rear but we are never shown how they did it or why the other side didn’t see it coming.<br />
- The second scene is about a wedding being interrupted by a rebellion. We already had a battle a moment ago and instead of focusing a bit more on that they just threw in another battle??? That takes gravity out of both events.<br />
- And aside from that, the choreography is simply horrible. So much over the top ridiculous stuff happen that you just can’t take it seriously. The funny thing is that it’s not supposed to be comical and it tries to pass as very serious.<br />
- The priest performing the ceremony is in fact the rebel leader. Instead of just attacking the nobles right away, he prefers to first memorize and perform the whole thing before revealing himself. As if it would matter somehow.<br />
- Then the nobles perform an ambush and start bombing the place. The funniest part is when the hit the main square and there is no one there when two seconds ago the place was full of people.<br />
- The rebel leader decides to fight back. For that reason he drinks tea served by a bimbo maid, boards a horse wagon that jumps out of nowhere (which was totally out of place in this setting), and with that goes to his spaceship.<br />
- Said spaceship was all this time disguised as a huge glass building. Why the devil didn’t anyone notice a huge building appearing in the middle of the colony?<br />
- Then he lures the noble fleet by driving them inside a space storm. Specifically his radar officer spots it as they are getting surrounded. He even says “we have a problem, there is a storm ahead” (which is completely retarded since that was clearly the least of their worries at that moment). So they just move towards it and none of the enemy ships detects the storm. Which is simply impossible since the damn thing was big as a planet and they were heading towards it.<br />
- So anyways, the whole space storm thing fails and thus we realize this was nothing more than a cheap way to waste a few minutes.<br />
- But worry not as a magical super transforming spaceship arrives and saves the day. So much for tactics and strategy; all it takes is to have the magic super ship on your side.<br />
And the show goes like this all the way to the end, with everything playing out as the scriptwriter thought it would be cool at the second he was writing it down. Typical crayon-drawing GONZO kids… Of course and the ending is a far fetched fairy tale and of course we get lots of gay vibes in a poor attempt to keep us interested.<br />
<br />
So after all this mess do you think the characters are any better? Nope, they are all one-dimensional comic book villains and heroes. Most of them are goofing around while dressed like they are going to a bondage party instead of trying to rule a galaxy. They are all so simplistic, straightforward and dried up, you end up not caring about any of them. Plus they are desperately trying to be funny and fail miserably since they simply are out of context with whatever is going on around them. Like penguins in a desert. And seriously, I am not into all this pretty boy gay stuff.<br />
<br />
In all, this is an insult to anyone’s intelligence and an example of how a great premise can turn to shit if it’s given to the wrong people. Avoid at all costs and stick to good old Legend of Galactic Heroes, the one and only emperor of all Space Operas.<br />
<br />
p.s. Calling this thing space opera is a bit off, since there is no actual vacuum anywhere. That shows how much they cared about physics while making it.<br />

And now for some excused scorings.<br />
