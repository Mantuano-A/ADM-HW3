    A.I.C.O. Incarnation is an old school sci-fi thrill ride full of great action, plot twists, a good protagonist, and a story with a surprising amount of depth. <br />
<br />
It takes place a futuristic city known for its advanced researching facilities. One day a catastrophe known as the “Burst” puts a swift end to the city’s utopian-like harmony. The Burst creates a giant mass of red matter that wreaks havoc on the outskirts of the city, killing dozens of people.<br />
<br />
Through some relatively wordy exposition, we learn that researchers experimenting with artificial life were the cause of the Burst. Rather than incinerating the monster, the researchers choose to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review273443">
        leave it be while they hide behind a wall around their city. They seek to learn how to create artificial humans by studying the monster, without caring about the actual people still surviving. <br />
<br />
Only days before this catastrophe, our main character Aiko Tachibana gets into a car accident, killing her father but leaving her barely alive. Shortly after her accident, her mother and brother were killed in the Burst. Jump two years after the accident, and she’s rehabilitating, temporally wheelchair-bound. She lives alone, peacefully ignorant of the horrors that occur just beyond the border, but with only the doctors to go home to every day. That is until the enigmatic Yuya Kanzaki transfers to her class, quickly becoming the most mysterious character in the show. From the moment they first meet, her character arc begins, she&#039;s literally thrown from her wheelchair and forced to get herself moving when they bump into each other. Notably, every aspect of the high-tech future is intruiging, the writer details so many pieces of technology in the setting and allows the characters to interact with, and the internal logic stays consistent.<br />

Yuya tells Aiko that her body is an artificial copy created by her father and his fellow researchers before she was nearly killed in her car accident. He urges her that she’s the key to stopping the chaotic red matter and that she must travel with him to outside the city to the matter’s source known as ”Primary Point”. It’s a lot for her to take in as you can imagine, and this crazy story coupled with Yuya’s sterile personality is a recipe for long-term uncertainty between the two. But he gives her a reason to believe, to leave her ignorance and grow up. Her family is still alive at this Primary Point place, so he says. It&#039;s a shaky foundation for her to start off with. However, her frighteningly tough skin (that even repels knives as Yuya rudely demonstrates) and ability to occasionally share thoughts with the red matter pushes her, and us to become invested in their effort to reach the source. <br />
<br />
Together with a group of hired ’divers’ to escort them to the source. They’re funded in secret by one of the more clear-headed researchers who seek to stop the matter rather than study it. They spend a majority of the show on their journey using high tech weaponry and vehicles to survive in the post-apocalyptic outskirts against the matter. This journey is a fight for survival, a fight to save the world. It felt all the more ironic watching these kids (15-20ish-year-olds) on the front lines trying to put an end to the monster that the researchers created and chose to ignore. <br />
<br />
Considering the mixed track record of A.I.C.O.’s series composition staff, I was nervous about how the writing would turn out. Thankfully, the story is quite good, but admittedly the dialogue is rather bland. The writers are aware of their capabilities and they don’t try anything they can’t do well. Overall the end result is simplistic, comprehensive, and it even dives into some themes giving the story depth. A.I.C.O. loves setting up these thematically relevant scenarios to remind you who you&#039;re supposed to be rooting for and what the message is. The show’s color palette tends to be dark and muddy for the post-apocalyptic outskirts, but even this clashes with the semi-utopian appearance of the research city. Adding even more to the thematic duality. Whenever the show isn&#039;t focused on Aiko’s journey it follows the researchers who wish to experiment on her artificial body. She is, after all, one of the first humans to successfully be made out of artificial matter. We get plenty of useful information about Aiko’s origin, the experiments, the red matter, and world-building though seeing the world from the scientists&#039; perspective. The world feels far-fetched but believable thanks to these moments. It’s not just generic sci-fi tacked on; it’s a real-world that reacts to the knowledge-hungry researchers and the fear of the ever-growing red matter.<br />
<br />
The duality between the scientist&#039;s dangerous lust for knowledge and Aiko’s group fighting for a brighter future further makes their roles in the story believable. I never found myself struggling to cheer them along on their epic adventure. Sure it’s straightforward and simplistic, but easy to get engaged with. Not to mention, this structure lends itself well to quieter dramatic character moments to develop its leads. With only a brief twelve episode runtime, these moments are valuable indeed. <br />
<br />
Yuya, along with all the other supporting cast members is relatively flat. Given the large character roster, it’s a blessing it doesn’t increase much after episode two because it gives them some room to be developed. While it takes it a while for characterization to take full shape, I came to like them in a short enough time. I did find myself invested in their arguments against one another, their highs stakes fights against the matter, and occasionally the deaths. These characters are strengthened by well-defined personalities that have visible chemistry one another creating a fair bit of tension between them in and out of the high stakes action. While I wish the supporting cast of hired &#039;divers&#039; were equally developed, I felt like the amount they received was adequate. At least the protagonists and antagonists respectively have clear motives and receive the full development treatment. Solid Japanese voice performances bolster these personalities as well. Not the dub though. Unlike B: The Beginning’s wonderful dub, this one’s full of awkward pauses, boring performances, and the dub’s script is the exact same as the sub’s (no acting direction).<br />
<br />
At many times throughout A.I.C.O, we see quiet moments in which Aiko grapples with the idea that she’s not human. Questioning her existence and cursing her connection to the Burst that stole her family and the lives of many others. At first, I accused her of simply falling into the more trappings and having little to be attached to, but as the conflict deepened, so did her writing. She quite frequently butts heads with Yuya as he’s incredibly single-minded at first. Seeing her as a tool to fix the world rather than a person. They each grow in noticeable and satisfying ways; Aiko overcoming her fragile ignorant self for the sake of her family and friends, and Yuya learning to value emotion rather than only logic. It was a satisfying journey to watch play out, but I wish it had only ended with an equally satisfying conclusion. Everything is wrapped up so quickly and so immaculately that little is left to the imagination. I was left reflecting on the arcs the show successfully followed through on, but after such a cathartic final episode it felt rather restrained to end in the way it did. <br />
<br />
As the show spends a majority of its time in the action-packed escorting scenes, it’s necessary for it to have good visuals at the very least. As expected of studio Bones, it looks good but I wouldn’t take my praise beyond that. There&#039;s an overall old-school style to the visuals that may put some people off due to the lack of details. This style carries over into the character designs, giving them each a defined look while still being of modern quality. The main enemy in the A.I.C.O., the red matter, contorts in ways that look quite frightening (more so when you learn its origins). Rarely does the show get violent, but it does dabble in body horror which is surprisingly effective without relying on gore. <br />
<br />
Action scenes are fast-paced, rarely lingering on a shot to keep moving, but also to hide a lack of detail. There’s plenty of CGI during action scenes, but it looks good from a distance and never hurts the experience. To bolster thrills during action sequences is a pulse-pounding soundtrack with racing piano tracks and intense stringed orchestras. They don&#039;t sound like your everyday action music either, it strives to keep you on the edge of your seat. And oh man, the opening performed by TRUE is fantastic. It tells the story of the show metaphorically and beautifully with an awesome song to back it up. Ending each episode is a wonderfully relaxing song by Aiko&#039;s talent voice actress Haruka Shiraishi, with a simple walking cycle of her with beautiful background art.<br />
<br />
Score Breakdown<br />
[Story: 7/10] Intruiging themes, simplistic, lacking storytelling. <br />
[Character: 6/10] Good protagonist. Large cast gradually developed, but some are left underdone. <br />
[Art: 6/10] Decent CGI, simple animation, old school style.<br />
[Sound: 8/10] Amazing OP, great soundtrack, terrible dub. <br />
[Enjoyment: 8/10] Exciting action, emotional drama, somewhat predictable.<br />
<br />
[Overall Score: 7/10]<br />
Perhaps A.I.C.O. Incarnation played it safer than it could have, but it exceeded my expectations and held my attention. Where it lacks in the unique direction of Devilman Crybaby and the fantastic visuals from B: The Beginning, it makes up for with old-school charm and a satisfying story. Safely earning its place in Netflix&#039;s growing library of great anime.

    A.I.C.O. Tells the story of Japan being overrun with &quot;matter&quot;, a sort of abstract material that destroys everything in it&#039;s path. The story is a bit generic but the pacing make&#039;s up for that. The biggest issue I had with this anime was the main character; Tachibana, Aiko. it&#039;s not that she lacks depth, it&#039;s the way she reacts to every situation. It&#039;s like she was made to be shocked at every turn. And it gets tiresome fast. The best aspect of the anime is the artwork. The elegant animations and fast pace of the series is what kept the two dimensional characters in check

          <span style="display: none;" id="review273553">
        and made the series watchable. I did like the small details that made the world of A.I.C.O feel more authentic, e.g. the artificial suits that needed to be fed in order to function properly. I wish a little more thought was put into the world building of the series, it felt like I was watching a CW series with good visuals. There&#039;s nothing groundbreaking here, but it does make for a good popcorn anime.

    This show is a good example of how important good characters are. A.I.C.O.: Incarnation is visually fantastic with an intriguing story, but it falls flat when it comes to characters. <br />
<br />
Not only does it fail to properly introduce them, but each and every one of them are so badly written it&#039;s pathetic.<br />
For starters, we are given no reason to care about any of them. There are a few &quot;emotional&quot; scenes in this show that are clearly supposed to be tearjerkers, including a death and some drama. But, listen, nobody&#039;s going to cry over a character they don&#039;t care about!<br />
&quot;Oh no, this character that I forgot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review273753">
        the name of and I can&#039;t describe to save my life is dead, so sad.&quot;<br />
<br />
On top of that, there were a considerable amount of scientist side characters that they never introduced and I just... I honestly never knew who they were. Specifically this pink-haired scientist lady that ended up being semi-important. <br />
You can&#039;t just.... throw in random characters and say &quot;they&#039;re important now&quot; without any introduction whatsoever. <br />
As I sat watching the credits of the final episode, I came to the realization that I never found out who she was or why she was there. <br />
<br />
Oh, but I&#039;m getting ahead of myself.<br />
Our main characters, the ones that I previously said give no reason for the audience to care about them, are horrible. <br />
<br />
You see, they had to get to Primary Point, the end goal/location of their mission, quickly. They kept saying how they needed to hurry up, like there was some sense of urgency. <br />
&quot;Like there was some sense of urgency&quot; ... well, there didn&#039;t seem to be for the characters themselves. <br />
<br />
They kept saying how they needed to go faster, get to Primary Point sooner, and it was urgent...! And then they took breaks that lasted basically almost full episodes every episode. <br />
<br />
YOU CAN&#039;T DO THAT. YOU CAN&#039;T KEEP REPEATING THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO HURRY UP AND THEN STAND AROUND NOT PROGRESSING AT ALL FOR SEVERAL HOURS. <br />
They weren&#039;t even doing anything important! They were just bickering and joking around! What? Like,  w h a t ? !<br />
<br />
Because of this, the middle episodes ended up being incredibly repetitive. Some scenes of them fighting Matter, supposed character/plot/lore/I-don&#039;t-even-know development, then more scenes of them goofing around and not doing what they said they should be doing at all.<br />
Yes, because I&#039;m sure everyone wants to see a bunch of flat, generic characters talking to eachother instead of the actual plot progression. <br />
<br />
And don&#039;t even get me started on the two MAIN main characters, Kanzaki and Aiko. If I elaborate on Kanzaki, I&#039;ll reach spoiler territory, so I&#039;ll just say this about Aiko... <br />
I don&#039;t think anyone working on this anime knew what her personality is supposed to be like. She changed sides and opinions every 2 seconds, got super emotional and caused trouble for the sake of plot progression and only for the sake of plot progression, and just in general had no character whatsoever. Long story short, I really hate Aiko. <br />
<br />
Moving on, I wish more things were explained in this show. Some things were painful like, &quot;HERE LET ME TELL YOU MY ENTIRE BACKSTORY AND FEELINGS FOR THE SAKE OF THE AUDIENCE TO INTRODUCE MY CHARACTER, POINTLESS BEST FRIEND WHO IS COMPLETELY UNIMPORTANT&quot; while others were left so unexplained I was very, very confused. <br />
<br />
A.I.C.O.: Incarnation has such an interesting world. One wrapped in mystery and sci-fi that I wanted to know more about. But, no, no. Obviously focusing on the idiot characters and their adventure was more important, right? <br />
It&#039;s not only the world. There were so many characters that I just. I don&#039;t know who they are. At all, actually. There&#039;s a bunch of different sides and organizations and groups and goals and I...! It was so very confusing. <br />
<br />
And now for a brief list of the good things about this anime:<br />
<br />
- Some neat plot twists.<br />
- Quality BONES animation. <br />
- Beautiful character art. I love the eyes.<br />
- Amazing Opening theme.<br />
- A legitimately interesting world. <br />
- Very bingeable. Thanks, Netflix.<br />
- I genuinely enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
Yes, I enjoyed this show. I just ranted about it for 10 minutes, yet I enjoy it. <br />
I guess trash can still be entertaining.

    If you wondering what episode 12 try to tell you must be like trying to put in all the plot and stories that been happening so far to fully understand what it tries to imply. Episode 12 is like a puzzle that the creator lets you try to find out what it means by yourself. I won&#039;t tell you the answer, the true meaning of the ending cause it will count as a spoiler which I don&#039;t want to do that at all.<br />
<br />
The stories are kinda interesting. Some people will say it like Akira the movie but at the same time, it isn&#039;t. This isn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review273706">
        that kinda movie where they have a superpower like that. The stories will be like about the girl with a fake body try to stop the burst just as the synopsis said but when you watch the entire series it just adds even more than just that. They even use real biological logic in this series too. I will give it 9/10 due to how well made it is and just as the above to what trick it try to do. It explains you and at the same time, it gave you the solvable puzzle for you to solve for later on or it will be solvable in the future. At some point, they also somehow use some strong drama scene without any warning at the right moment too. Not just any BS one but some logical thing that should have to happen. I didn&#039;t even expect they would do a drama that hard without any warning too, to be honest.<br />
<br />
For the art style, its kinda gave you the creep and find it hard to watch but its the whole point. Since this isn&#039;t some happy anime but its the near apocalypse anime. It will be a horrible apocalypse anime if it looks beautiful. Even so, I think they can do better than that by making it, even more, creepier but considering that many horror anime still can&#039;t reach to the point of true horror yet so it&#039;s understandable. I will give it the 8/10.<br />
<br />
For sound effect, I think its only at the good lv. At least it isn&#039;t horrible but only just good so I will give it just 7/10 stand for good and just that.<br />
<br />
For the character design, I will say that it&#039;s kinda fun enjoyable to see how they act and only just that until some episode of course that it somehow made us care about the character. I think this is one of the anime that can do like some instant drama without any warning which is also super effective to how they timing that.<br />
<br />
This anime I find myself very enjoying it. I think it will be 10/10.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, it will be 9+8+7+8+10 = 42 then 42/5 it will be 8.04/10. I will just give it 8/10 due to the math. It isn&#039;t something that you call nonsense. Its what you call &quot;math&quot;<br />
<br />
Extra: To be honest I never expect that Netflix will somehow make a very good original series. This kinda goes beyond what I have to expect in this series. Hope they will make something with this lv of quality a lot more soon. Since most of the series Netflix has a bad hobby of doing the &quot;Must watch more series to know how it will end&quot;<br />
I don&#039;t wang that JoJo reference like &quot;To be continued&quot; memes. Wait... Not another Fing JoJo reference... But yeah that&#039;s how they mostly do so this is considering one of the best they have ever made. There&#039;s a lot more then this but its just so rare but it won&#039;t be if they said this anime is with Netflix without saying that its &quot;Netflix original series&quot; when that happens it always end up really good. With good starting and the good ending that made you want to watch more without being forced to.

    Warning possible Spoilers<br />
<br />
With the success of Devilman Crybaby, there were two new Netflix anime&#039;s to check out B: The Beginning and A.I.C.O.: Incarnation, I decided to watch AICO first and after finishing it I had definitely made the wrong choice.<br />
<br />
Story (5/10)<br />
<br />
The story is set in Japan 2035, where an artificial life form known as Matter has engulfed the Kurobe Gorge. A girl called Aiko lost her family to this and an unknown student says she is the key to stopping the Matter once and for all.<br />
Now AICO&#039;s story was a mixed bag from the get go, in fact after episode 2 I was actually thinking

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275732">
        of dropping it because it was so goddamn boring to watch and the characters weren&#039;t helping either which I&#039;ll get to in a minute. I wanted to be interested in the whole science and story behind the Matter, but the conversations and exposition about this whole thing just kept boring me and I almost lost complete interest in the show completely.<br />
Yet somehow it managed to save itself a little when our group of characters decided to set out on a journey to fight through the Matter to reach the Primary Point, which is where it all started and from episodes 3-8 the show was pretty enjoyable to watch. It had some good action sequences, fairly decent character development and the journey getting through the Matter was pretty thrilling.<br />
Then we reach the final episodes and then everything fell apart, not because it got boring, but because it shoved so much more exposition that it got confusing and kind of annoying to watch as all this new information just suddenly came out of nowhere.<br />
The ending also felt rushed, we get to see like a 1-2 second clip our characters doing things I wasn&#039;t expecting them to do and I feel like they skipped out on having a sadder ending, but nope we gotta have a happy ending for everyone well except for that one guy who ended up dying.<br />
So yeah the story is pretty mixed for me with a poor beginning and end, but a somewhat enjoyable middle section.<br />
<br />
Characters (4/10)<br />
<br />
The characters were easily the weakest part of the whole show, with such a huge cast you&#039;d think that there would be something here amongst them. Surprisingly there was it just wasn&#039;t the main characters.<br />
Aiko and Yuuya are the two main characters of the show and honestly they are so fu*king boring, I gave zero damns about these two as they showed zero personality especially Yuuya, who as a character would&#039;ve been utterly pointless if it wasn&#039;t for the incredibly obvious twist that he was actually someone else. Aiko could&#039;ve been a decent character, but she just didn&#039;t grasp me at all. Yeah she wasn&#039;t exactly human either, but that still didn&#039;t change my perspective of her and in the end I feel like she got off way too easily.<br />
Now the diver crew consisting of Kazuki, Kaede, Yoshihiko and Haruka were definitely the saving grace when it came to the characters. Each if them actually had a kind of personality, it wasn&#039;t amazing, but it was still something and the chemistry between them kept me watching until the final episodes came along and kinda put them in the background and the development choices for them during the last episodes weren&#039;t really great, but they still managed to keep me somewhat entertained.<br />
Of course there is a bunch of other characters, but they were so forgettable that they just aren&#039;t worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
Art (6/10)<br />
<br />
Surprisingly enough for a show as mediocre as this, the artstyle was pretty good. The design of the characters gave me a early-mid 2000&#039;s nostalgic feel and the suits plus the weapons the divers used were actually pretty cool. There was a nice variety of weapons and each of the diver characters had a specific weapon they liked to use which kinda helped to separate them as individuals instead of making them random cannon fodder, also for weapons that exist in the 2030&#039;s they look pretty damn advanced for that time period. The suits did give me a sort of Halo, Mass Effect feel like this what you would get if you combined them and gave them kickass roller skates.<br />
Now despite being CGI the vehicles still looked good especially the giant tank thing they had which kinda sucked to see get destroyed, yet I am kinda surprised the Matter wasn&#039;t CGI, well for the most part it wasn&#039;t, but I have to respect the animators for not making them completely CGI.<br />
One more thing there was one scene where one of the characters was standing on a beach with sticks everywhere and I noticed how detailed that one scene was and it just impressed me to the point where I had to mention it.<br />
<br />
Sound (6/10)<br />
<br />
Also surprisingly the op and ed were fairly decent as well. The op had a alright beat, but it could&#039;ve been better. It&#039;s mainly the ed that caught my eye or ears in this case, because I liked how it showed Aiko walking up the gorge before the incident happened and gave me the feeling this the journey she is going to experience just with a lot of monsters in the way and that it&#039;ll eventually lead her to her goal. The soundtrack was fairly forgettable, but the instrumental notes in some scenes that had some emotion to them were nice to listen to.<br />
The last thing I have to mention and this is what completely killed my ears and brain throughout the whole thing which is the goddamn dub, now usually I&#039;m pretty cut lose with dubs, but there have been a few in the past that I cannot defend them in any way or form because the dub here is absolutely terrible so for once I would actually prefer the sub instead of the dub.<br />
<br />
Extras: <br />
<br />
The action was pretty good and kept me entertained longer than I expected, the fast moving divers going up against an enemy that couldn&#039;t be completely defeated by their guns was kind of intense. But I am a little disappointed that only one character of the group died and it probably would&#039;ve sucked seeing some of the other characters die too, but I felt like having a few extra deaths would&#039;ve helped make the journey a little more emotional and would&#039;ve helped develop the characters a little more.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (5/10)<br />
<br />
Yeah the enjoyment factor was very mixed, one moment I&#039;m hating it, being confused or just bored by it. Another minute there&#039;s a scene that was actually fun to watch and kept me going a little longer.<br />
<br />
Overall (5/10)<br />
<br />
Overall this was like I said a mixed bag of an anime, some people might like it more than I did, but word of advice watch this in sub and not dub (although considering the division between these two fan factions I doubt many will watch it in dub).

    How to NOT make an anime dub 101...<br />
<br />
A.I.C.O.: Incarnation is a very interesting sci-fi anime with a basic plot with some obvious plot twists along the way to make the plot have more bulk. But all things considering, A.I.C.O.: Incarnation is one of the more unique and interesting animes LA had seen yet why does LA feel like LA felt nothing in the process?. <br />
<br />
Anyways the plot revolves around Yuuya Kanzaki wanting to bring Aiko Tachibana over to Primary Point with a select number of Divers (those who handle and purge the Malignant Matter for money, so think of them as mercenary treasure hunters in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285960">
        dangerous environments) helping both Yuuya and Aiko getting to Primary Point. On the surface the plot is a typical escort mission while we learn about Aiko, Yuuya and maybe some of the members of the Divers in the process. What really becomes interesting is once the plot twists comes into play and this doesn&#039;t become a simple &quot;escort mission&quot; more like a science experiment gone haywire and we find out the cause and cure for it with character development mainly focused on Aiko and Yuuya because &quot;main characters&quot; and the such.<br />
<br />
There is a villain in all of this of course by the form of Kyousuke Isazu where his driving conflict with Aiko and Yuuya (but mainly Yuuya) makes Isazu a rather sympathetic but &quot;wrong methods&quot; kind of villain in the process of it. He&#039;s not evil per say as it&#039;s more or less his agenda conflicts heavily with Yuuya and his plans and he will take ANY measures to attain his goal even if his ulterior motives splurges into frame.<br />
<br />
The plot twists were probably the defining things that kept LA interested in what really happened and it&#039;s the plot twists that really catalyzed the plot from mere escort mission to something much more. Now mind you, some of the plot twists were coming from a mile away due all the hints but still the majority of the time, the plot twists helped this anime massively into being almost something great from beginning to end.<br />
<br />
Character-wise well thing is, we do learn much from Aiko being the central character and our audience surrogate along with Yuuya being the one to whisk Aiko and the Divers into the dangerous Primary Point and is the catalyst for the plot to occur thus it&#039;s rather obvious they get the bulk of the screentime and development what with the revelations and everything. The problem goes to the Divers, they are rather stock typical characters, like the genki carefree Kaede to the motherly Maho and the steadfast leader Daisuke but as much as they essentially guardians and protectors to our main characters, they didn&#039;t develop that much as characters and they more or less went with the flow of the plot to define their actions in the plot with little to no backstories about them but considering their mercenaries for hire in a ways LA thinks a backstory wasn&#039;t necessary for two reasons, one they aren&#039;t the main characters and the the plot isn&#039;t focused on the Divers and two, they had more chemistry as a team due to their camaraderie that that was all they really needed and no LA isn&#039;t saying they were dead weight as they did have some impact in the plot in some sense but nonetheless the Diver group weren&#039;t the central focus of the anime at all.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation, done by Bones, well from character designs and the beautiful to fully desecrated places shown was GREAT all things considering. All the characters did have a distinct look to them while the background has either a beautiful look to it but mostly the desecrated look that looks like a science experiment gone wrong-look to it. Since this is Bones, the battles should look awesome right?, well LA will say &#039;decent&quot;  to say the least as most of the battles focus on beam spamming with the damages on the Malignant Matter shown in full force but since there isn&#039;t exactly &quot;fighting&quot; involved, the battle animations are &quot;limited&quot; to say the least. Nonetheless the animation was great, expected form Bones.<br />
<br />
Soooooooooooooooooo...LA watched the English dub for A.I.C.O.: Incarnation (which is why LA didn&#039;t credit the characters VA when it came up as LA usually does) and ohhhh boy if LA&#039;s first statement to this review isn&#039;t saying something well, before LA gets down to the voice work, there&#039;s a bit of stupidit- history to this dub. Well for one, Netflix picked up the anime but instead of handling the dub themselves or to a studio that knows how to do it, Netflix gave a Korean-based media group to handle it in which they gave most of the casting roles to...Spanish dub voice actors who had NEVER done an English dub before...no seriously. The thing is LA won&#039;t blame the voice actors because of this because the main cause was the terrible scripting and directing by newbie to the dubbing field Phil Raeymaekers. How bad is the scripting, well how about to the point they made the translations into English quite literal sounding from using &quot;-chan&quot;, &quot;-san&quot;  and &quot;-kan&quot; into the script instead of going into nicknames or omitting them like most dubs do!, the thing is they weren&#039;t even consistent with it as they yes DO use the honorifics almost all the time but they don&#039;t use it with &quot;sensei&quot; or sometimes were INCONSISTENT in using the honorifics with this, so they couldn&#039;t even get that right. LA was nitpicking there but next thing only gets worse, being the deliveries of ALL the voice cast, again LA doesn&#039;t blame the voice actors because they really weren&#039;t given any proper direction by the director giving us stilted dull monotoned with consistently small pausing performances and with no emotions to ANY of the lines showing it was quite a &quot;literally translated script&quot; and this quite obviously HEAVILY impacted LA watching the anime. LA doesn&#039;t know if felt like LA both was invested in or was up to date with the plot and characters but not WHENEVER any of the characters spoke, LA knew and followed the plot yet didn&#039;t care all at the same time and worse yet have emotionally impactful moments be reduced to dull monotoned performances and this happened VERY often considering the plot LA was talking about. LA thinks some of the worse dubs is when one, your taken off the experience in the world the anime made itself and two, if your invested in the plot and it&#039;s characters yet doesn&#039;t give a crap about what&#039;s happening because the vocal work is soo terrible. Like if LA would have sum up the vocal work it&#039;ll have to be like one of those dubs made TWO DECADES ago but somehow was released in 2018, this isn&#039;t Garzey Wing levels of terrible dubbing but DAMN it&#039;s close. Oh and one more thing is that LA did watch one episode that was in Japanese dubbed and it was fine, LA instantly knew the situation (even though LA already knew it), LA got attached to the characters much faster and LA kept up with the plot. Seriously A.I.C.O.: Incarnation&#039;s dub both taught LA how important voice work is to ANY media as well how NOT to make a Japanese to English dub. Since LA does this for every English dub LA comes across LA awards A.I.C.O.: Incarnation the first E Rank in terms of dubbing because it fricikin&#039; deserves it!, seriously Netflix what in the fuck were you thinking?<br />
<br />
*ahem* A.I.C.O.: Incarnation was one of the more unique sci-fi animes LA seen in 2018 with plot twists weaving together to make a VERY interesting story of a scientist redemption, to right his wrongs. Sure the character department is lacking in some areas and some of the plot twists were kinda foreshadowed and the god awful English dub didn&#039;t help to the point of not even being a &quot;so bad, it&#039;s good&quot; situation, it&#039;s just THAT bad, but all things considered with it&#039;s decent animation done by Bones and especially with the scope of the anime it was going for that for the most part delivered to tell a full story and this being a Bones original is quite something. A.I.C.O.: Incarnation isn&#039;t perfect let alone the &quot;Best Anime of 2018&quot; for LA but it came and gave LA&#039;s expected expectations of what kind of premise and story it had in mind and it delivered.<br />
<br />
Note - If LA watched the Japanese dub instead then the Sound rating would have easily been a 7 or 8 (again aforementioned LA watched at least one episode in Japanese to gauge a comparison to it&#039;s English counterpart)  but LA only gave the Sound a 2 because LA watched the majority of anime in English dub thus LA gave it a 2.

    Character/Story:<br />
The characters in A.I.C.O Incarnation are pretty well written. There are many of them, but they all play off each other well and have decent motivations on what they want to do with their lives. I did particularly like the whole government vs the regular people going into the Burst. This is an old story beat of course, but there are some good ideas behind the specific take on the show and the motivations are done pretty decently as well. They are easy to understand and do demonstrate some character growth and regression (into a bad person) at times. The main character Aiko (or Aico)

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340450">
        however has a few problems. Aiko is a little bit clueless at times. Now this is somewhat acceptable, as she is thrust into a situation that she has no clue how to partake in. But her level of cluelessness is a bit too much and at times, off putting. She constantly suffers from that anime trope of just repeating what characters say or explaining things too far and not letting the viewer come to terms with the scenery or situation. This is probably the biggest hinderance on the series, as the concept of the Burst and idea of how and why it spread is actually quite interesting. I did find enjoyment in the sci-fi aspects of the show, but the main character is extremely hard to root for at times, and her personality is extremely lacking to really dive into who she is and how her existence affects the show as a whole. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The soundscape of the show is a bit lacking. This is partially due to the fact that there aren&#039;t many memorable tracks besides the opening and ending. This is fine, as there are a lot of shows like this, but for this show specifically, the extra feeling that could have been achieved from this soundscape would have addd so much more to the idea of dread and looming from the Burst. The opening is very well made, and the song is nice and reflective of the anime as a whole. The ending is one of those reflective pieces that rather than juxtapose, it helps to remind you of what you&#039;re watching and the motivations and end goal of the characters. The ambient sounds and incidental music do help to make the feeling more real, but they would have been largely benefited from actual reoccurring tracks, than just sounds and small ambient music that dots the score. The sound design is pretty good, with some believable sounds for the mechs as well as the Burst having some nice &quot;goo-like&quot; sounds that help to show how the Burst would sound to the characters as well.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art style is interesting. Its extremely cliched and does require some work, but stuff like the Burst are animated pretty well and do convey the venom-like nature of the disease. The movement of the mechs are pretty well done, but their use of CGI is a bit smooth. The characters have some good animation where the emotional drama and tensions are at highs, which helps to drive the scene or action as important, but scenes where there aren&#039;t many actions taking place, or are there for character development aren&#039;t being fully utilized by the animation team and just seem lackluster and out of place compared to the heavy action scenes in terms of animation. The art style is also an interesting one too, in which the anime falls victim to the &quot;redness&quot; when it comes to the joints of Aiko. This is a bit annoying to look at, as it is quite bright in this show and does clash with the dark muted colors of the rest of the show.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
A.I.C.O Incarnation is a pretty decent sci-fi action show that can be emotional at times. There are some good and bad parts to it. Honestly, the best way to watch the show is probably by foregoing any huge emotional ideas one would get from the show, and just watch it for fun. It is a good show to watch with friends and just enjoy, but when thinking more deeply about it, its flaws certainly show.

    For an original series by Netflix, I admittedly went in with no expectations. I was simply looking for something short to watch on Netflix and happened to stumble upon it without much clue of what it was about. Nevertheless, I was interested after the first three episodes and ended up binge watching the rest in one go. <br />
<br />
The beginning opens up with not a lot of explanation and left me quite confused, but as the story progressed, I found that they explained details at around the right timing to drive the story. The characters are a bit dull in my opinion, but I liked the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309788">
        development of the MC in the end. I&#039;d say it is a bit predictable though- I was able to pinpoint certain key points mid-series, but I still watched the whole thing just to make sure I was correct.<br />
<br />
As someone who loves sci-fi and more &quot;scientific&quot; anime, this definitely hit all my check boxes for a simple binge watching afternoon when you have nothing better to do. 7/10

    Episode 1 is good, and really served to pique my interest.<br />
<br />
The Divers are given an exciting opening, and Aiko&#039;s slice-of-life intro works pretty well at giving us a sense of her character and some of her immediate life struggles.  Some genuine mystique is built up around the Matter and its&#039; role in the world, and the pacing works well.<br />
<br />
After that, though, I think my final impression of the series gradually turned into something a little above average at best.<br />
<br />
There are some solid parts to the series overall.  The mechanical designs of the vehicles are pretty good and are well-animated CG, and there was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review273744">
        some nice effects work on the synthetic suits and other technological elements.  They also picked really fun intro and outro songs, I enjoyed those a lot.<br />
<br />
For a while, I watched with the impression that the story was going to turn into something interesting, and say something I hadn&#039;t heard on the subject of human-machine coexistence.  The setup of the Matter, artificial organisms, and the emphasis on medical technology and life-saving surgeries seemed novel in its&#039; treatment, at least at first.  But all the payoffs fell short of my expectations, and the story gradually unfolded into a much sloppier and more generic take on the subject.<br />
<br />
There are three big problems with the storytelling in this show.  <br />
<br />
One is the confused morality it attempts to use throughout when talking about the moral rights (or lack thereof) of synthetic beings, which feels more pedantic and poorly defined the more the story tries to explore it in any depth.  This is most clearly seen in Yuuya&#039;s character, especially in the latter half of the series, and the main justification for his disregard for the rights of artificial life seems to be the fact that he&#039;s a smart cookie scientist so shut up.  Conversely, anyone arguing for the intrinsic value of said artificial life exclusively does so through the &quot;but I like them and my feelings are real so they must be real too&quot; empathic argument, which, again, is sloppy and unsatisfying.  So it strikes out on both counts, in my opinion.  In the end we *mostly* get the lazy light/dark bio/artificial we-cannot-mingle apartheid mentality, which was just a disappointment.<br />
<br />
The second is the way the story executes its&#039; attempts at thrilling twists, which often *almost* succeed, but which either rely on narrative ass-pulls, or - in one very important case - confuse things to the point of near contradiction, only to be (mostly?) patched by borderline retroactive storytelling (e.g. Aiko&#039;s eyes; you&#039;ll know it when you see it).  The result is that there is no point where these twists directly build off a past hint or event without introducing outright new information that was previously hidden from the viewer, and impossible to obtain beforehand.  The result is that I basically shrug and throw my hands in the air whenever it happens - because how am I supposed to even try to predict a twist that only the writer can see coming?  (This is a classic mistake in bad mystery story writing.  The reader should *always* be given just enough information to figure out who killed who with what and when, IF they care to put in the effort before reading what the protagonist detective thinks.  That&#039;s part of the fun.  There&#039;s no point to this, however, if it turns out that the real killer escapes all detection by everybody until the final act, and only appears at the very end, impossible to predict beforehand.  That&#039;s not a mystery; that&#039;s a joke.  Or cell assembler #3.)<br />
<br />
The third is the fleshing-out of the technology.  Most of the story is grounded in the concept of the &quot;cell assemblers&quot;, which are basically synthetic biological cells which mimic their biological counterparts.  At first, things seem to tick along pretty well in the story.  The most outlandish thing we see is the &quot;Matter&quot;, the uncontrolled bio-hazard which coats a good chunk of the local landscape; but it behaves in ways that seem plausible despite its&#039; alien and uncontrolled mystique.  However, as the story progresses, things become increasingly murky in terms of how things work or what we can even expect to be possible, and the show dabbles in random telepathy and spontaneous clairvoyance that have NO clear or even attempted explanation other than &quot;synthetic biology did it.  somehow.&quot;.  This means that the stakes and the dramatic tension become increasingly murky as well.  And that&#039;s half the story right there, really.  I think the most blatant example of this is the entire subplot for Isazu and his daughter, especially right near the end.  What starts as a tragic bond between father and daughter becomes an increasingly scattered and cluttered mess of a dramatic subplot that really comes out of left field, culminating in some borderline nonsensical biotech megalomania that feels awkward and shoehorned in.  (In fact, a lot of the final conflicts in the last four episodes feel awkwardly bolted-on in this way, rather than clear logical extensions of what came before.)<br />
<br />
Aside from those glaring issues, the action scenes were decent overall despite an occasional choppy shot, but I will admit that endless scenes of relatively samey Matter attacks did start to get old sooner rather than later.  The voice work was decent, no real complaints there.  The setting art was a bit on the darker and more unstimulating side, but I think it was serviceable.<br />
<br />
One general complaint is that there wasn&#039;t much character development after episode 4 or so.  Most of the characters don&#039;t really grow or change in significant ways, and most of their interactions are either cocky battle chatter or scared yelling, without much depth or insight into who they are or why they live the lives they do (aside from one rather awkwardly blatant scene on an outpost rooftop...).  As well, for all the screentime Nanbara gets, I didn&#039;t really feel like her character contributed much to the story other than some occasional narrative convenience and a halfhearted take on political intrigue.  Her stance on why the matter shouldn&#039;t be destroyed, which is practically her defining character trait, is never really clarified or challenged in any depth, and becomes moot to the story except as a means to buy time for other characters later in the story.  She could have either been made more relevant, or cut near entirely.<br />
<br />
The scenes that aren&#039;t mostly banter or battle cries are fine where the story manages to keep itself coherent and on the rails.  But Aiko is a mostly passive and reactive protagonist who is literally shuttled through the story from start to end, and this is a serious problem in itself when most of the story is centered around her point of view.  Many of the action scenes don&#039;t even involve her all that much, other than to show that she still exists and is struggling with the situation.  The only active decision(s) she makes after episode 2 is to keep going on this field trip in the first place, but her only real strengths are that she&#039;s a nice person and has a high pain tolerance.  That&#039;s about it.<br />
<br />
In short, this show initially seemed to offer something fresh, but ultimately fails to deliver on that impression.  If you want a half-decent scifi action show to burn through one afternoon, this is fine for that, but I don&#039;t specifically recommend it beyond the first or second episode.  Skim through it if you want to see more of the tank and vehicle designs though, they&#039;re pretty fun to watch as they scoot around.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading.

    Overall this is one of those animes I watched not because it was amazing or anything, rather it was ok. <br />
<br />
Lets start with how the anime actually looked to me. For character design there really wasn&#039;t anything special. For Kanzaki lookwise reminded me greatly of Inaho Kaizuka from Aldnoah Zero and will definitely blend in to generic anime characters in my memory. I think the diver suits with the different splashes of color were the most notable outfit of the show.<br />
<br />
The enemy in this show, the &quot;matter&quot;, isn&#039;t anything to write home about either think along the fleshy blob that Tetsuo became in Akira .

          <span style="display: none;" id="review273617">
        Honestly the first couple episodes before the characters venture outside the safety of the city is probably where the setting looked best. Afterwards most scenery is either blocked out by the matter&#039;s ability to produce mist or takes place within a research facility. The colors used often seemed dreary and bleak to me as well, and it was so rarely changed that it eventually felt visually boring to me. Also the repeated use of Aiko&#039;s memories throughout the show were a bit apparent as well to me. It never looked exactly bad, but none of it was exceptional or memorable either.  <br />
<br />
The story of this anime falls slightly to the better side. Thematically the focus seemed explore is there a difference between humans and clones of humans if they retain the same ability to feel and make decisions. The politics of the show between the organization responsible for dealing with the artificial organisms (the name escapes me) and the state government was able to interest me as well. There ideals of taking any means to progress your nation face off against respecting human lives. Automatic bonus points are applied too just for having a satisfying conclusion to the show, I&#039;ve watched too many animes lately that finish the season never to be seen from again. The show leaves enough clues lying around where some of the &quot;twists&quot; were fairly predictable which isn&#039;t a mark against it. Enjoyment can still be had when the anticipations you have are met by the show. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ll eventually get better at writing about sound track but I definitely enjoyed the opening and ending.<br />
<br />
Finally I&#039;ll just lightly touch on the characters. For only 12 episodes it would be a very hard task to have deep characterization for the entire cast. Unsurprisingly many of the supporting characters don&#039;t get to shine at all. We definitely get to see the conflicts and growth of the main two, Aiko and Kanzaki which I personally thought was well done. Specifically Kanzaki&#039;s realization of what he initially started out to do and his inability to accomplish this was well done. We get to see minor character growth in Kaede and Kazuki, but really any characters outside of Aiko and Kanzaki are still underdeveloped imo. <br />
<br />
6/10 score - Nothing revolutionary thematically, but it presents its thoughts well. Visually the quality was alright but I personally thought it was bleak and thus boring throughout the show. Plot was fine, enjoyed the main characters but side characters weren&#039;t shown much love. Fine to watch if you don&#039;t have anything better to do<br />
<br />
If you made it this far into the review I hope you found it helpful, over time I hope I&#039;ll be better at giving insight into shows while also not having this read as a generic essay.

    One thing you cannot take away from A.I.C.O and is worth witnessing even if you don&#039;t make through the entire show, is the artwork. It&#039;s superb, horrific, fascinating, creative, disgusting, and definitely a direction that is rarely pursued. They start and end strongly in this area, and if you are a fan of animation and art in general this show is worth the watch for the visuals alone. With that said, **SPOILERS** ahead.<br />
<br />
What makes the artwork great is &quot;The Matter&quot;. What the hell is The Matter? It&#039;s basically a &quot;grey goo&quot;, but based on multi-cellular organisms and how they form structures at the cellular level.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review423186">
        In the dangerous zone The Matter occupies, it is absolutely everywhere, convering absolutely everything. More than that, it is capable of forming all kinds of disgusting structures and traps to impale, engulf, decapitate and/or smash to smitherines any organism or vehicle containing life forms that it encounters within it&#039;s territory. If you&#039;ve seen the horror film Life, this is basically what you could expect the monster to turn into for the sequel, &quot;Life 2: Red Dead Earth&quot;. It&#039;s terrifying and super fresh.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I feel a bit let down with the initially promising journey into the matter-infested zone by the &quot;divers&quot; and the somewhat mysterious Aico. There was so much opportunity with this setting, with this cast of characters - so much to explore. But in the end, I could not help but feel that despite the very competent production team and excellent ingredients, and the undeniable artistic achievement in animating the unique countermeasures of the divers against the matter and the matter&#039;s relentless and horrific hostility towards the divers - there just wasn&#039;t a very compelling narrative to go along with the stunning presentation. Both the political intrigue and secret power games angle that revolves around the origins of The Matter and the value of it and Aico as specimes of artificial life, and the journey of Aico and the divers into the heart of The Matter fell flat and failed to tie into each other despite the efforts of the writers. Instead of the smart, ruthless nature of characters with competing aims making for interesting interactions, double-crosses, and outplays - it just kind of devolves into a power of friendship, oh look the bad guy has gone mad, wow made it just in time kind of thing... somehow they let this of all things get boring. I suspect they were playing it safe, and it really left huge cavity in the story and characters department that no amount of ingenious artwork was going to make up for.<br />
<br />
Now, on balance this isn&#039;t really a bad show. There&#039;s more to like about this probably, and it is at least more consistent and more ambitious with better production values and pacing, than other shows I&#039;ve given higher ratings. However, as a whole the drag in the story and characters department is so significant towards the end that it becomes hard to pay attention to anything but the visuals - and that&#039;s a disaster for this show because the visuals play off of the tense &quot;horror&quot; element. With no investment in the characters, or their situation, it&#039;s very hard to do anything but shrug when they are trying to fend off The Matter.<br />
<br />
Another gripe I have is that they really left no opening for a follow-up or spin-off. I think that would have been appropriate here - why does The Matter have to die? Unfortunately, this is a one and done and it wasn&#039;t done right. Still, it&#039;s a very watchable and very well drawn work that I recommend despite my criticism of it. I&#039;m just upset that it didn&#039;t end up sticking the landing, because it really could have been great.

    A.I.C.O is, to summarize, very mediocre. The plot, focusing around a teenage girl who we&#039;re supposed to assume is &quot;normal&quot; is broken fairly quickly, though I wish there would have been more preamble before that point. The story only gives you what you need to know<br />
right as it becomes important - there was a major &#039;plot twist&#039; later on that might&#039;ve had an effect if I&#039;d actually known what was going on with the characters.<br />
<br />
However, A.I.C.O makes up for a lot of its flaws with killer worldbuilding and art - the &#039;Matter&#039; has taken over part of Japan and ravenously devours anything that enters its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314356">
        domain. This is the first thing we&#039;re exposed to in the first episode, and it&#039;s great. The main plot, without revealing much (though, it&#039;s not like revealing it would even be much of a pain, it&#039;s pretty much exposed from episode one) has our cast of characters going deep in to the domain of the &#039;Matter&#039;. It&#039;s a very good core concept, and the landscapes it portrays are quite amazing, hence the &#039;eight&#039; in art.<br />
<br />
To be honest, if you care about character in this kind of story, you won&#039;t enjoy it, but I had a good time just due to the spectacle and the quality of the combat. It&#039;s fairly unique compared to many other shows I&#039;ve seen, and giving it a shot would be a good idea if it seems interesting to you.

    This anime is not breaking any records and ultimately it doesn&#039;t really have anything in particular to say.<br />
<br />
However, it is a fun sci fi adventure with some interesting characters and technology, and the animation is quite good. Also, there are lots of women in non-demeaning roles and the main character is a girl as well. <br />
<br />
As usual with anime sci fi don&#039;t try to look at the &#039;science&#039; aspect of it too hard, but if I were to hold that against it I would never be able to watch a sci fi anime. (there&#039;s never been one that was based on anything close to reality).

          <span style="display: none;" id="review276989">
        <br />
<br />
I binge watched this on a saturday afternoon when I was stuck in bed with back pain, and I suspect this is the ideal kind of situation for watching these 12 episode netflix anime.  They&#039;re like very long movies rather than actual series.  As such, characterization is what they can fit into 12 eps, plot is what they can fit into 12 eps, etc. <br />
<br />
Okay so, pros and cons:<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
-Great animation<br />
-Great music (so rare now)<br />
-Interesting tech and biotec<br />
-Lots of good female characters<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
-Very weird male protagonist who is ultimately lacking in personality<br />
-Story is a bit simple and by-the-numbers<br />
-Some plot elements are never really explained<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
A nice weekend binge watch if you really like sci fi with biotec, and aren&#039;t opposed to a story with a lot of female main characters.

    The story was well thought out, with interesting plot twists. The characters were likable, but something was off. This anime never clicked with me. Possibly the fact that it was &#039;story telling by info dump&#039;: way too much exposition.<br />
<br />
This anime was very dense in information. I had to pause the episodes periodically to try to process what was going on, and who was who and why they were doing what they did.<br />
<br />
the action was plot driven - you aren&#039;t going to see epic battles. Instead the fights are just there to help with the story. I usually like that, but it would have been nice

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274626">
        to see the characters win through some special perseverance or creativity.<br />
<br />
The art and the sound a decent<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall, I would say give this show a try if you have nothing better to watch.

    Spare yourself some second-hand embarrassment by watching this with it&#039;s original Japanese audio and subtitles. Seriously. The English dubbing is awful; near-excruciating. Nothing dumbs down an otherwise decent anime like the use of Japanese suffixes in English speech. Translate in full, or not at all. I couldn&#039;t even make it through two episodes before adjusting my audio/subtitle settings.<br />
<br />
That said, it&#039;s worth the watch in its intended format. Nothing special, but I enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
<br />

... The character minimum for these reviews is ridiculous. Some things can be said in less words. Below is some nonsense to help me reach my count:<br />

    Seeing all that meat move around so quick made me uncomfortable...<br />
<br />
The english voice actor for the main girl annoyed me at times and the pacing seemed to fast (like every netflix anime i&#039;ve seen). The art and lighting was solid (like every netflix anime i&#039;ve seen) and the soundtrack was ok nothing to special. Netflix has been real hit and miss with there anime, I think in a few years they&#039;ll figure it out more but until then we&#039;ll probably keep getting these iffy shows. Couldn&#039;t say i&#039;d recomend this to most people unless they were into power rangers with a side of raw blood

    I thoroughly enjoyed this series from start to finish.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack was amazing at building up scenes and I will definitely download it. <br />
<br />
The characters were lovable each with interesting characteristics to keep the series fresh. In particular I think Aiko and Kanazki were great characters and kept me engaged in the story.<br />
<br />
I loved the its apocalyptic virus outbreak setting which I hadn&#039;t seen in a while and its done perfectly here with its unique Burst. If your a fan of these types of anime you&#039;ll love A.I.C.O.<br />
<br />
This series is one of the most interesting and enjoyable series I have watched in a while alongside its

    This anime boasts one of THE BIGGEST SIMPS IN ANIME HISTORY. I absolutely cannot stand the sight of this character. If you watched it, you know who I&#039;m talking about. Anyways, the anime itself is okay. Maybe could&#039;ve been better without the worthless simp.<br />
<br />
Story was interesting enough to keep me watching. It wasn&#039;t exhilarating or anything. There was one big plot twist that I think was pretty good.<br />
<br />
Sound design was good, but the soundtrack was pretty limited.<br />
<br />
Art was pretty good, no complaints. Didn&#039;t look gimmicky, but it also didn&#039;t look super high production value.<br />
<br />
Characters were okay, but obviously weren&#039;t too deep, especially given that it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review393243">
        was only a 12 episode series. But again, the simp made everything so much worse. Stop simping.

    I watched the first 3 episodes in regular speed and I watched it in 4x speed for the rest, just to finish the series before definitively saying that the show is garbage.<br />
<br />
What&#039;s good about this show? I struggle to say. Perhaps the animation is pretty decent quality, and no bad CGI was used for the monsters, but it was actually well animated.<br />
<br />
Other than that, nothing. This show is one where the story is just rushing past everything at a breakneck pace in order to cram enough plot to get to the conclusion. What I mean is that you&#039;re given info dumps left and right, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review385975">
        random characters you don&#039;t know very well and never will know very well will be pulling the plot forward. You never really get to understand much of the combat, nor does the show care. There&#039;s no relevant development of any characters. Rather, they just &quot;brave it through&quot; and &quot;gain a new sense of motivation&quot; without much rhyme or reason. Basically, our main character is just dragged along with peoples&#039; agenda for the large majority of the show, and doesn&#039;t have much motivation themself. You never really get to know any characters particularly well, other than the ones where they shove flashbacks in order to artificially make you think more of a random stranger that&#039;s dying, doing something reckless, or going against the main character and her comrades. Our main character is merely taken for the ride because she&#039;s an important object, a &quot;key&quot; and that&#039;s exactly how she functions for the entire story. She&#039;s a mere ornament to the characters that are carrying her to &quot;ground zero&quot; and any involvement of her being useful is due to the plot thinking that she can&#039;t literally be a useless sack of garbage for the entire show. She somehow goes through a transformation in character and gains a new sense of hope and drive to save the world within the few minutes of character development allotted to her. She then becomes magically useful and mentally resilient in the short period in around 5 minutes. Her comrades that are going with her to ground zero? Absolutely nothing about them is revealed, and only surface parts of their personality are ever revealed, but guess what, I&#039;m supposed to care when one of them dies, or when one of them falls in love with Aico. What&#039;s the reason for them to be risking their lives in the first place? What&#039;s their determination? It&#039;s never explained really.<br />
What about the action packed adventure towards the goal that Aico and her team are doing? Surely the fighting is amazing. Yeah, well I can&#039;t say much about the choreography: its pretty decent, it&#039;s just that it&#039;s just them fighting tentacle monsters over and over again, with them deploying a &quot;kill gate&quot; at the end of each area. This gets repeated 4-5 times, with minor changes in the enemy. Was it really necessary for there to be so many repetitive sequences other than to waste screen time that desperately needed to be reallocated to something more important? Plus, the extremely slow paced dialogue that reveals little to nothing and the side arc with Yuzuha are just extremely painful to sit through even at 4x speed. Was it necessary for there to be so many parallel stories going at once when they couldn&#039;t even get the &quot;main story&quot; done well? There&#039;s a reason why this show is 12 episodes, rushes past so much plot, yet does so little with any interest with making characters have any development or personality.<br />
<br />
And For what exactly? What exactly is the plot rushing for? Nothing amazing, let me tell you. The overarching plot isn&#039;t that complicated, the story is just focused on the wrong things. Repetitive action scenes, Yuzuha/side arcs/random dialogue/repeated flashbacks take up an extremely large portion of the story when there should have been more worldbuilding onto what exactly the matter is,  what divers do, and how they adapt to different situations. It would have been so much better if there were separate story arcs rather than a single, long, boring and convoluted story arc that goes from 0-100. There&#039;s no introductory arc that really needed to happen. There really needed to be more time for Aico to adapt to the circumstances and rather than just have a billion info dumps, have natural way of producing information to Aico and make it more of a linear and slow paced  story. Not just Aico, but also know more about the divers that accompany Aico, and that would have neatly tied in with the objective of learning what Divers do. There was a 3 minute scene at the very beginning that showcases that, but it needed to be much more than 3 minutes. <br />
