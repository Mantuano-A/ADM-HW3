    Do you remember the time when your favorite toy or video game got taken away and you raged on for hours without it for the day? That’s how I felt after watching this show. But even after taking away that favorite toy or game, you can get it back, well most of the time anyways. However, the precious time you might try to invest into this anime will be lost forever if you’re not careful. And for a series like this, every minute watching this show equivalents to a massive amount of brain cells lost to such a catastrophe.<br />
<br />
For starters, the series is directed by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review143535">
        Tetsuya Yanagisawa known recently for his work in High School DxD. But unlike that show, Diamidaler the Sound Robot (as the name implies) adds the addition of mecha to its story. And speaking of story, we have main male protagonist Kouichi Madanbashi who possesses Hi-ERo particles in order to fight off a force known as the evil Penguin Empire. Here’s where things gets wacky as the antagonist takes the form of penguins with dick-cannons. As subtle this all seems like, the show attempts to take itself seriously because Kouichi’s abilities to power the mecha known as Daimidaler is the only source known to fight them. The catch is how he is able to power them: by groping the boobs of females. <br />
<br />
After watching each episode, I feel like I need a time machine to get back the time I lost. There’s little substance to the story as the series tries desperately to grab viewers’ attention from all the wrong angles. Although there are similar series with generic attributes, this show doesn’t know what to do with itself. For example, we have penguins with dick-cannons that tries to take over the world for reasons of just because. This comes out as completely tasteless as the antagonist lacks motivation. Neither does this work for the way they are designed with their dick-shaped cannons and penguin framework. How can anyone take this seriously? Oh wait, Kouichi does since he has to fight them with his powers. Unfortunately, he is a man with a perverted attitude and an egoistic behavior.  To him, fighting these penguins is guilty pleasure because he gets the opportunity to grope breasts. And really, the show doesn’t even try to hide this even for a damn second.<br />
<br />
Kouichi ’s power requires him to grope breasts so naturally that resource comes from female characters such as Kyoko Sonan. The two are incompatible as a duo as Kyoko sees Kouichi as nothing more than a pervert. The latter enjoys Kyoko’s company as she fuels his lust with every battle. But the catch is that Kyoko plays along and even seems to develop some innate feelings for Kouichi . Whether this is romantic or not is downplayed because every angle of the camera focuses on the breasts rather than Kyoko’s real feelings. In other words, the romance of this series is obliterated by any sense of connectivity. There’s no real relationship, whether short-term or long-term. What there is though is the asinine partnership between Kouichi and Kyoko that transits into an abyss of twisted humor. <br />
<br />
As humor comes, the show intentionally poked at fun or at least tries to make a parody out of mecha. The problem is the execution because it’s too desperate. The fan service never fades away for even a moment whether it’s be the dick shaped cannons, breast groping, suggestive camera angles, or just plain nudity in sight. Even the story itself suffers through its exhibitionist ideas as the antagonist experiments with their plans. In the end, it creates senseless humor that tries to explicate its half-assed story. It doesn’t help with its cast of one dimensional characters and second rated mecha designs. Clearly, the action lacks attention because most of it is focuses on the groans and breast groping. At the same time, the mecha are just a mute compared to what the show is trying to demonstrate – a show of destructive shock values aimed to entertain from all the wrong angles at whatever audience it was intended for.<br />
<br />
Artwork features several problems in particular with the generic character designs. The fan service is no stranger to this series already but the mecha design has some bits of credibility to it. Unfortunately, the designs are cheesy with nothing distinctive to write home about. In a way, the dick-cannons can also be disturbing if you’ve visited a zoo in the past before with an appreciation of penguins. Animation studio TNK adapts this show and they really dropped the ball on this big time. There’s nothing worth of praise or sympathy to give to this show. The mecha designs are just laughable in the wrong way.<br />
<br />
At first glance, soundtrack might be the last factor to save this show. Unfortunately, it doesn’t because the groaning will take most of the background noise away; when Kouichi does his mojo of course. The OST has little value of importance since the show mostly focuses on how Kouichi enjoys his guilty pleasure. At the same time, character voices comes out as cheesy. Kouichi’s voice sounds arrogant and full of narcissism. On the other hand, we have Kyoko with a role of maiden in distress. Of course, her voice matches that style perfectly when she screams in both pain and pleasure when Kouichi gathers his power. That’s not a compliment since it’s hard to depict exactly what kind of character she is based off her voice mannerism alone. At the same time, the OP and ED songs tries some diehard attempt to replicate old school style of choreography. However, the result is the unbecoming of a cherishing work although I admit that the OP song does has a catchy tone.<br />
<br />
This review didn’t take long to write and neither will I remember the show for any longer than the time I spent writing it. But I do have to give the show some credit for being gusty enough to try their concept. It’s energetic and makes me smile for all the wrong reasons. The mindless entertainment that I got out from this show is easily forgettable thanks to the overall attributes of this series. It’s not just the attempt to go with the story, characters, premise, narrative, or whatever the show is trying to do. It’s more about trying to attract attention to an audience in all the wrong ways. Watching this show in the end is like the Stock Market crash of 1929. The crash and burn is absolutely devastating. <br />

Kenzen Robo Daimidaler is a parody/satire of the mecha genre. Not only that it makes fun of a lot of other(mostly older) anime/shows.  <br />
The story is about a species invading earth and a hero who is suddenly made to pilot a giant robot ( now, where have I heard this before?) to defeat them. The invaders are not your usual ones, they are humanoid penguins. The usual driving force to defeat your enemies should be willpower, willpower that makes your robot stronger (makes sense I know). Instead of willpower Daimidaler powers up by &quot;ero energy /ero power&quot; that is produced by the perverted pilot.If

          <span style="display: none;" id="review177547">
        you didn&#039;t get it by now ero power is used to make fun of the willpower powerups which are really absurd when you think about it. Daimidaler uses a lot of parodies like this, that&#039;s why the show will most likely appeal to only those who will get the references. <br />
<br />
The show can be divided in 2 parts. The first part is the strongest one, it has manly characters that make the show full of energy and has an epic conclusion that glues the viewer to the chair. The second part is weaker and annoying. Even if it is intended to be that way it does ruin the enjoyment a little. Among all parodies there is even a ton of fanservice, and by fanservice I mean fully exposed breasts, no censure nipples included. The reason behind that is simply: why not!? It is not a show you are supposed to take seriously in the first place so why not add some spice to it. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack is quite good, especially the opening which screams GAR from every note, simply amazing and fits the show really well.<br />
The animation is ok, nothing special about it, but fits this type of show well, so is the art. The robot desings are stupid and absurd, but that is the point.(even if Daimidaler does look badass at momnets). Character expressions, funny and erotic are well presented. <br />
<br />
Characters are what makes this show what it is. The hilarious perverted penguins, their perverted penguin lover girl, the badass perverted main character and the other ones are well presented.<br />
<br />
The second part characters are annoying and you want to hit them in the face, but again that&#039;s the whole point since even the characters in the show point out how annoying they are. They are actually a good way to show how romance in fiction can be annoying and cringy.<br />
<br />
The other characters worth pointing out are the professors girls (aka fanserice material) and the comander. The comander appears like that overpowered all knowing badass character (ex. Gendo Ikari). <br />
As mentioned in the introduction this show will be most likely enjoyed by older anime fans who will get the multiple references/parodies. As for myself I enjoyed the show a lot. Aside from the parody and satire there isn&#039;t much to this show. Well there is the GAR factor and of course boobs. Since I like all of that my enjoyment score is 9.5/10 <br />
<br />
With this I think I mentioned everything that must be mentioned....maybe even too much...it&#039;s a damn parody don&#039;t expect something else. <br />
A real gem among all those tryhard pretentious fanservice shows, daimidaler stays true to itself until the end. <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading.

    There&#039;s only one way to put this : This show is stupid and proud of it!<br />
<br />
To get this anime you have to understand the self-parody going on.  If you don&#039;t watch a lot of anime or get anime culture then you won&#039;t really appreciate this show.<br />
<br />
The show revolves around a giant robot called daimidaler a robot that&#039;s uses erotic particles to move and perform attacks vs the evil erotic machines of the penguin empire.  This show is a homage to all the anime tropes:  Harem, ecchi, giant robots combined into one.  The entire show is an excuse for the director and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175341">
        voice actors to let their hair down and just take it to the absurd!  If you like watching stupid sex jokes, over the top orgasm voice acting and silly robot action then this anime is up your ally.

<br />
If you thought this was spam, then you&#039;re wrong. This is not just spam, this is Daimidaler-level spam. <br />
<br />
Daimidaler is the essence of insanity and craziness. With robots powered by perversion and &#039;penguins&#039; with front &#039;tails&#039;, Daimidaler was a show that made me laugh and think about what the hell I just watched.<br />
<br />
Every Saturday morning, when I wake up, Daimidaler is up and subbed on plenty of anime sites. So, the first thing I do in my day is get a dose of triple mindfuck and laughability. Daimidaler always makes my day, especialy the penguin scenes.<br />
<br />
&#039;That&#039;s right. If one reads another&#039;s porno magazines, one must return them properly.&quot;<br />
-Penguin Empire<br />
<br />
So, let me get straight to the review.<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
Daimidaler doesn&#039;t have much of a story. All of it is about humans, penguins, robots and porn magazines. It&#039;s entertaining as fuck, but there&#039;s not much of a plot.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
Even though the art looks pretty old, it matches Daimidaler&#039;s theme and atmosphere. All I have to say is, the mechas. They look awful, which makes this show even funnier. I mean, even the MC gets annoyed by that one puny arm that the Daimidaler has. Overall, the art is pretty funny.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
The OSTs and the sound effects were pretty run-of-the-mill, but the OP is what makes this good. Kenzen Robo Daimidaler, sung by Endohkai, is sorta old-styled like the art. But, on the other hand, it&#039;s catchy as hell and is a song that makes this show enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
The first MC and his girl -ahem, toy- are one of the highlights of this show. Mandanbashi Kouichi is the most perverted and crazy high schooler that i&#039;ve ever seen (besides Issei), which makes him funny to watch as he abuses Kyouko inside the Daimidaler for Hi-ERO Particles, which I like to call High-on-drugs-Erotic Particles. Ritz was also funny as hell to watch, and the Penguin Empire was probably the thing that got me to give all this a nine. Only bad character in this show was Souma.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
Like a said before, this show is like weed. It makes you high and is insanely enjoyable. I laugh like crazy everytime Kouichi or the Penguin Empire has a scene.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
If you like crazy and nonsensical anime, then you will love this show. If you hate these types of show, go away or the penguin empire will attack you with their front-tail cannons. This show is drugs and epicness combined together.<br />
<br />
Watch Daimidaler and see for yourself. You&#039;ll either drop it in the first five minutes or watch all the way, laughing.

    This is the first review I&#039;ve ever written for a show so please bear with me.<br />
<br />
This is one of my most favorite anime of the spring season. This was something that really enjoyed watching and could not wait for the next episode. <br />
<br />
If you watch this expecting to have a really well and thought out story, then this probably isn&#039;t for you. It a show that you can just have fun watching and enjoy yourself. There have been moment where I&#039;ve laughed so heard, I began to tear up because this show is so ridiculous.<br />
<br />
When thinking about this show, you should definitely think of it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review148039">
        as a comedy and expect a lot of ecchie moments!<br />
<br />
If you enjoy ecchie, you will not be disappointed with this anime!

    I think this will be the first positive review, well..... 50-50%.<br />
<br />
Borderline hentai, I mean erotic jokes, thoughts, acts.... like the God Scrub, the Guilliver&#039;s..... oh come on. <br />
<br />
This tv series could pass as a hentai ova let alone.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s just say younger sibling of Highschool DXD, very similar in many ways but only one major difference.... this one have giant robots &amp; deals with a invasion of a race of humaniod penguin aliens whose tail is facing front making a image of a penis.<br />
<br />
I can take the tail penis (episode 4 where a design of the tail was actually at the back rear end seemed right

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195139">
        to me but wrong for the penguin emperor)<br />
<br />
but looking at Kouichi&#039;s Diamidaler.... like a low cost budget unfinished robot being made out of different parts of different robots ala, Frankinstien but in robot form or like a puppet-like enemy robot stolen by humans for thier own use. Gives me the goosebumps.... the eyes, the hair..... looks scary.<br />
<br />
Oh, Kiriko&#039;s mecha&#039;s looks more cooler and more mecha-like than Diamidaler with more muscle I mean metal. But Kiriko&#039;s type 6 diamidaler have a huge mantis tail-like at its rear side that turns out to be a weapon consisting the ridiculus overly large arm &amp; the shoulder panels.<br />
robots&#039;s face switched into the creepy eyes..... and its hair grew longer!<br />
<br />
Oh, Kouichi&#039;s Diamidaler&#039;s right arm looks like it lack more muscle I mean metal..... useless piece of stick turns out to be a high powered canon/gun.<br />
<br />
Diamidaler mechas may have also patterned paying homeage thier left arm from the U.S. animated comic franchise..... Hellboy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here are my cast comparisons: It up to you to figure out the similarities &amp; not<br />
<br />
DIAMIDALER - HIGHSCHOOL DXD<br />
<br />
1. Kouichi Madanbashi &amp; Issei Hyoudou (special mention, Kyouichi could pass as Issei&#039;s older relative cousin or brother.... don&#039;t you think?)<br />
<br />
2. Kyouko Sonan &amp; Rias Gremory <br />
<br />
3. Kyouko Sonan &amp; Raynare<br />
<br />
4. Rikantz Seaberry &amp; Asia Argent (Ritz&#039;s an orphand, some what self-obssessed, infatuated to penguins she betrays mankind..... talk about self brainwashed sold her body &amp; soul to the aliens.... oh she had met the emperor penguin when she was a little girl episode 9, she already forget she&#039;s part of the human race and would kill any human that dares to hurt a penguin)<br />
<br />
5. Rikantz Seaberry &amp; Irina Shidou<br />
<br />
6. Kiriko Kiyuna &amp; Asia Argent<br />
<br />
7. Kazuo Matayoshi &amp; Azazel<br />
<br />
8. Soriko Majikina &amp; Koneko Toujou<br />
<br />
9. Moriko Tomoyose &amp; Akeno Himejima (Moriko have simiar design to another anime series Chobits)<br />
<br />
10. Moriko Tomoyose &amp; Xenovia<br />
<br />
11. Shouma Ameku &amp; Yuuto Kiba<br />
<br />
12. Sewashiko Goya &amp; Irina Shidou<br />
<br />
13. Macaroni &amp; Irina Shidou (Macaroni&#039;s another girl who sold her body &amp; soul to the penguin emperor, similar image to Rias)<br />
<br />
14. Humboldt &amp; Asia Argent (Humboldt is not human but a genetically created penguin taking a human form) <br />
<br />
Shouma Ameku releasing a lot of hi-eros particles tranformed him into a penguin commando. But Kiriko&#039;s blinded love for Shouma makes her accept him for what he is..... talk about tough love, a reverse to the penguins when filled with huge amount of hi-eros particles turn then into humans.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re into the highschool dxd francised than this anime is for you.<br />
If you&#039;re into aliens invading, mankind&#039;s eminent extinction by taking away thier lusts than this anime is for you.<br />
If you&#039;re into giant man made piloted robots fighting giant enemy robots than this anime is for you.<br />
If you&#039;re into wierd humerous animes than this anime is for you.<br />
If you&#039;re too perverted and care less for the story than this anime is for you.<br />
<br />
At first I admit this anime sucks.... from the get go, but as the series goes on until the 11th.-12th. episode, it became interesting and turns out to be fun to watch.<br />
<br />
Enemies turned allies to help beat those who created the Beauty Prince Salon that threatens the very safety of those they swore to protect from the penguin empire.

    Hey folks, this will be a review for Kenzen Robo Daimidaler. This show isn&#039;t labeled a parody show, but it feels a lot like one. To be perfectly frank, the show is hard to swallow. I spent most of my time rolling my eyes and sighing. However I feel like simply marking this as a shitty attempt to pander to &quot;immature&quot; anime fans is kinda false in this case.<br />
<br />
The story is pretty straightforward. Bad guys from the penguin empire are attacking humans and trying to steal all of their Eros particles. Eros particles are exactly what they sound like(erotic particles). The show mainly is a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220604">
        robot fighting show. On one side we have the Penguin empire sending robots to steal Eros and try and defeat the human robot Daimidaler. The humans respond to attacks from the Penguins. <br />
<br />
The show is mostly episodic with a overarching theme of battle between these two groups. Some strange technology bits get thrown in from time to time and interesting curve balls like a human turning into a penguin and vice versa. However the story as a whole is rather weak. <br />
<br />
The art is fitting. The show was released in 2014, but it has that air of older anime. Thick lines, grimy and huge robot fights...etc. I noticed the shading or coloring was strange when the robots fought sometimes, but there is probably a reason for that. The soundtrack was strange but again fitting.<br />
<br />
The characters were again pretty weak. There is little to no real development. Each episode comes down to fighting spirit, boob groping and various other easily recognizable tropes. <br />
<br />
Now, many of the elements that people will use to grade an anime will totally sink this shows ratings. I also am in agreement it deserves it. I hate parody shows because they turn out one of two ways, pointless, or they become too much of what they are making fun of. However there are some things this show should be given credit for. <br />
<br />
First the jokes are kinda funny and felt honest to a degree. For example one time the penguins break into our MC&#039;s house and find his porn mags. He returns home and when he sees them  he runs away. Before they chase him they say its proper manners to put away the porn mags and put them back where they belong before chasing him. Another thing is the spoof doesn&#039;t turn the show into what its making fun of. The show has a flow to it and even as boring or slightly cringe as I found it, I still could enjoy some of the elements. A final thing I will credit is the ending dialogue between the Leader of the human robot side and the Japanese defense force commander. <br />
<br />
Rant:<br />
One things that boggles my mind still is how people can be told a show is ecchi or have naughty themes and still go into it thinking its ok to trash that aspect of the show. There are many types of ecchi shows and this one though heavy on it, also is using it as a driving force. I myself don&#039;t find this to be an excuse but seriously why bother if you cant handle sexual content?<br />
<br />
TLDR: Wouldn&#039;t recommend. Spoofy, ecchi, hard to enjoy as a whole. Has a few good moments.<br />
<br />

    talk about raging hormones eh.<br />
<br />
       Story:  the story is pretty simple good comes in and beat bad guys however there a twist to it they fight with robot fuel raging sex hormones you heard me right and yes the more horny you are the more powerful your machine get so there a lot of breasts grabbing and groping action going on and go start to finish. the thing is that tend tends to get weirder as the show progress like they for someone reason switch main character for a short period of time and showing different way to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295349">
        get a person horny.<br />
<br />
      character: I don&#039;t really need to get into detail about the characters since it a sex comedy without the actually sex however there this on character names Ritz and frankly I don&#039;t know if she has some kind of identity disorder or something is wrong because she tends to refer herself as &quot;we, and us&quot; but never uses her name nor I but did tell the emperor to call her by her names and btw she has no problem getting down and kinky as for the other character I find weird are the penguin and that a given especially when they have what they call a front tail no matter how they spin it people gonna think it a genitals just saying.<br />
<br />
      art/sound the art could of use more work however they definitely spend a lot of there time detail the females breasts I mean like the bosoms looks amazing like the shower scenes her breasts look like a perfect rain drop with nipples or someone really healthy athlete body I can&#039;t really describe all the well but yeah they put into a lot of detail but not as much as like high school dxd as for the sound goes ya no great and minds as well not have is all I&#039;m gonna say about it<br />
<br />
    Overall: now I a guy so ya I&#039;m gonna like and enjoy the fanservice but I do prefer the story plot more since I like to understand and get to know the characters and how things plays out. the problem is it not much of a story it straight forward and tot he point as I have mention in the story above. I knew that this show wasn&#039;t gonna be any good but I always say I give every show a chance before I judge it and sure it a bad show or st least an average show that will give a bit of comedy and I not ashamed to admit I like fan service and so if you like fan service the ya go and watch it and enjoy yourself but if your looking for an in depth story and purpose then ya I wouldn&#039;t even bother try and watch this it&#039;ll just drive you crazy..

    *Deep sigh*<br />
Man, I don&#039;t know where to start. Kenzen Robo Daimidaler. I encountered it while swimming through the depths of MAL. Even with the low &quot;rating&quot; it received from the viewers; I had to give the series a chance, so I watched it. The show was exactly the way I was anticipating it, which didn&#039;t surprise me. A boob show with little to nothing plot. Yes, me, too came here for &quot;plots&quot;. If you know what I mean.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 5<br />
As I&#039;ve said, Kenzen Robo Daimidaler is a nonsensical and carefree show. Clearly you would know what Kenzen Robo is all about when you look at its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175671">
        genres. As for the story, it&#039;s really easy to grasp what the story will be heading to just watching the first episode. I&#039;ll be rounding the little details, so you&#039;ll have a little idea what the show is about. Madanbashi Koichi, a perverted high school student who possesses a power known as &quot;high-ero&quot; (you might already have an idea how he powers up by now) partices is being recruited by Universal Hair Cut Alliance, an independent group who battles against the Penguin clan with giant robot known as Daimdaler. They&#039;re fighting with the penguin clan, a clan with huge di--- I mean, front tails. That&#039;s what they call them at least.<br />
That&#039;s basically the gist of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
Decent art, attention to details are great, especially on those mountains with marbles--- pink marbles at the top of &#039;em. Your inner manly side will come out in no time, you naughty bastard. Nothing to mention here anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 7<br />
The robot designs? I dont know what to say, maybe they were drunk when they drew it. It makes sense though. Why? Because Kenzen Robo&#039;s not a serious series. Not in any single way. Well, duh? As if something like groping someone&#039;s chest to power up would be serious. But then again, Seikon no Quaser&#039;s a serious series. Ugh, now I&#039;m confused. Anyway, let&#039;s get back to talking about the series before my poor brain breaks down because of thinking too much.<br />
Aside from the silly robots, the characters are fairly good. Knowing that the protagonist is a pervert, it would only be natural for him to be surrounded by girls wih voracious bodies. Don&#039;t get me wrong though, this is not a harem show, so girls won&#039;t be frolicking around Koichi. And I would like to nominate the Shouma and Kiriko for the most idiot couple of the year (2014, that is.). Kuhhhhhhh, man, they&#039;re one annoying couple. You&#039;ll see when you watch it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Music: 5<br />
Silly lyrics put up with rock theme, the opening that is. I wonder if the singer laughs inside when he thinks of the lyrics. The ending theme’s a lot more cutesy than the opening theme. Not much to mention anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6<br />
Is the series full of unnecessary fan service? Yes. Is it normal for shows to have this much fan service? No, but in the market now? Yes. Did I not enjoy it? A bittersweet yes and no. A part of me says “Yey! I get to ogle at mountains with marbles--- pink marbles for free.&quot; (Might as well watch a hentai if you&#039;re looking for a lot of those). And another part that says &quot;Can anyone remind me why I&#039;m wasting my time watching a series with little to no plot?&quot; (In case you&#039;re curious, no one reminded me because I&#039;m alone as heck ╥﹏╥). In short, the series is chuck full of &quot;plots&quot; but, not enough justifiable plots to back it off. I can&#039;t say I really enjoyed the series, but it definitely gave me something to do at my lonely nights. <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 6<br />
A show with poor story and full of fan services, which pretty much sums up Kenzen Robo Daimidaler. And the story progress is waaaaaaaay too fu**** up. It&#039;s like, something doesn&#039;t go well for this character in one of the episode and by the next episode he/she gets the candy for being bullied at the last episode. You get it, do you?<br />
 Most of the jokes in kenzen are puns using Japanese. In short, they won&#039;t make any sense for those who can&#039;t speak Japanese. Figures.<br />
If you&#039;re looking for a serious story, I advise you not to watch this. But if you&#039;re interested with mountains with pink marbles, you should give it a try. A fair warning though, the story is plain as a blank paper.<br />

    At first, it seems like an action based on a few ridiculous things.<br />
Looking back, I might say its like an exaggerated light-hearted show.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
Daimidaler has the preface of a typical harem/shounen show. But it tries to be a lot of things. Some of which it becomes successfully.<br />
Halfway though, it feels like it just starts heading in a random direction with the plot. I could already tell it wouldn&#039;t end how the protagonists wanted it to end. But the actual ending is actually pretty neat. Light-hearted, but goes out with a bang.<br />
It was pretty funny along the way too. Lacking, but still good.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
Average art. Nothing special, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review159473">
        has no problems either.<br />
Note:<br />
Large breasts on the female characters.<br />
Antagonists are penguins with tails where we would have our private parts. (how the heck do they reproduce???)<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The OP is energetic, fun and catchy. Whatever the ED was, oh well.<br />
I didn&#039;t really feel much from the soundtracks. They just sounded like your typical mood-setting tracks. I don&#039;t think they were used often either.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
The way the two protagonists sort of switch places is pretty interesting.<br />
(Main Protagonist) Kouichi is a pervert, and he has no problem being one. He is one with his inner self. Shallow, yet deep. Cool, manly, gets the girls, but still has lots to learn.<br />
(Main Protagonist) Shouma, or whatever his name was. I felt kinda frustrated halfway through the series when this character came in.<br />
Kinda lame. Has a girlfriend but in that kind of relationship where they are annoyingly lovey-dovey but not getting any farther than that. He does improve later on the series.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
I laughed a fair amount.<br />
When I think about it now, it feels like a light-hearted show.<br />
It was pretty interesting though, overall plot-wise.<br />

    Where to begin with this, shall we say &quot;unique&quot; anime....<br />
***SPOILER ALERT READ WITH CAUTION*****<br />
Alright I guess i&#039;ll start with the first category Story:<br />
So before I write anything let me say that I write this review in the context of what this anime is supposed to be, a lighthearted/comical story filled with ecchi scenes, big breasts galore and wacky storylines and events/logics.  This being said I still have to give the story an abyssmal rating of 3.  Why 3 you ask because 3 represents poor and that is the first word that comes into my head about this anime&#039;s story.  So we start

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205199">
        off simple enough with our soon to be MC just tryna peep on other women, we very quickly find out he loves big breasts and then we have our female lead show up and basically be the same generic hot/shy girl that makes most viewers gag.  Things don&#039;t really go up from there but as lenient as I can be in many respects on an ecchi anime like this, I can&#039;t excuse the sheer lack of time and effort put into the story.  In the simplest terms as i can use, the story is basically this:  Male protag meets female protag, both end up as &quot;co-pilots&quot; for a giant fighting robot that gets stronger based on how charged the male protag is on erotic things/thoughts (i.e groping the female protag) they fight bad guys, bad guys lose and come back stronger, both sides trade advantages over next few episodes with the &quot;antagonist&quot; introduced after the first &quot;battle&quot;.  Main protag &quot;dies&quot; and female protag gets knocked out.  Insert swerve sound here and bam now we follow a whole new female protag and new male protag, repeat events of first protag couple until penultimate battle where main protag couple comes back, two couples team up to fight bad guys.  Bad guys become good guys and government becomes the new bad guys.  At the end everyone says sorry, former bad guys go away happily ever after and good guys are at peace the end.  Did that sound boring and generic to you?  Good now you know how i feel.  <br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
Alright so we all know this is an ecchi we watched the anime for fanservice and some humor that much is understood.  That being said the art in this anime is actually pretty nice IF we&#039;re talking solely about the chracters.  By this I mean each alluring woman offered as fanservice is very well modeled and on the whole they all very appealing and good fanservice.  Personal favorite of course has to be Kyoko just because her look in general was great with close seconds being Chieko and Moriko.  Of particular note is details given to Ritz&#039;s eyes, and the various energy based attacks---they were all exceptional as well.  The backgrounds did the job well and the robots were passable albeit very clunky in design.  I suppose that was the intention here so in that light I&#039;ll give the art in this anime a very decent score, my only regret is kiriko and shouma had to take over for a few episode because they aren&#039;t as good as Kouichi and Kyoko.<br />
<br />
Sound:  So this review might be a bit lacking, I just don&#039;t pay too much attention to sound when I watch an ecchi.  Yeah the voice acting was okay/good and most other action sounds were generally good too, I just never was &quot;wow&#039;d&quot; by the sound in this anime so i&#039;ll give it a neutral score.<br />
<br />
Chracter: 6<br />
I can&#039;t even stand that i score it that high to be honest.  Basically everyone from the Prince organization---I hate their characters so damn generic.  Kyoko is the biggest albeit prettiest offender as she&#039;s just the usual big boobed tsundere type that eventually likes Kouichi&#039;s shall we say attention.  Kiriko and shouma are no better albeit Shouma&#039;s &quot;gulliver&quot; was funny the first time he did it.  Chiezo made a good slutty teacher character (and again looked very nice).  The only reason i give this anime a 6 is because of Ritz and the penguiin empire.  I have to say the idea of crazed human sympathizer isn&#039;t revolutionary but man Ritz&#039;s way of doing it was just great.  Always referring to herself in 2nd person, always having that constant level of charm in both anger and happiness, her character was refreshing.  But the best part had to be the penguins I mean just look at them.  They&#039;re humanoid black and white things with giant dick-like tails.  The very concept is so odd that its actually funny.  Pair these two with the &quot;emepeor&quot; penguin who tries his hardest to be serious and we have some decent characters in an otherwise bleak environment.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:  9<br />
WAIT WHY THE HELL DO YOU GIVE IT A 9 IF YOU HATE THE STORY AND CHARACTERS?  <br />
well that&#039;s easy, because the anime succeeding in being entertaining despite its flaws.  As much as the story and some characters made me cringe, the little things like the general populace fearing the good guys in fights, or the two leaders who try way too hard to be serious made me laugh.  Not to mention that fanservice was generally well done here.  I mean lets face it Kyoko was hot and Chieko is the kind of teacher you&#039;d want to give in to.  Put all this with an MC who is just too eager to follow up and we have genuine humor.  I also give the enjoyment a slight bump up because I&#039;m a massive mecha fan even if this one doesn&#039;t make the best use out of them.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall:  6<br />
yeah if i&#039;m gonna actually give a serious opinion on &quot;would i reccomend this anime&quot; then I&#039;d have to say no to most people.  To other ecchi loving, wacky loving fans like myself I&#039;d say yes go watch it.  But to a general fan of anime I&#039;d say no don&#039;t waste your time, too many problems too few good points.  So if you fit that first category of viewers then Hell yeah go watch this anime.  But if you&#039;re the more casual or serious viewer then stay away.

    This show is boring and I didn&#039;t like it.<br />
<br />
I was pretty excited from seeing the trailer because I love over-the-top crazy absurd themes and concepts. I certainly enjoy other ecchi anime series.<br />
<br />
This though...well...gets very tiresome, very fast. There&#039;s certainly an art to how to make an ecchi anime ridiculous, and hilarious. And that art is how to balance content with variety.<br />
<br />
No one likes hearing the same joke 24 times right? Well -- thats essentially my experience here. I enjoyed episode 1 --<br />
<br />
And then I was bored. It&#039;s the same thing on repeat. <br />
<br />
And then I was confused, as I found myself cheering for the antagonist

          <span style="display: none;" id="review347389">
        instead.  Rationalizing why the main characters are boring.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a weird show and I don&#039;t understand it. Would not recommend to anyone, even if they did like ecchi -- only if you like watching the same gimmick / joke on repeat.

    tl;dr: A parody mecha anime that’s nonsensical and pretty rough but still has pretty enjoyable parts.<br />
<br />
Kenzen Robo Daimidaler is a parody of the mech genre. I think it’s important to clarify the distinction between parody and satire in this case though as they are very often used interchangeably. A parody is an imitation that exaggerates for comedic effect. Satire is the use of parody or other humor for the purposes of criticism. This anime very much imitates old school mecha anime and greatly exaggerates and twists all the tropes for comedy purposes. However, this isn’t meant to criticize these tropes, but is rather basically a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416774">
        self-indulgent celebration of them that pretty much just wants to have fun.<br />
<br />
The plot involves a mysterious race of what looks like people wearing penguin suits known as Penguins trying to steal the Hi-Ero particles from humanity but a group known as Prince trying to stop them and various mech battles between the two ensuing as a result. The mechs that Prince uses, Daimidaler, are powered by Hi-Ero particles, which are basically released when people get horny. Thus, Daimidaler is piloted by two people, one that actually serves as a pilot, and the second that is basically supposed to help the pilot get turned on. All of this is utterly ridiculous nonsense that is used to great effect. It actually acts like it’s being serious most of the time giving things fancy names based on dead languages or with characters throwing out deep sounding one liners or even monologues as you would expect from a mecha anime. It also has a lot of mecha, battle shounen, and sentai tropes such as the hardass mentor character, training arcs, secret bases with secret entrances, sudden entrances by the hero, yelling really loudly when fighting, etc. However, everything is so dumb that this contrast is just plain hilarious. It’s also utterly random, with completely random things like the characters just suddenly bowling while a character is talking about important stuff and such. On top of that, it also has pretty decent normal humor, so just all around the comedy in the anime is pretty solid.<br />
<br />
In terms of cast there are three sets of main characters that matter essentially. There’s the original Daimidaler pilot pair, Kouichi and Kyouko that are heavily focused on at the start. Kouichi is a hot blooded and aggressive pervert. Kyouko is more calm and collected but also a pervert, though secretly and seemingly reluctantly. Considering their personalities and how Daimidaler operates, it should be clear where most of the comedy centered around them comes from. They have really good chemistry together which makes them pretty likable and they keep a pretty fast pace to their crazy antics so they’re just pretty hilarious to watch in general. There’s no real relationship development though, which disappointed me more than it should have to be honest considering I knew the type of anime it was starting out.<br />
<br />
There’s also a second pair of Daimidaler pilots, Shouma and Kiriko. Their gimmick is basically fitting the bacouple trope, which is a portmanteau of baka and couple which basically translates to stupid couple. They’re basically just a really annoying couple and how annoying they are and how annoyed they make everyone else is focused on pretty strongly. This is supposed to be comedic, but it largely didn’t land at all for me, and thus the episodes introducing them were incredibly weak as the episodes are pretty much entirely focused on them and their annoyingness. It gets better as the anime continues on and they’re no longer the singular focus and their relationship also gets a bit more complicated in an amusing fashion that feels fitting considering how annoying they are, but I found them pretty unlikable throughout.<br />
<br />
The last set of important characters are the Penguin Empire. They’re the villains in that they embody all the villain tropes while the ones they’re fighting against embody all the hero tropes, but in terms of actual good and evil it’s pretty nebulous. They never really try to do anything too bad and actually seem to care about preventing collateral damage a lot more than the heroes do. While I didn’t find them as amusing as Kouichi and Kyouko, they were way better than Shouma and Kiriko, and so I found them pretty decently likable. There are essentially three characters in the Penguin Empire. There’s the Penguin Emperor who commands all the other Penguins and seems to try his best to be a good caring leader. There’s Ritz, a super energetic human girl that joins the Penguins due to her penguin fetish and serves as their best mech pilot. And lastly there are the various indistinct minion Penguins, who have different names and I suppose are technically distinct characters, but with a few exceptions are all pretty much the same in that their main defining traits are that they’re pretty airheaded and kind of perverted and that thus essentially feel like a single character. They are focused on somewhat from the start, but get focused more and more during the latter half which serves as a good distraction from Shouma and Kiriko.<br />
<br />
There are also various side characters on both the Prince and Penguin Empire side as well as a few completely outside of them. They’re not that important and never have enough of a presence for me to feel much about them in any capacity. Still, they spice things up in terms of comedy and such so I suppose they did their job.<br />
<br />
The plot is pretty simplistic and for the most part just involves the Penguins and Prince getting into a bunch of fights. The mech battles are surprisingly decent. Though they start off a bit weak, with the mech designs being especially weak, by the end the action is a lot stronger and the mech designs too are much improved. As a result of these battles various character stuff happens which push things along in terms of characters. There are attempts at serious story beats wherein despite how ridiculous they are and how they’re very much focused on trying to be funny still somehow manage to have a decent amount of impact. This isn’t the case for all of the attempts at such though. It’s a mixed bag, wherein while some moments work quite well a lot also simply miss their mark. I’d say in general the ones that are supposed to be exciting, intense, or just plain cool work well, while moments that are supposed to be romantic, heartwarming, or anything like that usually fail. When they fail they fail really hard and it feels like nothing, not even the comedy is really working though, which makes certain parts of the anime feel like they’re really just a complete drag. Still, there are also a lot of pretty great moments that build up over time. In the end there’s a final twist where the true villain is the one trying to bring common sense into things and ruin everyone’s fun, which results in the anime shifting to trying to push a message about how perversion is actually good. It’s not handled that great, being way too heavy handed, but it fits the anime pretty well and results in an ending that’s pretty satisfying all things considered.<br />
<br />
The art and animation are pretty solid and are very effective for the things that really matter. As mentioned, the mech designs I didn’t like much at first but the later ones were much better. The animation for the action was also really solid. The character designs all around were pretty good and the animation for them was also solid for the ecchi portions. The OP was pretty hype inducing and served as a good start to each episode. The use of the OP during battles was also well done. There was also a softer, slower version of the OP that was used as background music at one point that I also thought was pretty well done. The ED was okay. The soundtrack was pretty great when it was trying to be heroic. There were random tracks like one that felt like a remix of the US Army’s official song that felt pretty funny and thus fit. Outside of that the soundtrack wasn’t all that memorable.
