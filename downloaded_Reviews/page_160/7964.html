    Category: Ecchi<br />
Rank: Tier 1<br />
<br />
<br />
Premise: &quot;Suspension Bridge Effect&quot; It&#039;s the rapid heartbeat and arousal when in state of danger. Named after it&#039;s discovery of friends and/or people of the opposite sex tended to get married right after experiencing a tall bridge crossing. When in danger your biological alarm kicks in as a form of a reality check, All living beings are meant to procreate. The phenomenon released chemicals inducing individuals to fall in love and a need to have intercourse after a hyper sense of arousal on a very aware state.<br />
<br />
On Masou Gakuen HxH Episode 01. Hida, Kizuna and Chidorigafuchi are under attack by an alien

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230574">
        mecha force; the heroine in question on a almost near death situation with an already state of danger both Kizuna and Chidori blush and simultaneously suffered from rapid and increasing heartbeats. All this while Kizuna touches Aine on a erotic manner arousing her and driving her to climax. After the &quot;Heart x Hybrid&quot; takes place the heroine is seen pressing her hand against her chest when Kizuna was talking to both Himekawa Hayuru and Yurishia Farandole on a flirty manner or at least is seen in such manner by Chidorigafuchi Aines eyes. <br />
<br />
 The name of the phenomenon &quot;Heart x Hybrid&quot; which is later explained by the commander of &quot;Amaterasu&quot; Hida Reiri, Amaterasu being the name of the Japanese force against other world invaders, Reiri says that &quot;HxH&quot; is not be outright lewd and/or actions but a state of synchronization between Body and Soul.The Heart Hybrid Phenomenon is later expanded upon on Episode 02 when Yurishia Farandole achieves this when Kizuna merely places his hand over her left breast, reinforcing that a psychological x danger requirements are a necessity rather then outright lewdness for power up as many can easily misunderstand. This means endorphin s are creating the love state whilst the human body becomes aroused with lust. This directly results on the power up of the &quot;Heart x Hybrid Armor&quot; and / or &quot;Magitech Armor&quot; as it is referenced later on the show. A weapon which is the only weapon for humanity.<br />
<br />
Twist: Although &quot;Heart x Hybrid&quot; grants enhanced abilities powered by the synchronization of Love and Lust. It uses spiritual energy as well as fuel, The state and power of &quot;Magitech Armor&quot; it&#039;s directly correlated to &quot;HxH Points&quot; who directly affects power output of the armor and ability to protect it&#039;s user.<br />
<br />
If the Heart x Hybrid points were to reach Zero it would result in immediate death for whomever uses the armor. A fact that only the commander and/or sister or Kizuna &quot;Hida Reiri&quot; and Kizuna our MC knows. this becomes his coping mechanism as he seems to operate under the thought that lewd things and/or Heart Hybrid + Climax Hybrid are nothing more than maintenance and he does it with the outlook of protecting his comrades lives. he becomes vigilant making sure none of his team members Heart Hybrid Points reach the Danger zone which is 15% or Below. <br />
<br />
Heart Hybrid participants experience the power up because they all have gone through body modification, They&#039;ve injected invading alien Mecha core that seems to respond to a combination of Love and Lust. Normal women don&#039;t get a power up because they can&#039;t since they haven&#039;t been modified themselves.<br />
<br />
Ecchi Builder: Kizuna must come up with unique ideas to accelerate healing on Heart Hybrid participants by doing lewd actions. This lewd factor absorbs the rest of the genres on a satisfactory way on which the lewdness facilitate battle engaging, Character development towards one another as well as opening up about their individual experience as human experiments growing up in order to fight other world invasion and halt humanity progress towards extinction. <br />
<br />
Plot Overview: 15yrs + ago humanity was attacked by another world and was humiliated into submission. Even though the enemies left most of humanity was killed and weren&#039;t seen again until 6 months prior to the present of this story. Humanity has been kicked out of their respective countries and have no other choice but to live on &quot;mega floats&quot;. Artificial countries floating about on the ocean. most nations and their inhabitants have been killed off and those whom wander the ocean goal is to take back their respective countries.<br />
<br />
The surviving countries all have specialized teams that can fend off the other world advanced technology. a team of people wearing the &quot;Magitech Armor&quot; and/or &quot;Heart x Hybrid Gear&quot;. aside from the goal of taking back their respective lands, teams of each respective nations such as &quot;USA, Japan, Russia, China etc&quot; must seal inter-dimensional gates that serve as portal from this world to the next as well as to reclaim their land under enemy control. <br />
<br />
Animation: Throughout the years we&#039;ve seen experimentation of the anime industry to use 3D animation to reduce cost, Keep animated consistency, Facilitate mass producing of more anime and possibly keep more money for better pay while trying to keep the &quot;Japanese animation history&quot; of authenticity. They&#039;re tried from fully 3D all the way varying 2D textures on 3D models. Some kinda succeed and some end up like &quot;Berserk&quot;. Most anime studios have reached the conclusion to keep 2D characters while just 3D environments. One of the first projects to do this was the anime &quot;Tokyo Ravens&quot; or earlier one like &quot;To Love-Ru&quot; season one when displaying alien creatures and some inventions but as someone who has seen &quot;Kizumonogatari&quot; movie, Shaft has mastered it.<br />
<br />
On Masou Gakuen HxH there are 3D modeling but somehow Studio IMS has given a whole new breed on a 2D Fusion with 3D. The result are noticeable on the characters as they seem multi dimensional without feeling boxy like standard 3D. The art feel more fluid and more solid as per substance on the artwork. The enemies keep a higher amount of 3D but it isn&#039;t a issue since the main point of the series lies on Erotism. With that I think it was a good call.<br />
<br />
It isn&#039;t perfect all the time since Production IMS had their hands full the entire season handling  &quot;Active Raid&quot; simultaneously. however the episodes that did managed to get through the animation it is superb.<br />
<br />
Sound: It puts hentai voice acting to shame, The voice actors /actress do a very good job at the erotic scenes.<br />
<br />
Characters: Ecchi / Harem are pretty standard, It&#039;s flooded with Tsunderes and some Kuderes. Minus the Yanderes. The writer Kuji has been paying attention to successful ecchi on the industry and has grabbed the best from past / current ecchis.<br />
<br />
Himekawa Hayuru: it&#039;s a nitpick out of To Love Ru, Since her personality is 88% Kotegawa Yui &quot;The One Yelling Shameless All the time&quot; but twisted on a more assertive fashion and a little less tsundere. Her personality it&#039;s well thought out though as it becomes evident why &quot;Shameless&quot; things bother her and ultimately what bothers her is slacking off.<br />
<br />
She is very much obsessed with morality and being proper. Himekawa also harbors the need to be competent due to her once arrogant demeanor got many Japanese citizens killed while she was on escort duty to transfer them to the Japanese mega float.<br />
<br />
Currently her sense of duty is near an obsession that she is trying to get over with. she is fully aware that Ataraxia is a military school of sorts and to her relationships equals lewd things which ultimately means slacking off. her pursuit to keep people or rather students in check from doing anything it&#039;s a damage control of hers trying to keep her fellow class mates from having to experience what she saw when escorting Japanese citizens to the mega float.<br />
<br />
<br />
Chidorigafuchi Aine: An orphan who lost everything and doesn&#039;t know how much she lost. She is cold on the outside and always seems to portray a seemingly god complex to sustain her ego and maintain her constitution afloat of being the best so that she may be useful to the cause.<br />
<br />
Her personality is explained through her dark past and how she developed that personality. As an amnesiac orphan who sees her worth strictly correlated to her fighting capabilities. She will do anything to obtain power to maintain her world view of being worth something for capabilities only, instead of her persona. She would offer up her body if need be.<br />
<br />
If I had to give you a blend of characters to accurately tell you about her, I would say she has a 46% Senjougahara Hitagi on regards to attitude and self worth. This also is shown on her aesthetic relationship with the MC Kizuna Hida. Then I could add a 34% Xenovia Quarta on regards to thirst of fighting and desire for power and improvement as well as some aspects to sexual matters. The remainder 20% it&#039;s up to you guys, Though personally I think is Asia Argento. Which isn&#039;t all there is since later on she becomes a different persona upon reaching a mutated state that her silver hair becomes PINK that just gives off and astounding air of confidence.<br />
<br />
Yurishia Farandole: This character can only give you one flashback, That is the black haired beauty Akeno from High School DxD. The is a sadist and a tease all the same but on a much open form for interaction. she comes from a wealthy family of America.<br />
<br />
An American on the Japanese &quot;Amaterasu&quot; team, former leader of the american &quot;Masters&quot; team. though she posses traits of a sadist she mostly gives off an older sister if not motherly vibe. she has the trait of being very protective of those she cares about and/or those on her team as made evident on episode 2 and sent Kizuna away trying to beat the danger herself and confirmed later on when her conflict with the current head of the &quot;Masters&quot; Scarlet Fairchild was revealed. Yurishia will not hesitate to lie to her peer to get them out of harms way. even if it means getting herself in deeper danger while trying to resolve what she deems great threats herself.<br />
<br />
She often stresses herself being protective and like many on a position of being a care giver she deeply wishes that someone would take care of her as well. this is what opens up and new section and allows for her to become the &quot;receiver&quot; or &quot;masochist&quot; since she is into BDSM and / or S&amp;M. as she can get into either role but harbors desire to be the one receiving the punishment since it allows her to escape all the burdens she places on herself.<br />
<br />
Hida Kizuna : He is the troyan horse of this kind of anime and this anime in particular. At a glance it would deceive you to think he is yet another generic main character who is as dense as condensed milk and as thick as an oak tree.<br />
<br />
[Note: I can guarantee that if his design were different and he posses another hair color many would go gaga over him.]<br />
<br />
As they say, Looks can be deceiving and this is the case for Hida Kizuna. Masamune Kuji really gave this a thought and gave us an MC with abandonment issues. As a child he was deliberately orphaned by his mother once he proved useless to her on regards to human experimentation and saw her son would prove little as a utility and wasted no time in discarding him as a ragged cloth. since he would no longer present any form of advancement for her experiments and weapon development.<br />
<br />
This aspect would prove useful so that he would always seek improvement and a sense of duty to protect his peers. As prude as he is, he disregards it under the shadow of being discarded once again and he feels bound to be useful and often will be angry when told to do nothing. This quality unifies our MC with our heroines who at first went after him lusting for power. this bond with different forms of troublesome pasts that would come crucial on Heart x Hybrids which are literally Love and Lust. All born from self preservation and desire to survive. creating and ever evolving bond between our cast and deepening trust among themselves.<br />
<br />
To reiterate the &quot;power&quot; he was lusted after or depending on the countries respective team is lusted after currently. it is because &quot;Heart x Hybrid Points&quot; takes up weeks in going back to normal and time isn&#039;t a thing anyone of this world can spare. <br />
<br />
Eros his &quot;Magitech Armor&quot; is capable to refill anyone armor restoring in one go their fighting capabilities and capacity being god sent to the teams that wish to triumph and survive. Eros is also capable of mutating any magitech armor increasing power output and granting higher tier weaponry. the weaponry in question can be absorbed by eros granting him any variable weapon he &quot;Climax Hybrid&quot; with which would be the mutated state of the magitech armor after surpassing the limiters of recovering regarding &quot;Heart x Hybrid Points&quot;. many disregarding what lewd actions and sentimental proximity needed for it to happen. However understandable why Chidorigafuchi Aine and/or other women from other &quot;Heart x Hybrid&quot; teams want to meet Kizuna and/or stay on his good graces. Kizuna represents an unprecedented advantage for humanity and certainly a trump card that can make any team who has him more resilient in battle and power in comparison to those who wait maybe even months to get back to normal once their &quot;Heart x Hybrid Points&quot; are spent. <br />
<br />
Hida Reiri is his moral compass and support so that his inner demons don&#039;t take over and to remain relevant and useful as his sister fulfilled his mothers role. fulfilled a role that was abandoned after he was discarded by his mother shortly after vanishing altogether.<br />
<br />
&quot;A persons value isn&#039;t decided by their abilities but on how they live&quot; -Hida Kizuna<br />
<br />
A quote that Kizuna always says to himself and that he has found useful to say to many other people to comfort them as his sister has comforted him and gave him hope and his feeling of being useless and ultimately possibly discarded once he becomes useless once again.<br />
<br />
If I had to give this character a blend to give you an analogy of who he is or where he stands. I would say he has a 26% Yuki Rito on a degree of pureness and prudeness, Followed by a 54% Basara (Shinmai Maou no Testament) on a sense of duty and desire to protect people or at least help out. The rest is unknown but the direction he is taking is that of Akatsuki Ousawa (Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero). He grows more confident as time transpires and less disturbed by lewdness as time goes on. Needless to say he can get the job done where many MC would have frozen in time. <br />
<br />
Overall 9.60: Masou Gakuen HxH creates atmosphere for a good lewdness factor absorbing and not getting on the way of the other genres native to the Tier 2 Ecchi. Such as Date A Live, Infinite Stratos, Hundred, Rakudai Kishi no Calvary and Gakusen Toshi no Asterisk. The characters on Masou Gakuen HxH are designed to chemically open to one another and when it comes to designs. Kuji made the right decision getting the legendary &quot;Hisasi&quot; the Doujin artist do his/her characters.<br />
<br />
Masou Gakuen HxH though giving the feeling of cramped, It&#039;s well set up since the very beginning. all characters are well knit into each other and each episode can reinforce past episode and/or set up the next on a satisfactory way.

    Stiff and inconsistent animation with 90&#039;s quality computer graphics; monotonous, boob-obsessed fanservice; vapid characters who yell and clinch their fists a lot to create the illusion of emotion where there is none.<br />
<br />
Masou Gakuen HxH is an uninspired clone of better anime that was produced with an appropriately low budget. It takes the premise from Infinite Stratos about the one guy with an ability to help attractive female fighters, and mashes it with the master-slave relationships from Shinmai Maou no Testament using a big tit-shaped sledgehammer. HxH lacks the fun of the former, and the sex appeal of the latter.<br />
<br />
On the positive side, Kizuna, the main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review229631">
        male character, wasn&#039;t an obnoxious gynophobe or raging pervert typical of harem anime. He was usually composed and diligent, and had no qualms with engaging in lewd sexual acts. On the negative side, he didn&#039;t have any memorable personality traits to elicit empathy from the audience. In nearly every scene he only provided one of three things: exposition, generic words of encouragement, or listless pseudo-sex with a girl from his harem.<br />
<br />
The female characters weren&#039;t any better, who, in their bulky &quot;hybrid gear&quot; attire, looked like balloon animals in shitty cosplay. They were nothing more than eye candy. No depth. No agency. Just walking body parts to be gazed upon, groped, and even humiliated.<br />
<br />
HxH would have been more enjoyable with deeper character personalities, smarter designs, and better sex. It usually takes more than a breast and ass massage to get a girl off. They somewhat figured this out at the last episode, but by then it was too little too late.

    I&#039;m sure a lot of people wrote this show off without even trying it simply because of the synopsis, the cover and the genre tags, and while I can&#039;t really blame them for doing so, I&#039;ll be the first one to admit that Masou Gakuen actually had potential. It really did. It had potential because it had a premise which promotes a lot of actual sexual interaction between its characters rather than merely relying on suggestive camera angles and such. Other than the general lack of originality, my main gripe with most battle harems is that they try to have some sort of serious story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review229642">
        whilst simultaneously having a lot of ecchi aspects, but ultimately they end up not really succeeding on either front. Masou Gakuen however had a real chance of at least succeeding with its sexual elements, which could very well have been enough to make it an above-average ecchi anime. But unfortunately it never manages to live up to that potential, largely thanks to an abundance of severe execution errors.<br />
<br />
The premise itself is about as generic and uninteresting as it gets: some alien invaders more or less conquered Earth and humanity is on its last ropes. The story then takes place at a remote high school where the students are trained to fight the extraterrestrial invaders. Sounds reasonable enough, except that humanity&#039;s last hope now rests on a group of teenagers in needlessly skimpy mecha suits powered by eroticism. Because you know, that sounds like a very reliable solution when the actual worldwide military&#039;s missiles, lasers and artillery shells evidentially weren&#039;t enough to stop them.<br />
<br />
In any case, we have our protagonist Hida Kizuna being sent to this school one day by his sister, with the purpose of literally fondling all the girls in it. Basically, the mecha suits in this show, called &quot;Heart Hybrid Gears&quot;, can be artificially powered up by sexually stimulating its wielder, enabling them to actually stand a chance at victory against the alien threat. And that&#039;s more or less what the anime is about: the MC consistently ends up in erotic situations with various girls and makes them orgasm in order for them to be able to help protect mankind. Perfect.<br />
<br />
Now I just want to make something very clear here: ending up with consistent sexual interactions is by no means a bad thing on paper. It&#039;s been proven many times in the past. The problem primarily lies with the underlying reason for why those scenes actually happen to begin with. Let&#039;s be real here, almost no one actually cares about the generic story when watching an anime like this. We&#039;re in it for the tits and ass and nothing more. So I have to ask, why do you need to go to these ridiculous lengths just to set up a scenario where sexual encounters can happen on a consistent basis? There&#039;s no reason it should have to be this complicated. Just look at something like Kiss x Sis for example: almost the entire anime revolves around two sisters lusting for their stepbrother and ending up in borderline hentai situations with him all the time. Why? Because they love him. That&#039;s literally all there is to it. We didn&#039;t need some alien invasion or mumbo jumbo ero-power or anything like that; all it took was affection, and it worked out great. But in Masou Gakuen we end up with a scenario where literally everything except for the ecchi scenes is absolutely terrible, and as a result it ends up severely dragging down the enjoyment of said ecchi scenes as well since they become so far-fetched and forced in the process.<br />
<br />
Another huge make-or-break factor for ecchi/harems is of course the heroine cast, and this anime is is also a big disappointment on that front. They&#039;re all extremely shallow and stereotypical, and pretty much solely exist for the sake of being someone for the MC to get his hands on. They&#039;re the kind of girls whose entire characterization can be summarized by their breasts, and speaking of which, more than half of them also have these horrible physics-defying watermelon boobs which I&#039;m getting seriously fed up with by now.<br />
<br />
One comment you end up seeing fairly often from ecchi haters is that &quot;ecchi anime is useless since you could just watch hentai instead&quot;, and while I don&#039;t agree with this logic since there are multiple other reasons to watch ecchi anime beyond just to get off to them, in Masou Gakuen&#039;s case I&#039;m almost inclined to say it&#039;d probably be true. Because seriously the ecchi scenes in this anime are not seductive, creative, fetishy or anything like that; they&#039;re basically censored porn. Like they&#039;re not actually having sex but we pretty much get finger banging, cunnilingus and more, and the girls are evidentially orgasming as a result of it. I mean it&#039;s literally the kind of explicit stuff that belongs in hentai, merely that we don&#039;t get to see genitalia directly. On top of that the girls are treated like nothing more than sexual objects rather than respectable characters, which is also something you&#039;d expect to find in hentai instead. They&#039;re like walking manikins whose sole reason for existing is to be molested. Honestly I find it genuinely disrespectful, and I bet feminists would have a field day with it if they gave this anime a shot. So whenever I was watching one of the &quot;bonding&quot; scenes of Masou Gakuen, I just couldn&#039;t help but feel like there really wasn&#039;t much point to it given the available options.<br />
<br />
On top of those scenes though, the anime also has some more generic and lame ecchi content such as the aforementioned skimpy mecha outfits they&#039;re all wearing. I&#039;ve always wondered whether anime creators expect their viewers to be masturbating or being hyped when they put these half-naked anime girls into life-or-death battles so often... you can&#039;t both have the cake and eat it after all. Also sometimes it feels like the anime is seriously trying to enforce ecchi content when it really shouldn&#039;t, for example there&#039;s this one scene where the bad guys have captured one of the girls and are supposedly going to torture her for information, so what do they do? Of course, they decide to strip her and try to make her climax in the hopes that that&#039;ll make her talk. Not only does this make no sense from a logical standpoint, but also do you really expect me to be turned on from some cringeworthy and irrational torture scene? Like seriously?<br />
<br />
Ultimately I just can&#039;t understand what the actual intention is behind anime like this. If they&#039;re trying to turn people on, why does the mecha fighting and cringeworthy plot elements even exist? And if they&#039;re trying to create an exciting post-apocalyptic action show, there&#039;s obviously no need for all this facepalm-worthy &quot;ero power&quot; crap. If you wanted to come up with an ecchi anime where the MC has a legitimate excuse for doing sexual things to girls on a consistent basis, you could just do something like a show with a normal guy in a normal high school who one day gets cursed so that if he doesn&#039;t do something erotic with girls on a frequent basis then something bad will happen to him, or something like that. I&#039;m not saying that would be an amazing anime, but on paper it already sounds a lot better than what Masou Gakuen is doing, and that took me like 5 seconds to think up. The bottom line is: if you want to do a show revolving around sexual encounters, just keep things simple. Just do enough in order to make the scenes not feel forced and leave it at that. Proper execution of the ecchi scenes is literally all most of the viewers actually care about after all. Doing things the other way around is just naïve and ignorant.<br />
<br />
So is there anything good about Masou Gakuen in the end? Well the OP and ED were both pretty decent so that&#039;s something at least, but that&#039;s hardly enough to carry it. I guess if you&#039;re a diehard fan of all things ecchi and don&#039;t care about execution quality at all then you might want to give this a shot, but otherwise I really wouldn&#039;t recommend it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and as the cherry on top we get an inconclusive cliffhanger ending followed by “To Be Continued”. Could it possibly get any better?

    Masou Gakuen HxH is a light novel adaptation about a bunch of scantily clad mecha-using female warriors fighting a bunch of other scantily clad mecha-using female warriors from another dimension...yes this is a light novel adaptation, why do you ask? Oh you thought it was a hentai game adaptation? Pft, when was the last time those things showed up? Anyways, continuing on from that self-inflicted interruption, the show is about these female warriors fighting each other for a reason that isn&#039;t really elaborated on because why should plot matter in an anime about underage girls fighting with their tits hanging out, with the good guy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review231149">
        side having that one lone male who makes you question which side you&#039;re supposed to be rooting for because he&#039;s a dick and every being with an extra X chromosome falls for him anyways no matter what side they&#039;re on? Oh yeah, and these mecha suits are powered by sexual lust for some reason, thus this one guy must charge up these females&#039; fighting energy by giving them orgasms. And whilst females in hentai can get orgasms very easily, I think the producers of this show had some sort of internal bet in regards to how little a man has to do before getting his woman wet. Because the only sex moves that show up in this thing are boob groping and what I can only assume are cowgirl positions that came out of a book called &quot;How To Pretend To Have Sex For Dummies&quot;, and yet these girls react to them like they&#039;re in a Takaoka Motofumi doujin.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;ve seen one shitty harem light novel adaptation, you&#039;ve seen them all, and putting in &quot;animated sex&quot; that&#039;d embarrass a shitty flash adaptation adds pretty much nothing to the formula other than more shame, and it&#039;s not even enough shame to be noteworthy. There&#039;s a bit of paraphrasing going on in the previous paragraph, but otherwise that&#039;s pretty much the entire show. Guy gets stuck in an all-girl section of what passes for military in anime world and proceeds to toy with their emotions whilst dealing with a paint-by-the-numbers plot that even a machine by Professor Frink from The Simpsons would have been embarassed to churn out. And I didn&#039;t make that Takaoka Motofumi reference lightly. If you&#039;ve never read any of his doujins, they generally consist of asshole males with bad haircuts raping females that are either big busted housewives pretending to be high schoolers or twelve-year old lolis with nipples so perky you could cut glass with them all in the name of &quot;love&quot;. As such, no one is spared. Except for the sister I guess, but after seeing who gets laid in this show, you&#039;d wish the main dude had gone the incest route instead.<br />
<br />
The reason I stuck with this show was because it seemed like it&#039;d be a bit raunchier than the average LN series. I mean its very first scene depicted a girl taking it up the butt, which caused me to think that maybe this trash was at least going to be a little tongue-in-cheek regarding the light novel craze the way people thought that godawful Who Is Imouto anime was going to play out before it actually started taking itself seriously and turned the kinda funny stalker angle into the shittiest mystery on the planet. Even if the end result was destined to be shit, maybe it won&#039;t be that mediocre/middle-of-the-ground shit I hate so much because there&#039;s nothing to say other than it&#039;s boring. No such luck I&#039;m afraid, because after the first episode, the show reveals that the main females are whiny tsunderes who don&#039;t know what the fuck they want whilst the main dude...um, actually he doesn&#039;t have any problems with feeling up his childhood friend and their little sister, so maybe I got a little more of my wish than I thought.<br />
<br />
In addition to the repetitiveness of the sex moves, very little actual nudity is really shown until late in the game, and that&#039;s assuming you&#039;re watching the AT-X version rather than the laughably censored Crunchyroll version. And it always tries to be coy about it even when it does show up to the point that calling out someone else&#039;s name during intercourse would be less of a turn-off. I know it sells and all, but I think Production IMS missed a few memos when they decided to become a fanservice studio, because there are a few things you have to keep in mind with porn assuming you&#039;re a teenage boy or lesbian who wants to please their frustrated libido without having to pay for it like a loser. One, most porn is absolute shit. I remember when I was introduced to my first porn site and trying to find something that was actually arousing was like trying to find a hot woman in a nude beach that&#039;s not in Central America. Two, most successful porn are executed with characters that have confidence, and the only confidence you can expect out of light novel stereotypes are the wishy-washy kind that get mad at their men for interacting with women who have every right to do so on account of them not being &quot;girls&quot;. Three, your anime is on broadcast TV. Even with the horrible censors, you can&#039;t actually show stuff with real balls, let alone real balls. Four, just because you&#039;re making smut doesn&#039;t mean it has to be low-budget. Get some goddamn money rolling into your products, dudes.<br />
<br />
The show gets particularly shitty in the final few episodes where the loli joins the fray for absolutely no reason whatsoever other than because the show felt like it wasn&#039;t pedo enough and decided it might as well go the extra mile. I have a few companions online who like watching this sort of perverted trash, and they all agreed that the show went too far when she got involved. Better not introduce them to the doujin series, Rapiere. They&#039;d probably set themselves on fire if they saw just how low a female version of The Three Musketeers could sink. See, for a show that sells itself on using sex as a weapon, I was expecting something on the level of Sausage Party or Dororon Meera Mera Enma-kun where the big evil is defeated by a giant orgy and the main dude&#039;s sexual prowess is so powerful that he ends up getting every female in the world to leak sweat just by his mere aura, including the big evil. But no, the show ends with a bunch of poorly done action scenes followed by the main dude holding hands with the white-haired girl, who I think is supposed to be the main female lead, but the show doesn&#039;t do a good job of convincing me on that front for reasons I&#039;m not going to get into because you don&#039;t care. Talk about a show that climaxed too early, huh?<br />
<br />
Masou Gakuen HxH wanted to prove to the world that it had a big dick, so it took a bunch of forbidden substances to give off the illusion that it could stand alongside the &quot;manly&quot; anime, only to end up getting too overexcited to the point that it blew its load early and ended up pretty pointless the rest of the way through. Its animation was flaccid, its characters limp, its comedy plain sucked, and what passes for sex and a plot just hurts to think about. Can&#039;t really see much of anything to recommend about the show. Even a heavily censored hentai on Youtube would be more exciting to watch, if only because there&#039;s a certain absurd humor to be found in how only ten percent of the screen is actually visible whilst the other ninety percent is so blurry you&#039;d have better visibility watching the real thing underwater.

    Another harem, ecchi, romance, school, mecha, sci-fi and action anime has just ended,........I&#039;d never understand as to why two top reviews of this anime give this anime a 10 over this simulated porn anime? Nevertheless, here were my ratings:<br />
<br />
Storywise, just another sci-fi anime where being from another world comes and threatens humanity and it&#039;s up to some individuals with such capabilities, as those otherworldly beings has and that&#039;s the plot which is the same as another anime being aired at the same season, Scared Rider Xechs, so plotwise they maybe the same , but Scared Rider Xech has more sensible story plot that this one,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review229756">
        where everything was just about them girls getting molested by a guy or one of their own , which is why this category is a 1 over 10. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art, I gave it an 8 over 10 and as a guy I need not tell you.......Ok, so I admit , the porn thingy got to me and the boobs.<br />
<br />
Sound, I gave it a 6 over 10, since I just feel like it.....and I kinda like the climax (a bit) while them girls were being done by the guy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character, let&#039;s see, we have the quintessential, tsudere, samurai girl, and big boob American bimbo and a guy who has to do them in order to boost them up......oh and there is the quintessential loli, that the guy also done. The rest were just whores for fantasizing, like Scarlet and her bitches and The last boss and her legion of Batlantis whores, so it&#039;s a 1 over 10. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment, ok so an 8 over 10, the same reason as the &quot;Art&quot; category.<br />
<br />
Overall, If they&#039;re gonna make a season 2 of this, maybe studio Production IMS should think again, since this anime was all about boobs, orgasm and simulated porn, so overall, its a pathetic 1 over 10. So, no to season 2.<br />
<br />
<br />
EROS!!!!!!!!!

    Porn with a Plot, yeah went straight into it huh...no but seriously.<br />
<br />
LA will be straight with you, LA had obvious reasons to try and NOT watch this anime for Summer 2016, however Masou Gakuen HxH still surprised LA for even ecchi standards...it was still awkward, hell yes, but still for the people thinking this anime is nothing but a borderline hentai...well yeah...but even a hentai has something of a plot....&quot;something&quot; being the emphasis.<br />
<br />
Like just from reading the premise, this anime is like Infinite Stratos but ramp up the fanservice levels to GODLY, then just add in the borderline hentai sex scenes and you have Masou

          <span style="display: none;" id="review229650">
        Gakuen HxH, but Masou Gakuen HxH has even a sliver of a plot LA can get interested (omitting the sex scenes anyways). What&#039;s the sliver of plot LA was soo interested in?.<br />
<br />
It was the entire mystery to Aine Chidorigafuchi voiced by Akari Kageyama, as to who she is and why the mystery connection to the Magitech and the more dangerous Commanders of the Magitech, why are the invading Magitech forces want, the significance of Hida Kizuna the main protagonist and his &quot;only one man&#039;s special powers&quot; along with his mother issues, all these questions link Aine and Hida together. LA did say a silver you know, however that &quot;silver&quot; of a plot is what makes this anime move forward and it becomes intriguing as long as you see behind all the borderline-hentai.<br />
<br />
The fanservice...well considering that this anime got out uncensored was quite baffling but all the more, LA did say that the fanservice was in GODLY levels, everything from uncensored boobs to foreplay and even threesomes and BDSM...don&#039;t ask why LA knows these. *cough* either way, Masou Gakuen HxH&#039;s focus on it&#039;s borderline hentai scenes as it encompasses a rather minority of the anime where even though it has &quot;hentai scenes&quot; once every episode, the main focus rather goes to developing the main cast of the Heart Hybrid Gear users and Hida Kizuna voiced by Kenji Akabane. But seriously you SHOULD know what your going into when watching this anime...it&#039;s on the PREMISE people.<br />
<br />
In terms of characters, you&#039;d think most of them are pretty much spank material, however as LA said that there IS a plot to this anime, there is at least a bit of character development from most of the Heart Hybrid Gear members, Aine who LA already talked about, Yurishia Farandole voiced by Chinatsu Akasaki the US candidate of the Heart Hybrid Gear had some development with her past and another minor character as well as her weaknesses in battle, Hauyuru Himekawa voiced by Juri Nagatsuma a moral committee member (quite ironic by the way) who also had some backstory to a failure that drives her to protect more people as well as the main male protagonist Hida Kizuna with his transference into the academy as well as his problems with his mother and the obvious development with his relationship to the Heart Hybrid Gear members. There is one more cast members involved in the main cast who is Sylvia Silkcut voiced by Hina Kino who helps Hida whenever she can and really she was the least developed *cough* character in the anime (though she does get some sweet upgrades in terms of HHG and &quot;some form of development&quot;). If there was a character LA liked in this anime, it would easily go to Hayuru as her mature yet tsundere personality and her even being a moral committee member becomes quite the irony for her, sure Aine has the better backstory and development and central focus but Hayuru was interesting for what screentime she was given. As for our main male protagonist Hida Kizuna, he actually isn&#039;t your typical dense main male protagonist and actually has a crux to the plot quite early in the anime and yes the obvious borderline-hentai scenes is more or less a by product as to WHY he&#039;s so important to the plot, but from his own problems with his own mother (which becomes a plot point later) to finding more about the HHG and making the plot more and more intense (NOT THAT WAY...Jesus LA is NOT intentionally making sexual innuendoes, it&#039;s just coming off like that) and driving the stakes of the plot further. Hida&#039;s obvious involvement with the other HHG members also adds to his development as an actually well-defined character albeit typical of the &quot;wants to protect everyone&quot; theme. For &quot;main male protagonist&quot; goes, he&#039;s actually pretty well done and from an excessively ecchi anime at that...what is this anime Highschool DxD &lt;LA laughs then slowly stops&gt;...<br />
<br />
The animation, done by Production IMS, is no stranger to the rather ecchi genre *cough* Shinmai Maou no Testament and really even though it is uncensored for the most part, the hentai scenes is &quot;ok&quot; at best and even though the animation derps here and there except in the hentai scenes, the background work and even the character designs do falter in it&#039;s animation derps, the fight scenes were ok at least but even the battles were struck with the janky animation, facial derps and off-handed vibrant yet blurry character palette to the dull backgrounds. The focus on the animation really went to the borderline-hentai scenes, as they were much more detailed and had less errors than the rest of the animation, it&#039;s kinda obvious where the focus Production IMS were looking at and LA really can&#039;t fault them in putting effort in the &quot;star attraction to this anime&quot;, BUT can for the rest of the animation derps scattered throughout the anime. The animation overall was nothing to talk about though...<br />
<br />
The voice acting, well for a borderline-hentai anime, you&#039;d think LA would be drooling over the &quot;great&quot; voice work, but in general, the voice cast just did decently fine across the board and LA really didn&#039;t have any problems with squeakiness either (yes even from Sylvia). LA&#039;s favorite voice actor?...well it&#039;s gonna be default but it&#039;s gonna be tie between Juri Nagatsuma who voiced Hayuru and Iori Nomizu who voiced Kei Shikina one of the central tech-hands of Amaterasu.<br />
<br />
The ending by all means gave...a mediocre final battle and sure it FINALLY tells us who Aine really is and really the two main fighters in the final battle is Hida and Aine with the rest of the HHG trying to have a psychological battle with their baggage that were previous plot points to each character...hmmm Sylvia didn&#039;t get one, LA wonders WHY. Ultimately due to the few janky animation moments it made the final battle felt mediocre, but thankfully the ending gave compensation by finally revealing Aine&#039;s mystery behind her, however with the few plot threads left dangling and even more questions being brought up after the aftermath of the final battle (and to be precise the final scenes), alludes to a second season?...an OVA?...the ending overall was ok and really LA kinda expected the &quot;read the manga-ish ending&quot; considering the missing plot threads not told yet with Hida&#039;s mother and the various villains still on stand-by, so LA expected this.<br />
<br />
Masou Gakuen HxH caters to two niches in the anime community for this kind of anime, those who want to see the &quot;ecchi more than the plot&quot; and those who REALLY wants to see an ecchi anime with &quot;actual plot&quot; like how Highschool DxD did before and more tamer than this and LA is squarely on both ends on this, it&#039;s disguised as a typical overblown ecchi fest but under it&#039;s layers it actually has some pretty decent plot to it and sure the animation falters in the battle scenes more than the ecchi scenes (yeah wonder why) but Masou Gakuen HxH is more or less an odd surprise for LA in the Summer 2016 lineup, ohh it&#039;s not the worst anime nor is it the &quot;best&quot;, but in terms of it&#039;s genre and what it caters to, then that&#039;s where it really does shine.

    Welcome to The Asterisk War, Fat Fucking Titties Edition.<br />
<br />
Oh, yeeeah. That&#039;s the good shit I want. Thanks to the creators for the Uncensored version. It&#039;s really solved my frustration over the fact that there are never any nipples in anime.<br />
<br />
This is a masterpiece. After all, what masterpiece doesn&#039;t start without a full minute and a half groping scene?<br />
<br />
Forget everything you know. This is the anime that changes lives, solves world hunger and cures cancer, thanks to its copious amounts of voluptous, bouncing, large, sizeable, monstrous, pillowy, soft...... plot. Niiiiiiiiice.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s no way this isn&#039;t a parody. If it isn&#039;t I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll lose some of my

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230622">
        sanity.<br />
<br />
Masou Gakuen HxH is a show full of everything that that is called &quot;cancerous&quot; in anime. Harem? Check. Male protagonist with the Phallus Of Fate? Check. Needless High School? Check. Ridiculous fanservice? Check. A show full of scenes so close to actual pornography that you wonder why they didn&#039;t just make this a hentai instead? Check, check, and check. This show wins the award for Thing I Most Don&#039;t Want To Explain To My Parents for this season. And yes, I&#039;m counting Shokugeki.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s not much to say about this show. There&#039;s big breasts, big robots, big boobs, big guns, and big bosoms. There&#039;s fingerbanging, and at one point mouth fingerbanging (I really don&#039;t think that&#039;s as sexy as they thought it would be. Kinda nasty, actually).<br />
<br />
It really is all very stupid. Whether that&#039;s intended or not, I don&#039;t know. I want to believe that the people who made this are smart enough to know how stupid this is and have made it this stupid on purpose. Because the stupidity is on a whole other level with this show.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m losing track of any points I want to make, so I&#039;ll stop here. I had some notes that I took to make sure I stayed on track, but all they say is &quot;Breasts aren&#039;t supposed to do that&quot;, and &quot;I wonder if they have special made bras to contain their monstrously sized sheilas&quot;.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not worth watching unless you really want to murder a few brain cells or just zone out to something you don&#039;t have to pay attention to.

    This anime is fucking dreadful. Pathetic even. Why? Because this is a fucking hentai. It&#039;s not even a fucking ecchi anymore. <br />
<br />
Here&#039;s a definition: &quot;Softcore hentai. Often includes panty-shots, nudity, or perverted situations. Almost always used for humor. Ecchi does not describe actual sex acts.&quot;<br />
Was this softcore hentai at all? I doubt it.<br />
<br />
For those that says that this anime is &quot;Rank No.1 Tier Ecchi&quot; or some shit. You gotta understand that this anime went too fucking far with its fanservice. To the point that it&#039;s not a fucking fanservice anymore. There are some screen where the MC actually rub some girl&#039;s vagina, girls climaxing when

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230623">
        they got molested, kiss with graphic tongues actions, and touch em private parts, etc. Just.... Keep that shit to hentai please.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s like taking a cam whore, or a cam girl from a porn website, and move those people of that site to fucking twitch, or a normal live stream sites. I mean yeah, hentai disguised as an anime will definitely get alot of attention (similar to those boob cams on twitch), plus more $ for them just because more perverts are there to watch them. Im not saying that i&#039;m against ecchi, but this anime is taking things too far.<br />
<br />
The horrible thing about these character in the series (except for the MC) is the girls with big titties. All of them literally have gigantic boob size, while some of the smaller one would get little to no screen time at all in each of the episodes. I guess that&#039;s just the author&#039;s preferences of his fantasies. And that being said, most of the girl behaviors, actions, personality, convenient character/personality/philosophy/beliefs/detest of sexual acts changes (black hair girl who&#039;s amongst the 3 main girls) really does make these girl looks so god fucking damn slutty as hell. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you just show my nude pics in front of every guy in school? I will just hit you with some shit, then we&#039;re cool. Coz you know, i want some of that molestation as well.&quot; Not gonna spoil but this is one of the scene that you should be expecting in the uncensored version.<br />
<br />
And btw, i watch the entire part of the series coz why not? This anime (should&#039;ve been animated as a hentai instead) spent most of its time on some shitty drama and romance that&#039;s cringey, and so easy to win as fuck man. Like holy shit, you&#039;re a stranger, and you&#039;re a pervert.<br />
Girl: &quot;i have a very sad life, but this guy says nice things to me just to sexually molested me. IM so fucking down into acting like a slut, or a bitch just to get em climaxes, and em power&quot;.<br />
<br />
The premise in itself is perfect for a hentai plot like that&#039;s for sure. You know hentai like Rance01? Yeah this anime is like that, there&#039;s some to little story (while spending 60% on fanservice, nudity, or even some real as hentai content etc.) but with no sex scene. But if the goal of this anime, in the sense of getting the absolute, fucking badass, highest power gain in this story. Having sex would&#039;ve been a way to fucking go when these women wants to feel sexual pleasure, or get naked right in front of our protagonist. <br />
<br />
But despite all the shit talking, this ecchi with an actual hentai content is a good prep for your fapping session on hentaiheaven.com, animestigma, hentaiplay.net, hentaigasm or some other shit in an actual hentai sites. I like dont know why you even bother watching an ecchi of this kind.

    I decided to put my overall in the beginning since people aren&#039;t going to read the whole review.  So just a summary would keep your attention long enough for me to get my points through.<br />
<br />
(7/10: MAL Standards &quot;Good&quot;) Overall: Masou Gakuen HxH isn&#039;t as bad as people say it is.  It&#039;s enjoyable with the right mindset and if you don&#039;t decide to hate it for what it is.  Give it a try.  Know that it&#039;s going to be a harem ecchi and know what you&#039;re going to get.  You&#039;ll leave feeling satisfied.  You may not be happy, you may

          <span style="display: none;" id="review232219">
        crave more, but you&#039;ll leave getting what you wanted.  A Harem Ecchi anime.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Apart from everyone overreacting, this anime is rather mediocre in everything except enjoyment.  I&#039;ll say this here and now, in my personal opinion, this is a fun show to watch.  A guilty pleasure.  It&#039;s enjoyable.  Try it out for yourself.  Watch it with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is.<br />
<br />
I like to start by saying that: This is indeed a harem-ecchi show with loads of fan service.  I personally do not care about that, but some other reviewers seem to and react accordingly.<br />
<br />
The art is rather plain compared to the gorgeous Hisasi art of the VN, but it&#039;s good.  Although, when I say good, I mean &quot;Anime Standard&quot;.<br />
<br />
The story, towards the end, is redeemable.  They&#039;re setting up a season 2.  It&#039;s interesting enough to keep you invested on a week to week basis, but it&#039;s nothing special.  It is worth watching though.  The premise is interesting once you get towards the 2nd half, things really turn up.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is boring.  Enough said.  It&#039;s forgettable and you&#039;ll hear the same battle theme over and over again.<br />
<br />
Characters are anime stereotypes and archetypes.  We have the tsundere, the onee-sama and...well...I don&#039;t know what Chidorigafugchi (or whatever her name is) is.  I suppose that makes it a good thing since she&#039;s part deredere and part tsundere and a few other things.  You&#039;ll know who is who.  They don&#039;t seem to grow (as usual) with the exception of Chidori who changes as the series progresses from being less cold hearted to something more...loveable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment is very subjective.  I FUCKING loved it.  But that&#039;s my own shit opinion.  If you go into this only knowing that it&#039;s going to be harem ecchi and that there&#039;s going to be a lot of it, then you&#039;re pretty much set for a good time.  It won&#039;t be &quot;10/10&quot; best anime of the year material, but it&#039;s going to be fun enough.<br />
<br />
I personally enjoyed it partially because of the harem ecchi but mostly because of how the characters interact with each other.  It may be predictable to you, but it&#039;s always fun to see it every season.  The story itself might have been dull to some, but I found it to be rather enjoyable for what it is.  It isn&#039;t DEEP, but it&#039;s interesting enough to keep you invested for 12 episodes.  Those 12 episodes aren&#039;t all too bad either.  Mostly 5/10s and 6/10s.  The amount of boobage is hilarious and is almost a meta genre in on itself.<br />

    This anime is really offensive, it portrays a male being objectified by all the women present, he is just a tool to satisfy their power supply needs. THESE WOMAN ARE ABUSING HIM, THIS IS ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING, HE SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO MAKE HIS OWN DECISION, I AM HIGHLY TRIGGERED, THIS ANIME SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF AIR RIGHT NOW! Oh and by the way, it´s a really generic show with boobs being the only highlight. I guess it has the borderline hentai scenes going for it, but even that is not really explored, since they want to keep it´s rating under 18+. The overwhelming amount

    this was my first anime that i watched on subbed. the plot is perfect and the story is good too this makes this worth a watch you must have heard about anime know as &quot;Infinite stratos&quot; if you liked that anime trust me you will love this. i was addicted to this anime just by watching the fist episode it got my attention and i finished the series just in one day. there is nothing to dislike in this anime <br />
however, <br />
the way it ended is really something else. on last episode a girl just comes out of nowhere and claims to be Chidorigafuchi&#039;s sister

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320962">
         and then it says<br />
to be continued....<br />
<br />
you cant just leave fans hanging like that and this gives us the hope for season 2 <br />
i say give this anime a try you will love this.

    Ill first state that if your not of excessive ecchi or a borderline hentai anime also with fetishes as well like fingerbanging and other stuff aswell please just dont watch otherwise ill get too it<br />
<br />
Story: so the story starts out with Kizuna who has a heart hybrid and when he gets too the school and meets Aine, Hayuru and Yurishia so for them too power up more he has too do a heart hybrid with them meaning doing sexual stuff like rubbing the good old vag and rubbing there tits while doing stuff that i stated about so they can defeat enemies i honestly dont

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230257">
        even remember there name honestly just man this anime had SO MUCH sexual stuff<br />
<br />
Art: art was very good detailing the nipples and everything else out aswell<br />
<br />
Sound: sound was very good had some good beats in some episodes of the anime <br />
<br />
Chracter: now i wont go too much into this as i enjoyed all the characters<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: now this is hard because i am a lewd person but MAN this anime has SO MUCH ECCHI its unbelievable how much is in this comedy was good and action was very good<br />
<br />
Overall: im giving this a 7 the anime did end a cliffhanger so that why another season is coming out but the ecchi is like WAY too much which im giving it a 7 for

    I&#039;ll review it in simple way:<br />
1. If you love ecchi, almost full nudity, didn&#039;t care about the story, and just need a &quot;material&quot;, this is for you, you probably will score it 10/10.<br />
2. But, If you love about story, easily bothered by &quot;what is this for?&quot; in the story, and only looking for a great story, turn away right now. But, you can still try to watch it, maybe it could be your taste, but, this is absolutely not my taste. Me, watch all of the episodes, irritated.<br />
<br />
Okay, that is all, I can write review for this anime very simple, because, yeah, it&#039;s not that

    Robot suits with super powers? Guy able to power up girls by having sexual relations with them and turning them into complete degenerate perverts?<br />
<br />
It&#039;s like it&#039;s 2011 again.<br />
<br />
Okay, so while the show does have it&#039;s ups and downs, I&#039;m trying to make this review into something that doesnt spoil too much for people who havent actually seen the show.<br />
<br />
Masou Gakuen HxH is basically a mixture of Infinite Stratos, HighSchool DxD and Shinmai Maou No Testament. While picking up stuff from other series to further elaborate their ideas is good and is actually the highest praise an artist could give to one another, failing to keep

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337413">
        said stuff in a form that allows the show to be enjoyable is something that this series really headbutted itself quite often.<br />
<br />
Story: While it takes a while for the story to really get going, it is in no way bad. After the last episode I immediately checked for season 2, manga version and even English translated novels, but with no avail. The series had this &quot;please buy the original work&quot; and &quot;if you want more read the novel&quot; look all over it straight from episode 1. Again, not bad, but if you&#039;re gonna do that, the ending has to be good enough to catch the viewers interest.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation: I had no problems with the art. While it did lack some certain much needed frames in critical moments, the animation picked up the slack and vice versa. The characters, if nothing else, were very beautiful and had very individualistic features. Some might even call them stereotypical designs, but why change something that has proven to work?<br />
One mention I will make though: The special effects frames were really, I mean REALLY BAD at one point in the series which made me replay it a couple times, but they were so well animated that I decided to let it slide.<br />
<br />
Sound: Nothing special that stood out, maybe could have done a bit more variety on the combat sounds.<br />
<br />
Characters: I said that the characters were, if nothing else, beautiful. That&#039;s it, they were exactly that. No memorable backstories, no secret sides, no deeper understandings or hidden feelings. The only character that had even a little bit of an interesting build is Aine, but other than that...mildly dissapointing. Top layer personalities were fine, but they just left me with this feeling of wanting to see more, but &quot;more&quot; never came.<br />
<br />
Still, overall it was entertaining but the execution could have been done better. Some rebuild to the story, a better world build in the beginning and giving the characters more time and space to develop would have done wonders to this series. If there ever will be a 2nd season, I will check it out, but I&#039;m not holding my hopes up seeing the ratings.

    tl;dr: Lacking in a number of areas but decently pretty successful at what it seems it set out to do. <br />
<br />
This show is pretty straightforward in what it is and whether it&#039;s your thing or not, it is what it is, take it or leave it. And in terms of that I think it did a reasonably solid job. In terms of the story, the first half was pretty slow, by which I mean not in terms of the adaptation being slow, but rather while the adaptation did have events happening at a reasonable the events themselves moved things forward very slowly. It also seemed to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331347">
        dwell on the awkwardness of everything more than necessary. It definitely picks up during the second half though and also gets over its awkwardness making it more enjoyable. The ending especially seems to be getting quite interesting, but it then rushes an ending that while at the grand scale you would expect from a finale, doesn’t quite feel like a complete ending with how close to the end the climax is, and how it leads right into a cliffhanger that’ll never get an animated continuation. In terms of characters’ the biggest problem is the protagonist, in that he’s pretty lame and useless throughout. He has flashes of greater competence, so it’s not like he’s completely useless really, but rather that plot rarely lets him do anything of value beyond boosting others. His personality is also pretty flat and overtly dramatic at times. The heroines were pretty solid though, in that though they have pretty basic character arcs, they felt solid enough for how far the show ran. The action was decent, but also pretty random. Though the sheer randomness was pretty awesome at times. The comedy was also pretty solid. <br />
<br />
The animation was incredibly mixed, but for the most part it felt like the parts that really mattered were animated pretty well, while the parts that weren’t that important dropped down to quite terrible with various levels in between. The art and character designs were great though. The CG was just good enough not to be a major issue but I wouldn’t call it good exactly. The soundtrack was surprisingly good. The OP was decent and the minor version differences in visuals were interesting. The ED was pretty good and very fitting.

    STORY: Cool action scenes, very funny, when they henshi -- it reminds me of Sailor Moon &amp; FAN SERVICE. When they power up with Eros --- it&#039;s really weird and uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: <br />
	• Kizuna-san: only guy on the team, his battlizer - Eros. Can be seen as a pervert. But is very kind and caring. Has a sister -- commander.<br />
	• Aine: Very serious -- gradually sees her softer side after she powered up with Eros. One of her well-known weapons is the Pulverizer.<br />
	• Yurishia: Has long, blonde hair. She was skeptical of Kizuna at first due to his reputation until she powered-up. Since then, she wants

          <span style="display: none;" id="review231510">
        to have more since -_-&quot;.<br />
	• Hayuru: Ace, part of the morals committee -- RATED PG, hated Kizuna due to his reputation, after teaming up with him, she doesn’t hate him as much. Her battlizer looks like a nursing outfit. <br />
	• Silvia: Short blonde hair, very cute, under the command of Kizuna, very kind, usually is behind the scenes back at headquarters.<br />
<br />
Overall: Good anime, BUT it&#039;s very pervy -- reminds me of porn. Similar to Hundred and High School DxD. This anime IS NOT suited for younger viewers!<br />

    Masou Gakuen HxH is an anime that made me get up in the middle of the night to write a review on. That could be good or bad.<br />
<br />
If you are looking for a sterotypical ecchi battle harem, this is not for you. First of all, none of the main girls are redheads. On a more serious note, has way more fanservice than your typical battle harem, so take caution. If you are looking for fanservice, then I would consider watching this anime.<br />
<br />
First up, the plot. Who on Earth put a story in my softcore hentai? Instead of being an anime with ecchi elements, it feels

          <span style="display: none;" id="review244690">
        like borderline hentai with an out of place story shoved in it.<br />
<br />
Notice how I used &quot;hentai.&quot; Exactly. This show goes way to far with it&#039;s fanservice. Without being too explicit about what happens, let&#039;s just say this. While many ecchi shows can be passed with a E for everybody, Masou Gakuen HxH takes the E rating and moves it past F and G all the way to H. H for hentai.<br />
<br />
Looking at the story, there is potential. Inter-dimensional war between Earth, and the baddies, with Earth on the losing side. Teenage boy shows up at an academy for training mech users. Most of humanity on the mainland is extinct. All this points to a decent sounding story. Similar premise to Aldnoah.Zero.<br />
<br />
However, fanservice is thrust into the viewer&#039;s face faster than they can comprehend the plot. The immense fanservice overwhelms the story, and the story itself wasn&#039;t executed too well. This waters down what remains of the story into an incoherent mess. Especially when they thrust a scene at you, then only to reveal that the scene was either from the past or from the future for some odd reason, and it has little to no relation to what is happening in the present.<br />
<br />
The story feels like a buffet dish after someone used the wrong spoon to scoop from. There are bits and pieces of other things mixed in, but you know in general what this is supposed to be. You don&#039;t necessarily like it either.<br />
<br />
Story: 4/10<br />
<br />
Normally, I don&#039;t judge too harshly on art, because I simply am not cultured enough to be able to differentiate good art and bad. What I can notice is inconsistency.<br />
<br />
In HxH, one scene can look perfectly fine, and then the next scene can look abnormal. Poorly drawn faces, etc. A big issue here is some of the character&#039;s breasts. They can look perfectly normal for a few scenes, then look like watermelons taped onto a person in the next.<br />
<br />
Art: 4/10<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t usually critique sound harshly either, but I&#039;ll have to take points off here because I can&#039;t deal with the porn music.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, the music for the... almost hentai scenes do not fit at all. It isn&#039;t soothing and calm enough to make you think the characters are truly happy and making love. It isn&#039;t sensual enough to make you feel the atmosphere either. It feels out of place.<br />
<br />
Imagine that you are trying to concentrate. At school or at work. Then someone lets out the nastiest fart next to you. You can live with it. But it sucks. That&#039;s how the music felt to me.<br />
<br />
Your mileage may vary here. Just like how some people like farts, some people find the mismatched music funny.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
<br />
Characters. The story is about a guy who touches women to give them power ups. There need not be proper characters. However. Let me just say this. However. When you do choose to give a bit of character to your rather bland cast, please for the love of all you hold dear, do it properly. Or at least try to.<br />
<br />
Kizuna is our wonderful bland harem protagonist that somehow manages to get a harem all the while having all the girls outside of his harem flee from him like medieval townsfolk from the plague. He has his moments of greatness, then breaks the pedestal we put him on. Namely when he says something meaningful to solve a girl&#039;s problem, then fanservice ensues.<br />
<br />
The three main girls. All have passably distinct personalities. That&#039;s okay. What isn&#039;t okay is how they develop through the story. Their problems don&#039;t feel like they are persistent. What I mean is that each episode, we have a short scene/flashback about someone&#039;s personal issues, and that very same episode (or if we&#039;re lucky, the next one) it gets solved by our main boy. Of course, being borderline softcore hentai, we forget about these moments after the next few minutes of... fanservice. It&#039;s not too much of a sex scene, no matter how much innuendos there are. Just lots of touching, feeling, and licking.<br />
<br />
Sylvia. The cute little loli angel child who is in charge of guiding our main character. I suppose that she is meant to be a middle-schooler, but being a loli, she is literally half of our main boy&#039;s height. This isn&#039;t much of a spoiler, as any anime watcher worth their salt knows what will happen, but our angel child gets lewded. Thankfully they just cut to the very end and didn&#039;t show anything. It would have hurt me to watch that. But hey, different strokes for different folks. Just because I&#039;m not into it doesn&#039;t mean other people aren&#039;t. The problem I have here is that it goes from 0 to 100 very quickly.<br />
<br />
Characters: 3/10<br />
<br />
Overall, I feel that this anime is okay, as far as my expectations go. I heard about it, expected some ecchi, but got the bare bones of an actual story along side some softcore hentai. The tone of the anime varies a bit too much. Jumping from typical battle school to super deep conversation to near sex. With the fluctuating tones, I could not bring myself to enjoy this anime as much as I enjoyed others. The abrupt changes in tone made me sit back and think: &quot;Why am I watching this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5/10<br />
<br />
Lastly, my opinion, going by tags.<br />
<br />
This is tagged as &quot;action,&quot; but the only noteworthy action I see is some mildly intense boy on girl action, with the occasional firing of ion cannons.<br />
<br />
Tagged &quot;comedy,&quot; but it&#039;s not very funny. You know, other than how it comically fails at everything else it does.<br />
<br />
Tagged &quot;romance,&quot; but as far as I can see it&#039;s not very romantic.<br />
<br />
Tagged &quot;school,&quot; but the only thing that makes it school-related is that the story takes place in one. I don&#039;t remember a single classroom scene with a teacher lecturing.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s watchable. Watchable as in you won&#039;t die watching it.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4/10

    Truly a masterpiece. Gets the blood pumping. Shows tons of good character and personality trait. All the characters have a really deep backstory and it grows. I like to think of them as my second family. As I am typing this I just order the body pillow, for scientific research. I can&#039;t recommend this anime enough, the only slight downside I can think of is that the art style changes very slightly. The later episodes have absolutely astounding art, incredibly detailed and intricate. When it comes to entertainment, one of the easiest things to get wrong is the concept of the female. Part of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376064">
        reason for this is because our scientific understanding of &quot;girls&quot; is still in its infancy, and this means that the writers for shows like Doctor Who, Quantum Leap, even Star Trek, must apply their imagination and creativity in order to resolve some of the inherent paradoxes that will occur whenever a narrative decides to hop, skip or jump.

    I would not recommend this to ANY person ever.<br />
<br />
Here is why the story is bad in alot of way. One of which that it is very hard to follow because the story makes alot of jumpcuts. Its not easy to follow by just casually watching the anime.<br />
<br />
The art is oke, its basic but it&#039;s nice and feels close to home because alot of other anime use the same style. The bad part is the weird looking 3D models of robots.<br />
<br />
Sound is good, I also don&#039;t know how you could mess this part up, there is alot of mouning girls ;p<br />
<br />
characters are bad. Anime makes it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review353282">
        so different character have different hair colour which is usefull so you quickly know who this girl is, but in the anime there are characters who have a similar body type and the same hair colour and it gets you of the whole story and you need to think: &quot;who is this again?&quot; The character arch is weird the episode before this person was weak and a day after she is in the biggest battle they had in the whole show and still the person is keeping up with everbody else who are the best in the world.<br />
<br />
there was not alot of enjoyment in this anime every time the opening start I just want to watch some youtube and then I force myself to finish the show and it did happen but man it was a struggle for me.<br />
<br />
So overall its like a 3 and that&#039;s me being generous. It isn&#039;t a good show and all the good stuff is the erotic stuff happening in the anime. <br />
<br />
PLZ send a friend request I don&#039;t have any :(<br />

    Oh this show, where to begin. I guess first off this is a very ecchi show, the censored version anyway (which is what Crunchyroll has), uncensored it&#039;s pretty much hentai (especially the six specials that came with the Blu-ray release). Like The Testament of Sister New Devil there is a paper thin plot that serves as an excuse to have the MC sexually arouse his harem of team mates so they can &quot;power up&quot; (the scenes of which are so awkward they&#039;re actually kind of humerous, or at least I thought so. Whoa to any poor girl who would actually date an otaku who watched

          <span style="display: none;" id="review348702">
        this for pointers on how to &quot;pleasure&quot; a woman LOL) and fight the CGI mecha bad guys (and bad scantily clad girls). When not fighting or &quot;powering up&quot; it&#039;s typical harem comedy school stuff, all pretty much by the numbers. Surprisingly by the end the plot actually becomes interesting enough I somehow cared what happens next. (basic plot beings from another dimension takes over the planet with a small percentage of people building floating armored islands protected by fighters in their &quot;hybrid gear&quot; with a focus on the top fighters, girls outfits are less than a bikini covered in armor whereas guys get full body suits , only girls are top fighters with the MC being the only boy who can power them up due to his mysterious mother who was a lead researcher that developed the technology and then disappeared).<br />
Based on LNs the 12 episode show ends at the halfway point just when some of the mysteries start being revealed (as usual all is not what it seems). A second season was announced but never made as the animation studio went bankrupt (though a few scenes are well animated the animation is pretty mediocre overall) and Funimation licensed the show but cancelled the release for some reason (some of the loli scenes would be my guess). It&#039;s too bad the character designs went so over the top (especially in the boob department, the &quot;smaller&quot; chested Japanese girl is even a DD so the busty American blonde&#039;s boobs are HHH or whatever unrealistic size they are supposed to be to make hers appear &quot;small&quot; by comparison) the LN covers are pretty nice by comparison.<br />
<br />
Can&#039;t really recommend this, it is what it is so you know what you&#039;re getting into. There&#039;s way better actual hentai and pure fighting shows if that&#039;s what you are looking for, though I guess the ecchi, unintentional humor, and even the ridiculous plot will probably keep you interested enough to make it through the whole thing. (CR like I said has the edited version, but a quick Google search will show you what you&#039;re missing  )<br />
Chinatsu Akasaki&#039;s English &quot;WOW&quot; (she plays the blonde American) was the highlight of the show for me.<br />
