    I&#039;m writing this review because I just don&#039;t understand the score that this show gets. At the moment it&#039;s less than a 6 on MAL.<br />
<br />
The author who wrote this is the same as Hitman Reborn and I read the manga for this anime myself so I can say it gets a little better later on. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s not by any chance a bad anime, I&#039;ll put it as average and up at best. We have a typical shounen lead who&#039;s shy and useless but gets powerful sooner or later and a tsundere female lead. We get some character development but it&#039;s just the starting arc at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239496">
        the moment so I&#039;ll let it slide. <br />
<br />
We have a few characters not introduced yet and the story hasn&#039;t progressed that far yet so only time will tell how much the story grow.<br />
<br />
TLDR: elDLIVE is not a bad anime so give it a chance. It&#039;s not a waste of time like other anime. DO NOT HOWEVER COMPARE this work to Hitman Reborn although they have the same author.  By MAL user standards this show would be a 7.3 above I guess<br />
<br />

    Okay, so I started with this series because I was such a big fan of Akira Amano&#039;s previous work, &quot;Katekyo Hitman Reborn!&quot; and because I just randomly bumped into the teaser of the anime on Facebook. With all honesty, the series peaked at my interest as soon as I saw the trailer (which is actually the main reason why I also started reading the manga as soon as it says &quot;From the author of Katekyo Hitman Reborn!&quot;)<br />
<br />
Anyways, the story is a bit slow in pace but I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s going to go in the right direction (I&#039;m also up to date with the manga

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239022">
        so I know that much). Give the anime a few more episodes before you think that it&#039;s crappy. You&#039;ll have to go deeper into the storyline in order to know what the hell happened with each character.<br />
<br />
The art is well-done. Just the way I like my steak. You have two cute mascot aliens there, by the way.<br />
<br />
Kidding aside, the OST was well-chosen. I personally love the ending song, &quot;Kimi no Koe ga.... (キミノコエガ…。)&quot; by The Super Ball. Would listen to it any day. As for the opening, I thank the prods for putting two hot guys beside each other namely, Captain Laine Brick and Dr. Love. Thank you! Really!<br />
<br />
Okay, so the main character that we have here (once again) is a wimp that will be developing his balls to fight soon enough. And he has this crush on the heroine who doesn&#039;t even want to acknowledge him and is still spouting harsh comments at him. She just might be a tsundere. I bet my life on it. We have two cute aliens that I would want as stuff toys for my bed room. And a hottie for a captain of the space police ship. Most of the characters are practically a brooding ground of secrets. Would love to write more about them but I don&#039;t really want to spoil.<br />
<br />
A bit slow-paced but I still find it enjoyable in a way. I can&#039;t possibly drop the series, though. No way can I ever do that. I mean, the first time that I finally saw Laine Brick animated, I was already brimming with joy.<br />
<br />
Overall rating is 8. (Breakdown: Story-8, Art-9, Sound-9, Character-7, Enjoyment-7) Give this series a chance, guys. Seriously. KHR had a slow pace as well. We might be getting the same for this series. Anyways, I still want to see more of what&#039;s about to happen so I&#039;m giving this a go.<br />
<br />
P.S. Yes, we have KHR easter eggs, too. Enjoy!

    Seeing how its rating isn&#039;t exactly high, I thought I needed to justify just how good (or bad) this series actually is. <br />
<br />
As most of you reading this might already know, this series was written by the very same author who brought us Katekyo Hitman Reborn. However, going into this series thinking and expecting it to match the quality of Reborn isn&#039;t the way to go. <br />
<br />
elDLIVE is really just a simple, shounen series with not much complications regarding the plot or characters. Almost everything about it is as straightforward as it can get or, as some people would call it, predictable. But this doesn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243643">
        necessarily mean it&#039;s not worth a watch, though. Despite the simple plot line, the episodes have a good flow to them and usually have a sense of continuity between them. This gives you the feeling on wanting/needing to watch on to find out what happens next, which I thought they pulled off decently well. Overall the series didn&#039;t feel that rushed, although I thought the ending did fall victim to that a bit. That said, the series ended on a decent note and was quite open, although I highly doubt a second season would come but it definitely has made room for a possibility. <br />
<br />
The art isn&#039;t exactly extravagant, but it&#039;s appealing enough to make watching it comfortable. Simple art for a simple story. Because this series featured aliens and similar life-forms, character designs were rather interesting for this one. When I first saw him I seriously thought Chips looked an awful lot like Manaphy (Yes, the Pokemon). There&#039;s also a cat girl, a talking muscular crescent moon... It was just fascinating to see really weird characters all around. And also, not to mention the main girls (Misuzu, Veronica, Nina) actually looked pretty cute too.<br />
<br />
If anything, the soundtrack of this series has to be one of its highlights for me. The OST composer is none other than Yasuharu Takanashi, who is the same guy who brought to you the soundtracks of Fairy Tail and Naruto Shippuden. So yes, great and familiar shounen music to accompany this series really worked well for me. Battle themes during the action, and slow emotional pieces during supposedly sad moments; it all fit well. They also had, in my opinion, one of the best EDs of the season. Not just in terms of music, but the animation during the ED was simply beautiful. Even if you don&#039;t plan to watch this series, I&#039;d recommend you to just watch that ED. <br />
<br />
If you had watched the PV, you&#039;d have known that our protagonist Chuta had a terrible incident happen to him when he was young, and had been traumatized by it ever since. And then you&#039;d think, a coward like him... becomes a space police officer?! Indeed, most of the series focuses on the growth of Chuta as a person. How he attempts to overcome his past fears, how he convinces himself that he is not actually a useless dimwit who always runs away in the face of adversity... through these 12 episodes you will see him change his perceptions. There are hardly any characters in this show who are worthy of being disliked (even the villains, because they hardly did anything horrible). Even though the focus is mainly on Chuta, Dolugh and Misuzu, over this series we are also wll introduced to the side characters like Veronica, Nina and Dr. Love. I particularly like Dr. Love&#039;s character, but that&#039;s just how I feel of course. Maybe you&#039;ll think differently of him... Seriously, though, which a rather huge cast it was always going to be hard to give every single character decent development, and I thought what they pulled off in 12 episodes was adequate for one to enjoy the show. <br />
<br />
I actually really enjoyed this show over the course of the last 12 weeks. This was something I looked forward to at the start of every week. Right from the start, this series was never meant to be a super serious one. There was never going to be brutalities or cruelties. It&#039;s simply a light-hearted shounen series. If what you&#039;re looking for is a simple series which doesn&#039;t have a complicated plot, features decent action sequences and has a great soundtrack, then elDLIVE could be one for you. <br />
<br />
YOYOSA!

    How I made it to the end... I wonder... <br />
Okay, I&#039;ll tell you. <br />
Why I even begin to watch it? I&#039;ve watched Reborn series in the past. I didn&#039;t like it. Once again, why I even begin to watch ēlDLIVE? Ah, yes, I know. That&#039;s because I&#039;m very kind soul who&#039;s inclined to give people second chances so they can show they&#039;ve became better. Yup. I gave such chance to the author. (Hope you would believe) <br />
<br />
The story is so unique! It doesn&#039;t resemble Reborn&#039;s story in any possible way. <br />
Small chibi creature that helps main hero? No way you would find something so overused

          <span style="display: none;" id="review244161">
        here!<br />
Non-confident main character who&#039;s the most kind and caring character ever? Nope, nope, wrong call! <br />
Some big organisations brawling with each other? Not here, nope! <br />
Bishie characters popping up here and there? Not happening again! <br />
<br />
Art and sound are pretty mediocre. Nothing special save my admiration for the author&#039;s infinite capabilites at creating so various bishie characters which you wouldn&#039;t confuse with anyone else(you would, believe me)<br />
<br />
Characters are outstanding, as you could already figured out from everything written above. Tsun... oh, sorry, I meant Chuuta is the great example to follow. Just do nothing, be no one, and then and only then some day would come for you to shine! <br />
Haven&#039;t you understood the deep idea of monitalien? Everyone has infinite powers within! You just have to believe in yourself! <br />
Oh, and I haven&#039;t seen such cute girl as Sonokata for a long while. She&#039;s the one of the main characters.  Prepare for a surprise. Know what? <br />
She&#039;s... is... tsundere. Unbelievable, right?! <br />
<br />
Had a lot enjoyment. Plot twists are unpredictable, characters are unique, everything&#039;s brilliant to keep it short. And I ain&#039;t sarcastic right now. (I am, okay)<br />
<br />
Recommended to everyone who liked Reborn and seeks for something similar. <br />
<br />
All right, that&#039;s how you should not make shonens. <br />

    elDLIVE is based off the popular manga of the same name and is an action/ science fiction genre based anime. I have yet to read the source material that the anime is based on but after seeing how enjoyable this anime was I might consider reading it.<br />
<br />
Story and setting <br />
The story of elDLIVE revolves around the life of Chuuta Kokonose a fourteen-year-old middle school boy that one day was found himself face to face with an alien and is recruited into an intergalactic police force called elDLIVE. <br />
<br />
The story of elDLIVE revolves around Chuuta’s life as a middle school student as well as his career

          <span style="display: none;" id="review244229">
        as an officer of the intergalactic force elDLIVE as he and his fellow officers work tirelessly to protect the planet from all sorts of aliens and invasions. For the most part the anime is largely set on the planet Earth to which Chuuta and his friends and fellow officers reside however the series does also take place on the large mobile HQ that is used as a command ship by the solar system bureau that Chuuta belongs to. <br />
In terms of story the idea of the main character being chosen to join a mysterious intergalactic police force that was unknown to them by the merit of the abilities that they never know that they had certainly was intriguing. The fact this force’s HQ was a mobile command ship that was located just over Earth was also another surprise. Arguably one of the more interesting aspects of the story was that Chuuta gets the chance to not just meet many different alien species but also to work with many of them as part of his career in elDLIVE. The fact that many of these aliens look like normal human beings was even more surprising. <br />
<br />
Chuuta <br />
<br />
Chuuta voiced by veteran voice actor Ayumu Murase is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A 14-year-old second year middle school student Chuuta is an honest, hardworking and diligent person that tries to do his best in everything that he does. A firm believer in justice and second chances Chuuta prefers to use diplomacy to deal with cases rather than physical force. Since he was little Chuuta has been hearing voices in his head which eventually culminated in a rather tragic accident that had a long-lasting effect on his personality. However, this voice eventually become something that Chuuta never expected it to be and become one of the primary reasons as to why Chuuta was chosen by join the intergalactic police force elDLIVE. Personality wise Chuuta’s personality changes as the series progresses and his character is developed and improved upon after overcoming challenges both in life and with powerful adversaries. In the beginning Chuuta was an average teenager that got scared easily and was reluctant to be part of something that they did not understand or believe. <br />
<br />
However, as the series progressed and Chuuta and his partner drew got more involved with elDLIVE and solved more cases Chuuta become braver, smarter and more willing to stand up to adversaries no matter how powerful in order to protect his friends and innocents that may have been caught in the crossfire. Chuuta also become rather good at performing investigations on his own being able to talk to potential witnesses calmly and kindly and trying to sympathize with them for the effects that the crime has had on them rather than asking them straight out. One notable trait of Chuuta is that he cares a great deal about the people around him whether they are friends or just people that he had just met and as a result Chuuta will always try his utmost to protect them even if it meant sacrificing himself for them. <br />
<br />
All in all, I felt that Chuuta was a pretty good character as despite the weird situation that he found himself in he was able to adapt to the situation relatively quickly and from there slowly become both a better person and a capable officer within elDLIVE. Character development for Chuuta I felt was done reasonably well and it was nice to see him slowly get braver and become a better person as he gains experience from getting involved in cases. I felt that Ayumu Murase did a pretty good job portraying Chuuta. <br />
<br />
Misuzu <br />
<br />
Misuzu voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami of Owari no seraph and the irregular at magic high school fame is one of the main characters of the series and the main heroine of the series. A fellow classmate of Chuuta’s and a fellow officer of Chuuta within elDLIVE Misuzu was sent to Chuuta’s school to observe him and judge whether he is appropriate for service in elDLIVE. Misuzu is a pretty, intelligent and hard working person and takes her job as a elDLIVE officer seriously. Personality wise Misuzu undergoes many changes as the series progresses though unlike Chuuta her personality can be considered to be the opposite. In the beginning Misuzu’s personality is cold, aloof and distant only interacting with those that she considers friends and viewing others with contempt. Her relationship with Chuuta at first was not the best first impression as she did not think that he was suitable for being an officer as she felt that he did not take the matter seriously and that he was rather childish in his personality. However, as the series goes on and after seeing how much that Chuuta has changed both in terms of personality and in nature Misuzu’s opinion of him started to change.<br />
<br />
 It’s not until one of the later story arcs that Misuzu’s opinion of him progressed to a point when she was finally able to place her full trust in him and accept him as a fellow officer of elDLIVE. The interactions between Misuzu and Chuuta I felt was well done as because they are both within the same division they more often than not are assigned cases in which they must work together to solve. In these interactions, we get to see not just how she investigates and deal with cases but also how she learns from Chuuta that she doesn’t hold in high esteem at first. More importantly we also get to see how Misuzu’s opinions of Chuuta change as she sees how much he has matured both in personality and in attitude.  As with all members of elDLIVE Misuzu has powers of her own that are derived from the power of SPH which in Misuzu’s case takes the form of an angel like figure complete with wings. This form is only used when a peaceful arrest is no longer possible and really is a sight to see when she uses it. Overall I felt that Misuzu was a well-designed character and I liked how her opinion of Chuuta that she dismissed and loathed at first managed to change so much over the series in reflection of Chuuta’s own advancement and it was nice to finally see and hear Misuzu say to Chuuta that she now accepts him as a fellow officer. I felt that Saori Hayami did a excellent job portraying Misuzu. <br />
<br />
Veronica<br />
Veronica voiced by veteran seiyuu and actress Riho Iida is one of the main support characters of the show. A fellow elDLIVE officer and a friend to both Misuzu and Chuuta Veronica is an criminal investigation assistant inspector and is the head of her own division within elDLIVE’s CID division. Personality wise Veronica is a hot headed, blunt and rather competitive with fellow officers especially to Misuzu. However, while certainly aggressive at times Veronica takes her duties as an officer of elDLIVE seriously and in a way, she is similar to Misuzu in terms of attitude. Despite being aggressive Veronica as bereft of her rank and also as the commander of her division is not an idiot as people might assume from her personality and can be surprisingly inquisitive and fast thinking able to quickly ascertain what had happened at a scene or get to the heart of the matter without having to muddle through useless chatter. As can be expected from a division commander Veronica is one of the show’s most capable combatants with her combat style emphasizing her long legs which means that her kicks are relatively powerful. Her style especially makes use of a number of acrobatic moves that considering her normal clothing that consists of a miniskirt does tend to make male combatants get distracted which is probably why Veronica uses it in the first place. Like Misuzu Veronica’s attitude and opinion of Chuuta changes as the series goes on with her being curious about Chuuta when they first met but later accepting him as a result of a rather large operation/battle in which he managed to get both her and Nina out and solving the case more or less by himself. I felt Veronica was a pretty well designed character and I liked the interactions that she has with Misuzu. <br />
<br />
<br />
Nina <br />
<br />
Nina voiced by veteran seiyuu Lynn of High school fleet and Fuuka fame is one of the main support characters of the show and is a fellow elDLIVE officer that assist Misuzu and Chuuta. A member of Nina’s Division 5 of elDLIVE’s CID division Nina also serves as Veronica’s partner after they were assigned to the solar system bureau. Unlike Veronica who has a rather aggressive and blunt attitude towards investigations and to others Nina is the opposite in that she is kind, soft spoken and has a caring personality. Nina, Veronica and Misuzu are old friends having all joined elDLIVE around the same time and as a result she is well aware that the two often clash on a number of things when they encounter each other. As a result, Nina often finds herself pressed into the role of a peacekeeper as she tries to stop these arguments. Of the pair between Veronica and herself Nina can be best described as the intelligent and rational one and she often admonishes Veronica when she gets too hot headed and aggressive during operations.  Like all members of elDLIVE Nina also has her own abilities that she derives from her SPH which in her case takes the form of wind funnels that she can use to attack enemies with. Although not one to attack first in a combat situation Nina is no less a capable combatant than Veronica is and is capable of holding her own in a fight. <br />
<br />
As a side result of her SPH powers Nina’s outfit that she changes into when she uses her powers changes into a rather revealing outfit which is a contrast to her personality. This usually causes Nina to become embarrassed when others especially Chuuta sees it which I found to be rather amusing. Like Veronica Nina did not bear any special feelings towards Chuuta at first as she like her boss was curious of the special rookie that was in the bureau that they had heard about even outside of the system. Like Veronica Nina’s attitude towards Chuuta changes and she eventually treats him like a fellow officer. I felt that Lynn did a pretty good job voicing Nina.   <br />
<br />
Dolough <br />
Dolough voiced by veteran seiyuu Rie Kugimiya of Nabari no Ou and Full metal alchemist brotherhood fame is one of the main characters of the show. An alien of the rare Monitalien race Dolough serves as Chuuta’s SPH organ and thus forms a symbiosis relationship with Chuuta as they both need to exist for the other to live. Having grown up alongside Chuuta Dolough is perhaps Chuuta’s oldest friend and understands the pain and hardship that he has gone through in life which actually is a side effect of having Dolough living inside him. The relationship between Dolough and Chuuta is one of the main parts of the show and arguably the most important relationship that he has. As a result of their rather unique relationship Dolough relies on the good feelings and emotions that Chuuta feels and experiences in order to maintain his form and be able to use his SPH powers to help Chuuta. As a result, if Chuuta for whatever reason begins to feel negative feelings like anger, regret and others then Dolough would start to lose his form. While the bond between the two did not start off under the best of circumstances the bond that they forged soon began to improve as their relationship improved as the series went on improving not just Chuuta’s personality but also Dolough’s as well. Personality wise Dolough is a curious and inquisitive creature that can be described as being similar to someone of Chuuta’s age group. Dolough can also be surprisingly insightful being able to offer some valuable advice to Chuuta when needed. The bond and relationship that Chuuta establishes with Dolough I felt was done pretty well with both characters being developed as their bond improves. <br />
<br />
One aspect of their relationship that I felt was funny was how Dolough and Chuuta make use of each other in attacks. In this case Chuuta actually visualizes the attack that he will use and passes this to Dolough through the link and allowing him to launch that attack. This I felt was a great use of the symbiosis relationship that the two have. Overall I felt that Rie Kugimiya did a pretty good job voicing the character of Dolough. <br />
<br />
<br />
Laine <br />
<br />
Laine voiced by veteran voice actor Tatsuhisa Suzuki of Owari no seraph fame is one of the main support characters of the show. The commander of the solar system bureau of elDLIVE and Chuuta, Misuzu and Veronica and Nina’s commanding officer Laine is a laid back, carefree and friendly person that nonetheless has great faith in his subordinates and allows them to pursue their investigations if they can be proven to be important. At first glance Laine may appear to be a lazy and carefree person that doesn’t take his role as branch commander seriously however beneath this exterior self-Laine is actually a smart, quick thinking person that can be quite scheming but not quite manipulative. He’s also shown to have a good grasp of both military tactics and space warfare tactics which is surprising from him. Despite his laid-back nature, Laine is not one that will give up easily and even when confronted by the most powerful of enemies or the most hopeless of situations Laine will always try the best way to get through it with the end result always surprising to both allies and enemies alike. I felt that Laine was a pretty well designed character that both cared about his subordinates and also considers the larger picture and his keen strategic mind was really a surprise to me. I felt that Tatsuhisa Suzuki did a pretty good job voicing the character of Laine. <br />
<br />
<br />
Arts and animation <br />
In terms of art I felt that the environments that were shown in the series was well designed and colored and that there was a good variety of environments that the cast were featured in. The design for the bureau’s flagship and headquarters I though was pretty well done as the ship while not appearing to look like a warship had the firepower of a cruiser which I felt was important given that their role was to arrest criminals and enforce the law and not destroy them. The designs for the various alien species that were present in the show I felt was also another point that deserved praise as there was a large variety of aliens that were both beautifully designed and unique enough to stand out from among the others. <br />
In terms of character design, I felt that the series did a reasonable job as each character was alike in terms of uniform but at the same subtlety different in their own ways. One aspect of character design that I liked was the design of the uniforms that the members of elDLIVE wore for their day to day duties. In terms of animation I felt that it was crisp and clear and that the fight scenes both in terms of personal combat between the elDLIVE members and aliens and combat between spaceships was pretty well done. In particular, I liked the transformation scenes that happen as elDLIVE members activate their SPH abilities.  <br />
<br />
Music <br />
<br />
The music for the series I felt was particularly strong with both the opening and the ending themes being especially good. Scene music also felt appropriate as well. <br />
<br />
Voice acting <br />
<br />
The voice acting for the series I felt was pretty strong with Saori Hayami and Ayumu Murase who voiced the characters of Misuzu and Chuuta deserving some praise as I felt that they were able to portray their respective characters pretty well. I also felt that Rie Kugimiya, Lynn and Riho Iida who voiced the characters of Dolough, Nina and Veronica also did a great job portraying their respective characters. <br />
<br />
Overall conclusion <br />
<br />
Overall I felt that elDLIVE was a pretty well done and designed anime that had a great story, an interesting setting, well designed characters and solid voice acting. The premise that a middle school boy that had an alien inside of him being given the chance to join an intergalactic police force was certainly interesting. The subject area which in this case is to become a part of the intergalactic police force as an officer and from there protect the lives of not just normal human beings but also the lives of the aliens that have also made a home for themselves on earth was also interesting. In terms of story I liked how at first it made use of the normal villain of the week formula that is common to most animes and manga before slowly getting more serious as the villains become more apparent and powerful eventually culminating in their appearance near the mid part of the series. This type of slowly feeding in the main villains into the main plot was well designed move as introducing them too quickly would make the anime sound rushed and lower the dread that the characters would feel when they are confronted with them. <br />
<br />
Character design and character development for the series I felt was pretty well done with the best examples of the former being the Chuuta, Misuzu and Nina and the latter being the personalities of both Chuuta and Misuzu and the emerging bond that the two forge as they began to accept each other. Voice acting as noted was particularly strong in this series with the seiyuu’s of Misuzu and Chuuta deserving some praise for being able to make their characters stand out. <br />

    Becoming an Officer is never easy. There are people who would depend on you to protect the city. It is your job to make sure that happens. But what happens when you are to suddenly go up into space, take a test, and become an officer, as a middle schooler so to speak. It&#039;s not gonna be easy isn&#039;t it...?<br />
<br />
For all the hate it&#039;s getting, as much as this anime is not very good..I&#039;m actually well...Enjoying it.<br />
I will be reviewing this as an anime-only watcher.<br />
<br />
Story (7) <br />
<br />
elDLIVE is an anime that takes place on Earth, and on Space. It&#039;s about a middle school boy named

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239801">
        Chuuta who has a voice in his head that he can&#039;t seem to take out. Already there he&#039;s not living the life he had hoped for. Instead, it gets worse for him from here on. He gets taken and transported to a space police station which consists of mysterious creatures. On this space station, is where it&#039;ll give him the ultimate test, to see if he&#039;s well-suited enough for a job as a member of eLDLIVE. <br />
<br />
Well...Misuzu Sonokata doesn&#039;t seem to think so.<br />
<br />
Character (6)<br />
<br />
Misuzu, who is voiced by Hayami Saori (I swear she&#039;s in like every single anime this season). Is a very well...Interesting character. She wants things done professionally and doesn&#039;t take half-assed attempts lightly. It&#039;s especially hard for Chuuta since he fuks up most of the time, or doesn&#039;t take action at all. Which Misuzu sees as a strong point furthering suggesting her demand to not let him on the eLDLIVE team.<br />
<br />
However, Chuuta does pass the test, with the help with some SYMPATHY. Insert Drew, the creature that was the &quot;voice&quot; inside Chuuta this whole time. With Chuuta and Drew being of one heart and one mind. SYMPATHY. They can make some convenient weapons. Like...&quot;Sew them together&quot; and shit like that. Great power, can be useful..............But come up with better shit pls XD.<br />
<br />
Knowing this, Chuuta is gonna have to prove Misuzu the wrong. Cuz her personality is very cold towards him. She thinks he isn&#039;t worthy for such a task. Pls Chuuta...Pls Prove her wrong. Prove to her that you can become a badass eLDLIVE officer that can kick ass.<br />
<br />
As we we&#039;re hinted before, Chuuta had a past with his childhood friends. Who supposedly died or went missing due to a tragedy, that being a mudslide. With Chuuta being the only survivor, the past comes to haunt him to this day. Hopefully we get to see more of his past and I also hope that Chuuta gets further development in the future.<br />
<br />
Art (6)<br />
I know many might think that Studio Pierrot= Auto Bad. Which I can see why they might say that, and to some degree, I agree. But usually I don&#039;t care about the studio that does certain anime, as long as the staff doesn&#039;t fuck up something I loved when I read the source material. It&#039;s just the staff at Pierrot doesn&#039;t quite have a good reputation, for many series that pierrot has done has been handled..well..Incorrectly. But usually when It&#039;s a Pierrot anime, I&#039;ll give it a go, because you never know what might happen. So back to the art, I don&#039;t think the art is bad, but I don&#039;t think it is good either. Some parts just seemed choppy and some transitions seem a bit odd. However it is quite colourful, I&#039;ll give them that point. But the animation and art doesn&#039;t seem to be working for me right now. We&#039;ll just have to wait and see. Cuz right now I&#039;m not liking the art so far. It&#039;s not so bad that it makes me want to drop it, I just can&#039;t seem to enjoy the anime to the fullest because of this.<br />
<br />
Sound (7)<br />
<br />
That OP, is quite fine. Some of the sound effects are odd, but it&#039;s not enough for me to give it a 6. The BGM&#039;s are quite fitting and it sets the tone for the scenes of the anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (8)<br />
<br />
I can see why this anime has a below 6 score. But to be completely honest, disregarding these factors, I find eLDLIVE to be pretty enjoyable, despite all these things that make it bad. To the way the story is given, how some scenes are executed, to how the characters talk with each other and how funny it can be, I&#039;m actually having fun watching. Which is surprising to me. Chuuta&#039;s and Misuzu&#039;s chemistry just seems..Right in a sense. From what I&#039;m seeing in the OP, I can see Misuzu getting more comfortable with Chuuta&#039;s presence. Which means we might get more development from these two and their relationship. Heck if there&#039;s even a bit of romance I wouldn&#039;t mind, since I am a sucker for Romance.<br />
<br />
Overall (7)<br />
<br />
This anime isn&#039;t great, but it isn&#039;t the worst either, *cough Hand Shakers cough*<br />
This anime does stay true to its premise and how the characters are portrayed. It might not be super bad for me, but I won&#039;t desperately wait for each week&#039;s episode. I&#039;ll just watch this if I have the time. But this anime is an anime I fairly enjoy and will I can say that continue to watch this series, until it probably gets so bad. However I do hope it doesn&#039;t reach that point for me.<br />
<br />
For now, I&#039;ll give this a 7, It&#039;s ok. I wouldn&#039;t really recommend this to anyone. But if you have nothing to watch and is just bored with doing nothing, you can pick this up and watch it. <br />
<br />
Just sit back with a clear mindset, and don&#039;t set up high expectations. Because if you do, chances are you may be fairly disappointed.<br />
<br />
<br />

    elDLIVE ANIME REVIEW<br />
<br />
elDLIVE revolves around Chuta Kokonose, our main protagonist, on his adventures of being an elDLIVE Space Patrol.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I am saddened of its rating here in MAL. I am huge fan of Akira Amano since I finished watching/reading the Katekyo Hitman Reborn. And I was very hyped when this came out last January.<br />
<br />
Like Katekyo Hitman Reborn, this series started very slow. I think this whole first season is all about character development, since it&#039;s only a 12-episode anime. I honestly want more seasons though that may be unlikely since only a few appreciated the anime.<br />
<br />
The story started slow in the first few episodes but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243792">
        it delivered in the latter part.<br />
<br />
The art is mediocre and it&#039;s unusual to see that type of animation. Though the soundtrack is very good especially that ending theme.<br />
<br />
The characters look similar to Katekyo Hitman Reborn though some of the characters are aliens since it&#039;s an anime about space protection.<br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s a fair anime to me. If you&#039;ve endured the first 15-20 episodes of Katekyo Hitman Reborn, then you might as well give this a try. It&#039;s a slow starter but it will give you something to look forward for until the very end. And hoping for more seasons to make Chuta Kokonose more like Tsunayoshi Sawada.

    This is my first review ever so I&#039;m just going to go with what the numbers say.<br />
Also, I am a huge Katekyo Hitman Reborn fan so this will be little you know... <br />
<br />
Story = 8 - Very Good<br />
I watched a few shounen anime so this feels like the other shounen animes except that it has a Space Theme so that gives it something. Also, since this is just Season 1 and they didn&#039;t follow the manga on the last two episodes (They followed the manga from EP 1- 10), I&#039;d say the characters are well introduced. As for further/deeper character backgrounds, I&#039;m afraid I have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243665">
        to say this but read the manga if you wish. As for the story, they didn&#039;t reveal much but the whole &quot;We are space police, we protect the galaxy&quot; thing sooo... go read the manga if you wish, the plot thickens!<br />
Also even though they didn&#039;t follow through at the last two EPs, it&#039;s still well executed but it felt like the other shounen anime endings so there&#039;s that.<br />
<br />
Art = 8 - Very Good<br />
As long as the art is pleasing to me it automatically gets a &quot;Very Good&quot; response to me. Though they have different art styles in the manga and in the anime, it still strikes a &quot;Very Good&quot; to me<br />
<br />
Sound = 8 - Very Good<br />
I love both the OP and ED chosen for this anime, it&#039;s so fitting. As for the sound themes for every situation, fits fine for me. As for the voice acting, I&#039;m not one to judge who gets to voice who but to me they sounded like what I imagined them to sound like when I was reading the manga (except for Dolugh, I imagined him sounding like a werewolf for some reason).<br />
<br />
Character = 7 - Good<br />
Like I said, nothing much going on in the characters yet except for getting introduced. At least they showed Chuuta&#039;s little character improvement as the episodes pass. As for in the manga, character developments are great if you ask me. I like how they all improved there.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment = 9 - Great<br />
One of your favorite manga gets an anime adaptation? Very Good!<br />
They followed the manga? Great!<br />
Woops, they didn&#039;t follow through in the end... Stay at &quot;Great!&quot;<br />
Seriously I think IMO, they should have followed through! The ending-cut in the last EP if executed well, will show the viewers that the plot thickens and they will want Season 2! Oh well!<br />
Also just in case, they have reached ALMOST the current chapter in the manga except for the last few chapters which where the plot thickens and will be (hopefully) Season 2. So if there&#039;s gonna be Season 2, it will take a while.<br />
<br />
Overall = 8 - Very Good<br />
They should have followed through!!!<br />
Anyways, it&#039;s just Season 1. Like most animes, Season 1 is like the introduction of everything and the following seasons, if executed well, are the great ones!

    Eidlive is like one generic shonen anime. Is it bad or good? Honestly i enjoyed this anime. Yeah sometimes the dialog cringe but Overrall its ref refreshing. I really like how the character is goofy and weird its like watching nanatsu no taizai without the blood and gore. Good anime isn&#039;t about blood and gore and this anime nailed it. Give it a try and enjoy the anime you used to watch in your Childhood. <br />
<br />
Of course for every good show there is bound one drawback. Well it depend on the people but i think the organization Eidlive have a very little explanation. Its really
