    So, as someone who has seen ALL of the episodes and played the game, I&#039;d say this anime is okay and can get a bit weird for people who have not played the game itself. The anime for me was great in the beginning, but then as the episodes went by the story changed and became extremely rushed. This could have been a great anime with a season 2 included due to the contents of the plot from the game, however it was obvious that paper games just wanted a &quot;promotional anime&quot;. The last episode definitely gives off a &quot;if you want to know more,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358493">
        play the game&quot; type of vibe. I don&#039;t think they&#039;re looking into making a season 2 even though you could call the last episode a cliffhanger. Also, don&#039;t be fooled by the genre. This is based on an otome game, but it quickly changes vibes. This isn&#039;t your typical cutesy girly otome genre. <br />
 <br />
Things I didn&#039;t like from the anime:<br />
- cringey scenes &amp; bad animation sometimes (running scenes especially)<br />
- mediocre OST throughout the whole anime (there were exceptions where the OST was great at some points but the game has epic OST)<br />
- they didn&#039;t use the art OR soundtrack seen and heard in the trailers, what happened here MAPPA?? <br />
- plot diverged from the game around episode 10<br />
- EXTREMELY rushed<br />
- only 12 episodes (although this seems to be an anime trend lately)<br />
- some things can&#039;t be understood unless you&#039;ve played the game before <br />
- ending song takes away some of the seriousness from how the episode ends<br />
- characters were much more emotional in the game whereas in the anime MC takes a while longer to show emotion<br />
<br />
Things I loved from the anime:<br />
- Seeing the characters from the game get animated<br />
- there are some cute, funny moments<br />
- they animated some cute scenes from the game <br />
- if you played the game, the anime gives possible future spoilers and clears up some stuff that happens in the game<br />
- it stayed true to the character design of the game and their personalities as well<br />
- They used the same VA&#039;s from the Japanese audio from the game, which is pretty cool<br />
- So many little details added from the game seen in the episodes including matching the outfits they wore for that specific episode<br />
<br />
Overall, I would recommend watching this anime if you have played the game, but I can definitely see how it would confuse non-players since they fail to explain some stuff. I did enjoy watching the anime and each episode picks up off of the next, so no fillers whatsoever. Straight to the point. If you enjoy the superpower genre and mystery, I&#039;d give it a shot. <br />

    This show is a bit weird, but that is what keeps me watching. It&#039;s certainly different from what I&#039;ve seen before, and it&#039;s been a pleasant experience so far. Should you watch it? You should give it a shot! <br />
<br />
The first thing of note is the well done art style. It&#039;s mostly fitting for whatever moment of the show it is at. As it can be super bright and well done in parts, but well done in the dark too. Cannot fault there, it&#039;s a great and colourful artstyle. The sound of course is well done too, major props to the anime for that.<br />
<br />
The characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review351366">
        are a bit of a mixed back, while there isn&#039;t anything wrong of them, besides the MC, then there isn&#039;t anyone else that matters besides the Evols themselves. Rest of the cast just feels generic. Which is a bit of a shame, but they&#039;re not all bad, and do add a little to the story. Which speaking of which is an interesting concept, and why I wanted to watch this show in the first place. It&#039;ll be interesting to see how she carries the company onward, and you should see how she does it too! Give it a shot if you&#039;re curious about it.

    Some Spoiler! But not alot.<br />
<br />
So let&#039;s get right to it: this anime is hot, pandering garbage.<br />
<br />
What I saw in the first episode was promise. A FL (female lead) that did stand up for herself and have what a lot of FL&#039;s lack: ambition. <br />
<br />
However, what remains an issue is the FL&#039;s (f*ck I don&#039;t even remember her name) lack of conviction or power (or brain?). She has the will, but she has no way. To no fault of her own, the writer&#039;s keep throwing her into situations where she&#039;s not allowed to show off any strength other than:<br />
<br />
Her: &quot;Please you&#039;re a good person I know

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354856">
        it! Look! I&#039;m the main character!&quot;<br />
<br />
Villain: &quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
While a good heart is arguably a good strength in itself, her powerlessness and damsel-like nature where she has to be saved by every piece of man-candy at least once each episode just goes against the ENTIRE THEMATIC CONCEPT OF THIS DAMN SHOW. <br />
<br />
If you&#039;ve watched the show you probbaly already know, the &#039;Evolver&#039; concept was developed on top of the Red Queen Hypothesis coined by Leigh Van Valen. It&#039;s an evolutionary theorum summarizing the &#039;arms race&#039; (or the Red Queen Race) of evolving. In the same way a plant evolves to ward off creatures that eat it, because of the nature of evolution there will always be a back and forth between when the plant evolves to protect itself, or when the creature evolves to break down it&#039;s barriers. Hence, the evolvers are born with powers to protect themselves yet organisations like the &#039;Black Swan&#039; will form to tip the scales again.<br />
<br />
Spoiler: THIS WOMAN HAS F***ING FUTURE SEEING ABILITIES, BUT IS STILL STUPID. Episode 8, which is where I&#039;m up to, this girl really sees doom coming from Room 404, BUT WALKS INSIDE ANYWAY LMAO? Of course, this will only be a temporary set back till the roulette wheel spins to determine which one of the four plain, generic pieces of bread they call male leads comes to save her ass. This show (and it&#039;s fans) seem to pride itself in having a FL with &#039;powers&#039;, but they&#039;ve really just pulled a &#039;Stand My Heroes&#039; and given the FL a power with no other thematic use for it other than: &quot;I wanna save my friends!&quot; (Disclaimer: her friends almost always end up saving her). She shows no interest in controlling her power or finding out about her past (which, in Episode 7, she knows she is able to through Victor), which is just weird? <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t chalk this up to anything but the writer&#039;s wanting to sound smart and interesting, yet can&#039;t actually put the pedal to the metal. They want to have a &#039;strong&#039; female lead, yet constantly force her to be saved by men. I laugh at that scene where she jumps in front of Victor to save him from the booklet. The writer&#039;s had this huge chance to show off her power and make her the hero, but they really just could not do it. Victor HAD to protect and save her (and then really creepily keep her locked up in a hospital for weeks while grooming her into believing it was for her safety? Uh, okay.)<br />
<br />
Speaking of male leads, not much to say other than &quot;F**k they really just grabbed a wheel with all the major professions, molded the character&#039;s around that, made some of them her childhood friend&#039;s and called it a day&quot;. Let&#039;s say it again: PROFESSIONS ARE NOT PERSONALITY TRAITS. MAKING THEM CHILDHOOD FRIENDS DOES NOT EQUATE WRITING A PROPER RELATIONSHIP.<br />
<br />
So if you&#039;ve made it this far, thanks. I&#039;ll attempt to watch the entire show but honestly I don&#039;t even know if I can. It&#039;s bland sh*t like this that gets Reverse Harem permabanned from studios. <br />
<br />
My 2 star rating is because the opening song is a banger.

    Koi to Producer: EVOL X LOVE: Another Visual-novel Otome game turned into an anime adaptation.<br />
<br />
Story/plot: 8/10<br />
The story begins from where the protagonist, &quot;I&quot;, is the owner of a TV Producer company, &quot;Miracle Finder&quot;.  A pretty unique storyline, where it centers around Evol and Evolvers. <br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
Resembles closely to the game art style, clean artwork , gorgeous background and lighting. The ambience lighting are pretty bright or dark in some parts of the show. Lots of fancy effects included. <br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
I lowkey was hoping that they would use the in-game music, but the anime music was quite matching and good too. Though it didn&#039;t give

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358490">
        the intense atmosphere that it gives in the game. I love the opening and ending music.<br />
Voice acting gave me feels on some parts of the show.<br />
The gunshot sound effects is pretty realistic. <br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
The main male characters, Victor, Lucien, Gavin and Kiro. <br />
Victor, Gavin and Kiro character designs are typical and commonly found in many otome games. Lucien&#039;s design is quite unique and memorable. <br />
The supporting side-characters are lovable, such as Goldman and Minor. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
This show skips a lot of fillers and side stories. It only focus on the main plot, probably to fit into 12 episodes; and to prevent from being biased.  The main male characters have a fair share of screen time. I love how they use some of the in-game dialogues in the show. The main dialogues for the main characters:<br />
Gavin: &quot;As long as you&#039;re in the wind, I can feel you.&quot;<br />
Kiro: &quot;If I was still a little kid, I wouldn&#039;t hand you the bag of chips.&quot; <br />
Victor: &quot;Be careful. There&#039;s no guarantee someone will always save you.&quot;<br />
Lucien: &quot;When you&#039;re in danger, trust your instincts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both the Chinese &amp; Japanese versions are enjoyable to watch.  <br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10 <br />
Recommend for those who love seeing handsome fictional characters, or those who wants to feel loved<br />
<br />

    This review contains some spoilers.<br />
<br />
[Plot]:<br />
<br />
“In this world, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.”<br />
- The Red Queen Hypothesis<br />
<br />
In this cruel world of natural selection, species must evolve faster than others to gain a favourable position in the biological chain. Those who believe in the Red Queen Hypothesis insist that humans should actively seek changes in order to rule nature.  “Evol” is a special ability that only appears in a very small number of people. These few people who own Evol are called “Evolvers” and they are super-evolved humans who possess superpowers that enable them to surpass ordinary

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354931">
        humans. Black Swan (B.S) is a criminal organization that conducts illegal biological experiments in order to study Evol genes to find a way to modify human genes. They are obsessed with the evolution of humanity such as converting ordinary people into Evolvers as they see it as an opportunity to change the world. They are concerned in securing the Queen, a special type of an Evolver whose genes can awaken and enhance the abilities of others. <br />
<br />
[Characters]:<br />
<br />
The heroine comes across a bit naïve as she is very altruistic. Her biggest flaw is that she has too much empathy, often to point where she cares more about the safety of others than herself. However, she’s a strong independent woman with her own backstory, motivations, and values. Many people call her “stupid” but they often forget that she is an inexperienced college graduate who lost her only family not so long ago. Despite this, she struggles anyways to gather information relating to her predicament: the mysteries around her father’s death, the childhood memories she cannot recall, the dark conspiracies behind B.S. She refuses to accept being protected in ignorance and would rather make the choice to always face the truth, no matter how painful it is. <br />
<br />
What I like about the four male leads is that while they carry the specific tropes we’re used to in anime, they’re just not simply that. The boys have their own stories, special bonds with the heroine, past that is filled with layers upon layers, etc.<br />
<br />
***Note: The character descriptions for Victor, Lucien, Gavin and Kiro are translations from the Chinese official character profiles for the game. I cherry-picked the information that best describes their characters while not spoiling too much.***<br />
<br />
Victor is the president of the Loveland Financial Group (LFG). He is a &quot;capitalist&quot; who is strict and serious towards people and things. He is not a kind philanthropist and he won&#039;t waste time or money on meaningless things; his company&#039;s interests will always be the focus of his considerations. He has a cold and indifferent outward appearance, but underneath is a soft heart. However, he knows the principle of survival of the fittest better than anyone, and so he doesn&#039;t choose to help at all times. From the start, he has never been a saviour and just tries his best to help the &quot;weak&quot; become &quot;strong&quot;. <br />
<br />
Lucien is a well-educated, talented, and quiet young professor. Outwardly, he is the leading scientist in the field of neurology and extremely persistent with scientific studies, but in fact he hides unknown secrets. Although he is gentle towards people, it makes people feel that there is a sense of distance, and it is difficult to really enter his inner world. The progress of science is often accompanied by many failed experiments, and towards those failed experiments Lucien will feel regret. But at the same time, he believes that it is a kind of honour to contribute to a better future for humankind.<br />
<br />
Gavin is an Evol agent, who recently took the initiative to be transferred to the Loveland police bureau. Acting as a special officer, he conceals his true purposes and actions. Although his personality is rebellious, stubborn, and intractable, he has his own principles of doing things and carries a strong sense of justice. He has many informant friends that belong in the grey zone, and he often breaks what&#039;s known as the rules of convention. He uses methods that don&#039;t look so &quot;just&quot; to achieve his goals. Because of this, there&#039;s many people who misunderstand him and feel that his actions are inappropriate. <br />
<br />
Kiro is an idol who shines like the sun, has extraordinary charm, and is very sincere. Although outwardly he looks like a big kid, the maturity in his heart is not small. An idol&#039;s work is very busy, but he never once complains; he just tries to show his best side to the audience. In addition to his occupation as a star and performer, he also has multiple identities and a secret goal. Kiro clearly understands the ways of the world and the dark side of reality, but he always walks on the path towards the light. <br />
<br />
[Enjoyment]:<br />
A main criticism for this show is that it’s very fast paced and the episodes condense the lore and simplifies the events from the original game. In some episodes, the action scenes goes by in a blur and the audience doesn’t feel the tension or the emotional connection from the different revelations. Due to the constraints of the anime being only 12 episodes, a lot of the intenseness of the main story was toned down. Another criticism I have is the lack of flow and connection between these events. As a big fan of the game, I didn’t notice it as much but I feel anime-only viewers would feel a bit disjointed. But nonetheless, there are lots of twists in this anime and after a few episodes, the story goes towards a direction you wouldn’t expect, making it highly enjoyable. <br />
<br />
Despite the criticisms, the anime sticks to the main story by not adding any nonsense fillers or fluff as you would see in traditional anime shows. I still enjoyed how the anime executed the storyline because overall, the core events of the story are well depicted. Many anime-original scenes had be added to help piece the story together and make it more clear to the newcomers. The anime director wanted this show to appeal to both fans of the game and new viewers and the show is heavily focused on the plot rather than the romance. There’s always some extra scenes after the credits so make sure you don’t miss that! Overall, this is one of the best reverse harem shows and I will also say this is the best adaptation of an otome/joseimuke game. <br />

    You look over at The God of Highschool and come have a peek at this and look again, hang on a minute, they are both by MAPPA this season???<br />
<br />
It would be wrong to say that I didn’t contribute to the production of this anime as I have made a full on 188rmb in app purchase on the game. While I’m no whale player, I am a LV.70 player, as of writing this review, the diary function of the game tells me I’ve met our four boys for 1000 days, and Ling Xiao (Shaw/Siho/Sho) for 575 days, the Chinese server of the game existed for 1016

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358873">
        days to put that into perspective. <br />
<br />
All the players of this game will passionately inform you that Mr Love: Queen’s Choice (Who even came up with the cringy English name, the localisation of the English names is also a bit crap in my opinion but I’m not going to dwell on that for now) is not like your average otome gacha game, joseimuke to be exact. It really is one of a kind, 50 hours down the game your ‘love interest’ will be pointing a gun to your head threaten to kill you.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story from the game is just a mediocre superpowers plotline, and frankly that didn’t change for the anime either. “I” have EVOL (superpowers) and “I” try to uncover the evil organisation who is trying to destroy the world, that’s it in a nutshell. Safe to say the story doesn&#039;t make a lot of sense as you continue to watch on.<br />
<br />
I don’t know how other players see it, but the plotline of the game isn’t even the fun bit, the story is a bit messy and have plot holes here and there. Season 1 of the game didn’t even have a conclusive ending and season 2 was just the MC rebirthed into a new world, literally an AU. The whole story of this game is dragged out to make sure it never ends and make players pay more money.<br />
<br />
The MC not having a name is a self-immersion device put into the game, Chinese players of this game gets really really really angry if there was ever a hint of a name given to our MC. But man, getting called Poteto-Chippusu-hime takes you out of the immersion if anything, flipping hell, stop being a ween, just give her a damn name.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Let’s be real, you are lying to yourself if you watched The God of Highschool this season and come here to say this is even remotely equal in art quality. If you showed me EVOL and then told me MAPPA was doing season 3 of SNK I would be anticipating in a One Punch Man season 2 travesty.<br />
<br />
This is a quick money throwaway anime, the whole point of this is to make more merch get more people to play the game, as if anyone on the production cared to draw anything properly, but the developers of the game know even if it’s shit people will still buy into it, they look down on you for playing otome games and then feed the otome game to you, kaching! Kaching! We know this because the fangirls are screaming at this saying how good it is and how MAPPA did a great job. Paper Games be clowning you.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The music and ost is mediocre I don’t have anything to say about it. I wanted to talk a little about the CVs of the anime. There’s a Japanese and Chinese dub to it, pretty faithful to the game with the same voice actors in both versions. The Japanese dub is pretty good, the Chinese dub on the other hand is not as polished as the Japanese one I have to say. The issue I have with the Chinese dub is that the mouth flaps don’t match, they didn’t even bother to match it, funny enough, the text in the anime has been changed to Chinese, like the text on the whiteboards and notebooks, but not the mouth flaps!<br />
<br />
As for “my” voice, “Watashi” is much better in the Japanese version, voiced by Kanemoto Hisako. In the Chinese version I don’t even know who it is, there’s very little information on “Zhang Qi” on the internet, I have a feeling they kept it low because again, allowing players to self-insert.<br />

The four boys in the Chinese version is alright. If you are familiar with the voice of these four voice actors, you’ve pretty much watched every Chinese anime (and drama and any media that requires a voice). The voice acting industry in China is not as mature as the one in Japan, the same old voice actors will literally do every other show there is. They are very versatile, so versatile you probably didn’t even notice Kira and Lan Wangji is the same voice actor. Haku is also Wei Wuxian fyi.<br />
 <br />
Overall:<br />
Happy Mid-Autumn, what terrible anime.<br />

    It may contain minor spoilers!<br />
<br />
First of all, this anime comes from a mobile game called Mr. Love: Queen’s Choice. If you enjoy Mystic Messenger, then you should give a try to both the game and the anime.<br />
<br />
The story is simple, it’s about a woman who wants to develop a career as a media producer. But, her life changes one day as she starts to encounter Evolvers (humans with special abilities, superpowers). And (spoiler, but you shouldn’t be surprised by now) she happens to be an Evolver too! The story has villains, romance, superpowers, drama. It&#039;s also sort of dark as the Heroine finds herself in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review352572">
        dangerous situations quite often. Why, you ask? That&#039;s the whole point of this anime and that&#039;s why you should watch it.<br />
<br />
As you could expect from a shoujo/romance anime, the art is beautiful. Brilliant colors, pretty scenery, shiny big eyes. It’s all prettily drawn and stunning.<br />
<br />
Both the opening and ending are good. Nothing out of this world, but enjoyable regardless. The music suits the situations, the characters and their feelings, so it’s (a least from me) a good point.<br />
<br />
The characters are okay. Their designs are not too original, but they go with their personalities accordingly. The Heroine (Watashi, Miss Chips, Idiot or however you may call her) has an okay personality — not annoying but not too outstanding. The male leads are probably the reason why most people watch this anime — they are acceptable. As you could expect they all want to “save” the Heroine and want to bond with her. All of their personalities are well portrayed in the anime. Side characters like Minor, Anna, Kiki and so on are also okay in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Overall, as someone who has been playing the game for a while (and is completely in love with Victor/Zen), this anime does not meet my expectations. The pace of the story is weird, too many things happen in one episode and then characters move on easily from it. It doesn’t even give you time to process some information or to connect with the characters and understand their relationship. It all seems too shallow. But that doesn’t mean it’s bad, the story itself is interesting and a tad intriguing —my main problem is the way it is told. <br />
<br />
Will you enjoy this? If you happen to like things such as romance, inverse harems, fantasy and superpowers then probably. The anime isn’t slow paced and a lot of things happen in one episode. Must likely, every episode will leave you more confused than the other. But it’s alright, if you’re not too picky — that is.<br />
<br />
Let’s see how the anime turns out in the end.<br />

    The anime of the videogame for smartphones is ok. You can clearly see the parts of the story from the game, but it lacks some parts of the original story from the game. Some parts are shorter then the original and others donˋt exist.<br />
So in the story part of the anime ist failed a little bit. <br />
<br />
The charakters are a bit different from the original in the videogame but they are ok.<br />
<br />
Personally I like the game ( with the same name as the anime) more, there is the story longer and you will enjoy every singel moment.<br />
<br />
The anime is totally ok and you shold watch

    As someone who&#039;s know nothing about the game version, I enjoying this anime so much!<br />
Otome or reverse harem genre usually always have those repetitive formula that always makes me bored easily. But KoiPro nothing like that, they going more smoothly. I hate it when the guy always touch the girl so freely and suddenly (and sometimes even  the girl get pissed by it) in otome genre, but this show aren&#039;t like that. The guys treat the girl with respect, and I love how soft them all towards the girl...<br />
<br />
Story 8/10 : The story going pretty quick, but in right portion. Definitely not an anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review359827">
        about handsome guys doing cute things and enjoying everyday life etc, it&#039;s conflict also very heavy and they build it smoothly, even though I felt like last 1 or 2 episode a bit rushed<br />
<br />
Art &amp; animation 9/10 : Really satisfied with the art! everyone always looks so pretty. But the animation not something that &quot;amazing&quot; it is have some good sakuga but overall it&#039;s decent for the series imo, stil good tho<br />
<br />
Sound 7/10 : nothing memorable for the backsound, but I really love the OP and ED<br />
<br />
Character 7/10 : my only complaint for characters is, they not explore them deep enough, well... understandable since this anime only have 12 episode,, the character introduced as &quot;enough&quot; for the sake of the story&#039;s conflict, but honestly I really can&#039;t feel their personality<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9/10 : REALLY enjoy this anime! Come with low expectation as &quot;yep, another reverse harem/otome anime&quot; but it surprisingly pass it. It has alot good moments! I even cry in some episode and the MC is not trash, she is amazing actually

    Firstly - PLAY THE GAME<br />
The game makes sense/ the game isn&#039;t a rush job/ the game actually has an in depth well developed plot thats taken years and years of love. Its also more interactive....doesn&#039;t cut out important details and actually makes sense. <br />
<br />
Firstly I am a huge Game player who realllllly wanted to see the thing I love in anime form.... I was so excited I  reviewed it weekly on Youtube. <br />
<br />
But within a few episodes of horrific cuts/ tweaks... and very disjointed plot line ... I realized this was just a train wreck of everything I love being thrown at 12 episodes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358451">
        and hoping for the best. <br />
Mappa destroyed God Of Highschool....and its destroyed this by almost the same dam mistake....STOP CUTTING THE IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND STOP RUSHING ANIME. <br />
The anime spans 18 of the 23 available chapters currently available more being worked on etc. Each chapter in game is 10 chunks ....so thats 180 chunks of well thought through plot.....thrown together in 12 episodes....<br />
the result....<br />
A disjointed rush job that anime only viewers probably sat dam confused scratching their heads to wtf is going on...The anime tries to explain some stuff.... but instead of the slow well planned build the game had... and the getting to know the characters properly .... you get spoiled every episode....<br />
They took show dont tell too far. <br />
<br />
Nothing comes as a shock because... well Mappa showed you in the previous anime that guys gunna go bad.... or that guys evil.... <br />
<br />
My advice... Just play the game and then if you feel brave maybe watch the anime....but keep a strong drink to hand as they massacre everything that made the original interesting.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    I honestly regret watching this. I don&#039;t regret much, but this was kind of a waste of time. I know that this was based off of a game. It&#039;s kind of like how anime that are made off of a manga are not (as) good. I haven&#039;t played the game, but I can already assume that it was better than this. Reverse harems usually have the following: an annoying, ignorant girl who can&#039;t do anything for herself, despite having some sort of &quot;power&quot; or &quot;specialty&quot; that puts her above the rest. This anime is no exception when it comes to that. I was hoping that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358412">
        she would stop tripping all the time and actually do something besides saying that she will help and not even doing so. I also didn&#039;t like the stereotypical males in here either, and when you think about it, they kind of all have similar personalities. If you are looking for an interesting reverse harem with a strong female lead, this is not for you, as it was not for me.

    Joseimuke and otome game to anime adaptations are always average whether you like it or not. The original source material is where the story, characters, and plot shine the best even if there are underlying issues with how each of those three are presented. That isn&#039;t to say I don&#039;t like the idea of these types of games getting an anime adaptation because I am ikemen trash and love seeing my men being animated. But I&#039;m starting to realize just how redundant some of these types of shows are. Not that I think they&#039;re terrible (except for Stand My Heroes Piece of Truth), it&#039;s just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358394">
        that in the long run, do they really need an anime adaptation? This applies to Koi to Producer.<br />
<br />
I have played the game long before the anime was announced and I&#039;ll admit, I wasn&#039;t very excited that it was getting an adaptation. Because there will be a lot cut out from the game. The end result was a show that cut out so many bits and pieces and tried but failed to be a decent adaptation. For those who haven&#039;t played MLQC, there is a lot, and I mean a lot of information that is cut out for the sake of 12 episodes, not to mention the game has more plot and character development along with a complicated storyline. A storyline which the anime butchered. I wanted to give Koi to Producer the benefit of the doubt but I couldn&#039;t ignore the glaring issues that were presented to me.<br />
<br />
This review is focusing on the anime only, not the game. Keep that in mind.<br />
<br />
The anime tries to do its best to be a decent show about superpowers and love which can work if done decently enough. The problem is how much of the game was cut out from the anime that made everything so rushed and certain plot points inconsequential since the anime skips ahead to a new episode, shoving about 3 or 4 chapters in one episode that it comes off as rushed. Had this gone beyond 12 episodes and maybe 15 or 16, then the pacing would be good and no important story details would be skipped. I can recall so many things from the game up to chapter 18 that were not present in the anime which dulls not only the entertainment of it, but also the plot as well.<br />
<br />
The MC... I have mixed feelings about her both in the game and anime. The anime MC (yes I&#039;m aware they gave her a name but I&#039;m calling her MC) is your basic run of the mill MC among many other brown-haired MCs under the sun. I hate to call her basic, but she&#039;s basic. I&#039;m getting annoyed by this trope of making MCs in a reverse harem to be basic, weak, and stupid. This MC in the anime was wasted potential because she not only fails to be a decent character, she lacks any autonomy other than being a major plot convenience for the guys in her life. She&#039;s only there for them, never giving her the chance to stand out. Now, the MC in the game is a little bit better than the anime, but both can be very boring and downright idiotic at times. &quot;Oh no, there&#039;s something happening but even though I have the power to stop it, I can&#039;t so I&#039;ll just stand there while my knight in shining armor comes in because of deus ex machina.&quot; Tell me that isn&#039;t 70% of MCs. So much wasted potential for her.<br />
<br />
As for the boys, I do like their characters in the game much more than the anime. It&#039;s the same with the MC except they have more backstory and development (arguably more in the game) and do have the purpose of being in the story other than eye-candy. Which, they are handsome, let&#039;s give credit where credit is due and their seiyuus are pretty great. This goes back to my earlier gripe with how much was cut because there could&#039;ve been more time to have them be developed in than they were in the span of 12 episodes.<br />
<br />
Overall, I think this adaptation shouldn&#039;t have even happened. As much as I want to see my beautiful ikemen get adapted into an anime, they&#039;re better off. What we got from Koi to Producer was a rushed anime that offered little to nothing. Overall, a redundant anime adaptation.

    Alright i have heard about the game which is popular among the girls and so i thought should try this adaption and i am gonna be honest with you it is just an fan-service nothing major, despite the plot-holes i believe this anime is for girls only even though in my perspective because i do watch reverse harem but this one is purely not something to get excited about it&#039;s way too generic and those characters which are main looks way too supporting i really don&#039;t find them very attractive i guess those fan arts triggered those girls LOL, that&#039;s why it&#039;s kinda popular game

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354439">
        , about the story it&#039;s just not ok at all, i&#039;d say so so like i said it&#039;s not something to be curious about, generic in the end, even animation is too bad knowing mappa is behind the animation and everything, seems very low budget, i really don&#039;t think animes should be made like this based upon fan-service it&#039;s good to make something for fans but put some logic and this anime has nothing just a fan service, look at the god of high school despite the plot holes it&#039;s still interesting and characters seems alive and fresh they look much better in a sense of main characters!<br />
<br />
overall i&#039;d give it 4 out of 10<br />
Not Recommended

    In the beginning the anime was really promising, great story but in my opinion they make it a little bit boring. I expected more action, the thread seems to focus too much on love etc. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack is really bad, opening and ending songs are too melancholic.<br />
<br />
I like the art style, characters looks really nice. Also it&#039;s great that they decided to follow the art style from the game!<br />
<br />
In the beginning I was really excited to see next episodes but after 5/6 of them it started to get a little boring.  Maybe I had too high expectacions?<br />
<br />
It had a great potencial but they don&#039;t

    I haven&#039;t played the game, so maybe I don&#039;t understand the full potential of this anime. I dropped it halfway through because I was so bored. Which is weird because the plot itself about super powers and conspiracies with a dash of handsome men is normally right up my alley. I can only think that my boredom stems from the weird pacing and the Mary Sue main character. Everyone loves her for very basic reasons and she is painfully boring despite having a strong motivational backstory.<br />
<br />
Overall, I decided I got no enjoyment from it and would rather watch other shows.

    It&#039;s a Must watch, especially for those who are looking for a Complicated plot with beautiful Protagonists. First half literally made me love this series, but 2nd half was so unclear that it ruined the interest.. So many questions were left unanswered in the last episode, with no proper ending. <br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
First of all, the most impressive thing about this anime is its Art. A huge round of Applause! <br />
<br />
I simply Loved the appearances of the characters, shiny eyes, beautiful sceneries and colors of this series. Dresses of the female protagonist are so brilliant. I&#039;m glad she isn&#039;t going to wear the same outfit for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358436">
        the whole series (unlike almost every anime) Her light makeup, her dress styles, dress colors, her sandals, what should I not notice? It&#039;s all worth the praise.. (I couldn&#039;t stop myself from taking screenshots 😅) <br />
I can&#039;t say if everyone wants to see only beautiful protagonists like me or not, but I don&#039;t watch anime where characters aren&#039;t handsome 😬 <br />
Every character is such a masterpiece in this anime, so it was like a treat to me! After &quot;Hakuoki Shinsengumi Kitan&quot;, this is the 2nd anime which caught my attention for handsome sexy men.<br />
<br />
Story: 6/10<br />
I&#039;ve always been a fond of complicated plot, that keeps us engaged to watch more and more episodes. I hate simplest plots where you already know what&#039;s gonna happen next and predict the ending in the first few episodes..<br />
<br />
This story is quite unpredictable &amp; quite fast, because every episode has TONS OF SHOCKING incidents happening one after the other. This seemed reasonable only till 9 episodes. Questions after questions were left in the minds of audiences without answering, bothered to the extent that the story became junk in the end.. <br />
 <br />
A girl, who has no memories of her first five years of life, because of a specific incident, is a Producer of a company now, a company inherited from her father. Even when there aren&#039;t any possibilities to save the company from going bankrupt, she does her best, so it depicts SHE NEVER GIVES UP. This quality of hers attracts audience&#039;s attention.. In doing so, she meets 4 men who have special powers (&amp; are called Evolvers), who are acquainted with her already in the past which she has forgotten or maybe someone erased her memories. <br />
Evolvers is quite a unique theme (for me at least)! She tries to find out the memory how she was lost and the truth of her father’s death…<br />
This show went to shit starting from episode 9. The story wasn&#039;t clear. Who is the black queen? Boys only fighting and fighting, without telling who are they fighting for? Haku promising to return but not telling anyone the real thing? No proper ending of romance with any guy? What happened to Kira (Kiro)? Who did he join in the end? Why Shimo (Lucien) was with the Black Swan to begin with? Why now he acts like everything is normal? Why does she act like nothing ever happened with him? And why do you say it&#039;s only the start when it&#039;s obvious there won&#039;t be second season? Ughh! It pissed me off in the end.. <br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 10/10<br />
All the characters are worth discussing, without a doubt. <br />
Female protagonist is quite a beauty, with a great sense of dressing. Her politeness and manners are shown through her words and speech. Her &quot;not giving up&quot; quality is what I like the most. She has the power to cheer everyone up, around her, with her innocent smile and purity.<br />
<br />
One of the four Evolvers, is Haku. He works at the police station and went to the same high school as the heroine. He appears to be a stoic and unapproachable individual at the beginning and has his own moral code. Quite a personality he has! Since he&#039;s a police, he&#039;s good at action and martial arts. Brown hair, golden eyes, pierced ears and Police jacket make him far more attractive than any other person.<br />
<br />
Next is the founder and CEO of Loveland Financial Group, ZEN. His company LFG is the one which invests in the heroine’s producing company. At first glance, he can be perceived as cold, reserved and difficult to please, but he also has a gentle side. Suited booted, stern eyes, black hair, a Perfect CEO appearance, around whom everyone is afraid to speak casually. Again! Quite a personality he has! (If I&#039;m saying their personalities hit hard, please trust me😅) <br />
<br />
3rd one is Kiro, a popular superstar and idol known for his charming looks. His irresistible smile can&#039;t be overlooked. He has a very fun-loving, playful, and kind personality, unlike other evolvers. He meets the heroine in a convenience store and becomes the cast of her shows. Blonde, blue eyes, very casual appearance yet so attractive. <br />
<br />
4th one is Shimon, a famous neuroscientist who has owned a high IQ since childhood. He is extremely gentle and friendly to the heroine, but it seems that this “light-hearted” personality was just a decoy to mask his darker self.. He&#039;s very doubtful, like an unknown man with smile on his face always. <br />
 So for characters, I think 10/10 is quite justifiable. <br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
I really am loving its OPENING OST. Its music is amazing. But background music isn&#039;t fitting to the situations many times. <br />
 <br />
Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
It will be a lie if I say, I didn&#039;t enjoy. I enjoyed every single minute till episode 9. Afterwards, the story became unclear and we kept waiting for clarity and answers, making it not enjoyable enough to be rated as 10/10. I&#039;d rate it 7/10<br />
<br />
Story&#039;s unpredictability and characters are enough to make us fall for this series. Go for it! 👍🏼

    Very good anime, mediocre adaptation. This could&#039;ve been one of the best animes of the year and Mappa just wasted the chance.<br />
<br />
Based on a mobile game with an amazingly thrilling story and an epic soundtrack by V.K., this anime adaptation looked quite promising in the trailers. However, many of its aspects ended up being disappointing to the players, especially because it mainly shows only one side of the story, the cute shoujo one, cutting or rushing almost all the emotional, heart breaking and action scenes.<br />
Interestingly, somehow, although it&#039;s an awful adaptation, the anime is still enjoyable. It&#039;s one of the best productions of the season,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356856">
        with a good story that is not the typical reverse harem. Even though the game&#039;s main target is young women, the anime can be enjoyed by everyone, as it doesn&#039;t focus on the romantic side of the game but on its main story, which is a sci-fi tragic thriller. It has almost no fanservice scenes and the style is quite innovating. The colour scheme of peaceful scenes is amazingly beautiful.<br />
In summary, despite all its flaws, it&#039;s worth watching.<br />
<br />
<br />
NOTE: We&#039;re still missing two episodes and it worries me that they&#039;re planning to fit four complete game chapters into only one episode. Those episodes contain the most dramatic and revealing scenes of the whole game.<br />
EDIT: The season has finally come to an end. The final episode changed a huge amount of things, removing the best parts of the game, which is still ongoing. It&#039;s not bad, but doing this turned it into an average shoujo anime, instead of making it a ground-breaking series. It is worth watching for purely entertainment reasons, but it&#039;s nowhere near as good as the game. It only shows one side of the story, which is way more complex than it seems. It works fine on its own but he experience is incomplete without the game. <br />
<br />
<br />
Next, I will explain why I think it is quite a bad adaptation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story<br />
In my opinion, its admirable how the studio has managed to adapt such a long story that actually deserved 24 episodes into just twelve episodes. However, changing the order of events while trying to summarise everything seriously affected character development. The events are so rushed that relationship building is impossible to understand by anime-only watchers. Things that should&#039;ve been known at the very end were revealed from the first episodes. This hasn&#039;t changed the final result, but removing the mysteries made the anime less thrilling.<br />
The way events were developed makes it feel as if the director wanted to focus on a completely different market. Instead of being aimed towards adult women, it&#039;s as if they were trying to grab the younger public&#039;s attention. There is no way this was a good idea, because, as I said before, they removed what made the game unique in its genre. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Studio Mappa released a couple of trailers with stunning visuals, using the soundtrack of the game. The drawing style was quite close to that from the game. Beautiful.<br />
Because the first episodes are for character and universe introduction, they&#039;re mostly calm. Their animation is suitable and the studio indeed tried to stick of the art style of the game, which is quite pretty. The scenery is stunning, as usual from Mappa.<br />
However, starting from ep. 7, it should&#039;ve been full of action and dramatic scenes, but it didn&#039;t happen. Not only had they rushed them, but also their animation quality was awful and the drawings were horrendous as compared to what they had promised. The characters are lacking facial expressions and their movements aren&#039;t smooth. Attacks from chasing scenes went from things like bullet rains and collapsing buildings to a couple of badly drawn weak fireballs or random stuff thrown by characters with an &quot;I&#039;ve got no idea of what I&#039;m doing&quot; face.<br />
As for the voice acting, only one secondary character voice actor did a great job in a dramatic scene, the rest is not outstanding. <br />
The soundtrack was not the same as in the game. This is understandable because dealing with labels is not an easy task. Nevertheless, it could&#039;ve been better. With the exception of a couple of tracks and a super cool insert song, the soundtrack is totally mainstream. <br />
With the combination of a bad animation and a flat soundtrack and voice acting, the feelings that should&#039;ve been conveyed in such scenes were completely gone. <br />

    Otome game adaptations tend to get a bad rap and I&#039;m sure tons of people wrote this one off as another Brothers Conflict, Amnesia or shoot, even Diabolik Lovers (which is actually a guilty pleasure of mine). And the MC of this show not having a name certainly gives off that vibe at first glance. <br />
<br />
But I was pleasantly surprised by this show. It definitely wasn&#039;t great, but certainly not worthy of being thrown onto the pile of crappy Otome adaptations. And the biggest reason for that, to me, is the MC herself. The show shockingly passes the Bechdel Test and the MC actually does

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358447">
        things for her own reasons. <br />
<br />
Of course, it wouldn&#039;t be an Otome without some pretty boys and while they certainly were pretty, I found myself confusing Victor and Lucien quite a few times. All of the boys had their time to...basically put their hands on the MC and whisper sweet words of devotion to her, all while using their magical, if generic superpowers to protect her from shady guys while she tries to uncover the mystery of her memory loss and her father&#039;s death. <br />
<br />
Overall, I found this show to be better than what it could have been. It looked fine, it sounded fine, the characters were generic but I don&#039;t believe that should mean &quot;bad&quot; . It&#039;s no Next Life as a Villainess and definitely no Yona of the Dawn, but I still enjoyed what I saw.

    This might sound bias but personally, I love the anime as much as I love playing the game. <br />
<br />
Obviously, the game chapters isn&#039;t done yet so we expect that the ending in the anime won&#039;t be satisfactory for other viewers. Those who don&#039;t play the game will surely have many questions, especially during the 2nd half because it&#039;s like it&#039;s been rushed and some scenes were changed.<br />
<br />
In my point of view, I enjoyed watching the anime and it is surely worth your time, though you shouldn&#039;t expect too much or you might as well feel disappointed.<br />
<br />
I just love the anime since I love watching the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review359996">
        characters come to life and how the voice actors did justice to the characters as well.<br />
<br />
I hope the production will take it to their heart to make a 2nd season, I would be truly happy for it.<br />
<br />
Those who haven&#039;t watch this yet, I recommend you to watch it.<br />
<br />
And if you want to really know what happened, you might as well try playing the game. It&#039;s all worth it.

    As someone who played the game I was so happy that it was getting an anime and was looking forward to it, but later on when watching the anime it was not that good as I would have hoped it would.<br />
Story-7<br />
The story was good but it was rushed later on in the series. It did stick to the game story plot so I can&#039;t be that mad about it but I was disappointed in the last episode. <br />
<br />
Art-8<br />
The art did stick to the game design and I really like how each character looked.<br />
<br />
Sound-7<br />
I was hoping that they would use the OST form the game but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review359253">
        it doesn&#039;t bother me that much. The opening and the ending was great I really like how they sound.  <br />
<br />
Charaters-7<br />
The characters was good but they were very underdeveloped, since the anime only had 12 ep the characters didn&#039;t have that much screen time.<br />
<br />
In conclusion the anime was good in my opinion, wish it was 24 ep anime to have more of the characters and being attached to them also for the story to go in an easy peace. Anyways I give the anime 7.<br />
