    If you thought long hair was something of an eye catcher, get a load of this. Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge features a mysterious girl who has probably the longest hair length of almost any anime I&#039;ve seen. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s any sort of accomplishment, but this series takes strange to a new level as there&#039;s a particular young boy who is obsessed with the idea of cutting hair. Now the formula is complete with a young boy who wants to cut hair and a girl who has long hair. Oh but that&#039;s just the tip of the iceberg. Beyond that mountain of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review102523">
        hair also lies danger for our two adorable friends. That doesn&#039;t stop the hair-crossed duo though because in Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge, there&#039;s more than just meets the eye beyond that hair.<br />
<br />
Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge (also known as The Severing Crime Edge) is an animated series adapted from the manga of the same name written by Tatsuhiko Hikagi. The series starts out in a mysterious way but later turns into a dangerous game scenario. The &#039;game&#039; involves whoever can kill the “Hair Queen” and the victor would get a glorious prize for his or her efforts. Sounds catchy right? Well, that would be the case but this series here takes that theme and twist it in a way that can swift from adorable to murderous in just a matter of moments. Talk about change...<br />
<br />
For starters, the series introduces more of a fantasy theme. The mystical encounter between our main protagonists of the story, Kiri Haimura and Iwai Mushanokoji, is quite unusual. It&#039;s not every day that we see people get connected by hair. In fact, what&#039;s even more strange is the length of Iwai&#039;s hair that seemingly is longer than herself. On the other hand, Kiri who seems like a normal boy quickly becomes entranced by that hair. This strange obsession with hair can be traced to borderline fetish as he seemingly can&#039;t take his eyes off of it. It&#039;s the beginning of this relationship connected by hair that sets them as the dynamic duo of this murderous game. <br />
<br />
For the game itself, it seems to follow a winner takes all scenario meaning that it&#039;s every man for themselves. That means one thing: you can&#039;t really trust anyone because of the fear of betrayal. And of course, anime series involving a game scenario similar to this is nothing new. Series such as Mirai Nikki, Btooom!, Fate/Stay Night, Rozen Maiden, etc all follow this sort of format where the ultimate winner of the game is decided based on completing specific requirements. For our adorable Iwai though, the requirement is to kill her. That might sound gruesome but it gets worse because the majority of the contestants are nothing like Kiri. In fact, they can be literally tagged as serial killers. It also doesn&#039;t help the fact that Kiri himself has an origin related to them. The good news is that he seems to be on Iwai&#039;s side more than just that borderline fetish for hair. The bad news? Everyone else seemingly wants our adorable Hair Queen&#039;s head on a plate.<br />
<br />
Although I find the adorable duo to be somewhat compatible, their relationship seems way more like fantasy than anything else. After all, they are connected by a strange encounter in the first place in that western-like mansion. Furthermore though, the two quickly becomes close despite the fact that Iwai is a potential candidate to win the game. He even proves it too as in the beginning, Kiri is able to take on six-foot tall man with just his scissors. He seemingly plays the role of the &#039;knight in shining armor&#039; for our adorable Hair Queen. On the other hand, there&#039;s Iwai who seems to be the mascot of this show. She is so adorable that everyone seems to frown over her cuteness such as her classmates. She has the traits too with those long hair, those moe like eyes, the little fang-shaped teeth, and heart melting smile. However, she lacks the skill or power to protect herself during many situations. Oh and regarding that hair, it&#039;s of course not normal. It has &#039;magic&#039; written all over it and we can see exactly why Kiri-kun seems to be so fascinated by it. <br />
<br />
The people who are hunting down Iwai are known as &#039;Authors&#039; which is a strange name at that. Going by the game scenario though, it&#039;s quite obvious that the Authors wants Iwai dead. The Authors themselves as mentioned earlier before are comparable to professional killers, skilled individuals who kills for his or her own reasons with efficient skill. These individuals themselves are also armed with dangerous weapons known as the &#039;killing goods&#039;. Going by the trademarks, these tools are instruments of killing. In fact, many of the objects in this series are designed in a way to harm people. For example, there&#039;s Kiri and his scissors that also designates the title of the series: the Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge. Then there are the other killing goods that comes in all shapes and sizes such as an injection needle, ropes, and sharp knives. It&#039;s not doubt that these weapons are designed to kill. Yikes, talk about Iwai in a situation of life and death here. But thankfully she has her knight in shining armor right?<br />
<br />
Well that might somewhat be true but it&#039;s clearly seen throughout the series that the duo struggles in their survival against the Authors. Is it because they are weak or because the Authors are too damn strong? I can barely tell since we don&#039;t see much back story of either character besides the basic origins. That&#039;s one of the weaknesses of this show as the connection built by Kiri and Iwai seems too unbelievable. They are connected based on a fascination of &#039;hair&#039; in a fantasy like romance. Speaking of which, the romance between the duo seems to be rather strange. It&#039;s obvious Iwai is attracted to Kiri as well as vice versa. However, neither of them initiates the first move directly but rather expressed through teases; again involving....the magic word &#039;hair&#039;. There&#039;s also hinted romance by another character towards Kiri throughout the series but the kid&#039;s too dense to realize it. Maybe, he&#039;s just too into the hair? I wonder.<br />
<br />
The way the series is structured also seems to follow the typical &#039;monster of the week&#039; format. This is expressed by the way in which some Authors make their debut but then some of them disappears to be never seen or heard of again. Then, there&#039;s the case of Kiri-kun who uses his killing good to protect Iwai. Being her knight in shining armor, Kiri plays the role of the hero kid who tries to do everything by himself. Most of the time he seems to succeed but other times seems to be on the falling edge. While I do like the fact that he isn&#039;t a coward, the way Kiri succeeds sometimes is also a bit unbelievable. Of course, he doesn&#039;t always succeed through Gary Stu-like scenarios but his abilities are quite a sight for the other Authors. He&#039;s proved himself many times already. On the other hand, the Authors who threatens their lives are constant on odds as they struggle to achieve the task of killing the Hair Queen. Their appearances may be diverse but their insights are not as most of their personalities are dull and lacking flavor from my perspective. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s also fan service in this series of course. For whatever reason, the teases in this series expands to not just hair but also in the form of an injection as well. The way in which two particular character behaves in such scenes involving the injection shows a rather lewd way of &#039;bonding&#039;. Then of course, there&#039;s Iwai who sometimes isn&#039;t full dressed and blushes out of nowhere for some eye candy scenes.<br />
<br />
The artwork of this series seems magical. At some stances, it falls under the fantasy theme with the Western-like mansion, the Alice in Wonderland-like field, and stage plays. At other times, it brings out the more modern themes with the school and shopping malls. Then, there&#039;s our characters who are designed to look like normal people but have abnormal ways of expressing themselves. The most noticeable style of artwork is Iwai and her long hair that is eye catching for nearly anyone. Then, there are the Authors. Some of them are designed to look normal and innocent. Others are designed to really look like killers on the loose. <br />
<br />
For soundtrack though, Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge actually has a catchy OST. It&#039;s catchy enough to maintain that magical theme through tense moments as well as those that are intimate. In one particular moment in one of the later episodes, there&#039;s a slow melody that is played to show how far Kiri and Iwai have connected in their relationship. Speaking of which, the voices for our main protagonists expresses themselves well for characters of their age. The OP song &quot;Unmei no Ori&quot; by Aimi shows montages of the various characters. Its tone is expressed in moments in which we see most of the Authors seemingly enduring the situations they are in. Then at the end of each song, there&#039;s the echo of &#039;Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge&#039; giving off a more grim feeling of the series.<br />
<br />
This series can be a hit or miss for potential fans from my perspective. For me, it was a bit of in between but leans more to the mediocre. Aside from the bizarre hair fascination and the weakly structured plot, the series does have some entertainment values at some occasions. It&#039;s also adorable with some of the moments our main two protagonists share throughout the series. At other instances, it becomes old quickly and rather forced rather than expressive. The Authors themselves may distinguish themselves from each other but they don&#039;t have much insight to go on. Ultimately though, the winner of the game will gain glory. What did I gain from Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge? Well, just a barely tolerable experience.

For Haimura Kiri , his fondness for cutting hair has led him to a series of unexpected events stuffed in a peculiar story.Action evolves around these Killing Goods, that are normal objects that have powerful enchantments placed on them that is said to have been placed there by their first owners. As you have guessed these special properties are a means to power and conflict erupts when you fight to the death for a wish granted through a lowly murder leaving you in the end with some questions and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review102653">
        hopes for the future.<br />
Ominous soundtracks back up the very well made fighting scenes that keep up the suspense and sometimes induce the owners feelings.<br />
<br />
Artwork is a pretty impressive work of light and color that create a grand stage for the characters to perform on. Sparing no detail, be it architecture or natural scenery it is really meant to produce an impact on the viewer.<br />
Characters are properly made to express their role through a stunning image, take the Hair Queen for example or Haimura under Graylands influence.<br />
<br />
To my enjoyment all the fighting and suspense really mixed up with the fan service even though it had its own pathetic or odd moments. Personally I believe the feelings of people to be a good template for stories since they can be very powerful and sometimes they exceed the boundaries of human comprehension.<br />

    Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge is a rather recent anime based on a manga by Hikagi Tatsuhiko. The anime was handled by Studio Gokumi, a studio I only know from their work on A Channel. They don&#039;t really have many works yet since they&#039;re a pretty new studio, their first work wasn&#039;t even four years ago. This will be the second anime I&#039;ve seen from them. Let&#039;s see how it compares to the first. <br />
<br />
Our story opens with Kiri, our protagonist, going to the house of a rumoured spirit with long hair because... that&#039;s his fetish. I&#039;m not even kidding. He goes because he has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review132317">
        a hair fetish. When he gets there he finds a petite girl roughly his age with hair down to her feet. He decides to stare at her, scissors in hand while breathing heavily. Contrary to common sense or basic survival skills, the girl, Iwai, decides that the best way to handle the situation is to invite him inside. Because in the land of poorly written characters, actions don&#039;t need to remotely resemble what anyone with a single functional brain cell would do. It turns out that Iwai has cursed hair that can&#039;t be cut. In spite of Kiri trying several pairs of scissors from her drawer. But that&#039;s okay because his pair is magical as it was a murder weapon at some point and it can cut her hair. The worst part is that that isn&#039;t even the stupidest aspect of this series. That&#039;s right, my friends, the idiocy escalates. It turns out that there are lots of people out there with magical murder weapons called authors and if any of them manages to kill Iwai, the “hair queen” they can get any wish they want and escape the spirit of the original murderer that still possesses the weapon. Kiri decides to protect her because she&#039;s surprisingly uncreeped out by him. The series from there follows the pair as they try to fend off a bunch of “authors” who either want to kill Iwai or Kiri. There are many problems that plague the narrative. The most obvious being that the premise is really stupid. Even if it was well-executed, which it isn&#039;t, it would still be just an absurdly stupid premise. Which might work in a parody but they play it seriously and try to play up the “drama.” Which is terribly written and the romance is cringe worthy to the point where it would fit into a Stephanie Meyer novel. I have nothing positive to say about the story. It starts out as mind-numbingly stupid and only gets worse eventually ending on an expositional onslaught about how much more there is to come. <br />
<br />
The characters in this are horribly written. Their actions and motivations have no verisimilitude whatsoever. Kiri has a hair cutting fetish and protects Iwai because he&#039;s in love with her based on her hair. Iwai is an archetypal damsel in distress who spends her time either fixated on her love interest, crying or yelling for help. Most of the characters are defined entirely by exaggerated fetishes and the rest are just one-dimensional. The best characters are the dogs that appear briefly in two or three scenes. Just because they&#039;re the only characters who never do anything grossly stupid or incredibly annoying. To make things even worse, character motivations and actions change quite a bit in this for really flimsy reasons. They really couldn&#039;t use actual character reasons since the characters in this have less personality than a half leaf of lettuce so they have to resort to the tired “characters change because the plot says so.”<br />
<br />
The art is meh. It&#039;s not as bad as the rest of the series, but it&#039;s nothing special. The character designs are pretty standard. The action sequences tend towards the slow, dragged out and uninteresting. They also mute the colours when things get violent. Having fetishy characters, including a pedophile, running around is fine, but showing blood would just be going too far. (Facepalm) There&#039;s really nothing visually interesting about the series. <br />
<br />
The voice acting is pretty bad. Not because of the cast, I&#039;ve heard most of them deliver good performances before, but because the characters have nothing to them. And actors can&#039;t make something out of nothing. As a result, the performances are pretty flat and the actors frequently just sound dis-interested. The music is okay. <br />
<br />
The ho-yay factor is a 3/10. There are a couple homo-erotic scenes between two girls. Unfortunately, those girls are twin sisters. So it just ends up being disgusting. What is with creepy terrible writers and adding romantic subtext to relationships between twins? Looking at you too, Bendis. <br />
<br />
This anime is horrendous. There&#039;s really nothing I can recommend it based on. The writing is terrible, the plot is stupid, the characters are bland at best and downright unpleasant at worst. I could only recommend this one to someone I hated and you&#039;re all such lovely people that I couldn&#039;t do that to you. Final rating 1/10. Next week I&#039;ll take a look at 5 centimetres per second. I know, it&#039;s not on my request queue, but I&#039;m trying to finish Legend of the Galactic Heroes and it&#039;s quite long. Unfortunately, I don&#039;t have anymore requests that are short enough to watch in the meantime. Thank you all for being patient with me. This Friday I&#039;ll do a little something special for all of you. It&#039;s something I&#039;ve wanted to do for a while and now seems a good time. And no, it&#039;s not images of myself in lingerie for Valentine&#039;s. I&#039;m sure most of you would not be interested in seeing that anyway.

    When you take bananas,  macaronni and cheese, pizza, pinnapples, yogurt, carrots, and some jamaican patties put it all into a blender, what would you expect it to taste like.... well if your any person with a normal tastebud then you would say like shit yet this is what this anime blatanly does; Ladies and gents welcome to the anime called Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge other wise known as the severing and dismembering crime edge.<br />
<br />
Kiri Haimura is a seemingly ordinary boy with one slight problem: he is obsessed with cutting other people&#039;s hair. One day he meets Iwai Mushanokōji, the &quot;Hair Queen&quot; who cannot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review98857">
        cut her hair because of an inherited curse. Kiri finds out that his scissor, &quot;Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge&quot; is the only thing that can cut them. But little did he know that their meeting sparked the start of an old murder game to kill the &quot;Hair Queen&quot; using the cursed killing tools, the &quot;Killing Goods&quot;<br />
<br />
This show feels alot like a mix between shakugan no shana, fate stay night, and mirai nikki but adds in its own twist with its obsession with &quot;hair.&quot; Yes the hair is everything in this anime, the main character has an obsession with cutting &quot;hair&quot;, the female protag is a shy loli with uncuttable &quot;hair&quot; however the male protag is able to cut this hair with scissors which he also uses to kill his enemies.... UNSANITARY<br />
<br />
story(5) its really nothing new after the rise of the hunger games it seems like i&#039;ve been seeing alot more death match styled animes for some reason from mirai nikki to higashi no eden, to fate Zero. There is a fundamental difference however to this style of &quot;death Match&quot; as everyone wants to kill &quot;THE HAIR QUEEN&quot; or in other words there is a focal point which makes this anime more like a good versus bad since the main protagonist is the &quot;protector&quot; while everyone else is an &quot;aggressor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Art (6) Decent artwork is done here buy studio Gokumi which isn&#039;t really well known for any other anime other than A-channel.... This is defintily a step up but there are very obvious cuts that are made such as the moments when there is about to be a fight scene the screen fades to a grey meaning there is no other color except for this gray hue that fills the screen which gets very annoying, its a very direct way of saying &quot;HEY A FIGHT SCENE LOOK HERE&quot; <br />
<br />
Sound (7) soundtrack is probably the best thing about this anime as it has a very well done opening and ending as well as some good soundtracks sprinkled here and there. Nothing however was groundbreaking or blew me away. The voice acting is... okay feels like im watching an old shounen anime, something along the lines of inuyasha with devious character lines and laughter with the main character spending alot of time yelling, screaming, or screeching for more power.<br />
<br />
characters (3) -sigh- A miss for me the characters are plastic and have no life to me, they feel like they&#039;ve been taken out of other notable anime and simply injected into the storyline to fit there needs. Male protag is as generic as generic goes, hes one of those hero types who acts super normal and super bland but then action scenes start, snip snapadoodle he&#039;s a cutting machine able to take down legions of fellows just for the sake of being awesome. Main female protag (notice how im not using any names in this review) is simply a loli that plays the princess peach role I swear half of the seyuu&#039;s role is to cry out the male protags name &#039;KIRI-KUN&quot; and sound like she&#039;s crying, she cries during every fight scene, looks at the stars like a good little girl, super wishful and kinda strong willed when the male protag gets hurt saying things like &quot;YOU HURT KIRI-KUN I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU.)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment(5) this shows is trying on to many different masks and doesn&#039;t know which one suits it the best as it goes for death match, romance, slice of life, comedy, with horror, fantasy, and mysterious elements. Its just trying to balance way to many things for a relatively new studio like Studio Gokumi to handle. Most of the enjoyable moments for me was when the girl&#039;s hair is being cut as i know that at this very second there are people watching this using it as masturbation material as the scenes which the girls hair is getting cut is highly sexualized and romanticized like to the point where you think the characters are about to bust a load if Kiri-kun takes one more snip of hair.<br />
<br />
Overall (5) this is what i feel is a BAD anime that just tries on to many different things all at the same time without having an objective of what it wants to be.<br />
This anime is nothing special and ultimately was destined to fail even prior to the release of its 3rd episode as it was imminent that the staff couldn&#039;t focus on a goal for this show.

    Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge: What&#039;s Your Fetish?<br />
<br />
What happens when you combine Rapunzel and Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni with a generic moe romantic comedy? You get Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge, one of the most awkward anime series I&#039;ve seen in quite some time. Awkward and campy are the best ways to describe it since trying to put this series into one genre is a damn near impossibility, on top of the odd elements this series tries to explore.<br />
<br />
The series revolves around a rather strange junior high student with a hair fetish named Kiri Haimura, a possessor of a pair of scissors known as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review102623">
        a Killing Good. These Killing Goods are murder weapons for killers in the past and are passed down to their kin throughout the ages. Kiri isn&#039;t the most accepting of his Killing Good, but his opinion quickly changes of it when he encounters a sheltered girl with extremely long hair named Iwai Mushiyanokouji. Upon meeting her, he learns that she is cursed and her hair cannot be cut. She is known as the Hair Queen and that she is the target of a group named Gossip. Since he possesses a pair of scissors with a unique circumstance, he attempts to cut her hair with it...and their adventures begin from there.<br />
<br />
Overall, I found the strongest aspect of this series was the atmosphere built from the great animation and music. This series did a masterful job of balancing out the comedy, romance, and thriller elements to make for a strangely intriguing series. The &quot;awkwardness&quot; of this series is actually what I thought to be its greatest strength. It&#039;s rare to find an anime that tries to blend the genres like Crime Edge attempted, and to some extent, it succeeded. While the atmosphere was fantastic for Crime Edge, it had a lot of flaws.<br />
<br />
Generally, the characters I thought were good, but underdeveloped. Kiri was an interesting lead as an awkward, but likable protagonist. However, considering his background, I wanted to know more about his back story as well as his relationship with his father. It&#039;s a subject that&#039;s barely touched upon in the first episode and we don&#039;t ever see it again throughout the series. We do see some interactions between Kiri and his grandfather, but it doesn&#039;t do much to develop Kiri&#039;s character. Unfortunately, Iwai&#039;s character suffered the same problem. She is a likable character, but unfortunately her back story is not very well developed even though the series does give some general explanations early on and also later on in the series. Even then, it was still lacking. In my opinion, the relationship development between Kiri and Iwai was extremely awkward, almost seeming as if the director wasn&#039;t sure if he should be more aggressive or passive in their development...and in the end, it turns out being just awkward. The supporting cast I found to be okay. I wouldn&#039;t say there are a lot of memorable characters, but I will admit there are some that have interesting personality quirks. A few examples include Yamane with her awkwardly serious behavior, Emily&#039;s rather bipolar behavior, as well as the intriguing duo of Seigi and Kozakura, an Author with a jaded sense of justice and an Instead on a mission to keep him inline. Don&#039;t get me started on Kanae either, a mysterious character with...oddly enough, a lolita complex.<br />
<br />
While I did think the animation was the strongest aspect of this series, the direction of it was a bit off-putting. There are some anime out there that you can consider ecchi...and then there&#039;s Crime Edge...which beats you over the head with a 2x4 of ecchi and fan service. While I don&#039;t mind the ecchi at times and found it to work in some instances, it seems like this series went WAY overboard with it. It&#039;s one thing to have ecchi with older, high school characters or adults, but it&#039;s a completely other thing when a majority of the ecchi is revolving around children that are 14-years-old or younger. There were times I seriously felt dirty for watching this knowing the characters were so young and are being so exposed. Like I said, there were times when the ecchi and fan service worked in the context of the series, but the producers seemed to hammer it in when they didn&#039;t need to. I&#039;d even go so far as to call the production staff behind this series downright perverts.<br />
<br />
As far as the plot and story are concerned, I did find it interesting, or at the very least, interesting enough to hold my attention. However, I felt this series didn&#039;t quite do enough to cover the bases in regards to explaining the Murderer&#039;s Game. It&#039;s explanation is extremely fragmented and round-a-bout. While it&#039;s explanation does make sense, it seems very impractical and I found myself groaning at just how stupid Gossip&#039;s logic was concerning the Murderer&#039;s Game.<br />
<br />
My general thoughts on this series are...meh, it&#039;s okay. This series has an interesting aura about it with a nice blend of lighthearted atmosphere with extremely dark moments. It&#039;s animation (when taking the story seriously) is very good and the soundtrack is haunting at times. However, for everything good the atmosphere does with this series, it manages to always seem to take a step back with its horrifically padded fan service and unnecessary ecchi...thus, also resulting in some underdeveloped characters. This is a series that really had me hooked early on and kept me interested throughout, but as the series wore on, so did my patience with the director&#039;s antics. This series had the potential to be really good and it turned out being just average. On top of that, it left us on a mini-cliffhanger for a 2nd season. While I wasn&#039;t blown away by Crime Edge, I&#039;d be interested in checking out a 2nd season if it does happen. Recommending this series to anyone would be difficult though considering how blended the genres are in this series. If you liked a show like Tasogare Otome x Amnesia or Sankarea, you might enjoy a series like this. Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge, despite its flaws, is a rather unique series. Overall, I&#039;d call it average though. You can certainly do better than this series and you can certainly do worse as well. Still, it&#039;s at least worth trying out a few episodes to see if it is your cup of tea.

    While titles like Gargantia and Attack on Titan stand out among the Spring 2013 anime list, The Severing Crime Edge is one that completely drew my attention. The anime has a creepy theme where everything is nice and happy yet you know that something is up. The anime ties is many themes, and this makes it watchable for all audiences. <br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
<br />
The story is of very mixed-genre that ties in many common anime themes. The show starts out with a creepy slice-of-life theme that is so sweet and cute, but then gains a shonen aspect that involves something like a Mirai Nikki killing game. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review96239">
        show is very mixed and while bloody and creepy, it is also sweet and adorable. But unfortunately sometimes the story can get mushy and lame, so the battling and romance are inconsistent. <br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
<br />
It&#039;s modern animation. Lots of colors. Not much to say here but the artwork is very good. it exceeds almost everything before its time.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is what ties in the themes of the anime. The sound consists of slow jazz that speeds up during the creepy parts. Because of this, the music ties in perfectly with the setting and alters itself with the setting. The opening isn&#039;t much to brag about though.<br />
<br />
Character: 7/10<br />
<br />
The character designs are great. They fit the part exactly. The main character&#039;s face looks exactly like Edward Elric&#039;s. One interesting thing is that there isn&#039;t a whole lot of character background for the protagonist. We know that he likes to cut hair but we don&#039;t know much about school or anything. I kinda like this, as it makes the story stick to the plot<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
<br />
My favorite genre is shonen or action. However, I like romance as well, as long as there&#039;s no drama. This was why I loved SAO so much as it was a fantasy action theme but there was some cute love story inside of it. The Severing Crime Edge is just the same. It harbors a creepy action plot but the protagonist is doing everything for the sake of a girl that he is trying to help just to be a nice guy.<br />
<br />
Overall I really enjoyed this anime. I look forward to watching it to the end and that it becomes more popular as many people will enjoy it.<br />

    Blood, gore, violence. Did any of these words attribute to what you read the synopsis or upon first glance of the accompanying image? Well this is what the anime is truly about, not some oversimplified plot where a guy with a hair-cutting fetish protects a girl who has long uncuttable hair. That&#039;s just the pretence set by the first episode, and due to this pretence it shatters the actual story of the anime; a murderous life-threatening game of protector vs protectorates or the so-called Gossip.<br />
<br />
Story. If you watched the first episode, it doesn&#039;t do ANY justice to this anime whatsoever. The story is not about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review102931">
        some maniac who wants to cut hair to the point where the stupidly ignores reality. No, this story is about how ordinary people who learn about their criminal ancestors get thrown into a game of life-and-death, and the consequences stemming from each decision. But also, it is a story of Romance. Romance is portrayed quite readily throughout the anime, as a soothing position between the violence. The romantic link between the two main characters, strengthens the story&#039;s credibility, meaning that the boy with the hair-fetish, isn&#039;t protecting a girl out of simple interest of cutting hair, no that&#039;s just not credible. Although I&#039;m making a few round-a-bout points, the simple statement is thus. The story is not about what the first episode implies, it&#039;s much more than that. And it&#039;s so refreshing to see that the main character isn&#039;t some push-over chump who gets beaten to a pulp by every villian he encounters; he&#039;s actually quite a &#039;badass.&#039; So for those of you who want to watch a gore anime filled with violence, romance, and fantasy. I invite you to watch this anime.<br />
<br />
Moving on, the Art in this anime is quite buoyant (cute) in that it seems much more &#039;kinder&#039; and attempts to reconcile it&#039;s very dark themes with a familiarity of simpletonism (gullibility that the world is kind). In that it tries to warm the audience to the very troubling, gore scenes of the anime that nobody would&#039;ve guessed would become due to the very contradictory first episode. I think this is a small mistake, but in all honesty, it doesn&#039;t detract much from the anime much. For example, the main character, who is probably the most &#039;evil&#039; person in the anime, doesn&#039;t appear evil in fact he seems like a wimp more than a brute. But that&#039;s just a minor detail.<br />
<br />
Sound is quite well done in the anime, there are times where I felt my heart skip a beat due the circumstances of the situation, and then I realised, it was the music. The ending and opening seem to be quite well done, but it was quite confusing, for the same reason as above, it seems so melodramatic for seemingly for reason, but made perfect sense as the anime progressed.<br />
<br />
Kiri-kun, the main character. I liked the fact that he was such a strong protagonist as he started off, but in all honesty, it made no sense why he was so powerful the moment he started fighting, though the anime explains it in terms of &#039;killing goods&#039; and bloodlust and etc. It didn&#039;t all mesh together quite nicely. But it did explain &#039;kind of&#039; how Kiri was so strong as he started fighting the &#039;authors&#039; after his precious queen. The characterisation seems to quite strange, in that he was able to so easily move from normal life to killing and bloodshed with no conscience and then ironically in the final episode states that authors have &quot;no sense of life and death.&quot; It pricked my sides a bit in that regard, but just another minor detail. On a side note, the narrator at times seems to be quite worthless, and side characters in the anime seem to be almost ephemeral, you only ever see them once. The characterisation of the &#039;hair queen&#039; seems to be almost impossible, how could a girl who has never had outside contact with the rest of the world, magically blend in to society within hours? And then go on to having a boyfriend, and becoming a popular girl a school. Very incredible. But she was no doubt crucial to the story, I believe the author wanted to show that she was re-integrating into society, but at such a fast rate seems to be impossible. While it did try and show her struggling at times, it didn&#039;t seem to be any difficult hurdle; in that it was passed almost instantaneously. Lastly though, Kiri-kun simply becomes another overpowered character such as ichigo in Bleach, while it&#039;s awesome to see strong characters, allowing them to actually have wit in fighting situations or overcome difficult fights without giving another power would be much more interesting. So characterisation is very poorly done.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment, I loved the anime, though I can see its innumerable flaws. It has many, many mistakes which detracted the feel of the anime, and for some scenes it seems like it was entirely useless in explaining the anime&#039;s story or revealing the past. So I can say that I really enjoyed the anime, its story, and the romance and to a lesser extent its characters.<br />
<br />
So the verdict. Due to the impossible characterisation of the characters, as well as the purposeless art details, I would give the anime a 5. But the anime has quite a good story, it had great depth, and had a thorough explanation of everything that occurred in the anime, as in it explained the enemies&#039; powers, whom they got it from, etc. It had great detail and put great effort into putting detail into its story and overall the anime is a 8. <br />
<br />
If you&#039;ve read this far, as always, thanks you for reading!<br />

    “Kiri-kun, you’re the first one to kill me!”<br />
<br />
If I had to describe this anime in 3 words, it’d easily be “out of place”. It seems they tried to incorporate so many things into this short series, leaving you with a very fast-paced, poorly executed mess of out-of-place fanservice, actions, animations, and story elements. <br />
<br />
Story: (4 / 10)<br />
If you read the synopsis for this series, and you’re expecting an intense killing game involving these cursed “killing goods”, then you might as well leave right away, because this is not at all what the show is about. <br />
Well, that’s not completely true as this deadly game is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review103667">
        the underlying (or overlying?) plot for most things that happen in the series, but there’s no progression in the story, or any kind of wrap-up at the end. <br />
<br />
In each episode, the two main characters, Kiri &amp; Iwai, will go somewhere, be attacked by an author (an owner of killing goods), defeat them, and then it’s over. <br />
The story is littered with plot-holes, and out-of-place events, but one thing that really bugs me is how all the authors talk about how they must be the one killing the Hair Queen (since killing her will grant you any wish), but none of them actually do anything... <br />
There’s more or less one character in the entire show who actually tries to kill Iwai, but he has about 5 minutes of screen time, tops, and not a single line of dialog. All of the other characters just seem to dawdle, or just attack Kiri instead.<br />
<br />
As an example, Byouinzaka and her sister took care of, and were the only ones (of the authors atleast) who knew the whereabouts of Iwai, yet for years they didn’t ever think about killing her, and when Kiri shows up they’re actively trying to protect her instead?<br />
<br />
The plot is filled with things like this, and there were several times where the MC should’ve died, but he didn’t because then they obviously couldn’t continue the series... <br />
<br />
Art: (4 / 10)<br />
This series was at most pretty average looking. There’s really not that much detail in neither backgrounds nor characters, and for a show so focused on hair, it doesn’t feel like they put much time into making it look good at all. <br />
Yet again, a lot of animations feel very out-of-place, and don’t fit in with the voicing or with what’s currently going on. In fact, it made for a pretty annoying experience, having these “off”-feeling animations constantly ruin any mood or tension set by the ongoing events. <br />
<br />
Another thing that bothered me was the fact that every fighting scene in the first 3/4 would be saturated, with only a tint of color, which would vary from fight to fight. Then, when the fight was over, all color would return. Was this the effect of the killing goods, because if it was, that’s yet another thing that was never explained. However, it seems during the final few fights, they dropped this effect, and just kept all the color.<br />
<br />
And then ofcourse we have the fanservice. Oh god, the amount of fanservice in this show completely ruin the notion of it all being a dark killing game, and it makes for pretty awkward situations.<br />
<br />
Sound: (5 / 10)<br />
The opening theme, “Unmei no Ori” performed by Aimi, would be perfect at setting the tone for the anime, if the show was actually as dark and sinister as it tries to be. The ending theme, on the other hand, is a rather happy song, yet it feels more fitting to the series, than the opening does.<br />
<br />
As for the voice acting, I can’t really say it was very good, to be honest. As I mentioned earlier, a lot of the voicing didn’t fit in with the animations, but even at other times there were times when it would just feel off.<br />
I think the biggest cause of this was that the voice actors were all very “stale”, as if they were actually trying to hold in the emotions that they should’ve used. There’s barely any emotion among any of the characters (with some exceptions, ofcourse), a lot of the dialog just feels dull, and coupled with the out-of-place animations, it all makes for an almost painful experience...<br />
<br />
Characters: (4 / 10)<br />
Honestly, the characters aren’t anything spectacular either. There’s barely any development, and a lot of interactions between characters are just weird. It seems they tried to give each character their own unique characteristic, and they really try to force it onto you, so that you’ll really notice it.<br />
<br />
For instance, Kiri’s obsession with hair (and not just cutting it, as is first implied), is often forced into scenes, and he will kiss &amp; lick it, among other things, which makes for even more out-of-place content. In fact, there’s quite a lot of random licking in this show...<br />
<br />
It also seems like they wanted to fit in as many stereotypes as they could manage. Ranging from the lolicon professor, to the cold-hearted sister, to a cute and innocent police officer, as well as the tsundere classmate, just to name a few. The problem with this, is that most of them are so poorly done. <br />
A perfect example is the tsundere classmate. At completely inappropriate situations, she will shout some generic tsundere line, with the most emotionless voice acting and most off animations ever, and it’s very painful to watch, every time she does this...<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: (3 / 10)<br />
I feel like the concept of this show really had potential, and it’s really too bad to see it ruined by the sloppy writing and execution. I think it needed to not be nearly as fast paced, and thus also be longer (~24 episodes), while also fixing much of the out-of-place stuff that plagues the series. <br />
<br />
Granted, there were some characters (Emily) I liked, and some of the fighting scenes and abilities shown were pretty cool (Rulebook), but it all fell apart, sadly. <br />
There were also a few funny moments for me, but unfortunately I can’t say these were probably intended by the creators, as it was more about the less than average execution of some scenes...<br />
<br />
So, this is yet another show I personally wouldn’t even touch with a 10-foot pole...

    Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge by Studio Gokumi was springs 2013 attempt to create a horror-gothic action show with brutal murderers fighting over the death of the Hair Queen.<br />
<br />
What sounds like a promising show turns to be a rather sad effort in making it as good as it sounds.<br />
While I appreciate the goth-atmosphere the show had, it had some serious issues.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Dansai Bunri revolves around the middleschooler Kiri Haimura, who comes into contact with the so called Hair Queen, Iwai Mushanokouji. Kiri has magical scissors which allow him to cut the Hair Queens very long non-cutable hair. Through this they become a semi couple and Kiri

          <span style="display: none;" id="review103009">
        has to protect her against her enemies, other people with so called Killing Goods, just like Kiris magical scissors.<br />
Problem though is, that this game of hunters trying to kill the Hair Queen is presented in a very strange way, as Dansai Bunri switches from dark to light in a blink of an eye.<br />
The characters do silly moe reactions, the overall tone is inconsistent and borderline retarded at times.<br />
If this was some silly school anime with cute girls doing cute things it would have been okay.<br />
But the themes in Dansai Bunri try to be more serious and on the darker side, so it utterly fails to create any sort of atmosphere.<br />
<br />
The pacing is pretty bad, switching from very slow to very fast, but overall felt rushed by the end. The makers come along as amateurs who have no idea how to properly tell a story, stretching some scenes into infinite while rushing everything else as if they were in a hurry.<br />
<br />
Not only that but they also have a hard time giving the themes and world enough time to sink properly in. Not that it would matter if we knew more about the lore behind it since the show throws it all out at any point in time they squeeze in slapstick and moe jokes...<br />
<br />
Because of that the overall plot feels very weak and nonsensical. And not only that it also ends in a preview for a second season...<br />
<br />
Good though were some of the darker elements of the show, it had plenty of blood and A LOT of sexual tension.<br />
It was my personal guilty pleasure of the show, since it was pretty bold and would fit in into a gothic like show like Dansai Bunri tries to be. But as mentioned it couldn&#039;t really deliver in that department.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Kiri is our protagonist, a middleschooler with magic scissors and a Hairfetish (how convenient).<br />
There isn&#039;t much to say about him, we don’t really know much about his life or ideals, other than his past has something to do with the most brutal murderer of all history and he is love with the main heroine Iwai. His character is very childish and naive and I cannot say he is a good protagonist.<br />
<br />
Iwai is the so called Hairqueen and besides being nice to people who try to kill her, she is also in love with Kiri. She is weak and never does anything throughout the show but being saved by Kiri.<br />
<br />
There are also a bunch of different characters but I don’t really find it necessary to mention any of them, as they are all quite dull and only have their gimmicks that define their characters. Most of them don’t even show up more than 1 or a few times.<br />
The entire cast feels very childish and panders to a younger audience, or mental children, since the themes of the show are not suited for kids.<br />
<br />
It’s such a strange dichotomy. The show has all this sexual tension, gore and darkness going on, but is presented in such a moe, slice of life way. The cast is retarded and they all act so cartoony it’s really weird.<br />
<br />
Art and Animation<br />
<br />
The art in Dansai Bunri is nothing to be in awe. Everything looks very generic and bland, no great talents worked on this and Studio Gokumi isn&#039;t really known for their high profile stuff.<br />
<br />
The animation quality isn&#039;t bad but also not great. It has some good action scenes here and there but mostly wastes its screen time on fanservice and silly chibi faces.<br />
<br />
The backgrounds are all totally uninteresting and just blur in with the rest, no effort was made to create an immersive world with great gothic art that fits its themes.<br />
<br />
The worst though must be the character designs. They all look really cheap. Their faces totally deformed and some of the look just atrocious.<br />
Why does Kiri have such a bad haircut if he is into cutting hair?<br />
I credit them for giving Iwai a different hairstyle every other episode, but that’s it. The character designs are really bad and childish looking. At least they are sometimes moe.<br />
<br />
Besides the bad character designs, the censoring (in the TV version) is also terrible. Bloody scenes were in black and white, and the fanservice we got had “magical white light” shining over it so we don’t see what’s going on... sad sad sad. But I will check out the BD version to see if at least that one has no censorship. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
At least the sound department doesn&#039;t suck.<br />
<br />
We get okay voice actors nothing great to mention here.<br />
But the opening is one of my favorites of the season, it’s not great or anything but pretty catchy. The ending was also quite okay, but not as good as the opening<br />
<br />
The rest of the soundtrack was neither bad nor good, it was quite solid but not really outstanding or worth listening to.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
Though Dansai Bunri was a pretty bad show with a lot of problems I still could enjoy it here and there.<br />
At one point I almost dropped it but the Loli Arc got me into it again.<br />
The best was probably the fanservice and sexual tension it had to offer. Some really weird fetishes were going on here and the scenes were sometimes pretty intense. Too bad it was censored.<br />
It was also quite reckless with killing people or at least injuring them really badly. For such a childish show it was pretty grim, I enjoyed that as well.<br />
<br />

Conclusion:<br />
<br />
Wasted ideas and themes is all that Dansai Bunri is. If you are looking for a good action show, turn away. If you want some weird fanservice you might get something out of this. But overall it was a pretty bad show.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
+ Bold sexual scenes<br />

<br />
Cons:<br />
- weak story presentation<br />

<br />

    the purpose of this review is to give a concise, yet detailed overview of Dansai Buri no Crime Edge, while trying not to be too opinionated and subjective as possible. As well as refraining from using strict numbers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: Good (about a 7)<br />
The storyline is actually not that bad, and it doesnt contain a mountain of plot-holes like in other series. The concept is rather interesting as well, as the person who kills the &quot;Hair Queen&quot; gets their wish fulfilled, and this is turned into a game to see who kills her. Though the concept of a murder game is not original, at all, because anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review105031">
        like Deadman Wonderland and Mirai Nikki came first, and honestly are a lot more brutal and nerve-wrecking than Crime Edge. However, the story wont fail to entertain you and it still creates a nice blend of macabre-like themes and dark elements adding its flavor to the show, and giving it more of a murder game feel.Another aspect of the story that adds to Crime Edge&#039;s appeal is how the characters fight...as they wield a murdering tool from one of their ancestors....and fights range from people using knives...to people fighting with syringes and scissors.Though this concept is not completely original  either, its taken into a new light and adds nice suspense to the story. Though, the reason im giving it this score is because of 2 things: 1) even though they are middle schoolers, this anime has an unbelievable amount of sexual innuendos leading to things that shouldnt be censored, censored; and 2) The first 3 episodes of the anime were honestly, a turn-off. You must bear for those 3, before wanting to drop, and continue to watch, it gets better.<br />
<br />
Art: Good ( about a 7)<br />
the art style for this anime fit the overall mood. the art was down in dark, sometimes gloomy colors, adding to the macabre-like appeal to the show.The animation is not disappointing and it rather remarkable when it comes to the fight scenes which really is exciting. Though, if you notice, on some backgrounds they were kinda &quot;lazy&quot; and inconsistent in quality on and that also applies to the background characters too.<br />
<br />
Sound: Good (about a 7)<br />
the sound is pretty good overall. the OP fits the show and is actually quite catchy, as you would want to listen to it every single time you watch the anime...and not skip over it. The ED is so-and-so, you can love it or hate it. The OST is not too shabby, though some music seems a bit out of place during key scenes. The voices for the characters are not bad, Iwai&#039;s voice is probably the best overall, and the other voices are not annoying or atrocious so its fine in that department. <br />
<br />
Character: Very Good (about an 8)<br />
Dansai Buri no Crime Edge is soo weird to tell you the truth. But its out of this weirdness that these characters are oddly appealing. Its hard to put into words why you like these characters so much but you just do for whoever knows why. The character&#039;s personalities themselves are not too special, though they are different and you have to appreciate that. You have Kiri here who will do anything for Iwai to save her, a true gentleman in that regard, but has an extreme hair fetish, like he REALLY loves hair, no joke. This is just an example of the quirkiness of these characters, yet you dont hate or dislike Kiri, but you guiltily like him, if you know what i mean?<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Very Good (about an 8)<br />
i do say, this was a weirdly enjoyable series. Despite its overly use of sexual innuendos and &quot;secretly sexually-appealing&quot; female characters ( i use quotes because they are not really sexually appealing, or at least you dont want to think of them in that way, yet they are)....Dansai Buri no Crime Edge is a great watch. It has a nice blend of serious, plot driven scenes, and good humor that isnt forced or out of place. The fight scenes are really something to see, as the fluid animation really perks up these key scenes; plus its really cool seeing someone fight deathmatches with a pair of scissors.<br />
<br />
Overall: Very Good (about an 8)<br />
mentioned before about the characters, the same is with the whole series. You dont know why you like it, you just do. its weirdness and eccentric-ness latches onto you and before you know it you are hooked. Like a guilty pleasure of an anime to watch. I will admit, i had my doubts that i would like it this much, but dont take my word on it, watch it for yourself and see what you think. I will say this series is a memorable one and is personally one of my tops. This will be memorable for you too; for better,or for worst.<br />
<br />
So think you for reading my review and i hoped it helped you in your anime watching decisions.<br />

    .........Hummm, that was interesting to watch, so how could I describe this dark drama, I&#039;d probably say that it&#039;s fair enough to watch. Anyways (oops, my bad the adverb &quot;anyway&quot;  wasn&#039;t suppose to pluralize)I kinda find this dark drama a bit interesting since this anime has a combination of the following: S &amp; M, perverse simulated sex, suspense and horror all combine to make up for this anime&#039;s story, which is why I call it a &quot;Dark Drama,&quot; thought the subjects of this anime&#039;s focus was on the curse objects called &quot;Killing Goods&quot; one can&#039;t help that the main feature was on Iwai. Now

          <span style="display: none;" id="review102641">
        the story may have some similarities with your usual damsel in distress,  Iwai fate was a bit different since there are some episode where she has to save her knight in shinning scissor, Kiri. I did mentioned about this anime&#039;s combinations of its story, the S &amp; M part here is about them author satisfying their blood lust on their instead, now that where the perverse simulated sex comes to play, the problem is  that it&#039;s just wasn&#039;t intense enough though it was a bit gruesome to see them instead taking the suffering and not getting killed, then again watching such scene was like watching porn were the orgasm was obviously fake. So let&#039;s get down to my rating for each of this anime&#039;s category:<br />
<br />
<br />
Story, art, overall: Fair 6.<br />
<br />
At one point I really like the story&#039;s dark drama theme, however, there are thing that where not explain, like, how did Iwai&#039;s hair stopped growing in ep. 10 and what are the factors that dictate as to how her cursed hair grows? Why didn&#039;t the Byōinzaka sisters do way with Iwai in the first place and take the wish for themselves? Also, why does the Byōinzaka sisters refers to themselves as twins (ep. 2) when they&#039;re neither identical nor fraternal? Overall, though the anime is good, it has a lot of loose ends, for the art.....I just have nothing much to say, though the Iwai is cute, her fanservice was just too pervasive for me.<br />
<br />
Sound, character and enjoyment: Good 7.<br />
<br />
I like the opening theme, but not the closing. I like the VA&#039;s who did Kiri, Iwai, Hoko and Emi. The character&#039;s....... well, I like it that Iwai is this cute damsel in distress and Kiri being this knight holding a shiny scissor. but as for the Byōinzaka sisters, one can&#039;t determine if they&#039;re the good girls or bad girls waiting for the right moment, same with the professor, let&#039;s face most of the characters here are also part of this anime&#039;s loose ends, even so, this anime still has that sweet side of Iwai that make this anime good enough to enjoy.<br />
<br />
So, will this anime have a season 2, well, it looks like it. Peace Muchachos!

    First off: The anime is not about hair.<br />
<br />
     Now that that is out of the way time to start a proper review. The animation quality isn&#039;t eye catching at all, somehow around the ending episodes of the anime they added so much &#039;shine&#039; to the character&#039; eyes that it would just look out of place. The characters are; overall, pretty good. I cant complain, they&#039;re down to earth (most of them) and seem relatable.<br />
     When ep1 came out it seemed pretty normal and basic to me. Around ep3 or it went into that &#039;kill the other guys

          <span style="display: none;" id="review102127">
        that are like you&#039; plot *cough* Mirai Nikki *cough*; then my enjoyment picked up because I find killing games entertaining. All in all, the anime overall was pretty good it all flowed nicely; and if there was a season two I would watch it.

    With a unique storyline and engaging characters, Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge is definitely an anime worth watching. <br />
<br />
It might seem complicated and complex at first, but the anime runs on a simple and easy to understand plot, which allowed me to get used to the characters without focusing to much on trying to figure out the plot. It got a bit predictable towards the end, but there are plenty of unexpected surprises that make up for it. The episodes all felt connected, and the right amount of comedic moments were mixed in with action scenes, yet the plot continuously moved on. Some topics explored

          <span style="display: none;" id="review144173">
        in the anime may make some people uncomfortable, but can usually be overlooked. Overall, the ending was pretty good and delivered enough closure, but it hinted at a second season that has yet to be announced (unfortunately).<br />
<br />
The style of the art is nothing too special, but it is memorable and the characters are recognizable. Personally, I feel that the style matches the storyline pretty well, and the designs for each character were drawn well. They were unique as well, so it was easy to tell different characters apart. The only thing I have to complain about is that most of the fight scenes were not fully colored, and only used a few basic shades of color. The animators probably did that for effect (or they got lazy), but either way, I would&#039;ve liked to see the fight scenes colored. <br />
<br />
The theme song for this anime is one of the best that I&#039;ve ever heard. The sound effects are done well, and the background music doesn&#039;t take away from the dialogue either. It was nothing breathtaking, but nothing to complain about either. <br />
<br />
Most of the characters were easily likable, even the ones that appear to be &#039;evil&#039;. None of them were Mary Sues or Gary Stus, and they each had their own flaws and special characteristics. The amount of characters was just enough so that I didn&#039;t have to scramble around to remember everyone&#039;s name. <br />
<br />
Honestly speaking, this is one of my favorite animes by far. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who doesn&#039;t have too many triggers they need to be wary of, and I think that many people would enjoy this series. Everyone I&#039;ve recommended this anime to so far has come back to be with positive response. Unfortunately, the fanbase for this anime isn&#039;t very large since it&#039;s not that popular, but hopefully people will continue to enjoy it. <br />

    Haimura Kiri looks like an ordinary boy from the outside but he is actually a person with a hair cutting obsession, and a severe one at that. He wants to cut sweet lady hair to satisfy himself and for that purpose he carries a scissor And one day he meets The Queen of Hair- a girl who couldn&#039;t cut her hair. Sounds like a perfect match right? <br />
<br />
Story: This story is one of those that messes up the audiences emotions, it&#039;s hard to think that the mangaka pitied any of the characters. The story elements fits together and have enormous plot twists. The Romance scenes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review167883">
        of this one is very superb. Like it or not hints of ecchi and harem can be found. The whole story is a balance between horror,cuteness and psychology-an unusual combination. However,Combined together it gave out an interesting story which cannot be found everyday. Also Sadism plays a significant role in the story setting- so seeing very cute characters in a way that you can&#039;t expect is very rare and ironical. Horror is also main conduit in here- however i think it&#039;s because of the character setting it didn&#039;t seem to be scary but rather mind boggling. <br />
<br />
Art: Art is good. There was a tokyo ghoul reference-- i won&#039;t mention which episode. Characters were drawn beautifully- i especially liked Iwa&#039;s eyes and hair- that unique rich green colour was so eye candy. The atmosphere around this one was very strong- the scenic pieces were drawn well and it&#039;s hard to explain but you just got to feel it to know it yourself. <br />
<br />
Sound: The opening and ending were average- nevertheless had a good meaning. Some of the soundtracks were created to suit the emotions and the atmosphere. The Seiyus did well on this one- especially Kiri&#039;s voice was done very well. <br />
<br />
Character: Unless you count Gasai Yuno it&#039;s very hard to find Yandere characters in random anime. Mostly because when involving that type you gotta deal with a lot of settings change and mood. There were characters that looked minor but played the most important roles in the anime like that Police lady is a good example. Most characters were simply adorable and the male lead was a gentleman he vaguely reminded me of Maebara Keiichi. Also sadists/masochists/perverts/witches and religious freaks can be found so prepare yourself for a good mind boggle. Latter to be said about the two main characters- the hair goddess is a very cute- caring girl who is cursed. The severing scissor guy is the most surprising. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Due to the setting changes and epic plot twists i&#039;d have to say i really enjoyed this one even though it was very fast paced. There was some light humour and reverse scenes which you would never expect and of course would make you vomit(I&#039;m not literally talking about the gore here)<br />
<br />
Overall: The whole anime puts out the moral that some obsessions are genetic than habitual, actually it could be true. It also derived a huge realities in life which conflicted with the fantasy elements. You could say that the mangaka is very judgemental and open minded about the society.  Obviously there was an epic cliffhanger in the last two episodes and as this was a promotive piece so you couldn&#039;t expect much. Although at some point this anime was everywhere but nowhere since it had so many contrasting elements that clashed with each other.

    Crime Edge was definitely a pretty trippy experience. It takes the typical “people battle to the death” concept that we’ve seen with Fate/Zero and Mirai Nikki and makes it unique. Whether that’s bad or good has completely polarized the few people that bothered watching this. Though the viewers who would argue that Crime Edge is a “bad” show have taken majority, I take my place with my minority.<br />
<br />
I’m not going to argue with the majority because Crime Edge really is chocked full with flaws. Regarding the plot, well, it’s essentially pretty poorly told. The story is full of rushed and vague plot points that are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review111311">
        never fully explained, let alone even made use of. It brings up seemingly important characters and scenes that never amount to anything in the end. Essentially, the writing for the story was pretty lazy and it left a lot to be desired and not in a good way.<br />
The show also gets way too caught up with its own fetishes. It’s not Highschool of the Dead bad, but it’s just up there. It breaks a lot of the tension and it’s quite uncomfortable watching whole scenes dedicated to them. I don’t want to see couples licking whips or girls licking syringe wounds alright?<br />
<br />
So even with that said, why did I fall in the minority? Why was I able to finish this show?<br />
<br />
Because everything about the show, aside from the plot, is so oddly enthralling. The atmosphere is ambiguous and mystifying. The delicately crisp animation, the beautiful dream-like artwork and use of monochromatic color palettes, the edgy cinematography and an absolutely gorgeous soundtrack drew me in. Every character intrigued me with their own quirky feats and Kiri and Iwai certainly made a very charming couple. Antagonists and side characters are well characterized and given enough depth to draw them away from merely being plot devices. The action scenes are also really well choreographed and they never last longer than they need to. The show is loaded with a lot of energy, a lot of charm and a lot of heart.<br />
<br />
From what I thought would only be mindless entertainment, it had much more substance than I thought and some truly beautiful moments.<br />
<br />
Do I recommend?: Crime Edge suffers from a very weak and underwhelming story and it tends to get too caught up with its fetishes. However, the show has enough charm and heart and it never has a dull moment. If you can tolerate a weak story and fetishes then Crime Edge is worth watching.

    I&#039;ll never know why I actually watched this show. I suppose it&#039;s because I didn&#039;t hear anything terrible about it, and it exceeded most people&#039;s expectations (granted, nobody had high expectations from this show to begin with). But after 10 episodes I can honestly say this is a very average series. <br />
<br />
The plot of this show is what makes it stand out from the rest: it&#039;s about people with weird fetishes fighting each other with special &quot;killing goods&quot; to save/kill a princess. I&#039;ll admit that doesn&#039;t sound all that bad, but sadly after 10 episodes it just didn&#039;t go anywhere. With each passing episode the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review102533">
        show got more and more boring, more and more stale, until I just forgot about it. If you are someone who isn&#039;t all that interested in the plot, do yourself a favor and save some time by watching something else. The plot doesn&#039;t get any better than what you see in the summary. <br />
<br />
The characters aren&#039;t very memorable. Aside from Iwai who is cute as hell, nobody else stands out at all. Kiri isn&#039;t very interesting, the two sisters have a decent backstory but aside from that fail to entertain, and nobody else gets much screen time. None of the villains so far are any good either (except maybe that blind girl we meet in episode 4, but she hasn&#039;t shown up in the last 6 episodes). <br />
<br />
The production values on this show are higher than I expected. It has very nice animation and a pretty decent soundtrack. I especially like the opening song. Sadly, this isn&#039;t enough to make up for the lackluster story and characters though. <br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong, this isn&#039;t a bad show or anything, I just wouldn&#039;t spend my time watching it. There are literally hundreds of shows that deserve your time more than this. If you have nothing, and I mean nothing else to watch, you won&#039;t hate this show, but you&#039;ll probably leave not all that happy with it either. <br />
<br />
Overall: 63/100

    Every few years there are anime that some believe revolutionizes the industry, some may even say that it &quot;saves&quot; anime. Case in point: Madoka (2011), Attack on Titan (2013), and Kill La Kill (2013). Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge however, is not one of those animes.<br />
<br />
Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge was the least entertaining anime of Spring 2013. I will give the originality of the story credit, sadly though originality alone is not enough to make this an even decent anime. The beginning three-fourths of the show walk the line between entertaining and complete boredom. Only after episode 8 do you finally realize that you&#039;re

          <span style="display: none;" id="review134765">
        completely tired of this show but your so invested in it that you can&#039;t help but watch it till the end. Besides for the execution of the story, the characters that are suppose to drive the story fail to connect emotionally on any basic level. The main hero of the show Kiri and his matching scissor that can cut anything bring nothing to the show but an example that even the weak can put up a fight when their love is in danger. When it comes to the Queen of hair her inability to protect herself plus her constant cries of Kiri Kun make you wish that writers will just get rid of her. It&#039;s rare that by the end of an anime I find myself wishing both the main characters would just die. The other minor characters, though far more interesting and less annoying then the two main characters, provide little to nothing to the story and after awhile become forgettable. The fight scenes, though animated decently, barely provide enough excitement to keep interest in the show. No matter how hard you try finding a good point about this show is almost impossible. If there was one good point about Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge is as previously stated is the concept of the show and the originality of the story. <br />
<br />
The tragedy that was Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge is enough to temporarily turn anyone away from shows in which a scissor is used as either a weapon or a plot driver. For those who haven&#039;t seen Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge but are thinking of watching it I sincerely recommend watching something else.

    This anime, at first i thought could be the new Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan). But sadly, it did&#039;nt live to those expectations. <br />
<br />
Dansai buri no Crime edge has a really unique story you won&#039;t necessarily see very commonly. Coming back from oxford, i&#039;d like to say that this anime deserves more than just a merit, it is unique but however can be considered REALLY weird as it is mainly about people with killing goods, and so the main male protagonist has to protect his loving cutesy girl Iwai from being killed by the cursed people with killing goods.<br />
<br />
Story 10: Mentioned above, being lazy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review121229">
        as i am today. <br />
IN A NUTSHELL VERSION= WEIRD BOY LIKES TO CUT HAIR OF LONG HAIR GIRL AND KILLS PEOPLE WITH SCISSORS/FETISH FOR HAIR CUTTING <br />
<br />
Art 9: The art is respectable and beautiful at times, but not to the wonderful or perhaps trash extent. <br />
<br />
Sound 5: One of its biggest issues, i&#039;ve never encountered any good music so far and this is a big problem. I would not like to hear the cutting of hair every episode as it makes me feel REALLY gay.<br />
<br />
Character 7: Main boy character, brave at times, Sadly weird fetish is weird.<br />
Iwai the girl with a curse of long growing hair is quite annoying and sexual at times, providing the viewers with a weird/ yet good feeling.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 7: Was weird at first, but then got better, leading to a overall of 8. Sadly, not really the new Attack on Titan. Planning to finish it by 10 years time. Lol~<br />
<br />

    Crime Wedgie (or Cry Moo Wedgie, if you prefer) is of passable quality, but it is definitely schizophrenic.  I had a difficult time watching it without having thoughts that distracted from the show:  thoughts that contained words like &quot;contrived&quot; and &quot;juvenile&quot;.  It just seems amateurish.  <br />
<br />
Some shows can mix multiple genres and come out okay.  This one doesn&#039;t.  The shifts from one thing to the next are so sudden they destroy any attempt at suspension of disbelief.  I would try to develop the idea that I liked the show.  That idea was repeatedly repulsed when the show

          <span style="display: none;" id="review108309">
        shifted.  For example, one minute the show may be trying a sweet, innocent teenage romance thing.  The next minute it is sexualizing bizarre things like scissors, hair, strangulation, and riding crops.  The breath fog only makes it seem more perverse.  <br />
<br />
For me, that was the biggest issue.  I may forgive amateur effort.  I may also forgive jarring genre shifts.  The feeling I got watching this thing was too much for me though.  I have watched my share of ecchi anime.  Some are pretty good.  Most are downright awful.  None make me feel so thoroughly unclean for having seen them.

    Drawn within It&#039;s context, Seems decent. Less appeal but better range than the manga.<br />
<br />
The Possible Setback contains darker tone and every details is a hit and miss<br />
<br />
Remaining Last 2 Episodes can be downer soon, As Why It&#039;s incomplete.<br />
<br />
Story Starts off :<br />
<br />
Haimura, as a natural geek barber from his own house, every time He cuts some hair. He became addicted with it (Nothing wrong with that, cause it&#039;s just a force habit). Precisely, He got involved into unknown house as He saw a girl in a white blouse towards the garden area. Their Fate ends up into a Deadly game where he should protect the Hair

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249093">
        Queen from getting Assassinated or Get Killed.<br />
<br />
Trauma/Syndrome : (Huge Point)<br />
<br />
Haimura, Release some obnoxius aura &quot;And once called The Angel Menace&quot;<br />
-Uncontrollable in the Depths of Fear<br />
-Some Hallucinations appears in his mind as he wields the weapon name &quot;Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge&quot;. <br />
-Possesses Rapid movements by suffering<br />
-Lastly, The Trust that He can&#039;t make a promised from the Queen whether he could deliberately cut the remaining hair while he gone berserk. <br />
<br />
Missed Plothole<br />
<br />
-It&#039;s the game, Why Not?<br />
<br />
-Set of Rules doesn&#039;t even do anything, More like a Born Killer just needs to step up his own goal.<br />
<br />
-Villains Are too plain, They don&#039;t even have a motive to regain their own wishes from their selfish desire, <br />
<br />
-The Ending, Think we already forget The True Goal of protecting within by her own side<br />
<br />
Overall So far it&#039;s still enjoyable and very underrated.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re into Survival Battle Death Royale Like this. Well this is for you<br />
