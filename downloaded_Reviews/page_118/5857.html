    “You are the ace I chose.” - Hina<br />
<br />
A world ruled by numbers, you gain and lose points for specific things you do. The concept starts out interesting and promising, but the execution of the idea is badly done.<br />
<br />
Story - 2/10<br />
When you have a bunch of ideas and want to create something full flavor but what you did is you pour everything in together without proper filtering or organization, Plunderer is a result of that. Compared to food, it looks like a product of someone who doesn’t know how to properly cook.<br />
<br />
Plunderer is messy and full of mysteries. Mysteries are getting revealed one by one throughout

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345598">
        the story. While some revelations make sense, but some are way too absurd. They are way too convenient to be a coincidence, making me think the world is too small, probably not a way to connect everything together. In addition, some mysteries are not being explained properly, they are more like a rough explanation in order to be able to say that the show is not totally illogical.<br />
<br />
The overall story is a serious theme but containing multiple weird and off-themed moments, such as cooking competition or drinking competition between characters who were just fighting each other to death.<br />
<br />
Animation - 5/10<br />
The animation quality is at the standard level but contains obvious flaws, which are stiff action scenes and intentional chibi-style art. In some scenes of Plunderer, the art turned characters into chibi-style, which I find not necessary, they resemble a lazy work.<br />
<br />
Sound - 7/10<br />
Standard theme songs and soundtracks. I am not a sound expert, so I would say that I find nothing outstanding and nothing bugged me.<br />
<br />
Characters - 3/10<br />
Plunder gave me a bad first impression. Licht Bach, a portrayal of a true pervert, who wanted to see Hina’s underwear at the first met, which she was a total stranger to Licht at that time. Normal ecchi is fine, but sexual harassment is not something to impress audiences with.<br />
<br />
As mentioned in the story section, mysteries are getting revealed one by one throughout the story but having too much coincidence. Those mysteries involve characters and their relationships, which are mostly not convincing in a level that reading spoilers from Fandom does not ruin your enjoyment, but instead become more interesting.<br />
<br />
After all, the characters of Plunderer are only tools to make the story proceed. The writing does not make characters important at all. Characters may have a background and unique personality, but their personality has no effect or has nothing to do with the story, which makes them easily replaceable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 3/10<br />
The only thing that was able to keep me watching this show is the concept, which nevertheless did not get a proper explanation. I only wanted to see which direction would this mess go.<br />
<br />
Recommendations<br />
I do not recommend this to any people who are familiar with anime. If you are still new to anime, Plunder is something you may be able to enjoy.

    The whole concept of numbers deciding your time up land is both fascinating and the type of thing you&#039;re glad doesn&#039;t exist in real life. I think the number thing really fits the story, even if the series seems to have some stuff they really need to clear up. A big problem with Plunderer is its direction. The plot twists become pretty confusing and at the point where I am I have no idea what is what anymore. The plot seems to kind of go too quickly, and its not even that amazing either. Even if the number part is sort of unique to it,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review329572">
        later making the abyss not a scary thing pissed me off. A big part of the original glamour was its scary factor. If you take that away from it the series just seems dull.<br />
<br />
The point where an enemy is introduced is kind of late-ish, and dissapointed me in many ways. The more the manga advances the more confusing it becomes apparently. A supernatural feature made me hope for something bigger but we only got a helicopter instead, like why. I could just go on about the list of dissapointing factors in the plot.<br />
<br />
What I like about the plot is its characters. Many of them are likable, even the evil guys. The development is currently quite smooth as well. The only problem here may be how original these characters actually are; Hina for example is pretty generic.<br />
<br />
Plunderer needs more relaxing and bonding time instead of throwing the characters constantly into new scenerios. It also needs to clear up on whose an enemy and whose not, though only time will reveal that one. Hina is a different case but the other characters don&#039;t get enough time to develop since its all protagonist time.<br />
<br />

    Writer James Beckett of AnimeNewsNetwork once said, speaking on the anime “Fire Force”, that it felt like it was written by “two middle-schoolers stacked on top of each other wearing a thick trench coat.” Sorry if I didn’t get that exactly right, James. Can I say the same applies to “Plunderer”? Well, as someone who was once a middle schooler thumping my feet to Slipknot and Green Day as I scrawled in the margins of my homework, I’d like to think my capacity to conjure a competent narrative was at least marginally better than whatever...the fuck I just saw. <br />
<br />
I’m going to keep this review

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345504">
        of Plunderer as brief as possible because I’d rather it vacate the mental real-estate it has occupied in my head-space now that it has finished airing. You think of anime like “One Punch Man” and “Attack on Titan” where absolutely every aspect of production had to fall perfectly into place in order for the celluloid to properly translate to screen, in other words, lightning in a bottle. Plunderer is like the inverse of that, imagine, if you would, a 2-liter bottle of shit filled to its absolute brim over the course of 24 weeks until...well...you get the idea. Plunderer is the type of legendarily bad anime that you only get once in a decade because anything that can go wrong with an anime during its syndication absolutely did go wrong. <br />
<br />
Plunderer is juvenile, it seems to be under the impression that a good story is predicated on otherworldly plot-twists, tragic heroes, and romance, but that’s just not the case. At the core of Plunderer’s story is a horribly unlikeable protagonist, Licht Bach. Licht checks just about every box for how not to write a compelling protagonist. He sexually assaults any woman in sight, has a happy-go-lucky attitude about it, and hides behind a shield of tragedy to force some degree of emotion out of the audience. <br />
<br />
I’m an unrepentantly perverse and salacious bastard, the furthest thing from a prude, but even I have to draw the line somewhere. For a character like Licht Bach to have as many love interests as your run of the mill harem protagonist is nothing short of insulting. The number of women queued up to swing their legs open for this dude is staggering, it gets to a point where they are actively embracing being sexually assaulted just to have this man’s dick. I don’t normally allow my convictions to bleed into anime, because applying real-world logic to a cartoon can have varying results. But in Plunderer’s case, I just can’t ignore how these female characters are presented, because it’s nothing short of reductive and dangerously exaggerated. <br />
<br />
Is the story at least good enough to distract from the chaos of its forced character relations? Well...no, not really. Trying to explain the story of Plunderer would be like asking Charlie Day to expound on the modalities of working in a mail-room. It’s mired in minutiae and messy plotting, so for the sake of it, I’ll highlight some of the essential bullet-points. Licht Bach is some kind of super-soldier from the past that was forced to kowtow to his superiors to spare his peers, he bastardized his ideals when he was forced to kill others even though he was in a fucking military academy, and now in the present when the world is virtually unrecognizable he’s seen as a pariah known as the “Legendary Ace”, also there are aliens involved? <br />
<br />
One of my absolute favorite scenes in Plunderer is when the main cast is forced to visit the past and during the school’s opening ceremony, the Commander straight up pops 3 punks in the crowd. It was jaw-dropping, to say the least, but it’s not until after the back and forth with Licht does he reveal that he actually shot them with a paint gun...even though they acted like they were dead the entire time. Like “Oh yeah, golly, I’m not dead!” Seriously, I checked out from this anime when I saw an attack-helicopter slowly rise from the smoke of the abyss. <br />
<br />
The music is terribly anachronistic, mundane, and poorly integrated from scene to scene due to poor directing. The animation doesn’t even have to be spoken for in this case, but for the sake of it, I’ll say that Plunderer is so poorly animated that you can count the number of smear-frames per episode on your fingers. The coloring and linework is incredibly flat to the point where this show looks and feels like it was released over a decade ago. <br />
<br />
Plunderer is…awful, irredeemably so. But it was never boring, far from it. With a bit of grandad’s cough medicine coursing through my system, it was actually raucous fun. Can I recommend it? Well honestly, that’s for you to decide whether or not I want the rest of you curious viewers at large to...share in my pain. <br />

    I was glad to see that the manga I enjoyed was getting an anime adaptation. I was kinda worried it would be mediocre, or maybe it would be just a small 12 episode &quot;prologue&quot; arc or something, but I didn&#039;t expect it to be THAT terrible. It really takes some skill to turn a pretty solid manga into this abomination. So here is the list of problems:<br />
1. Visuals. Here it feels exactly as it did with the latest season of Seven Deadly Sins: face animation and emotions are almost non-existant, all cool fights with great moves are a static image + some blinking &quot;special effects&quot;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345466">
        (and don&#039;t forget screaming AAAAAA for the whole fight). I swear, I have seen gifs with better animation, and to add insult to injury - even manga had better drawn static panels and frames for that exact fights. Why didn&#039;t you just colorise it if you didn&#039;t want to bother with actual animation? I have no idea. And outside of fights all charachers either barely move or it is animated &quot;on budget&quot; by two-three students who just did a part time job to get some food. It is trully terrible.<br />
2. Sound. There are only 2 types of sound here: so dull you forget it at once and so irritating it makes your ears bleed. First category consists of openings and endings, second - of all the bgm. Military theme was so bad that I nearly skipped all the scenes where it was playing. If visuals were drawn by students, the sound was more likely made by a hobo for a bottle of cheap wine. I think even if you took a cat and pulled its tail - it would still be a better &quot;music&quot;.<br />
3. Pacing/story. Boy oh boy, THIS is the problem. The real one. While I have some degree of tolerance to bad looks/sounds, pacing just kills the source completely. Imagine a perfectly normal source, with nice fights, good plot turns and some ecchi jokes. Now take all the ecchi jokes, that take a panel or a page at most (with chapter being about 50) and stretch it to be 5 minutes long in a 20-minute episode. And now tell me, how can any joke keep up if you make it from a 2% time gag to a 25%? The answer is: you should not even try to do it, as this joke will become way too annoying and way too pushy and it simply will not be funny. And it is EXACTLY what they have done. All jokes - stretched, like they wanted to make it a full-time hentai but chickend out after prelude, all worldbuilding - infodumped in a few seconds, all battles consist out of 2-3 &quot;moves&quot;, as heroes just repeat some 2-frame animation. Also there are a lot of lost moments, that may not feel like anything but a filler, but later it actually adds some lost elements to puzzle, as some characters did stuff that is really hard to justify without those small elements.<br />
I think I didn&#039;t mention a number of smaller issues, but to be honest after mentioned 3 big problems I have already critisized 90% of the anime, at this point any more criticism will be just beating a corpse.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: this anime is a horrible adaptation. The only reason I didn&#039;t give it the worst score is as a token of appreciation to the source material, wich is good, but this whoole anime is a waste of time, efford (although not much of it) and potential.<br />

    This show is about a guy that likes to roam around<br />
He&#039;s never in one place, he roam from town to town<br />
And when he find himself falling for some girl<br />
He turns into a massive creep and start molesting her<br />
Cause he&#039;s a plunderer, yeah a plunderer!<br />
<br />
This show was a train-wreck from beginning to end. It started of as a typical generic ecchi show but went on to pretentiously try and disguise itself as more than just a self-insert power fantasy. It expects you to feel invested in the dramatic moments but because it&#039;s so amateurishly executed it becomes laughable. I think that if anything this is where

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345480">
        the enjoyment of this show lies. Characters doing bizarre actions or random plot-conveniences are not rare in this show which made for some entertainment gold. But it doesn&#039;t do enough to make up for how poor everything else is.<br />
<br />
Plot holes are pretty frequent and a lot of things are left unexplained, some of which were in the manga but not here for some in-explainable reason. The world-building especially was very lacking even though it&#039;s focused on a lot. For example in the world of Alcia, everything is ruled by a number/count. The count goes up or down depending on if you succeed or fail a certain task, the higher your count the more powerful you are. Can this task be changed? Are there rules of what you can/can&#039;t have as a task? Is it balanced or are some tasks just easier than others? It&#039;s a very interesting concept that sadly lack depth and only exist to tell how strong a person is. Instead of focusing on interesting things like this they focus everything on the shitstain that is our protagonist Licht.<br />
<br />
Pretty much everything centers around him while leaving no room to expand on the rest of the characters. Leading to a boring cast of shallow individuals that&#039;s hard to care about. Most women are there to be sexualized and/or fall in love with his &quot;irresistible&quot; personality and looks. Especially Hina and Lyne, two blockheads that have no will of their own besides Licht&#039;s safety and having his children. They had some ambitions in life before meeting Licht, but realized that he is much more important than them. Jail was the only decent character since he at least changed into a man that starts to value people over his duty. It wasn&#039;t mind blowing development, but it was something. <br />
<br />
Licht himself is the least likable out of them all. He pervs on girls in the open who clearly dislikes it and he never suffer any severe consequences for it. He even molest the daughter of his dead childhood friend. It leaves the impression of an egoistic asshole who doesn&#039;t give a damn about others. But he is also shown to have a kind side which clashes with his extremely perverted nature. Leading to his morals being very confusing and made me anything but invested in him.<br />
<br />
But was there some visual pleasantries at least? No there&#039;s no saving grace here either. The artwork is bland with undetailed backgrounds and unimaginative lighting. Character movement is often stiff and disproportioned which leaves a lot to be desired during the lackluster fight scenes. Of higher value than I expected coming from such a new studio but was as a whole below average. <br />
<br />
Good soundtrack and voice acting? Not really. The music is forgettable and falls on deaf ears due to how little weight it&#039;s contribution have. The voice acting was also far from extraordinary. I can&#039;t blame the actors for it because of the awful script they had to work with. It&#039;s a shame because there were some talented actors in this, but it at least made for some stupid over the top dialogue.<br />
<br />
So would I recommend Plunderer? While it had some entertainingly bad moments and twist that spiced things up, it&#039;s not enough to be worth your time in my eyes. But if you&#039;ve finished it and enjoyed it for the same reason I did then I can recommend Ousama Game for a similar experience.

    I&#039;m not really sure what to say about Plunderer. While it&#039;s premise surely is very different, and the ecchi themes aren&#039;t over the top that make you turn away, and the art style is well detailed and colourful. But it&#039;s slow pacing at the start can really be a bit of a turn off early doors, but I will say the latest episodes have been smash hits.<br />
<br />
We&#039;re introduced into a collect bunch of characters over time. From a traveling sweet girl who wants to fulfill her mother&#039;s dying wishes. To a confident bar owner, to the wacky and weird legendary ace himself. Fair to say

          <span style="display: none;" id="review329465">
        they have a great mesh of entertaining characters for sure.<br />
<br />
Like I stated earlier, the art style for this show really is colourful. Where it be the characters outfits themselves. Or certain parts of the show, like backgrounds, powers, and all sorts. Really nicely done. While the sound fits the scenes as per normal.<br />
<br />
The story is what really made me want to watch this show. As the idea of numbers that determine your fate is a really interesting concept. Proven more so within the show. With how sometimes these numbers can increase. Makes you wonder how other counts go up.<br />
<br />
All in all, Plunderer has a bit of a slow start, but it gets better as it goes along. A neat anime that I&#039;m gonna continue watching, and you should give it a go too!

    Have you ever heard of the concept of Outsider Art? It’s art created by self-taught or naive art makers who are not familiar with the established art culture, including art by the straight-up mentally ill, which leads to their creations being strange or different in ways you wouldn’t normally see.<br />
This is what Plunderer feels like. While technically it’s a battle shounen with some comedy and ecchi elements, its real substance is a rolling snowball of plot twists that happen every five minutes and are about as intelligent as wearing pants on your head. You can’t see those plot twists coming by virtue of them being

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345474">
        idiotic, you can’t predict how the characters will develop because their development is insane and you’re not sure what the story is trying to tell you because it has like three speech impediments at once.<br />
Make no mistake though, that does not mean at all that this show is “lol random” or “so bad, it’s good.” “So bad, it’s good” is a garbage concept in the first place. If something truly fails on artistic or technical level, then, no, you can’t enjoy it “ironically.” “Bad show” and “unenjoyable show” are literally the same exact thing, so either it is good or you are larping being ironic. Anyway, plenty of people will tell you that Plunderer is an objectively bad series. I can guarantee you that those same people would think that their favorite generic entry-level shounen or “mature and deep” drama rated 8.50+ on MAL aren’t unwatchable trash - and they’ll be wrong in both cases. Plunderer isn’t a good show, it’s not a smart show, I’d even call it an impaired show, but it’s not impaired mentally. It’s plot is bullshit, but it IS a plot, it checks all the proper storytelling checkboxes. The storyline is cohesive and was clearly planned ahead, with the writer knowing what he is writing and why. The earlier set pieces properly foreshadow later revelations. The later set pieces build upon the previously established concepts. The characters’ development is a legit development - growth they undergo as the result of experiences they lived through. Even the bizarre fanservice eventually has a narrative purpose (to make you feel bad, Emergence-style). The gun that hangs on the wall in the first act might be purple and shaped like a dildo - but it still fires in the third act like it’s supposed to.<br />
<br />
To reiterate, this is a show that rescues itself from mediocrity by being unique (obnoxious) enough to notice it. It’s pros are a solid mystery element, decent character designs, and unique ecchi comedy of varying cringe-worthiness. It’s cons are below-average production values and a slow start with the first ~8 episodes that probably should have been 4 episodes instead.<br />
<br />
8/10 for “At least it tries.”<br />

    I like this anime. At first it was hard slow to begin with but I really liked how it was paced and I felt that people should give this a chance. Yes there is some ecchi and the main girl kind of seems a little wuss but I think shes cute and this anime was a great watch to pass the time. <br />
<br />
<br />
The premise starts off where people have numbers on their body. The higher the number the higher you are ranked in societal standards. There was alot of unexpected things I saw in this anime. I dont know if its because I haven&#039;t watched

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332305">
        anime in a really long time, but I didn&#039;t thing its as bad as everyone makes it out to be. The music is pretty decent and the art is pretty good as well.<br />

    Right now, Plunderer seems to be suffering from its own design—and it’s doing itself no favours in how it decided to do a “pre-release” covering parts of the story, the ‘early story’, which is both ‘the most Mysterious’ and (though intentionally) but, unfortunately, is part of a construction extremely ‘well thought-out’ to such a degree where, be it the first few episodes or the following finale of this first cour, the speed in which the World of Plunderer “falls into place” is so extraordinarily ‘methodical’ to its ‘desired narrative’ that it’s very easy to get the impression that it doesn’t know what it’s doing...<br />
<br />
Trust me

          <span style="display: none;" id="review329571">
        though: as someone who’s read the manga, if the show continues at the same quality of animation whilst continuing to be extremely faithful to the source material, ... we are really in for a treat. Plunderer shines entirely-because of how intense its Mystery, Pseudo-Romcom Drama, Seinen-like Action, and World-Building are - and I listed ‘Mystery’ first for a reason. It’s hard to call Plunderer a ‘Thriller’ - mostly due to how a Thriller combines a tonne of varying narratives ‘that are clearly understood only to the viewer (aka “beyond the 4th wall”) to converge on a single point - as Plunderer does the opposite wherein, whilst there’s many varying narratives that you can clearly grasp ‘are converging on a single point’, it’s ‘the cast of characters and the world they inhabit’ that understand what’s going on (and not “you”)—but, due to how extraordinary the vast-world of charming and unique characters - with their own motives that all feel like a complicated product of the World-Building of ‘Plunderer’ - are slowly &amp; methodically [I used that phrase earlier for a reason] etched out to the viewer, it’s also hard to call it a Mystery. Honestly: it’s a bit of both for varying reasons. <br />
<br />
Stick with Plunderer. The first few episodes are a ruse in many ways. They act all silly, and the hints they drop (towards ’a grand mystery’ that, supposedly, they entail) easily have us fooled as “nothing more than a false promise or just a coincidence or accident in the Writing” due to the nature of Plunderer’s core elements—but don’t be mistaken or fooled. Every single aspect of this story/show is an act of subversion for the sake of heightening its Mystery, and for the sake of veiling just how “forsaken” the world of Plunderer is.<br />
<br />
Stick with it. Once you get a taste for the ’true blend’ of Action and Mystery that Plunderer expands into [and rather soon, too], you’ll be happy that you didn’t pay attention to all of these ”misguided” ratings and reviews.<br />
<br />
Enjoy. 9/10 - but easily a 10/10 if the source material and production quality continues to follow faithfully as it has for the 6 episodes I’ve watched. [Will leave it at ‘9/10’ till the Real Deal kicks off~]<br />
<br />
(PS: dub is amazing! 2 main MCs are incredible, and all other casts have been exactly how I thought they’d sound from source material. Dub is absolutely viable! Just sayin’ la~)

    I really enjoyed watching this show! I literally sat up all night binge watching it until i was completely caught up. I think this show is really good, and similar to The Seven Deadly Sins, it had a &quot;village expedition&quot;  kinda theme, and the plot was amazing.<br />
The art gave a modern yet still &quot;Old time village&quot; theme, and the dubbing was okay. Some of the characters sounded a bit funny in the english dubbing, but I think that the Japanese dubbing was a bit better ( My opinion! If you wanna give it a try, go ahead, and see what you think!) All the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330429">
        characters showed their own personalities, and each had their own kind of look, with completely different outfits that still completed the &quot;Villager&quot; kinda look.Overall, I really enjoyed this anime, and in my opinion, will keep you interested until the end, and most likely even rewatchable.

    i never write Preliminary reviews but for this i felt i had to because there is something about this show that seems to show great potential. I got the feeling akin to fairy tail where there is a great back story to the fantasy world that has yet to be uncovered. The number and its significance and the mystery surrounding the main characters actually has me wishing i didnt watch the episodes as they came out because as soon as one ends you would want to see the next. <br />
I really hope it stays on track to be what potential i think this can have

     Minor spoilers. my first Review. <br />
<br />
Story: i don&#039;t get the numbers thing at all. first thing i learn is that if your number goes to 0, you get dragged to the abyss. then i learn the MC has -999 but he does not get sent to the abyss because he has a ballot.<br />
(if u have a ballot with numbers it saves u). <br />
But the mom at the start still got sent to the abyss even though she still had a ballot on her. why not keep it and find the hero with your daughter together????<br />
<br />
One thing i rly hate in shows is when they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331294">
        introduce a character just to kill them off (especially if it happens in the same episode)<br />
<br />
<br />
The world: i dont get the world in this anime. we are in medieval looking times, yet small headsets with microphones exist. also a magasin with a visible scanner code on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
characters: <br />
Hina is clearly from another planet, she does not even know her own world.<br />
her story arc is already finished somewhat, she found the hero in the first episode and already wants to have his babies. guess she can get stronger maybe?<br />
<br />
MC is your average op white knight that is also a perv and hides his real power for some reason that i dont care about<br />
<br />
Every evil guy can be identified if he has a hidden sticker somewhere<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: it looks average at best, most of the time it looks rough, unnatural and unpolished. the background is boring in every shot.<br />
<br />
Plz just draw another city, i swear i have seen this city layout +10 now. atleast this one does not have a wall or river (guess i can give it a point for that)<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: average<br />
<br />
<br />

    Plunderer - such an underestimated anime.<br />
<br />
I’m up to date with this anime watching every week and it’s been a journey I can say!<br />
<br />
I believe this anime shows good premise. An intriguing  story line- comedy , adventure a little titillation and relatable human emotions. <br />
<br />
<br />
I won’t go into the normal review about what’s happened or ruin the view factor for those watching it - but the story is completely different to any other anime I have watched . <br />
Ive never seen an anime based on a ballot system which defines your life total  .<br />
<br />
I’ve been on tenterhooks when episodes have left me asking questions

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340828">
        about certain events and character interactions. As this episode finished I was satisfied finally have answers to questions that have bugged me for weeks and yes I could have wikis but what would that do??!<br />
<br />
I think people should be more fair on this anime and give it a fair chance . It’s got great art and storyline and deserves a look .  <br />
<br />
FYI licht is amazing - totally amazing:)

    To be honest with you, I thought that Plunderer was really bad. That was mainly because of the super generic characters and the very basic looking world design.<br />
<br />
Story 5/10:<br />
To be fair, Plunderer has quite a unique premise, which is btw. the only reason why I kept watching it at the time. To put it shortly, everything is ruled by numbers, the higher your count is the stronger you are. A little bit later into the series, there is quite an interesting plot twist which made the show much more enjoyable in my opinion. For spoiler reasons I won&#039;t say what happened.<br />
<br />
Art 7/10:<br />
Plunderer&#039;s art style is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337726">
        pretty standart, but not bad in any way. The animations are smooth and the linework is pretty good aswell. The only minor issue i had was the bad CGI, but it only is a minor issue because it only appears very shortly in only a handfull of episodes.<br />
<br />
Sound 7/10:<br />
Just as the Art, the soundeffects in this show are decent but far from great. The background music also isn&#039;t very noticable but still not bad, it just isn&#039;t any banger that you would listen too in your freetime.<br />
<br />
Characters 4/10:<br />
Honestly the biggest issue that I have with plunderer is that it&#039;s characters do have some character traits, but these just get really annoying after a short period of time. For example the protagonist Licht or often refered to as &quot;Pudding&quot; is a big pervert that likes himself some booty, but the show is just overdoing this and almost every other trait shown throughout the series, which makes most of the characters really annoying.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 6/10:<br />
I really had to force myself to continue watching this, but the main plot twist really got me interested in terms of how the story would play out or how certain characters would develop after the twist. This show really needs like 10 episodes to get going, but it really hooked me afterwards.<br />
<br />
Overall 6/10:<br />
If you don&#039;t have a high minimum estimated quality bar, you surely will find some sort of enjoyment in Plunderer. It certainly is not a good show but still worth watching, especially after said plot twist kicks in and flips everything upside down. Plunderer just really is a total mess at the beginning but slowly unfolds into a more complex story while the characters turn from annoying twat&#039;s into quite loveable people.<br />

    I&#039;ll be blunt, this anime sucks. Honestly my rating would be a 1, if not for the fact that the manga is the complete opposite. I&#039;m not one for Ecchi, but I&#039;m not bothered by it. Still, there was simply too much of it. Honestly the anime prioritizes the Ecchi over the very essential Plot of this series and I absolutely hated it.<br />
<br />
I stumbled upon this anime by chance, when I was suggested a scene of Episode 9 where Licht was revealed to be the Ace of Flashing Strikes. I was interested despite the plain animations, because hey, not every anime studio has sufficient budget.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331720">
        So I took the liberty to binge watch the series up to the latest episode, episode 10. And yes, there was so much filler it was almost painful to watch. What kept me going was my curiosity of this universe, which episode 9 had shown the tip of the iceberg of. <br />
<br />
So, episode 10. I was curious, and went ahead to read the manga. Oh boy, how my impression of Plunderer skyrocketed. Other than its beautiful art, this manga really took me by its world building. There was minimal Ecchi, just a couple panels here and there with some sneaking in, which is the optimal amount and what the anime should have been. Anyway, I started reading where episode 10 dropped off, so i didn&#039;t read the first dozen chapters, but I can tell you that I couldn&#039;t stop reading the moment I started. Licht&#039;s past was so tragic and beautifully executed, I cried my eyes out. The poor children, I wish them to be spared (from the author lol) and lead a happy life without regrets... <br />
<br />
Anyway, the manga is still ongoing, and I&#039;ll definitely support it. The anime... Let&#039;s see if the studio can redeem themselves with our dear MC&#039;s arc. Otherwise... Nope. <br />
<br />
In conclusion, read the manga. Just... Read the Manga. Treat the anime as a side item. Only then can you truly enjoy what this tragic series has to offer.

    Y&#039;know, sometimes when I watch shows of any kind, especially for ecchi anime, I&#039;d like to just turn off my brain and just enjoy the show for what it is and bask in the fanservice that&#039;s as ever funny as it can be, being memorable the best experience bar none. But Plunderer? Kinda the same-ish ecchi, but missing all the charm for absolute genericness instead.<br />
<br />
This show, based on the manga of the same name by mangaka Suu Minasuki (who also brought us the memorable and definitely lovable Sora no Otoshimono), is the continuation of the mangaka&#039;s effort to incorporate his trademark ecchi scenes that&#039;s branched

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345455">
        out to another story, this time being a &quot;creative mature fantasy&quot; about &quot;Counts&quot;, &quot;the Abyss&quot;, and the &quot;Legendary Aces&quot;. NGL (and I really preface here, the manga&#039;s leaps better than this horrendous adaptation, just so you know).<br />
<br />
The story in a nutshell: In a world, where everyone has a &quot;Count&quot; (based on the things related to important aspect of their loves), and this number can increase or decrease if not fulfilled, no big deal. But what it is lethal, is when that Count drops to 0, they get dragged into &quot;the Abyss&quot;, and GLWL (Good Life Well-Lived - equals death). A girl&#039;s mom holding some kind of sphere, passes her that sphere and tells her to go and find a &quot;Legendary Ace&quot; (those with white stars next to their Count) for wish fulfillment purposes. Seems straightforward enough, until the plot takes a turn in the 2nd half (which if you dropped before Episode 12, consider it spoiler territory).<br />
<br />
From a manga reader&#039;s standpoint, this is longer than Suu Minazuki&#039;s attempts to capture a fantasy story within the grasp of his improved writing, and that&#039;s why the manga is praised to high regard (though lesser than Sora no Otoshimono for obvious reasons). Where the anime adaptation failed is in its slow pacing at trying to adapt a complete 1-to-1 with the manga (FYI, each chapter is 40~50-ish pages long). I understand and admit that it&#039;s hard to grasp 2 chapters per episode, but it&#039;ll be better if the pacing took up quite a bit to make up for the enjoyment factor.<br />
<br />
The characters are truly a big part of Plunderer&#039;s storytelling, and they&#039;re cliché, but good characters for the most part. Hina is the main female character whose journey started out horrid, but the determination never falters through, even believing that the main male character can prevail almost every trouble, past or present. And that main male character is the Legendary Ace Licht Bach, with a white star on his Count. The seemingly ecchi and pervertic behaviour of this kinda reminds me of Sora no Otoshimono&#039;s Tomoki (though similar but different), but his true purpose bearing the cost of lives in his hands is the mitigating factor to his survival. The time in the past shaped his future bearing through war and back again, solidifying his perseverance and goal, despite pushing Hina away for the most part due to his unrelenting kindness.<br />
<br />
The other wayward characters: Sergeant Pele, Major Sergeant &quot;short-skirted&quot; Lynn, and First Lieutenant Jail Murdoch, all part of the royal guards that governs people and upkeeps the peace within the magic-infested world that is Alcia. Along with another Legendary Ace Nana, I have to admit that they&#039;re unessential to the plot at the very beginning, but looking past the 2nd half is when their involvement is a crucial factor to bridging the past with the present, and that is the job of the Alcia &quot;ministers&quot; to uphold the spheres of power, called Original Ballots to keep the city afloat. One of these, and it&#039;s more than enough to grant massive power to one who acquires it (and that&#039;s what Hina had at the start). So, if you&#039;re looking forward to more intense tension, you&#039;ve gotta sit through the 1st half to find out (and that&#039;s all for spoilers).<br />
<br />
NGL, the animation and visuals are downright subpar and horrid, none of what makes Suu Minazuki&#039;s artstyle of magic stands out in the manga. If you&#039;ve haven&#039;t been paying attention to the studio responsible for this, GEEKTOYS is a brand new studio founded in 2017, and this is the studio&#039;s 3rd production work (behind RErideD and Hensuki). Being the studio&#039;s first work in a relentless 24-episode schedule, I must say that the visuals are massively disappointing with shoddy artwork and that insanely low garbage-tier animation (especially during action fights, crikey). Not that I was expecting anything to be good anyways, and with each passing episode, always dreading with dear inside that this will be all over.<br />
<br />
On the music front, most of what is here isn&#039;t reminiscent of Sora no Otoshimono, but even for the most enthusiastic of music listeners, this was a case of love-hate relationship for me. The 1st set of OP and ED were frankly the best, at least that much for Miko Itou&#039;s repertoire. The 2nd set was lackluster to say the least. Nothing else much to say here.<br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;d prefer if you&#039;re anticipating to watch this show, read the manga instead to understand in the ins and outs of how this show is developed in the rightest ways possible. As far as from an anime-only overview, it just is plain bad.

    This review contains no spoiler<br />
<br />
Having seen both side of the spectrum, I can safely say that Plunderer is a bad good anime that you can watch in your free time. And by that I mean Plunderer is a good anime with some very bad qualities that drag the whole show down.<br />
<br />
I understand the low rating and every complain people have with the anime and wholeheartedly respect every opinions (at least all the sane opinions). That doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m agree with them but I understand why people don&#039;t like the anime. All the (sane) opinions to me is always valid.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
If you are a very unpatient viewer

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333103">
        and can&#039;t handle some prologue, I think this anime is not for you. But to every person that feels like this anime don&#039;t even bother to tell a story after 10 episodes, I must say that you&#039;re only a fifth into the manga and it barely scratch the surface. The real story is yet to be told and now that we are done with the prologue (I assume you&#039;ve already made it through ep 7), some plot elements are gonna kick in. The author does have a story to tell and you are about to see it if you haven&#039;t dropped it already.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Regarding some problems people have with the characters, I have no reasons to blame them since they are just not familiar with Minazuki Suu&#039;s writing style. He tends to introduce very generic, trope-ish and one-note characters to throw us off but later on developes them to become more interesting and likeable. Minazuki doesn&#039;t write assholes, he writes characters that have a backstories which shaped them into the kind of person they are today and I really like that. The dynamics among the characters are enjoyable or even hilarious at times. <br />
<br />
Comedy: <br />
<br />
Comedy is as subjective as it gets so no arguments about that. All I can say is the comedy is not overused and never gets into the way of the plot. No comedies nor ecchi are to be found in serious moments (yes this manga have serious moments, and many). Minazuki only shove in the fanservice at the end of an arc or when the problems are already resolved. Hell, some characters even used them as a coping mechanism when they have to confront with their past trauma. All in all. I think it&#039;s well done. <br />
(Plus, if you enjoy the comedy of this show, you are still a perfectly normal human being and nothing is wrong with you. You have the right to enjoy anything you like)<br />
<br />
Music and Art:<br />
<br />
I put these two together because I don&#039;t have much to say. The music is fine, I don&#039;t have any major problems with it, the ED was cute, I liked it, the rest are just meh. The art is fine coming from an inexperienced studio like GEEKTOYS but only when the characters don&#039;t move. The sakuga is atrocious and makes me want to vomit while bleeding from my eyes (I watched Kimetsu the night before). It is just soooooo bad. I think that&#039;s the main reason why some people didn&#039;t even make it through the first half. I really hope GEEKTOYS will improve in a very near future.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s it for the review, there are so much more I want to address but this is getting very long and I don&#039;t want to waste your precious time so I&#039;m gonna end it here. If you are interested in my opinion and want to hear more you can find me on the official Plunderer discord, my username is &quot;diepiepew&quot;.<br />
<br />
Oh wait almost forgot the ratings, I usually don&#039;t want to rate things but if you desperately want it, here you go:<br />
Story: 9<br />
Art: 4<br />
Sound: 6 <br />
Character: 9<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
Overall: 8<br />
<br />

    Plunderer is a show that’s not for everyone. The first half of the show features a tremendous amount of fan service and If you don’t enjoy those types of things, this will be a very hard watch for you. However, if like me, you don’t mind such tropes you will be treated to one of the most under appreciated and interesting stories of the year.<br />
<br />
Plunderer takes place in a world where everyone has a “count” which can go up or down depending on your actions in life. Once you hit 0, you will be sent to the abyss. A mysterious world from which nothing has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345462">
        ever returned. <br />
<br />
The concept of the count was very interesting to me and the dynamic of the world managed to keep me engaged consistently. On a weekly basis, this was always the show I looked forward to the most simply because I found the mysteries of the show and the characters to be great. The story takes a while to get going, so if you’re someone who likes instant return on investment, you won’t find that here. But, I can promise you that if you stick around, the second half of the show has some fantastic storytelling and development.<br />
<br />
For many people, having to wait for a show to “get good” would be a reason to rate it lowly or drop it. For me, I think those lighthearted/fluff moments you get at the beginning of a show take on more weight once a twist or major tonal shift occurs. They allow you to form a connection with characters and emphasise with them during emotional sequences. To that end, I believe the fan-service and light hearted moments during the first part of the show were actually very important to the overall story and added to my enjoyment. <br />
<br />
The one are where I feel Plunderer was weak, was animation. The art is really bright and character models are solid. But, during fight scenes, I just didn’t ever notice a real “umph” factor and motion felt bland. For a series with a lot of fights, I would have liked to have seen a little more in that department, but it didn’t hamper my enjoyment too much.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, Plunderer is a show that will reward you for sticking with it. It features likeable characters and a genuinely interesting story and world. It was a very enjoyable watch for me that got me reading the manga, and remains one of my favourite anime of the year. Plunderer gets 8 counts out of 10 from me.<br />

    This is Winter 2020&#039;s Arifureta &amp; Assassin&#039;s Pride. A show that looks somewhat decent at first, only to question yourself for reasons to even continue watching episodes later. [Overall Grade: 4]<br />
<br />
This anime feels like something from the late 2000s-early 2010s era of anime—a power fantasy harem OP protagonist. You know, the classic and overused &quot;protagonist hiding his real power until the very last moment to look cool&quot;. With Licht holding the damsel in distress Hina and finally revealing he is the legendary &quot;Ace&quot;, corny is the word I&#039;ll describe the ending of the first episode.<br />
Seven episodes in and I still have no idea where the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review335370">
        story is going or who the main villain is. I couldn&#039;t even remember if there was a villain aside from Jail. The government maybe? I don&#039;t know. Episodes feel like they should be important to the plot but feel like filler instead. I dropped this show when I felt like it had nothing else to offer anymore. Taking a peek at what the show is right now, I was right.<br />
The Count system is what made me most interested to watch this anime in the first place. It&#039;s a really intriguing concept—you raise your count by repeatedly doing something decided at birth. It also serves as your societal rank—you can&#039;t disobey an order from a higher Count. Once your count reaches zero, you&#039;re transported to hell? And lastly, it serves as your power level in combat? It didn&#039;t touch more on it which is a shame. There&#039;s so much potential on what it could have expanded on with this premise. Instead, all we get is this garbage filler nonsense. [Story: 4]<br />
<br />
Licht is your typical annoying power fantasy MC—carefree most of the time and doesn&#039;t take fights seriously until he has to BS his way out of it. He acts the opposite of what he looks like if that makes any sense. Even his supposed secret &quot;Ace&quot; background doesn&#039;t seem all that interesting. Although his perverseness leads to fan service, there&#039;s not much else to this character. Jail is the only likable character in this anime. His character just screams both antagonist and protagonist at the same time. But aside from that, the rest are garbage. Nana is just there to showcase some boobs, and to give cryptic hints on the &quot;mysterious&quot; background of Licht. Hina and Lynn are just the same character but with different looks. They both serve two purposes: 1) to be in Licht&#039;s harem and 2) provide fan service. At the very least, these fan service &quot;heroines&quot; should have some personalities to them and make them stand out from each other. [Character: 3]<br />
<br />
The art style reminds me of old school anime with its big eyes. It feels dated with the animation quality of recently adapted light novel anime—which is bad to say the least. It just feels loose and unrefined majority of the time. Fights have a floatiness to them and feels like there&#039;s not much impact. While I appreciate the fan service eye candy of Hina and Lynn, big breasts and plump thighs can only go so far to save an anime&#039;s art. OST and voice acting are not worth mentioning. [Art: 4] [Sound: 5]<br />
<br />
It might be another case of a good light novel/manga suffering from a poorly manufactured adaptation again. Who knows. But one thing I do know is that this is a bad anime. [Enjoyment: 4]

    Plunderer is like Sword Art Online. Just backwards. While the story is fascinating and the characters are very interesting and likeable, the realization of this anime is just poor. I haven&#039;t read the manga yet, but after watching the anime adaptation I&#039;m sure of one thing: Plunderer as an anime is a horrible adaptation. When watching this, you can clearly see that adaptations 1:1 just don&#039;t work out. People responsible for this anime haven&#039;t try to make a good show and instead decided to go with simply taking the original and transferring it into another media.  Because of that, the tv adaptation has a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345618">
        lot of flaws, which include wrong pacing and lack of any rhythm. Also, the animation looks just terribly bad and the colour palette reminds me of this in Paint. I do not recommend you watching this. I think if you are interested in the premise, you should instead try reading a manga, because the anime takes all the good things from it and serves it in the most repulsive form possible.
