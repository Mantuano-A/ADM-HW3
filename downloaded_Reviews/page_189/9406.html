    Like an undetected tumor, Fairy Gone wormed its way into the popular seasonal anime before it began airing. Soon enough it became clear this show would be nothing but a cancer. I just wanted a dark fantasy anime filled with fun action scenes! Was that so much to ask for? Instead, what I got was a borderline unwatchable train wreck. <br />
<br />
“Once upon a time, fairies were used as tools for war.”<br />
<br />
This tagline and promising poster art were the bait at the end of P.A.Work’s fishing rod, and they successfully baited me into watching it.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this is not about an army of Disney Tinker Bell fairies

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311091">
        wielding rifles. What we got was closer to a cheap Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure knock-off; suspiciously the fifth part of Jojo was airing at the same time as this. Each main character is a soldier possessing one of these fairies: which are super-powered monsters that can be summoned at will during fights. They are the gimmick of this show, nothing else is original. Although the fairy&#039;s had enigmatic designs, they are animated with janky CGI at a low frame rate. The fairies look like otherworldly monsters, which fits their alien way of moving, if only it weren’t nauseating to look at. The fairies are tied to each user’s life, if it is injured, the user will receive damage as well. If it is damaged too much then it will need to recover before the next summon. These rules are frequently at play during fairy fights, which adds to the tension and the consequence of death or serious injury. When Fairy Gone is at its best, the soldiers fight each other in sword duels or rifle shoot outs while their fairies mirror their fight on a larger scale. There only a handful of these fights though; usually the protagonist is injured, preventing her from summoning her fairy. The fairies have abilities useful to each soldier’s specific fighting preference; the sword fighter has a werewolf brawler, the rifleman has a fire wielder, and a sniper has a long distance lookout fairy. If action and fairy fighting were the focus of this show it may have been good. Unfortunately, P.A. Works prioritized mind-numbingly boring dialogue rather than action. That brings us to the elephant in the room, the exposition dumps.<br />
<br />
At the end of every episode, I was always left overwhelmed by all the information that was dumped onto me. After reading through the Wikipedia summaries for the sake of this review, I can say that there is definitely a story! But it’s only the skeleton of one. There’s no substance, no delivery, there is still no reason to care about Fairy Gone. If you told me this show was written by a robot, I would believe you. It’s like the P.A. Works anime machine went down a checklist of all the necessary parts to a political fantasy story.<br />
<br />
1. Name the main guy something cool, like Free Underbar… Genius.<br />
2. We need some giant edgy monsters to fight each other in epic duels, just call it supernatural.<br />
3. Add a femme fatale and name her Bitter Sweet, because she is bitter and sweet. Damn, give these writers a raise.<br />
4. Make the main characters trust the femme fatale so that she can betray them, then repeat that cycle a couple of times. People like twists, right?<br />
5. Add politics to appeal to the intellectuals. Do any of our writers know how to write political drama? No? Just wing it.<br />
6. Make a villain walk through a barrage of bullets while whistling and chuckling like a lunatic, for five minutes straight, without getting a single scratch on him. Logic be damned!!<br />
<br />
“Show, don’t tell” is a rule all great stories follow, and if they don’t they end up like Fairy Gone. We are given dozens of names of places, people, and things, with no reason to care other than the hope it will be important later on. The exposition dumps are paced so slowly, but then the transitions from one location to the next are so breakneck fast that you’ll spend most of the new scene figuring out what’s going on. To the show’s credit, much of the information does get reincorporated later. Are you likely to remember everything by the time it becomes important? Not likely. I know I didn’t. I could only manage to recognize certain character names as they got introduced in person, rather than by a narrator. Once a previously named character meets the protagonist, she gives a sliver of information to know the basic outline of what is happening. Dialogue this repetitive usually makes a show worse, but without it, the story would be incomprehensible. Some context is better than none, I suppose. Some of the info dumps are just a bunch of random old dudes discussing politics for a while. At the beginning, there are some emotional stakes in the show worth caring about, but it is quickly forgotten.<br />
<br />
The protagonist, Marlya, has one interesting motivation, her relationship with Veronica. She is a fairy wielder fighting for the enemy. Her fairy is so badass, it enters people’s wounds and blowing them up inside out. Through flashbacks, we find that they were childhood friends, separated during a chaotic invasion, leaving them on different sides in the aftermath. If Fairy Gone had played to its strengths, it would have developed the duality between Marlya’s choice to defend the greater good opposed to Veronica’s goal to seek revenge against the government. Needless to say, it did not develop this relationship past the first episode. Marlya acts determined to speak to Veronica and mend their friendship, but it never happens. A plotline the second season will likely address. The rest of the story feels deplorable, you could read a Wikipedia summary instead and lose absolutely nothing. There is no benefit to watching this anime, it looks so bad that you would be better off just reading about it.<br />
<br />
P.A. Works is known for their beautiful artwork and consistent animation, neither of which is anywhere to find in this anime. At first, there was some good background art here and there. Early on there was greatly detailed forestry, overgrown moss covering dilapidated castles, dynamic lighting as the time of day changes. But that’s as far as my praise for the art will go. It wasn’t anything special, but it was detailed. The visuals quickly devolve into a mess of awful animation. Zoom shots are used ad nauseam to convey motion, sometimes so poorly that you can see the big ass pixels all over the screen! Character designs are off model 100% of the time unless if the shot is a close-up. This is a huge problem from the start of episode one until the end. Even in the first shot of the opening, Marlya’s face looks weirdly disproportionate and missing details of her normal design. Calling the lazy character art a distraction would be an understatement. There’s no way to enjoy anything without being reminded how ugly everyone in it looks. <br />
<br />
An opening is meant to show off the best visuals to get you hyped, but it shows the worst of it, foreshadowing the rapid decline in art quality. The song is pretty good though, it could do without the Engrish and rap/talk-singing. I wish the rest of the soundtrack was as good, but it’s generic and forgettable. The whole OST contains only a couple of songs replayed over and over. As for the ending song, it’s much better, great vocals and piano backing. The ED begins just before the end of each episode as if to signify that something epic just took place, but I was always left thinking “That’s it? Really?” I watched the ending credits every time trying to piece together what I just watched and why the show thought it was so important. <br />
<br />
[Final Score: 2/10]<br />
Fairy Gone is the bankruptcy of creativity. It is not a real anime. Rather, this show is a giant block of shit molded to look like a real anime. How could I possibly care about this piece of crap if even the people making it didn&#039;t even care? If you managed to watch this show until the end you likely fall into one of these three categories: you are in denial, you’re REALLY skilled at selective blindness, or you wanted peaceful slumber. Or you are like me and you were curious if it would get better. Let me spare you the trouble with a quick answer—it only gets worse.

    Fairy is gone or not? We will never know it.<br />
<br />
When I heard about Fairy Gone, I was kinda excited. Original 24-eps fantasy anime is a rare guest in the modern era of isekai and CGDCT series, and P.A.Works is a well-known studio that is always don&#039;t afraid of experiments with different genres and ideas. Just imagine this: a dark fantasy world of swords and magic, brutal action, post-war life of abandoned soldiers, and Persona... I mean, Stand... nope, Fairy! It sounds really great. Seriously, you have JoJo&#039;s director, original idea, and a great chance to become a headliner of this season, what can go wrong?

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308315">
        Spoiler: literally everything. Mediocrity wins again.<br />
<br />
The first episodes of this anime are the perfect example of how NOT to make a fantasy story. It looks like bad fanfiction written by a 14-years old teenager who read a few chapters of Eragon, watched Goblin Slayer, and decided to make his own dark fantasy without knowing of anything that makes fictional worlds believable and realistic. Here we have: random namedropping of random cities, random objects and random abilities, dialogue exposition, and, of course, flashbacks, because who doesn&#039;t like flashbacks? We put flashbacks in your flashbacks, and you can watch flashbacks while you watch flashbacks because it&#039;s a really great way to develop your world! Each episode consists of: flashback — pointless dialogue about some things — pointless dialogue with exposition — flashback — horrible drawn fight — another flashback. Add bad pacing and directing, cut, mix, and repeat for every 24 episodes. <br />
<br />
Maybe in the creator&#039;s head, this show looks logical and well-written, but for me, it&#039;s really hard to understand even what the hell is going on. The world in this show looks flat and generic, and the creators tried so hard to develop it that completely forgot about the characters, who are extremely bland too. Girl and guy with brown hair vs girl and guy with blond hair; some of them were childhood friends, but now they are enemies because of reasons, and fights with each other for some reason, here we have another flashback about them or something... but who actually cares?<br />
<br />
But really, who cares about the story and characters, if we have fairies and bloody battles with them? Perfect weapon who can give us epic action scenes, right? Wrong. All fairies and their battles are made with CG (because everybody loves CG, of course), and if action scenes without fairies look nice, fairy battles look like ugly models from PS1 game fight with each other. Boring and painful to watch. Smart, tactical battles? Forget about it, too. This show has nicely drawn backgrounds and passable animation, but CG elements ruin all experience. My favorite moment? Spider truck from episode 2. It was so fucking stupid that I couldn&#039;t stop laughing.<br />
<br />
Fairy Gone is trash in its purest form. Everything in this show is an example of &quot;how not to make an original anime&quot; without literally any enjoyable moments, except for some pretty good backgrounds. I wanted to drop it at ep 1 but decided to give it some chances, don&#039;t know why. Maybe I really hoped that this show will become better, maybe I like to watch some trashy anime, or maybe I just don&#039;t know what to do with my life, who knows. Of course, I&#039;ll continue watching because I&#039;m really interested in how deep can this anime fall. P.A.Works, really, stop. Kuromukuro, Sirius The Jaeger, and now Fairy Gone — why are you hating us so much? Stop doing trash fantasy, trash mechas, and other trash, and come back to the cute girls&#039; genre, please.

    I want to say congratulations to P.A. Works. Congratulations on making an original anime that I found almost as lifeless as Glasslip. Mind you, that’s an impressive feat. I’m a big fan of P.A. Works when it comes to their work so saying this wasn’t easy. But man, Fairy Gone is a show that I wish I watched on an airplane so I can forget about it after I land.<br />
<br />
P.A. Works seems to have two modes for their projects: it’s either really creative that makes a supreme impression or something that looked like it could’ve be written by a college dropout. As a fan of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311088">
        P.A. Works, I’ve seen anime that were great, average, and terrible. Fairy Gone gets the honor of being uncharismatic trash. Because to be honest, even when there are garbage like Glasslip out there, that show managed to deliver some unintentional humor. Fairy Gone’s humor is just…gone<br />
<br />
At first glance, I may sound a bit outspoken about this original show. Fairy Gone’s premise and story concepts sounds interesting on paper. I mean, just read that thing on the MAL page. “Once upon a time, fairies were tools of war”. When you get an impactful statement like that to start off a synopsis, it sounds like a deafening roar for potential. Even the setting sounded creative enough for world building. My initial vision for the show is a tragic, memorable fantasy war story with meaningful characters and breathtaking plot. After watching the first few episodes, a voice told me I was dead wrong for it managed to drop the ball week after week and after week. To get a general idea, we meet the main female protagonist Marlya Noel, a girl who survived and lives in the aftermath of the War of Unification. With an ability to see fairy primordials, she has one goal in her mind and that’s to find her childhood friend, Veronica. It doesn’t take long for the audience to meet Veronica as she debuts in the very first episode. Her true goals are a mystery but involves collecting pages of a mysterious artifact known as the Black Fairy Tome. It doesn’t help that the show throws info dump about the war at you with a lot questions that needs answers. <br />
<br />
But backtracking a bit, Fairy Gone isn’t that confusing as a show together. I mean, we have anime about supernatural organizations with main characters dealing with tragic pasts in recent years. Bungou Stray Dogs, Kekkai Sensen, P.A. Work’s own Sirius are just a few to name. What makes Fairy Gone troubling is its oversaturated character cast with a weak set of main stars. I’m not going to lie, Marlya doesn’t give me the impression of a special snowflake despite her unique gift. There are scenes in the first few episodes that makes her feel helpless compared to some of her comrades. On the other hand, there’s Veronica who will no doubt make us wonder why she exists. Unfortunately, I don’t really get Veronica as a character. On the surface, there’s the childhood relationship between her and Marlya. As explored through some flashbacks, it’s told through with words and scenes to make them look like close friends. But do we care? I’ll be honest because I don’t. It feels way too scripted that follows some sensational dialogues and face expressions. Somehow, the show seeks to make a memorable impression of this character relationship. When in reality, it missed the mark by a long shot. <br />
<br />
In the present, we also meet characters like Free Underbar who partners with Marlya during their missions. Joining them in the Dorothea branch also includes Klara, Serge, Lily, Robert, Oz, Nein, Chima, and some doctor’s name I can’t remember. Oh right, Eleanor Need. Mind you, this is just one branch consisting of characters with given names. With such an oversaturated cast, most of them are left in the dust with little screen time compared to the main stars. It’s a shame because our main characters can’t carry the show at all with their uninspiring personalities. You can bet that none of the others can either.<br />
<br />
Fairy gone more or less follows a war story with its themes. Director Kenichi Suzuki previously worked on titles such as Drifters. However, it’s definitely not charismatic as that show. To be fair, Fairy Gone losses its energy almost whenever a character opens their mouth. The dialogues sounds so scripted that I can’t imagine how much I can endure after every week. As time went on, even some of the fights begins to look scripted although it does manage to bounce back occasionally with its cinematic performances. At the very least, P.A. Works seems to have a tolerable budget to work with this anime given the overall animation quality. On the other hand, I do wish they stop overusing similar music every episode during the big fights. It makes it look more like an AMV than a fight at all. <br />
	<br />
This is a disaster. It’s a disappointing disaster considering what potential it had. When Fairy Gone was first advertised with its trailers, narratives, and key visuals, I was hoping to see another worthy show to join P.A. Works’ original lineup. Instead, forget about all that because this is one of those anime that failed with what potential it had. There, I just saved you many boobless hours.

    Fairy gone is a rather odd show to be honest. But probably that is the reason I am liking it so much.<br />
<br />
Nowadays 90% of the animes are going with very straightforward storytelling since the average anime fan seems to be allergic to brainwork. Instead of the usual approach of spoonfeeding any and every relevant information so even the greenest vegetable won&#039;t get lost, Fairy gone starts off with an &quot;In medias res&quot; opening, without explaining much of anything. Then slowly, episode by episode builds up the world. I would say they are doing it excellently, if you pay attention, it is not too hard to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308783">
        piece things together. Still, with every &quot;mystery&quot; solved a new one appears, which the show will get to in due time. This means most of the time you won&#039;t know the full picture, there will be a lot of unanswered questions, but be patient, eventually everything will be answered.<br />
<br />
The story is quite complex, it is something like a political-action-drama. I would say it is for a rather mature audience. The show is set in a post-war era, which is rather unique, most animes about the war, where the hero serves justice and defeats the evil. Fairy gone digs a lot deeper than that. It is not all just black and white, everyone has a good reason for their actions. There are a lot of people names and locations thrown around, but eventually, you will learn the more important characters&#039; name, and the name of the locations isn&#039;t that important, I don&#039;t remember a single one, and I have no problem understanding what&#039;s going on. They are just there for lore, if you are really intersted you can look up a map and place the events, but you are totally fine if you don&#039;t do anything with them.<br />
The story is moving quite slowly, although still there&#039;s quite much going on, also there are numerous cool fight scenes. From the beginning it is not quite clear where the story will develop. I would say it is a big plus for me since I am already sick and tired of nowadays all the anime are doing the same things over and over again, so they are very easy to predict. Finally, this is a story I don&#039;t know yet.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The show uses a mix of 2D and CGI. The 2D art is generally quite good, there are scenes that are really pretty and rarely there are scenes that doesn&#039;t look so great, but that happens in every show. Characters are having a western kind of desing, it reminds me of some old classics.<br />
They are using CGI for the stands/personas called fairies. However, they are definitely not just plainly copying the idea from those shows. Unlike the stands/personas, with the fairies they went for a realistic approach, therefore anime fans immediately labelled them ugly. But they are supposed to be ugly, they are terrifying monsters being able to rip people apart, do you want to look them like my little pony? With this realistic outlook, the CGI blends in with the 2D animation quite well, but still looks kind of otherworldly, as these fairies definitely don&#039;t belong to the human world. The rules are very different too: unlike the other 2 shows it is not only the stands/personas are fighting. Here the fairy user usually fights the other 2v2, user vs user and user vs fairy too.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
At first glance the characters might look bland, but by time with flashbacks and their present actions we will get to know them better, what are their motivations, goals. The &quot;villains&quot; have their reasons for doing what they are doing, in their shoes maybe you would do the same.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The music is great. There is almost always some undelying music fitting or setting the mood for the scene with a wide variety of styles. Also, the ending song is definitely the best of the spring season.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
This anime is definitely not for everyone. If you are interested in an anime with a grand theme, a complex story with a lot of underlying threads and in the meanwhile some pretty cool action, don&#039;t listen to the masses, be sure to check this out. It is natural to not understand a lot of things at the very beginning, you will get your clues in later episodes so eventually you will be able to piece the puzzle together.<br />
Overall I am giving it an 8/10 now, but if the story wraps up nicely, we&#039;ll get some more good character developement, cool action and in the end everything falls into place, I can see myself rating it even a 10/10.

    Every so often there comes a show that flys under the radar for one reason or another. Usually it’s about a niche thing that a select handful can truly appreciate. Sometimes it has a slow start and then evolves into something fascinating. Whatever the case, every season there is unfortunately a show that fits those monikers. This seasons victim is Fairy Gone. <br />
<br />
Early on Fairy Gone definitely had some potential. The story being set up seemed to be one of revolution with loyalty and relationships being tested with a hint of vengeance. Throw in some supernatural elements and Fairy Gone had the makings of a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311102">
        Fairly Good story (pun somewhat intended). Over the twelve episode first cour run however, Fairy Gone was a letdown. The story that it had set up for itself was seeming abandoned. Episodes would start off making reference to something that you received no background on. They would skip around tackling different subjects in their world with no explanation as to why they are important. In order for people to get invested in a story you must first flesh it out, something the writers of the show must know little about. Even with a weak story, shows can be saved by having interesting characters. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Fairy Gone they take their same approach to fleshing out a story to flesh out their characters. In the beginning episodes we are introduced to our main cast. We get to see their goals, aspirations, and grudges. The potential is there for some character interactions and development. Twelve episodes in and there is little to no development to speak of. Heck even some of the characters that we saw within the first couple episodes are never seen or heard from again. Instead we get random filler characters that are thrown at us and all of a sudden we are supposed to care about them. Spoiler alert, nobody cares about them. One, they have no development. Two, they have no story. And three, they are robbing the screen time away from far more interesting characters. This is not how you write in characters. <br />
<br />
For now I am done ranting and would like to move on to the good things about Fairy Gone. Above I said that Fairy Gone is an overlooked show that doesn’t get the appreciation that it deserves even from someone like me that just spent two paragraphs berating its story and characters. Despite all this Fairy Gone does do some things right, even exceptionally well. One of those things is the art and animation. The art has a darker more serious tone that is grounded in its world. It doesn’t feel out of place for what it is trying to represent. As for the animation I feel it deserves some high praise. Each episode features fluid animation especially during fight scenes. CGI is used but it’s mostly only used for the fairy’s which honestly don’t look great but also don’t feel terrible either. They are just kind of meh I guess. <br />
<br />
Going back to the nicely animated fight scenes, I must mention something that made me impressed. Whenever there is a fight scene, which happens at least once per episode, there is an insert song that plays over it. Anime have done this in the past but usually it’s the OP or ED and they only do it one time over the course of the series. This isn’t the case with Fairy Gone. Each fight is given its own original fight song which when combined with the amazingly fluid animation instantly makes watching the episode and the series for that matter feel worth it. The opening song and ending song are equally as good with the OP getting me hyped for the episode while the ED just puts me in a good mood even if I know the story is going nowhere. <br />
<br />
Overall, Fairy Gone will probably be panned by the anime community as a boring, lackluster show making my review seem like a needle in a haystack. I do hope they fix the issues in the next cour so that it can have some relevance in the community or risk being gone from memory. (Pun intended)

    OK, so the first part is over. While 24 episode anime could get better by doing something with the plot, those 12 episodes that we have on hand are just bad.<br />
First problem: The plot. While it started like your typical adventure with goals for MC to achieve, it ended more like some &quot;slice of life cop story&quot; - simply put, nothing contributes to the main plot and nothing moves it. MC did not even get a bit closer to her goal, most of the cast simply does not have a goal to begin with. Yes, authors try to convince us there is some scheming and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311096">
        politics involved, but they look like child&#039;s first fan fiction.<br />
Second problem: The world: mismatch of styles, you have legged and wheeled vehicles, you have robots with medieval cannons and infantry with 20th century guns and heroes with swords. If I am to put aside the style, there arises a problem with world presentation: you are bombarded with dozens of organisations, and even more names, but the problem is - most of them will never appear again. Even some &quot;big dudes&quot; who are supposed to be major figures in the world appeared a few times and were never heared about after that. What was even the point? Oh, and from this comes another problem:<br />
Third problem: The characters. Cause there are so many of them, even the MC crew are never given any development. We get all the story from uninteresting flashbacks, while characters themselves sometimes behave nothing close to those flashbacks. As example: cool army dude who survived on the frontlines and is tough as nails can&#039;t beat anyone in main story. And that is not even the worst part of the problem, main villain is given powers and skills, but wins battles not by using them, but by turning everyone around him in stormtrooper. A waste of potential, if you ask me.<br />
Fourth problem: The art. CG is terrible and looks out of place, 2D can give you sometimes a fine image, but sometimes it goes into &quot;where did my budget go&quot; area, with faces and figures simplified to a laughable result. It could be ok if it only occured in mass scenes, but with 2 or 3 characters on screen simplified faces made with a few lines look really terrible.<br />
The only good thing: music. Yes, this is the only point that felt satisfying. But good music in an action anime is not able to pull it from the pit of its problems.<br />
<br />
Overall: this anime is disappointing: it was an original, it had a potential, interesting timeline + interesting powers, but the execution of every single idea failed miserably. I recommend avoiding this one and saving yourself time.<br />

    Forget the plot.  Disregard the characters.  And abstain from having a central theme.  Just find a way to have the f—king fairies fight each other!<br />
<br />
Normally, machismo-laden, mindless fights are a surefire way to draw in a large audience.  Especially nowadays in the age of instant gratification and infinitesimal attention-spans.  But you can only treat the viewer like a brainless imbecile for so long, before they rebel and give you the collective middle finger.<br />
<br />
“Fairy Gone’s” plot is reminiscent of a ball of yarn.  It’s a jumbled mess of string (plot ‘threads’) going in every which direction.  Yet instead of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308313">
        clarifying the various loose ends, it continually adds more string to muddle the waters even further.  To mitigate this failing, P.A. Works — the studio behind “Fairy Gone” — attempts to suffocate the viewer with unbridled, senseless action.  The combatants for these battles (i.e. the fairies) are 3D abominations.  It’s a crude, pale aesthetic that lacks artistic detail to bring the work alive.<br />
<br />
Marlya and Veronica, the two central characters in “Fairy Gone,” have flatlined on account of improper characterization; thus, inhibiting the viewer’s willingness to become emotionally invested in their cryptic past.  A past that seems to be the impetus for events to come.  The other characters are rudimentary with no one displaying a personality beyond some hackneyed quirks.  They are, if nothing else, the personification of classic tropes<br />
<br />
Lastly, the enjoyment is meager.  The battle choreography is sloppy and the pacing is rushed.  The OST is undistinguished and it is unclear as to how P.A. Works will homogenize this rubbish, or whether it will opt to double down on force feeding the viewer with unavailing action ad nauseam.  If you are looking for a show with a post-war narrative backdrop, special powers galore, and better character developments — then watch “Full Metal Alchemist” instead of this diarrhea.

    Fairy Gone? More like @kataneer&#039;s succinct words: Fairy is TRULY Gone.<br />
<br />
This series brings back a ton of similarities to when P.A.Works and its staff were wanting to focus on more original stuff with interesting but overwhelming storylines, decent action-animation, and a lombastic OST to boot. That my friends, is the debut of last year&#039;s Sirius the Jaeger, the vampire show that is at least good, if not decent.<br />
<br />
Fast forward another year or so, and with the director of the beloved Hataraku Saibou, and the abominable scriptwriting and composition of Ao Jumonji, comes Fairy Gone: a clusterfuck of political warfare, the power of friendship, and mindless

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311098">
        power struggles. So much so that my ridicules of people telling me that &quot;I don&#039;t understand&quot;, is truly an understatement.<br />
<br />
So first, the story:<br />
No.1, A story of the post-political war, where everyone can reside in peace...if not for the mechanical figures called &quot;fairy soldiers&quot;. With a blow-whistle, their commands to the masters at ever beck and call.<br />
No.2 A story about power struggles amongst mafia groups on the verge of assassinating one another when there&#039;s enough power to knock off opponents and their &quot;summoning fairy&quot; powers.<br />
No. 3 A story about 2 girls, one lucky and the other, not so lucky. Marlya, a cursed child that bemoans and begets experiences while the other (Veronica) is smart and evasive (and it shows), but somehow that &quot;friendship&quot; tag seems to have been dropped off at some point.<br />
<br />
And to think that this is ONLY the 1st cour? Well, well, wait for the Fall season to rethink all these thoughts again. And yes, P.A.Works, we&#039;re waiting.<br />
<br />
The characters themselves are like too, a clusterfuck of characters that I can relate to some, but most of them (plus the royal ministers) are just too much deadweight to carry through.<br />
Starting with Dorothea, the fairy organization posed to help bring peace unto the nation (that is United Zesskia), Marlya, Free Underbar, and their band of mercenaries come off as a group that is somewhat similar to daily-patrolling officers doing their duty to keep that peace running.<br />
Add into the mix, the Seven Knights (Ray Dawn, Beevee Liscar and more to come), with their positions literally sounding like champions for causes, it&#039;s no wonder that as much as their background duties offer their façade and double-personality side of being traitors of a once political country.<br />
Adding EVEN more fuel to the fire is the various mafia groups (Gui Carlin, Arcame) doing their own illegal shiz behind the scenes, and good luck trying to piece their connections (if you&#039;re paying extreme attention).<br />
<br />
And as usual, I really wanted to advocate for P.A.Works&#039; track record at shows they have done before (yes, we&#039;re looking at you Glasslip). The BAD side of P.A.Works. I don&#039;t know about you, but it seems that in recent times, the studio&#039;s magic in quality art and animation has begun its downfall with either experimentation of the tried-and-true formula of Sirius the Jaeger. Don&#039;t get me wrong, while the latter has some good spots here and there which makes it decently enjoyable, Fairy Gone is a convoluted mess of 2D artwork meshed with 3D &quot;fairy&quot; figures, while animation-wise it took a nosedive, while offering good scenic visuals. And that&#039;s all I have to say about it.<br />
<br />
On the music side, [K]NoW_NAME is the anchor musician for the entire series, and I&#039;d have to say that I was not prepared for the great-sounding BGM songs during the series&#039; action plots, along with the literally &quot;Knock on the Core&quot; OP. It sounded great, but that&#039;s as much excitement as I will be getting for this series alone. Others were meh to OK.<br />
<br />
Fairy Gone&#039;s 1st Cour is an absolute failure, how can Kenichi Suzuki and his production staff reel from this? It&#039;s time to either get cracking or change the formula altogether. Either way, 2 seasons to go. Let the 2nd Cour justify the underwhelms we have here.<br />

    I´m actually a bit surprised about the amount of hate, negative critique, bashing and low scoring Fairy Gone Part 1 has received both during and after its airtime. I really can´t understand most of the foundations of said hate and bashing either, I thought the show had several good qualities and enjoyed most parts of it. So, I will give my slightly more positive point of view in this review.<br />
<br />
Shortly described, Fairy Gone centres around a continental scale political intrigue in a post war society. Before the war several nations existed, which most fought for its independence, but the outcome of the war was the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311267">
        unification of the continent under one leader and the war came to be called the unification war. In this world creatures called Fairy´s exists, which has different special abilities and strengths. Humans as they are had found a way to exploit that in the context of war, by taking organs from the Fairies and implant them into compatible humans. The Fairy enhanced humans can therefore summon the Fairy and use it as they please, which was a crucial part of the outcome of the war. After the war ended, these types of human-fairy hybrids became illegal to produce, and the ones left was ordered to work for the government owned agency Dorothea or classed as outlaws. The story takes place some 10 years after the wars end, where a fragile peace is threatened by multiple sources, and we get to follow characters on different sides of the brewing conflict. <br />
<br />
In addition to the main political intrigue, there is side themes such the search of a childhood friend, and the mystery about something called the Fairy Tombs which is old texts written by scholars who studied the Fairy´s and collected the knowledge into five books. These books are now highly wanted and valued by many, especially the Black Fairy Tomb, which explores something called “Fairy possession”, which is a rare occurring phenomenon of a Fairy fusing with a human without any surgery.<br />
<br />
As foundations, I think these are interesting themes which they use, explore and develop during these first 12 episodes. Overall, this is more a story driven show rather and character driven one, which could be a `yay`or `nej`for some. The pacing is typical for this kind of plot, with some shorter arc format, where we get to know the characters and their connections, the structure and background of their society, and clues to the schemes that brewing in the Empire. I liked this concept and was always looking forward to a new episode and what it would explore. Is this the most unique and well written work ever done? Of course not, but I found it enjoyable in many aspects, and it do build on itself nicely. I much prefer these types of stories from P.A. Works before their slow-paced unrealistic dramas that they usually produce.<br />
<br />
Fair waring though, Fairy Gone do demand your attention and focus to understand the connections of all story threads it has going on, geographical places and to keep track of all the characters (there are quite many). So, if you are looking for something you can enjoy while browsing your phone or watching with just half your attention, don´t bother. It will not be enjoyable since you will have no idea what´s going on.<br />
<br />
There are some direction issues, where they choose to just show short glimpses of backstory (often non-linearly and geographically hard to place as well) spread out over several episodes instead of having one proper backstory episode were things would been more coherent. Fairy Gone also has so many things going on at the same time, and a large cast, which did not make it ultimately best watched on a weekly basis. I highly recommend watching it as coherent as possible time wise to get a good flow which will allow you to have all the names and places fresh in memory, and the experience will for sure get better that way.<br />
<br />
We mainly get to follow Marlya, a teenager who´s village was destroyed by one of the now ruling dukes when she was a child. She was one of the few that escaped alive together with her slightly older childhood friend Veronica. They get separated shortly afterwards, and Marlya has been looking for Veronica ever since. So, to survive alone in the world she joined a mafia group, and during an assignment she runs in to the Dorothea agent Free. During an incident that evening Marlya comes in the possession of a Fairy and joins Free to work for Dorothea. <br />
<br />
It is mainly though Marlya and Free and their missions we get to explore the story´s themes. Free is a fairy veteran from the war and carries the baggage that comes with it – lost comrades, the experiences of the battlefield and all the destruction it holds. Marlya is like most young women, slightly naïve in her world view, strong in her believes and emotions, but also struggles with self-doubt and survivals guilt. Even though neither of their characters was super unique or deeply developed I enjoyed them as mains and their dynamic. They form a bound throughout their journeys and starts to trust and support each other with a tenderness rarely showcased in anime. Their interactions were actually one of the highlights of the show for me. There so many more characters, and many still haven´t been explored nearly enough either, such as the more important characters Wolfarm and Veronica, which only have gotten the base exploration so far. But with 12 episodes left in the second cour, I still have my hopes up.<br />
<br />
I think P.A. Works has done a great job with the art and animation; it looks good. It also holds the quality along the way, and some parts like the CGI fairies even improves (they looked kind of out of place in the beginning). The characters have their own distinct design which can´t be confused with any other works.  The backgrounds are often detailed, beautifully coloured and highlights the scene. Like a golden lit stone cobble street at night, a library filled with books in the light of an open fire or the ruins of a long-abandoned castle, it all looks very good and creates a suiting atmosphere. The fight scenes are fluid and detailed, and the animation overall besides the CGI is seldom jerky or sloppy. Cuddos to P.A. Works for that.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is probably a hit or miss for most people, it contains a lot of vocal tracks. I quite enjoyed, and for most parts I think they matched the music well with the scene. The VA´s was well matched and did their job well, no complains there at all.<br />
<br />
I might belong to the minority that actually thought Fairy Gone Part 1 was a good and interesting show and was enjoying it, but I guess I belong to the minority of this site as well (female and 30+). I think it had a lot of good things going on for it with just some miner downsides that I could easily cope with. And with 12 more episodes to go, it still could develop from good to great, depending on which themes and routes they decide to develop. So, I can warmly recommend Fairy Gone to any that can live with conditions I just mentioned and enjoy it for what it is.<br />

    I&#039;m so tired of people talking negatively about this anime, it&#039;s honestly a great series, it&#039;s my 2nd fave of the season after KNY. The only thing they need to do is fix the CGI, some of the cuts they make during episodes and slow up with dropping so many location and people names, tbh it gets overwhelming to get 10-15 European sounding place names dropped per episode lol, overall solid 8/10 for me. The premise of the series is really interesting with the fairies, war and political drama that you have going on. Some people have joked that it&#039;s basically JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure(the fairies),

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309211">
        I have never seen JoJo&#039;s so I can&#039;t comment on that. For me, the concept is fresh and enjoyable. I really love the Character designs, art style, animation and music. Like I said, just fix the CGI and cuts and it&#039;ll be fine.<br />
<br />
 I hope that the second cours in October fixes these issues as they&#039;re pretty simple. Once they do that, it&#039;ll be perfect.

    While browsing through the list of spring 2019 anime, I happened to stumble upon Fairy Gone. After reading the synopsis, I was fairly interested in the show and decided to give it a watch. Oh, for the love of Haruhi Suzumiya, why. Why did I do this to myself?<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll start off by saying that the art and music were pretty good. The characters had emotional expressions, and the backgrounds were detailed. The fight scenes were kinda sucky because of the god awful CG they used to animate the faires, but other than that it was fine. The OST was nice, I&#039;ll give it that, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309866">
        the opening was fairly catchy.<br />
<br />
And now we come to the story. At first, I was genuinely curious about the concept of transplanting the organs of dead fairies into people to use them as war machines. Pretty decent idea. I love dark fantasy like this. But as the show went on... everything just became so goddamn confusing. The anime had so much going on, with so many subplots and central plots and settings and characters and unexplained rules and gradually, it just became...a mess. Also, why the fuck is there a fairy mafia? What the actual FUCK?! In addition to that, why was it suddenly illegal to transplant faires after the war? Is it because it would be dangerous? What was even the point of having fairy soldiers instead of regular soldiers in the first place? So many unanswered questions. This, ladies and gentlemen, is not how you write a fantasy story. <br />
<br />
When you are writing any, and I mean ANY, piece of fictional work, you have to lay down basic rules from the very beginning. You have to establish a world with order and a sense of reason, and make sure your audience understands these rules from the very beginning. I&#039;m a writer myself (albeit not a professional one) and I can tell you from personal experience that if you don&#039;t have basic guidelines such as these, your story is going to turn into a flaming, messy piece of shit. If you just barf out all of your ideas onto a piece of paper and don&#039;t explain/show/come up with a reason how or why those ideas are proportionate and necessary to the story, your audience will become extremely confused and bored (like I was three episodes into this shit.) However, if you also try to cram all of your ideas into one piece of dialogue or overstuff the story with unnecessary plots and details, your story is going to feel messy and bloated. It&#039;s a very fine balance that storytellers have to master. It can never be too much, but it can also never be too little.<br />
<br />
Fairy Gone has no guidelines, no rules, and reaches such levels of absurdity that I had to sit down and stare at a wall for about five minutes after each episode, contemplating what the fuck I had just witnessed. While characters were also very cliche, with flimsy motivations and weakly defined personalities, the story was what really caused me to hate Fairy Gone After enduring three episodes of this garbage. After the third episode, bored and confused out of my fucking mind, I decided that there was no humanly possible way that I could endure 21 more weeks of watching this. I dropped the show, then came back after three weeks to see if it had improved it all, and quickly dropped it again. I would not recommend this show to anyone.<br />

    P.A. works is a studio I have a pretty positive history with. Charlotte, Another, Angel Beats, Canaan. Seems every time I review something of theirs, I like it quite a bit. This time, we&#039;re looking at Fairy Gone. An original anime by them from early 2019. Let&#039;s take a look and hope for the best. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
We open to a flashback talking about the end of a war over unification where we see two young girls fleeing their village as it&#039;s destroyed. We also hear about fairy soldiers and see a group of them throw down their arms. Cut to the story proper, our heroine, Marlya,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review355503">
        considers herself cursed since people always seem to die around her. Obviously, she&#039;s one of the girls from the village flashback and she&#039;s searching for the other, Veronica. She&#039;s acting as a guard at a mafia auction when she meets our hero, Free, a former fairy soldier. After an incident, she joins the organisation Dorothea which investigates illegal uses of faeries and flirts with the organisation Petra. Both Free and Marlya quickly find themselves facing old friends from the past and trying to unravel a plot against the unified government. <br />
<br />
There are a couple significant issues with this series. First off, the world building is pretty sub-par. It feels like a lot of it comes through flashbacks that are a bit dull or through exposition that&#039;s a bit stilted. The pacing is also a bit awkward. Some major plot points get rushed through while you get flashback sequences and other bits that just drag on quite as bit. The climax is also kind of weak and features some really dumb moments. Like, there&#039;s a part where an antagonistic character is walking very slowly towards a gate while a bunch of nameless guards shoot at him and they all miss like they were trained by Cobra. Honestly, the way he moves so slowly and all these dipshits can&#039;t be bothered to aim just makes it seem like a parody rather than something we&#039;re supposed to take seriously. <br />
<br />
I do like the concept of the series. The idea of people being surgically implanted with faeries that basically act as like the Personas from the game franchise of the same name. Those people having a limited place in ordinary society because of the legal status of their personae, I mean faeries. Those are all good ideas that could have been used much better than they are here. The series also does do a somewhat good job of handling the theme of survivor&#039;s guilt. Both our main characters have issues with it because they can&#039;t help but remember the situations where they lost people and couldn&#039;t do anything about it. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
To be blunt, the only thing that gives the protagonists any real depth is the survivor&#039;s guilt theme. You get some indications that they mean for the characters to be something more, but they never really amount to that much. The same isn&#039;t true with the antagonists. At least not with Wolfran and Veronica. They both clearly suffered some serious trauma during the war and they&#039;re both very clearly working towards something even if the anime says &quot;wait until the next series to find out the full details.&quot; It&#039;s still evident that P.A. has a plan in place. <br />
<br />
The character interactions aren&#039;t particularly appealing or that good. I like the dynamic betwixt Marlya and Veronica, it leads to some strong moments. But aside from that, I&#039;m kind of ambivalent towards all of them. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
This is one element where I can give the series full credit. It looks very nice. The action flows well. The characters are distinct. The backgrounds and various objects look good. The personae have very interesting designs. The Fairy Weapons, when they show up, have very nice designs. Looking intricate and decorated without being ostentatious. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The actors do really well. Ichinose Kana, Fukuhara Ayaka, Hosoya Yoshimasa, Suwa Ayaka, Sonozaki Mie and the others all give strong performances. The music isn&#039;t the best, but the series uses it very well. Ramping it up during big action scenes but keeping it pulled back enough that you can still hear the battle. And they use it very strategically which gives it more impact. <br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a little bit betwixt Veronica and Marlya. Klara also talks about the director, Nein, like a girl with a crush. I doubt they&#039;ll go in that direction with either of them, but I wouldn&#039;t complain if they did. <br />
<br />
Areas of Improvement:<br />
<br />
1. Build the world more naturally. Exposition has its purpose, but that purpose is, in general, not to provide a short cut so you don&#039;t have to really build your world. <br />
<br />
2. Those moments that give the characters hints of complexity need to be built on. <br />
<br />
3. You can&#039;t have a scene where a character walks slowly past a hail of gunfire. Unless that character can turn invisible or they have a shield like Magneto, it doesn&#039;t work. I know, you think it looks cool, but it&#039;s really dumb. <br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
Fairy Gone could have been a great anime. It had all the parts in place for it. But it&#039;s ultimately let down by under-written characters by sub-par world building by poor pacing. And by that exceptionally stupid climax. It&#039;s not a good series. It&#039;s not a bad series either. It ends up being quite average. Which is why I&#039;m giving it a 5/10. <br />

    &quot;Once upon a time, fairies were discount Jojo&#039;s Stands...&quot;<br />
<br />
Fairy Gone was one of LA&#039;s most anticipated for the Spring 2019 and well...LA won&#039;t drag this along but Fairy Gone was underwhelming and for this being a first season, it didn&#039;t give LA the best impression for this anime. Like Fairy Gone from it&#039;s outset was a PA Works original anime and with the setting of it being in an aftermath of a fairy war, so LA would have thought this would be a much dramatic, serious and character driven anime, it got one out of the three.<br />
<br />
Fairy Gone follows Marlya Noel voiced by Kana Ichinose,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311164">
        a fairy soldier who&#039;s extremely unlucky in her life with her trying to find her long lost friend Veronica Thorne voiced by Ayaka Fukuhara, she latter joins the Dorothean Army to uncover Fairy Weapons, a push to another Fairy War and again...to find Veronica again. Marlya does have the narrative focus in the anime, but Free Underbar voiced by Tomoaki Maeno also gets narrative focus with similar instances to Marlya in finding someone. The premise itself is fine, it&#039;s just the execution in it all and how slow-paced, bogged down in world building of the political structures, massive expositions and huge character backstory dumps that ultimately makes Fairy Gone an absolute slog. yes Fairy Gone DOES have it&#039;s moments, especially when it actually goes into it&#039;s climax and things starts going into motion, but it&#039;s the build up and how slow paced everything is just made the experience watching Fairy Gone.....meh.<br />
<br />
Fairy Gone&#039;s world building and character development was at LEAST decent in this respect and one of the core strengths to the anime, world building is very fleshed out especially with backstory of the previous war, current tech of the world of Fairy Gone and how intrinsic the fairy powers are (as much as it&#039;s apes from Jojo&#039;s Stands that LA joked at the start of the review) but Fairy Gone&#039;s world building was nonetheless very fleshed out. Character development does make the characters....decent, some not even needing backstory or development and we get their personality very easily. Of course Maryla and Free does get the majority of the character development and backstory but some of the Dorothean cast gets some backstory, sometimes outta nowhere...like Klara Kysenaria voiced by Ayaka Suwa. But again with how focused Fairy Gone is with it&#039;s world building and sporadic character backstory...it of course will slow down and bog down what is already very precarious, heavy plotlines and setting.<br />
<br />
PA Works nonetheless did a great job in the animation, cept in the Fairy Jojo Stands and the humanoid mecha, where the CGI was janky which is given some grace with the humanoid mecha, but man the Fairy Jojo Stands were blatant and out-rightly...ugly at times. JOJO&#039;s STANDS were animated better than this. PA Works nonetheless great in it&#039;s character designs and it&#039;s backgrounding, everything else....just meh...yes even the FIGHTS....and uhhh that&#039;s saying something.<br />
<br />
The voice cast at least make sup for it as the entire cast sounded like they did their all in this anime, from Kana Ichinose as Marlya, Tomoaki Maeno as Free and Ayaka Suwa as Klara. LA will gives special props to Kana Ichinose as Marlya and really the voice cast at least held up and they sounded like they did their all.<br />
<br />
Fairy Gone will have a second season but as much as this first season did go out with a bang at the ending, Fairy Gone&#039;s first season DID NOT give LA a best impression and with it also being one of LA&#039;s anticipated animes of Spring 2019 and failing in multiple elements....yeah...LA was HIGHLY disappointed by this without a doubt as it&#039;s weakness of being such a slow-paced, scattershoted expositional, character fillery plot just outweighed it&#039;s strengths of fleshed out world building and some decent character backstory. In the worse light reminded LA of another PA Works work, Glasslip where it fleshed out it&#039;s supernatural element but did NOTHING with it&#039;s characters or plot (at least Fairy Gone HAS some motivation with it&#039;s characters and it&#039;s story elements are utilized to a fair degree). And no just &quot;waiting for it to get better&quot; doesn&#039;t work for as LA is looking at the first season and first season only and LA was not impressed to say the least and with it announcing a second season...LA isn&#039;t jumping at the notion of watching the second season but LA WILL get to watching it, one time or another. Fairy Gone&#039;s first season can for LA be summed up in three words...<br />
<br />
Slow and DISAPPOINTED

    I rarely feel the need to write reviews, but this one&#039;s an exception. <br />
I feel like 7 episodes is more than enough to decide whether you like something or not.<br />
This review contains some spoilers I suppose.<br />
<br />
So, the first 2 or 3 episodes I quite enjoyed. They weren&#039;t amazing, but still enjoyable.<br />
However, the longer I watched, the more the problems became apparent. <br />
<br />
First things first, there are sooo many characters in such a short amount of time and very few of them you can get properly acquainted with to remember even their names. To be honest, I don&#039;t even remember the main characters&#039; names aside from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308837">
        Bitter Sweet and Veronica (but they aren&#039;t really main characters), even though I just watched the 7th episode. <br />
Most of characters don&#039;t do that much either. They&#039;re also mostly all pretty bland and mostly serve to just continue the plot.<br />
<br />
Second, I have no clue what they&#039;re trying to do with the story. Finding pages of a black tome that had like a one-minute vague explanation (without really knowing its importance either) way too many underlining plotthreads. That could be fine, if the writers knew what they were doing.  It feels like they&#039;re making it up as they go along. Instead, they never really resolve any of them, and keep adding more and more threads to it, to the point where it&#039;s difficult to keep up with what exactly is happening or why it&#039;s happening.<br />
<br />
Third, some of the voice casting is really mis-matched. For example, the Jesus looking guy&#039;s VA doesn&#039;t fit in the slightest and I felt the same for some other characters.<br />
<br />
Fourth, maybe they&#039;ll explore it later, but I find it odd how no one finds it strange how the fairy-people&#039;s existence has essentially been made illegal. Like, the main character just accepts that she either goes to jail, or join Dorothea, just because she exists. As I said, this could be explored later, but there&#039;s been no hint at that at all yet, so who knows. It would be a nice thing to explore, but it would&#039;ve been good to have some of that in the beginning. It would&#039;ve made for an interesting dynamic.<br />
<br />
Fifth, the amount of times they&#039;re jumping back and forth between flashbacks and present day, makes the timeline very confusing, even with the time cards they put before the scene. They use their own calendar, so we don&#039;t really have anything concrete to hold on to. Personally, I couldn&#039;t for the life of me remember, what year it was in what scene. Most of the time I could figure out quite easily whether or not it was a flashback, but the time cards didn&#039;t help at all. Relatively minor issue, but it bothered me. Same thing with the place cards.<br />
<br />
My final issue, which is my main issue somehow, is completely outside of the studio&#039;s control: it&#039;s the subs by Funimation. I&#039;ve been finding most of their subs quite awful this season, but this one takes the cake. I can&#039;t exactly speak for the translation (though at some points, even I notice it&#039;s really off), but so little of the dialogue reads well or fits with the tone of voice. This due mainly two reasons: stiff text and god awful on-screen placement.<br />
Stiff text speaks for itself, it just doesn&#039;t feel natural in the slightest for people speaking.<br />
The on-screen placement however, is my main issue. Normally when there&#039;s two things going on at once, in this case someone speaking and text on screen, you spread them out so it&#039;s readable. Funimation said, fuck no, we&#039;re not doing that, we place all subs at the top of the screen, with the text (which most often is just an introduction of the character&#039;s name and occupation) AT STACKED DIRECTLY ON TOP OF THE DIALOGUE, SO YOU READ THAT FIRST AND THEN THE DIALOGUE. When that happens, you miss what is being said, because you&#039;re trying to read his introductory text, but since it&#039;s so cluttered, you struggle with it. Usually, what would be good to do in these situation is have one thing at the top of the screen, and the other thing at the bottom of the screen. My only guess for not doing that is to not cover up the japanese text (in the bottom CORNER mind you), but I think it&#039;s safe to assume, that most of us sub reading weebs, don&#039;t know Kanji anyway, so why bother. It&#039;s stupid, and for some reason, &#039;triggered&#039; me by far the most about this show.<br />
At other points, they randomly place the subs at the top, for no apparent reason (that I could find anyway).<br />
To me that&#039;s just really offputting and bothered me the most about everything.<br />
Or maybe, the dialogue is just that awful. I feel like it&#039;s not though, considering Funimation&#039;s other subs this season.<br />
<br />
Animation and art is largely fine. There were some weird angles here and there, but animation is largely smooth. The fights are average at best. Sometimes I&#039;m not entirely sure what style they&#039;re trying to got for: steampunk, WW1, or fantasy.<br />
The CG doesn&#039;t bother me that much, I&#039;ve seen much worse. It doesn&#039;t stick out as much to me. <br />
<br />
Overal, I probably would&#039;ve watched it for a bit longer if it wasn&#039;t for the awful subs, but probably still have dropped in the end, because of the other things mentioned. It&#039;s sad, because P.A. Works generally delivers good work.<br />
Maaaybe I&#039;ll pick it up again if people are suddenly saying that it&#039;s really good all of a sudden, but that would be at the end of the season.

    &quot;Once upon a time,fairies were a tools of war......&quot; ?<br />
<br />
What the heck is that anyway the real tools of war were small arms and a good military strategy not fairies and well this my another review for now and this anime is entitled Fairy Gone although my review for this anime might be quite short here since i dropped this many weeks ago but anyway this review had already feel like i was pleaded guilty for watching this :(<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Story: it was recognizable at first but after i watch the first episode it might be just decent for now just for now..... and i think

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312203">
        i felt i was being pulled in to this world for watching it :|<br />
<br />
2. Art: it can be nice at first but later it becomes bad because of too much CGI for the art in the fairies (i would consider these so called &quot;fairies&quot; as just monsters that were came out from a graphic novel) in it and also the art for the characters is also just unbearable to look at :| last the but not the least the fight sequences they were more weak,lackluster and of course no thrilling action scenes it just makes me snored and put me to sleep<br />
<br />
3. Characters: we start of with a protagonist who&#039;s more like a weaker version of Carlos Hathcock or some random female Soviet sniper who&#039;s actually hits her target sometimes but also misses and also i can consider her as a dumbass so to speak,as for the other characters some of their names are either hard to pronounce or mostly some of it are just laughable to hear it (anyway most of these characters were mostly fairy soldiers that had war experience while most of these soldiers work for the mafia while some were worked in the orders of a random person)<br />
<br />
4. Sound: this is the only good thing in the show the OP was more of having bits of rock in it while the ED is just decent for that<br />
<br />
5. Enjoyment: This anime was just a poor excuse for P.A Works (anyway i do like their past works like Irozuku,Tari-Tari and Shirobako these animes are just watchable for me and this is where the studio is good at,making a good anime that deliver either a few SoL or Drama) this reminds me of how what they did to Glasslip which ended up badly (which i dropped many years ago and still haunts me to this day) and to be specific this where the studio is weak at making an action-esque anime that ended up in a failure for now... Let&#039;s see if that 2nd part of this anime will be in the same fashion or not?<br />
<br />
6. Overall: i gave this anime a 3 bcoz of it&#039;s forgettable story,unrecognizable plot and also the boring cast but in the end i will consider Fairy Gone as the studio&#039;s 2nd anime that bombed like a bad movie that was bombed at the cinema and ended up being unwatchable and also it tried put some &quot;The Godfather&quot;-esque mafia plot but doomed from the start and also story elements of the 2 once childhood friends were either removed from the show or just forget it for just more bad action scenes in the end Fairy Gone ended with some broken promises the already never kept<br />
<br />
P.S: if ur going to watch this anime then u will be sucked by a black hole of boredom but if you refuse to watch or dropped this show then u will be liberated by the angels from the far side anyway i will leave a quote by Lord Alfred Tennyson in order to end this review <br />
<br />
&quot;A lie which is half a truth is ever the blackest of lies&quot; (this means that Fairy Gone delivered those blackest of lies)

    I am so very disappointed by this show.<br />
<br />
The first episode was decent, the animation is great, and the main character was very cute.<br />
<br />
But that&#039;s where all the pros end. everything else is very very bad.<br />
<br />
AND BORING<br />
<br />
I was expecting some big epic plot to happen but all they did was look for some book while not accomplishing much of anything. <br />
<br />
<br />
They don&#039;t take their subplots anywhere<br />
They didn&#039;t make the main character and her &quot;stand&quot; interesting enough.<br />
The colors make you want to fall asleep.<br />
The universe isn&#039;t properly explored.<br />
IT DOESN&#039;T GO ANYWHERE.<br />
<br />
Avoid this anime at all costs. I thought it was going to be a great show like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312027">
        ergo proxy; boy was I wrong. Watch Mayonaka no Occult Koumuin instead, you&#039;ll get a lot more from it.<br />
<br />
This youtube video pretty much sums up how I felt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_vYTWmab18

    It has been so long since I wrote a review but this anime is truly GONE. Fairy GONE is a terrible anime with a terrible story to boot.  ~SPOILER FREE review~ TL;DR: Garbage anime do not bother watching, might cause brain damage.<br />
<br />
Story:2/10 <br />
The entire premise of the anime is shallow and does not have much of anything.  It just overloads you with mundane information and finishes the story way too quickly. It is just like a nightmare, but you could not escape from it.<br />
<br />
Art:6/10<br />
It has a decent art backing its disgraceful story. I cannot imagine how much money is spent on designing this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311152">
        piece of garbage, that is getting a second season. Truly disappointing with what is has done other than depicting the terrible storyline, it could have done some truly amazing things with their art. <br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
Pretty decent, it has the right sounds as the right time and have the story in its control. The music is what make one want to watch the story not the other way around. <br />
<br />
Character:5/10<br />
Pretty terrible character development, things happen and they just kill off characters as they deem fit. Too many characters and too little development to understand them and their motives to do the things they do. It become quite underwhelming when it is a seasonal anime that is supposedly hyped up. <br />
<br />
~ Overall: 5/10 ~<br />
Honestly, I would not recommend anyone to watch this. It might just give you brain damage for all I know, this garbage anime that is.<br />

    You know, I&#039;ll give P.A. Works this, the plot at least seems interesting this time.  Compared to Sirius&#039;s seemingly generic story idea or how Irozuku is situated in high school, this one at least has a new setting.  Unfortunately that&#039;s about the only pass for it I&#039;ve got...<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
The fractured continent was brought together under the name of &#039;Unified Zesskia&#039; nine years ago after a long period of war to unify the smaller nations thanks to the the liberal use of fairies and &#039;Fairy Soldiers&#039;, warriors created by implanting the creatures&#039; organs into suitable hosts.  As a victim of the war, Marlya Noel joins the neutral

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311144">
        faction of Dorothea as the tensions of this newly unified nation arise all the while a figure from her past appears amidst the chaos.<br />
<br />
Fairy Gone is a lot of things.  It&#039;s a series about the dirtied history and politics of the story&#039;s setting, the illegal activity involving three mafia families that each hold secondary power to the government, the secret of the &#039;Black Fairy Tome&#039; and the lore of the fairies, and one girl&#039;s journey to defy her own preconceived notions and search for her friend after the death of her village.  Just at a glance, the story of Fairy Gone is so incredibly dense with material that it actually begs the question what on earth P.A. thought was going to happen when they decided that they only had twelve episodes to pull maximum half of this off.<br />
<br />
As such, pacing is the one major issue this series has.  At any point in the series, the story is running at least two concurrent story threads where in one scene, we&#039;ll see members of Dorothea follow a lead for something before quickly switching to another perspective a few seconds alter that builds things up from behind the scenes, switching back, then conjoin the two so that the narrative fits together in the end for the story to come to a close.  However the mileage on how well this style of storytelling is executed is heavily variable due to how the story will sometimes bracket the secondary thread and elongate it into the next arc, therefore making it so that the conjoining point encompasses EVERYTHING seen before like some kind of domino effect.<br />
<br />
If the series had less plot threads than it did, it would&#039;ve worked out.  But unfortunately because of P.A.&#039;s narrative decisions, everything feels wholly incomplete: Marlya&#039;s story is largely thrown to the side a few episodes in as she&#039;s no longer the only focus, the interesting lore of the fairies and by extension the artificial fairies is never touched on to explain any details about them aside from what we see visually, the mafia families serve as more of a convenient plot element to throw in wrenches for the sake of adding more unnecessary characters, thus leaving the whole political element which by comparison is the only functional aspect of the story the series has.<br />
<br />
But even that&#039;s not really all that interesting because so many parts of the show make it abundantly clear that &#039;peace&#039; is impossible, so none of it is really a surprise the moment the series does a one-eighty by the end by unleashing the most predictable civil war possible given the numerous amount of anti-political sentiment shared among the side cast.<br />
<br />
Because of all of this, Fairy Gone falls into the unfortunate group of shows with &quot;Great Idea, Bad Execution&quot;, a trend that plagues P.A. Works to the point that I&#039;m not even surprised anymore.  Granted there is a season two airing October 2019, but the damage to the series is already done given how messy and incoherent the series already is as a result of its less than stellar story presentation and execution.  It&#039;s so goddamn rushed that I&#039;ve had to do a number of double takes to make sure I&#039;ve got everything down because there are an absurd amount of jump cuts and scene changes that it&#039;s just sometimes jarring to watch.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Marlya Noel is about the closest thing this series has to a protagonist.  A girl who considers herself unlucky due to the sheer amount of people that&#039;ve died around her because of her mere presence, a lot of Marlya&#039;s character revolves around her newfound purpose of trying to do right in Dorothea and searching for her friend, Veronica, who disappeared some time nine years ago after their village burns down.  Even with a new fairy embedded somewhere in her chest, the show doesn&#039;t make enough of an effort to make her a protagonist worth rooting for.  So much of her time is devoted to watching her mope around, including an entire episode devoted to hammering in how little she thinks of herself by revealing a backstory where some other dude in her past died with her around.  I find it really hard to root for her and wished the series sometimes just dropped her instead of using her to introduce things while also trying to grow her character.<br />
<br />
Free Underbar is another character I&#039;ll choose to mention only because both he and Marlya are rarely seen apart.  Free&#039;s character...isn&#039;t at all fleshed out, and this becomes a common trend amongst a majority of the cast.  Because the show is heavily focused on story above else, the bits of character that we are shown matter little in the long run, and that&#039;s no different with this man.  There&#039;re a few backstory moments like the day he gets his fairy and flashbacks from the war, but Free largely doesn&#039;t do anything aside from function as the Dorothea lapdog that he&#039;s made out to be.<br />
<br />
Similarly, most if not every other character follows a similar, unfortunate pattern of just being just a pawn in the grand story of this political nightmare.  And not in the good way.  Every episode to couple episodes reveals a new character in some form or another, whether or not they be members of Dorothea, government officials, &#039;mysterious figures&#039; with motives not shown (and probably will never be shown), mafia people who get stupid names like &#039;Bitter Sweet&#039; (seriously, what the hell), or people in flashbacks who ultimately don&#039;t matter because exploration of character is stupid and who needs that when we&#039;ve got a war to fight?!  It&#039;s best to see these characters as the stage puppets they are since ultimately their impact to the story is only skin deep at being a member of the some seven odd factions that exist in this series.  Because yeah, that makes sense to reveal in a twelve episode season.<br />
<br />
Aesthetics:<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not really a fan of P.A.&#039;s work this time around.  Fairy Gone lends itself to a darker aesthetic where the colors are more drab or dark with the few colors that do exist have themselves be muted to give off a more serious and mature look to the series.  On the note of characters, one thing that the style really likes to do this time is really exemplify the lips, particularly of the female cast where they either have a noticeable gloss to them that makes them pop out more and/or has a curl in the middle to make them seem more &#039;realistic&#039;.  Personally I&#039;m not a fan and it was weirdly distracting for me to see so much emphasis, especially on one particular character who seems like a big fan of botox.  Ultimately, the art itself is functional and still lends itself to the style, but compared to what the company is capable of, I&#039;m just not that impressed.<br />
<br />
The one thing I will note for art are the fairies and how despite being CGI monsters that clash with the typical style of the series, are genuinely interesting to look at.  Aside from the tiny primordials (who don&#039;t get an explanation), each fairy from the characters that wield them physically look different and are more reminiscent of European folklore&#039;s fae creatures that take on numerous horrendous or monstrous designs with their own unique skillsets.  I&#039;m just personally a fan because anything that uses the original meaning of fairy with interesting, unique designs is just better in my book.<br />
<br />
Animation is largely saved for the fight scenes which are fluid enough to warrant being noted.  Of course the CGI models for the fairies cut down on costs, but the fight choreography is good enough to warrant interest.  However it&#039;s not really anything special, especially given how a lot of the &#039;fight&#039; scenes involve guns and ducking behind cover, with only a few featuring the swords and fairy weapons showcased.<br />
<br />
As for the soundtrack, &quot;KNOCK on the CORE&quot; by (K)NoW_NAME is an OP that I&#039;ve grown to have interest in only for the background choir and the steady rock beat that it has to really push how the show is an action-packed adventure despite having &#039;Fairy&#039; in the title.  It&#039;s a nice song that&#039;s worth a listen to, but that&#039;s about all I can really credit it for since beyond that, I don&#039;t really find it memorable.  Similarly, its ED sister &quot;Ash-like Snow&quot; by the same artist is only interesting because of how it starts with the lead up of the piano before going into a song that largely feels generic despite how it starts.<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
I&#039;m just going to have to accept the fact that P.A. Works doesn&#039;t know the definition of &#039;follow through&#039;, now do I?  Like all P.A. Works shows, I was very, very, very, very, very, VERY skeptical on how Fairy Gone was gonna do.  The company only does original shows, and while the onset looked interesting, I was almost positive at the time of seeing this advertised that this was going to crash and burn somehow; I just didn&#039;t know how.<br />
<br />
Well, apparently it&#039;s by following in the steps of Angel Beats and Charlotte by making the narrative so absurdly complex through dumping in every idea you could think of for the plot and saying &#039;no&#039; to none of them.  I&#039;m honestly just tired having to write and say the same fucking thing for every P.A. Works, but they keep fucking doing it!  Now I don&#039;t hate Fairy Gone.  In fact, I actually find the show to be very interesting because of how many facets of this narrative they managed to cram in here.  But because all of them are half-assed in the way they are, I find it very hard to give the show any other positive qualities aside from maybe neat designs for the soldiers&#039; fairies.  It&#039;s just...disheartening, really disheartening to see the same cycle get repeated season after season, year after year.<br />
<br />
So ultimately I do not recommend this series.  I&#039;m still watching the second season just to know how it ends (and I&#039;ve signed a blood oath to watch everything P.A. makes henceforth), but I think for the casual/typical watcher, you&#039;re better off finding something else to watch.  A damn shame too cause a part of me was really looking forward to having something from this company to recommend to people aside from the usual three to four shows I found to be at least of decent quality.

    He&#039;s got the brawn. She&#039;s got the br- Wait no, she&#039;s basically just got a fairy.<br />
<br />
So the premise of this anime was interesting. It started out edgy, cool, strong. So you must be wondering &quot;But 88, if it&#039;s so strong, why did you give it a one?&quot; Well, let me tell you....<br />
<br />
You&#039;d think being an anime about military that the main male who is an ex-soldier from the war would y&#039;know, still have military tactic knowledge, right? Nope! He&#039;s all brawn and no brains. He just bull rushes everything. He&#039;s not even that strong on his own. His Fairy is what&#039;s strong. He&#039;s just weak.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313777">
        He uses the Fairy to be the mediocre strength. Add to that a completely forgettable name, face, etc. and well, you&#039;ve got nothing.<br />
<br />
Marlya has no training. Take away her gun, and she&#039;s just an ordinary girl. Oh, but even with her gun, she&#039;s still UTTERLY USELESS. Yep. At best, she is Civilian A, a mary sue, a shadow of a character. Blah blah blah. I mean, she can&#039;t fight, she spends more time being a damsel in distress and getting rescued than she did actually fighting/contributing. In short, she&#039;s just a place holder for.... what? I dunno, but something I guess.<br />
<br />
<br />
The story started out compelling. But you quickly realize that it&#039;s all a facade, and there&#039;s nothing really there, just shadows. Two useless characters in a story that has to be forced forward without any compelling reason, and it&#039;s just flat out boring, and the characters quickly become irritating. To be honest it was so bad, even giving any of it  a &#039;two&#039; feels generous.<br />
<br />
I would highly HIGHLY recommend skipping this series. This is not the dark action anime you are looking for.

    it&#039;s sad i can&#039;t enjoy this show more it just feels rushed<br />
<br />
the story and premise are good but that&#039;s not able to keep this boat afloat<br />
<br />
art is ok, industry standard &quot;we don&#039;t have enough budget to do this without poor 3d&quot; kinda art<br />
<br />
score is ok but alot of the tracks sound like dodgy bootleg songs from better anime,<br />
poorly fitting in with the scene most of the time, the monster noises are ok but i think they only have like 4 noises in the sound pool to choose from...<br />
<br />
characters range from ok to god awful, the main protagonist is some kind of self pity Mary sue

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310153">
        trope sitting around 90% while saying &quot;I can do this !!&quot; and gawking like an ostrich at all the other people fighting, and to top everyone else just feels like supporting cast. you develop no attachment to them and just don&#039;t care what happens<br />
<br />
i&#039;ve watched worse shows but the final note for this is that a rushed product feels like wasted potential even more so when you hear a second season got ok&#039;ed
