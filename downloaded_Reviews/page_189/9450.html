    This has to be one of the most disjointed, nonsensical, pointless anime I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through. After being delayed for two years, Sword Gai has finally graced our screens; spraying us with its lovingly shat out excrement. Now’s the time to grab an umbrella because no one will be spared from this epically bad dumpster fire.<br />
<br />
Bear with me please, this synopsis may be hard to understand because well, Sword Gai is total nonsense. <br />
In a setting that resembles modern day Japan (I still have no clue where or when), there are certain infamous swords so old that they inhabit souls.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274721">
        Once a person grabs hold of one of these swords, they fall under its control and become totally helpless to its beckoning for the wielder to give it blood. This is where we’re introduced to the supposed main character’s parents, his father is killed on the street by some random guy with one of these swords. Leaving his pregnant mother with the sword to swiftly avenge her husband, give birth to the main character Gai, and kill herself all in the same night. Now the holder is Gai because for some unknown reason she chose to leave the sword in the baby’s hands so he could be the next possessed one. He’s discovered by a priest/sword forger who raises Gai to become a forger alongside his daughter, the same age as him. The set-up is simple enough, right? Think again because this is far from the only plot-line we see in episode one alone.<br />
<br />
The first episode is made up of vaguely related vignettes about people with swords. There ’s not much cohesion to it but the action is somewhat entertaining. We’re introduced to the corporation known as Shoshidai that discovers a sacred sword, and they later cross paths with the actual protagonist. There are many other stories shown, but I after seeing dozens of vignettes I can barely remember any of them. And if you find yourself forgetting these little side stories in favor of the actual main plot then I wouldn’t blame you.<br />
<br />
A majority of the episodes are just a bunch of these random vignettes that feel like they were made totally separate from the main story. We see stories from the perspective of a wealthy treasure hunter (who eats her treasure for reasons), a pop idol because why not, and a hairdresser to name a few. At best the characters were forgettable (I literally can&#039;t remember some of them), but at worst they&#039;re malicious caricatures that adhere to alienating stereotypes. For example, the treasure hunter character is depicted as an overweight woman who gets multiple panning shots in a bikini with splotchy character art and with a purposefully toadlike face to make sure you are fully disgusted by her. I&#039;m not sure why it was necessary to depict the only overweight character in the show this way, but it comes off as confused misguided writing to the point it’s insulting. And it&#039;s not just her who gets this appalling treatment, almost all of the characters have such ridiculously unaware writing. There was really no one to tell them how bad this was?<br />
As if this show didn&#039;t leave enough of a bad taste already.<br />
<br />
All of the characters from the vignettes, whether insultingly portrayed or totally forgotten, were totally useless to the story. None of them matter to the main character’s story. It was like they were wasting the audiences time because the main story didn’t have enough content to keep us entertained and frankly it doesn’t!! The main character has the most generic and bland plot line in the show that it made me beg for the side stories to return because they are at least intruiging in how bad they are.<br />
<br />
Each vignette has the same sort of formula; a person is driven to kill someone through some horrible misfortune that befalls on them, they receive a sword randomly… and then they beat the living hell out of the people causing their problems! All of the vignettes (and the show overall) have a common theme of anger, each character is driven by raw fury, enraged even further by their sword. I want to believe that Sword Gai is trying to say something interesting about the connection between violence, weapons, and anger, but there’s no commentary part. What we get here is just a raw upsetting exploitation of an interesting theme for the sake of pointless violence. And this series has plenty of violence and gore that is meant to complement the edgy tone they’re aiming for.<br />
<br />
There are so many scenes in Sword Gai that make no sense for why they were placed where they were. We could be in a school at one moment, then jump to a random guy in the midst of a duel, then a little girl learning how to play the piano. All within a span of three minutes, because who cares if the viewer understands what’s going on, right? From time to time we get a minor explanation after a series of disjointed scenes settles down, but it’s never enough for us to fully understand what we just witnessed. This issue simply boils down to the poorly distributed 12 episode runtime of the story. A majority of the narrative issues could be alleviated if the series writer Toshiki Inoue shortened (or ideally removed) certain plotlines, and chose to further develop the more necessary ones. <br />
<br />
To add insult to injury, Sword Gai has dozens of buzzwords it mixes into the dialogue to ensure you definitely do not understand what is occurring. Busoma, Chrysalis, Shoshidai… the list goes on and on. And if you’re not actively keeping track of each word and what they mean then guess what… you’ll be just as lost as I was!! Even without these pointless buzzwords, the dialogue is still fucking abysmal. It so desperately wants to be dark and serious but it comes off as either mind-numbingly stiff, hilariously overdone, or just outright cringy.<br />
<br />
The visuals often fall into an all red color scheme with deep dark shadows (is that you Akame ga Kill?), plenty of blood, lots of angry people yelling at each other; it’s all so overdone. Sometimes the dialogue was so bad that I found it quite laughable, the most enjoyment I got from the show. I’d only recommend this show if you can ironically enjoy it’s how terrible and overbearingly edgy it is.<br />
<br />
If you weren’t losing your mind with confusion by those previous issues, then don’t worry because the director’s got you covered! There is no cohesion between the sequence of events between many scenes in Sword Gai. In one of the worst instances of this issue, we’re suddenly shown a montage of this random guy and his girlfriend together at an amusement park… but while I’m watching this play out I can only think, who are these people and why should I care!? There are way too many characters to be supported by such a purposefully disjointed plot! The ‘main’ character shows up from time to time to arbitrarily be a part of the sword fights. But the thing is, Gai is as interesting as a plank of wood for the entire series! So even with the protagonist present, there are no stakes to any of the fights. Maybe if Gai had more screen time we could have learned why he’s worth caring about rather than him getting the everyman character design and generic love interest to swoon over him. It feels like it&#039;d be fitting to say Sword Gai has plot holes, but it&#039;s hard to level that criticism at it when THE WHOLE PLOT IS A HOLE.<br />
<br />
What made the scenes with Gai bearable was his pairing with my favorite character Seiya. He’s like a diamond in the rough who stood head and shoulders above the rest of the cast. Simultaneously he adheres to the macho-asshole archetype but is surprisingly also a 100% certified nice guy. After being awoken from a sleep that lasted years, he returns to his now elderly wife and treats her with all of the same love and respect he would have before. This single brief vignette lasting only half an episode is without a doubt my favorite part of the show, sadly that is all he gets. Save for a few hilarious one-liners and his constant presence around the gloomy protagonist to provide some much needed levity. Sadly neither of them get much screen time due to the story&#039;s messy structure.<br />
<br />
I can at least praise the visuals for being decent. However, they’re nothing amazing, especially when comparing it to Production I.G.’s other recent release B: The Beginning. Character art is good but occasionally their animation is anything but. I didn’t particularly care for the CGI sword fights either. For a show that is billing itself as ‘the definitive sword guy anime’ it can’t even do sword fights right. B also has far better fight choreography with much more fluidity and impact. Sword Gai comes up with a stupid plot contrivance to make the characters fight each other in weird samurai/mech suits so that they can use CGI and it’s so obvious. As the rule goes, if you use your cursed sword for too long or something or other then it possesses you completely and you become trapped in one of those suits. Forced to fight in some really just mediocre fight sequences. Sound effects don’t line up perfectly with some of the blows a fighter takes during combat, nor do they have the audiovisual impact to convince us that the scene we’re watching is as dangerous as they want us to believe. <br />
<br />
This mediocrity extends into the totally forgettable soundtrack that fades into nothing when it’s present at all. As for the opening song, the less said the better because it’s awful. I’d love to analyze it and compare it to the main character’s arc, but the way the singer sounds makes my head want to explode. I did find the English dub good enough, the sub is equally decent, but remember… TERRIBLE DIALOGUE!! No amount of good acting can salvage a horrible script!<br />
<br />
Before closing, I should mention that there is no ending. The show ends on not even a cliffhanger, on just the same old ending of any other episode but without any others to follow it. The ending sets itself up for a sequel, even saying &quot;Part 1&quot; at the end, but there&#039;s almost no chance it will be any better given it was in production before the first even released. <br />
Whatever I’m sure as hell never coming back to this series if it gets a sequel or not.<br />
<br />
Score Breakdown:<br />
[Story: 1/10] Nonsensical, disjointed, forgettable, no ending.<br />
[Character: 2.5/10] Boring protagonist, one strong side character.<br />
[Art: 6/10] Serviceable art, so-so CGI, eye-catching use of color.<br />
[Sound: 5/10] Decent dub, forgettable music, sound effects lack impact.<br />
[Enjoyment: 2/10] Painfully serious at some times, laughably stupid at others.<br />
<br />
[Overall Score: 3.3/10]<br />
Sword Gai is a seething pile of angst and rage. It actively tries to make you feel the anger that all of its characters do, and it regrettably succeeded. If you&#039;ve come this far you surely know that Sword Gai made me angry. Mostly it was a waste of time, but I can at least say it&#039;s the special sort of bad that&#039;s easy to laugh at.<br />
<br />
If you want an outlandish action thriller then I&#039;d recommend you watch B: The Beginning rather than this. In fact, Sword Gai is the worst anime Netflix has released this year, it is an unsightly blemish on their otherwise strong lineup.

    So in case you&#039;re wondering, this is a Netflix series. One of the bunch that they have been spitting out since the beginning of 2018. I would honestly give this anime more of a 7.5 rather than a 7 but I don&#039;t want to give it an 8. Any &quot;spoilers&quot; I mention are either in the synopsis or you find out in the first episode. So there are demon swords (so...refreshing) and when a human combines with them they either turn into a demon or control it and use its power...sorta. The twist is that if you use the power too much then it will

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274716">
        consume you anyway. So it follows this kid who ends up getting one for an arm and the story sorta is....eh. The plot meanders because I think they were trying to build up all the characters to the same level of development, which for only 12 episodes is somewhat ambitious. I have to admit there were two instances where I actually felt something for the characters. The mc is supposed to be edgy, but he drifts more to just being a dick, which I can somewhat appreciate because at least he&#039;s not the &quot;hooray I have a new power, let&#039;s save the world from evil!&quot;. I think Netflix really wants to use cg in all their anime for some reason because it&#039;s in this, sparingly thank goodness, but it takes away from rather nice visuals. The most interesting part of this anime was the concept of the &quot;power&quot;. Besides that it was just ok. I don&#039;t remember any song that stood out. It was an easy 12 episodes to burn through. If you&#039;ve got some free time I&#039;d recommend it. the anime at the very least is enjoyable to watch.

    Netflix has come up with yet another original Anime.. Or wait... was it? I will begin with the MC who is dull, lifeless, pessimistic, and self centered. We hardly know anything about him other then he is an ass. This is the shows biggest issue. The show focuses so little on the MC you almost wonder if he was the MC or yet another random character. The MC is followed by the loving Sayaka the daughter of the MC&#039;s master who seems to hold some emotional attachment to the MC. Yet for some reason the MC chooses to blow this off because his problems are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274960">
        more important then at least showing gratitude for the family that literally saved his life.<br />
<br />
  This show is a giant cluster. It&#039;s numerous characters introduced(almost never lasting more then an a full episodes worth) make none of the characters memorable at all. Worse yet, other then the supporting characters like Ms. Sayaka we are left wondering who we should be rooting for. Most of the &quot;Characters&quot; in the show seem like they are added for filler, and don&#039;t add anything to what is supposed to be a story other then show a different killer. All of the characters are dull, cliche, and serve no real purpose. Add to this random organizations such as Shoshidai, Ghabi, ect. and your left wondering how this &quot;secret&quot; is even remotely private. We have full on military incursions on city streets. Random characters hacking and burning the cities residents and explosions galore. The Fights between characters are almost 40% CG and done poorly at that. They look surreal, and don&#039;t seem to move correctly based on the scenery.<br />
<br />
  Sword Gai is a poor attempt at an action anime. What is has in random senseless gore, and fights, is easily overlooked by its poor character outlines, shoddy animation, piss poor dialogue, and random characters being introduced non stop(none of which do anything for the plot).  While the ending leads me to believe this will be a 24 episode anime. I cant help but feel the show is irredeemably bad. I cannot fathom what it would take to make this show into even a meh of an anime.  <br />
<br />
  In my opinion if you want to watch anime Originals on Netflix you would be better served watching the likes of &quot;Knights of Sidonia&quot;, or &quot;B: The Beginning.&quot;  Neither will likely ever achieve any level of greatness but their stories are at least somewhat coherent. With characters that you can actually remember and empathize with.<br />
<br />

    No hard spoilers in this review however there are some references to objects and the aroma the story gives off; however no direct examples from the story are given nor do I give off the main Ideas of the plot.<br />
<br />
Story (4): Starts off very ambitiously with an amazing first episode to pull the watcher in; however this feeling does not last. Once episode 6 is reached the story becomes a droll. I simply could not get myself to understand or comprehend the gravity of the situation. I can&#039;t help but feel this is a result of &#039;jumping around&#039; the show could not decide what to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274715">
        focus on, it feels more like a scrap-book than a cohesive plot.<br />
<br />
Art (6): Sometimes the 3D animation can look slightly plastic. To add on the Mecha style futuristic &#039;Knights&#039; that are introduced feel out of place as the majority of background stories are from medieval to ancient times.<br />
<br />
Sound (4): I have no idea why but during dialogue voices can sound far away and never does the music to a fight scene make the fight feel more intense.<br />
<br />
Character (5): The main character receives the least time of all the characters in the series to be developed. Constantly jumping around as I referred to in story not only removes the main characters story arc from the spotlight, but also leaves you experiencing negligible emotion towards harm or danger facing characters you should care about.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (6): I have spoken of all these bad things but the reason enjoyment is fair and not horrendous is the adventure that is attempting to understand a story that deep down could be good if directing was done better. It has some good ideas but needs to fix pretty much everything else about it.<br />
<br />
Overall/Conclusion (5): If I had to summarize this series in one word it would be &quot;mediocre&quot;. This story could be good, it could have good arcs, but it falls short in the end leaving a bad taste in your mouth. Sort of like smelling an exceptionally looking prime New York Steak only to bite into it and discover it has been burnt to a crisp.

    Sword Gai: The Animation: Now this anime as others have pointed out is the worst of all the anime Netflix has released this year, but in my view i think it tried to show what humans look like when they are angry, scared and greedy.<br />
The story is not something out of the ordinary and it is simple to unterstand.<br />
The MC is a emo/loner type who wants to be alone etc, but we later find out that the reason for this is the sword-the darkness that follows him everywhere he goes and it kinda makes you feel sorry about him.<br />
<br />
I think that this anime would&#039;ve been

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274752">
        better if it had 20 or 24 episodes since the characters didnt get the development and the story barely progressed through the series.<br />
Overall: I think while the story and the characters are not that great the anime tried to show us how human are when they are cornered, depressed, obsessed, vengeful and weak. The meaning behind it is what it matters.<br />

    Ahhhh Let&#039;s do this spoiler-free. So.<br />
Sword Gai: The Animation. I was actually really excited for this. Was. After the amazing (in my opinion) B: The Beginning, I thought that maybe, just maybe, one of my favourite mangas would get a decent, cool-looking anime adaptation. Again, thought. Past tense. So, Let&#039;s get onto the review, and why i thought it was how it was or just myy opinion on the aspects that made the manga so good and why i liked it, while i look at what the anime did... wrong.<br />
<br />
Story: 3<br />
While it wasn&#039;t really easy to adapt a manga which had a bit of psychological

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275159">
        trauma and some inside-fights of what it meant to be a human etc. into an anime, it could&#039;ve been done better. I mean, WAY better. For me the story, written as it is in the anime, wasn&#039;t as thrilling OR enjoyable as it was in the manga. It&#039;s messy, filled with fillers and oh my god. How can you add a scene like they did in the first few episodes, and not explain it, like: why did it happen? Why did that character become like that?- the anime tries to make it clear what it is doing, but nah, if i didn&#039;t read the manga, i&#039;d be a bit lost.<br />
My score for this is 3<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
As much as the story&#039;s messy, the art is somewhat gorgeous? While the art-style isn&#039;t as good-looking in the anime as it is in the manga, i kinda enjoyed it? It doesn&#039;t look BAD. It&#039;s just a thing for me to get used to, really. Maybe if i didn&#039;t read manga that often, i&#039;d think it&#039;s better than i think it is now. The 3D WAS unecessary for me, but that&#039;s too, just my opinion. Otherwise it was good.<br />
I give it 7 because of this.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6<br />
I liked the OST, kinda. While it did set the atmosphere well, and the OP was cool too, i&#039;m thinking that some screams and voice-acting was just..... too much. I don&#039;t really know what else to say about it<br />
I gave this 6<br />
<br />
Character: 4<br />
Ugh..... Can i just..... Haaaah. How do i even say this out loud. They were cool, yea? Yea..... But they weren&#039;t just it. As much as i try to look at it... I miss the ball-thing Gai has in this hair. I miss HIS character over all. CHanging him, his story and all from the original...... in my opinion wasn&#039;t the best move. While i get why (maybe), i think the way it was here in the anime it&#039;s just a..... i don&#039;t know, meaningless? This applies to more characters<br />
My score for this is 4<br />
<br />
Enjoyment? 5<br />
I don&#039;t want to sugar-coat this series. Not at all. On 5th or 6th episode we finally got past 1st chapter/volume of the manga and can i just say? The director did not do a good job. I don&#039;t know.... I DID enjoy it to SOME extent, but not enough to get me yped for 2nd season, if there ever will be one. Yea. It ended up with a cliffhanger. That&#039;s it. God. xD idk anymore<br />
I gave this 5<br />
<br />
Overall: 5<br />
I felt like watching someone unsure of what he&#039;s doing. But, let&#039;s face it. Tell me how many anime did you see that were better than the manga. It&#039;s sad. I can only count less than fingers on my one hand. If you ever have the choice of choosing between the anime Sword Gai and the manga, i&#039;d without second of hesitation grab the manga. It&#039;s more pretty, Makes better sense. And it&#039;s. Good.<br />
<br />
SO i hope this wasn&#039;t just me blabbering about an anime that didn&#039;t really adapt the manga and rather was filled with spoilers and unnecessary scenes and stupidity. :&#039;) Have a nice day and sorry if you don&#039;t agree with me. It&#039;s just my point of view and opinion.

           For those who are hesitant on giving this anime a try and wanna watch only the pilot, here are my thoughts after watching the pilot. I&#039;ll also come back to edit this after I finish the show.<br />
<br />
       Oooooh my goood. Are the writers of this anime okay???? I know that this was adapted from a manga, but surely the manga can&#039;t be as bad right? First off, I will admit. The art is quite splendid. In just the first episode, we get a glimpse of how battles will be fought, and my,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review378524">
        do the opponents look cool. With all this being said, WTF is this structure.<br />
<br />
       The first episode alone, feels like someone threw the script into a blender and just didn&#039;t give a shit about rearranging the properly. What we get, is an incoherent mess, with characters doing random ass shit with no motivation. <br />
<br />
       It seems like the writers or director notice this problem, and just go &quot;Oh fuck! No one&#039;s gonna understand this bullshit! Quick, give him a line of dialogue so they&#039;ll at least get a grasp of the situation.&quot; THIS IS THE FIRST EPISODE GUYS!!! How tf do you fuck up a pilot so bad?? <br />
<br />
       Hah... Anyways, watch this if you&#039;re sad I guess, because this is laughably bad I&#039;d say. I&#039;ll still continue watching solely for the art, but this is definitely a shit-show of an anime.

Sword Gai The Animation (2018)<br />
<br />
Well, here we have a show that for the first time has left me wondering if I can do the second season. The show has some positives but the main character just ruins the entire experience. <br />
<br />
Story: Cursed weapons + humans with dark and/or sad emotions = possession. How quickly that possession takes over the person varies. <br />
<br />
Art: The art when it is normal like the people, vehicles, surroundings are very good. What is not good and brings it down completely is the Busoma being the people who have given into darkness are absolutely awful. They are seriously out of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330878">
        place and clunky. They just do not fit right at all. <br />
<br />
Sound: Is fair but nothing too special. Soundtracks are good enough. <br />
<br />
Characters: Most of them are dull, boring and just give you no desire to know them. <br />
<br />
Some of the supporting ones like the girlfriend of Seiya Ichijou are just puzzling. You get thrown in at the deep end with a woman that has lost it that provides no real basis for why they included her for any of it since she has no depth. <br />
<br />
Midoriko the idol girl is at least a cute girl with a sadistic side that you can get on with. She is actually a fairly likeable character compared to the others. <br />
<br />
Sayaka again is likeable. She is pretty closed off with her clear feelings for Gai from the world but she is at least satisfying to see do things. <br />
<br />
The issue in the show and one that ruined the entire experience for me if I am honest is Gai Ogata. He is boring, dull, uneventful, a hollow representation of the main character. He is also unnecessarily selfish. Yes, I do appreciate he had a hard time around when he was born. BUT he grew up in a loving home with a girl like Sayaka who loved him dearly. But what do we get??? a guy who acts like he is alone, that has always been alone and doesn&#039;t have anywhere he belongs. It is so far from the truth in the attempt to make him a dark protagonist who may redeem the light in his heart at a later date type character that it is done so badly that it just ruined the show. If Gai wasn&#039;t in it or he was constructed differently it could have more of a redeeming storyline. <br />
<br />
The show was overall in enjoyment pretty mediocre. It was ok in the fight scenes. The slice of life side was actually better overall, which is bad because it is not a slice of life anime. <br />
<br />
In the end, I shall persevere and watch season 2. More because I want to see what happens with Sayaka and Midoriko. Also, Himiko seems to be interesting too. I leave this one as a wide-open choice to whether you want to watch it, I struggle myself to believe I got through it but I always finish things I start so. <br />

    This show is average to downright bad in looks. The story is boring and hard to follow. The music is forgettable. And, I didn&#039;t enjoy this, as evidenced by my never finishing it.<br />
<br />
The art has this ugly muted color palette. Yeah, sure, it was going for some &quot;dark and gritty&quot; stuff, but the animation was so lackluster that it didn&#039;t work. They try to go for some &quot;popping&quot; scenes, but it uses these all red color palettes, and stays like that for far too long. There were some interesting colors with the weapons, I guess.<br />
<br />
The dub is just... bad. <br />
<br />
There was this guy who worked

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277240">
        in the same place as Gai that was extremely predictable and annoying. You will know if you watch the show.<br />
<br />
Overall, I didn&#039;t enjoy this show at all. They try to go for super edgy; and yes, they got super edgy. Do I like &quot;super edgy&quot;? No.

    The story is complete garbage, I&#039;m watching it at 4x speed and I still found it slow and dreadful. Some things don&#039;t even make sense, like a sword-smith reforging a sword into a mechanical arm for a boy? How in the world does a sword-smith have the skills to forge a mechanical arm and have the medical knowledge to attach it to a person? But whatever, I&#039;ll let that plot-hole slide to ask why the boy needs to have a mechanical arm in the first place. It actually doesn&#039;t seem to play a role in the story at all. I can tell that the anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275227">
        wants to have a second season and was gearing the anime towards it with the introduction of new characters and developments towards the latter half of the series. The &#039;ancient and old&#039; japanese folk music in the openings and endings were mediocre and I felt like it didn&#039;t fit in the story at all. There were characters who showed up for a scene and was never mentioned again, organizations that were mentioned and seemed to be a world-power of sorts but never developed, and characters that basically stayed the same throughout the entire series [Gai]. The only good thing about it was the art and animation, the fights were meh, not enough to draw me into the story. It was basically a few clashes here and there, nothing cool at all. I felt like the backstory of the swords were basically filler and in terms of story, nothing really happened. Good guy turns bad, MC has a &#039;sword&#039; and joins organization, fights against bad guy. I get that they were trying to do some dynamic parallelism with non-violence and violence at the end but that seemed to happen way too late.

    tl;dr <br />
<br />
- ntr (sorta) and other unpleasant things - if you&#039;re looking for a badass kirito protagonist you&#039;re in the wrong place<br />
- an extended PV with tones of (decent, imo) sub-plot<br />
- you won&#039;t enjoy this unless you&#039;re ok with durararara!! style shows<br />
- female audiences would perhaps enjoy this more<br />
<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
Watched everything at a go and to be honest... it felt like a 12 episode PV to something way longer. I.e. it was a start to something really great, we&#039;ve got the actors and premise all set up, but it had to end mid way leaving me hanging and... looking for the manga.<br />
<br />
First things first, I did

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274956">
        not read the manga before finishing the show. Took a peek at the first chapter - a LOT of things are different (including how the MC is born, basic character design etc) so check it out yourself if you&#039;re curious.<br />
<br />
Next comes the complaint about this show being supper fragmented with stupid buzzwords... interestingly I don&#039;t find it problematic at all. Maybe it&#039;s because I&#039;ve sat through stuff like Occultic;9, Durararara!! and most recently hakata tonkutsu ramens so am used to pausing and processing if things go way too fast. <br />
<br />
As for scene switching, I find that it ranges from beautifully executed to show a contrast between normalcy and violence (though to be honest fighting scenes were a big MEH) to serving no real purpose, but the story is still easy enough to follow. There is a big cast to fit into 12 episodes, so character development is limited, but certain characters such as Ichijo, Mika, and Marcus are portrayed pretty well and distinctly; everyone had a believable (by anime standards) motive and really-cliche-cliches were somewhat avoided. <br />
<br />
To be honest this feels like K, but with better pacing and a more promising ending. Conversations are, especially in the first few episodes, awkward at times, but does not affect overall enjoyment of the show. The main character feels like 3 different people in 3 different stages, but he&#039;s more like a plot device/narrator for the audience to focus on and functions pretty well in that position.<br />
<br />
Overall, it feels like there&#039;s a lot of wasted potential when it comes to execution - be it the poorly written dialogue, the unimpressive soundtrack, or sub-par CGI fighting. The plot is nonetheless interesting and some episodes brought me close to tears, so I&#039;ll be looking forward to the next installments.

    alright, I&#039;ve been putting this review off for a while for the simple reason anything I could say has likely been said at this point, however that&#039;s a very weak reason not to do something. With that out of the way let&#039;s begin with the story<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
I honestly think the story is by far the weakest aspect of this anime. In it&#039;s essence, each episode has a focus character and the episodes tends to follow them and the events that unfold. Due to this Gai, being the titular character, does not actually take up a lot of screen time through out the series. Normally this would

          <span style="display: none;" id="review278936">
        be fine if the cast is compelling or the side plot is relevant but neither is the case. Each character they try to develop is bland and their stories are either extremely underdeveloped or horribly clichéd. It gets the point where the story gives you no real reason to care about the cast or their motivations, just presents it and expects you to care. Not to mention the horribly unsatisfying ending that purely is meant to bait the sequel and doesn&#039;t do anything at all to actually tie things up. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art: hmmmm, i&#039;m torn, the character art isn&#039;t actually bad in any sense of the word but the horrible mismanagement of CGI completely pulls you away from fight scenes. Honestly if there was an animation section i&#039;d just pull points from there but since I consider art and animation to be separate I decided to give it a 6. (although the reused transformation scene got tired really quick)<br />
<br />
Sound: decent soundtrack, nothing out of this world, but it worked. honestly I can&#039;t remember any particular songs so great that I felt compelled to find them on youtube, nor did I find them to be off putting. probably the most average piece of the anime tbh.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: wew, man, what can I say about these characters. I&#039;d say two, two of them are potentially intereting, of those two, one has a slight backstory explained, and he never gets good screen time afterwards. The rest of the cast, laughably flat and horribly developed. Character motivations are never fully fleshed out, and you just see people doing shit but you never get why. And if you do get a why, it&#039;s a disgustingly basic why. It&#039;s like they expected the cursed weapon trope to give them a pass on mindless villians. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I went in with the expectation it would be a decent seasonal, i was horribly wrong and despite my attempts to turn my brain off, little by little I became aware of the cracks in the show and by the time I reached the end I couldn&#039;t but ask myself &quot;why am I watching this?&quot;. Should have cut my loses at episode 6 but whatever. <br />
<br />
<br />
I highly recommend you don&#039;t watch this, honestly i was suprised how bad this was compared to the other show I.G worked on.<br />
<br />
<br />
3/10<br />

    Sword Gai is About a Guy Named Gai With a Sword Fighting Other Guys With Swords...<br />
<br />
Ohhhh man, somebody tell me if this show ever conceives a single original concept to throw into the mix, but I could barely withstand the sheer onslaught of anime cliches that were catapulted into my eyes by, possibly the most lazily named show of all time Sword Gai, after episode 2. Sure, it&#039;s nice that Netflix is still going hard in the paint on their &quot;original&quot; anime funding, even though this pales in comparison to their work on B: The Beginning and Devilman Crybaby, but they really need to pay

          <span style="display: none;" id="review286198">
        their writers as much as their animators when it comes to these shows because it seriously seems like the concept came from a brainstorming session that sounded something like &quot;what does everyone like about every anime ever? Let&#039;s throw it in there and hope it&#039;s not a complete mess!&quot;<br />
<br />
Story: 3<br />
Sword Gai is about a guy named Gai who is essentially Sasuke from Naruto but not (Natsuke?) and was born in literally the exact same way as Guts from Berserk and also loses and replaces the same arm as Guts (Gaits?). Gatsuke works as an apprentice to his adopted pops, an old school fire forging blacksmith in a story that is somehow set in the modern day with (of course) annoying high school kids, because every anime ever needs to have something to do with high school, right? The story contains enough equal amounts of cringe and edge to supply a national chainsaw juggling competition and had some serious issues trying to decide exactly who and what it wanted to focus on, instead opting to show countless underwhelming side stories and occasionally remembering to check back with the titular character of the series, Gai.<br />
<br />
Animation: 7<br />
This show contains a multitude of comically drawn-out firehose blood spurts that would put most B-Movies to shame and some generally great-looking overall animation when in 2D form. However, the jump to 3D, as is often the case, is where the problems start, like in the first 3D fight of the series which was literally two tiny Megazords grinding their swords together angrily for 15 seconds until one pushed the other into a wall so hard he decided to take a nap. The animators also seem to have a hard time grasping the concept of distance, because in the first episode a squad of about 6 soldiers UNLOAD every clip in their pistols on a guy with a sword standing still like 4 feet away from them only to somehow graze his face once and then knock his glasses off with a BULLET but not hit him in the head, it was honestly so stupid I wanted to smack someone involved in the making of it.<br />
<br />
Well, if this show gets any better at some point I might come back to it, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;ll happen for quite some time, so for the time being Sword Buddy Pal Friend Guy gets a disappointing 4 outta 10 from me.

    The main issue I see with this anime - one which could have easily been fixed - is the lack of a good protagonist. By the very nature of the premise, every protagonist is doomed to becoming unlikable and later an antagonist. As the anime goes on they become less and less sympathetic. No protagonist has a meaningful arc. Most side-characters were one-dimensional and boring. Some side-characters who were initially interesting were killed off or ruined by a newly introduced aspect of their personality. There were some genuinely likable side-characters, but they didn&#039;t get much screen time.<br />
<br />
The message that this anime attempts to convey is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285379">
        muddled (I suspect it has something to do with having people who support you). However, due to the limited success of characters in the anime it&#039;s difficult to tell. It paints a grim picture in which most people are not only doomed to fail, but the vast majority of the time it&#039;s impossible to save them. The overall result is that the world was irreversibly and negatively affected, something which is not at all congruent with reality.<br />
<br />
The various twists in the plot felt like they were there only for the sake of having twists (&quot;subverting expectations&quot;). None of them had much of a payoff; characters associated with those twists became less interesting as a result.<br />
<br />
Lastly, there are many unresolved questions (mostly dealing with the magic system associated with this anime) after what feels like the final episode of the series. it is unknown why certain things happened besides &quot;the plot needed them to happen.&quot; The ending felt unsatisfying due to what felt like a Deus ex Machina.<br />
<br />
Watching this is an exercise in frustration. Regardless of how much you may like the premise, I&#039;d wholeheartedly recommend skipping this one.

    This Anime, just.. oh boy. After waiting through the first 4 episodes for anything more than some boring descriptions of demon swords I still found no reason to continue watching other than the fact that I sir, am no quitter. I have watched every anime that I have started fully, and I plan to keep my bragging rights.<br />
There is little to no lore in the entire anime, and it severely lacks character development.<br />
<br />
Props to Netflix for writing a tiny description that interested me enough to add it to my list. Though my dearest regrets for actually watching every episode.<br />
<br />
(There are now spoilers after this point

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285976">
        forward. You have been warned)<br />
<br />
The main character, Gai, has absolutely no character development. Other than the fact that he&#039;s seen in every episode, there is no real reason to call him the main character. The only background is that his family was troubled by the demon sword Shiryu, and Gai is just a complete jerk to everyone.<br />
<br />
After watching episodes 1-3 and finding nothing intriguing at all, the only real reason I kept watching was because I had nothing better to do at the time.<br />
<br />
I wish I could say that the anime picks up at a point and is worth watching: It&#039;s not.<br />
<br />
Though if lacking on your knowledge of ancient fictional demon swords, definitely hit this anime up. You&#039;ll learn a lot of pointless information that takes up almost half of every episode.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t even get started on how Shin replaces Gai in season 2 after he supposedly kills himself.<br />
<br />
Cliché after Cliché about everything.<br />
Main character is an arrogant jerk-Check, A girl loves him that he does not love back-Check, He&#039;s completely overpowered and cannot die-Check, Oops he turned up dead but actually is still alive!-Check.<br />
<br />
But also more proof as to the lack of lore here. When Shin replaced Gai, I actually cared for him more than Gai, and Gai is supposed to be the main character!<br />
<br />
Part of me wished Gai would just disappear and let Shin have the spotlight because he had better background information and had a reason to be there. Though I still don&#039;t get the full idea of who everyone is? And yes, I finished the entire anime.<br />
<br />
Point being, SwordGai begain its onslaught of disappointment at the title. Haha- puns aren&#039;t funny anymore, sorry to disappoint. I was actually angry at that.<br />
<br />
Then I wanted to throw my laptop out the window for how rediculous everything else was. Nothing pleased me except the part where Shin&#039;s sister Rei survived.<br />
<br />
She didn&#039;t deserve what she&#039;d gone through, but frankly neither did I with this anime.<br />
<br />
A disappointed viewer (Other than the art style, good job on that one)<br />

    This is just so boring. Characters are weak, nothing to really care about if they live or die. The story is just so horribly told and the episodes don&#039;t have any real continuity. I dropped it because it was boring at episode 5 then picked it up and watched til episode 7 and I was done. I could careless what happens as I&#039;m not attached to any of them. The art is good, the fight scenes are kind of meh. The voice acting is decent but it seems that any of the voice actors were just there to get a paycheck as they didn&#039;t seem

    I&#039;m giving Swordgai a 5, but it fills a niche that&#039;s hard to come by. It revolves around tragedy and drama. And it&#039;s good at tragedy when it stays on target. Unfortunately, it gets extremely cluttered due to poor direction and some plot elements that never go anywhere. A few characters so up out of nowhere. Additionally, the art is stiff for the most part.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for a tragic drama, it will do it if you don&#039;t have anything else. Also you can watch it in dub, so that&#039;s a plus. If you&#039;re really intent on the concept, the manga is complete and probably

    My overall rating is  a 6 for this anime. <br />
Why did i go all the way till the end with this one? simple. <br />
<br />
SEIYA ICHIJO<br />
<br />
the art is beautiful but the graphics is poor. the MC is so bad that i cared little for him and that sayaka was as stupid as she looked like misa amane. The sword backstories were one other good thing in the story. As for character development, there was not any. <br />
I expected a lot and got very little. The Mc resembles sasuke a little too much. And that was the downfall. To top it the somewhat interesting characters like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review276314">
        that hairdresser or that hatsune miku look alike got sidelined and we ended up with the lame ass gai. Matoba who looks like a less insane and almost similar in respects kaneki and his speech is probably the worst space ever taken by a scene. Now that i have established that most chara resemble some chara from some anime, let me touch upon the actual plot; what was it again?<br />
<br />
to my own surprise i watched the show. but i was fully engaged though. so not all is lost.
