    This is by far the anime medium&#039;s magnum opus. Mars of Destruction is the best animated movie I&#039;ve seen in years, if not ever. In terms of science-fiction related media, this blows other greats such as Heinlein&#039;s works, Battlestar Galactica, and Neon Genesis Evangelion out of the water. Truly an experience I will never forget, and oh, what an experience it was!<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
This film is highly philosophical. I actually felt regret when the Big Bad Ancient Guy told Random Armored Cop Dude that the humans were the true invaders of Earth. This plot twist was stunning and, on the whole, thought-provoking. It was like something

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21877">
        written by Kafka.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation: 10/10<br />
This movie is so amazing that it actually makes DEEN&#039;s animation look like Madhouse by comparison. It gave me more appreciation for other anime titles! I love you, Mars Of Destruction!!!<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
The voice acting is absolutely perfect. When the characters yell each other&#039;s names repeatedly you will FEEL the emotion. The OST recorded by Beethoven himself is also marvelous. He did an excellent job, as always.<br />
<br />
Characters: 10/10<br />
The characters are all equally well-done, from Green Hair Girl to Blue Hair Girl; it&#039;s so easy to tell them apart! I especially enjoyed the doctor&#039;s dialogue, as I would not have known that the girl whose head exploded was dead without his helpful reminder that &quot;she won&#039;t make it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
This picture is absolutely riveting on every level! I could watch it over and over and never get bored!<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />

    After watching this, I just felt that I simply HAVE to write a review for this masterpiece. Why is this a masterpiece, you ask? Simple, because it&#039;s the only Sci-fi/Horror anime which ever made me laugh so hard.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story... Wait, what was the story again? Apart from whatever that was said in the synopsis, there is pratically no storyline at all, it&#039;s just about a bunch of girls working for the police fighting off the &#039;Ancients&#039; alongside a guy who was forced to wear a suit developed by his father to fight the &#039;Ancients&#039;, and how much killings they saw on the way while delivering

          <span style="display: none;" id="review11750">
        the bits from the wrecked Mars exploration ship to America, and how they eventually found out that Martians were Earthlings and Earthlings were Martians. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art is simply amazing. It&#039;s old for a 2005 anime, and the animation is just so stiff. I think even 1980s anime/OVAs like Gunbuster and Mobile Suit Gundam has better art and animation than this. The only saving grace is how bloody the massacres were.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The voice acting was horrible. The only thing I found nice to hear were the moanings of dying people, and the growling of the &#039;Ancients&#039;. And as for the music, I could&#039;ve sworn I heard a few classical pieces in the background.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
It would be difficult to identify the characters if not for them having different genders and looks, for there is no distinct characteristics for the different character. The only distinctive traits the characters ever have are their looks and their voices. They might as well make every single character look and sound the same, since it would save them the trouble from having to think of how each and every character would have to look and sound.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
This is where this OVA shines. The enjoyment factor. As I&#039;ve said before, never has any sci-fi/horror series made me laugh as hard as this did. I laughed when the ship at the beginning blew up, I laughed when the girls were so stupid that they stood still and didn&#039;t run as the &#039;Ancients&#039; charged up and fired their beam at them, I laughed when one of the girls got her head blown off, I laughed when the policeman was torn apart, I laughed when the main dude in the suit didn&#039;t know how to use his other free hand to attack the main &#039;Ancient&#039; when his sword arm was stopped, and then later broken and dislocated by the &#039;Ancient&#039;, I laughed when the professor in the US said that the DNA found on Mars belonged to Homo Sapiens, I laughed when the &#039;Ancient&#039; began to speak, I laughed when he said that Earthlings were Martians, and Martians were Earthlings. I was laughing throughout the entire show.<br />
<br />
So overall, all I have to say is, if you&#039;ve got about 20 minutes of your life you would like to waste away, please, PLEASE, do catch Mars of Destruction. :D

    [Death of an Anime Viewer]<br />
<br />
Ivan was your average, everyday, normal viewer, he had just finished his latest anime series, and was searching for a new one to watch.  While, reading the reviews of several shows on MAL, he came across the infamous Mars of Destruction.<br />
<br />
He had heard many horrible stories, regarding this particular animation. He read the reviews and noticed that many people called it &quot;the worst anime ever.” <br />
<br />
He thought to himself, “This can’t possibly be true. Even the worst anime has one redeeming feature. I have to see this for myself.”<br />
<br />
He immediately typed in the words “Mars of Destruction” in Google and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review189996">
        found a video of it on Youtube. He clicked the video and it began to play. <br />
<br />
Little did Ivan know that clicking and playing the video would be the biggest mistake in his entire life.<br />
<br />
As soon as the video started, he noticed the shoddy animation/art such as, the lack of facial expression on the characters, the awful character designs, the camera shaking, and the undistinguishable characters.<br />
<br />
The sound was uneven some parts being loud and some being soft, the Beethoven music felt out of place and distracted him from the fight scene, and the voice acting was subpar.<br />
<br />
The story was filled with many unanswered questions, like why did these ‘Ancients’ attack, who developed AAST, who is Takeru’s father, why choose Takeru of all people, why do the girls seem ill-trained for combat, why use shitty weapons against the aliens, etc.  The questions were endless.<br />
<br />
And, all the characters were undeveloped, their intelligences level were equivalent to that of a rock, their emotional levels were nil and their dialogues were laughable, especially when the doctor stated that the headless girl wasn’t going to survive. No shit, doctor!  No shit!<br />
<br />
Once, the video was over, Ivan’s eyes were closed and his ears were covered with his palms. He tried to not remember the horrible anime, but it was too late.<br />
<br />
His brain began to recall the shitty characters, the shitty animation, the shitty story and the shitty sound. He could feel his brain melting, it was slowly turning into a puddle of slush.  Suddenly, the slush oozed out of his ears and nose, and trickled to the floor. He felt the slush in his hands and on his face. Then, immediately, he lost all feeling in his arms and legs, and fell to the floor.<br />
<br />
He was dying, albeit slowly.  At first, he panicked, but soon realized that it was better to die than be tortured by the images and sounds of Mars of Destruction.<br />
<br />
He thought to himself, “Damn! There really was no redeeming feature in that show.  That truly was the worst anime ever!  The world needs to know of my fate!”<br />
<br />
He went onto MAL and wrote a short review, and then submitted it.<br />
<br />
Afterwards, he died, but before he passed away, he hoped that somebody had read his warning review; a warning, for those who are curious, that Mar of Destruction will literally melt your brain.<br />
<br />
The End

    Today I had the sudden inspiration to write a review on the unfathomably glorious and unparalleled masterpiece that is Mars of Destruction. Here is a breakdown of why Mars of Destruction is THE most epic anime ever created. <br />
<br />
Plot<br />
The story is one of the best I have ever seen. Martians invading the Earth for absolutely no properly explained reason? Wonderful! The main protagonist, Takeru, having to fight these creatures and endure the pain brought about by the mars suit which he wears? So dramatic! And the female characters are part of a well designed special alien fighting group called the AAST with Takeru, and they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review167327">
        all have their very own unique skill that they never use because they are always seen with the same exact gun. Now the best part is the climatic battle scene against the alien leader. Just seeing Takeru&#039;s arm being broken after 5 seconds of fighting was so painful to watch! The girls valiantly tried to stop the alien, but they just couldn&#039;t handle his special ability &quot;death grip&quot;, which is him basically grabbing the girls&#039; necks and choking them without doing ANYTHING else. I shouted for joy when, after having a 3 minute conversation with a green haired girl while his other companions were getting choked to death by the alien, Takeru used some random untested weapon that was randomly given to him by the random green haired girl to blow a hole through the alien who SAW Takeru about to shoot him but didn&#039;t move at all. At the very end, the plot takes a psychological turn when it is discovered that the Martians are the earthlings and the earthlings are the martians. ;o; Shocking, I know. It&#039;s just so amazing how fantastic the plot is of this 20 minute show!<br />
<br />
Art<br />
My eyes frickin MELTED from the exquisite animation of this show. You may not believe it, but the female characters, who had the same exact faces, outfits, and figure, actually had different colored hair, which all had their own unique design. The alien leader looked different from the other aliens, which I believe helps emphasize his superior character. The fight scenes, oh my God the fight scenes were animated BRILLIANTLY! Especially the one between Takeru and the alien leader, it was such a powerful battle, and it brought forth numerous emotions, especially when they stood staring at each other while doing absolutely nothing for five minutes. The art in this show is just gorgeous. <br />
<br />
Sound<br />
This show had no opening or ending theme, but that&#039;s okay! The insert songs were more than enough for my ears to listen to. My personal favorite was when, during the climatic battle between our heroic protagonist and his dastardly foe, a piece written by Beethoven plays in the background. Thats right, this show has the budget to insert one of Beethoven&#039;s classical arrangements into the anime. It&#039;s just so amazing!<br />
<br />
Characters <br />
Mars of Destruction has some of the most interesting and dynamic characters that I&#039;ve even seen. They even go as far as to name each and every one of the four female leads. The backstory of the protagonist Takeru was one of the most emotional moments of anything ever created. It was gut wrenching when his dad forced him to wear the mars suit. Oh, the feels! I also find it necessary to point out my personal favorite character, known only as the girl from AAST. In the very first battle, she valiantly stood firm against the alien aggressors, and never moved from her position. My jaw dropped in shock as an alien shot a beam of light or something from his mouth and it blew off the head of the AAST girl. I cried when, in the hospital, the doctors deduced that she was dead after thoroughly analyzing her headless body. I sincerely hoped that she would survive, but alas, it was not meant to be. She died a true hero. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment <br />
If you don&#039;t find this show entertaining, then I don&#039;t know what else could possibly satisfy you. Everything about this show screams perfection, from the fantastic plot right down to the music by Beethoven. My eyes were glued to the screen for the entirety of the 20 minutes in which this show ran, and it was possibly the greatest 20 minutes of my life. Thank you Idea Factory for providing the world with this exceptional anime!

    This anime is...not very good. In fact...it&#039;s sculpted out of shit. The only reason somebody could ever watch this show is because it is the most lowest rated peice of trash on MAL. Heck, that was actually the reason I watched it.<br />
<br />
Story: Well, I&#039;ve seen powerpoint presentations that had more plot than this anime. Even a video of someone playing tetris may very well have more plot. Unfortunately for this anime, its &quot;plot&quot; was the best thing about it.<br />
<br />
Art: Seems as though the developers took every single opportunity they had to NOT move the characters...not move anything in fact. The beginning credits seem good as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review11883">
        they come in and then you realise that they just disappeared. No fade. No nothing. Complete crap. You&#039;d think that the developers could have at least not screwed up the opening credits. But no...they did.<br />
<br />
Sound: Classical music? Right. At least they could have picked the right music, but no, they picked music during the combat that made it seem like the main character (wait, there are characters in this?) was dancing with the alien. Completely out of place music, none of which was made by the developers of this anime. All free stuff that can be downloaded off the net. This anime brings shame to this music.<br />
<br />
Characters: Lol.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Well, no matter how sad of an excuse this is for an anime, it still has some good points, such as...wait, no it doesn&#039;t. Also, you&#039;d think that this anime is worth watching just to laugh at how bad it is, but it&#039;s actually worse than that. There is nothing to laugh at except when some random girl gets her head blown off. In fact, that is the only reason I am giving this an enjoyment rating of 4.<br />
<br />
Overall: Completely terrible anime. Only anime that is worse than this shit is Girls Bravo with english dub.

    This anime seems very bad on the surface. Blood shows up as a solid red substance that explodes into a pillar out of a character’s neckhole. This anime has that dumb shaky camera thing that was used in the movie Cloverfield, except nobody is filming this, so what the fuck? It’s not just the camera thing, characters look like they’re vibrating whenever they try to walk or move any part of their body. One possible explanation that I came up with is this: in the futuristic world of this anime everyone has seizures when they try to move. This is probably due to inbreeding that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review104695">
        was most likely caused by incest anime. That’s legit societal commentary right there.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Characters are all nameless and have no personality to speak of. They are so dumb that they need a doctor to tell them that decapitation is often fatal. They are so useless that even a training montage cannot save them from destruction. They are experts who suck at everything, including life. They are masters of various fighting styles, but they couldn’t hit an elephant’s ass from three centimeters away. Their faces are completely identical, but luckily their hair makes it kind of easy to tell them apart. Just kind of. The voice acting consists of lines read monotonously, pointless growls, or uninspired squeals, and is generally pointless. We don’t care about these characters. They don’t care about each other. They have absolutely no reaction when their friend’s head is blown off. They don’t even try to avoid their own deaths. They just kinda stand there.Hell, most fight scenes were just people standing in one spot and making noises at each other. The plot made zero sense and had no logic to it at all. Classical music was misplaced and used in the least fitting way possible. It was actually impressive how badly placed it was. In fact, you could try to make something worse than this anime, but you would almost invariably fail. So why am I not giving it a 1? <br />
<br />
<br />
Because I liked it. Why? Well, I could justify it in a lot of different ways. If you see me in a museum I’ll probably be that one douche who always pretends to understand the abstract art. I could say that this anime is brutally nihilistic à la Blood Meridian. I could say that the guns are phallic symbols and the whole anime is a Freudian commentary on the feminist movement. I could say it was a brilliant parody of “teenagers defend the earth” anime like Neon Genesis Evangelion, or of anime like Lain that have convoluted and hard to understand sci fi plots, and then I could lambast detractors as superficial for criticizing the audiovisuals of such a brilliant and philosophical masterwork. But that would all be unnecessary bullshit (although the anime was very arguably an NGE parody) because it was funny regardless. I laughed the whole way through. That automatically gives this anime more value than the vast majority of anime or manga that I have experienced. I don’t really care if the humor was intentional or not. The viewer’s interpretation overrules the creator’s intent. I watched it as a comedy; I hereby declare it a comedy. It’s impossible to take seriously anyway. In a measure of laughs per second it could go laugh for laugh with any other comedy anime I have ever seen and always come out on top. A comedy anime only really needs to be funny to be good, although effective satire could always help boost its score. This anime might not be deep, it might have shit audiovisuals, but it was very very funny. My stomach hurts from laughing. That is all.<br />

    &quot;Give me back my precious 19 minutes that I&#039;ve wasted!&quot;<br />
<br />
Wow, talk about low quality production. I hate to rate a show badly but I feel the scores I gave it is justified. Actually, this OVA does not even deserve to be reviewed (I end up wasting a lot more minutes typing this than the 19 minutes for the show). However, just so that hopefully no one else will suffer what I suffered, I&#039;ll write down my sincere thoughts about this anime only known as Mars of Destruction.<br />
<br />
At first, the synopsis reminded me of the epic PC game series known as &quot;Doom&quot;. Monsters from Mars... invasion

          <span style="display: none;" id="review12191">
        of Earth... some hero-wanna-be fight for Earth...etc. I am impressed how well the synopsis sums up the ENTIRE show.<br />
<br />
I believe every story has a moral message and Mars of Destruction, while being terrible in almost every single category, also has its own theme. In a very indirect/lame way, the show (I think) is trying to say something along the line of human (ie. us) is invading/killing Earth. Perhaps the author also believes that if we don&#039;t take care of Earth, someday aliens will come and get rid of the parasites on Earth (*shrug* That&#039;s just my take at the moral behind the story).<br />
<br />
For a 2005 piece of work, the animation and sound are mediocre at best. Sluggish character movements plus choppy low quality sound effects. Actually, the only music in the anime sound like those taken straight out of some 90s demo game. The producer, Idea Factory, certainly has no idea what it is producing.<br />
<br />
The most pathetic part about Mars of Destruction lies in the characters. The main characters, being the &quot;elite&quot; of the police forces, are extremely clumsy and slow reacting. Not sure if the problem lies with the story or the way things are animated, but either way, the problem is just so glaringly obvious (with the characters) that they are enough to completely distract the viewers from the story itself.<br />
<br />
I wish I can go back in time and tell me past self to spend those 19 minutes more wisely. I hope no one will make the same terrible mistake as I did. Stay away from this!

    Presenting a Phantomhive review of [Mars of Destruction] for your reading pleasure.<br />
<br />
Story (1): The Story is short and concise yet packs a powerful punch to the gut, quite literally one feels like they were punched by a horse after watching it. It is so simple to understand that even a 3 year old child can magically learn the phrase: &quot;Stop torturing me!&quot;; perhaps the greatest means to control a child in the modern age where it is now socially frown upon to whip a child.<br />
<br />
Art (1): The art is on a whole new level, it gives us all an appreciation of how difficult it is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review117551">
        to be colour blind because the characters are not differentiable, as the only means to tell several of the characters apart is by their hair colours. Such modern art most certainly sets this anime apart from all other anime due to other anime having distinguishable characters.<br />
<br />
Sound (1): The sound of this anime is simply remarkable, I am so impressed by this aspect of Mars of Destruction the most. At long last, an anime creator finally has the wisdom to learn from our elders or in this case, steal music from Beethoven. Our modern society definitely should heed this trend, a return to the musical greatness that was a part of society during the era of His Majesty King George III. No one can deny the fact that fighting during the War of 1812 would have been far better had Andrew Jackson been listening to Beethoven during combat; that is precisely what you get in Mars of Destruction, eardrum-destroying combat with classical music.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (1): The Enjoyment/Entertainment value of this Anime is unlimited. Nothing is more humourous or enjoyable than convincing your friends to watch Mars of Destruction only to have them become your source of entertainment. The potential is there for Mars of Destruction to become one of the greatest works in the future, alongside the youtube great of &quot;Reactions to Two Girls and One Cup&quot;. <br />
<br />
Overall (1): There are those who would describe Mars of Destruction as: &quot;Powerful&quot;, &quot;Heartwarming&quot;, &quot;Epic&quot;, &quot;Godly&quot;, and &quot;Orgasmic&quot;. Though such words are usually reserved for works of literary genius such as Shakespeare, they just might apply to Mars of Destruction as well. Indeed, Mars of Destruction serves as the Macbeth of Anime. <br />

    &quot;A catastrophic success&quot;<br />
<br />
Brought to us with deeply enchanting thoughts of science fiction and a twist of quirky humor, Mars of Destruction demonstrates exactly what the animation industry lacks these days: a sense of sarcastic Japanese comedy. Why do I say Mars of Destruction exemplifies the epitome of funniness? Everything about it is so terrible that you are chuckling, frustrated, or amused at the overly large level of appalling abominations. <br />
<br />
Just looking at the premise and seeing how several teenager females and a high school male managed to progress into supers soldiers fighting big, bad, giant alien monster; the audience is prostrated with a highly conceptual

          <span style="display: none;" id="review75205">
        ontogenetic metaphor. Through memories and flashbacks we are able to learn a shocking amount of knowledge on the main character. I mean, he’s got daddy problems and the sense of self ignorance, which we see in no other works like Neon Genesis Evangelion. In essence, it makes several allusions even to the infamous Guilty Crown, which everyone knows embodies the best script-writing, logical story sequences, ever.   <br />
 <br />
The Animation is also a very daring one; everything is symbolic and down even to the thinnest line we can see the most significant items are given the most amounts of attention and details. For example, the stop lights and police cars all illustrate the sentimental authority in which we are restricted by; copiously, it even makes very strong commentary on human destruction and our behavior as utter monstrous creations. Oh, the music? I mean, everything is totally out of sync but that’s done on purpose to furnish the attention back to the content and script, which makes the show soo worth it to watch. Although the soundtracks themselves sound like amateur midi’s downloaded from the Internet, I can safely assure you that the word MIDI is an abbreviation for “Milking Iguana’s Divine Intervention,” which in itself may sound like ridicule of animal cruelty, but actually contrasts animated robots with Iguanas. <br />
<br />
By the way, I can be very dry and sarcastic. <br />
<br />
On that note, the story is very 3-dimensional (just like the animation) and the excessive amounts of philosophy they put into the show such as humans coming from another planet really supported other intriguing and horrifying elements of the show. The three girls with great character designs even contributed to the juxtaposition between the deeply ingested realism they gave to Sir Chopin Frederic’s work and the elephant-like brutality those aliens had.<br />
<br />
With all respect, Mars of Destruction is a highly symbolic work, which utilizes the craftiness of its music and animation, and brings about its legacy by mixing the cultural Godzilla’s and metaphysics within Chopin Frederic’s masterpiece Midi’s. What are you waiting for? Mars of Destruction is ready and subbed/dubbed on your nearest anime sites. Direct your full attention to the electronic screen and be prepared for 20 minutes of straight hilarious humor.<br />

    This is the best title I&#039;ve ever seen. The second 10 score in my rating since Rebuild 2.22.<br />
Neophytes and schoolchildren won&#039;t understand, so I&#039;ll explain sense of this show-for-all-times.<br />
<br />
Obviously it is none other than delicate parody on 95% of anime series. Mars of Destruction includes most of anime cliches, and all of them are made in 20 minutes.<br />
I&#039;ll try to recall some of those moments, which drove me into ecstasies.<br />
<br />
First of all, bunch of nameless multicolored-hair girls as the Super Defending Power of Earth. In other titles their names are generated via randomizer ans nobody remembers them, but here this problem is solved.<br />
Then, the greatest

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30008">
        joke in anime ever: &quot;Sorry, looks like she died&quot; in hospital after girl&#039;s head being completely blown off.<br />
<br />
Second point is the Simple Japaneese Schoolboy as SuperHero in charge of saving Earth from SUCH monsters. He has superpower-suit and he don&#039;t want to be a hero, but he MUST to protect those he loves.<br />
<br />
When it goes to battle scenes, Mars of Destruction is also inimitable. Action to all fields, oh man, these fights will make your heart tremble, just like we saw in NGE. Main Evil Guy revives after being defeated as he gathered together all his remaining strenth, OH WOW, don&#039;t you recall some series with resemble turn of plot? I think, every second.<br />
<br />
Main story is also shocking and unpredictable, with deep and philosophical outcome. <br />
In other banal series absolutely same plot is usually being prolong  for 20+ episodes and provokes tons of happyness, you know -  oh my god, SUCH DEEP IDEA, we are invaders, and THEM are real earthlings, i&#039;m going to give &quot;10&quot;!<br />
<br />
I&#039;m finished. Please, be thankful to Idea Factory. They, geniuses, catched the essence of anime and crystallized it.

    I simply could not resist writing a short review for what is truly a one-of-a-kind anime. Mars of Destruction is unlike any anime you have ever seen before; it is an indescribable experience that is hard to put into words, but I will do my best.<br />
<br />
Why does this anime receive a 1/10? Because we are not allowed to give 0/10 ratings. Mars of Destruction isn&#039;t just bad, it is hypnotically bad. Fascinatingly awful. Spectacularly dreadful. Not a single imaginable aspect of this 20 minute OVA was done even remotely right. The fact that something this laughably stupid exists is an absolute anomaly.<br />
 <br />
The plot? There

          <span style="display: none;" id="review133181">
        wasn&#039;t one. Ask 10 different people what they thought this anime was about and you will likely get 10 completely different answers.<br />
The characters? Worst I&#039;ve ever seen. The fact that we are supposed to emotionally connect with them is hilarious.<br />
The art? Bottom of the barrel. Looks awful.<br />
The sound? Worst voice acting and sound effects I&#039;ve ever heard, and it&#039;s not close.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t be fooled by my rating; I would highly recommend that you take the 20 minutes that is necessary to watch Mars of Destruction. Why do I think you should watch it? Because of how interesting it is that something this bad could have somehow been animated. How this thing even exists, we&#039;ll never know, but Mars of Destruction is a rare case of something being so indescribably bad that it is actually entertaining to watch. From the first moment that some random girl&#039;s head comically explodes into blood as the audience is supposed to feel bad for her, you know that you are watching something special. <br />
We can not fully appreciate a truly good anime until we see an anime that is truly terrible. Enjoy the absurdity.

    Before I begin, I should say that this is my 1st anime review. Of course, you&#039;ve probably read countless reviews praising this anime&#039;s beauty. Mine is probably no different, as it simply states the truth. No anime that I&#039;ve watched previously has evoked such strong emotions as Mars of Destruction, except maybe Tenkuu Danzato Skelter Heaven, which was made by the same amazing people as Mars of Destruction. I would give this amazing show a 11, but unfortunately MyAnimeList limits the score at 10. This anime is truly the pinnacle of Japanese animation.<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
Where should I begin? Mars of Destruction has probably the most interesting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review127359">
        and fully fleshed out plot that I&#039;ve ever seen in an anime. It&#039;s more emotional than Steins;gate, especially when unnamed girl #1 tragically dies within 10 seconds of the second scene. It&#039;s more exciting than FMA: Brotherhood, and has more explosions than a Michael Bay film. Even as an action oriented anime, they still manage to masterfully craft a romance between Takeru, the hero of the story, and that girl whose name I forgot. The plot twist at the end was one of the most shocking and unpredictable in anime history. Even more impressive is the fact that they managed to pull this off in 1 episode.<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
Despite this being a 2005 anime, the quality of the video was reminiscent of 1980&#039;s anime, which is obviously a homage to classic anime such as Dragon Ball. The stiffness of the animation is clearly intentional as well, as it is symbolic of something. The fact that I don&#039;t know what the stiffness of the animation symbolizes is proof of how deep and philosophical this anime is. It&#039;s probably some truth about human nature. The art style is unique to say the least, and certainly kicks inferior anime like Gintama and Clannad down to the ground.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
One cannot fully understand how moving the OST is until he hears it with his own ears. They managed to artfully integrate classical pieces such as the Barber of Seville and transitioned between pieces flawlessly to further enhance the atmosphere. Voice acting, as always, was superb, with emotion dripping... nay, flooding from each immaculately delivered line. I could almost feel the pain myself in unnamed girl #1&#039;s voice as she wept for Takeru&#039;s grave injuries from getting touched multiple times by the aliens.<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
It&#039;s amazing how well the makers of Mars of Destruction managed to develop all of the characters in merely 19 minutes. Each character had a unique, distinct personality, as well as appearance (not that appearance matters that much, for true beauty is found on the inside, right?). I found myself being able to relate with almost all of the characters. I especially enjoyed Takeru&#039;s character. His childhood was especially emotional, and his dilemma is clearly outlined throughout the entire show. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever been more affected by any other 11 second flashback. As mentioned earlier, the romance that blossoms between unnamed girl #1 and Takeru is as deep as, if not more so than, that of Clannad.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
I&#039;m not gonna lie, I found this anime more enjoyable than any other anime that I&#039;ve watched, except maybe Tenkuu Danzato Skelter Heaven. It has evoked in me more emotions than Steins;gate and Clannad combined. Times 2. Of course, for me to simply say that this anime is the most enjoyable out of the ~50 that I&#039;ve watched does it poor justice. To truly understand, one would need to watch it for himself.<br />
<br />
Misc:<br />
I loved the pop culture references that were scattered throughout Mars of Destruction. The sword made out of light was an obvious nod to the iconic lightsaber from Star Wars. The neon lines across the MARS suit was probably a reference Tron. To be honest, the gratuitous amount of blood did not really enhance the anime, but knowing the makers, it probably symbolizes the violent nature of humanity, regardless of whether they originated in Mars or Earth.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
I&#039;ve said it before, but it is worth repeating. This anime is truly the acme of Japanese animation. The story, art, sound, character- everything was top-notch. Disregard its poor score, it&#039;s just from an influx of FMA: Brotherhood fanboys wanting to cover up the fact that if rated fairly, this anime would overthrow it and take #1 in top rated anime. If you regard yourself as a true anime fan, do NOT, and I repeat, do NOT miss out on this amazing anime. You will be enlightened, just as I have been.

    This is a review compiled by the many members of the VIA (Value In Anime) Graveyard Division. All members who have worked on this review are mentioned at the bottom. In addition, this review will also contain a “Value in the Anime” section detailing life lessons and values that make this anime worth watching.<br />
-------------------<br />
Mars of Destruction is an anime often said to be the worst anime ever made, an opinion backed up by it&#039;s abysmally low score. Despite its many flaws, however, there are still reasons to take the time to watch it.<br />
<br />
Story: This is one of the best parts of Mars of Destruction, though

          <span style="display: none;" id="review118891">
        that isn’t saying much. The story was inconsistent as it mixed a number of different anime and clichés into it&#039;s easy-to-watch 19 minutes, detracting from the over all plot while the climax, though interesting, was unfulfilled due to it&#039;s brevity and awkward delivery. The story had potential, enough that it may have been a semi-popular series had it been of proper length, but that&#039;s about it. Potential is only potential if it remains untapped. It was a short, poorly flowing anime rife with inconsistency.<br />
<br />
Art: The animation was very bad with the fight scenes being particularly unimpressive. The enemies did not instill any fear or wonder and the entire thing was very choppy while the backgrounds, aesthetically adequate, were nothing special. The character designs weren’t bland, but they were uninspired and the anime looked like it was made many years before it actually was; it was haphazardly designed. It was so poor that a member mistook the anime for something else entirely, becoming confused.<br />
<br />
Sound: Mars of Destruction featured many artists, including Beethoven, Satie, and Chopin. While we all agreed that we liked compositions, it did not fit well with the style or theme of the anime. As far as we could tell, there was no OST to speak of. The voice acting was also very bad with the voices of the antagonists being especially poor while the &quot;moaning&quot; of the characters, though &quot;interesting&quot;, didn&#039;t translate to good acting. Unequivocally, it was a mess. <br />
<br />
Characters: We did not find ourselves attached to any characters, although we admit this was in part to the time limit the anime had. There was a single character that had some semblance of character development, and even then it was somewhat typical. None of us could remember any of the characters names. For some reason there were a lot of female characters, skewing the gender ratio--perhaps in the hope that it would draw in more viewers. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: We were split on enjoyment. Some of us liked the anime and enjoyed it thoroughly while some of us were forcing ourselves to finish it. The climax of the story is definitely memorable, if nothing else. If you like gore, it definitely scratches that itch. Don’t try to watch more than once to try and solve the most glaring plot hole as one of our members did, there is no solution! It is perhaps the most noticeable flaw in this anime, which sets a precedent of poor quality for the rest of the show. <br />
<br />
Values in the Anime: There is value in this anime that makes it worth watching--certain life lessons that we can all take to heart.<br />
<br />
Peace Above All Else: The two opposing forces in this anime fought for various reasons that are never fully explained. We all agreed however, that this fight could have been avoided. There is one line where a character asks the enemy, “You can talk?” A peaceful resolution might have been found through talking. Things are not always what they seem. Consider everyone before a fight starts, or you will regret it later.<br />
<br />
Throughout the anime, we have the badass squad of super-soldiers fighting against the evil aliens. We immediately have the idea that this badass squad is made up of the great heroes fighting against the terrible, ugly invaders. Violence is glorified, and those who fight on your side are always the good guys. The enemy is always the bad guys. Violence is a often avoidable and should always be the last resort.<br />
<br />
Anime and contemporary reality: To think that &quot;we&quot; are all martians who invaded earth million years ago means only one thing. &quot;We&quot; destroyed Mars and now Earth is on the verge of dying. This anime in its erroneous way was trying to expose a truth about our current world. If we don&#039;t take care of Earth, then we will yet again have to consider looking for another planet. <br />
<br />
Love Earth, love nature.<br />
<br />
Stand up for Yourself: Do not fight because the law dictates so or because you&#039;re simply told to, but follow your personal beliefs while being aware of what lives are being risked over. Stand up for yourself even though the result is clear, and don&#039;t accept your ‘planned fate.’<br />

    Mars of Destruction is the lowest rated anime on this website. People are constantly talking about how terrible it was so I had to check it out. I thought that it couldn&#039;t be as bad as they were saying. Now that I&#039;ve finally seen it, I was pleasantly surprised. I now know that it is exactly as bad as they say. Make no mistake, this is hands down the worst anime I have ever seen. But at the same time, I recommend it highly. Why you ask? Let&#039;s go in and find out.<br />
<br />
The story is about aliens attacking. And then a some guy tries to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review73861">
        fight off said aliens in a robotic power suit known as MARS that he is forced to fight in by his faceless Dad. This guy is joined by a group of women. They stop the aliens. Then there&#039;s a big twist where they find that the aliens are humans and the humans are aliens. That&#039;s pretty much the entire movie in a nutshell. The story is like if you tried to cram the entirety of Evangelion into 20 minutes. Only worse than that. It&#039;s badly paced, incredibly disjointed and highly unoriginal. There isn&#039;t really much else to say. It&#039;s bad.<br />
<br />
The girls are kind of cute. I&#039;ll give them that. That&#039;s why I give the art a 2 instead of a 1. Everything else sucks. The animation is constantly reused, the art is uninspired and the character designs are bland as hell. Tell me that the brown haired one doesn&#039;t look like Asuka. Come on. I dare you. The lead guy looks like a pussy, I guess. It&#039;s hard to form proper opinions on something so short. It was bad, okay.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack consists of a bunch of classical music. HOW WONDERFULLY ORIGINAL! Beethoven is timeless but the way the music is integrated is laughable. Actually it&#039;s not just laughable. It&#039;s hilarious. The funniest part is that the music always gets cut off abruptly. You can kind of tell that the only reason why they used it was so they didn&#039;t have to create their own music. I don&#039;t speak Japanese but from what I could gather, the voice acting sounded pretty awful the whole way through. Even Minori Chihara can&#039;t save it. Sound is bad. Moving on.<br />
<br />
Character development? What&#039;s that? No one in this movie has any personality. They aren&#039;t annoying at all. But they are the most bland group of characters you will ever see. I think they&#039;re based off of character types. The main character might be a Shinji rip off. I really don&#039;t know. They don&#039;t do much in the 20 minutes. There&#039;s nothing else I can really say. There&#039;s nothing to comment on. I don&#039;t remember a single character from the movie for positive or negative reasons.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s because of these flaws that Mars of Destruction is one of the most entertaining anime out there. I was struggling with the score. It was either a 1 or a 10. I went with a 1 because that felt right. I usually rate anime based on how much I enjoy the show but with this I just can&#039;t. Even so, this is the epitome of &#039;so bad it&#039;s good&#039;. It&#039;s really fun to point out all the flaws because there&#039;s so many. It&#039;s the sort of thing people use for drinking games. Drink every time Beethoven gets cut off, drink every time they copy Evangelion, the list goes on. It&#039;s like the movie was made for drinking games. It&#039;s bad fun. I highly recommend it. It&#039;s only 20 minutes so it won&#039;t take much time out of your day. It&#039;s about as long as an episode without credits. If you haven&#039;t seen it, watch it now. If you have, watch it again. This film is a masterpiece in suck and it deserves to be seen by everyone. So what are you waiting for?

    Let me start off by saying that I do not regret spending any of the 19 minutes that I spent on this show. In just less than half an hour, I was taken on an unforgettable journey that compelled me to think about humanity as a whole as well as individual responsibility. I can clearly say that Mars of Destruction has made me a better person and a happier one too.<br />
<br />
Story 10/10- Very thought-provoking and metaphorical. I would name a handful of the plethora of symbolism prevalent in this masterpiece, but I can&#039;t think of any at the moment. When it was revealed that humans

          <span style="display: none;" id="review26460">
        were the true invaders, I thought about what the Europeans did to the Native Americans. They forced their way into their homelands. <br />
<br />
Art 10/10 - I like how when Takeru fires his lazer, it appears to go right past the Ancient and hit the truck. Nice original style of animation that emphasizes the mysterious quality of the Ancients.<br />
<br />
Sound 10/10 - Top notch growling sounds from the Ancients, especially when they are being hit by bullets. Bravo. I also praise whoever produced the original classical music for this work. Takeru&#039;s not prepubescent voice was also not annoying, since we listen to his manly screams and grunts a lot throughout the show. <br />
<br />
Character 10/10- After watching through Mars of Destruction a second time, I noticed, contrary to what I had originally thought, that everyone in the team had a name. That is the level of strong characters that I greatly admire in Mars of Destruction. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10 - Great deal of emotion coming from this show. It kept me laughing throughout the entire thing. I also felt very sad when Unknown Girl&#039;s head was blown off. Her death was devastating to me, and when the doctor confirmed it later with his &quot;This one&#039;s totally gone&quot; I cried. But I was still laughing.<br />
<br />
Overall 10/10 - Great series, it can make you laugh, cry, or be afraid. No doubt one of the best additions to the Sci-fi and horror genres.

    The only thing I give it credit to this &quot;anime&quot; it&#039;s for the highly philosophical content. This really makes me question myself &quot;what the fuck i&#039;m doing with my life? why i&#039;m watching this?&quot;.<br />
Well, after that I realized the &quot;director&quot; of this &quot;anime&quot; it&#039;s the same of Skelter-Heaven, another ode to garbage, I refuse to believe that this wasn&#039;t made intentionally bad. It can&#039;t get any worse because seriously, IT CAN&#039;T.<br />
Forgive them, Beethoven...<br />

    I beseech my readers, please; bear with me and finish reading this review, so that you too can take part of this experience. <br />
<br />
&quot;The wisest man is he who understands that he understands nothing&quot;.<br />
<br />
I have embarked on a journey. A journey of understanding, set upon by all sides by the naysayers and those who seek to cause me to stray from my path. I stand firm to the end though; it is I who choose my own fate, and entangle myself in this intricately and masterfully crafted web of deceit, betrayal, and the meaning of life itself. <br />
The story kept me mystified and engaged up

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181415">
        through the conclusion, which stretched my comprehension and challenged all of my knowledge of the visual and written mediums heretofore. I at once had both my cognition and soul assaulted in such a piercingly stimulating and agonizingly adroit way that my entire inner being was measured against the overwhelming superiority of what I had just witnessed, and came up entirely inferior. <br />
<br />
The method by which this inexplicable tale slowly intoxicates and permeates the consciousness is incredible to experience. You&#039;re slowly drawn into a convincing narrative of humanity struggling against an enemy they have no understanding of, or means to fight- save one experimental military test suit, known only as MARS. <br />
<br />
The spiritual journey of Mars of Destruction was all too brief however, and left me on a desert island of mental dryness and inability to describe the euphoria.<br />
<br />
<br />
Alright, time to really break this thing down. What we have here is, dear readers, is an animated episode of Power Rangers. I&#039;m dead serious. We open with the Black Power Ranger and his harem of skilled? military ladies taking on the nefarious forces of... mutated alien evil? Giant, evil, mutated aliens WITH FRICKEN LASER BEAMS COMING FROM THEIR EYES. <br />
The gallant Black Power Ranger, complete with his transformation sequence and laser sword in hand, steps out onto the streets to do battle with the invaders, but all does not go as planned. The team is defeated, and our hero sent to the hospital.. on his deathbed he remembers that he&#039;s fighting for.. something, I guess.. and decides to kickstart his own heart so he can get back into the suit ASAP and whoop some alien ass. <br />
<br />
Apparently there are some space rocks that are supersecret and in need of transportation from Japan to America (by truck?) for studying by the &quot;American Research Institute&quot; (not joking, actual name). Who better suited to the task than the military&#039;s top harem and their last remaining, newly rehabilitated Power Ranger?? <br />
<br />
Back on the tough streets, it&#039;s Battle Royale 2: Electric Boogaloo, this time with Extra Deus Ex Machina Power! Once again, our heroines are getting their rears handed to them on a silver platter, because their only reaction to the enemy is to shoot their ineffective &quot;plasma guns&quot; at it over and over (infinite ammo cheat/no reloads on, as well). Out steps the Black Ranger, but this time he&#039;s GOT A GUN! It&#039;s never been tested before, it&#039;s super dangerous.. they don&#039;t know even if it will work, but it&#039;s the moon rocks&#039; only chance at making it to America! Lo, and behold: the Gigan ripoff alien is defeated, but not before he has the chance to melt your brain and make you question your entire existence with such introspective and shocking words never before seen in the visual medium: Humans are the invaders of Earth, and the aliens are actually the original Earthlings banished to Mars. <br />
&quot;WOW&quot;, I thought. What if I&#039;m actually infringing on some alien&#039;s property.. what if I&#039;m not even from this planet? What was Idea Factory trying to tell me??<br />
I&#039;ll probably never know, because I&#039;ll forget I even watched this crap right after I finish writing this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Side note: Sound: It made use of fantastic classics such as Ride of the Valkyries by Wagner, and the Barber of Seville by Rossini.. not to great effect, but they at least sounded pretty good. <br />
<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll end with a relevant quote from the opening lines of Mars of Destruction:<br />
&quot;I want to finish this quickly, I need a beer&quot;<br />
<br />
Peace out guys, I&#039;m offering free Clorox eye washes and hypnosis therapy for anyone who needs to get this out of their system. Hit me up behind Walmart. <br />

By stretching your credulity to the breaking point. This is 19 minutes and 25 seconds of your life that would be better spent giving yourself a circumcision with a rusty tin can lid.

    It was worth watching just because now when I watch good anime I can appreciate it more.<br />
Since as you no doubt know, this is a piece of trash. It was obviously designed by a 10 year old boy who had a really influential father and therefore managed to get it animated. I see no other way how anyone would ever fund it&#039;s creation.<br />
I only watched it since it was the lowest rated anime in MAL, which undoubtably the only reason you&#039;re here reading the reviews.<br />
The Story is a 1 because it has no story, or if it did it didnt make sense.<br />
The Art is a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review12428">
        1 because things teleported around, etc.<br />
The Sound is a 2 just because there is the possibilty it could have been worse.<br />
The Character is a 1 because every single character has less personality than a rock.<br />
The Enjoyment was a 3 just because the girls head exploding was so stupid it made me laugh.<br />
Overall it is a 2 since it was a learning experience for me, since I never knew anime got that bad. And also cause of the aforementioned head explosion.

    This anime in one word: (No such word exists)<br />
<br />
My feelings after watching it in one(several) word(s): Lost/Confused/Angry/Sad/WTF!?!<br />
<br />
My thoughts after watching it: Why would somebody hurt my feelings like that? <br />
<br />
Overall quality: Priceless<br />
<br />
Honestly if you have not watched &quot;Mars of Destruction&quot; yet I dont want to tell you that you should because I&#039;m pretty sure its a crime to tell someone to try and kill themselves and I cant handle that responsibility right now. But if you have read this review and still want to watch it I commend you for not having 20 minutes to spend better. Do ANYTHING else in 20 minutes, even re-lace

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25193">
        your shoes or even call Dell and talk to one of those frustrating Indian guys and I PROMISE you will have spent your time more productively. I hope I dont have nightmares.
