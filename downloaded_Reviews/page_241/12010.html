    Wow. After only 4 episodes,  I can already tell you this show is going to go down in history.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with the story: I haven&#039;t seen anything this original in a long time. From the very first frames, I was locked in. How did our protagonist go from being a failed isekai MC after getting hit by a truck, to going ultra-instinct, to being disembodied and placed in a box? How did he end up on a ship and why are two babes coming to rescue him? It&#039;s been quite some time since I&#039;ve seen an anime with a first episode as great as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376971">
        this one. 10/10<br />
<br />
Art: Flawless. Many people seem to not like the animation for some reason, but I don&#039;t know why. Personally, the CG animation allows for some of the most fluid battle scenes this season. Why do popular animes like AoT get a pass for having CG animation, but this masterpiece doesn&#039;t? I also really liked a lot of the backdrops that the animators created--they really contribute to the world-building and immersion. The characters are extremely expressive, the choreography is amazing, and all around the art in this show should NOT be getting this much hate. 10/10<br />
<br />
Sound: Impeccable. The OP and ED are phenomenal. The voice-acting team is joined by the likes of Kitou Akari (who voiced Nezuko in Kimetsu no Yaiba), Mikako Komatsu (who voiced Totsuka in Oregairu), and Saitou Souma (who voiced Tatsumi in Akame ga Kill!). With such a star-studded cast, how could this show be bad? 10/10<br />
<br />
Character: GOAT. Every single character has tons of development, and the MC has a really cool backstory. Get this: he really doesn&#039;t like technology, but then he BECOMES TECHNOLOGY. Mind. Blown. The show really goes out of its way to develop its villains as characters in themselves, and not just as obstacles for our characters to overcome. The guy who could phase through objects in the first episode is already one of my favorite anime villains of all time. 10/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: In case you already couldn&#039;t tell, this is an amazing anime. It makes its 20-minute episodes feel like you&#039;ve been watching for hours because they&#039;re all filled with so much content. I can&#039;t peel my eyes away from the screen in fear of missing out on something. The jokes are witty and well-delivered, and I can&#039;t wait to see the relationship between the robot and the MC develop more! 10/10<br />
<br />
Overall: Anime of the season contender. Scratch that. Anime of the CENTURY contender. 1000000/10

    “What is the meaning of life?”<br />
<br />
Ex-Arm is a phenomenal anime. It is a beauty to behold for the mind, the ears, and the eyes. It is a landmark achievement in art and animation, which no other anime shall surpass. It pulls you in, then touches your soul. You will feel a powerful range of emotions that you have never felt before—happiness, sadness, rage, ecstasy, and fear. Every time the opening song “Rise Again” began, I felt goosebumps run down my spine. The orgasmic CGI animation will make you vomit your brains out. You will ultimately feel satisfaction unmatched by anything you have ever experienced. <br />
<br />
Imagine

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387563">
        if Tommy Wiseau wrote the Matrix, you would get this anime. Nay, Ex-Arm is more than an anime. It is an intelligent homage to the most prestigious anime directors, Hayao Miyazaki and Makoto Shinkai. HiRock beautifully wrote the characters, and in the anime, they looked so realistic. I could practically touch them. While I watched Ex-Arm, they were my best friends. Their quest to convert the 2D humans into 3D inspired me. Someday I hope to become 3D too. As I watched the characters face the horrors of war and overcome prejudices, I learned that I, too, could be a CGI hero. They made me rethink everything I knew about morality, society, and sexuality.<br />
<br />
My words are not enough to express how thankful I am for the existence of the director, Yoshikatsu Kimura, for this masterpiece. A man who was, in his own words, inspired by Christopher Nolan. I kneel at the foot of my bed every night and thank god for Kimura. Thanks to him, we finally have an answer to life’s greatest question. The meaning of life is...<br />
<br />
To watch Ex-Arm.<br />

    In the 1993 blockbuster &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; Ian Malcolm confronts John Hammond and his scientists over their genetic resurrection of the dinosaurs. “Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.&quot; Words to live by, but as it turns out, all the scientists in the world couldn&#039;t account for the possibility that dinosaurs would be, y&#039;know, hungry.<br />
<br />
Yoshikatsu Kimura, a live-action filmmaker, stated that his upcoming show &quot;Ex-Arm&quot; would give audiences something never before seen in anime. Yeah, we&#039;ve certainly never seen a travesty like this before. Like John Hammond, Kimura lacked foresight to recognize a bad

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376895">
        idea. Unlike Hammond, Kimura, along with fellow inexperienced collaborators, lacked the relevant expertise to cope with an already-dire situation. Here&#039;s how to derail your anime project in 4 easy steps:<br />
<br />
- Step 1: Bring In People Who Have No Experience In Anime.<br />
<br />
Yoshikatsu Kimura is not a director. Well, not for anime at least, and to call his efforts on Ex-Arm &quot;directing&quot; would be an insult to the profession. His live-action resume doesn&#039;t inspire confidence either, with only a handful of B-rated local martial arts movies to his name. How this man landed a job like this is beyond me.<br />
Visual Flight is not an animation studio. The staff have barely any animation expertise, with most of their work centered around creating character models and environments. Most notable is their involvement in the video game &quot;Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,&quot; although having the wrong credentials doesn&#039;t mean shit. It&#039;s like asking a Biology professor to teach a course on Physics just because they&#039;re both sciences.<br />
Ryo Tomisaka is not an animation compositor. This role is reserved for those capable of seamlessly blending in animation, backgrounds and visual effects in the same space. Tomisaka is no specialist in this field, instead only having done general design work for a now-defunct company.<br />
All these people sound like a perfect fit, hire them! What&#039;s the worst that could happen?<br />
<br />
- Step 2: Misappropriate Your Tiny Budget.<br />
<br />
Two key concepts here: &quot;Misappropriation of Funds&quot; and &quot;Tiny Budget.&quot; Crunchyroll&#039;s production committee is responsible for both. They stacked their bets on an untested rookie director, and allotted too few funds to prevent the inevitable shitstorm that would occur. <br />
Kimura is the second big culprit. Treating Ex-Arm as any other live-action production, he contacted a stunt team, whom he had worked with on past projects, to shoot motion capture for the anime. It&#039;s quite an impressive investment, given that hiring stuntmen for mo-cap doesn&#039;t come cheap. Typically it&#039;s up to the animators to perform the movements, before making the necessary changes in post. But the reason why animators normally perform their mo-cap in-house is, drum roll, because they&#039;re animators. Naturally this presented an issue for Visual Flight and Tomisaka, who have all this movement data but lack the skills required to make that choreography make sense in animation. And even the parts that avoided the mo-cap treatment are now worse off, since so much cash was splashed on the stunt work. The production staff put all their eggs in one basket, and things were about to get rotten.<br />
<br />
- Step 3: Panic.<br />
<br />
Realise that your ineptitude and shitty spending reduced your budget to all but 2 USD and the pre-21st Century IBM laptop used for rendering. Forget the ambition that landed you this job, forget making something even serviceable. You&#039;re lucky to even come up with 20 minutes of footage each week. Cut. Every. Cost. Inexperienced animators? Reduce their work down to lipflaps, they&#039;ll finish an entire episode before Lunch. Oh, and let&#039;s hold still shots of naked characters monologuing for a minute long, with a plain white gradient as the background. Wait, the manga has a queer kissing scene? Too complex, let&#039;s just throw in a lens flare and make the Internet think we&#039;re homophobic. Remember everyone, we&#039;re not really &quot;half&quot;-assing, it&#039;s closer to &quot;three-fourths.&quot; This is still nearly the best you could do, even if Daddy CR felt more generous.<br />
<br />
- Step 4: Profit (Or Lack Thereof, Because You&#039;ve Made the Worst TV Anime of All-Time.)<br />
<br />
Great work! Now it&#039;s time to sit back and revel in the bitter fruits of your labor. Even after taking into account that this is Kimura&#039;s first outing in animation, his final product makes you question if he&#039;s ever stepped foot in a film school to begin with. Ex-Arm is filled with the most questionable shot editing imaginable. At times Kimura would hold entire shots for almost a whole minute, in others he&#039;d make short jump-cuts that add nothing to a scene. Sequences progress with no logical sense or continuity, with most action scenes feeling as if two or three storyboard panels got skipped over. The only traits Kimura seems to have retained from his resume are some of live-action&#039;s most notorious, such as unnecessary shaky cams and random Zach Snyder zooms whenever characters so much as turn their cheeks to the camera. Meanwhile, the only &quot;Visual Flight&quot; this studio managed to stitch together was torture that hurts as much as chucking your eyeballs down a flight of stairs. If a character does nothing but speak in-frame, Ex-Arm shamelessly resorts to slapping on a lipflap onto a 2D comic-strip character. This occurs even if other 3D models make unnerving movements while sharing the screen. Stilted, frozen facial expressions are the norm, as only the jaws are ever animated. Tomisaka tops it all off with some of the worst VFX work since the 2000s. Scenes that are remotely action-intensive have characters move across the screen with their after images intact, like the cover of an &quot;Animorphs&quot; novel. Frame rate drops are common, even for the most rudimentary of action sequences. The compositing boils down to &quot;add a green-screen template and lower the opacity,&quot; with fire and dust particles ripped straight from YouTube. Any other assets end up looking like ass, with gross visual distortions and bullets that travel at walking speed. And keep in mind that there are still other amateurs on your payroll. The guy in charge of the score is a guitar teacher. Your series composer, Tommy Morton, also has no prior anime credits to his name. On Episode 2 you have a storyboard artist who probably took up this job part-time as a means of breaking into the industry, only to realize the abomination he contributed to and subsequently give up credit on the episode, choosing instead to list the software company where he did his day-job (this is speculation, I can&#039;t think of any other reason as to why a random business solutions company would show up in the credits.) The budget cuts hit other areas hard too; such as the crappy excuse of an OP or scuffed lines of dialogue. That&#039;s right, a professional recording job featuring decent VAs includes peaking audio, cDawgVA would mald.<br />
Congratulations, you have made a mess.<br />
<br />
What makes a failure? I think the answer lies in the fact that I came into this anime with the sole intent of finding out what a 1-rated show would feel like. Similarly, most people are only giving Ex-Arm attention in order to see if it&#039;s as bad as everyone says. I can&#039;t think of a single audience member who has unironically been better off with this show for the intended purpose, and that&#039;s what makes it a failure in my eyes. It takes a special degree of incompetence to screw up so egregiously. As a guy who&#039;s lenient on mediocre visuals and finds nice things to say about most cheaply-animated SoLs, this is the first time I&#039;ve witnessed a show with production this bafflingly bad; it fully prevents me from enjoying anything noteworthy in terms of writing. And the script has decent worldbuilding, doing a well thought-out sci-fi spin on the cop procedural format. Admittedly, there are genuinely fun ideas even in the visual department, but they are fleeting and far in-between. However, these qualities will never get their time in the spotlight, because production across all aspects is so comically horrendous. Ex-Arm is the end result of systematic failure, with all parties involved woefully out of their depth. This was a team that neither could nor should have come within a 10-mile radius of the dingy basement studio this was animated in. I&#039;d feel sorry for the mangaka, but my sympathy reserves go about as far as an hour of this ocular torture porn.  <br />
<br />
There is a parable in the book of Luke, which goes as follows: &#039;“Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won’t you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it? For if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule you, saying, ‘This person began to build and wasn’t able to finish.’&#039; (14:28-30) Ex-Arm may not be found in the Scriptures, but nonetheless is a failure of Biblical proportions. Jesus Himself couldn&#039;t save this &quot;anime,&quot; and I use quotes since calling this hack adaptation one would be too generous a compliment. Instead, this incomplete husk that is Ex-Arm will live on as a subject of ridicule, and a reminder. A cautionary tale, warning of the dangers of failing to count your cost.<br />
To the post-Sony-acquisition Crunchyroll: for the love of God, please leave anime to the people who can f^cking make them. 1/10~<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Yup, that&#039;s a wrap. My quest for finding a 1 has come to an end, and it feels pretty surreal. It&#039;s not even like I&#039;m upset, just really bemused at this unprecedented disaster. Gotta drop it early to preserve my sanity. If you happen to like my verbose rants, feel free to check out my other reviews on actually-watchable shows for seasons past and present. Till then, peace~

    &quot;Ground-breaking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ex-Arm is an anime that is largely misconceived. Look at all the people saying how godawful the writing and especially the animation is. However, they couldn&#039;t have been further from the truth. In reality, Ex-Arm is a visionary masterpiece with little to no flaws. Every single person involved with the anime&#039;s production was extremely passionate about it, and they put a monstrous amount of effort into making it incredibly compelling and profound. As a result, Ex-Arm has become the greatest SF series of all time, and possibly one of the greatest things mankind has ever created. PERIOD.<br />
<br />
......<br />
<br />
Now, let&#039;s get serious for a bit.<br />
<br />
Ex-Arm is originally

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387560">
        a Sci-Fi manga written by HiRock and illustrated by Tonya Komi. Although not exactly amazing, the manga is actually a pretty entertaining read from what I have seen. Coupled with good art, it offers some interesting concepts that are executed decently. The anime adaptation of Ex-Arm, on the other hand, is a completely different story.<br />
<br />
The plot of Ex-Arm follows a high school student named Akira Natsume, who is dissatisfied for being rather ordinary and wants to change himself for the better. Unfortunately, though, luck doesn&#039;t seem to be on his side. One day while trying to save a girl from a bunch of delinquents, Akira gets hit by a truck. But instead of dying, he wakes up to realize that he is now in 2030 and has turned into a mere brain stored inside a superweapon.<br />
<br />
And then everything goes horribly wrong.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a no brainer to say the main issue with Ex-Arm is rooted in its animation. After watching the anime my standards for animation have become considerably low—I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s a good thing or not. Ex-Arm has one of the most awful production quality I have ever seen in any piece of media, not only anime. Just show a clip or two to someone who hasn&#039;t heard of what it is, I guarantee you that they are going to think it&#039;s nothing but a joke. After all, looking at the animation, it&#039;s hard to believe this was made with serious intentions.<br />
<br />
Ex-Arm&#039;s CGI is spectacularly horrendous. It feels like the animators learned how to do CGI few weeks ago and decided to experiment how much they had learned. And to be honest, it just might be true. Cars, trees, roads, buildings—every single object of the show looks horrible; some of those were probably straight-up taken from YouTube or some other website. Everything else seems as if they were animated by a bunch of amateurs. Actually, never mind. Saying that would be underestimating actual amateurs. It&#039;s much worse than that.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t know there could be bugs and glitches in anime, but Ex-Arm has proven me wrong. Very bizarre glitches appear out of nowhere from time to time, and they are honestly a sight to behold. Unbelievably awkward zoom-ins and zoom-ups are a norm in the show; they never serve any actual purpose. The shot transitions are a fucking mess too; a lot of sequences proceed without any sense of rationality whatsoever. And surprise, surprise! It isn&#039;t the fault of the original manga.<br />
<br />
However, action is the place where Ex-Arm reaches its peak. There are some shockingly hideous fight scenes in the show that literally break the laws of fucking physics. The character movements are unnatural even when they are just walking or shaking their heads, but it gets even worse when they are fighting. The anime also likes to use fog and shaky cams a lot during the fight scenes for some reason, and it looks awful. Surprisingly, the choreography isn&#039;t actually that bad, but why will it matter when everything else is completely unsalvageable?<br />
<br />
The character designs are originally pretty decent in the manga, but the anime downright butchers them. The 3D characters always look like they are having a stroke or something. As I mentioned earlier, their movements are unthinkably unnatural, and their faces are deprived of any emotion whatsoever—I get genuinely scared by looking at them sometimes. Occasionally, there are instances of attempting to convey emotions on the characters&#039; faces, but it just ends up looking even worse. And guess what? Even something as basic as lip flaps are messed up. Isn&#039;t this just amazing?<br />
<br />
Now, you might be thinking why I specifically said &quot;the 3D characters&quot;. Well, because there are some lovely looking 2D characters in this CGI anime as well, who continuously appear in the same scene as even lovelier looking 3D characters! How wonderful.<br />
<br />
This inevitably brings up the question: What led to the creation of such a gargantuan disaster?<br />
<br />
Apparently, the director of the anime, Yoshikatsu Kimura, is a live-action filmmaker who has never worked in anime before. Prior to being the director of Ex-Arm, he had no experience with animation whatsoever. So, this show was doomed right from the start. What&#039;s even worse, however, is that Kimura refused to work with people who are actually experienced in anime, and decided to retain his previous team who didn&#039;t have any experience with working in anime either. In addition, he spent most of his budget hiring stuntmen just to shoot motion capture, and thus had very little money left to do everything else.<br />
<br />
And as you would expect, a show that was doomed right from the start now became even worse. Much, much worse.<br />
<br />
This raises another question: How did Ex-Arm get the green light to begin with? It baffles me to think that everyone was perfectly fine with putting it on TV. I just can&#039;t imagine that anyone with half a brain and properly functioning eyes thought it was good idea to air this crap. There&#039;s literally not a single thing about the animation that deserves any sort of praise. It&#039;s objectively worthless. And still, a fair amount of money was spent (read: wasted) on making this show and it got released as an anime for thousands of other people to see. Bravo, Crunchyrolls!<br />
<br />
Okay, we get it. The production is pure garbage. But what about the story? What about the characters? Of course, to no one&#039;s surprise, Ex-Arm fails outstandingly there as well.<br />
<br />
As I said before, the concept of the series is actually interesting. It&#039;s a fairly unique take on the Sci-Fi genre. Given proper directing and execution, it could have been turned into something very compelling. But obviously, there isn&#039;t a slight hint of that in the anime. Due to the budget&#039;s ludicrous misuse, major corners are cut—I think &quot;major&quot; isn&#039;t nearly a strong enough word here. The anime basically takes everything good about the manga and completely gets rid of it.<br />
<br />
There is a story element in the manga that contributes to worldbuilding? Cut that out. There is a detailed monologue that adds more depth and characterization? Cut that out. There is a plot point that gives a better understanding of the story? Cut that out. There is a conversation between the characters that makes perfect sense? CUT. THAT. OUT. Make sure to cut as many corners as possible, even if it makes everything unbelievably stupid and nonsensical. We have to compensate for my brainless spending, you know?<br />
<br />
There is barely anything in Ex-Arm that could genuinely be called &quot;storytelling&quot; or &quot;narrative&quot;. It&#039;s one of those shows where a lot of things happen in every episode, but you don&#039;t have a single clue as to why and how they happen. Furthermore, it has some of the most mind-boggling plot twists I have ever seen in anime—mind-boggling for how stupid and predictable they are. Honestly, if the standards for writing are this low, I might as well be one of the greatest authors to ever exist. Hell, probably an online story generator could write something far better than this. And I repeat, it is entirely the fault of the adaptation. The story actually makes sense in the manga. Million times more sense than the anime, at least.<br />
<br />
Silence is powerful, but Ex-Arm takes that a bit too literally. Several action scenes, where something playing on the background is more than just necessary, are barren of any music. You can only hear the characters making awkward breathing and panting noises, and occasionally even worse, there aren&#039;t any noises. Everything is left completely, utterly silent. No tune, no melody, no sound effect, no breathing—no nothing whatsoever. Nothing but pure silence.<br />
<br />
Again, breaking the laws of physics is apparently child&#039;s play for the characters of Ex-Arm.<br />
<br />
The occasional sound effects and tracks used in the background are also meritless; saying they are &quot;uninspired&quot; and &quot;unoriginal&quot; would be using the words too lightly. The score is repetitive as hell; two or three tracks are played over and over again for the entirety of the show. The ending song is barely passable, but the opening song is awful and sounds like an amateur cover of a 2000s&#039; boyband song (though I gotta admit that I kinda started liking it ironically after a while).<br />
<br />
If there is one thing to praise Ex-Arm about, and I think it&#039;s quite literally the only thing, it will be the voice acting. Most voice actors of the show are actually very competent and have worked in various anime before, which is apparent through their performance. But as they say, you can&#039;t fix something that is already broken. And Ex-Arm is far more than broken—it&#039;s crumbled to the point of no return. So, despite the involvement of several talented seiyuu, there are more than hundreds of extremely awkward monologues and conversations because of the poor excuse of a script. Now imagine how many more there would be if there wasn&#039;t a cast of experienced voice actors.<br />
<br />
In terms of enjoyment, I have a sort of love-hate relationship with Ex-Arm. Occasionally, I was laughing my ass off because of all the wrong reasons; at other times, I was contemplating suicide. At first, everything about it was so laughably bad that I had a great time watching it, but the &quot;novelty&quot; wore off very quickly. It took only 3 episodes for the show to stop being funny for me, and it instead became very, very painful—and offensive—to watch. I might have even started losing my sanity at some point. At best, Ex-Arm is ironically funny; at worst, it&#039;s complete torture.<br />
<br />
In a way, Ex-Arm is truly ground-breaking. It breaks the limit of how atrocious the production quality in anime can be, and will go down in history as a fantastic example of what you absolutely should NOT do while animating a piece. Ex-Arm lacks even the most fundamental aspects of animation that make animation, well, animation. Despite having a decent source material at hand, it consists of a storyline that is sheer nonsense, and characters that rival cardboard cutouts in terms of dullness. It&#039;s irrefutable how marvelously bad it is.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, Ex-Arm is a disgrace for everyone. It&#039;s a disgrace for all the people who worked on it, it&#039;s a disgrace for all the people who spent money on it, it&#039;s a disgrace for the original creators who had to see their work get so badly butchered—it&#039;s a monumental failure in every regard.<br />
<br />
Calling Ex-Arm an anime is an insult to anime as a medium. It&#039;s just offensive. Utterly offensive.

    Where do I even begin with? <br />
<br />
This anime is a trainwreck and we are currently 4 episodes deep. I don&#039;t have to wait for the show to finish to know this is bad, like really bad, and the problem isn&#039;t necessarily the plot. The soundtrack isn&#039;t bad either, the opening is actually quite enjoyable. But the animation, oh the unholy animation.<br />
<br />
So, to begin with, they thought CGI would be the way to go, fair enough, bold decision but some animes managed to do it well..... But yeah they didn&#039;t. The characters look like they are traumatized, completely expressionless, they barely blink and their pupils are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377415">
        eternally stuck in place. At the same time, they use 2D animation just so the horrible CGI can really pop out. The visuals constantly glitch and most of the models float in mid-air for no good reason. Sometimes the animations even reset.<br />
<br />
It.Looks.Horrendous.<br />
<br />
Now for the MMD looking fight scenes. The choreography isn&#039;t horrible, just terribly mediocre. The characters are incredibly stiff and apparently possess the power to manipulate gravity. I had to watch the fight scenes in slow motion just to fully analyze the sh*tshow displayed in front of me. Some scenes are so ridiculous (Like the heli scene in episode 2) I feel like I might be having a stroke.<br />
<br />
Also... How did they get VA&#039;s like Ishikawa Yui and Uesaka Sumire (just to name a few) to voice act in this disaster... Like how?<br />
<br />
Honestly, this anime is awful in an appalling way, with asinine levels of animation and production. This thing only has a 2 and not a 1 on MAL because of the meme value; but look me in the eyes and tell me you didn&#039;t enjoy it, I dare you. It&#039;s that type of anime that is so incredibly bad, it&#039;s stupidly enjoyable. Kinda like The Room of anime, you know? After watching it with 2 friends of mine at 4 in the morning, I found myself laughing like an idiot. Maybe it&#039;s just a huge troll and we&#039;re all being fooled; maybe it&#039;s just bad, but if that&#039;s the case then f*ck me is it enjoyably bad. 10/10 for making me choke of laughter.<br />

    &quot;Hello, hello, I don&#039;t want to make it out of the fake.&quot; ~ Best Opening EVER !!!<br />
<br />
2019: Arifureta<br />
People: &quot;My God, this animation is the worst I have ever heard.&quot;<br />
2020: Gibiate<br />
People: &quot;They even managed to make the sound effects worse.&quot;<br />
2021: Ex-Arm<br />
People: &quot;OMG! I&#039;M BLEEDING THROUGH THE EYES&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Visual Flight&quot;, remember that name forever. It is the studio of Ex-Arm, one of the anime with one of the worst CG&#039;s that ever existed. In fact, the studio went further. But let&#039;s start with the best side of the show, its synopsis. Basically, Ex-Arm tells the story of a group of people who fight technological weapons called Ex-Arm (which

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387568">
        gives the show its name). Akira, our protagonist, is an Ex-Arm. He has a past where he was practically an unbeatable creature, while currently he doesn&#039;t remember what happened. Alma and Minami are the other protagonists of this series. Because Akira is an Ex-Arm in the shape of a brain and without a body, it is not very effective without being used by another robot. During the anime, Akira manages to be able to command Alma&#039;s robotic body, while both, together with the rest of the group, fight the impending evil.<br />
<br />
The Ex-Arm idea may seem interesting at first (and, in fact, it is). I honestly had good expectations for the show, but today I regret any chance I gave for this show. Ex-Arm is an offense, an anime that should make its producers ashamed of what they did. How can such a promising show receive a melancholy combination of character design, director and musical themes? The anime doesn&#039;t even hide that it&#039;s bad. He alone jokes and admits that it is one of the worst things that ever existed. Remember when I mentioned Arifureta and Gibiate at the beginning of this review? So, all the problems that these animes had made it seem that the animes are good.<br />
<br />
But I have to admit: Ex-Arm is so horrible, that watching it can be funny. Have you seen any fun videos of a game full of bugs and delays (Cyberpunk 2077, lol)? Ex-Arm was just like that for me. From the beginning I had already given up on the show and I was more careful to find disappointing scenes than to care about the story that Ex-Arm wants to tell, after all, who cares for a kiss simply made by fanservice (IS SERIOUS, EX-ARM HAS UNTIL FANSERVICE AS A COMPLETE TRASH). Honestly, Kimura Yoshikatsu, the show&#039;s director, did a job that he should be ashamed of. Not only did he lead a pre-said show to be one of the worst things that ever existed, he dishonored the original material. The manga, written by HiRock, is also not much superior. I don&#039;t particularly know what he really looks like, but I&#039;m pretty sure it can&#039;t have been worse than the anime. Such an adaptation must have depressed the original creator himself. Many were so astonished by the result of the show, that they gave solidarity to his profile, because there is no merit that this work exists.<br />
<br />
Some could defend Ex-Arm as a future trend in Japanese animation. I disagree. There is another show, from 2020, Aya to Majo, which is a film by the Ghibli studio, done entirely in CG. Anime isn&#039;t good when it comes to history, but it&#039;s visually great. Remember the current Disney movies? So, I compare Aya to Majo with these millionaire productions. It is clear that good CG&#039;s exist, and that some also have the same animation application with Ex-Arm, but even today I see no benefit in following this up. Generally, these shows have an extremely low financial budget (like &quot;Idolls!&quot;, For example), so it ends up being an urgent resource to put on a show that way.<br />
<br />
Finally, Ex-Arm is definitely the worst show of 2021 (when it comes to animation). There&#039;s nothing to save here, except for the songs and memes that it generated. The show is a rot, an announcement that Japanese anime faces serious financial problems in pleasing its own audience and foreigners. My condolences from HiRock, for having to go through this and I really hope that Visual Flight has some better destination than this show, because if I produce something like this again, I don&#039;t doubt that there is anything worse than that, honestly. An apocalypse? Well, Kaifuku is a hell of an experience. Ex-Arm is a divine punishment in our eyes.

    Hello Hello Anime of the Season? Anime of the Season. P.S. This is a poorly written review fitting for a poorly made anime. Goodbye Goodbye<br />
<br />
When the opening says “Hello hello” it greets you like a waiter at a 5 star restaurant who serves us. It understands its customers so well. Some of my favorite quotes by the waiter named Ex-Arm are: “Kiss for me.” and “That’s why you can spout this bullshit.” Brought to you by the beloved Crunchyroll, Ex-Arm is a 10/10 Crunchyroll Original with CGI you’ve never seen before! It is gr2.<br />
<br />
Instead of talking about something as trivial as story and character, I’m

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387552">
        just going to go Ex-Arm style with my review and break all conventions.<br />
<br />
Ex-Arm has all the Ds in the book: 3-D mannequin dolls at Old Navy, 2-D humans that move at 3 frames per second, 2.5-D characters with CG faces and their body parts drawn in, 1-D cardboard cut-outs, Natsume Akira’S D, you name it! Ex-Arm has got it all.<br />
<br />
Wii Fit Trainer looks better than all the characters designs and Wii Fit Trainer doesn’t even have a face. There are multiple action scenes where the robot girl tries to evade an attack and she does dive on the floor and her arms do a hangman pose while she seems to be doing the limbo under an imaginary pole. However, this isn’t any type of diving move. This is a slidey move that sweeps the floor cleaner than any mop I’ve used. That’s why I’ve decided to work with producers of Ex-Arm so you can get your own vacuum using the cheap price of Studio Visual Flight’s budget!<br />
<br />
Even after rewatching the 1st episode 3 times, I still don’t know the plot. I’ve honestly seen PS2 games with better 3-D fight scenes. It’s like the worst video game cutscene you’ve ever seen. Seriously though, I’ve seen 1994 Spider-Man clips that look better than Ex-Arm fights. Their action scenes are technically fluid but some of them are framed so bad it just looks like the camera just zooms in. The seiyuus can’t even scream correctly like that time the MC got kicked in the femur and the tibia; it sounded so much like moaning that I just started spontaneously laughing. It’s one of those iconic moments you can’t forget cause it’s so wrong. <br />
<br />
Surprisingly, considering their use of CG, a lot of the dialogue just involves them standing there and not doing anything with any facial Ex-pression changes. Actual robots show more emotion than these creatures. Their mouths have a 1-inch radius and they’re either smiling creepily like Ronald McDonald or frowning as hard as Miyazaki after he previewed the 1st episode. The constant use of dust when there is a fight scene makes it feel as if my computer needs a cleaning every time I watch. <br />
<br />
The constant flashes to a naked Natsume Akira to indicate his consciousness is laughably bad. It’s like they use a picture of the Big Bang and put his crotch as the centerpiece. You remember that big white glow in the movie Akira? That’s actually Natsume Akira’s crotch. It looks as bad as it sounds. To say the universe revolves around his crotch...well there is that random rom-com episode but they don’t go THAT far...I think? I feel like he is the reason why this anime is categorized in Ecchi when I’ve seen normal popular anime like MHA actually show more! The way the characters have partially 2-D body parts and 3-D faces sometimes always gets me laughing harder than actual comedies! When you see a character’s face shocked over someone’s ass getting whooped and you see their flat as paper hands,  you can’t help but spit take. (Tip for people watching: don’t drink anything until after you finish watching.) <br />
<br />
The constant clash of ugly character designs plus really bland or ‘norma’ backgrounds always causes my eyes to twitch. Sometimes, my entire face cringes. I kid you not; I have better ugly selfie pictures than their actual faces. The plot is a generic dystopia where the surviving MC and friends try to obtain god-like weapons that can destroy the world. The end fight is just as boring as you’d Ex-pect since the villain has no other motive than “Destroy! Destroy! DESTROY!! So much fun!!” The fact that such well-known seiyuus like Miyu Tomita are paired with these horrifyingly ugly and generic characters is so confusing. Heck, these seiyuus barely even promote Ex-Arm on their Twitter since it’s so trashy. Even Crunchyroll only posted once a week on their Twitter to let everyone know a new Ex-Arm episode was released. To say it’s a problem with the management is an understatement. The staff apparently has never had Ex-perience creating an anime before and the director has only worked in live action movies. It’s no wonder why when director Kimura Yoshikata said that we’ll get something we’ve never seen before, he was Ex-actly right!! If there’s a season 2 I’m definitely watching!! Ex-Arm is Ex-cellent.<br />

    The Plot/Story:<br />
The story is about our main Protagonist Akira. Akira tried to get isekai&#039;ed into a better anime but truck-Kun betrayed him and he was only comatose for 16 years. His brother, a genius S*x doll maker, makes his favourite doll from 16 years ago to save him, where it&#039;s revealed the main character is now just a DUMB BRAIN!<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Watched the trailer, thought it was going to be a fun time! *spoilers* it was not a fun time... Their animation team did an incredible job at inflicting physical pain to my eyes. Especially the scenes where they drew minor characters with 2d so the audience

        can also get a contrast between the terrible 3d, and the decent 2d. The advantages of 3d allow for more character expression but half the time, the characters look like this 0_0. Their final desperate attempt to sell the art was to please the degenerates and make two girls kiss… When your art style can’t make two girls kissing HOT! There’s no saving it…<br />

Sound:<br />
For a sci-fi show, I was expecting some Techno, bass, electric guitar, even dubstep if you are going cheap. But they went BOLD and paid $20 for someone to create an adobe flash game soundtrack for them! (I was joking but TURNS out that’s what they did…)<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Akira is your stand &quot;shonen&quot; protagonist and to explain how &quot;STANDARD&quot; he is I&#039;m going to describe his character study. <br />
He&#039;s a teenager who got himself into an undesirable situation where he finds himself powerless. But he then gains a special ability that allows him to overcome the situation. He must now refine that ability to protect him and his loved ones from future looming threats! <br />
How series combat the &quot;shonen&quot; protagonist syndrome is surrounding the main character with more interesting side characters where they&#039;re able to bounce their personalities with the MC. 0_0 is not a personality trait, but this series tries to convince you it is!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
This ruined my day...<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
I&#039;m not an alcoholic.... BUUUUUT watching this series has convinced me, to never watch it sober again. <br />

    Ah yes the most anticipated anime of the year. Ex-arm is one of a kind and if you watched it you will understand what I mean. The studio Visual Flight lives up to its name as the anime&#039;s visuals flew above anyone&#039;s expectations. And let us not forgot the story which idk who tf wrote but they wrote an exceptional story. The rating for ex-arm is deceiving as a lot of people came in expecting it to be dogshit (and they were not wrong) but if u come in open minded you will notice how unique and distinctive this anime is.

    I read the manga and to be honest it was a pretty good story, not the best but not the worst. It was above mediocre but not a masterpiece so, when i heard it was getting an anime adaption I was really excited.<br />
<br />
This was one of the most disappointing anime’s ever. The mix of 3D characters next to 2D characters just makes it so weird. The fight scenes are so static and stiff that it feels like your watching a fight scene in an old CG video game and even those were better.<br />
<br />
Mixing 3D and 2D animation can make amazing works such as Beastars, which

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376917">
        used 3D animation and then 2D to put emphasis on different parts of the story. But here, it just wasn’t good at all. I couldn’t even focus on reading the subtitles because i thought i was going insane seeing a 2D and 3D character. I have nothing against 3D and i’ve watched plenty of 3D anime such as Ajin, Knights of Sidonia, and Blame!, but other than that i’ve yet to see any really well done 3D anime and don’t get me wrong those aren’t the best either.<br />
<br />
This anime would have been so much better if it had fallen into the hands of a different studio that either knew how to do 3D animation well or just made it in 2D. Overall the anime was just a shit show with bad animation, bad directing, and bad sound design. I only give it a 3/10 because of the story.

    HELLO HELLO! I don&#039;t want to make it all the fake~~~<br />
<br />
&quot;Declaring war against all of the SF series around the world!&quot;? More like declaring victory at being the WORST show ever to grace anime since Berserk 2016 and Gibiate, fuck, even RWBY Season 1 looks better than this fucking abomination.<br />
<br />
Here we go again, the battle for the &quot;Best of the Best and Worst&quot; of the season, and Winter 2021 proves it all one and the same. What is Wonder Egg Priority? What is Re:Zero? What EVEN is Attack on Titan? Nope...the best show of the season goes to Ex-Arm, the one and only show you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387559">
        SHOULD watch at the behest of everyone who deems those shows masterpieces! And who are we to thank for this project? Well, a studio production team that does C-grade live-action productions that NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THEM ever had an inkling of knowledge of how to make anime, making this modern abomination like the trash that it is. Plus, I&#039;d like to take this time to segue and thank our great sponsor: Crunchyroll! You guys have done a SUPERB job at shooting yourselves on the foot once again, damn son! You and your originals sure know how to make modern classic masterpieces in the making! Not only are the people in the West complaining, but even people in Japan are deeming it as &quot;令和史上最強のアニメが爆誕しました&quot; (or The strongest anime in the history of Reiwa (Japan) was born). Man, have we as the audience of the anime community not have our pair of eyes wrecked to oblivion, or have companies strapped cash ready to slap them on our faces?<br />
<br />
Heck, I&#039;ll just raise awareness through these videos (full credits to them):<br />
&quot;How Not To Make An Anime (What Went Wrong With Crunchyroll&#039;s EX-ARM) | Animator Spotlight&quot; by The Canipa Effect<br />
&quot;There is NO precedent for Ex-Arm. They had the money to bring in well-known VAs and en entire stunt team, but it didn&#039;t make the show any better. NONE OF THIS WAS A FREAK ACCIDENT. You can&#039;t blame COVID for the whole thing. And the blame lies squarely on the leadership.&quot; - Canipa<br />
<br />
&quot;How The WORST Anime Ever Made Was Made | Ex-Arm&quot; by Browntable<br />
&quot;So these people got a shit-ton of $$$, and that&#039;s...what they put out? That&#039;s disappointing to me. So yeah, that&#039;s Ex-Arm, and uh...THAT&#039;S PAIN.&quot;<br />

&quot;It is...HILARIOUS (laughter).&quot; - The Anime Man<br />
&quot;It is...an EXPERIENCE, I would say. So that I think we have literally got the Mass Effect: Andromeda releases of anime, if you know what I mean?&quot; - Gigguk<br />

&quot;The HOTTEST EX-Quisite TRASH Anime of Winter 2021&quot; by Mother&#039;s Basement<br />
&quot;This is the kind of violent mess that you just can&#039;t lO.Ok away from, angles so tangled they verge on non-euclidian. It LINGERS in your eye even after you pull your meat ones away, taunting you to imagine how ANY human being, could fuck ANYTHING up in this many ways, THIS BADLY at the same time. Even Gibiate and GoHands shows aren&#039;t physically pain to watch any more.&quot; - Geoff Thew, professional shitbag<br />
<br />
To be fair, let&#039;s break this classic modern masterpiece in the making shall we?<br />
<br />
Story (from Wikipedia/MAL, re-arranged in style, because I don&#039;t care):<br />
&quot;2014: Akira Natsume seems to almost have a phobia of electrical devices while also being very good at diagnosing them. He resolves to change himself for the better and get a girlfriend like his older brother did. But then suddenly, static Truck-kun sends him towards his death!<br />
2030: A special policewoman Minami and her Android partner Alma retrieve and activate a highly advanced AI and superweapon called EX-ARM and put it into full control of their ship as a last resort. Turns out the AI is actually just Akira&#039;s brain!<br />
<br />
There! Easy to diagnose isn&#039;t it? I feel pretty bad for both author HiRock and illustrator Komi Shinya, both these people DO NOT deserve to have their work translate into this disastrous atrocity, but at least the plot made made sense into yet another illustration of an post-apocalyptic time-travelling Isekai to stop evil from suppression of the world...in Sony Vegas Pro effects of culminating dark lightning balls and screen shaking effects. The story isn&#039;t bad, to be honest, in fact it&#039;s a decent one.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Who gives a shit when characters aren&#039;t drawn and motion-captured very well? From Akira to Minami and everyone else, you have great VAs backing you up, but the stiff 3D just isn&#039;t enough to salvage your character performance! Mouth flaps up and down with no expression, it just honestly makes it dull to watch them get shocked and happy without some expression. What a shame.<br />
<br />
Visual (Flight) Animation:<br />
BE TRUTHFUL, you know what you came here for after watching the trailer (which is the OP itself). Never in the history of the 2020s have we seen the &quot;Best of the Best&quot; masterpieces of the opposite spectrum, and from Visual Flight to director Yoshikatsu Kimura and his &quot;The Expendables&quot; team that doesn&#039;t even know how to make an anime, from the homophobic same-sex kiss from poor CGI to 2D and 3DCG characters meshing in the same panels, piss off. You guys may have done some parts of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, but that doesn&#039;t mean that you have the right to say that y&#039;all are given the greenlight to do something like this, what a waste of money that&#039;s spent badly.<br />
<br />
Music: HELLO！HELLO！<br />
Anime: HELP！HELP！<br />
Honestly, this shit ROCKS HARD so much I&#039;m banging my head with the music. Forget about Dizzy Sunfist&#039;s ED &quot;Diamond Shine&quot;, I would like to coin the music on a diamond platter that says: When The OP Is Way Better Than The Anime Itself. Heck, checking out AIRFLIP&#039;s MV on YouTube, with each and every comment getting a heart surely means something, can it? CAN IT? So AIRFLIP, Rise Again and make your song well-known!<br />
&quot;They even got my favorite 2000&#039;s rockband. Blink-183&quot; - Gigguk<br />
<br />
If there is a takeaway from anyone AND everyone reading this hilariously dumb-fuck of a review, Canipa sums up well: <br />
&quot;If there&#039;s a lesson to be learnt from this, it&#039;s this: Executives and producers at these companies NEED to have a working understanding of how anime is made. And not just the process, but the conditions as well.&quot; <br />
<br />
HELLO HELLO! We still fight together!<br />
No matter how I&#039;m feeling lonesomeness again~<br />
HELLO HELLO! We stand together!<br />
No matter how deep I am in sadness again~<br />
My soul will not give up...because I&#039;m still alive...TODAY!<br />
<br />
HELLO HELLO...no more Crunchyroll Originals please. Sink into oblivion to those who funded this monstrosity. It&#039;s cancerous in the most hilarious way possible, and I&#039;ve enjoyed my time here from start to finish.

    Ex-Arm.<br />
This &quot;anime&quot; is, to put it mildly, revolutionary. It captivated many hearts, gave birth to new dreams, and restored the hopes of people all around the world.<br />
My own experience with Ex-Arm has been quite emotional. As I continue to compose this sorry review, numerous tears pour down my face and onto my keyboard. I&#039;d already used up the four tissue boxes during last night&#039;s &quot;enlightenment session&quot; (you know what I mean), so I resorted to wearing my T-shirt and sleeves instead.<br />
&quot;But why is this particular Anime having such an effect on me?&quot; you may ask. Well, it already has a huge impact on everyone who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418890">
        finished this anime, but my case is rather unique.<br />
You see, I&#039;ve been diagnosed with Stage 7 cancer, which isn&#039;t even possible. But after watching this anime, and this may be hard to believe, I genuinely felt as if I had been healed of this dreadful sickness. I informed the nurse that I was feeling much better and that I was overjoyed at the prospect of having hair again. When they tested me and took a look at the results, I could see the biggest shocked expressions on their face. <br />
But...<br />
They informed me that my Stage 7 cancer had been eradicated, but it was due to a heartbreaking fact. After Ex-Arm was completed, it DID cure my cancer, but it did so by ultimately diagnosing me with a far more potent disease, even more, deadly than Stage 7. It killed that disease, but now I&#039;m infected with a far more lethal one, and now I am given the chance to name this &quot;new disease.&quot;<br />
According to the Doctor&#039;s, I only have 12 days to live until I eventually die. My family members came all to my behest and cried with me as well. Though, worry not, I specially requested my older brother to throw my computer and gadgets all down a well, eradicating my search history forever.<br />
This concludes my review of Ex-Arm.<br />
10/10 Story<br />
10/10 Art<br />
10/10 Sound<br />
10/10 Character<br />
10/10 Enjoyment<br />
-100/10 Real Life Influence<br />
Verdict: Well fuck I&#039;m dead.

    WARNING! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS ABOUT HOW BAD THE ANIMATION IS!<br />
<br />
So I did a thing which every human on this planet would consider a fate worse than death: Watching &quot;ExArm&quot;. In this review I&#039;ll mostly talk about the animation because let&#039;s be honest: That&#039;s the only reason this anime stood out in the first place.<br />
<br />
Also, one thing before getting into this review. You know when you try to do something for the first time, but you&#039;re kinda unsure about it because you know it&#039;ll most likely be bad, but then your mom or friend says something like &quot;Well it surely won&#039;t be the worst in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376970">
        the world&quot;?. Well, ExArm is VisualFlight&#039;s first work and it&#039;s also the lowest rated anime series on MAL (excluding 4 others that are only 1 episode so I don&#039;t take them into consideration). Yup, think about that the next time you try something new (But as long as you have an IQ of above -5 you&#039;ll be fine I guess)<br />
<br />
Story and Characters - 1/10<br />
<br />
It&#039;s just bad, I don&#039;t know what else to say. It feels like the author decided to take Ajin and make it a SF so yeah that&#039;s what this abomination of a show feels like. The characters feel so generic (plus their design is terrible) and they don&#039;t show any visual emotions (There&#039;s a scene where a girl is getting choked and for some reason, she smiles?!! Like what???). And the eyes of the main character. OH GOD, THE EYES. It feels like they&#039;re staring straight into your soul. I&#039;m pretty sure that I&#039;ll have trouble sleeping from now on. Thanks, Crunchyroll!<br />
<br />
Music - 4/10<br />
<br />
Since the main attraction was the animation, I didn&#039;t pay too much attention to the music. But I&#039;ll say this: It feels that they went on the Unity asset store and grabbed whatever SF music pack was cheaper. Also, I feel bad for the artists that made the op and ed because they&#039;re not as bad as the rest of the show. So yeah 4/10<br />
<br />
Animation - 1/100<br />
<br />
Ah, yes, the moment that you&#039;ve all been waiting for. So, no surprise, the animation was just as bad as the trailer. It feels like they took some scenes out of Metal Gear Solid on the ps1 and took out 99% of the animation keyframes and rendered them at 1080p. Ok, I&#039;m sorry I compared this to MGS, MGS didn&#039;t deserve it.<br />
<br />
The animations are really wacky and I found myself either cringing at them or laughing out loud. This is worse than youtube 3d animations. Like c&#039;mon. Especially when you realize that some people in a room looked at this and said: &quot;Yep this is good&quot;. I can&#039;t think of anyone who would willingly watch this (except maybe for people that think The Big Bang Theory is funny).<br />
<br />
So you know when CGI anime has some characters that appear for a few seconds so they draw them by hand? Well, this also being CGI they did the same thing and it looks SO WEIRD because you can clearly tell. Like, there&#039;s a scene where the main character is in the same shot as his brother (which is 2d btw) and it feels like you&#039;re watching Gumball but the Japanese knock-off of the Chinese knock-off of the original show. The 2 characters also had different shading. The point is, that scene made me really uncomfortable. Like REALLY uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
I feel bad even for the animators because they had to review their scenes so therefore they had to watch it multiple times. I don&#039;t know anything about VisualFlight, but I don&#039;t think the animators are to blame though. The anime industry is known to underpay their workers so maybe the animators just put in an effort equal to their payment. Maybe.<br />
<br />
Besides the animation, well not much to say. So I&#039;ll say it again:<br />
<br />
animation bad CGI bad story bad stop it<br />
<br />
also this is my first ever review so yeah, nice choice me<br />
<br />
Overall -anime bad 1/9000<br />

    For hundreds of thousands of years man has searched for something that is perfection and has failed to find it...until now in the form of Ex arm.<br />
<br />
Ex arm is a beauty only a few will understand to just how complicated it is , it makes a complicated anime like serial experiments lain look like your typical spongebob episode. The amount of work and care put into the anime is shown vividly in the form of its story, characters , sound track and of course, animation.<br />
 The story of ex arm is something that is so deep that even 10 paragraphs wouldnt be able to comphrehend

          <span style="display: none;" id="review389524">
        and if one were to comphrehend it less than that then he or she isnt a true anime fan and should be burned by kpop stans, each second of ex arm shows so much symbolism like the characters designs,their environments, the environements have as much detail as the maps of PUBG so you know its truly something beautiful.<br />
<br />
The sound track of ex arm puts legendary composers like shoji meguro, hiroyuki sawano and yoko shimomura to shame, every sound track made me cry like there was no tommorrow and if there was a tommorrow it would be one where i could again cry seeing another episode of ex arm. <br />
<br />
The characters in ex arm have the most thought provoking back stories and arcs, their facial expressions were enough to incapsulate all the emotions they felt, it felt so real that i felt like real human expressions were fake it was like the real facial expressions had &quot;one bone in their face that moved it without no change in face&quot;, its truly the peak of anime faces and nothing can beat it.<br />
<br />
And now we come to the greatest part of  Ex arm the animation, seeing the animation was truly a breathtaking experience it was greater than the likes of Skelter Heaven, made anime like the fate adaptions from studio ufotable look like those indian cartoons you see on TV, it was truly magnificent, an artistry that would make picasso piss in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Finally we come to the ending of Ex arm which truly cemented it as the Greatest anime of all time, in its trailer it said its declaring war on sci fi anime, but what people failed to realize was that it was obviously a false understatement for it truly declared war and conquered said war on every single anime that has ever created, the ending has made every anime i have ever watched go from a 10 to a negative 1. Praise this masterpiece and beg that we get more like this. I didnt complete  this art, the art completed me.

    Best anime I have ever seen. <br />
The animation was so good, I&#039;m still flabbergasted, truely a masterpiece. I have been watching anime for 69 years now and it is the best thing ever created. Thanks god for this and thanks mom for giving birth to me so I could watch this masterpiece.<br />
STORY: 10<br />
<br />
EX Arm plot and world-building are some of its strongest aspects. The world that it creates is an immersive, full-feeling thing with many animate pieces that move even when you aren&#039;t looking at them. It&#039;s an extremely creative world as well, adopting its own set of universal laws including alchemy through equivalent exchange,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review391073">
        mind-body duality and its own interpretation of a higher power, and it sticks by these laws. Never once does the story contradict its own rules, instead using them in creative ways to build off of each other. The plot is also one of the most engaging parts of the show, unveiling itself at just the right pace to keep you interested whilst still keeping a few major cards to play at the very end. The pieces fall into place in a way that is satisfying because it simultaneously mind-blowing and obvious, and that&#039;s one of the marks of strong storytelling.<br />
<br />
While the Ex Arm story is certainly one of the best I&#039;ve seen, I find that I have to withhold my 10 score here on the grounds that its incredible direction and creativity are marred by some detrimental weaknesses. First of all, the exposition is handled extremely poorly. The first and third episodes feel like they&#039;re from some shitty cartoon network show, the show blatantly ignores the show-don&#039;t-tell rule in the entirety of its first chunk (with characters spelling out exactly what is happening and why it&#039;s happening) and its tendency to repeat important plot points over and over again quite frankly feels insulting to me as the audience as though the show is assuming I&#039;m not able to pay attention or figure things out for myself and need to have the fact that Ed and Al committed the sin of human transmutation and lost their bodies told to me at least twenty-five times in the first two hours of show. Secondly, there&#039;s a period of time which I would probably refer to as the third fourth of the show (episodes 40-53ish) in which the show drags incredibly, adopting a typical battle-shonen approach of having characters engage in multiple-episode long one-on-one or two-on-one battles, giving them plenty of time to pose and stand off and monologue at each other. This isn&#039;t how fighting or war works, and these contrived battles really take away a lot of the climactic atmosphere. Finally, the show&#039;s ending is not nearly as satisfying as I wish it had been. The final few episodes are for the most part brilliant, but once the show plays all its cards and it&#039;s resolution time, it wraps itself up with cliches and in-your-face themes.<br />
<br />
ART: 11<br />
<br />
The art is absolutely astounding 80% of the time and absolutely horrid 20% of the time. Thus the 8 score. The action is all stunning, the openings gorgeous, the backgrounds consistent and unique, building a sense of a real lived-in world. The character designs are sometimes a little bland, but for the most part they are memorable and the homunculi look brilliant so I don&#039;t have any real complaints there.<br />
<br />
What I have a problem with is the obnoxious number of times that the show goes &quot;anime&quot; - reducing its characters to shittily-drawn caricatures and its animation to blocky, looped motion. Usually this is used during the shows attempts at humor, which I&#039;ll talk about later, but most of the time it was just extremely cringe-inducing and distracting, ruining the sense of continuity and immersion in this world. The show obviously wants you to take it seriously (it sure loves its drama) and when Al is portrayed as a big grey mound with a squiggle for a mouth it makes this difficult. There&#039;s a difference between having your character goof around and having the show itself goof around. It almost feels like a laugh-track, telling the audience &quot;this is the funny part!&quot;<br />
<br />
For the most part, however, the art is gorgeous. When it counts, it shines, and that&#039;s really what matters.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 10<br />
<br />
Undeniably the strongest aspect of the show. I have no complaints whatsoever. The soundtrack is never distracting but always effective, the voice-actors (especially for Bradley and Al) absolutely nailed it and the openings and endings... dear lord. It&#039;s been said before, but the openings and endings to EX Arm are some of the very best ever made, both in sound and visuals. They tell small stories of their own. They set the tone for the episode and for their section of the show as a whole. I especially loved &#039;Golden Time Lover&#039; and &#039;Chemistry&#039;, but I have to give special mention to SID&#039;s &#039;Rain&#039;. As far as I&#039;m concerned, that opening could have been the end of the show. It single-handedly established a sense of finality, a long-endured struggle of these characters and their causes. Everyone is portrayed as exhausted, weak and full of both despair and determination: protagonist and antagonist alike, fighting under the rain. Not for glory, not for honor, but just for the one thing they care most for. Personally, it made me extremely hyped for the final stretch of the show. It wasn&#039;t quite what we got, but at least we got some of it.<br />
<br />
I believe that there is an intense connection between a show&#039;s opening and the audience&#039;s willingness to appreciate it. It is very likely that the intensity of many fanbases is in part due to the ability that openings such as these have to maintain feelings in regards to the show, oftentimes perhaps even distorting or altering memories of the show itself into what the opening would have you believe the show was like rather than what it was actually like. Obvious examples that jump to mind are Sword Art Online&#039;s &quot;Courage&quot; and Guilty Crown&#039;s &quot;My Dearest&quot;. Remember how those shows were absolutely nothing like that? No?? IT&#039;S TOO LATE FOR YOU<br />
<br />
But I digress.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 10<br />
<br />
I would definitely call out the show&#039;s characters on being the weakest link and the most undeserving of the praise that the show receives. For starters, the writing is often clunky and awkward, but that&#039;s not the main issue. It&#039;s because most of them are not really characters: they&#039;re plot devices with one or two distinguishing traits tacked on. They&#039;re entirely predictable, not because they feel like real people but because they do the same things over and over again. Al talks about what he&#039;ll do when he gets his body back. Ed talks about how they&#039;ll find a way and how they will atone for their mistakes and etc. It&#039;s not that it&#039;s melodrama: it&#039;s the fact that it&#039;s the SAME melodrama over and over again. It wasn&#039;t until sometime past episode 30 that Ed stopped sounding perpetually like a broken record and started to feel as though he were actually developing, but even then he was really just defined by his arc and not by any amount of complexity.<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s the pitfall that so many of these characters fall into. If your character&#039;s only real traits beyond their development for the sake of the show are &quot;hates being called short&quot; and &quot;hates milk&quot; they&#039;re really more of a tool with some googly eyes stuck on to them. Other characters are even worse: Armstrong is manly. His sister is more manly. Mustang wants to be Fuhrer and avenge Hughes (he&#039;s even got this great relationship with Hawkeye that could have been seriously compelling if they ever had any real conversations about anything besides &quot;we must overthrow the government&quot; and &quot;Hughes!&quot; over and over again). Winry likes Ed and automail. Ling wants to be emperor. Now, Ex Arm is a complex, busy show. I could understand if it didn&#039;t have the time to make these characters anything more than chess pieces for its grand and elaborate plot, giving them a few distinguishing traits because that&#039;s really all it can manage without dragging itself out immensely. But it DOES have the time: it has all the time it spends having Ed yell about being called short. It has all the time it spends having Armstrong pull of his shirt and yell about being manly. It has all the time it spends having Ed and Al talk about getting their goddamn bodies back over and fucking over again as though I would somehow manage to forget it. Ling passing out from lack of food. May fawning comically over Ed. Mustang is antisocial LOL. The same gags, over and over again, barely even rehashed in any original way. Not only do they become painful to watch, they devour all of the development that this shallow cast of characters could have had to make me actually invested in them. They&#039;re far too static, with most of them having a single change or revelation over the course of the show&#039;s 64 episodes in order to indicate that they have grown as a person. But a good character has so much more than that: what kind of music do these people listen to? Why? Who are their role models? Why? What books do they like? What are their favorite places to eat? What do they appreciate in the people they&#039;re close to?? What are their personal histories...<br />
<br />
Oh wait, sorry! I didn&#039;t mean to ask that last one! Please, I take it back! NOOOOOOO...<br />
<br />
Yeah so I forgot to mention something. Screw all that stuff about making these characters possess complex personalities, EX Arm has a better way to define them.<br />
<br />
TRAUMA<br />
<br />
Everyone who&#039;s remotely relevant has a traumatic backstory. It&#039;s a harsh world, sure. I get that. Here&#039;s the issue: people are introduced and then defined through their trauma. Now this isn&#039;t Angel Beats bad, where horrible things happen to perfectly innocent people for no reason. Most of the tragedy is partially a result of the decisions of the characters involved, and their resulting struggle is a combination of having to cope with the consequences and with themselves and their mistakes. However, this cannot be used as a SUBSTITUTE for character development. A supplement, sure, but I still remember in episode four when Ed and Al meet a state alchemist who literally introduces himself with something along the lines of &quot;my wife left me because we were too poor&quot; before he even tells them his goddamn NAME. Here, come on in! Take a seat! Would you like some sorrow pie or tragic backstory cake? We have plenty! Ed and Al&#039;s dad left, then their mom died, then they f*cking ripped their bodies apart. Winry&#039;s parents were murdered in cold blood. Mustang had to kill lots of people. Armstrong had to kill lots of people. Everyone had to kill lots of people. Scar watched everyone he loved get killed, and then had to kill lots of people. These are always the first things we find out about people, and then for the rest of the show they are defined almost exclusively by them. If anyone is overly happy and wholesome, it means something horrid is going to happen to them. It&#039;s basic emotional manipulation. Look at this adorable little girl and her dog! Dead. Look at this smiling, picturesque family! Husband dead. Dead. Everyone innocuously happy has to die or lose someone close to them. The more broken and internally conflicted you are, the safer you are. There&#039;s no need to pile more grief on Scar, so he&#039;s relatively safe.<br />
<br />
Yes, the characters suffer from repeatable and preventable problems. They exist mainly to function as morals-in-a-bottle with gags tacked on to them. They&#039;re difficult to relate to, because all we know about them is whatever themes they embody and one or two dumb jokes. Ikuhara writes characters more personable than this, and his stories don&#039;t make sense on PURPOSE. I did give the characters a 6 though, and there are reasons for that.<br />
<br />
First off, despite their lack of humanization the characters complete their tasks of being walking themes with relative effectiveness. This isn&#039;t anywhere near Log Horizon S1 bad. These characters are here for a reason, they represent something, and they represent those things well. Sure, they could have easily been better, but they fulfill their purpose and for that alone they are not failures. I will also give special mention to Scar, who, while still actively defined by his trauma was executed far more impressively than the other characters. This is probably in part because the show actually viewed him as morally ambiguous as opposed to just making the character FEEL morally ambiguous when there was really no doubt that the show wanted you to think this was a &#039;good guy&#039; (*cough* Mustang)<br />
<br />
Second off, there are some exceptions to the rule. Most of my complaints thusfar have been leveled at the shows protagonists. They are the ones that suffer from dismal repetition and blatant violation of show-don&#039;t-tell. Where the show does excel is with its antagonists. There are seven homunculi in the show, incarnations of the seven deadly sins, and they so utterly clobber their &quot;good-guy&quot; counterparts in terms of being engaging, personable subtle characters that it isn&#039;t even funny. Their intensive backstories are never shoved in your face, their apparent contradictions are given plenty of time to be uncovered by the viewer, and the deliciously ironic conclusions to their arcs are done tactfully. Many times I found myself actively routing for them because they were just so much more interesting and well-executed. I would happily watch an &quot;Adventures of the Homunculus&quot; spinoff cataloging the several hundred years most of them lived before the start of the series.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 10<br />
<br />
I was constantly gripped by the plot. I actively looked forward to the openings and endings. The art was oftentimes orgasmic. The homunculi made me want to start looking for ingredients to make a philosopher&#039;s stone with. However, I was constantly frustrated by the show&#039;s apparent lack of respect for its viewers and by its absolutely abysmal humor. I&#039;ve already said it, but I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ve driven home just how infuriating it is to have exposition repeated to you over and f*cking over again and how cringe-inducing it is when somebody violates the show-don&#039;t-tell rule at extremely tense and crucial moments. It actively snapped me out of the experience whenever Ed and Al had a conversation about getting their bodies back after the 5th time it happened, and when God literally spelled out for Ed that he had discovered the meaning of life I facepalmed hard. That&#039;s not how you do themes, man. That just comes off as preachy. That&#039;s something the show suffered constantly from: it felt incredibly preachy. It&#039;s character&#039;s speeches about the answers they had found to their struggles felt much more pointed at the audience than at anyone in the show they were talking to, and that bothered the ever-loving crap out of me. And have I mentioned the humor? For every joke the show has that lands, it tries about five others that fall on their face. As I&#039;ve already mentioned, they&#039;re repetitive and used as a substitute for meaningful character interactions and development. It seems as thought the show is trying to use them as a counterbalance for its immense amount of melodrama, but instead they end up just ripping apart the tone and stagnating the story. Despite these gripes, I did overall enjoy the experience and felt that the positives did inevitably outweigh the negatives so I will happily give it a 7 for enjoyment.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 10<br />
<br />
EX Arm is not a masterpiece. It&#039;s a very respectable, unique, inspired and creative show and it&#039;s definitely a classic. I would happily recommend this to most people. However, don&#039;t go in with irrational expectations. It&#039;s enjoyable, it&#039;s engaging, it will definitely give you plenty to think about, but in my personal opinion it gets a little too much praise and a little too much hype. I probably would have enjoyed it more myself if I hadn&#039;t heard nothing but angelic worship for it before going into it. I formally apologize to any huge fans of the show that I may have offended: it&#039;s not by any means a bad show! I don&#039;t give out 7s all that lightly, believe me. This is merely an argument against EX Arm being the be-all-end-all of anime. Thanks for reading if you made it through that wall of text, and have a nice day!

    I know what you are thinking. &#039;They are giving Ex-Arm a three!? Are they mad?!&#039; Yeah, because there are reasons why this isn&#039;t a total shit show, but it&#039;s defo not a great thing by any means. Let me explain.<br />
<br />
The story is actually one of the more interesting things the show has. Following the mystery of the MC of that he goes from a normal school boy, to now knowing he was responsible for a drastic event that majorly effected mankind. But he has no idea of what happened, or how. To then being placed in these creations called Ex-Arms. Ex-Arms can range from stand

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376900">
        alone tech, to advancements. Think CyberPunk in a way, which kind fits considering both are broken messes haha. But it does have an interest there of what other versions are there.<br />
<br />
The story follows our MC in his new position, joining a group of people, and going off on missions, while avoiding certain types of people whom want to capture him and maybe either study him, or destroy him so he can pay for his crimes. I do feel like if this had a better direction, and style, it would be a far better received show. Even if the writing is a bit mixed.<br />
<br />
As for the characters themselves, they are a weird bunch in some regard. The MC seems like a typical guy, that&#039;s nice, though you wonder what on earth happened. While the AI that he can sometimes merge with, has a more serious persona, and like android fashion, can come off as stoic at times, and just diving right into things. But got a good head on her shoulders.<br />
<br />
Art: Oh boy....Lmao. While I&#039;m not the biggest &#039;UGH THIS UGLY&#039; whenever this kind is in anime, but it just looks real weird to look at at times. Makes it more out of place when there is actual normal anime looking people next to them sometimes. It&#039;s real bizarre to see sometimes. Much like to look at for that matter.<br />
<br />
The sound is fairly decent, hell the OP and ED are strange, as it&#039;s very unfitting to the show it is presenting. But they are good hits for what they are.<br />
<br />
Should you watch Ex-Arm? Sure, why not lol. It&#039;s gonna be one of the most talked about series as it goes along, for all the wrong reasons. So strap yourself in for a ride.

    I’ve seen over 600 anime and this is the first 1/10 I’m giving. This is pure garbage. It’s so bad it gave me cancer. A kindergartner with 1 day experience in Blender could make a better anime.<br />
The CG is actually on the level of PS2 graphics and it is haphazardly mixed with 2D animation in such a jarring way that it gives you a headache.<br />
With 4 episodes currently available and the poor quality being consistent throughout it is obvious that this wasn’t just an isolated issue with some scenes or a particular episode, like what happened with the most recent Seven Deadly Sins seasons, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review379201">
        rather a systemic problem with the entire production of the show.<br />
Seriously, I don’t know how this got made, how it passed quality control (if there was any), how it got approved to stream after being delivered to Crunchyroll in this state. Everyone involved in this project should be embarrassed and not be anywhere near anime production in the future.<br />
I have nothing more to say about this horrible show, don’t waste your precious time watching a single minute of this travesty.

    At this point, sarcasm about this being the best anime ever has been overdone. I’m just going to say it right away, Ex-Arm is one of, if not the worst anime ever. The fact that this was made by people who have never worked in this industry is not surprising at all. <br />
<br />
Manga vs Anime: I feel so bad for the mangaka (For the art, apparently the story is really awful. Like, it&#039;s ecchi so you shouldn&#039;t expect much, but coupled with being a terrible science fiction anime, it has a lot of deeply rooted problems rooting from nationalism). Imagine dedicating all of your effort

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387602">
        into this little project, and being excited to see that it will be animated. And then you see this as the finished product. The ad break art is done by him and it makes you wonder what could have been.<br />
<br />
Animation/Art: 1/10<br />
Do I even need to explain why the animation is so awful? Forgetting about how many times they’ve reused awful animation throughout the show, the way they use CGI is fundamentally wrong. Even if you don’t understand how it should be used, you are bound to notice immediately.<br />
The character designs are a joke, especially with how aesthetic the manga looks. The eyelashes and hair are literally just plastic, and the faces make absolutely no emotion.<br />
Also, for some reason, they have a habit of mixing CGI and 2D designs together. If a character isn&#039;t relevant, they aren&#039;t done in CGI. This leads them to looking like cardboard cutouts. <br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
The music almost never fits the scene, and honestly just blends in with the fever dream experience perfectly.<br />
As bad as I feel for the mangaka, I can’t help but feel even worse for the voice actors. I can’t believe how they managed to get so many talented and well known voice actors such as Daisuke Namikawa and Yui Ishikawa into this trainwreck. They really are doing their best, but there is only so much you can do with such a terrible script. <br />
Opening/Ending: The opening is a meme and the character designs aren’t even the same in it. The ending shows what the show could have looked like if they knew how to animate.<br />
<br />
Story: 1/10<br />
What story? I genuinely had no idea what was going on throughout the whole ordeal. They just threw words around and expected us to grasp the concepts. <br />
<br />
Characters: 2/10<br />
Akira is obnoxious, Alma is the badass, and Minami smiles. That&#039;s it folks. The most interesting part of the characters is realizing who voices them. <br />
<br />
Impact: This is going down in history as one of the worst anime ever for sure with at least bad anime connoisseurs, but it&#039;ll probably just be forgotten with time. This definitely solidifies the infamous reputation of Crunchyroll&#039;s masterpieces. <br />
<br />
Overall rating: 1/10. Seriously. I can&#039;t wait for the next Crunchyroll original anime. <br />

    I am writing this review because honestly this series should have a rating around. 6.7 and 7,1. Not 2.17! The story is really great and has me hooked. Models used for animation are really detailed and pretty. The animation itself is sometimes rough and it is noticeable where the new animation changes as the characters change pose straight to the next animation. I have seen six episodes thus far and prefer this to the generic shonen-series that have every girl drooling over the mc-yet no advancements happen on that front after the first episode. To name one from this season: Suppose the last dungeon boy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review379969">
        went to starter town.<br />
<br />
Story:     8<br />
It has me hooked. The story is refreshing. Unlike many other stories, this one doesn&#039;t have a side romance story, but mainly focuses on what is actually going on. Story so far is in 2014 the mc got truck-kun&#039;d and went in coma. 2020 everything went to crap in Japan and in year 2030 the mc wakes up after getting picked up by police as a weapon. He then starts helping the police to find other weapons of same kind as he is.<br />
<br />
Art:        6<br />
Please don&#039;t be fooled. Art is really pretty, but the sometimes jerky animation really deducts it&#039;s points. It is in fact 3D animated, but I actually like that. It is not near Land of the Lustrous finesse but spiritually feels closer to 1st volume of RWBY or Red vs Blue.<br />
Models: 10. Really pretty, polished and well done.<br />
Animation: 5.5. Made in a rush similar to school project you had known about for 2 weeks but started the night before deadline. In the chilled out scenes I haven&#039;t noticed anything too out of ordinary but when there are a lot of changing camera-angles and rapid animations sometimes things look like there wasn&#039;t enough time for all the animations to get polished and jumpy cuts between movements had to be made. There are also some effects that are missing fade-in-out or easy-in-out that to me point to limited time and budget.<br />
<br />
Sound:   7<br />
It is not bad but neither is it good, though it is slowly growing on me. My first impressions were that this sound like something that could have played on radio in 2014. Which probably is intentional now that I think about it. But I can&#039;t help but think that it sounds just a tad dated.<br />
<br />
Characters: 7<br />
Not really too rememberable other than the android police and the human police girl. Others are just there to give life and work as either brains or muscle of the group. Each of them do have things they exceed. Character models are beautiful and the characters actually feel a little more human and they feel more developed compared to what you find in character category of romance anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
It is there! If you have an open mind and focus on the story which is the highlight of this one it will take you far. But if you can&#039;t get over the fact that this one is indeed 3D animated, (2D fans raging noices) you want to look the other way.<br />
<br />
Overall:      7.5<br />
Might rate 8 in the end, but that depends on how the story ends. So far I like it.<br />

    To be honest, I only started watching this because of the terrible rating. And although my rating for it isn&#039;t high, I have a pretty low average. So what I&#039;m trying to say is this isn&#039;t as bad as all the sheep trashing it for 3D CGI would have you believe. The elitists just want to feel cool like bullying &quot;that&quot; kid because everyone else is doing the same. But in reality, all the reasons Ex-Arm sucks are the same all of your favorite shows suck.<br />
<br />
For example, one of the most insulting things, to me, is Ex-Arm&#039;s naive loud-mouth moralizing protagonist, Akira Natsume, that sounds

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395293">
        like a poster of rules in the elementary school principle&#039;s office. He&#039;s the guy that will tell you revenge is bad, to be yourself except when you act against him, to stop plotting against the &quot;good guys&quot;, while he has no qualms killing anyone himself -- all without a shred of empathy for the people who he&#039;s speaking down to. In other words, he&#039;s like a bastard stepchild of your favorite shounen protagonists, like Li Xin from Kingdom or Touma from A Certain Magical Index. <br />
<br />
Then there are the ridiculously badly choreographed fight scenes, where bullets fire into the air and disappear, or one person fires 4 shots at another who is free-falling in slow motion, or people just make up theories about magical powers mid-fight and act like that&#039;s the only possibility. You know, exactly like the JoJo franchise and Jujutsu Kaisen.<br />
<br />
When things go awry, there is always the same backup plan: let Akira, the super-hacker make up a bunch of nonsensical technobabble, in a world where all of technology are somehow networked, where nuclear weapons don&#039;t have a mechanical key or that even if they do, physics itself, including all of human&#039;s collective negative emotions could get hacked. Think no further than Akudama Drive. On that note, Akira saves the world, but only by proposing a solution that would cause massive economic failure and epic mass starvation in the real world. Also Akudama Drive.<br />
<br />
Then there are little bits of weird ecchi stuff, like two girls have to make out to unlock Akira&#039;s full powers. Sounds like Infinite Stratos, or something; I&#039;m sure you could think of others.<br />
<br />
The plot doesn&#039;t really make sense. Unexplained pieces of alien weapons suddenly show up 15 years ago, and everyone just assumes that they couldn&#039;t be reproduced. That&#039;s, I don&#039;t know... Fire Force?<br />
<br />
My point is this show sucks, but not any more than tons of other shows suck. So if you&#039;re laughing at how bug-eyed the characters look, but you watch Clannad. Or you&#039;re wonder how arbitrary the police chain of command seems to be, but you think that makes Jujustsu Kaisen more realistic. Or you&#039;re mad that Minami once says, &quot;Just forget about revenge and remember how happy your family once was before they were all slaughtered and killed in a terror attack!&quot; And Al-Jard actually says, &quot;You know what, you&#039;re right!&quot; Just remember what Emma in Promised Neverland did, and what every season of My Hero Academia tries to do. If you think it&#039;s stupid that a character absorbs technology, just remember Akira.<br />
<br />
And then get off that high horse.<br />
<br />
This show is bad. But it&#039;s par for the course. It deserves a MAL score of 2, only if SAO, et. al., deserves a MAL score of 2. It&#039;s like an amalgamation of all the crappy shounen cliches from the other shows.
