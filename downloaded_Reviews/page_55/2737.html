    This is a bishounen anime.  It&#039;s a showcase of gorgeous guys.  It has very pretty animation--lots of the outdoor scenes have a rich, glowing atmosphere, characters live in ornamented rooms, and everyone has detailed hair and eyes that glow like gems.  But the eye-candy factor is really the only positive thing about this anime.  It&#039;s the only reason I didn&#039;t give it a lower rating, which it honestly deserves.  <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t mean to offend, but probably the only viewers that would actually enjoy this show are angsty teen girls who need some affirmation.  Because the side characters spend most

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30638">
        of their time worrying about, discussing, or affirming our main character (who comes across as a sensitive weakling who doesn&#039;t actually do anything).<br />
<br />
I gave this series a low rating because there is practically no story.  It&#039;s almost as if the script began as 4-episode OVA, but then someone decided to stretch it into a full-season series.  For an incredible 24 episodes, practically nothing happens, and by the end of the series, we&#039;ve barely learned anything about the characters.  Even about Yuki, who&#039;s supposedly our hero.<br />
<br />
The setup seemed promising.  We meet our main character, Yuki.  He apparently has some supernatural skill, including healing.  More interesting is his ability to look into people&#039;s minds by touching them.<br />
<br />
Yuki was raised at an orphanage.  A guy claiming to be his long-lost brother takes him out, tells Yuki that he is a re-incarnated fighter, and now must live with other re-incarnated fighters.  For centuries, the souls of these warriors have been fighting demons in each generation.  Each character has a unique fighting skill.  And most of these warriors are high school kids (and, of course, totally hot-looking).<br />
<br />
The first few episodes were interesting, but after that, it seemed the series devolved into....Yuki-worship. <br />
<br />
Yuki is the only one of the team who has no memories of his past.  For some inexplicable reason, all the other warriors adore him.  It&#039;s like their whole world revolves around him.  When Yuki is sad, everyone sits around in the living room, doing nothing.  When he is away from the house, they stand around in the dining room, doing nothing.  And the whole time, they randomly call out his name: &quot;Yuki,&quot; or ask, &quot;I wonder how Yuki is doing now?&quot;  &quot;I wonder how he&#039;s feeling?&quot;  &quot;I feel so sorry for Yuki.&quot;  It made me want to say,  &quot;SHUT UP AND DO SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE!!!  DON&#039;T YOU GUYS HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO?&quot;  For warriors, they spend a lot of time worrying about their comrade&#039;s...angst.  I almost forgot this story was supposed to be about a big battle of good vs. evil.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s stuff like that which eats up most of the time in each show.  Again, and again, characters stand around, randomly saying each other&#039;s names.  It&#039;s like the creators were scraping around trying to stuff in every possible bit of filler they could.  I wonder if the actors felt ashamed, having to say such inane lines over and over again.<br />
<br />
The things which I actually wanted to know more about was never discussed.  For instance, Yuki and Luka&#039;s backstory is barely discussed, even though it&#039;s supposedly important.  Yuki is said to be important to the team, but he barely uses any of his skills.  (After the first 2 or 3 episodes, he barely use his super abilities any more.)  There are a few meaningful conversations, and an occasional battle (which are decently done).<br />
<br />
But for the most part, any chance to put in real or meaningful content was scrapped in favor of filler that communicated...nothing.  <br />
<br />
I think I&#039;ve beat this series enough, so I won&#039;t say much more (except that a lot of the costumes and weapons were downright cheesy).  Unless you&#039;re a major bishounen fan, you probably won&#039;t enjoy this series much.  The last episode wasn&#039;t much of an ending.  Nothing was really resolved.  It was like, &quot;Was that it?  Did I miss something?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
(P.S. Despite the tag, it&#039;s not truly a shounen-ai)

    The Zweilt Guardians are a bunch of hot males, plus one female, who have supernatural powers. Their purpose is to defeat these powerful, sexy demons called Duras who wish to destroy mankind. The innocent and oblivious main protagonist, Yuki, is approached by the Zweilts because he is their light and hope in this never-ending battle. Granted, this is just your basic good vs. evil story with pretty boys on the screen, but this by all means ISN&#039;T a bad anime.<br />
<br />
STORY &amp; CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
Uraboku gets off to a serious start, delving into heavy subject matter such as: orphans, troubled pasts, parental abuse, death threats, and world destruction.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29894">
        What an impressive way to begin things. It makes you wonder why everything is so dark and sinister around the most innocent person in the world, Yuki.<br />
<br />
Yuki is a soft-spoken and mature boy who helps to take care of children in an orphanage that he had grown up in, and he often hangs out with his childhood friend. The peaceful days don’t last forever though as the Duras begin to stir activities nearby while his friend engages in more odd, secretive behavior. Furthermore, Yuki has these powers that suddenly awaken and cause problems. After a series of odd events, he meets a mysterious, sexy beast named Luka who claims to be his protector, followed by members of the Zweilt, and the head of the Giou Clan who tells Yuki that he is his half-brother and would like to take him away. So they end up taking him to the Twilight Mansion, and he comes to learn all about the Zweilt Guardians and their shared destiny.<br />
<br />
Luka is a powerful duras fighting on the protagonist’s side, and it’s obvious that he is very attracted to Yuki and vice versa. Most of the time, he is standing around quietly with a deadpan expression and wearing ridiculous outfits. While he doesn’t seem to be that great initially, he gradually gets more involved with the other characters. In addition to that, he has an ancient love story that he is hiding from Yuki, and it eventually becomes a concern and interest to him.<br />
<br />
The Zweilt Guardians are strong, courageous fighters who have a detailed history behind their group. Most of them look to be Yuki’s age, and they each have a close partner that they fight with. In fact, they’re almost always seen in pairs and act like a big family. Their characterizations are very well done, for they have distinct personalities, fully developed backgrounds, and a strong fighting morale. Seriously, they rarely ever hesitate in battle and emphasize on working as a team. Their close relationships give off a certain charm as they grow into very likeable characters. However, their main drawback is that they can be too sentimental and melodramatic at times, and they constantly worry about Yuki every darn minute. Let the poor feminine boy breathe!<br />
<br />
The Duras are the big weakness of the show. None of them can be taken that seriously except for one that appears in a very late episode. The main bad guy turns out to be a horrible cliché (I’m sure you can guess who it is), and his henchmen consist of a pair of evil twins, a giggly girl who collects hot guys, a sexy woman who wants Luka, etc. Some of them easily get obliterated, but the higher-grade demons do receive a bit more characterization.<br />
<br />
There are a few side characters who also reside in the Twilight Mansion, such as the doctor, the maid, etc. They are annoying, clichéd, and their comedy doesn&#039;t even beat Luka&#039;s bizarre outfits. But don’t worry; they don’t actually get a lot of screen time. I nearly dropped this series when they were introduced too.<br />
<br />
SHOUNEN-AI<br />
<br />
This anime is classified as shounen-ai, meaning boy-love. But if you’re coming into this expecting something along the lines of Gravitation or Junjou Romantica, you will be disappointed. You will never see any obvious indication of shounen-ai, like &#039;kissing&#039; for example. Some of the male characters are rather close, but they could also just pass off as best friends. They&#039;re left up to your interpretation. Personally, I am not a big shounen-ai fan, so I appreciate how the gay tones are handled in this.<br />
<br />
SOUNDTRACK<br />
<br />
Epic, just epic! This is undoubtedly the best OST that I have heard all year. The music is done by Shōgo Kaida whom I have not quite heard of before. During major battles, the tunes are orchestral, enchanting, and dark, such as “Zweilt Imashime no Te” and “Me wa Yaiba Kami wa Yoru.” Another great track that has a soothing, ghostly choir in the background is called “Bloody†Cross”. During slow scenes, the music is usually airy, melodic, and sweet such as “Kaeranu Hibi Shiroki Ashita.” You can easily find these on YT for streaming.<br />
<br />
There are two OP songs, “Till the World without Betrayals” and “Inishie” by Rayflower. They’re decent Jrock at best, but they’re not my favorite, and I probably won’t listen to them again after the series ends.<br />
<br />
OVERALL<br />
<br />
Uraboku has a lot of things going for itself, such as a likeable, well-developed cast of visually-appealing characters, colorful action, dark undertones, and an epic OST. Plus, the shounen-ai tones are very subtle much to my pleasure. However, the plot really does lack originality, and the villains are clichéd and can’t be taken seriously.

    It seems Uragiri creators got their hands on some list of ingredients absolutely necessary to make an anime:<br />
bishounen – yes;<br />
shounen-ai – yes;<br />
teen fighters – yes;<br />
magic – yes;<br />
reincarnation – yes;<br />
not so Ordinary High School Student with superpowers – yes;<br />
sexy demon aka loyal servant – yes;<br />
kawaii animal with a forehead gem – yes;<br />
flowing cloaks, crosses, chains and other clanking metal things – in abundance;<br />
sophisticated spells and names in pseudo-German – yes.<br />
Wait, seems there is something missing... Oh, yeah, plot. Well, its optional. As well as logic.<br />
90% of time the screen is occupied by main character Yuki (a boy who happens to be a girl in his previous

          <span style="display: none;" id="review47701">
        life), crying and moaning: “Kanata-san! Kanata-san!” – in reference to his best friend who turned out to be the main Bad Guy of this story. Sometimes other characters take the stage, crying and moaning: “Yuki! Yuki!” – in reference to his cruel destiny which makes Yuki to accept people&#039;s pain and suffering as his own. <br />
Then, there are meaningless battles with bad guys, in which Yuki, though utterly useless, tries to help his comrades. The problem is his comrades have a mission to protect Yuki while he sees his mission in protecting others, so they all go in circles. And there is no proper ending, as it always happens with anime based on an ongoing manga. <br />
In theory, the story should be made more intriguing by the fact that Yuki-girl and the above mentioned sexy demon by the name of Luka were lovers in their previous life, and Luka still loves Yuki-boy dearly. Unfortunately, Yuki himself doesn&#039;t remember anything (though has some vague idea). But every time he tries to talk to Luka about this, they are interrupted by others, who seem to be unable to survive without Yuki even for a minute. So the shounen-ai is somehow incomplete.<br />
The only consolation is that bishounen are in abundance, music is fine and voice actors are good (though always spurting some embarrassing nonsense). All in all, not the worst way to kill time – but not the best either.<br />

    X/1999 meets Angel Sanctuary meets Night Head Genesis. <br />
<br />
Three episodes of this anime managed to remind me of three series I have previously watched. And I&#039;m not talking about a vague reminder. I&#039;m talking blatantly obvious similarities. Yes, UraBoku demonstrates a serious lack of originality from the start, and it sure is not afraid to admit it. Neither the story nor the characters offer something new and inspiring. The art is good, but it also offer very little innovation and originality, especially concerning the characters.<br />
The reason why I&#039;ve decided to write this review after watching only three episodes is because it would be silly to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25526">
        say that there is still room for surprise or some turn of events that will inject a concentrated amount of originality into UraBoku. <br />
However (yes, there is a however), I absolutely enjoyed every episode I have seen. Sure, I gave it a rational 5, because, so far, it deserves no more (if that), but rationality has nothing to do with the level of enjoyment. The male characters are absolutely beautiful, and I believe there&#039;s no fangirl out there incapable enjoying an anime with a life time supply of bishies in it. <br />
As I have mentioned before, originality is not something this anime thrives in. If you&#039;re looking for a never-before-seen story - stay away, if you&#039;re looking for a character that&#039;s complex and different - run like hell. However (yet another one), if you&#039;re looking for something familiar and safe, something that will help you turn off your busy brain; if you&#039;re looking for your standard shounen ai bishies, you better start watching UraBoku. <br />
So lower your expectations, turn off your brain and just enjoy it. I know I will.

    &#039;Betrayal Knows My Name&#039; seemed like a promising anime with my interest lying in the central plot (or what I originally thought was the central plot prior to completing the anime) of Yuki and Luka.  In Yuki&#039;s past life he and Luka fell deeply, and madly, in love.  Luka finds Yuki again in his next life (reincarnated as a male) and stays by his side for the entire 24 episode run.<br />
<br />
Up front that seems like a promising romance story.  You have Luka who is madly in love with Yuki and will protect him as well as do anything for him.  But

          <span style="display: none;" id="review142125">
        then you have Yuki, the main character, who has no memories of his previous life with Luka or the love that they shared.  Through more than obvious hints and comments from the side characters of the story, Yuki does in fact have a good idea that he and Luka were past lovers.  But through the 24 episodes all he seems to do is have a complete and utter lack of interest in it.  I can&#039;t say that he was &#039;avoiding&#039; the subject because the subject never came up!<br />
<br />
In fact, BKMN seems to focus ten thousand times more on the relationship between Yuki and his childhood best friend, Kanata.  There are more flashbacks, memories, and emotions tied between the two of them.  And Yuki is shown having much more feelings for Kanata than Luka, in my opinion, throughout the 24 episodes of the series.<br />
<br />
By the end of the anime Yuki and Luka&#039;s relationship has not progressed one single step forward.  Yuki uses him as a means of protection and comfort and takes him for granted more or less.  For example in Episode 4 Yuki first tends to Tsukumo who is wounded by a slash on his shoulder, then he goes to speak with his school acquaintance who is emotionally scarred and depressed, then he goes to the orphan children to untie and comfort them only to be upset himself as they react very negatively to his presence and tell him not to touch them.  Yuki then has his own moment of feeling sorry for himself and cries to Luka about how pitififul he feels.  Luka who has been standing by his side watching him tend to everyone and everything with a deadpan expression on his face and a gaping hole in his abdomen.  Luka, out of everyone there, was the one most severly injured and the ONLY ONE who Yuki ignored.  In fact it isn&#039;t until the next day, in the afternoon, in Episode 5, that Yuki turns to Luka and asks him if he would like him to heal his wound as well.<br />
<br />
Whoops, guess Yuki forgot that he had been stabbed.  Everyone else was on his mind, apparently, and everyone else remains on his mind for the rest of the series.  Luka is probably dead last on Yuki&#039;s &#039;my most important people&#039; list.<br />
<br />
I love Luka&#039;s dedication and loyalty as well as his deep, emotional, feelings of undying love... but those traits just turn negative and annoying when they are spent on a character who doesn&#039;t deserve them.  Luka became a mindless drone in many of the scenes where he literally has no reaction to anything.  He literally means that he will do anything for Yuki, let Yuki do anything, and never &#039;betray&#039; him even if Yuki puts him last on his list and treats him like the dog he&#039;s acting to be.<br />
<br />
Aside from his obvious mistreatment of Luka, there are an onslought of additional things I despise about Yuki.  For starters I cannot stand how utterly useless and worthless he is.  For the entirety of the 24 episodes he literally stands around and does NOTHING.  He mopes in his own self-misery and only has fleeting moments of happiness --- which only surface when the entire side character cast is surrounding him and gushing words of love, admiration, and need.  He is constantly putting his &#039;team&#039; in danger as he recklessly rushes off to be a part of the battle.  And by being a &#039;part of the battle&#039; to Yuki that literally means just standing in the background, wide eyed, and watching everyone get beaten up while he continues his internal monologue of how useless and powerless he is.<br />
<br />
The cast of other characters in the story could have had potential and could have been likable if they all didn&#039;t dive into &#039;Yuki Worship&#039;.  And when I say &#039;ALL&#039; I mean &#039;ALL&#039;.  Hell, even the main bad guy dives into &#039;Yuki Worship&#039;.  The entire anime is glorifying the main character over and over shoving it down the viewers mouth just how wonderful, brilliant, loving, innocent, sparkly and selfless Yuki is.<br />
<br />
Well, I don&#039;t know where that Yuki is or where he went because the main character I&#039;ve been watching for the past 24 episodes is nothing but useless, worthless, SELFISH, insensitive, and again SELFISH.  Yuki is the most selfish character in the entire anime when it comes to the good guy team.<br />
<br />
With how pathetic, selfish, and useless he is it&#039;s no wonder he and his teammates have been reincarnated over and over for the past thousand years to fight a never ending battle that they keep losing.  News flash, guys, it&#039;s time to kick God&#039;s Light to the curb.  He&#039;s the one putting you all in danger in the first place because he&#039;s constantly inserting himself into danger intentionally and can&#039;t seem to comprehend that that, in turn, puts his entire team in danger because now they have to run out and try to save his sorry but AGAIN.

    This is my very anime-waiting-list coz I read its manga first and hear its CD-dorama. And just like i expected ...it&#039;s awesome! Sugoooi! It also use some of legendary seiyuus *just like in the CD-dorama* YATTAA<br />
<br />
The story&#039;s plot is a little bit too fast than the manga, but it&#039;s design with some wonderul scene, great effects, chibi-verision, and even there&#039;re some unexpected-scene I&#039;ve never seen. So no problem at all<br />
<br />
In the short words, some of the good guys reincarnated again same as before in previous life,except only for the princess of kami-no-hikari cos SHE&#039;s now HE! Without any memory of previous life. Her lover from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review26383">
        the duras (akuma) still loves her,eventhough she&#039;s now born as a bishounen. That&#039;s why, some of people think URABOKU is yaoi. Will the boy regain his memory again and face the truth later? It&#039;s so exciting to wait the final result! <br />
<br />
EDIT: <br />
The plot finally reach the past-life of Takashiro &amp; Reiga.So cool &amp; very drastic!

    Let me tell you this first: If you&#039;re looking for a nice random anime, I would try this one. ^^ Maybe, it&#039;s looks a bit cliché or simple at the beginning, but I am certain you will like it. This is because this is one of the so called &quot;divers&quot; anime&#039;s who contain some points everyone likes.<br />
<br />
Story: I think it&#039;s a touching story. In the first episode (btw, I am not gonna spoil anything, but only some moments in the first episode) you meet the protaganist, named Sakurai Yuki. He&#039;s a real goodie, and is independent, because he doesn&#039;t have any relatives anymore. But when

          <span style="display: none;" id="review26704">
        one dark-looking guy approaches the boy, the whole story begins. This man, Luka (Zess = codename) is claiming to be his servant en wants to protect Yuki, because he&#039;s important to him. Yuki discovers he&#039;s from a Giouh Clan, which means he has some magic power inside him. Which one, I am not gonna tell you, you have to watch if you want to know. Because of this power, he has a destiny to fight some dangerous creatures, named Duras. And of course, Luka is helping him. (There are more Giouh Clan members introduced in the series) Their relationship is growing during the episodes. It&#039;s a pain I can&#039;t say anymore about this series, because I don&#039;t want to spoil, but you know the main line of the story. They fight as a pair together with other pairs, to destroy those Duras. (mankinds enemy) The reason I gave the story an 8, is because it&#039;s interesting and not as cliché as I thought before. It&#039;s like a big puzzle. Every episode is important for the next. No fillers!<br />
<br />
The art is very beautiful. It looks similar to Vampire Knight&#039;s art, but I think it&#039;s different though. I gave this subject a 9. Fighting scenes, or emotional moments between characters are very well drawned. That&#039;s attractive.<br />
<br />
The sound is good too. Hmm, not very divers, but the opening song is great. I like the ending song too, and some of the OST&#039;s. The sound is a good match with the events. That&#039;s the reason I didn&#039;t gave it a 7, but an 8 too.<br />
<br />
Characters are interesting:) Maybe, that was my reason to watch more episodes. You&#039;re pulled in when you like Luka or some of the others characters. It&#039;s not the case that the main characters are the only important ones. They give small characters an important roll is as well. You get much information about them. My favorite fightpair is: Hotsuma and Shusei^^ Oh, another good point is that the characters are not similar to each other. So they won&#039;t get boring. Characters: 8 too.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8. You don&#039;t have to be patient when you start with this anime, but you have to be neutral. Don&#039;t get an opinion too quick, because it&#039;s really good. The manga is popular as well, and now they made an anime and are still airing. When you think like this, you won&#039;t consider this anime as a waste of time. I like it very much and I am glad for trying this one. Just try one episode, or two, and you&#039;ll see why. I can&#039;t wait for the next episode to come out! <br />
<br />
Overall: An average score: 8. They could make the sound more interesting (OST&#039;s) and I think they have to tell a bit more about the small characters. (although they did, but I think it can be more) But it&#039;s overall a great anime to start with or to watch ones per week. It will never get boring and it&#039;s worth it! Just try!

    I really cannot think of enough good things to say about this anime! The story is wonderful (if a little cliched at times), the characters are believable and hilarious, and the art is absolutely breathtaking!<br />
<br />
The best part of this anime, however, has got to be the main character, Yuki. Despite the fact that he has no defensive or offensive powers of his own, he refuses to sit on the sidelines and let others defend him.  And, unlike most heroes/heroines in his position, he is not completely helpless.  He is very skilled in the martial arts, and utilizes that skill to the fullest!<br />
<br />
Overall, this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27676">
        anime is completely spectacular, and I reccomend it to anyone who wants fantasy, adventure, romance (with more than a little shounen ai), and humor, all rolled into one!

    I don&#039;t usually review an anime before it&#039;s over but this one&#039;s a bit different. Scores will change as the series go on, I guess.<br />
<br />
As many have said, the storyline is really cliché, boy with a troubled past, mysterious power, joining a larger  group of people with powers in order to save the world. Currently, there doesn&#039;t seem to be much behind this story, I haven&#039;t read the manga yet but many can pretty much see where this is heading, so here&#039;s my somewhat detailed opinion on the first 9 episodes of Uraboku.<br />
<br />
Story - 7/10<br />
As previously mentioned, there isn&#039;t much substance to the actual

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27016">
        story at the moment, it&#039;s your typical  mysterious boy with unique powers that is in danger from another evil group of people that also seem to want or are afraid of his powers. However, there&#039;s something quite alluring about this series based on the first 9  episodes, I found every episode enjoyable to watch despite its predictability, whether it be the characters are  the amazing art. The story itself isn&#039;t great but the pace is neither too slow nor too fast, it doesn&#039;t drag on or skip ahead too much, this and the amount of action I&#039;ve seen so far is enough for me to want to keep watching.<br />
<br />
Art - 10/10<br />
The art is absolutely amazing, beautiful and detailed. Characters are outstandingly drawn to be unique  individuals, scenery is pretty even the evil guys are pretty. Special effects/spells are done amazingly also. The  art in Uraboku is one that bears a stark resemblance to Vampire Knight, so if you loved that then I guess you&#039;ll  love this even more.<br />
<br />
Sound - 9/10<br />
The soundtrack is fitting, nothing special but it is used perfectly to create the right atmosphere and feeling  intended based on what is happening. The OP and ED are also well chosen. I&#039;m glad to see some familiar voice  actors like Sakurai Takahiro, Fukuyama Jun and Ono Daisuke, however, something about Yuki&#039;s voice seems to annoy me greatly. Other than that, the voice actors fit their roles amazingly. <br />
<br />
Characters - 8.5/10<br />
Again, the characters are rather cliché like the storyline. I find Luka pretty 1-dimensional at the moment, playing the servant role to Yuki because he sees the previous Yuki&#039;s soul in the current one, however, he&#039;s just cool enough for a girl like me not to care. The others are not entirely 1-dimensional characters however they&#039;re pretty much your average characters in a cliché story where they have troubled pasts which the anime goes on to address eventually. I quite like the relationships the Zwelit Guardians share with each other as pairs, it really brings out the shounen ai in this anime, it&#039;s not explicit nor is it too vague, for people who shounen ai isn&#039;t something they particularly enjoy, you could just interpret it as deep friendship between two guys. Overall, each character is unique in terms of power and personality, moreover, each one is one heck of a bishy.<br />
<br />
Overall - 8/10<br />
I&#039;m still expecting more from this anime so this score will undoubtedly change depending on whether future  episodes meet my expectations or not. Currently, I feel that the first 9 episodes have brought the anime to a positive start, I&#039;ve enjoyed every episode so far and it&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve seen an anime that isn&#039;t unbearably slow to begin with. Although the story is cliché for many, if you&#039;re looking for an anime with a simple plot, eye candy characters, supernatural powers then you might want to consider adding Uraboku to your list.

    This is what basically happens to Uraboku: nothing.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t get why Yuki was their (supposed) hero. In fact, everyone was trying to protect him. Okay, so he can heal wounds and all and he&#039;s the God&#039;s Light, but they should have shown that instead of the other way around. Sure, there were scenes wherein he protected his friends, but they were very, very few.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong here when I said nothing happened to the story, because really, there were none. One thing that also disappointed me was that they didn&#039;t elaborate much on Yuki and Luka&#039;s past. It would&#039;ve been wonderful if Yuki somehow

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34590">
        remembered that they were lovers from before. They didn&#039;t even get to end that fight with Reiga and the two other general-class Duras. All there is to the ending were a bunch of confessions (as what I&#039;d like to call it) with their partners. Which was actually fine for me since that&#039;s the closest to shounen-ai that this story could offer.<br />
<br />
I wouldn&#039;t say that I didn&#039;t have fun watching this though, because this was an okay watch. I appreciated that they actually made small stories for some of the Zweilt Guardians&#039; pasts, including Takahiro and Reiga&#039;s. It&#039;s just that they could have done better with its 24 episodes.

    To be honest, the only thing good or at least satisfying about this anime are the hot guys. Oh, and the graphics, the characters look really really good, with lots of details and nevertheless, the outside sceneries look truly fantastic.<br />
<br />
Story: The story is completely boooring. It&#039;s true, in the beginning you are somehow captivated but after a few episodes it gets very uninteresting. This whole anime is about Yuki, the most ANNOYING chacarcter. Why? Well, I really hate it when the main hero always needs to be babysitted by the other characters. In every single episode you will hear at least 4 times someone asking

          <span style="display: none;" id="review134799">
        Yuki if he is alright and if we put together this scenes we could make 5 episodes of other characters worrying about Yuki. Another fact is that this anime should have had maximum 12-13 episodes because in most of the episodes the action is missing and you get really bored.<br />
<br />
Sound: Sound is ok. I rated 9/10. I like both the openings and endings.<br />
<br />
Characters: Like i said, Yuki is the most annoying character of the series. The ones that I liked were Reiga and Luka. Although in this anime they are talking about thier previous lives and how they are always reborn, we find NOTHING at all about Luka and that is really sad, because he seemed an interesting character. Nevertheless, we learn nothing about Yuki, who what the hell is the main character but still, his past remains blurred.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: The fights are enjoyable enough, that&#039;s fair, but this is all I enjoyed.<br />
<br />
Overall: This anime is bad. Bad. I do not recommend it. It&#039;s truly a waste of time.<br />

    Heh, I dropped this after 7th episode. It looks like to me as if heros from Vampire Knight (I don&#039;t like VK) are traped in prophery from X/1999 (I love X and all works from CLAMP) plus the genre change reminds to me Angel Sanctuary (I didn&#039;t find anything interesting on AS) and the paranormal ability are as from Night Head Genesis (I like NHG). So in the end this strange and not original mix isn&#039;t my cup of tea.

    This anime is bishounen central. That may have been (part) of the reason I became motivated to watch it, because I stopped watching after the first four episodes, took a long break, then started again a day or two ago. I thought it would be really good, as I have a couple of friends who are a fan of it.<br />
<br />
Well. I guess I got a kick out of watching this.<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not the story itself that&#039;s bad. The premise is good, maybe a bit average; MC with special abilities he has no clue about. He suddenly gets involved in this mess with creatures called Duras,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review82366">
        whereupon he meets a man named Luka who swears to protect him. The main character, Yuki, has actually been reborn several times (and this is no spoiler; they give it away within the first four episodes), with other members of his family he had no idea about until the attack, and with Luka.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s the development that&#039;s bad.<br />
<br />
For an anime with such an interesting premise, the development is bad, I could even say horrible. Why? I had about a billion burning questions, and pretty much none of them were answered? Sure, the characters were asking the questions themselves, but there was never. An answer.<br />
<br />
Examples:<br />
1) Why was Yuki a girl in his past three lives but is now a boy?<br />
2) Why does everyone seem to revolve around Yuki?<br />
3) How did previous!Yuki get together with Luka?<br />
<br />
There are also a huge number of cliche&#039;ed lines in this anime. There were so many that I felt kind of embarrassed when I heard them.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
<br />
The art was pretty good. I felt like it was a bit inconsistent, but I didn&#039;t really care. Although the animation was smooth and beautiful, I have to say. The hair.  It&#039;s so distracting. There were a lot of those &#039;wind-blowing&#039; scenes, and all I&#039;d do was stare at the hair going &#039;Lol what so much hair&#039;.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
<br />
Another better area in this anime. All the seiyuus did a great job. Although Yuki&#039;s voice annoyed me a hundred percent of the time. I&#039;m not sure, but something about his voice just really annoyed me. I can&#039;t hate his seiyuu, because he&#039;s played quite a bit of characters I can respect. I guess the quality was a bit less in this anime.<br />
<br />
Character: 5<br />
<br />
Ahahaha oh god. This is where most of the shit hits the fan. And it&#039;s mostly because of our main character, Yuki.<br />
<br />
Yuki is literally such a useless character. They try to portray him as such a kind, caring character, I get it. He always seems to want to &#039;do something about the current situation&#039;, but he can&#039;t because he&#039;s absolutely powerless. He goes &#039;I&#039;m going to save ______!&#039; but he can&#039;t, because he doesn&#039;t have any power.<br />
<br />
Or rather he does, but he doesn&#039;t use it.<br />
<br />
See, he uses his power in situations that come rarely. Like the last couple of episodes. He somehow magically has the ability to use his offensive power, although he&#039;s been useless for the past 20 episodes.<br />
<br />
Another thing that had me going &quot;lol wuh&#039; doing the anime was how Yuki-centric it is. Everyone loves Yuki. Yuki is amazing. Yuki is so kind. Our world revolves around Yuki. Yuki is our sun. Yuki is our GOD. When Yuki is sad, we&#039;ll just mope around at home. When Yuki is gone, they&#039;ll be like &quot;Where is he? I wonder if he&#039;s okay? Can you here his voice? Yuki. Yuki. Yuki, YUKI.&quot;<br />
<br />
I should make a tally, someday, of how many times I laughed when this happened versus how many times I wanted to break my iPod&#039;s screen.<br />
<br />
Luka is our apathetic guy who&#039;s so madly in love with Yuki that he&#039;d never betray him. In fact, that&#039;s his motto. He says it in every episode, right before the OP &quot;Only I can know your pain, and only I can know your uncertainity. I will say it a million times, if you need it... I will never betray you!&quot; He&#039;s portrayed as a pretty epic badass. Although his clothes are kind of hilarious and over the top, his character is not that bad. It happens off screen, but apparently before Luka arrived at the Twilight Mansion, he was very anti-social (whoa, whoa, surprise there). But ever since Yuki came, he began to open the doors to his heart. This is the only development we see, in his character, at least.<br />
<br />
The side characters had a LOT of potential. I liked them much more than the main characters (particularly Hotsuma and Shusei), but unfortunately, they were not given too much time to develop their characters, and they were Yuki-ists as well.<br />
<br />
The villains were generic. I don&#039;t even think I need to describe them, I was pretty much facepalming every time I saw them.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6.5<br />
<br />
Honestly, I got so annoyed with Yuki I barely had any room to actually enjoy the show. One of the only parts  of the anime I liked was the Hotsuma/Shusei arc, and that&#039;s probably it. The rest of the time I was laughing or trying not to break my iPod screen. Still, that being said, I don&#039;t hate it. I did enjoy some parts, if not all. It was fair, not the most enjoyable anime I have ever come across of.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6<br />
<br />
Honestly, I hoped it&#039;d be better. Not bad, it was okay. I could list at least a hundred other animes better than this, but it was okay. That&#039;s all I can say about it; okay. The outfits were ridiculous at times, and the animation was really pretty. The OST was good. This isn&#039;t actually a shounen-ai, but it implies a lot. You can interpret the pairings in whatever way makes you comfortable. Some of the characters are very close, such as Hotsuma and Shusei. <br />

    This is going to be a very blunt, very short review.<br />
<br />
UraBoku = Blue Seed. The only difference is that UraBoku has a hint of BL to its proceedings, and its animation is better. <br />
<br />
UraBoku isn&#039;t bad exactly - its just not even slightly original. The first five episodes or so are boring as hell, though. I&#039;ve read most of the manga, so it should improve, but don&#039;t go into this expecting something fresh and amazing. This is purely disposable entertainment, the kind of thing you watch to kill time. Not awful, but certainly nothing to write home about. <br />
<br />
It does have a good soundtrack, though.

    Ok, I just finished watching this anime, first let me go over what I liked about it.<br />
<br />
The guys are all hot! Oh yeah, if you want some great eye candy then this one is a good one to try. Its also a Shounen-ai which makes it even better and an action one at that. So if you love bishie boy action type of animes then it is worth checking out.<br />
<br />
However, although an anime has these elements does not mean I can give it a high score. Heck I have watched plenty of bishie type animes that I couldn&#039;t get past the fifth episode of and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review60215">
        had no choice but to drop *looking at you Mien Liebe* so I have no other choice but to go over everything that ticked me off about this anime. <br />
<br />
The story is about a boy named Yuki who was reincarnated from a woman, he gets saved by a man named Zess from a Duras (evil creature thingy) and he gets caught up in a war between the Giou Clan and the Duras. At least this is the best way i can explain the story because when it first comes on you will honestly not understand anything about anything concerning this story. You feel as if you were dropped in the very center of the story and you have to struggle to catch up. When i really think about it, the show doesn&#039;t do a good job of explaining what the heck these Duras even are or where they came from or why one character can control them even though he is only half Duras. Anyway, Yuki and Zess become close and we discover that they were once lovers when yuki was a woman. Zess is still very devoted to Yuki but sadly it doesn&#039;t seem to progress from there. The relationship between them is never fully touched upon. Yuki and Zess stare at one another, profess that they long to see each other when the other isn&#039;t around, they touch each other faces but that is all you get out of them. No kisses, no passion, not even an acknowledgment from yuki that he even remembers the relationship even after he remembers everything else.<br />
<br />
The story has its moments of drawing you in, such as the potential subplots with the other Zweilts(sp). You have two guys who seem like they could be lovers and one is struggling with his feelings of guilt because he hurt his partner.<br />
<br />
The Zweilt(sp) partners who both seek revenge on the Duras general who killed their trainer<br />
<br />
The story of the Giou Clan leader and his butler and past with Reiga, the villian of the show.<br />
<br />
However, these are all swing and misses as the writers don&#039;t bother to truly flesh out any of these characters and they sort of make it hard to root for them. Instead, the characters seems to have no life of their own besides worrying about Yuki, caring for Yuki, protecting Yuki, loving Yuki, and needing Yuki. They call Him their master yet you NEVER find out why. Yuki is by far the most useless character on the show. He does nothing but stand around while everyone fights and risks their lives for him, they all gather around him to protect and save him yet you never find out why the bad guy even needs him. So far all you get is that he &quot;changes people&#039;s hearts&quot; The other characters have so much potential but when they are around yuki it is all about Yuki and when they are not around Yuki they talk about nothing but Yuki.<br />
<br />
It really ticked me off when the first pairing I mentioned were talking about their relationship, it was touching, sad, tender, and almost romantic until one says &quot;You love Yuki&quot; (or something similar) then the other replies &quot;You love him too&quot; WTF?!? Yuki was barely around them and had almost no contact with them but suddenly they both love him?<br />
<br />
I swear this anime should have been called &quot;Yuki, the c**k teaser&quot; Everyone on the show falls in love with him men and women but all he does is stand around like a woman gasping and telling everyone to stop fighting. Then the bad guy finally captures him but instead of killing him he just wants him to watch his friends get killed. Mind you, i can understand that the bad guy was his friend and there was some conflict with killing him, i can understand this, but it was never explained why Yuki was so important he needed to be captured and taken. And it was done so stupidly. Yuki just stands there juicing up his powers and suddenly his in classic damsel bridal style pose near the bad guy who is taking him away. Of course, this means that the other Zweilts get to talk about Yuki for the one billionth time and go save him for the one billionth time. <br />
<br />
Anyway, as much as I complain I have seen worst and it did keep me hanging around for all 24 episodes and I would probably watch a season 2 if one comes out. It did have a decent main plot once you get over the first two or three episodes, I liked the IDEA behind Zess and Yuki, loving someone no matter if they are a man or a woman. But I wish the writers would have at least let the character TALK about that.

    the anime was recommended by a friend, and since i was doing nothing at the time, i checked it out. and like the others say, it is not particularly new, but it certainly has soimething on its own that makes the story stand out for itself.<br />
<br />
artwork reminds me much of vampire knight, (and tsukumo is the very image of zero kiryuu) tyhe seiyuus did a great job (i mean, did they ever fail?). the coloring is a bit hard to pick up, but nicely done nonetheless.<br />
<br />
suggestive words now and then are certain to make the fangirls happy once they watch this anime, but they certainly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review26776">
        won&#039;t forget the essence of the plot.<br />
<br />
yeah, i think overall, this anime is a good way to pass time, unless you&#039;re looking for some gory action and adventure without real plot, UraBoku is sure to capture your taste!

    I have not read the manga and this review is based only on the anime....<br />
<br />
Nothing..... just nothing happens in the anime. From the first episode to the last nothing happens...the story moves at a snails pace.....it bored me to hell.....I hate the character Yuki....<br />
<br />
anime has a bunch of beautiful people who all obsess over Yuki, who has done nothing, will do nothing and can do nothing....I dont know why they all obsess over him..in every damn episode all the characters just sit together and obsess about Yuki...and Luka just chants the word Yuki and nothing else........in all of 24 episodes I have seen Yuki do

          <span style="display: none;" id="review83773">
        nothing except be a wimp...<br />
<br />
GOD its just a waste of time....

    The next time an Anime character says: &#039;I...I...I..&#039; I&#039;m gonna punch someone, I swear to God. Damn even if I wanted to I wouldn&#039;t be able to count the times a person says that and doesn&#039;t finish their sentence. But alright, the review.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
The story isn&#039;t actually bad. The story has quite some depth, including the background stories of the characters (in fact this is probably the most important thing in the story). Especially because it features shounen ai, it is a more unique story than a standard romance story. Because let&#039;s face it; this is a romance anime. Sure there is some fighting, but not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review61591">
        very much. The few (compared to other anime with similar stories) fighting scenes are also generally short.<br />
<br />
The problem with the story however, are the characters. Most are cool and good, except the main character. Will talk about that later.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
I think it is comparable to anime such as Zombie Loan. I&#039;m glad they chose for normal eyes and stuff like that. Unlike other things, the art and animation didn&#039;t throw me off. It was actually quite good.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
I just said the Art didn&#039;t throw me off. The sound did. Not in overall, but the most important sound did. And that is the main character&#039;s voice. Honestly damn how annoying can a voice be, seriously. I wouldn&#039;t really care if a side character had this voice, but the main guy just talks so much with that annoying voice. It actually makes the conversations involving the main guy and someone else annoying. I honestly thought of stop watching this anime the first episodes just because of his voice. <br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
This is probably the thing that the anime does best, and does worst.<br />
Let me start with the not-so-imporant side characters. These are actually done quite well. They all have a very specific personality, are not boring and for boy-lovers here: The guys in this anime are hot. I absoluty have no problems with these characters.<br />
<br />
But now to the main character: this guy is so fucking annoying. No, it&#039;s not because that is how he&#039;s supposed to be. It&#039;s because he&#039;s crying all the fucking time, always complaining, always trying to be the good guy and always talks with this annoying voice. I have never seen such a boring main character. I couldn&#039;t&#039; care less about him. Even though he is the core of the story, this anime would have been so much better without him. The anime should have focused on the other characters. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
This is probably the first anime I have watched completely while really struggling to finish it. The only thing that kept me watching was the story and the other characters, but it was a hard time and I wouldn&#039;t recommend this anime to anyone. There are plenty of better anime out there with this setting and a good story.

    Oh boy, was I getting my hopes up for this show? That was rhetorical because the moment I watched it, I regretted it. <br />
The score for this anime is way more than it deserves, only good thing is its art, where is plot really? What&#039;s plot? <br />
What pissed me off more than plot missinf was the fact that creators are homophobic, made bishonen and shonen-ai in which characters never touch while the mc is guy, tf?? Not even a speck, like damn... don&#039;t make a shonen-ai to draw in girls, just so you get popularity please... sad attempt, you might be thinking they don&#039;t have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review335139">
        to touch, what&#039;s wrong with you, you fujoshi girl? Buuut... the thing is okey? They never fail to show you that the mc was a girl and that they had a connection and been lovers, but they fail to ever show you any worthy moment of their new relationship.<br />
Characters... other than mc who I found kinda enjoyable, no one else comes close, Luka is only hot and protecting, not actually developed...<br />
Did I mention there is no plot and that I even tried reading the manga for this reason (spoilers: no plot there), I&#039;ll give em a 2 for trying.<br />
Enjoyment you can see, only and I mean only thing this anime has is its art, I won&#039;t deny that, other than that, unwatchable, boring and dreadful. Wanna regret your time on this planet? Watch this. That&#039;s all from me.
