    “Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I&#039;m not sure about the universe.” ― Albert Einstein / a.k.a I don&#039;t quite understand the hate for this show. Why? Because you&#039;re plain stupid/dumb to understand, that&#039;s mean.<br />
<br />
What defines humanity as a whole? It&#039;s the age-old argument of stupidity. From psychology to physiology, all humans are ironically wired to have a level of stupidity, whether by a congenital lack of capacity for reasoning or temporary slow-mindedness. Don&#039;t attempt to go and defend yourself by remitting the &quot;ignorance is bliss&quot; adage, because while it doesn&#039;t equal stupidity, &quot;&#039;tis folly to be wise.&quot; Don&#039;t get me

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370177">
        wrong, the paradigm of &quot;We&#039;re All Stupid&quot; applies to everyone, regardless of your ability of perceive conceptualized notions. But rather than setting yourself up for failure, taking up irrational, emotional-filled oversimplifications of a mental state will be the moment to overcome stupidity and achieve true rationality. And that&#039;s what Talentless Nana aims to achieve here: over-complicated &quot;No shit, Sherlock&quot; acts of playing the &quot;stupidity&quot; game, down to the last culprit call to pursue and claim their reasonings, even to the satirical extremes of logic and twist the game even further down the rabbit hole.<br />
<br />
So strap in for the school-themed spatial ride, and prepare to be Crewmates, because: &quot;There are multiple impostors Among Us!&quot;<br />
<br />
If there is one quote to sum Talentless Nana as a whole, it&#039;d be this quote by Dorkly: “Blessed are the ignorant fools of the world, for they know not the unspeakable horrors that await us all.” Nevertheless, who would&#039;ve expected an unknown mangaka like Looseboy to precede a formula, that is now all the rage with Innersloth&#039;s Among Us, by 2 years no less? Yes, the show starts off as a generic My HeroAca rip-off of sorts, par with the Hero and Villain factions of the &quot;Enemies of Humanity&quot;: siding into both Talented and Talentless (you can put two and two together and make five of who and what they are, it&#039;s all filled out for you). And no, in the sense that by the end of the first episode, it takes all that and tugs it all out of the cliff in one fell swoop, just like the Talentless Nanao Nakajima. That&#039;s how you make a convincing first impression that this is more than just your generic Shounen superpower-fest show, and yessiree, it&#039;s full of SUS. This show doesn&#039;t try to sell on its world-building and unrealistic qualities of shock factors, because it really does not need one, as predictable as it can be.<br />
<br />
This show only reinforces that pink-haired yanderes full of psychological thriller-esque characters are here to stay, and they certainly aren&#039;t dumb, and that&#039;s the case of female MC Nana Hiiragi. Being sent from the human side to a Hogwarts-esque concealed island filled with generic typical My HeroAca setting of &quot;Talented&quot; people for assassination purposes, you might think that she is just dumb to plainly follow orders from the higher-ups, but over the course of the show, there is some semblance to that and then some that&#039;s not quite so.<br />
<br />
First off, her role as the assassin against the egoistic &quot;Talented&quot; kids: she&#039;s pretty much given a smartphone that dictates all Talented and their kill-counts, but overtime, it also makes you question if covering all your tracks is worth the hassle of not being found as a psychopathic secret impostor for killing strategies, by hook or by crook. And none better at that to exert her extroverted and convincing personality of persuasion as the class leader to buy people into her segue. Secondly, her backstory covered in the 2nd half of the anime shows us the true picture of Nana as a whole: Talented or Talentless, she&#039;s just as victimized as some of the characters, and for that reason, an anthropology of how she&#039;s dealt with the knives of death and revenge growing up. And that I believe is what sells on her character aesthetic: being an annoying and hideous girl that&#039;s full of sus, but also having an imperfect heart, regardless of reasoning. A Moriarty that&#039;s unlike one if I can infer at best.<br />
<br />
And that brings me to the next &quot;No shit, Sherlock&quot; MC character: the &quot;Talented&quot; immortal Kyouya Onodera (and I can already hear you say: &quot;BOO, another dumb character!&quot;). Again, I implore you to hold your horses. Yes, a stereotypical introverted and observant Sherlock Holmes character he IS one, and no, his thought processes are really exquisite to follow and figure out in the same-old Holmes&#039; fashion of &quot;How does a deranged assassin&#039;s mind work? And how does he/she go around committing the crime with little to no evidence strewn from the start?&quot;, so much so that without question you&#039;re immediately sunk into the crux of the conflict and figuring out who might be the potential culprit. You tell me: &quot;Kyouya is yet another dumbfounded character to not believe that Nana is behind it all.&quot;, but the truth of the matter is: &quot;If Nana is found out as the main culprit, why would this story and setting exist in the first place? There&#039;s always gotta be something beneath the surface that no one could ever predict.&quot; And you&#039;d be right on saying this, because it only keeps getting better.<br />
<br />
But, if there one character I can single out &quot;playing dumb&quot;, it&#039;s Michiru Inukai. At first, she seems like most other characters that likes to play the similar archetype game at first, but like Nana, where you get to understand her better, lies in her traumatic past of being a loyal dog (er, I mean, friend). The &quot;Talented&quot; girl that was shunned for just about everything in her life, from the ire of normal human beings to largely being oppressed for the fact that she is a Talent. At the very core of Michiru, lies 2 different beings: one of a descent of hidden motives (that gives a headache to Nana), and the other, what you see in the anime: a kind-hearted girl that genuinely cares for the people around her, akin to a puppy licking people&#039;s wounds but with the inability to cure illnesses, and what&#039;s detrimental is that for the Talent she has, it reduces her life expectancy. So, a divisive character that can be attuned to both sides of the story, that is what makes her character special.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, I have no words to defend the &quot;Talented&quot; students, because yes, they&#039;re all just plain dumb: infused for B-roll comedy (a.k.a fatso Moguo Iijima and his 3 henchmen) and plot devices to transcend both Nana and Kyouya into deep rabbit hole territory. I know, I know, there&#039;s the shapeshifting &quot;Enemy of Humanity&quot; human-feline Jin Tachibana with his love for animals with a psychotic-but-smart mindset, only appearing at critical times for Nana&#039;s sake in the 2nd half, but as problematic as he is, his role is better played out in future proceedings of the manga.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the manga, it wouldn&#039;t be a one-trick pony to go off the rails with filler/original content (well, except the last episode&#039;s final moments anyways), this is one of the few manga-to-anime adaptations that has extremely close levels of concise pacing. Small nitpicks aside, not one level of detail is left from the manga, and everything depicted in the anime is an entirely 1-for-1 screenplay of shots. So for manga readers (and any hopefuls wanting to pick up the manga), what you see and read in the manga, the anime does a heck of a plentiful and focused job adapting Looseboy&#039;s source material, and props to series composer Fumihiko Shimo for paying attention and re-enacting to the precise T.<br />
<br />
ANN&#039;s Steve Jones commented this: &quot;Talentless Nana is the Heybot! of Death Note.&quot; And I have to say that he is absolutely right, because director Shinji Ishihira directed both shows (save for the old-school &quot;Shr(i)ek&quot; that was Fairy Tail and the radiance of Log Horizon), and his directorial duty shines even brighter now with Talentless Nana at studio Bridge. Capturing the intricate details of the manga for such a low budget studio is no easy task, and combining the easy-going Heybot! setting with the psychological-thriller suspense of a screenplay, it&#039;s as the cool kids say: it&#039;s (consistently) Poggers.<br />
<br />
In addition, the music and voice-acting is the extra layer to top to what is (IMO) already a pretty good show, even further. Miyu Tomita&#039;s OP &quot;Broken Sky&quot; is a great opening to get you invested into the nuances of the by-parallels of the various scene-shots (that kinda spoils the entire show in general, but not by much). What&#039;s even better is Chiai Fujikawa&#039;s ED, having performed for Shield Hero&#039;s EDs and the 1st ED of Digimon Adventure (2020), her musical class only keeps going up and higher. That&#039;s a few roles to take in for such a young 25-year-old music artist, but another masterful composition of a song that only raises her popularity even more. Not forgetting some notable veteran VAs that excel this show to new heights: Nana&#039;s VA Rumi Ookubo (to which Nana is a +1 to her well-played pink-haired repertoire), Kyouya&#039;s VA Yuuichi Nakamura (the king of SoL male MC) and Michiru&#039;s VA Mai Nakahara (part-total psychopath of Higurashi&#039;s Rena, part-sweet mother of Clannad&#039;s Nagisa). Honestly, a terrific job well done.<br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;m not here to judge your tastes whether you consider Talentless Nana a boon or bane, it&#039;s either that you love the hell or hate the unrealistic ways of the show. Regardless of the insane amounts of &quot;forced&quot; plot twists and cliffhangers that left you wanting for more, I&#039;m here to give an alternate view of why I think this show is &quot;beneficial&quot; to the current times, and only picking up after Among Us got famous overnight. Yeah sure, you can process it as a &quot;marketing ploy&quot;, anything goes.<br />
<br />
If you like it, then hey, fancy a mystery thriller? If not, I&#039;ll foreword with the cliché of &quot;there is better shows out there that&#039;d pique your interest more.&quot;

    *This review contains spoilers.*<br />
<br />
Talentless Nana is an ugly show about a class of braindead kids with superpowers; one by one, they get murdered by the titular psychopath. It&#039;s a reverse murder mystery, meaning you have to figure out how Nana will plan a murder without being caught—rather than identifying the killer.<br />
<br />
The premise is interesting, but the execution is disappointing. Nana&#039;s plans to murder each student rely on their stupidity to succeed. Unfortunately, the show also lacks the gore or humor to be mindless entertainment—and it&#039;s too dull to be worth watching. You barely get to see anything of the killings, except for a few dead

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370183">
        bodies. Lame. At first, I didn&#039;t like it because of the abundance of plot conveniences. Around the middle, I became used to it and enjoyed seeing dumb people get killed. By the end, I was tired of the same formula. It overused cliffhangers until I stopped caring about what would happen next week. In the end, it attempted a last-ditch effort to be profound and memorable. It was so forced and melodramatic—yet not even bad enough to be ironically funny. In a nutshell, this is a decent time-waster but ultimately disappointing.<br />
<br />
The story takes place in the far future. A small percentage of humans are born with superpowers known as the &quot;Talented,&quot; and without them are the &quot;Talentless.&quot; For five years, a war was waged between the Talented and the Talentless. Cities were bombed to ashes in an attempt to genocide superpowered people. The Talented fought against the government because they didn&#039;t want to be the country&#039;s lab rats. They were stigmatized because some of them had dangerous and uncontrollable powers. Decades later, the Talented were accepted, but they&#039;re isolated from normal humans.<br />
<br />
You&#039;ve probably heard of this premise before in great stories like X-Men and Watchmen. In Talentless Nana, the superpowered high school students get sent to &quot;training academies&quot; on secluded islands. Once there, the government sends an assassin to the academy to murder every student. One of those assassins is Nana.<br />
<br />
The plot that ensues is a cat and mouse game between Nana, a pink-haired serial killer, and Kyouya, one of her superpowered classmates. In the same vein as Death Note, she is the villain-protagonist in a battle of wits against a cold and apathetic detective. They play mind games with each other like Light and L, but it&#039;s dumbed down for a teenage audience. Nana&#039;s thoughts are tinted blood-red hue, and Kyouya&#039;s are blue. So red is bad, blue is good—very simplistic symbolism, of course. We wouldn&#039;t want the children to get confused about who&#039;s the ruthless murder or the detective.<br />
<br />
Nana and Kyouya&#039;s inner monologues are meant to be taken very seriously, but they&#039;re so cheesy it&#039;s hard not to laugh. When Nana&#039;s red filter covers the screen, she switches to her Evil Voice, and we get a close-up of her crazed face, wearing a comically evil grin. Whenever a monologue happens, the pace grinds to a halt. Still, we need them. If you removed every monologue, all we&#039;d have is a poorly animated high school murder mystery with lots of awkward pauses and angsty teens. Studio Bridge struggled to adapt the inner monologues. The entire scene freezes in place, like a PowerPoint presentation. The director awkwardly framed all of these shots; you can see where the text box would be. It felt like I was watching actors read pages from the manga rather than an actual anime.<br />
<br />
While watching Talentless Nana, it&#039;s obvious the writer expects us to be idiots. He used heavy-handed monologues to describe things we could figure out through simple observations. We&#039;re not babbling babies. Don&#039;t spoon-feed us obvious information. Over explaining simple things doesn&#039;t make them intelligent. Nana&#039;s plans to murder her classmates are so logically flawed; it seems like the author assumed we wouldn&#039;t notice his lazy writing. There&#039;s no fear that Nana is in danger because the writer made sure everything would work in her favor. If she&#039;s attacked and pushed onto the ground, she&#039;ll find a weapon on the floor. Her plans rely entirely on her classmates&#039; mental deficiencies. Everything could fall apart if just one of them had a brain cell rattling around in their empty heads.<br />
<br />
I want to be clear, don&#039;t expect this to be anything like Death Note. That would be like hoping for a beef sirloin only to get a stick of bubble gum. Although this anime has some exciting twists, the plot is directionless, and it&#039;s ridiculously unbelievable how Nana gets away with murder. It happens time after time—a new student gets introduced, Nana plots to kill them, then she attempts her murder. Her victims range from smooth brained kids one through ten. They&#039;re bullies, creeps, idiots, and unlucky schmucks who had it coming anyway. It&#039;s hard to tell if the show wants us to feel bad for the victims because all of them are unlikeable. Inevitably their superpowers become their entire personality. Many of them were just blank-faced nobodies, wandering around the school looking like ghosts. <br />
<br />
None of the students deserve to die. They&#039;re just stupid kids, not terrorists like Nana seems to think they are. Nana is far more dangerous than any superpowered student because she hides behind her false identity as a mind reader. After the first kill, you begin to wonder, &quot;Huh, how has no one realized that everyone who gets close to Nana dies?&quot; They&#039;re that dumb. I lost my mind when a student discovered a photo of Nana murdering someone, then proceeded not to tell a single person. <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t stand &quot;thrillers&quot; where all kinds of horrible things happen because all the characters are either too stupid to catch on or too cowardly to do anything about it. The whole &quot;manipulative sociopath&quot; premise only works when the surrounding characters are of believable intelligence. There&#039;s not one brain cell between the entire student body. Check out Kyouya in particular. This moron plays the detective role in the show. He has overwhelming evidence that she&#039;s evil, but he doesn&#039;t stop her. At this point, a reasonable person would take matters into their own hands, yet he chooses not to. His excuse is, &quot;No one will believe me because she&#039;s more popular.&quot; For some reason, he never realizes he could simply use his superpower to stop her with force.<br />
<br />
The anime&#039;s saving grace is Nana, who balances charm, mischievousness, and psychotic undercurrents. Her sociopathic &quot;All these kids are devils&quot; persona is cringe-inducing, but it&#039;s fun to laugh at her. Towards the end, her black heart softens, making the only emotional scenes in the show. It&#039;s fun to see her maniacally outsmart Kyouya, but there&#039;s not much to her. I wish she had some development before the final minute of episode 13. Her backstory is super predictable, but at least it explains her motivations. Still, Nana&#039;s decision are unbelievably convoluted. She was sent to the island by an anonymous government bureau to kill students who have done nothing wrong.<br />
<br />
We&#039;ve made it this far, but I still want to know one thing. What exactly does Talentless Nana wish to be? A satire of superhero shounen anime? A black comedy? A cheesy slasher? Death Note for babies? It seems like all of these ideas inspired the writer, yet he couldn&#039;t settle on one. As a result, it can&#039;t choose which target to aim for, so it hits none.<br />
<br />
The commentary on superheroes boils down to a straightforward question, as Nana said, &quot;Anyone who attains superpowers without any efforts will always become arrogant… If we let immature humans with immature psyches have superpowers, would the world survive?&quot; It&#039;s a thought-provoking idea, but not in this anime.<br />
<br />
Talentless Nana doesn&#039;t have the campy slasher thrills I was hoping for, mostly because it&#039;d rather waste time pretending to be profound. In attempting to tell a complex, morally gray story of an ice-cold spy and her ethical compromises, the anime became an awfully complicated story about forgiving a killer who doesn&#039;t deserve anyone&#039;s sympathy. The people who will say this is well-written have cut the writer a LOT of slack, or simply don&#039;t care about its flaws. The cringe levels here are unlimited, and the art quality is almost as bad as the plot. If you want to watch this, do so as a drinking game. Every time you cringe, take a shot. You&#039;ll be shit-faced by the end.

    [Note: This will have an insane amount of spoiler so people who don&#039;t want that stay away from this]<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t like to review shows that aren&#039;t completed coz who knows what&#039;s gonna happen next episode. Maybe 1 twist can make me fan of the anime that I hated before and vice-versa. But I am actually forced to review this anime coz I am so annoyed by the positive review this anime has which also contains some 9/10.People really thinks this is GREAT anime ? and one review even said this is a hidden gem of this season. Like WTF ? First thing first this anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review362354">
        is kind&#039;a popular to call it hidden gem and second thing if this anime is gem then gem nowadays has no fkcing value. <br />
This is gonna be more like me ranting and bashing on this series than the review. But still lets start.<br />
<br />
First thing I would like to point out before I start my rant. The first episode of this anime is actually really good. It starts off as a total My Hero Academia rip off. The world which is assaulted by the monsters called &#039;&#039;Enemy of Humanity&#039;&#039; and to stop that the teenagers with supernatural powers are gathered who are called &#039;&#039; The Talented &#039;&#039; in an school and one of them is Nakajima Nanao who has almost no friend coz almost every author wants to make the characters generic asf. One day a girl named Nana Hiiragi transfers in their school who has the power to read mind and she befriends our guy Nanao. For almost the entirety of the first episode the boy named Nakajima Nanao is presented as the main character of the story. But at the final minute of the episode 1 it is revealed that Nana is actually the main character of the story after she is revealed as the serial killer with no super power who wants to kill all of the &#039;&#039; Enemy of Humanity &#039;&#039; which she thinks are &#039;&#039; The Talented &#039;&#039; people. And it was revealed that she has no superpowers. Her mind reading power is fake and she just has good deductive skills and by using her GIGA BRAIN she will kill every talented student in the school.<br />
<br />
And my god I loved that episode. I thought It was gonna be the child of My Hero Academia X Death Note. But my god I was wrong. It is one of the most frustrating shows I have seen in  while. Characters are total fools who probably have the brain in their ass.<br />
<br />
First thing. Nana is first shown as a girl with power to read mind and she even demonstrate her skills for 2 or 3 times in the class. And after it was revealed that she has no such power. Most of the demonstrations she did in the class looks absolutely illogical. Every student thinks Nana has mind reading power and she don&#039;t even need to hear what other says to know what they are gonna say. But still she asks questions like &#039;&#039; What are you trying to say ? , What are you saying etc a lot of times which definitely means she couldn&#039;t read mind. But characters in this anime are so dumbfucks that they will just overlook it. <br />
<br />
Every time a character dies , dies when they are with Nana and still she isn&#039;t the prime suspect. She will say something like &#039;&#039; Oh Enemy of Humanity attacked him from behind and ran away&#039;&#039; and every mfking characters will believe in her. Lets be real if its the first time it is easy to overlook but all of the characters who died were with Nana before they died. And how the fuck Enemy of Humanity only appears infront of Nana and not any other students. How does that makes sense ? If I were in that school no matter what my suspect will be Nana and Nana only coz it is logical and there are enough reasons to suspect her but no one does ( except for 1 guy ). More like most of those students won&#039;t even try to investigate about those cases they won&#039;t give a shit bout their friends dying.<br />
<br />
One character who has power to see future knows Nana is the one killing the guys out there and he even has the proofs but he won&#039;t say anything Why ? coz he wants her as a girlfriend. Okay that was frustrating to even hear. His over confidence in his skills got his killed in the end ( serves him right.) But it was all because of his over confidence not the smartness of Nana so it doesn&#039;t shows us about how Nana will kill those bastards even tho she is powerless which is the main focus of the story.<br />
<br />
Every time Nana kills a character she just gets away with it not because she leaves no traces behind and she always use 100% safe tactics but people just don&#039;t care and are just dumb. Using her innocent face and some crocodile tears she is always able to make other believe in her. And every fucking characters believes in her even tho it is obvious Nana has something to do with the guys dying.<br />
I have a 9 yrs old brother and I must say my brother is 2x more smarter than the characters in this anime.<br />
If I were in that school this anime would&#039;ve ended in ep 2 coz with the things that are happening after Nana came to school and everytime she is with a character they die. I would suspect only her and even 10 years old kid will have enough brain to suspect her.<br />
<br />
*Art is mediocre.<br />
*Characters are just 1/10. If I could give it lower than 1 I would give it 0.1/10. Stupid shits. More like the most stupid characters in all of anime. <br />
*Story is kind&#039;a good more like it is enough to make me want to watch it.<br />
*Sound is unmemorable. I already forgot almost every OST.<br />
*Main character is an edgy bitch who is smart because other characters are just too dumb.<br />
<br />
Should you watch this anime. Definitely not. Even if you liked Death Note and you are a huge fan of anime like that still don&#039;t watch it. It is one of the most frustrating and stupid anime ever.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading.<br />
Have a good day / night.<br />
I am open to criticisms regarding my review so feel free to comment on my profile.<br />

    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
My god, not even my first break-up when I was a teenie disappointed me like this anime did. I think that the comparisson is pretty accurate. Desilusion, a bad time, the feeling of “why did I keep on with this, when it was such a waste of time?”, and the consequent response of “I wanted to know how this was going to end, or if this can be saved”. All those things are in common.<br />
<br />
Munou na Nana is an anime that began strongly and that had a huge potential but, as you can expect from my rating, this ended up being the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370181">
        whole opposite. The story takes place in an island for special kids (and I’m not only talking about their abilities) that are supposed to protect the earth from the “enemies of humanity”, where there is a school that is a sort of Boku no Hero Academy. And actually, that’s your first impression. Nanao, the human that it’s called the ‘protagonist’, is a talentless guy in a talents school. Later on, is revealed that Nanao is not talentless as such, but a guy with the talent to nullify the other’s talents. At the same time, while you’re told his story and how he suffers because no one knew his secret ability and everybody bullied him because of that (I’m sure the CIA told him to kept it secret in order not to control the world), the new girl in the class makes her apparition and gets along with him, a cheerful annoying girl whose talent is to read minds. I was yawning the entire episode until I watched the end of it, when the thing got spicy. I was amazed and thought that it was a great idea that I made it through the end of it, because my expectations grew after that exact moment when, in the final minutes, Nanao gets apparently killed by the new girl, Nana, letting you know that she is sent by the government in order to destroy and eliminate every enemy of humanity. The interesting part of it, is that the enemies of humanity are, indeed, the students that are caught up in that island and, of course, that place is not to educate them, but to have them separated from the rest of the world so they could be killed in mysterious ways. Excellent way of cheering up the party with this finale and that revelation, isn’t it?<br />
<br />
I waited up for the next episode to release, and I was so excited, but then it declined a little bit. I didn’t lose hope and tried to see the positive out of it, and it kept for the next two episodes. I even wrote and published a preliminary review saying this was going to be great! After the fifth episode, I had to delete it because, at that moment, I didn’t feel any of the positive things I said before. <br />
<br />
The plot continues with Nana killing another classmates, breaking that mask of cute girl from time to time to show her real behavior, having dark thoughts and openly expressing her hate for the other students, of course, when she’s alone. Another thing that was revealed previously is that she has no talent. She can’t read minds, she’s just instructed in body language and is careful enough to understand what’s going on in her surrounding. Suddenly, as more classmates keep disappearing, a  solitary cold guy from her class starts to suspects her and they begin an interesting and indirect war, where both of them try to develope the other’s intentions. At that point, I thought it was still good. But as it progresses and she starts killing indiscriminately, you realize how it gets even stupidier with every episode. Every person dies when she’s with them, and every times she excuses hemself with her fake cutie attitude, by saying that they were attacked by an enemy of humanity (what they believe that are monsters). And that’s it, her sacred word is never doubted, so no one suspects her and no one investigates, and I’m not only talking about Nana, but the school itself, everything is so weird, the professors don’t care at all for their students and neven hear them, and the students don’t even suspect a thing. Sometimes there’s even people that almost witnesses the crime and that, if they had two functional neurons making sinapsis, could easily deduce she was the serial killer. Of course, they don’t. I mean, she kills a stupid guy and, when she’s right next to his body, a stupid girl comes in and asks what happened. This stupid guy that was killed had the ability of premonitions and could keep them as photographs. The stupid girl, while examinating his body, finds out a picture of Nana killing Nanao, and she doesn’t even doubt of her. She just asks “Nana, what’s this?”. <br />
<br />
And this foolishness is repeated every episode. Her classmates never do anything except for Kyouya, the only guy that suspects her and follows her anywhere, and everytime tries to accuse her. He demonstrates in the first episodes that he is smart enough to play the game along with her, but suddenly, after ten episodes and actually knowing she tried to kill him, he still thinks that she can read minds and even gets dazed by her manipulations. Amazing. And that point is important because that makes me real mad because of how nonsensically convenient it is. A lot of times she makes huge mistakes in her ‘minds reading’ and ALWAYS puts the same excuse “haha, I’m sorry, I’m tired and I can’t focus”, and everybody says haha that’s ok. Sometimes, she even says things, by deduction, that every person with those acclaimed neurons could realize by themself, and everybody just gets surprised and reasure she can read minds. I’ve seen secondary characters that are shameful, cringey,  ridiculous or naive, but these are all those adjectives together but multiplied by 2000. It gets to a point where the stupidity of those characters and how blind they are  (that, of course, is a plot convenience) is shooking, illogical, and that you, as a viewer, actually wonder if the human being who made this story is trolling you or just thinking you are as braindead as them. After a little time you even feel insulted. Mangaka-sama, I’m not asking you to write those characters with an IQ of 160, nor to make them capable of beating her in that wit game, I’m just asking for them to, at least, suspect her or to lose trust on her. Nevermind, I’m not even asking for that, I’m begging you to give them a brain. Amen.<br />
<br />
Another poor thing about this anime is how they abuse of cliffhangers. Cliffhangers are great, are surprising, catches your attention and so, but when you use it A LOT, it looses its taste and you already expect it. Every episode is stupid and you are there, knowing that Nana is going to kill twenty students more and no one will ever notice, and you are already waiting for the cliffhanger. And you already know that the next episode, when the cliffhanger is solved, Nana will end up being free and innocent to everybody. Is not only that they abuse of this resource, but they actually never maintain what happens on that cliffhanger, since in the next episode, everything will return back to normal as if the cliffhanger never existed. Why did they make it for, then? Is obvious that they are doing that because they are desperate. Some episodes were boring and, just when you get something interesting, boom! Cliffhanger. After six episodes, they should already know that people are not falling for that anymore. Oh, yeah, I forgot, they think the audience is incredibly stupid.<br />
<br />
After a bunch of episodes of this one-dimensional pseudo yandere simulator and her mental deficient classmates with no personality, you get to know her past and her real personality. She likes mental games, she adores chess and Shogi, she’s a manga reader and her parents were killed, apparently, by an enemy of humanity that climbed up her window when she escaped from home to go get the last volume of her favourite manga at almost midnight. Relatable. When she knew what happened she felt guilty. Nevertheless, she reveals to her only friend in the academy (The stupidiest of them all, a cutie cringey girl whose voice is annoying and that’s the one that defends Nana to death) that, after all those years, she doesn’t even feel sad about it, she doesn’t feel guilt, nor hate, nor regrets. And when I thought that this could be an interesting detail of this character, she starts to think about that incident all the time. Until then she was a cold ass killer that never thought about her parents, and hastily she can’t stop thinking about it and, even though she said two mintes earlier that she doesn’t feel anything for that, she totally contradicts her statement in order for us to feel empathy for her, or that at least we think for one second and in the last two episodes, that she is not plain and hasn’t a poor writing. A lame resource, but it’s not that I was expecting anything from this show right now. <br />
<br />
The rest of the cast… I don’t want to keep defenestrating them since they are poor little humans betrayed by biology itself, who forgot to make a brain for them. Although, I have to make a summary. Kyouya, who I mentioned before, is a guy (with no development at all, of course) who at first hides his talent, but that later demonstrates that his ability is to be inmortal. This is the one who actually had a big potential since he was the only one whose neurons weren’t on a hunger strike at the beginning, but that didn’t last long, because episodes later he started with a nonsensical behavior. The idea was that he wanted to confuse Nana and make her think he trusted her, but it seems that the one that he confuses is, in fact, the viewer. Let’s see: he, at first, suspects her and almost spits that out to her face, and prooves he is not THAT stupid and that he could be at her level. Further on, he starts to make things like trying to be friends with her for no apparent reason. Okay. If we could understand him just by his actions, yes, it’s logical if we are confused (or if we don’t understand his reasons) since we don’t know what he’s planning to do or if it’s all just an acting to keep an eye on her. But no, the anime shows us his thoughts and his reasoning, and that’s where we see that he is actually not planning anything and he is just dumb enough to not realize obvious things. He just behaves like that because of the relief comedy of him not knowing how to make friends and so. And even when he does approaches Nana to investigate her, he gets fooled by her and her “psychic powers”. At the beginning, I thought he was just pretending to be fooled by her, but no, when they show you his thoughts, you really know that he doesn’t have a clue about Nana not having any talent. And is contradictory! By moments he unfolds an entire intelligent deduction, and by moments he is an idiot who doesn’t know where he is standing. Then, what is the point of this? Kyouya is a wasted character who wanted to be a smartass and forgot the first five letters of the word.   <br />
<br />
The rest of the cast is even lamer. Inukai Michiru is the most adorable and stupid of them all, an hypocrite who swears that wants to help and save all the people she can, but that blindly denies that Nana is the one hurting and killing everybody. If she really wanted to make a good, she would, at least, wonder why Nana is always when the assassination takes place, why Nana never lets her heal nor inspect the victims’ bodies, why Kyouya steady accuses Nana, why she found a pic of Nana killing Nanao, if she was that sacred deer she believes she is? Is ridiculous. However, by the last episodes, we also see Michiru’s past and how she and Nana are becoming besties, using Michiru as the moral trigger that pulls Nana over the threads and makes her wonder if she’s doing a good deed in name of humanity, or if she’s just being used and deceived by the government. Of course, despite she’s a smartass that can cheat an entire bunch of obtuse students, she’s slow enough to question her actioning after twelve episodes and several cold kills, but nevermind. We, the audience, are even slower, we’re not gonna notice that flamsy construction, aren’t we?<br />
<br />
After those that I mentioned, I had a headache, so I’m not gonna extend more on this. The rest of the characters are the same and worse. You got a fire guy that is the enemy of an ice guy, you have the bullies, and so. All of them respectfully adore Nana and follow her anywhere. The persons she killed, died because of their non-base-confidence and because of that adoration for her leader (who was chosen as their leader because ‘why not?’). I mean, how can you be so confident when there is a serial killer in the island where you are trapped, and when every classmate of yours is disappearing? Not even one character is compelling nor act in a logical way, in order to ease the task to Nana and to make her look like a great unbeatable character. It’s like feeling strong when you’re winning an arm-wrestling against a one-handed person. Another plot convenience that insults you in the face.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation and sound I don’t have complaints, but I don’t have compliments either. Everything is common and nothing I would recall. Some VA are annoying and some characters design are likeable since they are very different from each other. The uniform is nice, too. They also abuse of the resource of the darkened face when Nana is in a hurry, and abuse even more of the red and blue background, like some sort of cheap Death Note. At first that one was interesting though, but when they use it all the time to leave the Nana’s voice-off, it loses its effect, and it’s worse when they try so hard to make Kyouya fit the blue side, as if he could be a real opponent for Nana. Guess what? He’s not.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, this is a regular animated show with no praising audiovisual work, with flat, awfully silly and absurd characters that will get to your nerves, with a story that started with a really good premise and that ended up in just a “wannabe” with a lot of ridiculous plot armors and the over-use of repetitive resources that were not used as they should. One undeniable thing is that if we need to pass through twelve episodes to say this is worth it, it is definitely not. A plot twist can be good, but there’s no plot twist THAT good to save a whole disaster as big as Munou na Nana. Normally, I try to make a closure that equals bad and good points, but in this anime there’s nothing I can save, so… Don’t. Don’t watch it. Unless you’re as stupid as the public they are aiming with this show, of course, but that’s up to you.<br />

    Let&#039;s discuss a topic people like to bring up: stupid and allegedly stupid decisions by the characters, especially some side characters, and whether this counts as luck, plot armor, or whatever. The answer is nuanced. Much of the alleged stupidity is actually deep ignorance, which is different, and the ignorance has been caused on purpose. It is revealed very early on.<br />
<br />
First, a general point: If you follow the full narrative, it is very clear that people irrationally believing in propaganda and other convenient lies is intentional. It is even clearer if you read the manga.<br />
<br />
&quot;Humans don&#039;t believe the truth. They believe people.&quot;<br />
&quot;People believe what they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370184">
        want to believe and hear what they want to hear.&quot;<br />
<br />
It is not a bug; it is a feature. The author is trying to make a point here, and he is not trying to hide it. Call it social commentary if you like. More about that below.<br />
<br />
If you abuse existing misinformation and other characters&#039; motives, it isn&#039;t really plot armor. It is not as though you need additional coincidences for it, aside from the existence of the misinformation and the motives in the first place. Sure, some of the characters are legitimately too trusting or have issues with their mental health. ...Which can still sometimes be suboptimal writing, but that is different than plot armor. Not to mention, several of the events and beliefs are 1) explained in greater detail later on or 2) setups for future plot points with interesting payoffs. This doesn&#039;t apply to nearly everything, but sometimes you should be patient and try to look at the narrative as a whole.<br />
<br />
Well, let&#039;s go over some points and hope it won&#039;t turn into a full essay.<br />
<br />
<br />
[Obligatory spoiler alert, though I will try to avoid saying the biggest spoilers outright. There will be many mid-sized spoilers though.]<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Blaming the Enemies of Humanity<br />
<br />
In Among Us and also in Danganronpa, for instance, the players and the characters are immediately told that there are killers among them. That is the premise. Here that is not the case, and there are potential scapegoats, most notably the dreaded &quot;Enemies of Humanity.&quot; Original name, I know. (Nice troll, author.) <br />
<br />
Anyway, these aliens conveniently happen to be invisible or be able to influence people&#039;s minds, or at least that is what many characters believe. And why is that? Because the belief has been perpetuated by decades of government propaganda, all the way down to their textbooks. Often you don&#039;t even need to suggest to them that the Enemies of Humanity are at fault; they will recite their textbooks and general knowledge and come up with the idea by themselves. This is a central part of the premise that was established immediately, and even before the events of the series, most of the characters had assumed that these aliens were already on the island, so of course that is their default explanation for problems. In the absence of strong evidence to the contrary, they will believe the alien option. Imagine a story in which the characters genuinely fight against aliens. If a few of them die, would their first assumption be blaming a human killer? No, that would be the wrong genre. Though usually the aliens are not quite as well hidden. <br />
<br />
Is it dumb to believe in government propaganda and conspiracy theories? Sure. It says something about people&#039;s poor critical reading skills. But that is only to be expected. Mankind is dumb like that. Look at the conspiracy theories tens of millions of real-life people believe in with far lesser propaganda efforts, not to mention their belief in all kinds of entities without empirical evidence.<br />
<br />
Keeping that in mind, they are mostly reasonable in not assuming that there is a grand government conspiracy out to get them. Come on, that can&#039;t be real, right? There is seemingly no evidence of it. So if that particular conspiracy happens to be real, they are walking into it blind. Good job with the brainwashing, shady government conspirators. There is a nice quote about it later on. &quot;People believe what they want to believe and hear what they want to hear. ... How would that benefit them?&quot; (I omitted a part there to tone down the spoilers.) Incidentally, the idea of mind-controlling aliens is also a setup for a future plot point. It has some ironic payoff that I don&#039;t want to spoil too much. <br />
<br />
2) Suspicious alien attack<br />
<br />
Stabbed by an invisible alien? Suspicious, right? Yes, but if you have been indoctrinated into believing that invisible aliens are a thing, less so. And there was no apparent motive for the self-stabbing anyway, so figuring it out required several logical steps that indoctrinated people would not bother to take. Still, Kyoya rightfully points out that it is suspicious that it retreated after a single attack, and he isn&#039;t wrong, but let&#039;s think about it for a minute. If the best this alien can do is a relatively weak stab attack, and the building is full of super-powered humans about to rush in, retreating might not be a bad idea. Even if it is invisible, it isn&#039;t hard to guess where it is if it tries to stab people. But maybe it would opt to self-sacrifice to take out the mind-reader, probably a big threat. That would have been an interesting argument for Kyoya to make.<br />
<br />
3) Why not reveal everything to the class the moment you learn the truth?<br />
<br />
Without evidence? That wouldn&#039;t go so well. And they lacked evidence, with the exception of Tsunekichi. (More about that below.) Second, for many of them, it would not have helped them achieve their goals. I am not going to go through each person&#039;s motives individually.<br />
<br />
4) Just ask her to read your mind<br />
<br />
It happens multiple times during the series, and there are plausible ways out of them. And there apparently are convenient limitations to her mind-reading ability. Nana states that she cannot reliably focus on specific thoughts or parse very specific pieces of information from them, including particular strings of letters or numbers such as passwords. Also, the presence of many people creates background noise that can cover the target&#039;s thoughts.<br />
<br />
And it is not as though the students are constantly badgering each other to show off their powers. Even with a mind-reader it is natural to primarily try to have a normal conversation. Would you really ask them to focus on your thoughts instead of talking? Then they might find out things that you don&#039;t want them to, and it would be considered rude regardless.<br />
<br />
5) Precognitive photos<br />
<br />
Tsunekichi had strong empirical reasons to trust the accuracy of the photos. He had tried to defy them before, but it had never worked. What was dumb was not anticipating what was done with the photos, though it was true that the tampered material had not been handed over voluntarily, which made it seem more plausible. The way his character was written, it seems that his fatalism had turned him so passive and uncaring of anything that he could barely be bothered to take any measures to protect himself. He is someone who had given up on actively living his life for the most part. So I guess you can substitute stupidity for mental illness.<br />
<br />
By the way, here is a possible interpretation of how the photos work:<br />
<br />
It seems clear that the predictions made by the photos take into consideration how the characters react to those photos. Tsunekichi was refusing to head to the murder scene before the photos were tampered with, and that happened because of the existence of the initial photos. Nothing that happens to fulfill the photos ever seems to violate normal laws of physics. The conditions just happen to be right for the outcomes.<br />
<br />
So the events had to progress roughly the way they did because otherwise the pictures would not have come true, and they had to come true. The events played out as they did because the characters are who they are. It is not as though we should assume that people have metaphysical free wills. Their actions are predictable, at least by some superpowers that can make normally impossible calculations.<br />
<br />
If Tsunekichi was the kind of person who would reveal the information to the class or would figure out that the fake photo was fake, he likely would not have got the photos in the first place because then the existence of the photos likely would have prevented those events, and he only gets photos that come true. He could have got a different set of incriminating photos though. If this is the case, what actually ruined Tsunekichi was his fatalism because that is what lead him to behave as he did.<br />
<br />
Tl;dr: It is all about causality and determinism. (Let&#039;s not get into a quantum mechanics fight in this context, please.)<br />
<br />
6) Mind-reading the spirits of the deceased<br />
<br />
&quot;But that is not how mind-reading works!&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, how does mind-reading work in real life then? Let alone in this fictional world? Yeah, I thought so. Also, they were already doing necromancy in the same room; speaking to the spirit of the corpse is only a few more steps beyond that. Some talents can be broad and multi-purpose, developing into slightly different directions than what you&#039;d initially expect. This seems especially apparent after reading the manga further. That doesn&#039;t mean that the ability can&#039;t be too convenient in that particular situation. That applies to many other talents though, including the necromancy that was literally going on in the same room.<br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t about tactics, but I did find the irony pretty funny. It is adding insult to injury: first the person gets killed, and then people are pretending to speak on behalf of his spirit.<br />
<br />
7) No autopsy<br />
<br />
Tsunekichi was running around telling everyone about the girlfriend thing, so her being the victim of blackmail, assault, etc. was very plausible, most of which was actually true. If she had killed him, it would have probably been by stabbing or blunt trauma, but there were no signs of those. And in that case, she would have openly admitted to self-defence. (The method of killing was the reason against that option.)<br />
<br />
8) No zombie &quot;autopsy&quot;<br />
<br />
People were crept out by the necromancy and allegedly Tsunekichi&#039;s suffering on top of that. The decision comes down to how willing they are to torture Tsunekichi&#039;s soul to maybe learn about the Enemies of Humanity. I could see them not caring about him and going through with it anyway, so it is reasonable to argue that it was out of character for some of them. You can call it dumb if you like, or being too kind-hearted. It is not ruthlessly efficient, for sure. Maybe Kyoya would have liked to go through with it anyway, but the others would have dragged him out of the room if necessary.<br />
<br />
9) Letting a captive free in exchange for help<br />
<br />
Letting another character free in exchange for letting them use their talent to &quot;speak&quot; to their loved one beyond the grave. That isn&#039;t plot armor though, more like emotionally manipulating people by abusing their romantic feelings and state of mind. First of all, she was not planning to kill her captive at that point anyway, and only decided on that later. Exposing everything to the class wouldn&#039;t work because of the lack of evidence. She should have taken more precautions though. Barricading the door, for instance. Though it was plausible, given the state of mind of the person in question. But still, barricade the door. Then they probably would have had to talk their way out of it.<br />
<br />
10) &quot;Barricading&quot; in a shed<br />
<br />
The point of the plan is that it wears the opponent down and makes her easier to find while also lowering the chance of her exposing anything to the class. (Not that she had any evidence, and it would have run contrary to her motive anyway.) The time of sunrise was not a deus ex machina because it is easily predictable. The real problem was whether sunlight would deactivate the zombies. Even though it was very likely that sunlight had some effect, judging by the time of day a particular zombie appeared in school, it was not certain that all zombies are equally affected, and furthermore it was possible that the sunlight worked on the zombies too slowly. If they immediately went on a full assault, maybe there would have been enough time to get something done. There was the threat of a hypothetical trap, but still. <br />
<br />
11) Blindly following the leader<br />
<br />
Yes, it is dumb to blindly follow charismatic leaders, but that is what people do. They follow their Great Leaders and trust their words. Look around and read the news. People are actually pretty dumb in that sense.<br />
<br />
12) Not seeing through facades in general<br />
<br />
Yes, it is dumb to let yourself be too easily influenced by a nice smile, kind demeanor, and convenient words. People are dumb like that. Well, I suppose realism isn&#039;t everything in fiction though. Narratively, many of the scenes are supposed to be about emotional manipulation instead of foolproof game-theoretical solutions. And you don&#039;t really see the latter pretty much anywhere in fiction; you pretty much only get impossible predictions and unlikely coincidences, with a few exceptions. There is of course room for improvement in the manipulation department too, though it was still very amusing to see. <br />
<br />
13) Too often near the victims<br />
<br />
Well, three times as far as most characters think. Still, it creates more suspicion, as mentioned several times and especially addressed during the events of episodes 4 and 8. Not to mention that being the leader puts her in contact with more people, which makes her a likely witness. This was stated multiple times.<br />
<br />
14) Michiru is gullible and trusts her friends too much<br />
<br />
Literally canon. Even the narrative openly acknowledges it. It was done on purpose because it is used in a few later plot points. In the case of the incriminating photo, there is also the additional point that based on earlier photos, it seemed that they could indeed be inaccurate. It still should have rung alarm bells though.<br />
<br />
15) Why not call the phone instead of a body search?<br />
<br />
Sounds and other alerts can be turned off, you know. It might be worth a shot though because it is not like there is any downside to it, even if the chances of it working are low.<br />
<br />
16) Why don&#039;t they simply have the military level the island?<br />
<br />
Explained in episode 2. They have to know enough about the abilities first, and even if you ask them first, they won&#039;t always be honest. And an all-out assault may be too apparent, and word might get out. It is still an option if all else fails.<br />
<br />
17) Why doesn&#039;t the school take the deaths and disapperances more seriously?<br />
<br />
Remember what the purpose of the school is. Why would they? The idea of having them stay on the island is addressed a bit more closely later on anyway. And they did halt the classes when the corpses of the victims started showing up.<br />
<br />
18) Why don&#039;t they halt the classes the moment some people stop showing up for class?<br />
<br />
Then they would never have class because they keep skipping class anyway.<br />
<br />
19) Why don&#039;t the students take more action?<br />
<br />
The moment victims start appearing, they increasingly go hide in their rooms. Gathering everyone in one place or trying to leave the island would be problematic too. That said, some of them are not barricading in hard enough, and you can see the result. On the other hand, isolating too much can make it easier to be picked off one by one, especially if there really is an alien menace or a third-party killer around. They could set up a system for keeping tabs on each other in some organized way, not that it would be foolproof. If you try to move around in groups, people will be reluctant to do so if they can&#039;t trust the other members. This is even more of a problem if there really are mind-controlling aliens who can influence people with weak psyches. Then people really would bunker down in their rooms, whether it is rational or not. Giving Nana some kind of security escort would have been a good idea though.<br />
<br />
20) Just go look for the aliens<br />
<br />
By wandering in the woods in small groups? Or burning down the woods altogether? I suppose they could do so, not that it would help much against invisible aliens. They could also attack spam in a systematic way and see if they manage to land lucky hits. I think barricading in their rooms is the more likely action they would take though.<br />
<br />
21) Should have done more research<br />
<br />
This is a great idea, actually. The schemes would have been more effective if they had done much more research into the characters&#039; abilities beforehand. And they probably should have. The downside is that it gives the enemies more time to organize, as was about to happen, but it probably would have been worth it anyway.<br />
<br />
22) How about not revealing that you are a mind-reader and leaving the talent question open?<br />
<br />
Not a terrible idea because several students do that. It comes with its pros and cons though. It makes you appear more suspicious because people will be cautious of your unknown ability. Though mind-reading is already quite powerful in its own way. Not revealing it also removes the chance to tell people the helpful &quot;info&quot; that mind-reading brings. And if mind-reading is only your fallback option, people will be upset that they only learned about it afterwards.<br />
<br />
23) The schemes are too simple<br />
<br />
Simple schemes are actually more effective. Why would you want your schemes to be so complex that you need multiple flowcharts? In real life, you can&#039;t predict other people&#039;s actions with arbitrary precision. The kinds of schemes that rely on outrageous predictions against astronomical odds will probably fail. Of course, there are many works of fiction (including quite a few anime, manga, light novels, visual novels, etc.) in which characters carry out such predictions and are lauded as geniuses. But they are not actually geniuses because the works do not present the actual means to carry out those predictions. Here the plans are plausible to construct. <br />
<br />
Here the narrative at least presents plausible and semi-plausible explanations for the events instead of the usual completely arbitrary impossible predictions and very unlikely coincidences. I would rather take flawed human reasoning than the kind of reasoning that is impossible for anyone except the omniscient. Yes, I prefer characters to be fallible humans than perfect (or &quot;perfect&quot;) god-like entities.<br />
<br />
<br />
So what is this series actually about? Good and evil. Not &quot;the good heroes vs the evil monsters&quot; kind but the more nuanced kind in which characters sometimes actually think about their moral decisions.<br />
<br />
We get something with visceral malice, dysfunctional conscience, effective dark comedy, heaps of deception and irony, and surprisingly interesting dialogue. How despicable actions can you carry out until your conscience kicks in? Anything and everything, or is there a limit? And what kind of strain will this place on your future interactions with people? If you keep lying repeatedly, how difficult it will be to convince someone when you are actually telling the truth? As a result, the drama is actually dramatic and the comedy is actually funny. The quality of the dialogue is also surprisingly high, especially including the protagonist&#039;s inner thoughts. It is written in a witty way, juxtaposing a facade of seemingly simple lines with more analytical, viscerally heavy-hitting dialogue that tramples on the appearances. Meanwhile, the plot is regularly throwing twists at the reader, and some of them can actually be surprising, which is not something that happens all that often.<br />
<br />
Now, some people call this series a &quot;Death Note clone&quot; or &quot;Among Us + My Hero Academia,&quot; but I actually think it is something else. Those interpretations may have been effective at spreading word of this series and granting convenient titles to videos on Youtube, but they are also somewhat misleading. This series doesn&#039;t have to be Death Note or Among Us. It can be its own thing, and it is better that it is its own thing instead of trying to mimic those other options too closely. For instance, I don&#039;t think it is trying to be about outrageously complex mind games with characters somehow predicting dozens of moves ahead. It is more about the moral weight of murder, deception, manipulating public opinion, and exploiting people&#039;s weaknesses, and all the long-term consequences that come with those actions.<br />
<br />
There is actual moral tension, shifting moral alignments in a relatively believable way, a powerful sense of hatred and malice, dynamic character relationships strained by past deeds, and tons of delicious irony. The character relationships and interactions can be more dynamic than might appear at first. All of this also results in nice dark comedy that goes far beyond the norm. It blends in well with the drama and doesn&#039;t feel out of place.<br />
<br />
The dark comedy really is very delicious here. I often found myself laughing at the ironic deception, the thinly veiled threats, the outrageous juxtaposition between cheerful and dark thoughts, the dissonance between people&#039;s outward behavior and inner thoughts, and the relationships strained by what happened many episodes ago. It hasn&#039;t been marked with the comedy tag, but who cares? It fits my sense of humor better than most comedy I&#039;ve seen in anime, manga, light novels, etc. There is also meta-commentary and subversion of various common tropes. Seemingly generic heroic characters end up as something different, and tropes related to generic main characters are showcased, then brutally subverted.<br />
<br />
A few of the characters eat up the vast majority of focus, development, and the best dialogue. But better a few good characters than none at all. And the characters should often be introduced more organically, longer before their main role is played out.<br />
<br />
The voice actors did a great job here, Nana&#039;s especially. I also liked many of the facial expressions, the color-coding for inner monologue, and some suitably over-the-top visual choices like non-existent wind indoors for a big mental showdown, complete with dramatic music. The opening and ending songs are catchy, the opening especially, and the lyrics for both are very fitting. By which I mean that they are nightmarish in a personal, knife-in-the-heart kind of way.

    At start of the season I read synopses of this series and concluded that this series is trash which I don&#039;t need to watch. It got boring cover, boring MC and everything seemed like trash. Later on someone said that this is best shows in season with Majo no Tabitabi. I was really curious why someone would say something like that. <br />
<br />
So, I started to watch first episode. It was so boring. Generic shonen male protagonist in generic setting and then there was this generic pink haired potential love interest for that generic protagonist. I was bored in halfway of episode. I was so close

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361422">
        to dropping it that point. But the ending was something totally different. Whole episode flipped like Gakkougurashi! I was hooked in instant. I watched rest of episodes after that.<br />
<br />
This series is sooo good! This psychological thriller is going to be instant classic like Higurash or Gakkougurashi! <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t want to say much so I don&#039;t spoil anyone but it is really rare to see anime like this one.<br />

    *No spoilers* Read the edit at the end<br />
<br />
This anime... dayum, was I not expecting this. It&#039;s a real breath of fresh air. Honestly, it&#039;s a hidden gem<br />
<br />
In terms of story, most of the 1st episode seems pretty lackluster. Even the synopsis on MAL is pretty repulsive... At first, it seems like a cliché story about your typical shounen MC who somehow has a &quot;useless&quot; power that&#039;s in some way super broken<br />
Everything makes you want to drop this anime but the author saved this series with a last minute switcharoo - honestly, I won&#039;t spoil what happens, but the whole plot turns upside down and the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361274">
        whole focus of the story becomes a totally different person. From then on, with each following episode it keeps surpassing my expectations. If you like mystery, plotting, psychological, a very calculating MC, you&#039;ll love this<br />
<br />
In terms of characters, it seems a bit goofy at first but it gets a lot better on the second episode and forwards. But let&#039;s be honest, a lot of the characters are a bit dumb - considering they&#039;re highschoolers, I&#039;ll let it pass<br />
<br />
The art is good for your average anime but don&#039;t expect Ufotable or KyotoAni level of animation<br />
<br />
The ost works really well with the show, can&#039;t complain about it. It&#039;s not the type of OST that&#039;ll make you remember it, but it fits well with the atmosphere and the story<br />
<br />
The voice acting, specially from the pink haired girl is phenomenal from episode 2 and forwards; I also love the white haired guy&#039;s voice acting<br />
<br />
In summary, give this anime a try!! I haven&#039;t had such a breath of fresh air in a long time. The concept of the story is really really different from what you were expecting. GIVE IT A TRY, at the least the first and second episodes, you won&#039;t regret it! And it gets even better in the third. Essentially, it&#039;s a fun watch<br />
<br />
Edit: after having watched the most recent episodes (12), it gets a bit, or should I say very dumb. It&#039;s still a fun watch but it&#039;s kinda disappointing considering how much potential it had. I revoke my previous score and give it an overall score of 6/10

    By now you’ve probably heard Munou na Nana described as the “among us” anime. While this doesn’t completely sum up the series, it’s a pretty good introduction to the world.<br />
<br />
I’ll preface by saying Munou na Nana is one of the only manga I actively enjoy reading these days. So when I found out that it was getting an anime adaptation I had pretty high expectations for the series. I believe those expectations were met and came away with this in my top four shows of the season. <br />
<br />
What makes this series so special for me is that Nana is a morally grey character. A lot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370251">
        of times we tend to see the world as right and wrong, black and white, etc., when in reality it’s usually grey. Everyone is evil from someone’s point of view, and this anime and manga really test your ability to accept other perspectives. If you judge Nana from the perspective of her classmates, you will find her to be an evil character. If you put yourself in her shoes, you see that things are not quite that simple.<br />
<br />
On top of the moral ambiguity, the arc that the anime covers is really a battle of wits. It’s Nana vs Kyoya as she races to complete her task of eliminating the students, while he gradually closes in on her. I think the tension between the two throughout the season is amazing. The internal monologues that detail the characters’ strategies that allow you to gain an insight and understand their actions really well. There’s no leaps in logic because everything is explained to you piece by piece. I’ve never seen it, but I’ve been told there’s a lot of similarities between Nana and Death Note in this regard, so if you liked that, you’d probably like this.<br />
<br />
Art and animation are solid enough. This isn’t a battle shonen, so I don’t expect super fluid animation, but when needed it’s more than adequate. I thought the OP performed by Tomita MIyu was one of the best of the season and the ED is my pick for ED of the season. I thought the OST in general was well put together. <br />
<br />
In the end, the mental and tactical warfare between Nana and Kyoya provided 12 weeks of consistent entertainment. On more than one occasional you’ll be forced to reconsider whose side you’re on and what’s right and wrong. adapdation wise, I have no issues with the anime, so based on my love of the manga, Munou na Nana gets 10 watches out of 10.

    Nana is honestly a surprise. I&#039;m loving it honestly, to the point I&#039;ve even started reading the Manga because of it. That&#039;s just how much I&#039;m enjoying it. Here is why!<br />
<br />
The anime starts off like a typical setting you&#039;d see in most shows, with a simple setting of heroes and a villain to face. Pretty standard stuff, which isn&#039;t bad, but it lays the groundwork for what is to come. It&#039;s a genuine surprise when it happens, and it becomes a completely different show then previously imagined. It went from an anime that could be seen as alright, or good watch, to being one of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361365">
        the stand outs of the season honestly. You&#039;ll love it from start, to it&#039;s eventual finish. It&#039;s first few episodes have shown that, and I cannot wait to watch more as the story goes along. <br />
<br />
The characters are a mixed bag so far, some are bland, but others are obvious stand outs, and seem to have most of the attention and for good reason, to help push the plot along. Both are very good, as it&#039;s good to have characters to fit a certain element, but also have great leading characters to like and get behind. Not that the more background cast are bad, but more the focus is on certain characters than others. Which is perfectly fine by any means. Mainly our pink haired girl herself in Nana, whom can be seen at first as a typical cute and happy go lucky girl, but that is oh so far from the truth. Which is great.<br />
<br />
The art is simple, but it&#039;s colourful, and well detailed in parts. Not off putting at all, along with the sounds making the atmospheres when needed look good, and very fitting for what it&#039;s delivering. Very good on all parts. I can already picture that certain scenes that I already know about are gonna look great when it comes to this style. Very well done here.<br />
<br />
This show is honestly one of my faves of the season. I&#039;m keeping up with it and love it a ton, so check it out!

    [ There are going to be some massive spoilers in this review as it’s impossible to criticize this show without giving away massive plot points]<br />
<br />
Talentless Nana is a wasted potential if I ever saw one. It builds up everything in its favour in the first episode, only to discard it in the subsequent ones.  Although the concept works, the execution and the characters, especially the characters, don’t.<br />
<br />
The show is a murder mystery, but not for us. We already know “whodunnit” in the first episode, but the characters don’t. It’s set in a world where some children manifest superhuman abilities, and are sent to a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370202">
        remote island to train their powers to perfection in order to defeat the ‘Enemies of Humanity’; but little they know, they are the very force they’re training to fight against.  <br />
<br />
Yes, that’s right, the “heroes” are the “enemies”, and an assassin is sent to the island, by some government officials, to kill them off before they become aware of this fact; but little did the officials know that developing superpowers makes you dumb as fuck and all of the children would probably perish via the process of natural selection. The characters are literally dumber than kindergarteners. It’s like they left their brains at home before coming to this island. <br />
<br />
Nana, the main character and an assassin, is talentless, i.e has no superpowers and has to convince everyone that she has one using her superb deductive skills. She masquerades as a person who can read minds. The premise is interesting, really interesting, but what drags this show down is undeniably the mentally challenged characters. They just don’t care. They don’t give two shits if someone dies, or if someone goes missing. One bullshit explanation from Nana is all it takes for them to channel their inner simp and believe her instantly.<br />
<br />
Think I’m exaggerating? Consider the following scenario. <br />
A transfer student arrives at your high school. She starts hanging around a guy. The next day the guy is absent. And the day after that, and the day after that too. Turns out he’s dead. Also, in the meantime another guy dies and he was also seen hanging around the transfer student. Another one dies, and this time the transfer student is literally caught with the dead body.<br />
Now, using just 1% of your brain, who do you think is the most sus? The transfer student, right? WRONG! She couldn’t do it. Because how could she? She’s so cute and also the class leader. <br />
<br />
I just described the first 5 episodes of the show and except one guy no one even suspects her. The only guy who does suspect her, Kyoya, is my favourite character and my hero. He managed to defeat his inner simp and bonk away his horniness for justice. <br />
<br />
I kid but I really do feel like Kyoya is the only good character in the series. Nana is simply annoying at times and I’m not going to reiterate what I already said about the majority of the cast.<br />
<br />
The mysteries themselves are pretty good. I could see that the author was especially inspired by Detective Conan as the show makes many references to DC. What bothered me most about the series, besides the idiot characters, is the show’s reliance on coincidence. Nana is saved countless times by sheer luck, or should I call it plot?<br />
<br />
She accidentally leaves an incriminating picture of hers in a room, but Kyoya doesn’t find that very picture when he searches that room. Kyoya has been portrayed as a methodical and scrupulous person, but turns out when plot calls characterisation can just jump off a cliff.  <br />
<br />
Michiru, the dumbest bitch to ever exist, literally sees Nana in a picture killing a guy, but does absolutely nothing about it. Some stupid explanation from Nana about “how the picture is not true” is all it takes for her to believe Nana. <br />
<br />
Seriously, when I say the characters believe in Nana, it&#039;s almost similar to how religious people believe in their God. Countless times in the series she’s not able to read minds, and even though it’s her supposed power, and no one bats an eye. She can pull some random stuff out of her ass about how “her power comes and goes” and no one thinks anything of it. Remember, this is a girl who’s been allegedly involved in 4 murders while having no alibi for any of them.<br />
<br />
As I stated above, even though the braindead characters reduce some enjoyability, the actual mystery is really good at times. I especially like the whole arc when Nana kills the necromancer girl and how she would get out the events following that. The whole event was well planned out and didn’t feel forced. I was genuinely intrigued during the resolution of that case. This show could’ve done so much more if it had some better characters and the characters had better judgement.  <br />
<br />
We get some backstory for Nana, and it felt like the author wanted to make her story really tragic, but it backfired as the whole thing is narrated by Nana which felt more like the author’s attempt at fulfilling his obligation towards us instead of creating a compelling case for his character. Same thing goes for the exposition we get about Michiru’s life before she arrived at the island. <br />
<br />
The animation and music are nothing special. The music was tone deaf at times. <br />
<br />
Tl;dr<br />
As I said earlier the concept is really good, but bad execution, dumb cast, weak character work really hurt this show in the worst way possible. <br />

So far, Nana&#039;s actions are totally forced, in fact everything is too forced, the screen turns red to make her look bad, other idiotic characters who don&#039;t even try to understand what&#039;s going on. Seeing Nana&#039;s protagonism doing the dirty work is not difficult, the world is basically revolving around her and it makes her job easier, it&#039;s like playing Among Us with someone who is using Hack. I think I managed to pass on my idea about Munou, but I didn&#039;t do it to discourage anyone, I&#039;m just pointing out facts, whether you will like it or not, it totally depends on your tastes.

    Among us x Death note except instead of being a genius, the mc is slightly smart and only succeeds because everyone else apparently has a rock for a brain. instead of having likeable attributes the mc is in my opinion fully unlikeable and I hate her sooooooo much and instead of really bad major criminals, it&#039;s innocent kids who are discriminated and secretly executed for the wrongdoings of their ancestors. why does everyone praise this show so much, I can&#039;t stand it and if nothing majorly changes that positively surprises me in the next few episodes I will be sure to drop this so far

    Seriously some people compare this anime to death note? This is the worst anime I have watched in a while. The characters are desperate and what highlights the show, naive, naive and more naive and with 2 of iq. This is the only thing that keeps the anime going. Nobody suspects anything, especially of a girl who arrives as a new schoolmate and in which two people later disappear.<br />
<br />
The conversations are ridiculous, they try to sound logical, but everything goes overboard with the twists of the script or the forced feelings they instill in to keep the plot going. <br />
<br />
There is no memorable cast and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363779">
        their personalities are even flatter than boku no hero&#039;s, they just randomly appear to die. There&#039;s not even blood to see here to make up for something. <br />
<br />
Seriously, why think too much about how to kill superheroes if you can just push them off a mountain? Nothing memorable to watch here.

    &quot;Watch Talentless Nana Lise, it&#039;s so great you&#039;ll totally dig it, it&#039;s anime of the season for sure!&quot;<br />
<br />
Every weeb who told me to watch this show owes me 5 dollars for each minute I wasted enduring the episodes. &quot;Munou No Nana&quot; is, while not the *worst* anime this season, it certainly is nowhere near the best. Without getting into too many of the details regarding the story as a whole, I&#039;ll review this quickly. <br />
<br />
Story: The writers are hacks, nobody on the writing team knows what the term &quot;suspense&quot; means or even how to meaningfully build a world up. Talentless Nana is an awful excuse

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363619">
        for a superhero story if you go into this hoping for a &quot;My Hero Academia&quot; rip off that has some of the enjoyment of that series, you won&#039;t find it here. And if you stick around after the fact, you certainly won&#039;t find anything deeper or more fulfilling after the fact. Nana is a show filled with plot holes, shoddy explanations for the world the characters are in, and repetitive writing. Each episode the MC finds themselves in the *exact* same situation they were in last episode just this time &quot;Ohhh boy the stakes are higher, what shall they do to get out of this one I wonder?&quot; If you&#039;re into faux mysteries and shitty plot twists, I guess this is right up your alley then, but I wouldn&#039;t rec this to anyone whose a fan of anime that has a thing for twists and mysteries. Talentless Nana has one job, and it fails miserably at it, which is to be an enjoyable and engaging anime with a neat story. The only thing it really has going for it is episode 1. I was told to go into this blind, and I did, and I can genuinely say episode 1 was the only episode I felt like I was really &quot;into the show&quot; as it were. So all in all, Poor world-building plus shitty plot twists plus terrible mystery equals a very bad story for an anime. <br />
<br />
Art: It&#039;s nothing special, and I can&#039;t say I don&#039;t hate it, but I certainly am not loving it. I think it&#039;s cute, but some of the designs of the characters legitimately just remind me of other more interesting shows I could be watching instead, and yet here I am watching this.<br />
<br />
Sound: I...don&#039;t like the OP. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s neat, and I&#039;m not putting it in my playlist. The same goes for the ED. Both uninspired and not very listenable on their own. Or maybe it&#039;s just me not wanting to actually associate with this show for longer than I have to. It&#039;s generic Jrock if you like it you like it if you don&#039;t you don&#039;t, nothing more to really add to this fact.<br />
<br />
Character: Oh boy, where to start with this one? I&#039;ll tell you right now, the only character I really like is Nanao, that&#039;s about it. Other characters like Kyouya or Nana, however, are just unbearable to watch for me. Especially Kyouya. I just don&#039;t think he makes a good foil for the MC since he always seems to just be conveniently useless for the sake of the plot. Michiru would be cuter if she weren&#039;t dumb as a box of rocks, and not in the fun Nendou kind of way where she&#039;s a dumbass but she&#039;s funny and loves her friends, in the Keichi Maeda way where she just does the stupidest shit for no reason, and we the viewer just have to accept that she&#039;s apart of the main cast and here to stay for possibly the whole season. Nana has one gimmick for her entire character and it&#039;s played literally every 10 seconds she&#039;s on screen, so when she does it one time you&#039;re like &quot;Aw how cool&quot; but after she does it the 30th time in the SAME episode you kind of wish the story wouldn&#039;t focus on her as much. The other students are okay-ish, though some of them seem like really poor rip-offs of other characters from more popular series. Like the angry fire, boy gives me real &quot;Bakugou vibes&quot; with none of the intriguing character or personality. It&#039;s a shame though because we don&#039;t *focus* on any of these other classmates for very long, so we don&#039;t really get to know them as people. And thus, it&#039;s almost like they don&#039;t exist at all aside from background noise and to let the main cast shine more (or shine as bright as they can with their horribly written personalities)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: All in all, I hate this show lol. This is kind of a first for me because I&#039;m not usually one to hate on a show. I give anime as many chances as possible to please me, but this one is just not at all a fun watch. The repetitiveness, the pure idiocy of some of the characters, the blandness of everyone in the background whose &quot;not important&quot;, the glaring plot holes, and the lack of world-building makes for a really shitty watch. <br />
<br />
Overall: Go watch Assassination Classroom or My Hero Academia if you want a fun superhero/ Assassin type show with teenagers. And go watch literally anything else in the &quot;mystery&quot; category if you want a show with actual good plot twists and well-written character dynamics. Don&#039;t waste your time with this one.

    So some people still like this series and I just don&#039;t understand. I&#039;m just hate watching it at this point because I am too far in to just drop it. <br />
<br />
Nana- a basic edgy bitch who really isn&#039;t smart, all her actions are so forced and her plans are very basic. They do the same things every episode with her and It&#039;s all so very predictable and repetitive. <br />
<br />
Other characters, You could replace them with rocks and the story would remain the same. No personality. Bland and boring. A poor excuse for characters.<br />
<br />
Kyouya- He is the only one who is calling Nana out on her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363504">
        bullshit but is always second guessing himself for no other reason that plot armor. <br />
<br />
Art- It&#039;s nothing mind blowing, but it is decent. They try to make Nana look evil by making the screen red whenever she is doing evil planning but if anything it takes away from the seriousness. I would find it creepier if she always just planned her killing with a smile and a normal screen because then it would imply that that killing these students is not such a big deal to her.<br />
<br />
Animation- Mediocre<br />
<br />
Sound- Nothing memorable<br />
<br />
The story is repetitive. &quot;A girl needs to kill the classmates because these kids are evil.&quot; That&#039;s it. That&#039;s the show. People call it a BNHA and Among us love child but I find it an insult to both BNHA and Among us. If anything, it&#039;s like a new inexperienced writer saw death note and BNHA and wanted to make a very bad fanfic with their own OC.

    This is one of those shows that gets you interested for the first few episodes, and gradually you get tired of it because the plot either becomes way too predictable, or the characters act so stupid you can&#039;t bare to watch anymore.<br />
<br />
Spoilers ahead:<br />
<br />
The show focuses on a non-talented assassin that works for the government to infiltrate and eliminate a group of young talented individuals. The problems start right after episode 1 when they introduce the main antagonist/assassin known as Nana, who is faking being a mind reader.<br />
<br />
They make her out to be a &quot;master of deduction&quot; of sorts, where her fake mind reading ability is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review362825">
        really just from her great intuition/meticulous focus on her surroundings. This fake power choice honestly ruins almost the entirety of the show for me. No matter how good they make her out to be at acting like a mind reader, if you can&#039;t legitimately read minds among a group of other people with real abilities, she should be exposed almost immediately. <br />
<br />
<br />
Even though it should be incredibly easy to expose her as a fake, the main rival who is also a detective of sorts, lets her off the hook nearly dozens of times within just the first few episodes where it should have been obvious that she was lying about her powers.<br />
This isn&#039;t anywhere near the level of some great battle of wits like Sherlock Holmes vs Professor Moriarty, or a Yagami Light vs. L, its honestly just embarrassing as you watch this girl get out of trouble over and over again by sheer luck.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll leave my review at this since I don&#039;t want to go into deep spoilers.<br />
<br />
I will just say that if you truly want to enjoy it, try to turn your brain off and not think about the show, because you&#039;ll just hurt your brain trying to rationalize the events that come to pass.

    Never before I have read the manga adaption nor the LN but I&#039;m guessing it has an unwanted ending.<br />
<br />
The story so far is really good, each episode intensifies than the last one.<br />
Rather than focusing on expectation on the character&#039;s outcome after each episode, I find it interesting how each character plays out and it&#039;s something that totally hypes me never knowing what&#039;s gonna happen in between those scenes.<br />
<br />
[A little spoiler]<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
It is exciting to see a &quot;talentless&quot; given the challenge how to expose the abilities of those &quot;talented&#039; using wits before finding a way how to eliminate them one by one at a time.

    Do not judge this from the first half of the first episode!! I am not someone who tells ppl to watch more than 1 episode &quot;until it gets good&quot;, but this is good from the first second, you just haven&#039;t learned the true plot yet and haven&#039;t realized it.<br />
So rare we get the chance to see a anime who makes you think like this one.<br />
<br />
Unlike detective shows in which you cannot see the entire picture and then the MC pulls out some proof that wasn&#039;t even on camera, in this anime you can deduce most things before they are explained by the detective.<br />

    Sadly the anime didn&#039;t conclude at the part i was hoping it would do , but the final episode was quite impactful .<br />
Story 9/10<br />
Without getting too much into spoilers , it starts as a cheap rip off of my hero , then it evolves into this among us narrative with mind games and psychological thriller elements in the mix.Unfortunately it suffers from a huge amount of plot contrivances and even plot contradictions especially at the first couple episodes .I dare say this the anime i watched with the most plot problems ever . A small detail which the studio added that wasn&#039;t present in the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370215">
        manga is that important characters were shown early before their main arc began .<br />
Art and Animation 8/10<br />
They changed the art style used in the manga , which looked off in some of the characters , animation was obviously limited , but the amount of artistic touches from the part of the direction is what carried the show , like the added visuals or when  the color pallets changes in character&#039;s inner monologues.<br />
Sound 8/10<br />
There is mainly 2 or 3 osts that are worth noting , opening was cool but it didn&#039;t stand out that much in comparison to the epic opening we got thus year . The ending song  on the other hand was so touching for me as a manga reader since i understood the symbolism , its definitely ending of the year for me . Also let not forget about the voice actors and especially nana&#039;s , she did very well it exceeded my expectations .<br />
Characters 8/10<br />
And now we reach the most controversial part of the anime , its characters. Nana is a solid protagonist a magnificent bastard type of character similar to light yagami , but contrary to him she got a backstory and a lot of characterization which made a lot of viewers sympathies with her , kyoya is a cool rival/deutaragonist with his mysterious ability and high IQ . But sadly other characters are presented as these stupid naive kids which was disappointing and annoying for a lot of anime/manga readers alike . But this dynamic changes with the introduction of some couple of characters later on .<br />
Enjoyment 9/10<br />
Easily my favorite anime of this year , and a overall a better experience than the manga<br />
Overall 9/10<br />
This show has it fair share of problems , but i found myself invested and hyped with story and its many twists and turns in the  narrative , i highly recommend it <br />
<br />

    Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the Among Us World Finals Championship is: the MC of Munou na Nana!! By using the vents (that the other characters see) and calling numerous emergency meetings, Nana (the MC) wins the victory-defining round because everyone around her has no brain cells!! <br />
<br />
In other words, this is a stranded-on-an-island survival anime with superpowered high schoolers who can’t contact the outside world. We’re supposed to root for the antihero, Nana, who disguises herself as one of these kids. Nana claims to have the power of mind-reading as she takes down some of the most OP characters in some of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370171">
        most WTF ways that border on murder mystery satire.<br />
<br />
*Sigh* Okay I know I’m giving this a 4, but Munou na Nana is actually one of the better anime this season- I know that sounds like complete BS and there’s already been a lot of negative things said about this anime so let’s try to talk positive.<br />
<br />
As you can probably tell, Munou na Nana is not an intelligent anime. Even though it seems to have one of the most thrilling premises on paper, it has some of the lowest lows of the season. Yet somehow, it bounces back from that after the halfway mark. If you are a viewer who can not tolerate stupid characters, this is something that will frustrate you from the get-go and will probably warrant a drop. If you’re also someone who doesn’t tolerate violence that almost leads to rape, you will also probably stop watching at one of these episodes. However, if you’re down for some ironic enjoyment laughing at how dumb everyone is, this might just be for you!!<br />
<br />
Munou na Nana probably wins the award for most improved anime of the season because it has some of the worst directing at the beginning of the season. Not only does Nana use the words “enemies of humanity” 50 times per episode, but the audience is explained over and over about what Nana is trying to do and how she tries to hide it. Additionally, the directors decided to overuse the color red to indicate evilness and the color blue to indicate suspicion. That in itself is not very creative. The worst part is that the number of times they used both colors made me wonder if the LED lights in my computer were broken. It’s really unenjoyable when a thriller anime tries to baby the audience around and repeat things over and over and over…Additionally, a lot of the story writing is divided into parts; each of which is dedicated to how Nana is able to assassinate a person. It’s especially frustrating to see the victims die by either stupidity or unreasonable amounts of trust in a stranger. However, somewhere along the way, there’s actually a noticeable difference in quality. Ironically, when Nana does not actually focus on murdering people, Nana’s character feels more realistic in the anime’s premise and more intriguing to watch. It was a pleasant surprise for me when the writers decided to give Nana character development as she questioned the morality of saving one of her targets. Even though it contradicts her goal completely, I could not help but appreciate the fact that Nana actually felt guilt. Whether that guilt was the fact that she saved a ‘monster’ or that she would have to kill the same person is a mystery. It gives Nana depth as a person when she questions the morality of her actions. <br />
<br />
Now now everyone, let’s take a moment to talk about how Nana takes out kids with Superman/My Hero Academia level powers and is almost always unscathed. 90% of the time, these kids made me wonder if I was this gullible as a high schooler since some of them were so cocky that they didn’t bother warning their classmates. Others just had blind faith in Nana to the point where they didn’t even hide their weaknesses and died a pitiful death. It reminded me a lot of Subaru from Re:Zero since a lot of these characters just kept making the same mistakes over and over again instead of learning from others’ or their own mistakes.<br />
<br />
Well that’s most of what was notable story-wise and directing-wise...what about the main characters?<br />
<br />
Sadly, I must say Nana herself is not a great character overall. Watching closely, you realize Nana is not very intelligent despite being an assassin for the government. Even though she is a ‘mind reader’, she actually makes many mistakes when trying to kill her targets and relies on luck when setting her traps. In other words, she’s sloppy at her job and rolls a lot of dice instead of finding a surefire way of nailing her target. I get that everyone is tired of big brain MCs that just solve everything by themselves, but I prefer that over the way the first few episodes were executed. Even when Nana clearly cannot read people’s minds, she’s almost never called out for it. And in the times where she is called out by Kyouya, the classmate most suspicious of her, nobody believes him. <br />
<br />
Speaking of Kyouya, he’s probably the worst designed two-dimensional character in the series. Despite having ‘confirmed’ Nana is the killer, he keeps gathering evidence, tries to call her out on it, and never takes action. Classic example of ‘all bark, no bite’. It can be argued he’s just there to progress the plot in the background by trying to find ways to communicate with people outside the island these kids are stranded on, but it takes at least 5 dead bodies for him to do so. He always butts heads with Nana to the point where he stalks her since he’s so paranoid she will strike again. Yet Nana still manages to land a kill. There’s a very obvious pattern that the writers used when designing Kyouya’s personality. Kyouya will always claim to have ‘caught Nana’. However, Nana will always manage to come up with something that contradicts Kyouya’s claim to the point where Kyouya is forced to back down. Well I guess that settles everything. Except that Kyouya still suspects Nana regardless. And he does the same thing over and over again. Absolutely useless. It’s no wonder Nana never gets caught.<br />
<br />
In hindsight, it was kind of fun just being annoyed at how small-brain the characters are and seeing what else the writers pulled out of their dorsal end. Unfortunately though, if every anime turned out like this, almost no one would stick around. Bad writing can sometimes be good, especially if done on purpose (which Munou na Nana does not do lmao), but it’s still bad writing. Therefore, don’t expect something like Boku Dake ga Inai Machi or Yakusoku no Neverland. Expect a bunch of small brain OP characters that should be invincible to somehow die by the hands of one obviously evil schoolgirl almost every episode! You can call it plot armor, I can call it deus ex machina, but in the end, it’s an anime that’s so unpredictable that it’s comical how our slightly less small brain antihero lives to see another day. Take what you will out of that; I know I’ll take a rewatch when I’m trying to lose more brain cells!!
