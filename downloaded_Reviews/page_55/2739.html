    It&#039;s hard to make a prequel about one of the most iconic characters in anime and don&#039;t ruin the story, but luckily, that didn&#039;t happen with YBJ.<br />
<br />
An adult medical drama is a breath of frsh air amidst so many highschool harems, ecchi or overpowered characters.<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
<br />
Being a sequel there are some limitations, you must tie this to the original, but as an origin story YBJ is really great. Set in the Vietnam war, in a convulsed Japan, Hazama goes through a lot in order to become the dark character we know. Maybe a 24 episode anime would have been better, but in 12 episodes they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review206040">
        manage to show Hazama&#039;s transformation.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
<br />
It&#039;s easier to draw a magical utopia than a realistic Vietnam era anime, trying to be accurate with technology and clothing, but that doesn&#039;t seem like a problem in YBJ. The series itself has a dark tone, neccesary for the character, but it&#039;s easy to watch.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
<br />
For me, the best opening this season. The BGM helps, it&#039;s nicely chosen and adds a lot to the different settings and places the anime takes. <br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
<br />
Again, making a prequel about an iconic character with a very disctintive personality is hard. You are tied. You can&#039;t discover gunpowder again. There is some character development, that&#039;s the core of everything, and the darkening of Hazama is clear. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
<br />
Not a standard anime, it&#039;s a medical drama, it&#039;s a prequel, it&#039;s something you know how it&#039;s going to end and despite all of the above, you actually want to watch Hazam&#039;s growing. Maybe a bit of a light of hope, maybe because you love the original character, but it&#039;s easy tow atch the anime.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
<br />
It was a great anime. I&#039;d reccomend it for anyone working on the health area, from nurses to morticians. It&#039;s finally an anime you cna connect with, and maybe use it to confront your own ideals about medical ethics.

    Anime is certainly a medium that can portray any type of theme, be it cooking, swimming or even the profession of doctor, which is the case for Young Black Jack. It is an anime that is adapted from one of Tezuka Osamu&#039;s numerous works, including genres such as drama, thriller and psychological ones, which was in some cases well done. Although the concept may seem uninteresting for some viewers, it is surprisingly alluring, yet it is apparent that it has some major flaws, being the inconsistent and episodic story throughout the series the major issue, as these seem to have no real connection with each

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205943">
        other.<br />
<br />
~Story~<br />
<br />
It is the year of 1968, in the middle of the Vietnam war and student protests. The story of Young Black Jack is focused around the young Hazama, portraying his life before working as a clandestine underground doctor in which he will be known as Black Jack. He is a unparalleled genius with a strong sense of being a doctor, meaning he will save everyone even if it goes against the law. This will naturally bring numerous problems as a doctor, yet although these issues are shown to the viewer, the consequences are rather lackluster, albeit hinting at these. Personally I would have liked to see these more pronounced, hence being a bit of a drawback in my opinion.<br />
<br />
There are several interesting aspects the anime portrays such as politics and the display of activism. Several times throughout its duration these are portrayed through student demonstrations or worker strikes, whilst the political issues are shown through the darker side of politics or individuals driven by greed, as opposed to the main protagonists. Another thing to point out is the fact that surgeries and the likes performed were explained aforehand, yet its execution was lackluster and not shown to the viewer. This was a drawback, as it would have been pleasing to see the detail in the surgery, as the details surrounding it were well relaid as well as realistic (albeit delving a bit too much in the theoretical side) to the viewer, knowing that the author himself was once a doctor himself.<br />
<br />
The  main issues with the series lay with the pacing of the series and its inconsistency throughout the series in addition to its episodic nature with no real connection with each other. The first few episodes are interesting to see, as it introduces the main characters and the dark side of the doctor world, meaning the politics and greed behind the scenes. However, the latter episodes were all disjointed, introducing a few characters with a problem, and naturally getting solved in the same episode. Consequently viewers are left with quite tensionless episodes, as well as being clueless as why to the characters were in sudden places, leaving viewers confused whether they missed a portion of the episode. Nonetheless, it must be said that the final episodes where much more intriguing, as it had a good story progression with the introduction of an interesting characters, as well as blending it fantastically with suspense and intrigue.<br />
<br />
~Characters~<br />
<br />
The cast of characters in Young Black Jack is small, focusing mainly on the main protagonists and their hardships throughout the different episodes. There are several character introduced in episodes, yet the majority lose are of no importance in the latter ones. From the ones that were kept, these underwent some character development as well some fleshing out, yet never really outstanding. There is the activist, Hazama&#039;s doctor friend, the supporting girl you name it. What must be mentioned that the behaviour of these were surprisingly human, showcasing greed, egoism, cowardice, insanity and the likes. Hazama himself is certainly the most interesting one, audiences observing his hardships and dilemmas faced when operating on people, in addition to its genius skills. What was sadly a bit lacking was a bit fleshing out of this character, as the very short flashbacks to his past left the viewers intrigued in it.<br />
<br />
~Animation and sound~<br />
<br />
The animation quality of  Young Black Jack is well done, yet not outstanding; several inconsistencies in the character&#039;s could be found throughout the series, such as small changes in character&#039;s facial structure, or distant detail of these. The characters design is varied and very distinguishable from each other, yet there were some that were too ridiculous for the series, meaning too cartoonish. Although certainly a welcoming change, it is not befitting of the series: it makes it difficult to take the anime seriously, which is a shame, as it manages to create a serious and dark atmosphere. Other issue I might want to point out is the fact that the surgeries done are merely shown with some imaginary strings moving in air without displaying the actual surgery itself. While it certainly adds to the awe of the protagonists, it is rather lackluster when trying have some insight in its works.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack used in the anime matches at times with different scenarios, yet for others it felt either lacking or not befitting of the atmosphere; these were ultimately forgettable. The voice actors matched well with the different personalities, displaying correctly different emotions when the situation required it.<br />
<br />
~Enjoyment~<br />
<br />
Young Black Jack was overall an enjoyable anime, yet its heights and lows were definitely the major drawback of the series, in addition to the connectionless episodes throughout the majority of the series. The ideas implemented were certainly of interest, with some interesting characters and certainly some interesting display of the world of the doctors. However, when finally finishing the series I was wondering why it didn&#039;t take the way the final episodes were done: it would have been so much more interesting as a series. So do I recommend this anime? I do, yet only to a certain an extent, as it was throughout the majority of the story too episodic for my likes.<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading.

    A medical drama like Young Black Jack isn’t something we see often these days. Having a very small of series related to the medical field, the show is essentially a rare breed. As such, Young Black Jack is something that you won’t find these days easily. Branded as a prequel, it isn’t entirely necessary to watch the sequel. In fact, I came into this series as a newbie with little experience about the character or its story. What I got in the end though is more than what was expected.<br />
<br />
Based on the manga of the same name, the series takes place in 1968 where the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205875">
        story also focuses on Hazama, a medical student with some unique and fascinating skills. It’s interesting to note that the show also focuses a bit on the war and political struggles as the time setting takes place roughly around the Vietnam War. If you’re a fan of historical fiction, then the show might also be a bit of extra treat for you. <br />
<br />
Hazama is the central character. His medical and surgical skills are invaluable as we see his capability of saving lives. The tasks he undertakes defines his skills especially during crude operations. It’s also intriguing to see a fusion of metaphoric imagery through imaginative and realism during these medical procedures. What the show succeeds about Hazama’s character is his brilliant mind. Every episode, he gets into some complicated affair where his medical skills plays some important role. The show also establishes Hazama’s personality as a mysterious individual. His actions aren’t usually heroic either as he doesn’t use his skills out of the kindness of his heart. In fact, he charges a fee (and a heavy one) for his skills. So in a way, Hazama is more of a mercenary hired to sell his abilities. Despite this, there are times when he risks his life to save others; most noticeably during his time at the heart of the Vietnam War. <br />
<br />
Young Black Jack’s character cast consists of a wide variety from diverse fields of expertise. While most of the main supporting characters have some medical expertise, some others play important roles that determines the fate of life and death. Two easily recognizable characters are Maiko and Yabu as they get involved with Hazama’s medical adventures that takes them to places of unimaginable danger. Such an example is Vietnam, where the war conflict becomes heated in the rough terrains of the jungle. We see what Hazama and his crew has to endure as they get involved with local militia forces. The reality of war can easily be recognizable with the death of soldiers and crude injuries. Luckily, there’s Hazama and this is where his abilities can really make a different between life and death. He isn’t the only one as we later meet another skilled medical expert who directly competes against him. Later on, we’ll also witness the darker side of the medical world after a freak accident leads to a chain of conflicting events. But on most parts, the story explores Hazama’s experience as a medical student. It’s a medical drama about this mysterious guy who does mysterious deeds.<br />
<br />
One really interesting concept that is explored in the show is the political and activist affairs. We got workers going on strikes or demanding a better wage for their work. There’s also a strong anti-war flair among the drama especially in Japan. What this brings into the series is a look at the historical drama that is surprisingly realistic. Activities such as student protests and worker strikes portrayed in anime brings realism into the story with their roles. Furthermore, the show approaches itself with antagonists that are mostly driven by corruption or self-greed. Characters with wealth and others who think they can get away with anything because of their social status are branded as an anti-thesis of the main characters. On the other hand, there’s also the soldiers and guerrilla units who plays more of the stereotypical bad guys. If we look at the Vietnam War, there’s also the Viet Cong who physically and mentally torture Hazama’s group. It’s a pretty damn cruel world out there.<br />
<br />
The overall adaptation of the artwork is suitable for a series taking place in the 1960s. It capture a modernized setting where technology is less sufficient compared to our today’s world but also functional, or at least enough for a medical student like Hazama to perform his operations. I also like how the show adapts supernatural-like imagery with Hazama’s medical skills. Although it seems gimmicky at first, it’s also quite artistic and makes us realize what is he is capable of. Speaking of which, Hazama’s character design is very noticeable with his well-toned body and facial features. Out of any character in the show, he is the most recognizable with his bishounen design and body that seems to have underwent through experimentation. Others are less impressive although there are a few that stands out from time to time. And finally, be aware of man service that is very noticeable, perhaps even far-fetched. The fan service comes from Hazama himself and you’ll have to see it to believe it.<br />
<br />
A lesser noticeable feature about the show is the soundtrack. For starters, it feels very much the same almost each episode that occasionally shifts between melancholic and thrilling. What I do find slightly impressive is the eerie OST they use for scenarios involving medical operations. It can send a thrill down your spine as viewers will have to anticipate if an operation will be a success or failure. Otherwise, the soundtrack is mostly mediocre besides the manly choreography of the OP song. The character voices aren’t so impressive either.<br />
<br />
By the end of the day, it’s not hard to see that Young Black Jack isn’t a show for everyone. It’s certainly a rare breed to see such a medical drama as it’s refreshing and explores themes that we don’t see too often in anime these days. It also invites attention to anyone who wants to see how the medical field is like. The idea of transplanting organs and operating on half-dead victims is an engrossing concept that can be fascinating. And thankfully, Young Black Jack gives a bit of such concept each episode. There’s not much comedy overall as in the end, the show is about so much more than just being a medical student. It’s about Hazama’s life as young Black Jack, a name that would later become infamous in the medical world.<br />

    This review is written by a Black Jack fan. <br />
<br />
Young Black Jack is the 4th anime series starring Black Jack, however its quality does differ significantly from the other related anime. Despite the obvious differences in tone and writing the series might serve as a gateway to the much better Black Jack stories and related material.<br />
<br />
This anime serves as a “possible” prequel story detailing the events of Black Jack’s origin and career as an underground doctor. The anime is set in Black Jack’s younger days where he went by his real name, Hazama Kuro, and is still in medical school. Upon doing some research, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205949">
        Young Black Jack anime is based on a manga which doesn’t follow a structure as seen in Osamu Tezuka’s original Black Jack manga. Young Black Jack in its initial visuals seems to cater to a sexualized or a fan service depiction of Black Jack especially when the opening displays him shirtless and in chains. Another change are the character designs as they are not “cartoony” as that’s how Tezuka would typically draw but instead the art style carries a more feminine/shojo flair mostly through their eyes and lips. The characters are almost drawn with realistic proportions with the exception of Mr. Mustachio &amp; few others who resemble Tezuka’s art. <br />
<br />
Regardless of the imagery, the anime isn’t about sexualized eye candy (as I feared) but focuses mostly on medical drama as it should. This is where it gets compared to the other Black Jack series as the content in Young Black Jack varies from dull to great. I personally found most episodes to be lacking the same impact as seen in Black Jack OVA or Black Jack TV and much of the problem is Black Jack himself. Hazama Kuro isn’t Black Jack yet which is why his character should be portrayed differently. While it is natural for a character to behave differently I could not see an eventual Black Jack grow from this interpretation of Hazama Kuro. Hazama’s reactions to people suffering aren’t appropriate in some episodes specifically the Vietnam story (episodes 4-6).  I noticed that Hazama’s emotions really vary per episode as in some he seems almost emotionless while in others episodes he’s clearly enraged and devastated. Most of the time he behaves cool and focused but I don’t think those professional traits should be present yet. In some scenes Hazama is presented as a tortured individual by being surrounded by thorns giving a really obvious messiah symbolism which comes off as more forced than sacred. While “Black Jack The Movie” does nickname Black Jack as the surgeon with the hands of god, Hazama isn’t at a level where he should be described as the next savior as he’s still inexperienced. For an origin story it would make more sense if Hazama made mistakes and learned from them, thus gaining knowledge as he matures into Black Jack. Episode 2&amp;3 are perfect examples of Hazama being doubtful of his decisions which are suitable for this type of prequel anime. <br />
<br />
The real fruit of this rendition of Young Black Jack is the inclusion of two characters from other Tezuka series being Hyakkimaru from “Dororo” &amp; Sapphire from “Princess Knight”.  These characters possess different names in this continuity but they’re basically the same character especially with Hyakkimaru. Episodes 9-11 focus heavily on Hyakkimaru to the point where it felt like a modern reboot of the yokai manga he’s based on. In short, these episodes are easily some of the best in both writing and gruesome visuals as it plays a heavy toll in shaping Hazama’s character into Black Jack. Furthermore, the final episode guest starring Sapphire also affects Hazama’s mentality leaving for a very powerful ending to this Black Jack prequel.<br />
<br />
In summary, I think episodes 4-8 are very lackluster but that’s only because I can’t help but think of better Black Jack stories that covered similar topics and executed with more shocking drama. So I’ll end this review with some recommendations related to the Black Jack series which are the bare essentials. Young Black Jack isn’t a terrible anime by any means but it is a weaker installment in the whole Black jack franchise. The tone can be dark and emotional at times but it only shows that there are some characters whom aren’t well suited to be marketed in made-up prequels as it limits the true appeal of their peak in adulthood.<br />
<br />
Recommendations:<br />
Dororo &amp; Hyakkimaru 1969 (26 eps) <br />
 This black &amp; white anime serves as a better introduction to the Hyakkimaru character. You could also read the manga which is 3 volumes.<br />
<br />
Black Jack OVA 1993 (12 eps) <br />
Black Jack’s first anime debut; taken in a seinen approach. English dub is recommended.<br />
<br />
Black Jack TV 2004 (76 eps)<br />
Episodes are based on the original manga.<br />
<br />
Black Jack 21 2006 (17 eps)<br />
Episodes are heavily plot related detailing Black Jack’s family; very similar to Naoki Urasawa’s Monster.<br />
<br />
Black Jack Two Doctors of Darkness 2005 (Movie)<br />
A movie centered on Black Jack &amp; Dr. Kiriko<br />
<br />
The Black Jack manga is also recommended. <br />
<br />
Super Doctor K Manga<br />
Has nothing to do with Black Jack but carries a similar type of story structure just with more masculinity. <br />

    I&#039;m still a very new fan of Black Jack; I got hooked on the series after reading the first chapter of the manga in the college library during a lunch break. The reason I was hooked? Several reasons, the main one being how bizarre, but interesting the first scenario Black Jack finds himself in: Being coerced to save the life of a rich, but corrupt man’s son, at the cost of taking the life of an innocent bystander.<br />
<br />
The theme repeats itself throughout the whole of Black Jack, we’re given characters that have a back story: You can relate to them and sympathise with them, despite

          <span style="display: none;" id="review207000">
        the fact they won’t ever be recurring in the series again. This is one of the most crucial elements that makes Black Jack such a good, interesting franchise. However, Young Black Jack fails to deliver not only in this department, but nearly everywhere else as well.<br />
And this is where we come to the main problem with Young Black Jack: It’s underdeveloped. It feels like just a husk of Black Jack, it wants to be Black Jack, but doesn&#039;t really understand what it is that makes Black Jack what it is.<br />
<br />
Starting from the first episode, just about everything feels wrong. The patient that Jack must operate on in this episode is given no back story what so ever, he’s literally just rolled in on a gurney, and Jack (being only a medical student in this series) declares that he can save the boy’s life, but of course, he will charge, what later becomes, his infamous fee if the operation is successful. We’re then shown some fancy handiwork from Jack, and then, hey presto! The boy is saved and everyone breathes a sigh of relief. The end.<br />
<br />
There’s just no love in it, watching Jack operate is like watching a boring medical drama that follows all the formulas and doesn&#039;t try anything different of its own that makes it stand out. How are we supposed to care about a patient when we don’t even know who he or she is? The kid in question literally didn&#039;t even get any lines, because he was already unconscious when he’s presented to us. The same pattern repeats throughout every episode so far, none Jack’s patients are given any kind of subsistence, they just exist for him to operate on, and that’s it. Characters just feel stale and robotic, with not much life breathed into them.<br />
This brings me to another issue, Jack himself. He feels boring, with little personality or any of the charm the original character has. Sure, he’s meant to be a young version of Jack, a 22 year old medical student who’d never performed an operation before (but of course his first one was a success). He’s uncertain in his abilities, and is still learning and developing, but that’s kind of the problem, there isn&#039;t really much character development.<br />
<br />
The series fails time and time again to have any kind of significant character development for Jack. The 3rd episode was one of the best ones, where Jack questions his reasons for wanting to become a doctor, and where he stands on morality.<br />
The last main issue with Young Black Jack is the pacing of each episode. They drag, and drag and drag and drag. The 2nd episode literally takes place entirely in the same room for the first half, and then the majority of the second half remains that way. There’s just far too much talking and not enough of anything else going on. One of the many things that made the original Black Jack great was the story-telling, and how each story seems to flow at just the perfect pace. It always takes up as much time as was needed, with every iota of focus being on developing the story of each chapter.<br />
<br />
In a slightly later episode, an iconic &quot;villainous&quot; character is introduced (I&#039;ll leave his name disclosed in case of spoilers). He only sticks around for two episodes however, and we&#039;re not really given any insight or back story into his character, which you may have expected and most likely wanted from a classic Black Jack character.<br />
<br />
Even when I started viewing the series as being more of a standalone one, separate of the original Black Jack franchise, it still remained a un-engaging, uninteresting, and quite frankly, boring series. I&#039;ve seen worse, and it isn&#039;t completely without its redeemable qualities. The series does succeed in being pretty emotional at times, albeit it rarely, and I&#039;ve seen far better executions of emotional scenes.<br />
<br />
All in all, this is a very disappointing series. Everything that made Black Jack good in the first place feels like it’s been ripped from the bones of this new adaptation, and we’re left with just some skeleton that doesn&#039;t know what it’s doing, or what it wants to be.<br />
If you’re familiar with Black Jack prior to watching this, there isn&#039;t really much to see here. If you were hoping for a solid back story to Jack, I&#039;m afraid you’re most likely going to be let down. If you&#039;ve never watched any of the older adaptations, or read the manga, I suggest you start there first rather than here, because this series is likely to give you a wrong impression of just what Black Jack is. Read just the first couple of chapters from the first volume, and you’ll know what to expect from this series that sadly, isn&#039;t presented here.<br />
<br />
Black Jack is a great franchise in and of itself, and this series doesn&#039;t do it the justice it deserves. Many of the stories in the original Black Jack stayed with you long after reading/watching. There&#039;s nothing much to ponder on the episodes of Young Black Jack after watching however, the stories are bland, throw-away tales that you&#039;re likely have a hard time remembering years (or even just a few months) down the line.

    - it is rare to nowadays to see an anime related to medical aspect .. <br />
not school life , shoujo , romance or shounen .. just something more mature &amp; realistic .. <br />
<br />
- medical career , is not an easy job to do , not daily routine you do without awareness .. there are always pressures , life of people in your hands .. complicated situation require extreme proceedings even if it was illegal but you have another choice but to save someone&#039;s life .. &amp; on the contrary .. there are doctors who are even way further from calling them &quot; humans &quot; ..

          <span style="display: none;" id="review207663">
        that&#039;s briefly what anime discussed .. <br />
<br />
- for Art .. <br />
i always prefer that style of drawing .. similar to nineties anime .. despite you can feel male character kind so similar &amp; alike .. &amp; always fit with such type of anime which requires some bold &amp; sharp lines not like the art of shoujo or school anime that&#039;s tends to be smooth , big eyes , bright colors &amp; this staff .. <br />
<br />
- for sound .. <br />
i loved opening &amp; ending theme .. <br />
but , some some sound tracks couldn&#039;t match with atmosphere .. <br />

    The telling of Black Jack before he&#039;s the figure we know him as today. And the rare medical anime that you don&#039;t see all too often. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m a pretty big fan of Tezuka Osamu&#039;s original Black Jack series, so I was pretty happy to find out this spin-off series even existed (Sadly the manga isn&#039;t translated, but it exists). The storyline follows the same layout as Black Jack, a bunch of short stories where Hazama Kuroo does his little medical magic for one reason or another and there is conflict. It&#039;s much darker and in depth than the original Black Jack since it took place

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205887">
        in such a controversial time period, introducing a bunch of historical points in Japan and the world&#039;s history, like the Vietnam War and the Civil Right&#039;s movement of America (dang, even as a medical student, Black Jack just can&#039;t seem to sit still). This series is a bit more realistic in the medical sense since this is written in the 2010s while Black Jack is ancient, so it&#039;s nice to see that the environment is actually sterile this time around. It&#039;s also nice to see how they incorporated Hyakkimaru, another work by Tezuka Osamu) into the series to draw parallels.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t really have a problem with it, but apparently the art style was a big deal to some Black Jack/ Osamu fans. The anime sports a more bishounen yaoi-esque look with Hazama being this really fit handsome young man. I mean, Black Jack is meant to be really handsome save for that big patchwork on his face, so I really didn&#039;t have a problem with it. Rather I actually liked it better than Osamu&#039;s round and comedy-like artwork. I think the art style for Young Black Jack fit the mood better and made it a tad bit more series where it needed to be (no hate please. I like Osamu&#039;s art too). <br />
<br />
It&#039;s a tad bit overdramatic in places here and there, but it&#039;s nice to see how the prodigal student of Honma Joutarou fell into the darkness of becoming Black Jack. It really goes to show that sometimes the world is so screwed up that the people who care most are forced to enter the darkness because of their kindness. And with Black Jack&#039;s skill, you just work magic all day everyday.

    [This review contains minor spoilers.]<br />
I am glad that I watched this.<br />
I probably wouldn&#039;t recommend this to others.<br />
I have watched this once, subtitled. I have only watched the anime. I have only watched this season.<br />
I won&#039;t watch this again.<br />
<br />
---- Positives ----<br />
<br />
The series starts off well.<br />
The first few episodes are fast-paced and interesting with a lot of information being thrown at the viewer. I was propelled through watching the series entirely off of the energy from the first few episodes, even though the later episodes dragged.<br />
<br />
Hazama has a way of pleasantly resolving issues.<br />
Especially in the earlier episodes, Hazama works miracles and find clever ways of dealing with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review238775">
        surgical problems. With his perfect success rate, it&#039;s entertaining to see how he deals with the issues he faces - there&#039;s still tension even though you know things are going to work out in the end.<br />
<br />
Hazama is a male protagonist with backbone.<br />
He boldly takes action even when not in the operating room. He&#039;ll speak his mind to other characters even when it&#039;s something they don&#039;t want to hear. He almost has too much backbone in some cases, like when he shoves Okamoto out of the way because she&#039;s not performing first aid on a patient quickly enough.<br />
<br />
---- Negatives ----<br />
<br />
Hazama almost seems proud that he doesn&#039;t have a license.<br />
Throughout the series, the fact that Hazama is still just an unlicensed student comes up multiple times. At first, I saw it neutrally - &quot;okay, he doesn&#039;t have a license, he&#039;s working on acquiring one, and he&#039;s just doing surgeries under special circumstances&quot;. However, after this became a refrain of the series, I stopped understanding why we find out so little about his progress to obtain his license, and what the requirements even are. Eventually, it seemed like the author was using the &quot;genius without credentials&quot; subject, painting the romanticized picture of someone who is so smart that they, for some reason, shun standard procedures. This plot aspect only works in certain cases - and it doesn&#039;t work too well here.<br />
Opportunity for cancel: Probably, partially. I haven&#039;t seen the main series, Black Jack, so this aspect of the story was probably a necessity given that this is a prequel. However, the series would have done better to spend just a few minutes explaining what he has to do to obtain his license and when he can expect to obtain it.<br />
<br />
The surgeries are entertaining, but overly fancy.<br />
When the surgeons play around with their scalpels and other tools, it makes for entertaining anime scenes, but to some point, I sure wouldn&#039;t want to be on the operating table with these circus acts going on.<br />
Opportunity for cancel: Yeah, sure. Without any of the fancy movements, the surgeries would probably be boring to watch.<br />
<br />
Later episodes drag.<br />
While the first few episodes were really interesting and fact-paced, later episodes took longer to get to the point, in comparison. There was also a diminished focus on surgeries and more of a focus on the politics of the medical profession and on war and protests.<br />
Opportunity for cancel: Probably. I haven&#039;t seen the main series, Black Jack, so the last few episodes of Young Black Jack probably provide a smooth transition to the main series, where I would expect similar themes regarding the darkness of the medical field that exists in-series.

    A prequel to the beloved series, Black Jack, this show was, in all honesty, trying to fit into the Black Jack universe. Let me explain why.<br />
<br />
We all know who Hazama Kuroo is. He&#039;s a medical genius who can operate on anyone with 1000% success rate. But how did he become such? Well, you won&#039;t find it in this prequel because he&#039;s just a medical student in this series. But what I do like about the young Hazama is his dark background. Having performed surgeries in dangerous environments while still a student is quite a dilemma. It makes me look at him at a different perspective.<br />

        got my attention the most was the historical accuracy of the series. It presented real events like the Vietnam war, city riots etc. Heck, even the setting captured the real locations. It&#039;s not everyday you get to see an anime set in Vietnam. <br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t finish the original black jack series, but I do know that the plot devices used in the series were similar.<br />
<br />
But this show was far from perfect. Despite being a prequel, we&#039;re not really introduced to other important elements found in the original. Sure, we were introduced to familiar characters, but that&#039;s about it. But again, I didn&#039;t finish the original series, so I&#039;m not really sure it captured the whole thing or not.<br />
<br />
I would recommend this if you&#039;re into medical slice of life series,and I guess it&#039;s fine if you haven&#039;t watched the original. Because before there was Black Jack,there was Kuroo Hazama.

    at the beginning it was classical anime  it has some good points but the development of story didn&#039;t change at all <br />
<br />
most of my family are doctors (exp me i am engineer XD) so i know some basic about that job so after each ep the realistic of the anime decrease something like &quot; he did it by himself with out any help at first time &quot; is something that impossible  <br />
<br />
at the natural station maybe i will give him 5/10  but that wasn&#039;t the case in here because the anime just take some politics issues and present it by very bad

          <span style="display: none;" id="review347442">
        way <br />
<br />
yup i mean Vietnam war the anime used the same concept as the USA media just tell the people how good they are <br />
<br />
just in the anime : War crimes are done only by Vietnam side , USA was just there for spread flower nothing else , USA used air force most of time to destroy everything include the target and anything who just around them  and more   <br />
here is some facts u can find it by 2 min search :<br />
&quot;A large number of war crimes took place during the Vietnam War. War crimes were committed by both sides during the conflict and included rape, massacres of civilians, bombings of civilian targets, terrorism, the widespread use of torture, and the murder of prisoners of war. Additional common crimes included theft, arson, and the destruction of property not warranted by military necessity.&quot;<br />
<br />
i am not here to say who is right or wrong but don&#039;t stuck  politics issues if u want to just lie about it and didn&#039;t show the whole picture <br />
someone will say &quot;man that isn&#039;t political program to do that &quot; well u r right that was just anime so don&#039;t talk about political , if u want to do that just convert it to political program that no one will watch it

    I was shaken a little bit by the art style, and almost didn&#039;t watch the show because of it, but I&#039;m glad I did. Seeing Kuro Hazama&#039;s life as a medical student before he became the infamous &quot;Black Jack&quot; was definitely something I&#039;ve been wanting to see when I first watch the OVAs. It was interesting, and there was a lot of unnecessary fanservice - not that I&#039;m complaining. My only problem with YBJ is the fact that the anime seemed a little rushed. There was only twelve episodes that captured Kuro&#039;s life as a medical student. I really wish that there was more depth within

          <span style="display: none;" id="review240462">
        this anime and more episodes that showed some serious struggles with his studies. There were times when he was hesitant to perform a surgery because it was illegal, but other than that, there was hardly any conflict. Other than that, I was happy to see young Kuro&#039;s life before he became the doctor we all know and love. He was adorable and the comedy in the show - while there wasn&#039;t that much - was quite hilarious!

    I thought this anime was similar, yet different to the anme called &quot;monster&quot;. In a way it was like both looking and experiencing through the life of Kenzo Tenma&quot;. Because both main characters are both doctor&#039;s and dedicated, if not &quot;obsessed&quot; with saving patients whether they are on the side of justice or evil, whether they are right or wrong, both try to follow the oath. Also, one who has a what you one would call a &quot;license&quot; while the other saves people&#039;s life without a license. But, both seem to really care about their patients, as well as becoming the best they can be
