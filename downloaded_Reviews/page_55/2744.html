    It usually takes me 1-2 days to finish a 24 episode anime. It took me 1 week to finish this anime. Ima give my opinion on what I thought of this anime.<br />
<br />
I always like to begin with art first for my reviews since that is usually what I judge it on when I watch a series.<br />
<br />
Art: It was GREAT until..........episode 10 and up. I don&#039;t know if it was just me or what, but the &quot;basquash&quot; and the ball bouncing got much slower and boring, the graphics got worse as it went on, and there were inconsistency in the drawings. I don&#039;t know if they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19592">
        got lazy or fed up with this anime and just threw a crap job at the end, but the art was painfully bad.  It was painfully slow, their movements, and there were less ball bouncing. The character art was ok, but it got worse later on. The art was what caught my attention in the beginning with the mecha and the choreography of the mecha, but it got into such a slow paced choreography that it made no difference than watching the first BFB match that was played. All they did towards the end was add some shiny trails, and apparently was supposed to make the matches more exciting, but it wasn&#039;t really. (The fatty was still fat, and then all of a sudden skinny.........I laughed).<br />
<br />
Sound: It was GREAT until................episode 15 or below, I forgot. The opening and ending was very catchy. I listened to both the opening and ending everytime I watched the anime. The background songs in the anime was also excellent, especially during some of the matches. It made my heart tingle and made me want more. Then it got worse...the sound, like the art, was getting pretty bad. I guess the 2nd opening was good, but the 2nd ending was only mediocre. The background music played later was horrible and at most times, very random. The timing was bad, and it doesn&#039;t seem as interesting. They even didn&#039;t bother to change the voice actor of Slasher when he turned young.<br />
<br />
Character: Dan JD, lawlz. I laugh at him. I didn&#039;t like him in the beginning, and I still didn&#039;t like him til the very end. All the characters are very shallow, and there are no interesting characters (except for Iceman, gotta love him). They&#039;re art was the only good thing. I mean, if they just kept the &quot;dunk mask&quot; on Dan instead of the overly retarded looking blue helmet, I might of liked him a little bit more than I do now. The character relations are horrible too. We see &quot;romance&quot; (LOL) develop at the most random times. Also, I really didn&#039;t like Miyuki and Alan. They were pretty useless in this whole mess. The appearance of Navi was at most random. He didn&#039;t contribute much at all to the whole anime. If they wanted Sela to like someone, make her like Iceman Hotty.<br />
<br />
Story: Lol. I actually would of preferred if this was just a regular sports anime where a boy just wants to go to the moon to heal his sister&#039;s legs so she can walk again and play basketball. The whole, Nike saving the world and earth and moon crashing and destroying the moon and playing basketball when the earth is being destroyed is as bit excessive. There were many cliche moments. I laughed at the RougexDan kiss scene. The storyline started going all over the place. I don&#039;t know how to explain this anime. I can&#039;t even write a review on this without being frustrated. There&#039;s so many things to talk about without spoiling a whole bunch of stuff. It was just bad, and I didn&#039;t like it. The relationship between Dan and Coco SHOULD have been the main focus of the storyline, but then they shifted to Dan and made him the legend. Starting at like episode 15, they kept saying legend, legend. It was repetitive and not to mention that I have no freaking idea what they were talking about. When I first heard it, I thought, was he gonna play basketball to save the world? I was right, unfortunately. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment factor: I liked it until episode 9. Everything went downhill til then. The forced storylines and the forced relationships and the forced dialogues and actions all made this anime very unbearable to watch. When I first watched this, I was like, oh yea, this anime is getting a 8. But no, it&#039;s not. Alan was just annoying and a waste of screentime. They made us see her practice basketball, and she gets to use it maybe once in this whole anime. Her &quot;hearings&quot; are also annoying. Then towards the end. We see characters teleporting to different places. One second they&#039;re at the camp, the other they&#039;re at the gate. The fatty turns skinny, then fat again, then skinny in like 15 minutes of the anime. The ending didn&#039;t answer MANY QUESTIONS. I had a lot. WHY DID THEY NOT MAKE COCO AND DAN TALK TO EACH OTHER OR HAVE A MEETING. Instead, they showed Iceman and Dan playing basketball. Gotta be kidding me. And not to mention who Dan ends up with is unclear (although most people say it&#039;s Rouge). <br />
<br />
TL;DR - THE FIRST 9 EPISODES WERE EXCELLENT. THE REST WERE HORRIBAD.

    This is my first review, and as much as I will try to stay biased for the reader, I can only write with the mood I am feeling at the time I was watching the episodes.<br />
<br />
Basquash: <br />
Well what can I say? What started as a brilliant roller-coaster formula to an inventive sports recipe of basketball, ended up collapsing midway and failing to meet the viewers expectation to what could have been a great shonén series.<br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
I&#039;ve given the story side of Basquash a 5 due to that, there is none. It&#039;s your typical shonén anime with sports and mecha(called Big Foots) combined to give you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review17664">
        an unorthodox game of what&#039;s called Big Foot Basketball(BFB for short). Like all sports anime, there is a hint of romance but not enough for a follow through, and like every mecha, there&#039;s upgrades although in this show the upgrades are just the shoes(which NIKE have blatantly smeared all over the series as they pretend to sponsor the team). <br />
<br />
Well I&#039;d be lying to say there is no story as there is one, but due to the lack of pacing and the inconsistencies the series provides, it can easily confuse the viewer to what they&#039;re really watching....and Dan&#039;s character is no help either.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
The art in itself is spectacular, if not at times, over the top. From the anime studio(Satelight) who gave us Macross Frontier, Heat Guy J, Noein and Guin Saga, be expected to be breath taken by the variety of the background colors to the combination of CG. There has not been a moment I have been disappointed and although the character designs aren&#039;t very realistic, you learn to grow with it as you may have if you&#039;ve seen anime like TTGL or Soul Eater. <br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
This is the part I may start to be a little biased, but all with good reason. The OST of Basquash is amazing!  From the OP to the ED, to the BGM in between, the music of Basquash is what sets it apart from all the mecha/sports genre out there. Since the release of Eclipse&#039;s(who happened to be idols in the series) album, my partner has not failed to play their song once a day on her ipod! Whether it be an opening for the main character(with &#039;No Limit&#039; by Eclipse) or a tear jerking scene of 2 would be lovers saying their goodbyes(&#039;Running On&#039; also by Eclipse), each and every song, will draw and captivate the crowd!<br />
<br />
For the most part, I&#039;m guessing this department is what really draws a crowd in as Basquash is like one long drawn out AMV for me.<br />
<br />
Characters: 5/10<br />
The reason why I&#039;ve given its characters a 5 is due to its lack of. You are first introduced to a motley crew of kids lead by Dan(main character a.k.a Dunk Mask). Now at first episode I had liked Dan for being wild and out of control, and his actions is what lead me to ask for more(specially at the end). Pretty much like Kamina of TTGL or Black Starr of Soul Eater, all brawn and no brain. But as the show carries on, you start to at times, loathe his ignorance and stupidity. The supporting cast, is Dan&#039;s saving grace. You have Dan&#039;s sister who gives us the back story, Dan&#039;s team mates Sela and Iceman(who are a mix of cool and sexy), Dan&#039;s childhood friends(Bel &amp; Ganz) and childhood sweetheart(Miyuki), and Dan&#039;s manager Haruka Gracia(who is the also the main fan-service with her Lunar Busts). Add in idols Eclipse and you pretty much get a cast that&#039;s watchable. Oh, and I almost forgot Spanky, who is Dan&#039;s sidekick and mascot. A little pet(if you could call it that), who talks crudely and provides the humor for the show.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
Basqash&#039;s saving grace is its chemistry. As I had mentioned earlier, Basquash is a roller-coaster of an anime with its ups and down, but due to the chemistry of its music, art and characters, it does make you want to keep your eyes glued for the next episode.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6/10<br />
Overall I have given this show a 6 out of 10 for its inventiveness. If your looking to watch an anime where you need to use your head like a  mystery series, then this is not for you, but if your looking for something fresh with good music and eye-candy, I can guarantee Basquash will deliver.

    The idea of the whole anime may sound ridiculous, but it is exactly the fact that they managed to recreate it in an interesting way that makes the series really intriguing. How many people would watch this after a describtion such as this one: &quot;Guys playing basketball in giant robots; sometimes in THE SPACE.&quot; I doubt there would be many anticipating to watch something like that. But what never ceased to amaze me throughout the whole series was that I didn&#039;t even once feel like I was watching something dumb and not well-thought. An idea that seems stupid, stereotypical and clichè may actually surprise you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review108917">
        by representing an overall satisfying story. <br />
<br />
The whole plot was in general really nicely planned, I noticed they managed to squeeze in something like a mini-culmination in every single episode. There was no episode with just talk and no action and vice versa. So these two things were somewhat in balance all the time.  On a sad note, I was left unsatisfied by the way things concluded. Towards the end the anime became too messed up with all sorts of fanatsy elements. A little bit too much, in my opinion, considering that the main thing in this anime is basketball. <br />
<br />
The art was good in its own way. I suppose it would be simply out of place if it was too beautiful and graceful. I am content with the looks of the characters, despite the fact that from time to time I found them drawn too childish. <br />
<br />
The sound effects, the acting skills of the voice actors and the songs were absolutely and undoubtetly perfectly selected for this anime. I have absolutely nothing negative to say. <br />
<br />
The characters were fun, colourful and nicely developed. Some of them were however simply not deep enough. Too superficial and stereotypical at times, but just a few of them and only rarely. I also liked the fact that there were plenty of female characters, unlike in other sports and action anime. I didn&#039;t feel any lack of female presence, which somehow gave a certain sense of colourfulness and completion to the whole story. <br />
<br />
The enjoyment I got from watching this anime, unlike most people would predict from its describtion, was great. I had mostly fun and laughed like crazy at some ridiculous scenes. I liked the way basketball matches were recreated and it was a real joy to observe such a fine animation. <br />
<br />
Overall, this anime is worth watching, regardless of  if you are into basketball or sports as a whole or not. I had a great time watching it, but I do not think I shall ever re-watch it. It is exciting and makes you wait with anticipation for the next episode, but missing the element of surprise, it&#039;s just not the same. <br />
Whoever hasn&#039;t watched this anime yet, I recommend it from the bottom of my heart.

    *This Review Contains Spoilers*<br />
<br />
So, I&#039;m re-writing this review because I&#039;ve finished the series.<br />
<br />
From the moment you start the first episode you should fall in love with this show. The animation is enough to pull anybody in. Now, most people who dislike this anime are those who watched the first episode and hated the second. The second episode obviously can&#039;t compare to the first, but as the series progresses the first episode doesn&#039;t even matter anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#039;re looking for a deep story, I admit there are a lot of anime with a better plot. Basquash&#039;s plot is somewhat simple, Young boy has ambitions, shares ambitions with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review16786">
        sister, sister gets in tragic accident, boy hates what created accident, boy decides to use what hurt his sister to his advantage to save/help his sister, while trying to tell with a huge debt( a lot of $ lol). As straightfoward as that may sound, it actually becomes deeper than that, because more main characters are introduced, and this creates a deeper story, romance, rivalries, and even greater humor.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was how I described the plot(word for word) in my first review. Since then, things have changed. An actual plot, i&#039;ll admit a bit cliche, is introduced. As usual there is a conspiracy to destroy...well I guess in the villain&#039;s eyes its &quot;saving&quot; the earth. The moon is on a collision course with earth and the only way to stop this is for &quot;the Legend&quot; to come fourth that has been sent by the Gods(apparently?).<br />
<br />
&quot;As I stated the characters play a major role in how the show progresses(which every anime character should do lol). At first each character introduced seems generic and you can&#039;t stand them at all, but time is taken in developing these characters&#039; personalities until you like them. For example, take Sela, at first she seems like your typical female character who wants nothing more than a male&#039;s genes(scary, i know), but once the anime reaches the Turbine City Arc, Sela&#039;s past is explained, and it turns out she has a poor relationship with her father, who just so happens to play a role in the Turbine City OCB tournament. Wow this is tiring, lol. Then there is Rouge who starts as a simple idol, but turns out that she is being enhanced performance wise to win the OCB tournament, and of course as things unfold as they should, Rouge develops feeling for the main character, and umm...please buy what I&#039;m saying  because I&#039;m spending too much time on the character portion of this thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thats also what I said in my first review. Since then the characters have evolved into much more dynamic characters. Almost everybody falls in love, some with the same people(Oh noes, dere be some DRAMA!). Every character seems to posses their own legend. The main message left by the series is to be &quot;who you are&quot;. For the last few episodes the characters stop trying to fufill this legend prophecy and start being themselves(its a last resort tactic in my eyes).<br />
<br />
Okay, sound. What can i say? The BG Music is amazing! and the first opening theme and the second ending theme are both preformed by Eclipse who also have a role as characters in the show, pretty cool how they tie together. <br />
<br />
Basquash embodies all your generic anime cliches, but ends up making it its own original thing, much like what the main character(Dan is his name by the way, lol) does to the original sport in this anime, and names its after the title of the show.

        Wow I can&#039;t believe there are quite some people who dislike this anime. In my opinion I agree with most that the animation for this anime is terrrific. Great coloring, effects and detail. Many has said that that&#039;s all been wasted on a cliche and uninteresting story plot. Well, I have to respectibly disagree. First, this is a sports anime, and while the plot may not be one of a kind, watching Dan and the others strive for their goals, whatever they may be, is fits perfectly with the mood of the anime. Also, the basquash scenes where to players pit

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15434">
        against each others on their bigfoot are just phenominal! There&#039;s also some humor mixed in here and there, never too much or way over the top, but aways nice to watch. Also, add in the new songs from Elcipse (a new seiyuu band) as the opening and background music, there are scenes where it&#039;ll just take your breath away.<br />
<br />
Overall, in my view, Basquash! is an awsome anime for those who enjoy great animation and loves sports stories mixed with a somewhat serious and funny plot, along with great music. If you fit these catagories, you have my word that you&#039;ll never be bored or disapointed while watching this anime. Everytime I finished an episode, I alwasy wish for more. My rating: 10/10

       the enjoyment of watching Basquash depends on your taste for animes, some people get really disappointed and others enjoyed this series very much. i&#039;m not really a fan of sports animes but this anime sure has some uniqueness to it. <br />
<br />
       as we know, most sports anime will start off in school and later compete with other school then to the nationals and so on... but this anime combines the theme of adventure together with sports, and the characters travel around the world and even to outer space. there&#039;s also a pinch of romance and harem

          <span style="display: none;" id="review20200">
        which makes it even more interesting. <br />
<br />
      when i first read the synopsis, i was thinking, &#039;&#039;why did they need to make a story about robots playing basketballs?&#039;&#039; but later when i watch it, i understand that they were trying to make a story where there are obstacles in the court of a basketball game and that the story is not just about sports but  about sports that could save humans from the end of the world,<br />
<br />
      the funny thing is that this anime is when it is promoting the Nike brand and could get really funny, because every now and then the robots need to change their shoes and sometimes, during climax, you could see the logo.<br />
<br />
      SOUND: the second op and background music during fights were great but the ending songs is below everage.<br />
<br />
      CHARACTER: Some of the characters have a cliche feeling to them except for the princess which is a quite interesting to watch at, very cute and modest at the same time. <br />
<br />
      ART: the art when the robots play basketball was great in the beginning but starts to get worse because later on, you&#039;ll get boring as the ball bounce from building to building and suddenly scores. it&#039;s like watching a pinball game.<br />
 <br />
       OVERALL: a great sports anime with adventures, love and action all the way through

    A beautiful anime, with an animation at its best. Every movement is magical, every landscape breathtaking. <br />
This anime has probably one of the best first episodes EVER to be aired. But that’s all there is to it. From episode two onwards there’s nothing but predictable actions dialogs and possibly the most moronic relationships I have ever seen. If you are a fan only concerned with the animation style of the series this is a MUST WATCH. But if you’re looking for something beyond that, watch the first episode and don’t bother with the rest. It’s not worth the torn hair. <br />

    Basquash is like that first date you have with an interesting person. You are not to sure what to expect and approach it with an open mind. A few minutes into the date and you hit things of and you tell yourself this could be the start of something special. Sadly, as the night progresses you realize you had the wrong impression all along as the date gets worse and worse till you feel like pretending to be sick so you can leave early.<br />
<br />
Art: Pretty amazing for the first 10 episodes or so. Very nice blend using computer generated graphics for the bigfoot and regular

          <span style="display: none;" id="review168655">
        2d art for the characters. The backgrounds and environment all looks lively and the action scenes are very fluid. Sadly the quality starts to deteriorate past episode 10. Action scenes start having pieces of slideshows in them, computer graphics look less outstanding. Character art looks lacking. In the final episodes it did pick back up but not to the quality it had from from the first few episodes.<br />
<br />
Story: You don&#039;t expect much from an anime about playing basketball in giant robots. I wish they had just stick to that instead of it turning into something way too serious half way through the series that came out of no where<br />
<br />
Sound: First opening and ending are pretty damn good. During the first half there will also be some enjoyable instances where they tie the opening song to the idols performing it live before a big game which i thought was a creative concept. Second opening was also good, though not as good as the first. I did not care for the second ending song much. The singing in the second half was also poor compared to the first.<br />
<br />
Characters: This is one of the stronger points of this anime in my opinion. The cast for the most part is pretty likable. Dan and his pet Spanky have some of the most humorous moments I can remember and i always enjoyed the banter between the two throughout the story. I always get excited when Iceman was on the screen shouting out &quot;Destroy!&quot; Each of the 3 main characters all get a mini arc that focuses on them and gives a bit of back story. I do however feel like there were certain characters in the show that really didn&#039;t serve much purpose in regards to the progression of the story.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: The first half was one of the most enjoyable moments I&#039;ve had watching anime recently. Sadly, it pains me to say it gets pretty boring half way through to the point where I was forcing myself to continue hoping things would pick back up. The last couple episodes were decent enough but no where close to how amazing the first part of the series was.<br />
<br />
Overall I&#039;d give Basquash a 5/10. The first half itself scores a 8/10 in my book but things really went downhill. The ending though decent didn&#039;t have the fireworks I was expecting when I first started watching the series.

    My Verdict: Must-Watch<br />
<br />
this is my first review and i thought that this series deserves to be my first. At first glance, I thought that the main character looked like a bug. I never really heard of this anime before but sometimes your like &quot;what the heck&quot;. Anyways I&#039;m glad I did because this anime is one of those hidden jewels. This anime has robots and basketball. I dislike them both in anime, so a combo I thought was gonna be badd. but again I was wrong. This show has got a ton of those heart pumping moments, great characters, and just a cool story. If

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25486">
        this anime stopped at episode 10, I would of given it a 10 for masterpiece. But it doesn&#039;t. It goes untill 26, and while normally this would be sweet, it&#039;s actually kind of bitter. It&#039;s because they get a new director or producer or whatever.... I&#039;m not really sure.&quot; If it ain&#039;t broke don&#039;t fix it&quot; is what I say. Still They mange to save it after episode 12, and things are almost over. Anyways srry for the long review. My Verdict: Must Watch.

    SPOILERS UP AHEAD<br />
<br />
“DESTROY! DESTROY! DESUTOROIIIIIIIIIIIII!”<br />
<br />
Seriously, I began to lost count of just how much I heard that single word over and over the course of animation studio Satelight’s (which I have never heard of) 26 episode original anime – Basquash!<br />
<br />
Hmmmm, yes. That’s actually quite a peculiar name. Just what does it mean? Surely it must have something to with bad boys playing squash. Ah, no. That’s wrong. Well, is it a fighting anime? ‘Basquash’ sure does sound like a sound effect for beating someone up – both sexually and non-sexually, of course. Nuh-uh, wrong again.<br />
<br />
Then just what is Basquash! all about? It’s, uh, well about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221224">
        basketball being played by guys in semi-giant robots which eventually ends up saving the day. Yup.<br />
<br />
Now you must be thinking why would any sane person watch something with a premise as dumb as this. Yeah, that’s what I thought too when a friend recommended this anime too. I said to myself, “Well, I do like playing basketball and I guess mechas are cool. And the guy recommending does have good taste. Meh, let’s see how this turns out.”<br />
<br />
And to my surprise, it didn’t just turn out fine. No. It was even better than I expected.<br />
<br />
Basquash! is quite literally one of the main reasons why I love watching anime so much. I mean, a group of people gathered somewhere and decided that a show about mecha-basketball saving the dystopian day would actually sell. And, wow. They actually made it really interesting with quality visuals and sound to boot. Satelight, the mad-studio, he actually did it. Haha!<br />
<br />
The first half of Basquash! is pretty much background for what’s to come later and an introduction of the many characters of the show. Dan JD, the main character, hates Bigfoot Basketball (bigfoots are mechas) due to an accident which caused his little sister to lose her legs. Donning the persona of Dunk Mask, Dan goes around town smashing TVs which showcase Bigfoot Basketball matches and causing general mayhem. A childhood sweetheart, Miyuki, then comes back to town and shows Dan the errors of his ways and also instills the love of Bigfoot Basketball in him. And that’s where the journey begins.<br />
<br />
After a couple of instances of chaos and a year-long prison sentence later, Dan is seeing as a legend all over the place with his rad ball skills. He then meets Sela, the cliche girl with hidden issues, and Iceman Hottie (lol ), the source of “DESTROY!”. They then eventually form a team thanks to Haruka ‘McTits’ and play Dan’s version of chaotic ‘is this even a sport anymore?’  basketball all over the world to gain fame and a chance to go the heaven that is Mooneyes where all the rich people live.<br />
<br />
Yeah, that’s pretty sums up the first half. The second half of the show is where things boosted up to a whole new level.<br />
<br />
In a radically bizarre twist akin to that of Kill la Kill, the Dan’s planet Earthdash and Mooneyes are in danger of destruction and Dan and his buddies have to save the worlds with the help of Dan’s version of basketball which he calls ‘Basquash’.<br />
<br />
I’m not going to get too much into the second half because I wholeheartedly recommend this show and want people to experience the greatness themselves. However, I will talk about a few specific stuff.<br />
<br />
Firstly, character development finally takes precedence in the second part as the over-arching plot is gradually revealed. Iceman finally gets a grip on himself and starts saying “DEATH TO TROOOOOOOOY!” a little less. Romance blooms between Dan and Rouge, a girl from a rival basquash playing idol group. Rouge becomes a very important character later on so [REDACTED].<br />
<br />
Secondly, the ending is super rushed. It should have taken a good two or three episodes to come to a proper conclusion. But for some reason, the anime just ended in an instant and you were left confused with no clue as to how the hell did the worlds just get saved. I had to re-watch the last episode just to figure this out and even then, it was just so half-assed, it left a poor taste in my mouse. Another problem with the ending is that it’s open-ended. Many things are left unanswered and there is no conclusion to Dan’s love plot.<br />
<br />
For the first 10 episodes or so, the animation is smooth and slick with heavy detailing everywhere. The CGI for the bigfoots blend perfectly with the 2D elements of the show and this is just a pleasure to look at. Even the Basquash matches have the greatness of cool fighting scenes. Sadly, though, the animation quickly deteriorates after these episodes. It becomes rough, the detailing takes a hike, and the Basquash matches start looking like slideshows of stills.<br />
<br />
The background music is just… wow. If I had to describe it in one word, it would be ‘pumped’. Whenever the electrical guitar piece, which sounds like a mix of traditional Arabian music and underground techno, starts playing I get all upbeat and ready for action. Even the dramatic background music plays at the perfect times and really softens you up. And then there’s the “Running On” track that plays during a crucial scene with Dan and Rouge. Just amazing.<br />
<br />
I didn’t like the first Opening. The first hip-hop Ending was a neat song. The second Opening took some warming up to. Same goes for the second Ending which is a generic idol song but somehow hooks you up.<br />
<br />
Sure, I do have quite the qualms with certain parts of the plot. First of all, it just took a while to take in the fact that I was actually enjoying a show about psuedo-basketball saving the worlds. But then I also reminded myself that I had greatly enjoyed Kill la Kill and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagaan so that matter was resolved easily. And then there’s also the fact the first half of the show has a lot of visual and story continuity errors.<br />
<br />
But, I still massively enjoyed Basquash! and I hope you will too so, I’m going to give it a lofty score of and 8 out of 10.

    I find it difficult to explain why I loved Basquash!, but the point still stands that I enjoyed it from beginning to end. <br />
The only way I can describe Basquash! is by comparing it to other popular anime. So... Basquash! is pretty much a mix of those kids anime like: Bakugan, Bayblade, Pokemon, Digimon... Those ecchi anime like: Highschool DxD, Highschool of the Dead, the ecchi parts of No Game No Life... Those bat shit insane anime like: Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Kill la Kill, Fooly Cooly, JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure ... Those regular shounen like: One Piece, Bleach, Fairy Tail... Those mecha anime that focus

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263604">
        more on the story and character aspects rather then the mechas like: Code Geass, Neon Genesis Evangelion, the aforementioned Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann,  And those sports anime like: Kuroko no Basket, Haikyuu!!, Hajime no Ippo... Now you might be wondering how I made all these connections and unfortunately it&#039;s because I turned off my brain for the entirety of Basquash!. I forgave all the minor flaws by just not caring, but some flaws stuck though. I was expecting an above average sports anime with well choreographed scenes and since mecha and sports aren&#039;t my favourite genres I wasn&#039;t expecting much more than just a fun little show that keeps me busy for the weekend. And from the first few episodes it did just that, until it started veering over to the bizarre side. From the fact that boobs growing bigger on the moon, the fact that someone yelling destroy and throwing the ball as hard as he could was the way he attacked opponents and passed the ball to teammates, the fact that a princess pretended to be a boy to join the group, the fact that they never bothered explaining what the animals people have or their bodies do and why they stick to them. The fact that the main villain has glasses the size of his head&#039;s height...<br />
To put it it bluntly, Basquash! was a thrilling experience and one I wasn&#039;t expecting to enjoy as much as I did. It has a hell of a lot of flaws, but they didn&#039;t devalue the experience, if anything they improved it.<br />
<br />
Story: 10<br />
The story was not what I was expecting, it turned on it&#039;s head so many times it even makes Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann jealous. I enjoyed that the only force strong enough to stop a practiced and skillful army was a boy and a basketball. Also the characters hop in and out of the story so much it might as well been a sitcom.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
When it comes to the first few episodes the anime looks gorgeous, but after a while the animation loses it charm and the direction it had in the first few episodes was spectacular. If it kept it&#039;s quality animation this anime might have been close to a perfect 10<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
The only problem I had with the music was the fact that they used the OP&#039;s theme song a couple of times and most of them have been still shots of characters talking over and some shots of the match.<br />
<br />
Characters: 10<br />
Every character is loveable in their own way. They were able to pull of quite the show in terms of comedy, depth, romance and I enjoyed them a lot.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
My rating system revolves mostly on my enjoyment of the show, which isn&#039;t to say that the other categories were boosted because of my enjoyment, but my enjoyment decides whether or not an anime deserves to be a certain score. And if it&#039;s comedy and randomness wasn&#039;t present Basquash! would have been a 7 or an 8 at best.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10<br />
If you&#039;re going to watch Basquash! you need not take it seriously. It is a show that thrives on being random and making you enjoy every second of the ride, even though you will need to turn your brain off to enjoy it to it&#039;s fullest.

    This won&#039;t be an extensive review but I&#039;ll just make some points that I want to mention.<br />
<br />
The art and sound I had no real issues with. In fact, the last opening theme was my favorite and I could not stop singing along! Very wonderful and enjoyable.<br />
<br />
The story and Dan&#039;s character is where critiques come in. SPOILER WARNING!!<br />
<br />
At first, Dan starts off as this rowdy and loud character that is worried about his sister&#039;s future in an adorable way that makes him sorta cliche, but not entirely. He has moments where he is vulnerable and you see his true colors. One thing that kind of upsets

          <span style="display: none;" id="review245723">
        me is that there was absolutely no talk of his sister&#039;s legs at all in the later episodes. He made no mention of it once he started playing Basquash and only said he had to &quot;get to the moon&quot;. That&#039;s it? Of course, healing his sister is implied but it shouldn&#039;t be. His overall goal throughout the series should be towards healing his sister. Instead, it turned into a save-the-world plot? A bit odd for a sports anime.<br />
Like I mentioned, Dan wants to get to the moon in the beginning in order to take his sister with him. Emphasis on TAKE HIS SISTER WITH. Yet she goes there on her own with Slash and isn&#039;t even treated right away. Meanwhile, Dan is decreasingly concerned about her well-being. As the show goes along, he focuses more on Basquashing, which is fine, but it seems like there can only be one thing to focus on at a time with him.<br />
As for the &quot;saving the world&quot; bit: it may have a place in this anime, but the whole idea of the Gods playing basketball is over-doing it. If instead, he had to save the world for a different reason other than &quot;he&#039;s the legend it has to be him&quot; and &quot;It&#039;s what I am now&quot;. I would have liked for him to stick to his roots/original focus more, which is being rowdy and doing what he pleases, without having this thing about Gods/Legends influence him.<br />
However, I do like the fact that he is dedicated to Basquash throughout the show. He plays for his love of the sport, yet later on it adds this sense of necessity to be what the people expect of him.<br />
Overall, the story and Dan&#039;s character were both fun to watch but need  improvements.<br />
<br />
This does not mean that I did not thoroughly enjoy this anime, even if I am a bit late in watching it! 10/10 would recommend!

    This is a very stereotypical anime. An original story line for the most part, music was great (no lame traditional music),  art was unique, Kinda like michiko to hachin had a baby with gurren lagann. It was a good anime in the fact that it wasn&#039;t predictable the whole way through. It left out so much information, that the audience had to guess a lot through it the whole time. I was kinda hoping for a little romance to happen the whole time between protagonist Dan JD and supporting character Miyuki but it never happens, for all we know Dan is gay, but the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32333">
        anime never tells. It just has an awkward feel, because there&#039;s three girls that you think likes him, and you&#039;re just confused who it&#039;s going to be the whole way through, and it&#039;s a let down to never know. But other then that it was great! Few animes make me laugh but i caught myself chuckling a few time throughout this anime. Great resolving ending without too many questions and doesn&#039;t piss you off. What this anime if you like action, because it has really intricate art movement art.
