        accosted from behind by one of the men, forcefed a drug intended to kill him, and knocked out.  <br /><br />When Shin&#039;ichi wakes up, he finds that the drug didn&#039;t kill him, but has caused his body to shrink down to the size of a seven-year-old boy.  Shin&#039;ichi confides in his neighbor, the crazy scientest Hiroshi Agasa, who informs him not to tell anybody else about his condition for the safety of those around him and provides his with gadgets to help him around, such as a bowtie that can duplicate any voice and a wrist stun-gun used to put people to sleep.  Shin&#039;ichi then goes under the alias &quot;Conan Edogawa&quot; to conceal his identity.  In order to get information about the men responsible for his small body, he lives as a surrogate brother to Ran and helps out her father, Kogoro Mouri, who is a mediocre detective with poor deduction skills.<br /><br />Following Kogoro on cases assigned to him, Conan tries to help behind the scenes any way he can.  The problem is that no professionals want to listen to a kid&#039;s advice, so &quot;Conan&quot; deducts as other work.  After balancing out all the evidence, he gets everyone&#039;s attention through knocking Kogoro out with a stungun, hiding behind him, and dupliicating his voice while explaining the case.  <br /><br />While not that popular of an anime in North America (despite finding a fair audience among Americans), Conan has a great amount of success in Japan, spanning more than 450 episodes(and STILL GOING!!), 55 tankoban, 10 movies, and 16 OVAs.  <br /><br />At first I thought this anime wasn&#039;t all that interesting and was poorly animated (stopped thinking that after finding it was made in 1996), but after watching the dub more on Adult Swim, I got more attached to the characters, storyline, and everthing that made the show so admirable.  For two years I watching both the English and Japanese versions, bought merchandise, and tried to work my way up to the current story development in the manga.  <br /><br />Leaving off the personal experience bits I thought about putting in, I&#039;ll get to the qualities that make &quot;Detective Conan&quot;such a favorite to the Japanese and other nationalities as well.  <br /><br />Now starting with the artwork, I&#039;ll have to go out on a limb and say that it can take some adjusting to at first, with the pointy, &quot;barely-there&quot; noses, the round eyes, and &quot;jug ears&quot; and all the other oddities in the art.  It&#039;ll eventually grow on you, nonetheless.  Also, the artstyle advances to higher quality in both the anime and manga as animation methods and improve as well as Aoyama&#039;s drawing skills, so the artwork still is able to better itself.  <br /><br />The background music for the series really gives it that &quot;classic detective drama&quot; feel.  It&#039;s a combination of jazz, some saxophone jams both slow and quick, as well as some themes that play in the background on occasion.   It sets teh atmosphere and tone for the format and purpose for the playing of the episodes.  <br /><br />The cast of characters starts to build thoughout the series, from the tough but sensitive Ran and the overconfident Kogoro to the brooding Ai Hiabara and the individual members of the Metropolitan Police Force.  All of them have distinct personalities that may not develop quickly, but are interesting to explore while watching this long series.<br /><br />The cases, murder cases, suicide cases, puzzles, kidnappings, and cases involving those men in black and their organization, are so brilliantly laid out.  You just want to watch every darned bit of the episode to see the conclusion.  The way Shin&#039;ichi uses his logic in each episode just makes one think, &quot;Whoa.  This show&#039;s amazing.&quot;   And the series can get somebody hooked with just deductions alone.   However the episodes play out in almost the same format, kind of like Law &amp; Order, with the same episode formula, but different twists and clever setups in the cases that keep viewers coming back for more every time.   <br /><br />Overall, &quot;Detective Conan&quot; is all that and a bag of chips, being possibly my ultimate favorite as well as the favorite of many other fans.   It can be a bit boring for those that hate being overloaded with details, but mystery fans and intellectuals are bound to love it.

    Detective Conan is beyond your average detective anime. What i mean &quot;beyond your average&quot; is that it definitely got &quot;everything&quot; in it. Likely said, it has the funny moments (Humors), it got also Love story (Romance),the Drama, silce of life they do have the very unique plots of stories some are based on the Mysteries (we have know of) and that you will soon know through watching the series, It will give you the thrills and chills because its more than just the crime scene or solving crime since there are storyline which people called arcs. It also let us know more of japan&#039;s culture

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37032">
        and traditions, you could learn japanese as well (yeah, this is the only anime which i learn/know alot of japanese more than any other animes). You would know also the life of occupations of people in real life and for the overall, as the anime progresses it really gives you the satisfaction (even have movies,ovas,specials and magic files). <br />
<br />
What&#039;s more fun about it, is that you can exercise your detective skills on who is the culprit on this case. If you got it right, thats a job well done for you and if not, you will get to improve yourself more and more. <br />
<br />
The Story follows the adventures of Shinichi Kudo (also known as Jimmy Kudo in Case Closed) a Prodigious young detective who was inadvertently transformed into a child due to poison. It was all started when Shinichi Kudo was in suspicious of the two men dressed in all black. He went to investigate those persons in outskirts of Tropical Land, but only to find out unaware one of the suspicious man in blacks knocks him out from behind and gives him a prototype poison to kill him. And instead of dying because of that poison, it he made him shrinks down to the size of a seven year old. He was suggested by his close friend and Professor Agasa that must keep his identity secret because the Black Organization will kill him and others associated with him should they discover the truth. He will be renaming himself Edogawa Conan to hide his identity in order to protect his beloved ones. He later moves into Ran and Mouri Kogoro. <br />
<br />
Even as Conan, he still continues in solving cases one after the other, He help build up Kogoro&#039;s reputation in hoping to find cases related to the syndicate called the Black Organization, who were responsible for his transformation in the first place. <br />
<br />
Known as Case Closed &amp; Meitantei Conan; Creator/Artist: Gosho Aoyama<br />
Since:  Anime: Jan 8, 1996  &amp; Manga: Feb 4, 1994 (both on-going)<br />
<br />

    &quot;I&#039;m not a fan of detective themed shows.&quot; Psh. What the hell do you think this is? Scooby Doo? CSI? Law and Order? Get out. Detective Conan is entirely different. And at the same time, it is the mystery/detective genre at its BEST.<br />
<br />
Gosho Aoyama&#039;s most well known creation tells the story of 16 year old Kudo Shinichi; genius high school detective who one day witnessed illegal trade while on a date at a theme park with his childhood friend Mouri Ran. He is then struck from behind the back of the head with a metal bat by mysterious men wearing all black, and is forced

          <span style="display: none;" id="review100897">
        to consume an experimental drug that was supposed to kill him, but is instead transformed into a 7 year old boy while maintaining his intellect. To track down these men, he conceals his true identity to protect his loved ones from any sort of danger and opts to live with his childhood friend because her father owns a detective agency and believes that information regarding the mysterious men may be reported to this agency. This marks the beginning of endless encounters and <br />
complicated mysteries, most of which only he can solve.<br />
<br />
I was immediately captivated when I started watching Detective Conan in 2003. I was 14 years old and by then it was already a fairly old anime that made its premier 7 years prior. I am now 24 years old. Making it&#039;s debut in 1996, it has produced over 600 episodes in roughly 20 seasons, over 16 movies, countless OVAs and is STILL going strong. Detective Conan is my favorite anime of ALL TIME. Yeah, i said it. Where do I begin with such a flat out brilliant series? Everything about the anime is simply extraordinary. But what really makes Detective Conan, as well as what makes it my all-time favorite anime all comes down to two things. The first one is the <br />
exquisite writing. <br />
<br />
The cases and mysteries in this anime are mind blowing. I can&#039;t emphasize this enough. The writer is a GENIUS. This show is a sigh of relief from the Scooby-Doo inspired cartoons that presented mysteries to you, that a blind donkey could solve in 20 seconds. The storylines are all well thought out, and the solutions to mysteries are NOT obvious, but can be solved by an observant viewer who thinks, just as Conan does. There will be many cases where you will be utterly stunned by the cleverness of the solution. Whether it&#039;s the murder cases, the romance elements, or the comedy factors, every episode is very well-put together. I learn something new JUST about every episode due to the fact that the writers put so much heart and effort into their work. One example being episode 616 takes place in London. Don&#039;t worry, this review is spoiler free, so keep reading. Did you know that Gosho Aoyama personally went to London himself to gather materials and data at the exact places <br />
the scenes take place during the anime, due to the fact that the main character (Kudo shinichi) is a Sherlock Holmes freak, and he wanted to give the scenes and story of the birthplace of Sherlock Holmes justice? Pretty impressive and praise worthy if you ask me. Anyways, aside from the various ways to kill someone, it teaches you about japanese tradition/culture, medical terminology, world famous structures/figures, and much much more. I soak up Detective Conan like water to a sponge. I get so absorbed and drawn into every episode, that everything around me becomes irrelevant and it&#039;s just me and the episode. It&#039;s captivating. There is no other word for it. EVERY episode is fresh, and EVERY mystery that is solved is profound. The series has wide appeal and I would say it is one of the few shounen animes I have seen that <br />
breaks down age barriers with ease. This is a series that plays to adults just as well, if not more so than to children. I occasionally watch this with my 56 year old father, and can say that he can enjoy watching it as well.<br />
<br />
The story is broken into 2 kinds of arcs. I call them the &quot;main arc&quot; and the &quot;everyday arc&quot;. The &quot;everyday arcs&quot; reside over small, one to two episode cases that occur on a normal daily basis, and sometimes have generally nothing to do with the main arc, but are usually very interesting in their own right. These are NOT filler episodes. They are simply everyday occurences that the main cast go through on a daily basis, waiting patiently for clues to make progress. Then there&#039;s the &quot;main arc&quot;. The &quot;main arc&quot; is of course the main storyline and the episodes where progress between the main characters and the main plot advance forward.  Getting to watch these episodes that allow the main storyline to progress is similar to the feeling of receiving all the presents you wanted on Christmas day because you waited ever so patiently to get them. Sure the same cycle/pattern occurs almost every episode. And by this cycle I mean that someone dies, and someone is caught as the culprit. But these patterns are executed with grace and near flawlessness that allow you to never get tired of watching this cycle. There is a build up of hype and anxiousness that make you want to see progress of the &quot;main arc&quot;. There are usually long waits between episodes where the plot moves forward, but if you&#039;re patient enough, you&#039;ll be rewarded with an unbelievable storyline you will NEVER forget. Most fans, myself included, seem to have grown accustomed to this style and have come to enjoy it.<br />
<br />
The second factor that really makes this anime is none other than the characters. What would the show be without it&#039;s godly cast of characters? Nothing. <br />
Each character is engaging and filled with so much depth and personality, it&#039;s hard NOT to love every single one of them. In short, I TRULY believe that they are the greatest cast I&#039;ve seen as a whole, in ANY anime series that I&#039;ve ever watched. I love these characters. The episodes that have the occasional reccuring characters appear, are the ones that you will truly enjoy. The relationships and interactions between the main characters and these reccurring characters is character synergy at it&#039;s maximum level. I won&#039;t go into any detail about specific characters because that would spoil the whole thing for those who have yet to watch Detective Conan. And if by chance you were to start watching from episode 1, and the character art is too old for you, I&#039;d have to remind you that this anime was started in 1996 and the <br />
character art has since been modernized and revamped. Give it time and I PROMISE it WILL grow on you. Anyways, putting all these factors into words to describe these god-like character creations will never be enough to capture how BEAST they truly are. You&#039;d have to watch it to understand.<br />
<br />
The catchphrase for this anime is “There is always only one truth!”... And the truth is, this anime Kicks Ass.<br />

    At first glance you&#039;d think its your typical CSI-themed anime, however Detective Conan dishes out much more than that. If you&#039;re a fan of sherlock holmes, agatha christie or simply likes a challenging and entertaining series to watch, then you must not miss this. Each cases shows different clever, cunning, and even devilishly simple ways of committing a crime! The solutions are well-explained, and teaches readers the logic behind each reasoning. The cases are varied, ranging from simple to sometimes gruesome murders. The characters are pretty effective, and I&#039;m sure people will like them more with each episodes they watch. There&#039;s plenty of comedy, as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review2135">
        well as drama and suspense. What&#039;s more, the never-ending question of when Ran and Shinichi will admit their feelings is one of the key factors why you have to get glued to this series. Frankly, I&#039;m happy that the series is this long, because whoever wants a good thing to end?

    I&#039;m writing this, facing the fact that I&#039;ve never written one, simply because this outstanding Anime deserves more and better reviews.<br />
<br />
<br />
Detective Conan, or Case Closed in the United States, is first and foremost a mystery Anime. Elements of action, adventure, romance, and comedy are all thrown into the mix, making DC quite an entertaining anime.<br />
<br />
At the time of writing this, Conan is at it&#039;s 542nd episode aired, and around 700th Manga chapter released. That&#039;s over 10 years of content, still going strong, quite a feat to me.<br />
<br />
Synopsis: Kudou Shinichi is an ace high-school detective. One day he runs into trouble with some shady men while

          <span style="display: none;" id="review17046">
        solving a case, and is forced to take poison that reverts his body back to a child-like state. He takes upon the alias of Conan Edogawa, and lives at his childhood friend&#039;s (Mouri Ran) house, with her Private Detective Father Mouri Kogorou. He follows them around, helping to solve Mouri&#039;s cases in hopes of getting one step closer to unlocking the identities of the secret organization that poisoned him, hoping to put them behind bars and gain his normal body back at the same time.<br />
<br />
Story: The story is broken into large arcs that reside over small, one to two episode cases (Occasionally a 2 hour special) Sometimes the episodes have generally nothing to do with the larger arc, but are usually very exciting in their own right. Most fans, such as myself, seem to have gotten used to this style and have come to enjoy it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: The art for the first 200 episodes is obviously not the best at meeting today&#039;s standards, with rough sketches and little to no CG, but it is what it is and is certainly able to be looked past. After about episode 250, the art gets progressively better and more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: Sound in Detective Conan is absolutely fantastic. The openings and endings will give you songs to listen to for years. The background music is phenomenal, being mostly produced by Katsuo Ono band, it is something to be revered. The mood these themes emit sync perfectly with the situation at hand, quite seamlessly at that. I myself can listen to &quot;Main theme&quot; for hours, specifically the Tengoku version.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character: Detective Conan has a very wide array of characters, each one with a detailed background and important role to play in the overall story. One thing that gets people into this series is the love for it&#039;s characters. You have to watch to understand.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I&#039;ve never enjoyed an anime more so than DC. Some episodes leave you howling in laughter, while others leave you clutching your chair in suspense. It&#039;s almost ridiculous. I&#039;m not one for making reactions whilst watching anime, but Detective Conan does that to me. <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: Simply put, Detective Conan is my favorite anime for a reason. It has a very large cast of characters, a wide array of morals and themes, and pertains to a large audience. Some moments can be childishly funny, while others are quite serious and pertain to even the darkest of subject matter. DC is a very unique anime, and time-tested at that. If you are not hooked at first, give it time, this series will drag you into it&#039;s world until you&#039;re already at episode 542 craving for the 543rd.

    	I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with Detective Conan.  At it&#039;s core it&#039;s a very clever and fun show, with writing that is both amazingly good and amazingly bad.  It offers some of the most creative and interesting murder mysteries available anywhere, that are always amazing in how much insane bullshit they pull off.  I&#039;ve been keeping up with the series, and it&#039;s well over 600 episodes at this point.  Sadly it&#039;s not able to keep up in quality, and all the promise of it&#039;s earlier episodes is slowly fading away.  For quite a while now it&#039;s ran

          <span style="display: none;" id="review43797">
        out of good ideas, and all that&#039;s left are it&#039;s annoying cliches.  It&#039;s a show that does so much right, but still fails on many aspects.<br />
	As the series grows longer and longer it gets more and more dependent on various cliches that grow old very, very quickly.  One of it&#039;s greatest flaws is it&#039;s padding.  Each episode is dragged out far longer than it needs to be, by adding constant exposition (usually given by Sonoko, who has at this point has almost been completely devolved into an exposition machine.  I feel that she is used far too much, and it seems that lately she is being used to solve mysteries far more often than the great Sleeping Kogoro... but I digress).  All padding hurts, and this series has some really deep hurting.  Recently almost half of every episode consists of useless exposition about the suspects/victim or constant repetition of information regarding cases that we already knew.<br />
	Sadly having seen far too much of the series certain patterns begin to emerge, and it becomes hard to take the series serious anymore.  At this point it&#039;s almost devolved into a drinking game, where I see how many cliches I can spot in a single episode.  Almost always you can figure out who the victim will be with a few minutes of them being introduced.  Each victim is always the biggest douche bag of the group, and the show puts far too much effort in to making them seem as such.  I understand why a story would paint a victim as a jerk, but it destroys any sense of suspense and dramatic tension when you can tell that they are just going to die as soon as they are introduced.  A victim who is actually sympathetic does have us emotionally involved in finding the culprit, not indifferent because the dead person was a poorly written asshole whose death doesn&#039;t really deserve justice.  Also the trend of making the motivation being that the victim was somehow responsible for the death of someone who is in one way or another related to the murderer is really getting old, especially when we only find out about it when they are revealed as the murderer.<br />
	Additionally I have some other complaints, the biggest and most infuriating one being Kaitou Kid.  When he was introduced early in the series, he was possibly one of the coolest characters in all of anime.  He was Lupin, minus all the terrible bullshit that plagued that franchise.  I was in love, I wanted to see him show up as much as possible, and wanted a great rivalry to develop.  This sadly never came.  Instead Kaitou Kid became AWOL for roughly two hundred episodes, and then whenever he showed up the episode would be inevitably terrible.  Once Sonoko&#039;s uncle shows up, all hope is lost.  Kaitou Kid can never be cool again, the character is pretty much ruined, which saddens me to no end.  I suppose I should have given up hope early on, when in a special they had pre-Conanized Shinichi matching whits with Kid.  This could have been interesting, and set the stages for their rivalry, except for the fact that it&#039;s COMPLETELY NONCANON.  Kaitou Kid became Kaitou Kid when he was introduced, before that he was just a normal... well weird high school student, but not a thief.  He began his life of crime after Shinichi shrunk, thus making that entire special not fit into the series in any was, and since it was terrible anyway, it marked Kaitou Kid&#039;s slow and tragic death.<br />
	My last complaint is one that I know is pointless, but I still feels need to be made.  A series with this long a run, and with no real end in sight will obviously have it&#039;s main love story go no where.  The problem is that they keep trying to make it a central plot element, but we know nothing will happen.  If it were kept in the background this wouldn&#039;t bother me, but when something we know will go nowhere become a primary focus I can&#039;t help but be annoyed.  The series keeps trying to make up care, but because we know it will never go anywhere I can&#039;t help but care.  There is no tension, I know what will happen, and it will be an anticlimactic cop out.<br />
	With all that said, Detective Conan is a very good series.  For the first few hundred episodes it is amazing and does do many things right.  It starts to fall apart after the Vermouth plot arc, which is by far the best part of the show.  I won&#039;t give any spoilers, because it&#039;s something that really needs to be seen, but I do have to make the observation that a certain other character is the actual main character, and after that plot arc it becomes clear that Conan has little impact on the real plot of the show.  The change in quality starts around when the animation style starts to change.  When it made the switch to digital animation, it started to look worse and it&#039;s quality started to make a gradual slide in the negative direction.<br />
	What the series does right (when it&#039;s not having the god damn kids going on another fucking camping trip.  Seriously how many times are they going to have the plot of Professor Agasa goes on a camping trip with the kids, some sort of even causes them to be in someone&#039;s house, someone gets murdered and the kids are annoying for forty minutes.  For Christ&#039;s sake the kid&#039;s have seen more dead bodies than most coroners are going to see over the course of their career... but anyway), it does very right.  As mentioned before when it bothers to have a plot it tends to be pretty good, at least through the Vermouth plot arc.  After that it starts becoming a bit predictable, but still interesting.  Oddly enough the thing I like the most about the series is it&#039;s side characters.<br />
	Although I find the primary love story to be completely pointless and annoying the other love subplots are almost always entertaining.  The Satou and Takagi love arc is one of my favorite pairings in all of anime, and it actually develops over time.  Whenever a “Metropolitan Police Love Story” episode showed up I would always get excited because those never disappointed.  Also Kazuha and Heiji are characters I always have fun with.  Primarily this is because Kazuha is played by Yuko Miyamura and anything with her doing a Kansai accent is automatically amazing.  The fact that the series insists on having their relationship never go anywhere is rather frustrating, but it shows up rarely enough to never get annoying.  Truthfully I that Heiji had his own spinoff series, it certain would be better that the Kaitou Kid one, that just serves to put even more nails into a coffin that at this point has more sharp steel than wood left.<br />
	Overall Detective Conan is a series that is very much worth watching, but not worth keeping up with.  My suggestion is get up to the Vermouth plot arc and then keep going until you start to get annoyed.  Once it starts getting old, it doesn&#039;t get any better and just ages rapidly from there.  The series will probably go another decade or so, but it most likely won&#039;t get any better.  It&#039;s a series that has ran out material.  The material it had was amazing, but there are only so many murders you can pull off with a combination of locked rooms, fishing line and packing tape.  It set up a good formula at the beginning, but once Sleeping Kogoro stopped being the primary method of solving crimes, it lost it&#039;s magic.

    Detective Conan, a.k.a Case Closed<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
Well this series is mainly about Crime Scene Investigation. If you&#039;re a crime-investigator oriented person, you would definitely like it. The series depicts the cases of a young private detective who was inadvertently turned into a prepubescent boy by a certain criminal organization. Although his body has been shrunk, he continues to solve many cases and is struggling to solve the mysteries of the criminal organization responsible in order to return to his normal body. You will really find it quite interesting and curious. If you think you&#039;re smarter than Conan, try to solve the case before he does.<br />
The only

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1685">
        problem is Detective Mouri just keeps falling every time and Conan speaks behind, without anyone noticing him too much...<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
This started on 1996 so you pretty much know what the animation is. Then it keeps improving, colors, background, effects, etc till now... <br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
The opening and ending themes are really very good. I have no bad comments on it. Only during background song tracks when it comes to an end. When it comes to a case closed, you&#039;ll hear sad piano song and it makes the story touch you inside. But hearing it over and over on the episodes (1-100) really makes it expectable.<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
Outstanding. The characters are really explained and introduced well. Even suspects and victims are introduced nicely. It what makes you solve the case yourself before Conan does.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
I enjoy this show very much since it makes me puzzled and keeps my brain working... Including laughs on some comedy scenes where stupidity comes to place.... I watch it with my friends mostly and we make bets to whom is the suspect, and luckily, I win most times XD... It is really enjoying since you get curious for most times &amp;quot;Who killed who?&amp;quot; you ask yourself, and to find out that you&#039;re suspicion is wrong against Conan.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10<br />
Nothing much to say... I really recommend it to people who enjoys watching crime investigations - included Comedy...

    Become smarter and learn from Conan. Kid’s a genius. From knowing every mathematical equations (he knows quantum physics too), to solving murder cases with Detective skills, to catching criminals with a soccer ball, kid Conan can do it all. If you haven’t watched Detective Conan yet, start watching so you can become smart too.

    I have been a huge fan of shonen since the original Dragonball was on Cartoon Network about..I dunno...maybe 7 years ago? At times, I could almost say I am somewhat easily amused by the typical shonen anime, filled with action and adventure with tons of character development and dialogue to explain every single thing that is going on. You know the type I&#039;m talking about. As at least some of us know, shonen is not just those type of anime. It&#039;s a word to describe the target audience: young boys. It is surprising to see how many unexpectedly different types of anime and manga have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19679">
        shonen as the target audience.<br />
<br />
My point is that this is not one of those different types of anime. Yet at the same time it is. Basically, this IS a Detective anime. There are tons of cases and mysteries in this series and Conan Edogawa is pretty much always one who has to solve them. However, it is done in such a way that at times it feels like they took a typical action adventure shonen and replaced fights and magic with cases and deduction. It is very interesting and done in a way that made me a fan of the detective genre, something I thought would never happen.<br />
<br />
Story: The story is done in a very interesting way. I&#039;m sure not everyone will like it but considering the continued popularity of the series, it sure as hell worked. In the first 100 episodes (ignoring filler, which we almost all hate anyway),  the plot everyone wants to see (anything involving those &quot;men in black&quot; that gave Shinichi the drug that turned him into Conan) almost never goes anywhere and instead focuses on random cases and some fun character development (mainly involving Shinichi/Conan&#039;s love interest, Ran). The individual stories of the cases are so great however, that you can&#039;t really complain. But either way, after the first 100 or so episodes, the story goes in the direction of having a few episodes that has character development for the many characters in the series for every one episode that involves those men in black (although the main plot is probably not what you think it is, if you haven&#039;t seen the series). <br />
<br />
The main plot is always interesting, exciting and quite mysterious. It makes you wonder what will happen next pratically everytime a plot episode happens. The fact that cases are not connected from one case to the next to the one after that etc. almost always makes it seem much more different from anything I&#039;ve ever seen that has such interesting long term storylines. It also makes it so that almost each case usually has a guest character (who appear once in a while and have importance to the main plot or the side plots) that make the case that much more interesting, no matter how little or how much character development there is.<br />
<br />
With the exception of one particular character, the major side plots that don&#039;t involve the main plot are usually relationship related plots. They are really fun more often instead of being truly deep or emotional (at least in my opinion) but they are interesting so I honestly think that&#039;s more than ok.<br />
<br />
The cases themselves deserve mention. Despite usually being only two episodes, many times these cases become tragic and sad (someone died so that&#039;s obvious I guess. And almost always the culprit has damn good motives to kill the person so it is extremely well done).<br />
<br />
I will say that if you have ADD and need to see major plot development often then this is probably not your anime. But people who wait long enough will love the plot.<br />
<br />
(The rest of the review should be fairly short compared to this. I think.)<br />
<br />
Art: The art is pretty great. In the first nearly 300 episodes it is kinda uninteresting an art style but it works perfectly for a somewhat realistic detective anime. The art style after that was much better and did the same thing without being a boring (yet still good) art style. The newest art style that only started in episode 521 is interesting. It basically is the worst art style when they are in a normal, bright setting but when the characters and objects etc. are shown in a dark area or there is some fun lighting like from a sunset or something, it looks pretty great.<br />
<br />
Sound: The music kinda fits what I said about this kinda being similar to actiona adventure shonen while still being a detective anime. The music fits the detective feel extremely well while also being like music you would expect in other anime. (the only way I explain it: you know how Naruto&#039;s background music often sounds like it fits a ninja anime? Well this fits a detective anime in the same way.)<br />
<br />
The voice acting is legendary. I can&#039;t overexagerate this. The major characters fit their roles so perfectly that to this day I truly can&#039;t imagine ANYONE else in the same role. (which I can&#039;t say about any other anime ever, quite honestly) This is especially true for Kogoro (Akira Kamiya) and Conan (Minami Takayama), whose voices are amazing and do such a perfect job at so many different emotions that I can&#039;t even describe how great they truly are.<br />
<br />
Character: The characters are infinitely fun. Everytime I see at least half of the recurring characters, I get a smile on my face. They are not ridiculously deep characters but they are always fun and they almost all have enjoyable personalities so I think it&#039;s awesome. You may not agree. Ok.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I have said how much I enjoyed throughout this review. It is honestly my favorite anime and even my favorite show ever. It has so much fun in it, without becoming too deep or too pointlessly complicated a series, which is just amazing and it made me enjoy an entire new genre, known as detective.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10.<br />
<br />

    Today I am going to be looking at a series that has been going strong since the 1990s with very little change in its art or storytelling. No, I&#039;m not talking about One Piece! I&#039;m talking about the OTHER anime that fits that description. Today, it is time to appreciate the sheer awesomeness of Detective Conan!<br />
<br />
<br />
Detective Conan is one of the longest running anime of all time as of 2015. Next year it celebrates 20 consecutive years without ever being taken off the air. What has been its secret to success? In order to understand this, it is important to realize just how much people

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186925">
        LOVE detective novels. Agatha Christie may not be James Joyce or Leo Tolstoy in terms of quality writing, but she has sold more books than either of them by a substantial margin. Detective Conan or &quot;Case Closed&quot; as it was called here in the US taps into that popularity and really hits that sweet spot.<br />
<br />
 The main character is the brilliant Shinichi Kudo, who aspires to be the next Sherlock Holmes. In addition to his razor sharp wits, he is also a star soccer player. Sort of like Sherlock Holmes and his boxing, a comparison made by Shinichi himself. His steady girlfriend is the ever short tempered tsundere Ran, who in the first episode shows her displeasure by punching a hole in a concrete wall! That&#039;s pretty damn beastly for a high school girl! When she isn&#039;t displaying feats of badassery, she is generally yelling at Shinichi for something or another. Unfortunately for Shinichi, 2 thugs knock him out and slip him an experimental drug that is supposed to kill him and rid the criminal underworld of its greatest threat. Fortunately for our hero, the drug only turns him into a kid. Now Shinichi with his new body must live under the alias Conan Edogawa and help Ran&#039;s idiotic father solve weekly murders by leading him around by the nose and doing all the work! Japan has a very low murder rate in real life, but in whatever world Detective Conan takes place in Japan makes Detroit look as boring as Finland. Conan has probably personally solved over 5,000 murders in his 20 year career. Sometimes Conan is joined by some other children and the tone feels very well...childish. However, a fairly disturbing and bloody murder will inevitably occur a few minutes later! This is a young demographic show where there is at least one graphic decapitation in the first episode! On a roller coaster no less! This is the king of cartoon weekly mystery shows, Scooby Doo be Scooby Damned. When this first came to the US around 2001, my little brother and I would stay up late to watch this every time it came on. We also developed a game where we took bets on whether or not the killer is the person with glasses. Seriously, in early episodes everyone with glasses besides Conan is a fucking murderer! I&#039;m surprised I don&#039;t run away whenever I see someone with glasses, thanks to watching too much Detective Conan as a kid!<br />
<br />
Sadly, I do have to admit that the art is pretty lousy and hasn&#039;t really kept up with the drastic improvement in animation quality for anime over the last 20 years. However, it remains charming and nostalgic and uses that in its favor. The music is generally pretty good with each of the first few openings and closings like Mune no Doki Doki being highly addictive and fun. Hell, I had the lyrics memorized in Japanese and would sing them in the shower!<br />
<br />
Overall, Detective Conan is a series that everyone should watch at least a few episodes of. The plot never really goes anywhere and Shinichi is probably never going to get his body back, marry Ran, or tell Kogoro what a stupid jackass he is, but people will keep watching anyways. It is simple, formulaic fun at its best and if you like mysteries and detective fiction than this one will probably be a blast! I award Detective Conan a well deserved 8/10

    Shinichi Kudo(Jimmy Kudo) is highly famous for being the best teen detective of East Japan. His knowledge on mystery novels &amp; soccer skills has made him a modern Sherlock Holmes. And has helped out the police on the toughest cases. Life was going smooth with Shinichi. On one night however, he was at the wrong place at the wrong time. Where 2 men in black clothes were about to get their cover blown by Shinichi. One of them knocked him out cold and forced a poison pill that was meant to end his life. However instead of killing him. It made him shrink from a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review13392">
        teen to a kid.<br />
<br />
Still have the brains of a sleuth, but no longer in the full grown body of Japan&#039;s favorite teen detective. Shinichi had to go under the alias of Conan Edogawa. A combination of 2 of his favorite mystery novelists. And can&#039;t reveal his real identity, as it&#039;ll endanger the people he knows and will get chased by the 2 men in black who&#039;ll come to finish the job. Shinichi now lives with his friend Ran(Rachel) who is the daughter of third rate detective Kogoru Mohri(Richard Moore). Pretending to be a smart ordinary kid, Conan uses the gadgets provided by his Mad next door scientist, Dr. Asawa. To help him solve the crimes and help Kogoru out without being noticed. Conan hopes to make Kogoru famous so that way he can get some leads and info on the 2 men responsible for his condition.<br />
<br />
As the series progresses, Conan does what he can to become Shinichi Kudo again. And will encounter many cases on Homocide, Suicide, Robbery, Child abduction, salvage, &amp; terrorism. Once he does find the 2 men in black, Conan will try to obtain the pill that changed him and get Dr. Asawa to make an antidote to make him Shinichi again.<br />
<br />
For more than a decade this anime has been widely successful in Japan. And an international hit in many countries. I never heard of it till 2005. And very surprised to learn how long this series is. With almost 500 episodes, several movies, and a handful of OVAs. Detective Conan(Case Closed) should deserve to be a highly acclaim cartoon in any category for Anime.<br />
<br />
Problem is very few American Anime fans, don&#039;t know how great it is or don&#039;t know it&#039;s existence. If you like Anime with action, comedy, mystery, or just something that&#039;ll keep you busy. I guaranteed Detective Conan is unlike the other mystery anime out there.<br />

    If you aren&#039;t into extremely long series then stop now because when this review was written there were nearly 798 episodes and 19 movies to the series. However, if you&#039;re okay with long series that have quite a bit of a repeat in patterns than you&#039;ll be just fine.<br />

Detective Conan is about an High School Ace Detective that was well-known for solving cases but one day he &quot;up and vanished&quot; only to be replaced by a pint-sized shrimp known as Conan Edogawa. He stays with a family friend, Mouri Kogoro, who was a detective as well but unfortunately not so well-known...<br />
<br />
Time ticks on... Conan digging

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204166">
        for information on the &quot;Black Organization&quot; while solving crimes, yadaa yadaa yadaa. If you&#039;re into something with a bit of drama, some comical moment, and problem solving this may be for you. Now, I&#039;ve been watching the series since the summer of 2005 but fell so behind that I&#039;m seriously playing catch up and binge watching when I get the time to... but because there are nearly 800 episodes, that it is still ongoing with no announcement of stopping anytime soon, and there is a 20th movie due out in Japan around Spring time this may not be something you&#039;ll want to dive in head first to.<br />
<br />
Oh, and ignore the artwork of the first 6 seasons as it gets way better with time. That is one other thing I&#039;ve noticed over time is that the art styling changed a bit. Nothing drastic, just clearer I guess? Anyways, hope this review proved to be useful to some. ;D

    Warning: Inconsequential Spoilers<br />
<br />
Detective Conan is a hard series to review because with 500+ episodes, anything one might say about it can be disputed. If you expect a show that reveals itself to you in a timely manner you may as well look somewhere else, this show is composed almost exclusively of episodic and semi-episodic mysteries. <br />
<br />
You&#039;ll come to the table with a few expectations and if your viewing hinges on them you will be displeased. The tension between Ran and Shinichi will probably never be fully played out. The mysteries of the Black Organization probably will be played out, but they are in no hurry.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review18376">
        We can only hope they do something climactic with Kaito Kid.<br />
<br />
It is a worthwhile show for the right person. DC rewards patience more than anything else, introducing characters at a leisurely pace, but always making use of them in an almost miraculous manner. You&#039;ll be shocked the first time you meet Hattori Heiji (spoiler: the first person to figure out who Conan really is), and delighted when you meet his not-girlfriend, Kazuha. When Conan goes to other regions of Japan we meet new police inspectors and when they go back, they&#039;re still there.<br />
<br />
This is how Detective Conan keeps an edge despite being highly episodic; aside from the suspects, characters you meet are seldom one-shot appearances. The show builds up a vast array of returning characters to delight the audience with.<br />
<br />
The animation is a mixed bag. Having been in production for more than 10 years, the quality and techniques have undergone changes for better and worse. <br />
<br />
The music is high quality, but with the magnitude of episodes, some of it gets repetitive.<br />
<br />
Now, the goods:<br />
<br />
If you learn to appreciate the wonderful cast and the mysteries, your previous expectations will be addressed in occasional installments throughout the course of the series. From time to time you&#039;ll be given an hour episode, a two-hour episode, or handful of half-hour episodes pertaining to Kaito Kid, the Black Organization, Shinichi&#039;s (Conan&#039;s) struggles to maintain his relationship with Ran, or a combination of these. This is where the show truly shines... some of these story-arcs are contenders with the best series around. In these episodes, the people behind the show flex their muscles for mystery in a different way - instead of creating a complex crime, they figure out ingenious ways to trick the audience, pulling off magnificent stunts that seem improbable until they reveal all the details that had been staring you in the face. These core story episodes are inspired works of intrigue and cognitive fanservice.<br />
<br />
Nothing about Detective Conan is predictable except that we&#039;ll be waiting a LONG time for the real answers. Please watch if you have the patience... it WILL be rewarded.

    Meitantei Shouichi Kudo (17 years) goes out with his highschool sweetheart Ran Mouri while he accidently bump into a secret black coats suspicious bloodthirsty guys, who force him to swallow a prototype drug (considering it&#039;s highly lethal).<br />
Luckily, that drug didn&#039;t kill, but made him shrinked into an elementary school boy, with the same mind, hiding from the gangs under the name (Conan Edogawa)<br />
while he&#039;s forced to lie infront of his highschool sweatheart, he blend-in with her father (Kougoro Mouri)&#039;s Detective Agency, considering they may bump into the same gang.<br />
<br />
Each episode has it&#039;s funny moments that makes me laugh out loud, especially Kougoro Mouri&#039;s funny acts

          <span style="display: none;" id="review55949">
        and temper problems, while conan usually makes a joke about Kougoro&#039;s foolishness.On the other side, there is also the conan (shrinked shouichi) with Ran&#039;s special drama romance collusion side-stories that made me really emotional sometimes.<br />
<br />
In addition, nearly each year or two, there&#039;s a few episodes about the mysterious gangs, but so far, nothing tangible or useful. will Conan ever return back to Shouichi Kudo and confess to Ran Mouri his love? Can he ever punish those who tried to always kill him?<br />
<br />
One thing I must admit; as much as I watch is as long as I want more and more episodes and I&#039;m glad it hasn&#039;t finished yet so far !

    Ah...Detective Conan..one of the longest running anime series...<br />
I was browsing through anime episodes when I encountered this anime in some 700-s episodes. I thought &quot;How the hell can something be running for 700 episodes and still be going strong??&quot;(One Piece had not reached 700 episodes then and I didn&#039;t know about Sazae -san) When I watched the first episode, I knew why. It&#039;s one of the most logic-applying anime out there. Sure, I&#039;ve watched Death Note, but Detective Conan does not have any supernatural beings or things. Also, Conan/Shinichi solves most of the cases on the scene itself.<br />
But enough. On the story now. Shinichi Kudo

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204692">
        is a highschool detective who helps the Japanese Police solve difficult cases. He and his childhood friend,Ran Mouri, go out to an Entertainment Park where Shinichi observes a suspicious deal taking place between two men one of whom he had encountered earlier but his partner knocks Shinichi out from behind and gives him a drug which turns him to a child. Shinichi then ends up staying with Ran and her detective father Kogoro Mouri. Whenever a case arrives, he knocks him out with a watch containing a tranquilizer dart and solves the case, changing his voice to Kogoro&#039;s and solving the case, thus giving Kogoro the name, &quot;Sleeping Kogoro&quot;. <br />
You might think, &quot;What&#039;s interesting in that??&quot; But the fact is that Detective Conan is a very good anime and Conan always solves his cases using sound logic and astute observations. You will not find him lacking in the logic department. The thing I like the most is that all the clues are presented to the viewers and even we can solve the case. We just have to think out the scenario. We also meet new characters, who have a much larger impact on the plot than you even anticipated. <br />
Then there is the Black Organization. They are an organization shrouded in mystery and also the main villains of the story who gave Conan the drug and <br />
whom he is hunting. Their objective is yet to be clear.<br />
The main thing that turns people away are the sheer number of episodes. The thing is that in the starting the writers focused more on the cases than the plot. That is why the Black Organization appear in the first episode and then are not seen for an whole season. That is why I recommend patience while watching Detective Conan from the starting. There is also some comedy thrown in, but never in excess, to lighten the mood.<br />
The only thing is, if you&#039;re watching it from the start on internet, make intermediate pauses in between so that you don&#039;t get bored case after case.<br />
There is also some romance in it, which makes it interesting.<br />
The character development is also a good factor.(which we must see, now that it has reached 800 episodes+)<br />
The last thing is (as a personal opinion), that Detective Conan is for logical people like me and it may turn out to be turnoff for people who love romance or people who like plots to move forward quickly. <br />
{MINOR SPOILERS}<br />
But there is the point that you can&#039;t ignore the cases of Kaitou Kid, Hattori Heiji , and specially, the black organization.<br />
{SPOILERS END HERE} <br />
In all, Detective Conan is a must watch for people who liked the logical part of animes such as Death Note.<br />

    Okay so most of you must have heard this anime before, no, every one of you must have heard this anime before. But let’s hear a review from someone not an expert, but a huge fan on this matter.<br />
<br />
So Detective Conan is an anime unlike any other. It tells the story about Kudou Shinichi a 17 year old detective whose parents are: a detective novel writer and a retired actress.  He goes out with his best friend, Mouri Ran, to a theme park and while they were there he spotted some men making an illegal deal. But before he could do anything about it,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review76077">
        one of the men hit him behind his back and gave him a weird drug that changed him into a kid and has turned him into whom we all currently know as Edogawa Conan. His friend Ran took custody of him with the help of his detective father, Mouri Kogoro. And ever since then, his life has had numerous turnabouts while continuing his profession under the shadow of Kogoro. <br />
<br />
Now let’s begin<br />
Plot: 10<br />
So, as I’ve said, Detective Conan is an anime series unlike any other. The story is unique and has a great sense of expertise that no one has ever tied it up with. I’m sure making a detective show isn’t that easy that’s why it’s so different since no one can make it the way Detective Conan has. The plot in one episode then the killing process and how to prove it is no laughing matter. Aoyama Gosho is one person you wouldn’t want to mess with because I’m pretty sure that if you even try offend him, he must have thousands of ideas he can use in trying to kill you. Detective Conan sure is something worth watching and as soon as Shinichi turns back into his old self I bet everyone would want to ask these questions: When and How. <br />
<br />
Characters: 10<br />
Now what’s great about the characters is that they somehow solve crimes along with Shinichi/Conan. They all have a reason for being there and their coincidences are something you wouldn’t want to judge. The characters have a wide range from detective children to a butt-kicking best friend and a famous detective that seems to solve each crime whenever he falls asleep and that nobody seems to question. Each character has shown extreme usefulness in solving the main plot of the anime and their intelligence may sometimes be overwhelming we all know one thing from them: They always solve the crime before we do. <br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
Okay, so most of you might have criticized one important point in the art of each character: the ears. I know that they are somehow extremely huge even for a fictional character but maybe it’s their way of making people remember them; “What anime has the biggest ears?” “Detective Conan” or something like that. Anyway, in my opinion I liked Detective Conan better when it was during the late 90s since well, it’s grown to me, but now that they have evolved into something where the colors are brighter I don’t really mind either. Detective Conan has a lot of flaws when it comes to their drawing style not the way Naruto or Bleach is but maybe that’s what makes it so unique. <br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
Well, Detective Conan doesn’t have a lot of sounds except when their trying to figure out a mystery or when Conan/Shinichi solves it in his head but it doesn’t really matter. For me, in a suspense or mystery show sound isn’t that important whereas the story is what you’re really looking out for. I’m not saying that sound isn’t a crucial element, it is, but for an element you don’t really notice since you’re too busy trying to solve something well, in this case it isn’t as much as any other anime genre there is. <br />
<br />
So, my overall rating for Detective Conan is 10 mostly because I’m a person who loves watching detective shows and because, well it’s basically unique. If you go looking for an anime who’s making your mind blow up with numerous questions until it’s solved or just trying to check how good you are as a detective or a private eye or even if you want to try to kill a person but you don’t want it to be solved by a bunch of idiotic ‘detectives’ then this is the show for you. It gets you on your feet pacing, makes you sit at the edge of your seat and floods your brain with different ways to commit a crime then people, what are you waiting for? The show has been on air since 1996 and has solves more than 600 mysteries I think that’s proof enough why this show is something you should watch. <br />

    I’d just like to start this review stating that Detective Conan is mainly a series for lovers of the mystery/Detective genre. While it does have a very compelling overarching plot, some great comedy, characters, music and other mechanics that I will be mentioning later on; the series has a main focus on the many cases that it has and I do feel like anyone not completely locked in and trying to solve the various cases through the episodes… won’t be able to appreciate the series as much as those that do. Now, that being said, Detective Conan is a brilliant long running anime &amp; manga

          <span style="display: none;" id="review210653">
        series with one of the best longer overarching plots in any anime with great character progression, some brilliantly laid out cases and a very nice “journey” feel to it as you progress through the series and I’d urge anyone considering taking on the anime not to feel intimidated by the episode count, it is something that can be watched with a few episodes at a time without really losing any of the flow with the exception of the arcs involving the main antagonists.<br />
<br />
Story: [Short synopsis – second paragraph more “reviewey”] Kudo Shinichi, a genius highschool Detective is on a date with childhood friend Mouri Ran and discovers an illicit deal underway, he gets caught unawares and is forced to take a pill that, unbeknownst to the assailants shrinks his body to a childhood state. He rushes to his house to regroup and bumps into Ran who is looking for him, when asked what his name is he looks at the books in his family library and comes up with the alias (Arthur) Conan Edogawa (Rampo), it then occurs to him that he should live with Ran whose father is a failing private detective and, from the background, solve enough cases to the point where he may investigate the “black organisation” that shrunk his body. The story of Detective Conan encompasses a slowly overarching plotline as Conan zeroes in on this black organisation, gathers allies along the way and struggles to keep up relationships with the friends of Kudo Shinichi, it is a plot that will keep you on your toes and so incredibly engaged through this long journey.<br />
<br />
From the above synopsis you can probably already tell that the story is quite an involved one, lots of organisations and characters get involved, the old fashioned Detective chase is at the heart of the story and Detective Conan does take an undercover operation to the next level. While the anime is very episodic like most Detective TV shows and other anime I do think that this overarching plot is one of the best out there and some of the twists that Conan has thought out months beforehand do have quite the shock value and keep you very engaged during those arcs.<br />
<br />
The art in detective Conan is quite controversial because it is quite a unique and quirky style, while the art does change through the series as Gosho changes his style and gets better at drawing (and the animation follows through) it is quite an old art style which might not be everyone’s cup of tea. One thing that I do find is done quite well though are the action scenes, Conan will take down a culprit using the many gadgets at his disposal and I do find that they animate movement quite well which is highlighted in the many movies. Scenery is also done very nicely, as a tie in with the humour in the anime the many facial expressions can also be quite hilarious.<br />
<br />
Music: I do think that the Detective Conan anime does music and soundtracks very well, the original main theme has a very “jazzy” feel to it with the Sax which was quite prominent in the 1920s which also happens to be when EDOGAWA Ranpo started publishing his first books. Conan has a very old style of using soundtracks in it is very uniformal use of a song for each character/event which again isn’t seen as often in the later episodes and I do think that for the Detective Conan series it does it justice, from the very upbeat soundtrack that we see when Conan is chasing a culprit or about to reveal one to the slower and sadder songs we see when Shinichi reluctantly keeps Ran at bay… the soundtrack does very well to set the mood.<br />
<br />
Character: The vast cast in Detective Conan do very well to make it such an engaging show and we see considerable character progression despite the short timespan (not episode span) of the show. It is mainly the exposure to the crimes that young children and teenagers wouldn’t usually be exposed to that would explain most of the progression that we see but Gosho does like his romantic stories so we see quite obvious pairings develop over time. Another thing that the characters do quite well in is the relationships and pairings that we see in the anime, most of the time they are there for some very funny moments but I think that the mutual… agreements, the lack of need to really communicate between several characters is something that just gives you a good feeling about the anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Personally I have thoroughly enjoyed the ride that Detective Conan has and continues to take me on, the starvation that you go through of the main overarching plot makes the “Black Organisation” episodes all the better and I think that just spending time getting to know the characters, guessing who the culprit may be and just having a laugh at how Conan manages to get around a crime scene and solve the case without anyone being the wiser.  Detective Conan has a brilliant enjoyment value privy to all of its fans over the years, it really does have something for everyone for all ages and I do believe for all the criticism that the story gets because of its episodic nature and characters that aren’t quite as popular to some fans, it has enough of a variety to satisfy I believe anyone that gives it a real shot.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: To conclude I’d just like to reiterate that the anime has more of a focus on the cases and crime rather than the overarching plot and character relationships that the story is known for and I’d suggest that anyone planning on taking on the series has a keen love for mystery. Not without its faults, Gosho Aoyama does incorporate the close network of friends and enemies with their problems and deficits in a crime saturated Japan quite well and the anime’s long run is a bit of a testimony to the fact. I have personally really loved the story and do not think that Detective Conan gets the credit it deserves with its predominately Japanese fanbase despite an initially bad reception in the US when it started airing with English names and dubs. I’d just like to urge everyone to at least give this series a go, who knows? You could be a closet mystery lover yourself!<br />

    There is only one truth!<br />
<br />
Detective Conan also known as Case Closed is one of those anime series you just watch episodes in one sitting it&#039;s like you watch 20 episodes in one day. It&#039;s also series that have certain popularity because cases and plot are working well together and it just so interesting and you get to also think those right choices that characters make in the anime. So it&#039;s really like brainwork for you at the sametime.<br />
<br />
(Story)<br />
<br />
This story is very touching indeed and you can relate to Conan&#039;s story in this one and it&#039;s also pretty interesting story that you just want to get

          <span style="display: none;" id="review80084">
        more of it when you had start watching this. Also story has some dark moments in it. But it&#039;s definitely one of the best detective stories. <br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
<br />
(Animation)<br />
<br />
Even though animation is very old and looking bad. After a couple of episode it really begins to fit in the series and you just begin love those nice environments  that they offer.  <br />
<br />
Animation: 9/10<br />
<br />
(Music)<br />
<br />
I always liked DC because of it music selection it has to offer like main theme of this is just awesome saxophone playing out and little bit 80&#039;s music. Also there is different music in different scenes. What I mean that this anime has all characters different music and same goes for places and themes.  Also OP and ED are going to get some mention here. Those both are really enjoyable and listening this song over and over it&#039;s fun. And I am sure everyone can find at least one of the music track they like. So that&#039;s why this anime&#039;s music selection is one of the best selections I&#039;ve seen in the anime series.<br />
<br />
Music: 10/10<br />
<br />
(Characters)<br />
<br />
Gosho have created so many characters in the series so it&#039;s just amazing how he can manage so many different characters. But there seems to be at least one problem in these characters. They don&#039;t get much develop time in the series like maybe Conan and Haibara only get&#039;s it but for example Mitsuhiko, Genta and Ayumi don&#039;t get it at all. Also there is so many variety of characters that it&#039;s just incredible.<br />
<br />
Characters: 10/10<br />
<br />
(Enjoyment)<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed the series. I remember starting this series myself in 2010 from episode 1 and now we are in 2012 almost 2013 and I have watched like 674 episodes so I really like this series. Also every time I am watching it I am so focused so I don&#039;t hear anything else.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
<br />
(Overall)<br />
<br />
Detective Conan is one of the best detective anime&#039;s ever made. It&#039;s has offer everything on it. Sadness, Happiness, Funny comedy scenes and critical moments. It has also very good point what could happen if you make wrong choices  and they explain that really well. I definitely recommend this series all detective and mystery fans and also of course others who wanna get anime which includes everything on it. And experience something that they never haven&#039;t experienced.<br />
<br />
My Overall final score for his awesome anime is:<br />
<br />
10/10<br />
<br />

    Aye, this is my first review.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re an anime fan i&#039;m sure you&#039;ve heard of a series named Detective Conan before. It was created by Gosho Aoyama in 1994 and got an anime adaption in 1996. Surprisingly, for not being talked about much here in the west this series got me hooked on the first episode but there are a flaws. Keep in mind, YOU DONT HAVE TO WATCH EVERY EPISODE. Im sure its common knowledge by now but long running anime tend to have filler, this is skippable, and in this case most of the canon episodes are skippable because they dont offer to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330061">
        the main story for the most part. You can use XerBlade&#039;s detective conan guide if you want to skip some stuff but if you do, id reccomend going back and watching episodes you skipped just like I did.<br />
<br />
Story: 6/10<br />
A very gripping story about a teenage detective named Shinichi Kudo, one day he comes across men in black and is knocked out and turned into a kid again, they are later called the &quot;Black Organization&quot;. The problem here is that it barely progresses and when it does it only happens about 2-3 times every 100 episodes but seeing Conan try and keep his identity a secret is always fun to see, each case is very enjoyable and creative. The manga author even experiments these cases in real life to see if they work, very passionate author!<br />
<br />
Art: 5/10 Animation: 6/10<br />
The art is really nice in the first few 100 episodes but over time it slowly changes and becomes very sharp. The noses start to curve and it looks very weird/ugly at times but it is not a deal breaker. The animation is pretty solid within the first 100 episodes or so but after the series went HD you will notice how inconsistent the quality is.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
Amazing voice actors. Conan/Shinichi&#039;s role is extremely iconic and we even have Megumi Hayashibara (Rei Ayanami from Neon Genesis Evangelion) playing as one of the main characters. In each case, the VA&#039;s manage to convey a lot of emotion, it gets me every time. Now theres something else I forgot to mention, the MUSIC. The music is some sort of jazz music but it is great and iconic as well. Go on youtube and play conan&#039;s main theme, im sure you&#039;ve heard it before. For some reason they decided to stop using the old OST&#039;s in recent episodes and lets just say the new OST doesnt really hold a candle to the old one but its whatever.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8/10<br />
Detective Conan provides us with a wide variety of characters scaling from criminals to civilians to police officers and FBI agents. Although there are a lot, each of them are interesting on their own way and Aoyama makes it so these characters don&#039;t feel the same.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6/10 <br />
Detective Conan is mostly episodic and is mainly filler but as I said before, each case is very enjoyable but it gets repetitive at times and you can find yourself waiting around 70 episodes for some main story stuff. This series&#039; arcs consist of something like this: 1) Conan comes across a case 2) Black Organization progression 3) Love arcs (develops on 2 characters and their love for each other). While each of these arcs are usually good, the Black Organization arcs take the cake. It is mainly a clash between Conan and the Black Organization, these arcs never fail in the action and suspense department and I still look forward to them each time I watch this show.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7/10<br />
I completely recommend this series to everyone. Yes, it&#039;s long but its worth it. The only flaws are that it can drag on a lot but this isn&#039;t really a problem because the main story arcs can get you HYPE and I mean HYPE, Gosho Aoyama is a heavily underrated genius. Check this out.<br />
<br />
EDIT: MENTIONED MUSIC AND ANIMATION

    Well, I am new to writing reviews, and would highly appreciate if some one could suggest on how to improve it.<br />
Have u ever heard &quot; the fruit of patience is always sweet&quot;, then Dc( Detective Conan) is the best example for that.<br />
For most people dragon ballz/naruto was their first anime and marked their entrance into the anime , but for me it was this epic anime Detective Conan.<br />
Dc is largely an episodic anime. It has 700+ eps! to make it the longest ongoing anime with 23 min for each ep. ( and some 1 hour, 1.5, 3 hour long specials). But it also has it&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review132625">
        main story progressing slowly (very slowly). That said it is must watch for any Sherlock Holmes fan, or anyone who likes the mystery genre. <br />
<br />
Note: I wanted to keep spoilers to minimum, but without small spoilers, most viewers would drop it by ep 30. So I am spoiling only a bit, rest assured it will in no way disrupt the flow of the anime, nor will diminish a viwer&#039;s interest. <br />
<br />
There are mainly 5 types of episodes that will keep you glued to the anime<br />
1. Cases which are 3 episodes long ( though these have special settings, but are quite interesting to watch)<br />
2. Cases in which Kaitou Kid appears ( first introduced in ep 75)<br />
3. Cases in which Hattori Heiji appears (first introduced in ep 48).<br />
4. Cases in which Kudou Shinichi appears in adult form.<br />
5. And finally, the best of best, the cases involving the Black Organisation.<br />
<br />
All, the 5 types I mentioned above earsn Dc my full respect, and imo, the epicness involved in type 5 eps surpass even the epicness of naruto or bleach.<br />
The best part about Dc is that supernatural element is kept to a minimum, ( ideally should be zero, but the fact that Conan is present at the time of case is itself supernatural). This sharpens the mystery element and draws its full potential. <br />
There are occasional bits romance involved, like ran x shinichi, and metropolitan police love story, etc., for people who like it.<br />
<br />
The main complaint with Dc is that given the large number of eps, a few cases become repetitive. though I say repetitive it is at most the motive or setting, or way of murder ( any one at anime and not all 3 together). <br />
Also it is too slow. For eg. one of the main characters is introduced in ep 129. It&#039;s just too long. Even then it is worth the time spent.<br />
Moreover (as u must have guessed) it has many fillers. And a main problem with many cases is the existence of dying messages, which sometimes ruin the case for non Japanese people ( like me) who can&#039;t read them and thus can&#039;t even try to decipher them.<br />
Another problem with Dc is that Conan is a kid, and naturally his friends are also kids, and some episodes which focus on them feel childish unless the case actually happens and Conan investigates independently.<br />
And the final problem is that will the anime ever end? But rest assured, the author has said that he has already planned its ending, ( and it&#039;s supposed to be epic).<br />
<br />
 So finally, having laid out the pros and cons, I still feel that Dc is a must watch, because the feel of the epic showdowns after 50-60, sometimes even 100 eps is a sensation I can&#039;t explain in words.<br />
For those who have dropped the anime,I would recommend u guys to pick it up as the latest developments are must watch. <br />
Lastly, <br />
Art 8/10<br />
Sound 8/10<br />
Story 10/10 ( if u take out the fillers) <br />
           9/10 (with fillers)<br />
Characters 9/10 ( not too incredible, not too shabby)<br />
