::FULL REVIEW::<br />
People always try to be above others. It&#039;s because they can&#039;t be happy unless they have people below them. This show creates a whole universe around this concept and other unconventional ideals. From the anime description and genre choices for this show, and even the database picture the normal

          <span style="display: none;" id="review7826">
        anime viewer might be a little turned off from this show. At first glance for me I quickly turned it away as I thought it was aimed toward children. Despite showing an R+ rating I also notice ratings are usually 20% correct in the MAL database. <br />
<br />
But after pushing it aside for about two weeks, I finally decided to give it a shot and boy will you be surprised. Right off the start, you&#039;re heart will start racing as you follow the story of the main character. A after waking up from a daze, blade runner &#039;esque chase quickly follows. After the action, the main character appears to be very lost, which I&#039;m sure most of you will feel the same way he does. This also starts a unique connection and experience between the viewer and the main character. This is where the show really starts. <br />
<br />
One thing I&#039;m sure most people will notice is the art style. You will either love it or hate it but don&#039;t let the artwork turn you away from this show. After an episode or two you will most likely appreciate the level of originality this art style brings to the plate. After i have seen over 100+ series in a three month span, this was a very welcome change to the orthodox anime styles. Dont let the simple look fool you as well, there are more than enough small details to pay attention to throughout. From the tiny memory pellets to an overcrowded storage room. Everything looks very thought out and amazing. Often you&#039;ll probably think to yourself, how the hell does Misaaki and Nobutaka make this ***t up?<br />
<br />
Another false assumption was that the characters were mostly children since they have a simple child like look to them. But they are very much mature adults. The characters are are all so very likable and I owe a lot of that to the art style and the small details that they do or don&#039;t leave out. The even greater point is how Masaaki Yuasa goes to great depths to control the viewers emotions with the use of these characters. One minute, you&#039;ll hate a character, then the next you&#039;ll feel sorry for them, then you&#039;ll feel frustrated because this is almost an emotional roller coaster. Rest assured, this is a good kind of frustration (if there is such a thing). <br />
<br />
Defintiely &amp;quot;don&#039;t judge this book by its cover.&amp;quot; This point of view story was rather an interesting one and the science, technology, and hierarchy surrounding this universe was very captivating experience. There are quite a large number of allusions and ideals in every episode that got me reflecting on what I have just experienced (which I absolutely love).  I can&#039;t really compare this to any other anime show. If i had to compare the story to something, it like a telling of a blade runner/ matrix story in the eyes of Dr. Seuss. <br />
<br />
A great way to close this epic show would be a quote from Dr. Seuss&#039; Yertle the Turtle:<br />
&amp;quot;You hush your mouth!&amp;quot; Howled the Mighty King Yertle.<br />
&amp;quot;You have no right to talk to the world&#039;s highest turtle.<br />
&amp;quot;I rule from the clouds, over land, over sea!<br />
There is no nothing, NOTHING, that&#039;s higher than me!&amp;quot;

    Kaiba is a dystopian/cyberpunk anime. The atypical story telling and mesmerizing dystopias which are always complemented with vivid and unique artwork of the highest degree make for a highly enjoyable experience for myself. By no means do I consider these to be  flawless genres but the amalgamation of the many tropes from these genres creates a captivating experience I personally can’t really find in other genre(s), so on that fact this review may be a little bias. One could argue that Kaiba itself is not a cyberpunk series but a dystopian fantasy and I could agree with that, and maybe that is why I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180135">
        consider it a cut above the rest of the cyberpunk (GitS and Texhnolyze  for instance) I&#039;ve watched. It is something fresh and has a totally different approach and perspective. However I do still feel it does share many similarities that cyberpunk does, so I will still refer to it as such.<br />
<br />
Like any other cyberpunk and dystopian anime it is apparent from the inception that it is a society that has been totally dehumanized. In this case, to handheld chips and yellow blobs. Bodies are thrown away like old clothing and replaced on mere whims. Human life and emotion is &quot;seemingly&quot; disregarded. Which is generally the most common criticism, and maybe even point, of these genres. They lack any real empathy and it is understandable that this can deter viewers from the genre. However, this is where Kaiba truly shines. Kaiba puts the futuristic technology into a more human context and is the reason why I emphasize the word seemingly. It is an empathetic cyberpunk, that is to say, that characters express true emotions and warmth. Which is something these series generally lack (for better or for worse? that’s each person&#039;s decision). It shows this empathy whilst at the same time, it is able to show the total loss of human value. To be able to show both polar opposites of this spectrum without one impacting the other is a true testament to how well done this series is.<br />
<br />
The empathy is shown in many cases throughout the series, such as maternal bonds, but most notably through the two main characters that, despite not remembering each other, and being in totally different bodies, they are still drawn together and attracted to one another. It also shows the sacrifices one is willing to take to stay with their loved ones and no amount of deceit and lies will stand between characters coming together. And at heart, this really is a series about human longing and romance.<br />
<br />
Similarly, the OST completely compliments and helps illustrate both the dystopian nature of the world in which Kaiba is set and also its warm empathetic side. Most notably two pieces: the  Melody of Clonico and The Tree Song. The Melody of Clonico (episode 3) really serves to illustrate the empathetic side of the series. The Tree Song holds magnificent symbolism in both a literal and metaphorical sense, and it is no surprise why this song is teased throughout the entire series becoming its ‘staple’ piece. While this may not be relevant to some, it is something I can wholeheartedly appreciate. This song illustrates the entire series as a whole in more than one way.<br />
<br />
Kaiba&#039;s characters are fantastic for the most part. A large portion of the series can be considered episodic, meaning, Kaiba travels from one place to another and in doing so meets characters along the way that don&#039;t stay relevant for very long but they do what&#039;s required of them and are well developed enough in most cases that you genuinely care about them and what happens to them. Kaiba is a very interesting and mysterious character that at the beginning, the viewer knows as much (or as little) as Kaiba himself, who has lost his memories. As the series progresses Kaiba - and the viewer - learn more about his past which made it a very engaging experience as he slowly becomes more aware of the girl in his locket. That girl being Neiro. Neiro is also a very interesting character, who, without spoiling much, has issues of her own in regards to her memories. The most rewarding thing about the characters, namely Kaiba - but also others - is that his genuine interactions with other characters within the series brings a sense of warmth to an otherwise, overly cold and dark society.<br />
<br />
The art is a love or hate relationship. It is far from mainstream and maybe even pretentious. There&#039;s not much to say about that, the animation is still fluid, the characters are still well designed and the world they find themselves in is equally well designed. I personally found it to be one of the series greatest strengths and made it an even more rewarding watch.<br />
<br />
Kaiba is a bag of mixed emotions, on one hand it is incredibly sad to watch as human life is literally thrown away and treated like garbage, but on the other hand it is beautifully warm to see individuals stop at nothing to preserve this life and connect with their loved ones. It left me not knowing what to feel at times and I can only say that as absolute praise for the series. I am not saying this series is for everyone, it is totally understandable that if you’re not a fan of cyberpunk/dystopian anime this may not be for you, but if you don’t like these genres for the lack of empathy they portray, this may pleasantly surprise you. There are other reasons why this isn&#039;t for everyone, most notably, its art which as I said, is far from the mainstream. It may not be an easy watch for some, especially given the cyberpunk/dystopian tropes it has, but it is something I loved wholeheartedly.<br />
<br />
Thanks for taking the time to read.<br />

    Where there is a body, there is a mind. A mind that is unquestionably a part of us and remains to be this way until our eventual passing. Throughout the centuries of philosophy and science, it is one of the most utterly fascinating aspects of human existence that has yet to be explored fully. There have been many stories that have delved into the realm of consciousness as the primary plot device from the mid-20th-century science fiction authors, and anime has had its fair share of shows that are akin to this. One of which is Kaiba, a fascinating trip that shows no boundaries of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review135857">
        animation and how it can use different styles in anime that have primarily been redundant at the time.<br />
<br />
It is true that this type of story has not been done before. One that deals with the concept of minds and how it&#039;s our self, but with Kaiba, it&#039;s like a journey you go through with our main hero, named Kaiba. He meets different characters from his trip that all have distinct characteristics that make them stick out from the rest, who may or may not help him in his search to find his memories that have been lost after his long slumber. As we follow our likable hero, we discover how the world that Kaiba inhabits has begun to crumble under its dystopia. Although they portray the setting in a surrealist manner to give it a distinctive look, there&#039;s still the lack of any depth to the world itself. In other words, there&#039;s not enough to go around from the lack of exposition it gives to the history of this world that Kaiba has to offer, and it only succeeds halfheartedly.<br />
<br />
With that said, even though the plot features some mind-bending, philosophical facets that incorporate Kaiba, the story-telling that helps guide them through the narrative is somewhat lacking. Nonetheless, when the show starts, it manages to make an excellent first impression in showing us first-hand what the world is like and how the other people who live in it go through the absolute turmoil that plagues their way of life. Some moments were even strong enough to invoke tears from my eyes. However, it doesn&#039;t take long until we cut away from the protagonist and then start going into the character back story of another named Chroniko. To explain this clearly, Kaiba implants his memories into Chroniko, and from then on we get to explore Chroniko&#039;s past and how she was brought up into the world. While this might seem admirable to make us know that there are, in fact, more than just Kaiba that might matter, I feel as though it wasn&#039;t even needed in the first place when we already have to follow Kaiba and his journey to get his memories back, even though technically he&#039;s inside of Chroniko in these scenes.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, we follow other characters such as the sheriff, named Vanilla, and his fascination with Chroniko, or in this case, the body that Kaiba inhabits. This plays off more like a desperate attempt to make the show longer. After that, we discourage entirely that whole moment that involved both of those characters, and we follow Kaiba like nothing ever happened previously. One could say that those plot arcs were necessary for Kaiba to understand the meaning of human emotion and the human condition, but it comes across as a bit trite and forgettable once the next episode rolls in.<br />
<br />
Although with that said, the conclusion to the story felt incredibly fulfilling to experience after a brilliant romantic setup between Kaiba and Neiro, who play off each other very well. Their immediate feelings for each other might seem a little cliched, but how they direct the dialogue they say to each other comes off rather fluently and feels genuine. Right near the very last frame of the previous episode, it felt like the best way to give Kaiba a sense of closure.<br />
<br />
By far the most alluring aspect of Kaiba that has made it somewhat of an indistinguishable show amongst the anime community is the art and animation. Directed by Masaaki Yuasa, who also directed the classic The Tatami Galaxy and directed the animation and wrote the surrealist film Cat Soup, this man knows his way of transforming his visions into reality and making us clamor for more of his artistic creativity. Kaiba&#039;s hook from its animation relies not just on an unconventional art style, but also its seamless implementation to the story and tone it tries to convey to us. Once we see the art style which Yuasa executes on constructing Kaiba&#039;s world, the result is no less than jaw-dropping. In some areas, it might seem even a little forceful in the attempts of making things a little too wacky and cartoony, the moments where it shows how people can invade someone&#039;s memories look incredible at face value.<br />
<br />
The fluid motions that the characters exhibit in the show&#039;s animation feel reminiscent of western-influence and the works of the great Osamu Tezuka. The abstract shapes of the buildings and vehicles give the show its unique identity and ultimately becomes very memorable in that aspect. There is about as much creativity as one could get from a studio named Madhouse, who&#039;s no stranger to producing shows similar in nature of Kaiba.<br />
<br />
On the overall quality of the sound production, the voice acting is serviceable with the veteran voice actresses Romi Park and Mamiko Noto giving out terrific performances. Even with the limited amount of dialogue that the character Kaiba has throughout the story, Houko Kuwashima plays out the amnesiac archetype rather convincingly. Her voice emotes perfectly as an unemotional character who has lost all sense of meaning in his life because of how memories play a huge role to him and how that was perpetually lost. One thing to note in music is the opening song for Kaiba which is composed quite beautifully from the sublime electronic ambiance mixed with subtle orchestration. On top of that is the beautiful voice of Seira Kagami, giving a dazzling performance that sets a tone of pure melancholic loneliness, one of the main themes of the entirety of Kaiba.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s nothing quite like Kaiba&#039;s style and finesse to be found in most anime shows. I say style as in the animation, which is the only significant aspect of the show that makes it worth watching, but that&#039;s not to say that the story is terrible by any means. There&#039;s more to be seen in Kaiba than just the art and animation; but if it was only focused a little more tightly and given more world-building for it to be memorable, this would&#039;ve been ranked higher. There is no doubt people will be looking at the art style and start thinking it&#039;s nothing like anime they&#039;re used to and reject it immediately. Distinctive qualities are a rarity these days, and I&#039;m perfectly fine with this. No doubt we need more creative measures put into the medium, but when one show comes out in that one particular season that puts a lot of effort into its aesthetic qualities that challenge the norm, then that makes that one show all the more special.<br />

    Art - 10<br />
Kaiba is visually stunning and creative.  Sometimes they trade in dynamic quality of images for free animation, and it&amp;rsquo;s not a bad thing.  The art design is very Seussian, especially in architecture.  There is a wonderful roundness to everything, with nary a straight line in sight.  Despite the character design, there is an unexpected expressiveness in the facial animation.  There is a thoughtfulness in each character&amp;rsquo;s appearance that is underscored by the fact that characters don&amp;rsquo;t look anything alike unless they are twins.  The direction utilizes light and shadow brilliantly to keep the eye focused on the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review12484">
        important, active pieces.  Computer animation is good, and well integrated into the show, allowing a freedom of movement in both character and cameras that many should take note.<br />
<br />
Sound - 9<br />
I don&amp;rsquo;t want to say perfect, but the music was so well done that I really can&amp;rsquo;t say enough about it.  The ending and beginning themes really help to create this other-worldly, exploratory feeling that the viewer has while watching the show.  The most amazing part of the sound track, though is &amp;ldquo;The Tree Song.&amp;rdquo;  It&amp;rsquo;s a masterpiece.  There are three versions of the song used throughout the show and it is always implemented beautifully.  It&amp;rsquo;s varied enough that it gives meaning to many different scenes, and distinctive enough that you remember the song as a whole.  Voice acting is good on the whole.  I don&amp;rsquo;t think there was anytime that I question choices in the acting, but no one really left an impression besides Vanilla&amp;rsquo;s voice actor.  The voice actor for Popo also does a good job, giving a certain amount of depth and quality to such a badly handled character.  Some of the foley was very funny and charming.  Much of the sounds of spaceships flying, guns firing, and hitting target were quirky and added character to the world<br />
<br />
Characters - 6<br />
The characters are just ok.  Unfortunately the viewer learns so much toward the end that it becomes very overwhelming to feel like you actually know and understand each of characters and their thought processes.  Popo was interesting in the beginning, but once his motives are revealed, he is abrasively two dimensional and overexaggerated. Kaiba is quite empty.  Part of this is necessary because of the role he plays in the beginning of the show, but after a while, it becomes clear that there is no real depth to anything that he does.  While he is in Chroniko&amp;rsquo;s body he is astonishingly unconcerned with Vanilla&amp;rsquo;s feelings, and kind of mindlessly strings him along without a second thought.  Vanilla, though, is easily the best character in the show.  He is clearly conceived, and believably makes all of his decisions, no matter how vile or dumb the viewer may find them.  Kichi isn&amp;rsquo;t a bad character, but again becomes important so late in the series that it&amp;rsquo;s a shame a lot of time was wasted on other, less important, subjects.  Neiro just flat out wasn&amp;rsquo;t competently executed, bland, and a slave to the plot 90% of the time.  The only thing notable with her was an encounter she had with Chroniko-Kaiba while she was in the body of another man.<br />
<br />
Story - 5<br />
Had Kaiba been just a visual exploration of the world, rather than tethering itself down to an overall plot, then I think the creators would have had a better time with the story.  It&amp;rsquo;s very clear that the show was bound by the main plot in the last half of the show.  Kaiba is centered around the title character who has amnesia, the only notable thing is that he has is a hole in his chest and a locket of a girl. This story starts as an simple idea, then leaves that thought to explore worlds in a variety of vignettes, then coming back to the main plot cashing and burning in convolution.  Characters who play an important role in the show are completely eschewed at the beginning, and are haplessly stuffed into the end leaving no room to breathe between character studies and plot twists.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 6<br />
I was absolutely engaged with every moment of Kaiba in the first half of the show.  The worlds were lush, beautiful and captivating, with the focus characters of each episode enticing and conflicted.  I especially loved the dark mature tone and themes present in the series.  However, after that first half, as well put together as everything was, it was equally off kilter in the latter half.  Connections didn&amp;rsquo;t quite read on screen when they needed to, and the ending was honestly one of the worst in my opinion.<br />
<br />
<br />
I just finished Kaiba. I actively avoided this show last year, and after completion, I&#039;m quite disappointed that I did. The discussion I would have had while watching it would have been fun. This is an exceptional show, yet very flawed, and I actually had to look back in the comments section after certain episodes to see if I was the only one confused with certain character/plot developments, and I wasn&#039;t. I don&#039;t think Kaiba is something you watch unless your taste level has reached a certain point, so enjoyment will definitely sway because of that. I&#039;m torn between a 7 and an 8, but the story was just so terrible at the end that I can&#039;t give it an 8 in good conscience.<br />
<br />
Overall - 7

    Overview:<br />
<br />
Hot take! Kaiba is overrated as fuck! In all seriousness, Kaiba is actually a pretty good anime. The animation is stunning and the character designs are wonderfully unique. However, I wasn&#039;t a huge fan of the series from a writing standpoint and I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s one Yuasa&#039;s best works. Honestly, I liked Lu Over the Wall more than I liked Kaiba. I liked Kick-Heart more than I liked Kaiba. Cat Soup? Yep, it&#039;s still better than Kaiba. <br />
<br />
The story of Kaiba is told in an almost maddeningly confusing manner, but it&#039;s actually pretty simple. People are now able to store their memories in little

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318449">
        flash drives and switch from body to body. People can also erase bad memories and download happy memories that belonged to other people. The wealthy use this technology to keep switching bodies and live forever, while the poor sell their bodies for money. The poor are told that they will be stored on a flash drive and their families will one day be able to get them a robot body, but typically their memories are just erased and they&#039;re killed off. The poor live on shitty planets and the wealthy live on super ritzy planets that are inaccessible to everyone else. <br />
<br />
All of these are supposed to be mind blowing, incredible plot points, but everything in Kaiba is a well recycled Science Fiction trope. The story is basically just a shitty Metropolis, but doesn&#039;t say anything new about the evils of wealth inequality or social stratification. Hell, it says far less than Metropolis did 90 years ago! Evil rich guys switching bodies didn&#039;t start with Get Out. It was done in B-movies way back in the early 60s like &quot;Frankenstein Must be Destroyed!&quot; How about the part with downloading happy memories and deleting bad ones? That was done in Total Recall. Also known as Ah-nold und zee sree boobs! Back around 10 years ago there was a shitty action movie with Justin Timberlake called &quot;In Time&quot;. In that movie, poor people have to sell years off their life to wealthy people, who accumulate time until they can live basically forever. It may have 30% on Rotten Tomatoes, but it was just as deep and profound as anything I personally found in fucking Kaiba. <br />
<br />
Maybe the problem is with me. Other people watched Kaiba and got something meaningful out of it. That&#039;s awesome! More power to those people. I&#039;ve heard frequently that it&#039;s all about the importance of memories and how we should cherish all our memories including the bad ones. I mean...yeah. My grandmother has dementia. Of course I cherish my memories and fear losing them. I don&#039;t personally consider that a profound lesson, but that&#039;s just me. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve also read this series is a love letter to Osamu Tezuka. Seriously?! Of course I can&#039;t speak for Yuasa. Maybe he really said that in an interview. Personally , I have my doubts. Mr. Yuasa loves animation as a concept, but has never displayed a real love for &quot;anime&quot; as non-Japanese know it. I don&#039;t think there&#039;s an otaku bone in that man&#039;s body. There&#039;s a quote falsely attributed to Alan Moore that says &quot;I don&#039;t make comics. Those are garbage for children. I make graphic novels&quot;. While Moore never said anything like this, I could absolutely picture Yuasa saying &quot;anime is trash. I make artsy cartoons!&quot; I&#039;m supposed to believe that anime&#039;s greatest outlier, who spent his entire career being as un-anime as humanly possible decided to make a Tezuka tribute? I&#039;m calling bullshit.<br />
<br />
The character designs are pretty awesome...mostly. Then there&#039;s this flying booger named Hyo-Hyo that never ceases to be obnoxious. Navi from Zelda would make up excuses not to hang out with Hyo-Hyo. Then we have this weird black caricature with fat, blue lips and a bulging tumor on his forehead. Oh and his name is Vanilla. God damn it Yuasa. What the fuck were you thinking?<br />
<br />
We all love Yuasa. However, I feel the man is much more comfortable as an artist than as a writer. His best works are Ping Pong, Tatami, and Night is Short, which were all adaptations. When Yuasa does the writing, we end up with stuff like Cat Soup. I was disappointed by Kaiba, but I&#039;m glad other people love it. Now go and spread that love by fixing the fan wikia! As of the time of this review, the wikia is barren and has had zero effort put into it, as if nobody actually gives a shit about this series. The Wikipedia page is also a near stub and lacks basic episode summaries! There are 30,000 people just here on MAL who would say &quot;I LOVE Kaiba! I don&#039;t just include it in my favorites to look smart!&quot;. One you guys please go fix this.

    Kaiba is a Sci-fi, Adventure, Romance, Drama featuring some questionable abstract art. With such a surreal concept on &amp;lsquo;memories&amp;rsquo;, only those who are able to see this anime for its originality will be able to fully appreciate it.<br />
<br />
It&amp;rsquo;s set in a world where dying doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, as long as you have your memories you can be reborn into another body. This is certainly a fascinating premise and the series does a great job in raising some serious issues that arise due to this perpetual world. The story itself focuses on some guy named Kaiba, who wakes up with no recollection of anything about himself. It

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6958">
        seems to have a similar story telling style as the more widely known series &amp;lsquo;Kino&amp;rsquo;s Journey&amp;rsquo;, where our protagonist journeys to weird and wonderful places and quickly gets involved in other people&amp;rsquo;s live stories. Major difference is that Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s journey actually holds a purpose, as it&amp;rsquo;s more on a journey of self-discovery. This series has a non-linear storyline, making it is almost impossible to tell which direction the story is heading. All that&amp;rsquo;s left is to enjoy the emotional ride of this surreal sci-fi series, though things do get a bit hectic later on.<br />
<br />
The characters of this series are genuinely hard to judge, not only because there are so many of them involved but because ones that truly count are very complex. For most of the first half, this series is purely episodic and the various non-recurring characters do bring something of their own to the story. Then there are the few main characters that are intricately woven into the story and you&amp;rsquo;ll get to learn bit by bit about them and their memories. Kaiba &amp;amp; Neiro are the most captivating of them all.<br />
<br />
Then there&amp;rsquo;s the animation and most people will be wondering why I gave it such a high score. However where the animation lacks in any sense of realism or detail, it sure makes up for it with pure creativity and imaginative design. The music goes well with it, as there are a variety of entrancing tunes and melodies that will get anyone caught-up in the moment. Same goes for the sound FX, which really stands out during the amazing action sequences.<br />
<br />
Overall Kaiba is one of the more original anime I have come across in a while, which can truly capture many viewers. On the other hand the story is rather confusing and there are numerous issues that aren&amp;rsquo;t made clear, although it certainly did a good job in the limited time it had. I can positively say that this series isn&amp;rsquo;t for everyone, nevertheless if you can look past the childish animation then you may be able to appreciate this mature show.<br />

    **SPOILER FREE REVIEW**<br />
<br />
The anime community is filled with a bunch of liars. That’s right; I said it. We’re liars anime fans. And “Kaiba” is the proof of it.<br />
<br />
If you’re anything like me, then you couldn’t possibly count the number of times that you see a blog entry, a forum post, an article, or some sort of outcry that complains about the lack of innovation in the modern anime industry. The market is frequently bashed for pumping out the same old otaku-pandering crap every single season and losing sight of its artistic and intellectual roots.  High school slice-of-life after high school slice-of-life is announced to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review158781">
        a chorus of groans as we all scream “I want something unique!”<br />
<br />
Well, y’know what anime fans? I call bullshit. Apparently, you don’t want innovation; you want more cliché harem action-comedies that take place in otaku-paradise fantasy worlds with badass male protagonists, because that’s the only kind of thing that gets popular nowadays. You don’t know what you want. If you wanted innovation, then unique masterpieces that aren’t afraid to be experimental and push boundaries wouldn’t somehow manage to go completely unnoticed. If you wanted innovation, Kaiba would be as popular as SAO is now. Instead, it barely cracks the top 1000.<br />
<br />
So what exactly makes Kaiba such a masterpiece? Why does the fact that its only popularity stems from a small cult following of director Masaaki Yuasa (who you may know from Tatami Galaxy or Ping Pong the Animation) create such outrage? Well, that’s a loaded question. Obligatory review-intro aside, let’s delve into one of my all time favorite anime:<br />
<br />
Synopsis: In this world, technology exists that makes it possible to store human memories as data, so that the death of your body is not actually death. As memories are stored in databanks, they can be transferred into new and different bodies. Because so-called &quot;memory trading&quot; now occurs, it is now possible to steal memories, illegally alter them, sell them, etc. Good memories can be downloaded and bad ones can be erased; a luxury only available to the rich and powerful. One day, a man awakens in a ruined room. His name is Kaiba. Kaiba has no memories of his own, but he does have a lot to figure out about his past.<br />
 <br />
Besides the artwork (more on that later), the first thing that stands out about Kaiba is how INCREADIBLE its world-building is.  Not only is it a world rich with creativity and depth, but so much about it is conveyed with so little exposition. This anime tells its story through expressions, thoughts, symbolism, and other devices that don’t need to be spoken aloud more than it does through traditional methods, and that is arguably the most beautiful part about it. SO much emotion is conveyed in this twisted, thought-provoking setting that blurs the lines of ethics, morality, and individualism.  This is a very philosophical show, but it’s FAR from pretentious or preachy; it rarely, if ever overtly discusses these serious topics, but rather conveys them without words. While that aspect may serve to potentially alienate viewers who don’t like to think about what they are watching, to hell with them; be prepared to absorb a lot of different ideas and concepts when you watch this show. Kaiba tells a tale that not only sucks us into its universe and makes us care deeply about its characters, but it also causes us to think in ways that we likely never have before. While Kaiba’s tranquil mood and bright color pallet may mask the mature nature of the show, make no mistake that this is one of the most meticulously crafted, subtly brilliant, and perfectly paced plots I’ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing. There is much more I could say, but no words I come up with will ever be able to do Kaiba justice. You simply have to watch it for yourself to understand.<br />
<br />
The characters are my favorite part about Kaiba; it is without a doubt one of the most incredible and memorable casts of all time. There are no good guys, there are no bad guys. There are only people; people with very distinct, very moving desires, motivations, and pasts. I cared more deeply for this cast of characters then I did for any other anime cast in a long, long time. Even the episodic characters that don’t get much screen time find their way into the hearts of the viewers. I’m STILL in awe of how masterfully executed the characterization of the side-characters was; even people who were only around for a single episode felt so genuinely human and fleshed out. Even they, however, have nothing on the trio of Kaiba, Neiro, and Popo, who stand out as some of the most multi-faceted characters imaginable. In addition to the sheer depth of the cast, it must be noted that the chemistry between the characters is stupendous. The emotional connections that the characters make with one another are remarkably authentic and believable. In short, these characters feel human. Very human. Their respective personalities carry the show and serve as perfect vessels for the show’s central themes; this is character writing at its absolute finest ladies and gentlemen.<br />
<br />
By far the most controversial part about Kaiba is its artwork, but by no means should that be the case. It absolutely sickens me to think that such an experimental, refreshing, visually appealing, and one of a kind art style can be the primary reason that this show never became popular. The bold colors and lines serve the narrative beautifully as they create a fluid world full of intrigue and surrealist imagery that leave a lasting impression on the audience. I don’t care that it’s simplistic; as far as I’m concerned, this animation is near-perfect and you will never see anything else like it. Tag on the hauntingly beautiful and mood-setting OST along with a very memorable OP/ED set and you have yourself some outstanding and uniquely brilliant production values.<br />
<br />
In conclusion… WHY THE HELL HAS NOBODY SEEN THIS? Kaiba is one of the most unique and incredible works the industry has ever produced and yet I have not heard it brought up in a conversation so much as once. Anime fans, do yourself a giant favor and find a way to watch this incredible series. It reminded me why I am a fan of the medium in the first place. Maybe it can do the same for you.

    The universe sits atop a house of cards, with revolution shaking at the base. And Kaiba truly does hold an entire universe in its hands. <br />
This is Sci-Fi through and through, and every bit of it overflows with imagination and experimentation. The strongest aspect of this show is how comfortable the writers felt in their own world. They put passion into this, and tried to make something that would last in the audience&#039;s memories. Apart from any pacing or plot problems that may have arisen, this was written in confidence. None of the lesser points are because of weak willed writers unwilling to be adventurous.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review96227">
        If you want to see something different and intriguing, I give a hearty recommendation on that basis alone. If you also happen to be a fan of Sci-Fi, well then, sharpen your knives and prepare for a feast. (Viewers with little patience should probably sit this one out though.) <br />
<br />
Right off the bat, Kaiba starts with a character that has amnesia, and that sends up a bunch of warning signals. Many stories with poor writing will proudly display an amnesiac protagonist because it frees up the job of writing complex personality, pre-existing character interactions, and is just a giant gateway to spoon-feed plot and exposition to the audience. But do not fear, for Kaiba never once considers being a shoddy, overused amnesia story. In fact, the amnesia is more of just a presence that is ever-looming, not overbearing. They don&#039;t waste energy trying to cover holes with it, but instead rip apart the foundations of this trope and rebuild it anew, devoting the entire premise of this show to memories. Even if the execution wasn&#039;t masterful, they plunged head first into trying something different, and of course, that is where this show excels.<br />
<br />
With the whole element of memory storage and body swapping, our main character Warp actually spends a great deal of time in a cheaply made, mute body, incapable of speaking. This does suppress how much of his personality can be expressed, and in the beginning, his position in the show isn&#039;t clear. The same can be said for many of his companions. But in the same manner that silent or minimalistic films make more from less, we are given brief moments to step into the mind of Warp. Each little morsel of his character development made more savory by their rarity and good delivery.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the entire cast. Kaiba is more about the story, and does sacrifice the quality of its supporting characters for the sake of plot points. Being partially episodic, Kaiba sometimes tries to cram entire character arcs into one or two sittings. Leaving the writers to fall back on melodrama to try and relay an expansive history or grand emotions in a compressed time. It can distance the viewer from the characters and belay the intentions of the production team. In other cases, certain episodes will excel within their limited time, and give us touching, memorable characters and anecdotes. This is a fluctuation in quality that wanes over time, leaving most of the second half solidly written.<br />
<br />
Much like GitS: SAC, it&#039;s less of a classical narrative, and more of a series of experiences woven together. The precision is still there, and the plot takes you somewhere, just not in the typical manner. Power, lust, greed, lies, righteousness, pain, and bonds of friendship all weave an ever tightening noose that threatens to choke the ruling class. In the world of Kaiba, human equality isn’t even an afterthought, and our crew is ready to take back their dignity, and a little more for good measure. Caught in a power struggle with ever shifting tides, the weak are forever pushed further into the abyss as the strong climb upwards. Puppets and scapegoats, forced into destructive bodies and unable to feel or draw happiness, they are scattered about as simple war machines. Despite all of their artificial power, they remain true helpless souls. With minds used, battered and abused, they dwell in the deepest pit carved by humanity, and sit there alone, betrayed by others&#039; ambitions and their own tainted memories. Kaiba performs a tragic duel between our own identity, and the persona that others sculpt for us.<br />
<br />
Kaiba takes up residence in the &quot;here&#039;s what we can do with anime as a medium&quot; category. It&#039;s artwork contests traditional design and usually comes up on top. On the technical side of things, it goes for fluidity rather than individual details, meaning this show rarely sits still. The frames keep turning, and action, reaction, and intricacy are all captured in the animation. They can afford to do this because of the simplistic character structures and complete lack of shading. Now this is a stylistic choice, and I think it goes well with the overall atmosphere of the show. At times it&#039;s truly jaw dropping, and you get the impression that any other style of art simply wouldn&#039;t have worked for this series. On the flip side, there are a few moments where nothing is happening, the movement stops, and the magic sort of drains away for a second. However, there is something in the art department that is uncontestedly good. The CG integration is hardly noticeable at all, even when the fast, sweeping shots cover a lot of background, it looks very smooth and naturally painted.<br />
<br />
Sticking with story over characters, the score doesn&#039;t really have any character themes that show up like in other anime. There are mostly just soundtracks to enhance the action or accompany the mood of a scene. These only show up occasionally, and for the rest of the show, and bulk of it, we&#039;re given diegetic sounds and environmental noises that usually complement the atmosphere. In this aspect, it&#039;s not the best sound editing I&#039;ve heard, but most of the time there are clean transitions, good sound effects, and nothing too obtrusively out of place. The music itself is poignant. The melodies of Kiyoshi Yoshida range from whimsical to pondering melancholy, and will stay with you long after the episode has run its course. Just like with Warp&#039;s character moments, the music is withheld until it&#039;s appropriate, and when it&#039;ll be cherished most by the audience. Now, while the compositions are very good, the implementation is a bit clumsy sometimes, and it can get noticeable when songs are reused too often.<br />
<br />
Given how Kaiba tries to avoid dry heaps of exposition, the dialogue is an ever occurring source of world-building. Just like the viewer, Warp is trying to absorb everything from other people and his surroundings. This calls for more intricate writing, and is very effective in synchronizing the audience with the emotions and experiences of Warp, when it works. Sadly, the first couple of episodes were still exploring this, trying to find a solid tempo and direction, and so some of the scenes can feel scripted and unnatural. This is particularly noticeable with some moments of oddly placed comedy. But again, this all gets ironed out as the episode count grows, and it becomes a much smoother ride. <br />
<br />
The voice acting is above the standard fare, but won&#039;t have you clamoring to see the actors in other roles. Everyone does their job, and they do it well, particularly one actor who does deserve special mention. Hisao Egawa knocks it straight out of the park from the very moment he appears on screen. Providing the voice of Vanilla, he steps directly into the character, encapsulating the absurd, blundering, and over-the-top personality of our not so noble sheriff.<br />
<br />
In the end we walk away with a very well controlled space oddity that radiates familiarity from the writers, as if they&#039;ve spent part of their lives in this future universe. A superb drama? Not quite. But an intricate story that explores outside the realm of typical series. With that in mind, this is not a show meant to be watched casually. An attentive viewer is required to get the most out of what it has to offer. If you&#039;re looking for something to put on in the background, hold off on this show until you have time to truly watch it. Otherwise, get ready for a fantastic Sci-Fi experience.<br />
<br />
My final verdict for this show is a respectable 8.4

    There&#039;s a scene in the first episode of Kaiba where our main character sits in the main foyer of this small community, watching as various bits of human drama happens around him. This scene is a lesson in introductory worldbuilding. Kaiba is an extraordinarily complicated science fiction world in which bodies are disposable and one can acquire a new body by transporting your mind from one to another. You infer all of that from a series of scenes in which some people are trying to work out which person&#039;s mind is installed on each of these new memory chips. Other people walk past complaining they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review153549">
        their friend has changed since getting their new body, while another family moans and complains that they&#039;ve got to share this cheap, immobile body because they&#039;re too poor to afford better ones. It&#039;s a brilliant piece of writing and directing that manages to divulge the information you need to understand the world while telling small individual funny stories in the process. It&#039;s the massively preferable alternative to the infodump many other shows choose.<br />
<br />
That scene in the opening episode sets up largely what Kaiba is about. This is a world in which both bodies and memories can be bought and sold and what sort of scenarios would happen if that was the case. A young girl sells her body to a rich collector with her mind being put temporarily in storage so her family can feed themselves. A very strange person sticks her mind into another body so she can have sex with her own body. As our amnesiac main character travels from planet to planet with only a very vague goal in mind (with half of that time in the body of a mute inflatable hippo) we see this vast universe and what weird ways society reacts when these scientific advances occur. It is science fiction at its absolute best in that regard. With these scientific advances it shows how it changes the world, from the rich to the poor, from the old to the young, from the charitable to the selfish, from love to hate.<br />
<br />
The best episode of Kaiba is where he visits the super rich planet where people are buying and disposing of bodies within weeks as the newest ones come into fashion. The streets are lined with advertisements for the latest bodies of varying ridiculousness and impracticality. People strut down catwalks with their new five-limbed, three-headed bodies. The latest and hippest body fashion trend is decided by Patch, a genius artist who designs bodies for a living. However when our main character visits Patch, it turns out he is a mad old creature cut off from the world. He hates the rampant spending of the upper class and he tries to punish them by designing increasingly impractical and stupid looking bodies. As soon as those bodies are put into mass production though, advertising immediately sells them as the next big thing and we see people walking the streets with those very bodies Patch just described as horribly impractical and stupid.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s an absolutely genius episode in so many ways. Like the best science fiction it shows that as much as science might change, society will still act in pretty similar ways. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Patch&#039;s creation of impractical bodies mocking the upper class who then proceed to buy them anyway without understanding the irony reminds me of rich people spending millions on Banksy art pieces. A bunch of those are specifically targeting the follies of the upper class and their wasteful approach towards spending money on the impractical, yet there they are buying those exact street scrawled art pieces. There are other little pieces of genius in that episode, such as the fact people live by eating the processed scraps of old discarded bodies, or that one of the more popular designed bodies is based on an attractive terrorist that has been on the news lately, or that Patch has a little dog he cobbled together from bits of thrown out older dogs &quot;because they want foreign dogs that look better than the local ones&quot;. The levels of social commentary Kaiba creates from its science fiction is masterful.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately Kaiba has an overarching story and that&#039;s where it all starts to fall apart a little. The story in concept is pretty good actually, because it draws from the same &quot;what if&quot; scenario the rest of the small stories draw from. It&#039;s basically a love story in which two Romeo and Juliet styled characters from different societies fall in love and somehow stay in love even when they change bodies, have both their minds altered and are told to kill each other. It&#039;s a touching story about the POWAH OF LURVE that Kaiba manages to do an excellent job of exploring for the first two thirds of the series, but really starts to fuck it up towards the end. It starts to introduce too many characters with their own little desires and stories who start to take up more screentime. Some of these stories are interesting but they try to cram in too much into too small a time. There&#039;s only 12 episodes in Kaiba and the first 8 episodes of this are individual episodic stories. There are only 3 characters that truly matter and if they could cut out all the ancillary bullshit we would have had a much better and more satisfying conclusion that I would have been able to follow.<br />
<br />
The last two episodes in particular are pretty awful. Kaiba basically turns into End of Evangelion. No really, when I say End of Eva I really mean it. One character wants the world to become one mind so they stop feeling pain anymore and then a whole load of imagery happens that&#039;s impossible to follow and then at the end everyone ends up on a beach looking confused. It&#039;s way more hopeful and positive than End of Eva&#039;s tirade of hate and self-loathing. Instead of feeling confused and dirty like you&#039;ve just swam through a sewage infested river like End of Eva, at the end of Kaiba you feel confused but mildly content like you&#039;ve just been swimming through a sea of dandelion seeds. I saw Kaiba back in 2008 when it first came out and I remembered the ending being a letdown, but rewatching it really brought into stark relief what an awful ending it has. It&#039;s a shame because the rest of the show is one of the best implementations of science fiction in any piece of fiction ever. I would still highly recommend people watch it. Just be prepared for a confusing and unsatisfying ending.

    I totally like that anime.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m definitely fond of the art. It&#039;s weird in a realistic way, but just let your mind getting used to it, you&#039;ll find it clearly outstanding. Don&#039;t forget the studio&#039;s not a bunch of idiots : it&#039;s Madhouse, eh.<br />
<br />
Story&#039;s dark, definitely NOT for children, but it&#039;s such an idea...<br />
<br />
Opening theme is definitely art, music and drafts. It made me think of Ef - a tale of memories for the artistic way of introducing the anime. But when you watch it, you clearly understand it has nothing to do with Ef-atom.<br />
<br />
Just give the first episode a try. You&#039;ll get the reason why

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4674">
        it&#039;s not an anime like getting superpowers, being superheroes, and so on.<br />
<br />
And if you don&#039;t understand anything at first, you get some clues in next episodes, that relveal some dark aspects of that world...<br />
<br />
One of the best animes I&#039;ve ever watched.

    Memories. They’re a wonderful thing, aren’t they? The ability to transport our minds back to simpler times of childhood; to look back and reflect on days gone by and to appreciate the various things we did years ago, whether that was experiencing our awkward first love during adolescence, an old friend whom you used to play with as a child, or just simple family gatherings whether that be for the celebration of some kind of event be it Christmas or Thanksgiving, or just gathering around to watch a movie together. But, there are also the bad memories, that I’m sure everyone has. The memories we

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263972">
        would want to erase from our mind, and would do so in a heartbeat if given the opportunity to do so. Our memories of past experiences, both the good and the bad, are what shapes the person we are today, and the entire theme surrounding memories has been tackled in plenty of dystopian and cyberpunk narratives in films over the years, but the one piece of media that I have seen that tackles this idea to its fullest capabilities, in the most creative and beautiful way I might add, is Masaki Yuasa’s Kaiba! If you’re familiar with my past reviews, then you know that I’ve praised this man’s works to no end, that being The Tatami Galaxy and Ping Pong, two anime that I absolutely adore, and are some of my favourites works in the entire medium, with Kaiba being no exception to that. Kaiba is a wonderfully creative endeavour with its experimental and imaginative world, setting and characters, that not only has become one of my personal favourite anime as of late, but is a delightful reminder of why I love animation so much, and all of the endless creative potentials it can bring along with it, culminating in a work that emotionally moved me in ways that no other anime or film has been able to in a long time. It’s like if Masaki Yuasa, smoked a ton of drugs and Kaiba’s unique visuals was the product of his hallucinations. Anyway, with that all said and done, let’s dive into the mad world that is Kaiba!<br />
<br />
Set in a world in which one’s memories can be stored in small devices known as “chips”, people can live on, even when their body has lived passed its physical limitations, or has been badly destroyed, and have their memories implanted into another host, thus living on. In addition, the inhabitants of the world of Kaiba can chose to have their memories altered in several ways, adding new happier memories, or removing those memories that are too painful to bear. However, this comes at a catch, as only the rich and powerful can afford to transplant their memories into new hosts, with them ruling from the top, whilst the rest of the world is left at the bottom, a world without authority, in which the illegal alteration and trafficking of bodies and memories runs rampant. In this world, our main protagonist, Kaiba, travels throughout the land, with no memories of his own, as he meets new people and encounters new planets, eventually gaining his memory once again.<br />
<br />
Kaiba’s narrative can essentially be split into two halves; the first of which deals with Kaiba in a more episodic narrative structure as he travels from planet to planet, meeting new people, learning about their experiences and the world, with the second half becoming more plot-heavy involving a resistance group fighting against the tyrannical rule of Warp, the ruler of this world. Now, it is not my proactive to insinuate that you have to wait several episodes for Kaiba to “get good” or more plot-heavy. I’d argue in fact that the first half of the series is more emotionally heavy in many ways than that of the second half, with each episode being its own self-contained emotional rollercoaster, all of which were able to resonate with me on some kind of emotional level. Every character Kaiba meets in the first half of the series, despite their simplistic characters as a whole, are still able to convey a wonderful story in their own respective episodes, packing an insane emotional punch at the climax for each one. Every episode explores something different about the world, and adds on to our understanding of said world, and the sheer number of themes and ideas that is pumped into the show, all the while allowing each respective theme time to develop and breath, is staggering and a true testament of the writing of the series. From episodes in which one has to come to the reality of losing a loved one, and having to come to grips with that loss, to a deeper look and understanding of sexuality and gender, and what this truly means when we see both Kaiba, whom now has moved his memories into a woman’s body, and another character, whom he meets, who has done the opposite, to how memories are stored in this world, and how they’re managed. Each episode in the first half the anime is rich in themes and ideas, and keeps building on our understanding of this world, and the way in which it operates, all of which I found to be deeply interesting! It deals with the loss of loved ones, the valuable nature of memories, the cost at which humans are willing to prolong their own, and their loved ones lives, and manages to tell captivating stories around these ideas, with characters that have boat loads of heart. While one may argue that I am being manipulated into feeling something for these characters, through the use of an emotional backstory, something that I myself have complained about in other shows before, but the characters in Kaiba never came across to me as if they were designed as a means of manipulating my emotions. Each one is grounded in their stories, and the fantastic writing and character interactions, as well as their clearly defined personalities, makes them feel incredibly human and real to me, so that when any unfortunate event does occur, I feel the emotional weight the show is trying to convey, and it’s the main reason why I can get so invested in the world and the characters, so much so, that some episodes even brought me to tears! (Real men shed tears when watching cartoons, okay!)<br />
<br />
In addition to all this, the world and setting of Kaiba, and all of the locales he travels to within the first half the story, are incredibly memorable, all of whom take on such vivid personalities in my mind. Not only is this incredibly effective at worldbuilding, but the extremely well-designed locals also help me become more invested in the show I am watching, and this also extends to the creative technology the show is filled with too, from belts that can grow legs to help move past terrain quickly, to a strange looking gun that is capable of melting bodies with one simple blast! In addition, during these episodes, Kaiba will often use a similar sort of gun, in order to gain access into their memories and their subconscious. It’s used as a creative way to inform the audience about the psychological implications each character is facing, while laying down the ground work in order to give the audience subtle little hints into Kaiba’s past, making the process of learning about his complete backstory in the second half, feel that more gratifying and satisfying. Each creative element in the show, from the setting to the technology, is used to enhance the narrative, and its clear how much love and thought was placed into making the world as wonderfully unique as possible.<br />
<br />
The narrative is also just incredibly satisfying to watch play out, with constant forks in the road and plot twists to keep things interesting, and to constantly keep me second guessing. It’s that feeling of satisfaction you get when watching a mystery play out, and seeing all the pieces come together in your mind that you say to yourself, “ah!” as a cartoony light-bulb pings above your head. Kaiba in a way, is a mystery narrative, with Kaiba attempting to learn about the true nature of where he came from, and who he is, which comes to fruition in the second half, where the constant questions we were posed with in the beginning get answered. This mainly functions as a means to get the audience invested in Kaiba as a character, and all of the constituent characters in his past too, but I believe that by starting Kaiba with no knowledge of the world or how it works was greatly beneficial to the overall story. Much like how Kaiba knows nothing of this world, neither do we as an audience member, and we experience the world through his eyes. Everything Kaiba experiences and feels, so do we, and not only does this make the emotional moments all the more hard hitting, but it helps us get invested in this character and feel as if we’re really embarking on a journey with him. Information about the world therefore, is offered through the visuals and what Kaiba sees, allowing the audience to try and piece things together, and I believe this is particularly effective in the first episode in which Kaiba watches from afar, the activities of the people of this world. Through their actions, and behaviours, we understand a lot about this world, and the circumstances of what it is like to live there, from seeing a couple having a fight, whereupon the woman walks out proclaiming she has had enough of this world (which sounds a lot like Tommy Wiseau now that I think about it; I swear that was not my intention when I wrote the first draft for this), to a group of people rummaging through memory chips, and selling those they do not want anymore, to an old man who tells Kaiba he has seen the entire world, for it to be known to us, by his wife pulling him away, that none of that has happened, and that he has gone Senile for living in this place for so long. All of these little things help to paint a picture of the world at large without having to resort to expository dialogue, and this may seem like a pedantic thing to praise, but its small little things like this that I notice and end up appreciating. It’s going that little extra mile, is what makes a show truly special to me, and Kaiba is full of this!<br />
<br />
Kaiba’s characters are also great, and, as I’ve already expressed greatly in regards to the people whom we meet in the first half of the series, all of whom, despite being rather simplistic, still are able to resonate with me emotionally. One of the better examples, is Vanilla, a character that falls in love with our protagonist Kaiba, after Kaiba transfers his memories into the body of a girl in the third episode. While Vanilla is most regulated to be the bumbling idiot, with a gut the size of a house, and is a complete asshole, this fat bastard did actually manage to make me cry in the seventh episode of the show. He genuinely cares for that of Kaiba (now in the body of a girl called Chroniko) and he even remarks that he is not able to save his mother anymore, as he had been holding her memory chip this entire time, suggesting a more compassionate and caring person then we were lead to believe at first. Kaiba’s other characters, particularly those whom we meet in the second half in the resistance group against the rich high above are hard to talk about without going into spoiler territory, and I don’t want to rob any of those who haven’t seen Kaiba yet of their charm and overall impact in the story. What I will say, is that the relationships between some of the characters, namely that of Kaiba’s and Neiro’s, fills natural and organic, as if they’re really two people who genuinely care deeply about one another, making the events that happen between them, all the more emotional to me, since I was deeply invested in both of them as actual people.  <br />
<br />
As previously mentioned, the world of Kaiba is amazing, and that also extends to the animation as well. Kaiba utilises so many different animation techniques, and is constantly changing its style during much of its runtime; it’s a visual orgasm! It’s also a show that nails the more cartoony-esque art style, with plenty of stretch-and-pull for that cartoony sort of aesthetic and vibe, with some of the most memorable and interesting character designs I’ve seen from an anime as well. The more childlike imagery and designs, also contrasts well with the more adult-oriented themes, mainly of the cruelty of the world, a tone and juxtaposition I liked a lot in the show. There are even plenty of times when the animation can downright be stunning, such as in the case where Vanilla and Choroniko are represented as two brightly lit neon coloured figures in the night sky. The entire show is dripping with personality and it’s clear how much passion and work was put into the animation. One little feature I also loved was the scale of the world in regards to the size of the characters, and helped to insinuate the difference in power and class between that of the rich and that of the poor. The music, likewise, is also wonderful. The opening track, Never, is nothing short of what I would call beautiful, with its soft, almost melancholic at times, lyrics and singing. Other tracks I adored were Planets, Initialise me and Twinkling Photon. Every track in Kaiba is wonderfully composed and each track I can recite in my head with no problem; they’re that memorable to me, setting the atmosphere for each locale, bringing each one to life! (Also, is it just me, or does the track “Chase to it!” sound like something that would fit right at home in the original Terminator movie?)<br />
<br />
In conclusion, if it weren’t evident by now, I love Kaiba! While I dislike using this term, for any piece of media to describe anything, considering how incredibly subjective it is, I feel as if it is necessary for this show, and that is that Kaiba is a beautiful work of art. Through it’s amazing world, characters, charm and personality, Kaiba was a series I was able to get deeply invested in whilst watching, and I loved every second of this show. It succeeds in every area, telling a rich and powerfully emotional story, and while some of the characters Kaiba meets in the first half can be rather simplistic, I believe that the writing is strong enough to salvage such characters, grounding them in a sense of believability and realism. Kaiba checks off all of my boxes for what I look for in anime, and just proves even more why Masaki Yuasa is one of my favourite auteurs in this medium, with his “big three” (that including the show I’m currently talking about, Tatami and Ping Pong) being some of the best works in anime, in my humblest opinion, and I’d recommend checking out all three if you have not done so already. Kaiba is a show that I won’t be forgetting any time soon…<br />

    [INTRODUCTION]<br />
<br />
Kaiba is a show that everyone should watch. Not because anything that it does story-wise is particularly spectacular, but because of how fundamentally different it is from everything else in terms of raw artistry with its music and visuals. It&#039;s not an outstandingly good show, but everything that it presents to the viewer is just so damn unique and interesting that I can&#039;t help but recommend it. The concept itself may not be original, but the execution certainly is, and it&#039;s the execution that makes this show worth watching.<br />
<br />
STORY [5/10]<br />
<br />
Kaiba takes place in a world where people can transfer their minds between each other&#039;s bodies.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263926">
        It explores the consequences of doing so by showing how various characters&#039; lives are ruined by the cruelty of this society. The hero is an amnesiac who finds himself under attack in a mysterious room, holding a locket which contains the picture of a girl who is a wanted terrorist. Although interesting, the premise itself is nothing new. What makes it stand out in Kaiba is the overall atmosphere of the show.<br />
<br />
While most cyberpunk shows would go for an action-packed, thrilling adventure story about a group of rebels overthrowing this system, Kaiba instead focuses on the more intimate and emotional aspects of the mind-swapping process, for better or for worse. The first half of the series is very episodic in nature, a collection of slightly connected fables each focusing on a different cast of characters and how they have been touched by the mind-swapping technology. These episodes are very, very sad, sometimes so much so that it can be difficult to suspend one&#039;s disbelief. Additionally, these episodes are very hit-or-miss. Some are great, and some aren&#039;t. Although some characters are easy to get emotionally invested in, others just kind of exist and force you to sit through their episode, hoping that the next one will be more interesting.<br />
<br />
As the story progresses and more information about our hero&#039;s past is revealed, a plot begins to take shape, ditching the episodic structure around episode 9. At this point, lots of unexpected, bizarre, and exciting things happen. If you haven&#039;t been paying close attention, it may be difficult to understand or enjoy what is going on. It&#039;s worth noting that some viewers have complained that the ending of Kaiba feels &quot;rushed,&quot; but I didn&#039;t have this problem. Some of the twists near the end do, however, have a habit of feeling forced or random, which can be a problem if you already had trouble suspending your disbelief through the episodic portion.<br />
<br />
By the way, this show is not for children. It&#039;s confusing, violent, depressing, and sexual. The character designs might look cute, but, as many anime fans know, this means nothing in regard to how the actual story will play out. If you&#039;re looking for a family-friendly show, find something else.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS [5/10]<br />
<br />
The characters in Kaiba are defined by their experiences, not their personalities. Much like the episodes themselves, not every character is immediately interesting. Many of the characters carry their own episodes - if you like a character, you&#039;ll probably like their episode. If not, well... tough luck. Because their personalities aren&#039;t as developed as their backstories, no characters are especially memorable or unusual, and a few of them are difficult to sympathize with, which is a grave flaw in a tragedy-based show. <br />
<br />
The most interesting thing about the characters is that they don&#039;t have static designs. Because of the mind-swapping sci-fi shenanigans which are always present, you&#039;ll see different characters using a single body at different times, single characters hopping between many different bodies, and personalities shifting seemingly at random. This is difficult to get used to at the beginning, especially because many of the characters&#039; personalities aren&#039;t immediately apparent, and you will probably need a sheet to keep track of whose mind is in whose body at any given time.<br />
<br />
In terms of character relationships, the main focus is on the romance between Warp and Neiro, which is interesting because of how they love each other even through different bodies. Much like a Makoto Shinkai film, Kaiba dwells on the bittersweet separation between two lovers - something that I&#039;ve never cared for, but that I can&#039;t deny is an intriguing aspect of the story.<br />
<br />
ART [9/10]<br />
<br />
Studio Madhouse is known for the quality of their artwork, but they really outdid themselves here. Rather than using traditional anime character designs, they opted for a much more avant-garde style, one reminiscent of mid-20th century American cartoons. The drawings in Kaiba are heavily stylized, soft, and round, looking almost like they were shaped out of play-doh or drawn by a child. Rather than feeling lazily put-together, this only makes the characters all the more endearing. There is a certain human frailty which is conveyed through the use of these designs, one that enforces the story&#039;s themes much better than most anime artwork could.<br />
<br />
The simplicity of the character designs also allows for the animators to do much more with their movement. Even by Madhouse standards, the action is especially fluid and captivating, and a surprising amount of emotion can be conveyed through simple facial expressions and body language. This is, of course, all thanks to the talent of Misaaki Yuasa, the avant-garde directorial genius behind The Tatami Galaxy and Ping Pong: the Animation.<br />
<br />
While the characters look small, fragile, and easily moved by their environment, the backgrounds are a stark contrast in their imposing nature, characterized by towering cliffs and tiny windows carved into the walls of threatening castles and spaceships. The oppressive feeling given by the backgrounds really adds to the story&#039;s overall emotional impact, and Kaiba would feel incomplete without the art presented in the way that it is.<br />
<br />
SOUND [8/10]<br />
<br />
My favorite part of this show was its soundtrack. Kiyoshi Yoshida and Seira Kagami did a wonderful job with the OP, which remains among my favorites for its soothing, simplistic, and somehow still emotionally rich melody and instrumentation. The soundtrack makes very good use of synthesizers and non-acoustic noises to heighten the mysterious, sci-fi vibe that the show gives off, and it thankfully stays hauntingly beautiful because it never goes overboard with loudness or complexity. My only complaint is that there were only a few different songs used in the show - as great as many of them are, they can get old after a few listens.<br />
<br />
Not the OP, though. That will never get old.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT [5/10] -- FINAL SCORE [6.4/10]<br />
<br />
While I can certainly appreciate how unique Kaiba&#039;s artwork is, it occasionally left me feeling a bit more alienated than I believe was intended. On the personal side of things, I&#039;ve never been much for romances or gratuitously emotional dramas, so there were parts of the show that I just couldn&#039;t enjoy as much as I feel most viewers would. Nonetheless, Kaiba is an anime that I&#039;m not likely to forget anytime soon, and is one that everyone needs to watch.<br />

    I’m going to discuss Kaiba in terms of the three modes of persuasion: ethos (persuasion through presentation), logos (logical persuasion), and pathos (emotional persuasion). I do this, because the fact that Kaiba is very uninteresting to me is ironically very interesting to me.<br />
<br />
Regarding ethos:<br />
I felt secondhand embarrassment watching Kaiba, because I’ve made art like Kaiba before: Art that is so serious and earnest yet so unimportant. Kaiba is an entirely serious show, but I could not take it seriously. The biggest problem, in my opinion, drives the anime so much further down than any of its “minor” shortcomings and cliches (information being withheld, inexhaustible flashbacks,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402852">
        spoon-feeding the plot to the audience, guns that fail to work only against important characters, songs that try hard to evoke melodrama, characters with simple motivations in service of the plot [this is not a character-driven story, which makes it a little less interesting imo]). The biggest problem is so much worse than any of those mediocre story-telling devices. It is the unshakable nature of the anime being completely serious, unironic, and unapologetic in its attempt to wow and move the audience using very insubstantial drama and minimally explored themes (of memory chips, replaceable bodies, human nature, capitalism, and globalization). Most of the characters being one-dimensional (had a few traits each) and acting like children (suitable and reminiscent of kids shows) did not help matters. <br />
<br />
Regarding logos: <br />
The “sci-fi” (science-fiction) tag is truly the most enigmatic scrawl I’ve had the prerogative to investigate. I used to think that only the highest of stories deemed scientifically plausible would be conferred this emblem of intellectual creativity; I was quickly proven wrong as I noticed that some sci-fi are almost completely implausible, or at least, grossly speculative and without a single line of justification. I decided then that there must be a spectrum, a scale, as with most things, on which some sci-fi are more science and some more fiction. Today, I disagree with both of those past stances. I now think that all sci-fi contain some speculative elements and some realistic elements, and, in effect, concede that every sci-fi is indeed unrealistic, which is why they are called “sci-fi” and not “hyper-realistic thrillers containing only currently available technologies.” To put it simply, all sci-fi contain unexplainable phenomena that may or may not come to exist in the future.<br />
<br />
However, some sci-fi really stretch the boundaries of its genre. I’ve noticed that anime in particular often does this, where borderline fantasy is often either tagged as (or mistaken for) potential future technology or circumstances. Kaiba is one of those anime. How? As Charlie would say: You do the math.<br />
<br />
I’m kidding. I’ll do the math. In Kaiba, rich people buy poor people’s bodies. That will not happen in our world. And I don’t mean human trafficking or smuggling organs. I mean rich people transplanting their memories into poor people; this will not happen. For countless logical and ethical and legal reasons, rich people will instead artificially design or request the most efficient bodies from tightly controlled labs with scientists and AI smarter than we can imagine. Kaiba, in that sense, is completely irrelevant to reality if it seriously means to be sci-fi. Besides some symbolic value or being a mental exercise in futility, Kaiba is valueless in terms of being a sci-fi, void of any logical merits. <br />
<br />
I’ve resigned myself to the fact that I’ve gathered absolutely nothing new or complex from this anime that I haven’t thought or known about already, despite my dire efforts to derive from the anime any food for thought.<br />
<br />
Regarding pathos:<br />
I’m the kind of person who becomes teary-eyed watching anything the slightest bit sad, and yet, I only teared up during this anime from the stress induced by the fact that the anime said near nothing despite being so stressfully fast-paced. It rather reminded me of The Tatami Galaxy. <br />
<br />
About Chroniko’s story: I was sad and really almost cried. But I was also mighty bored. I am sorry (to the animators who tried hard), but each of the sob stories were so standard and cliched that my mind gnawed at itself in boredom. I understand that Chroniko’s story is a real world problem, however. I think that it is an IMPORTANT theme, but it wasn&#039;t any radical or deep one, just like every other theme in the show.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, I award Kaiba with its extra score (2 instead of 1) for having allowed this self-analysis. I’ve wondered before why some stories don’t reach me. It was especially puzzling this time because I love sci-fi. I understand a bit better now.<br />

Long version:<br />

Memories are one of the few things in our world

          <span style="display: none;" id="review197000">
        that are invaluable. Rich or poor, strong or weak, we all have memories exclusive to us. It is these memories that make us who we are and molds our persona. Without our memories, we are nothing but a shell of our genuine self. Kaiba is set in a world where memories are given physical form. They are bought, sold, stolen or even eaten like food. It tells a story of love in a cruel dystopia and it does it superbly.<br />
<br />
The story starts off rather confusing. We are shown, Kaiba, our main character waking up in the middle in of a ravaged village with no recollection of his memories. The first episode leaves you with a huge amount of questions which acts as a great hook as it would pique your interest with a strong mystery factor. However this can also be a double edged sword as people who are looking for straight forward narratives can be put off with the huge confusion. By the end, most of these questions are answered either by ambiguous or clear ways. The first half of the anime consists mainly of episodic stories of different characters Kaiba meets across space. These episodes do a sublime job of showcasing the diabolical setting through the tragic tales of different people across the universe that emotionally immerse the viewer. The second half of the anime addresses the main narrative which revolves around Kaiba&#039;s lost memories. This half is filled with unexpected plot twists, intense conflicts and endearing romance.<br />
<br />
Since he has no memories, the main character doesn&#039;t have much of a personality at the start. He is usually listening to other characters talking to him for the majority of the time. He doesn&#039;t show anything that makes him distinct or enable you to relate to him which makes him dull for the most part. Although that can be excused as a plot factor, it still makes it harder for the viewer to relate to Kaiba. This becomes less of a problem later on because Kaiba undergoes some development in the second half as he regains his memories but he stills remains slightly dull without much of a personality, acting mostly as a plot device. The supporting characters is rich and most of the characters are memorable. Some characters experience substantial development over the course of merely 3 episodes while others leave a strong emotional impact on you in just one. Since memories are given physical forms. the show easily portrays the characters&#039; feelings and emotions in enthralling ways. The female heroine experiences internal conflict that is well presented and the motives of some of the characters are made believable due to the conditions of their upbringing.<br />
<br />
The most distinct feature of Kaiba is its cartoonish art-style which gives characters an innocent look that acts as a profound contrast to the cruel world they live in. Despite the characters being well drawn with attention to detail, the backgrounds suffered from large inconsistencies to the point where it was difficult to tell what was being shown. The animation was smooth for the most part and suffered from insignificant faults. The beauty and fluidity were most noticeable during action scenes in the last few episodes.<br />
<br />
Kaiba&#039;s soundtrack is one of the best I heard. Not only is it mesmerizing on its own, but each track played was depicting the scene being shown. It made the sad scenes tragic, the happy scenes joyful and the tense scenes intense. The overall tone of the show is sad and naturally the same goes for the soundtrack. Some of the OST uses vocals that provide more emotional depth and meaning to the music. I wasn&#039;t very impressed by the OP and ED during my first listen; but as I watched more of the anime and comprehended the messages of the narrative, I took meaning to the lyrics of these songs and they grew on me.<br />
<br />
Even though the first 2 episodes didn&#039;t pull me in, the rest of the anime was a marvelous journey. The episodic stories during the first half are indelible pieces of suffering. Only to be followed by a roller coaster of revelations and plot twists that kept me on the edge of my seat.<br />
<br />
Kaiba is great. The concept of memories is used in many narratives but rarely does it succeed like it did in Kaiba. In 12 episodes, it managed to tell an emotionally impactful story about love and memories in an unfair world. It was an innovative experience that won&#039;t be forgotten. It is a great addition to my memories. It is a great addition to me. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for taking the time to read.

    Great works of art are not easy to review. They are not common like the cesspool of bad art. Bad art is easy to deconstruct, to show how pathetically horrible they are. “So bad it’s good” exists because these works are so bizarre, so extraordinary that they become unique. Bad art is never unique its badness. In contrast, great works of art always end up redefining what ‘good’ is, so any review of a masterpiece will never be analytical and conclusive. It always end up chasing something that we can only grasp a piece of, like a poet looking at a beautiful line he wrote

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249592">
        and knowing he can never write a worthy poem of it.<br />
<br />
Kaiba is one of those artworks. I say it deliberately. Judgment of it is not confined to anime. It transcends media, reaches something so deeply human and awe-inspiring that it becomes a part of you. Do not expect a rational explanation of why this anime is better than pretty much anything. If we understood completely why it’s so good, we’d have masterpiece dropping from the skies. I can try, though.<br />
<br />
The key to understanding Kaiba is understanding how it tells a story, specifically how it takes advantage of the personal nature of fiction. All art, including fiction, is personal. It is a product of human thought, a translation of your entire Being – your experiences, philosophy, unconscious, passions – into some kind of experience that another being can take on. Kaiba is a ridiculously expressive work. Every scene is imbued with emotion. Every object says something about what it represents. It’s so emotionally draining because of that.<br />
<br />
Memory is the big topic, but Kaiba isn’t just about memory. In a cliched way, it’s existentialist, asking what we are. Its answer is memories, but memories are also information. The anime explores this intersection of information that defines us. Notice the symbols. When memory isn’t converted to information, it is organic and free – it is lifelike memory eggs. These are also tiny, fragile and fleeting. The memories float away and are easily lost.<br />
<br />
The roe is us, so they use to show how tiny we are when death strikes. When a character dies, their bodies become liquid and vanish completely. The ‘self’ becomes just a bunch of yellow pieces floating way. It expresses the loss of death, how death completely erase us and we become nothing. The memory chip – a drill-like thing – can also die so easily, if it’s lost it’s gone forever. Sure, we can try to capture those roe or to protect the chip, but it’s so difficult. It’s an expression of how fragile we are.<br />
<br />
Yet converting ourselves into information makes us so much easier to control, and easier for us to control others. Altering other people’s memories is a sci-fi trope, but this anime is concerned with how it affects everyone, how it affects our personal lives. We see the small results of this – how erasing someone’s childhood erases who they are and they end up becoming nothing but a memory. How this power to change personal reality blurs into thinking we can change reality itself – a direct link to megalomania and tyranny.<br />
<br />
Our memories are our personality. Once we control them, edit them, change them all lines break down. The world of Kaiba looks funny by design, but that’s because how the people experience it. People can also put their memories into a whole new body. In one episode this results in a world where bodies are manufactured like clothes. Its reality is grotesque, a mass of weird shapes that’s disorientating. Somehow we ended up creating a more chaotic reality than nature.<br />
<br />
Leaning towards a socioeconomic critique of society, the anime shows a world in which memories – selves – become products. So a character sells her own body with hopes that her memory will be kept. Selves are no longer precious. This society isn’t painted with strokes of black to show you how evil rich people are. Rather, to illustrate the chaos of it, we see selling your own body and putting yourself in a chip is no guarantee. You’re relinquishing control of yourself, your grip on the world.<br />
<br />
Yet this ‘information’ is never just ‘information’. Consciousness was the result of accumalating all these pieces of data and connecting them. So we’re never really dead, and using memories this way is using people as objects. The anime is deeply concerned with living things. In a gallery of memories, the people who own these memories cry out to be released.<br />
<br />
Everyone’s concerns are always personal. Although the characters are simple, they have motivation and a humanity. A sheriff who really wants a girl at first seems like a greedy bastard, but he’s a person. That’s his wants, and when we see this want doesn’t make him just an asshole but a good person we’re encouraged to sympathize with him. In the end, he’s a ‘human’ being – with people he loves, things he wants, and dreams lost when death comes.<br />
<br />
Although there are antagonists, the series always reminds us that they’re people in the most simple way. People want power, but not because they’re evil. They want it because they’re human beings, so we see the ringleader of the resistance crumbling to tears when he realizes what he’s done. He had to erase memories that painted him in a bad light, but the result was losing a friend.<br />
<br />
This anime is in the end about treasuring people. The idea of memory is just a tool to show us how we can lose people, no matter how hard we work to keep them. We put their identity, their whole being in a chip but then that chip is lost. We sell a loved one’s body, hoping the salesman will keep the information in a chip. A friend blocks our ambition, so we erase some memories only to realize the whole person is gone. Eventually this anime reaches an important conclusion about being – we need each other, we’re social animals, power doens’t make up for it.<br />
<br />
The castle of Warp is a lonely place. The only person he has is an all-seeing robot. He’s not happy and the only thing he can talk about are who to execute. He may be the king of memories, but these are his own memories. What good are they? In a beautiful scene Popo and the resistance at the palace, and it has a huge opening to a black void. That’s the height of power to you, a lonely high place looking out into nothing. The only thing that’s there are themselves, yet they’re craving control.<br />
<br />
The romance between Neiro and Kaiba isn’t a symbol for romance, but what’s really important – connection. Even during oppression, they found something of their own, a precious shared memory that’s enough. Separate yourself from the struggle for power. The privileges of the rich to put themselves in memory chips and live forever aren’t that worthwhile in the end. Every world touched by this is grotesque, people are lost yet they are still people.<br />
<br />
You cannot talk about the art without mentioning the Neverhood, which seems like a direct inspiration for the anime. Both endings and beginning borrow from it. It opens with a man seeing an unknown, bizarre world. The ending includes a darker version of the hero and a gigantic, self-sacrificing robot. Like the Neverhood, the design is cartoonish, nonsensical and imbued with meaning and emotions. Look at the planet where the only thing that matters is the story of two old people. The planet itself is nothing but their tower. The underworld is almost colorless – but almost, since it still has some life in it. The club is colorful and weird but has a dominating shade of purple – a disorientating effect. Vanilla looks like what we expect from an asshole with the fat belly and aggressive face (Only his character later proves to be more). There is even a creature who flies by a propeller and doesn’t speak – like the sidekick from old video games. It’s as unrealistic as you get, but no scene is without emotional overtones just like life – and that makes it far closer to reality than anything else.<br />
<br />
Likewise the soundtrack couldn’t be better, a collection of gentle electronic sounds. It fits with the slightly childish designs, but it has the same fragility of the world. A lot of it sounds like Boards of Canada, only it takes it to less nostalgic tones. The soundtrack mostly expresses a reflective, introspective atmosphere, one of both awe and terror. Some tracks are colder and harsher that reminds us that this world is still harsh, a world where selves can be sold. Some tracks have beautiful, intimate melodies to go along with the theme of connection.<br />
<br />
There is no other anime like Kaiba, an anime so expressive, where every shot is charged with emotion, wonder, terror and humanity. ‘Depth’ isn’t the right word. It’s not an intellectual, symbolic exercise like Paranoia Agent or a psychological exploration like Digimon Tamers yet it’s somehow better than these two. Perhaps because it takes anime to the origin of art – the expression, not explanation, of human experience. Nothing I could write would do this anime justice.

    What is a human being? It&#039;s a collaboration of memories. Memories of yourself and memories of how others see you. When you destroy or change either of the aspects - the whole being changes.<br />
<br />
Kaiba is a story about memories, about memories that were lost, memories that were changed. About how good and bad memories are of equal importance.<br />
Humans strive to find a way to forget. Forget all the bad memories and leave the goods ones. But if we forget, doesn&#039;t it makes us less of what we are? Without bad experience we wouldn&#039;t be the same person.<br />
<br />
The world of Kaiba is one of dystopia. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review191257">
        poverty strikes harshly against the wealthiness. In this world the memories can be moved around. Deleted, copied, sold and bought. As well as bodies that lost all their memories. The rich ones may live forever by storing their memories in an expensive chip and moving it between bodies, while the poor ones either sell their memories or bodies for a hope of better tomorrow.<br />
<br />
The art style is... strange, to say the least. It&#039;s a minimalistic caricature in every aspects, from the character design to the world. It took me six episodes to finally get a grip on it and understand small aspects.<br />
The sound is great, the melodies are lovely and they kick in just in the right time to get you pumped or to crush your heart.<br />
<br />
This anime has no mercy. On several occasions it crushed my souls with how ruthless it is. There&#039;s no forgiveness. It took me by my heart and didn&#039;t let go until the last credits passed.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s one of the six titles out of almost three hundred watched that received a score of 10 from me. I always try very hard to evaluate the experience I gained with each title and the very last condition after getting a 9 is to have an ending that I liked. This one managed it, to my happiness.

    Kaiba is an experimental anime best known as being the brainchild of Yuasa Masaaki, who would later go on to direct The Tatami Galaxy and Ping Pong the Animation, two of the greatest works of the current decade of anime thus far. And Kaiba is undeniably in the same vein of brilliance as his later works. However, as impressive as Kaiba is, it&#039;s not as good as Tatami or Ping Pong - which is regrettable, because by all accounts it should have been just as exceptional as these two - if not better.<br />
<br />
I mean, it was certainly more amibitious than either of them, and those

          <span style="display: none;" id="review210507">
        two were plenty ambitious as it is. Where Tatami and Ping Pong were both highly eccentric coming-of-age stories, Kaiba is a highly eccentric dystopian high-concept sci-fi, revolving around the concept of a fictional universe in which memories are tangible, modifiable, and transferrable.<br />
<br />
The first thing you&#039;ll notice about Kaiba is that it is visually stunning. This extends far past the surrealistically cutesy character designs and bizarre environments - the animation is tremendously fluid, the visual design is a thing of awe, and the impressive and elaborate set-pieces are a great example of Masaaki&#039;s incredible talent as a director.<br />
<br />
The design isn&#039;t just a shallow aesthetic choice, either. The cutesy designs are a stark contrast to the dystopian setting, making the graphic nature of this series far more unsettling than it would have been given a more conventional presentation. The music is similar, in that it is a mix of creepiness and childlike innocence. The bizarre technology is a great part of Kaiba&#039;s aesthetic as well, with the vehicles, weaponry, and memory technology bearing a creative design that comes off as both high-conccept and cutesy at once.<br />
<br />
The early episodes are the series&#039; strongest, each of them an episodic vignette about the planet the episode is set on. These build excellent short stories that not only make for great worldbuilding, fleshing out a well-realized setting in which human lives are cheap and where memories are a commodity, but also create the kind of ethereal, atmospheric dreamscapes out of the setting that you can really lose yourself in.<br />
<br />
The problem with Kaiba arises when it becomes plot-driven in the latter half. While the core of it - a central character conflict between our three leads, Kaiba, Neiro, and Poppo - is very strong, it gets lost in a larger entanglement of numerous subplots revolving around minor characters that become impressively convoluted in a short span of time. There are an absurd number of twists regarding the identities and goals of characters before the plot even has time to make us invested in them. The viewer never has a chance to be grounded in what they are supposed to believe - it&#039;s hard to be surprised by a twist about a character you never knew from the start, and harder yet to understand why any character does what they do when their supposed motives and alliegiances will shift at the drop of a hat.<br />
<br />
But for a series with such a poorly-executed plot (and do keep in mind, this would be the death of almost any lesser series), Kaiba remains a remarkably impressive piece of work. The concept is brilliantly utilized, the setting is both engaging and entrancing, and the presentation is damn near peerless - perhaps rivalled only by Masaaki&#039;s later work. There&#039;s also some surprisingly strong characterisation in play here... not for the titular character, though, who is mostly a blank slate (which, to be fair, is used to great effect in the early episodes), but for Poppo, who is perhaps the only good example of a shift in motives in this series (and there are many). To elaborate too much on this would be to ruin it, but I will say that there&#039;s a certain scene in his backstory that evolves as the plot progresses, and this is combined with certain plot devices in a clever way that shows Masaaki&#039;s directing as nothing short of masterful.<br />
<br />
Final Words: Kaiba really is a unique, impressive series, and I&#039;d highly recommend it. But it is frustrating that it didn&#039;t live up to its full potential - perhaps if it were longer, it would have been able to fully flesh out its plot.<br />

    i really wanted to like kaiba. the art style is really incredible, and the world starts out interesting, but the further into it i got, the more problems i had with it. despite being a fan of masaki yuasa, i always get frustrated while watching shows that he directs because i dont think that writing strong characters or honestly, strong plots, is his strong suit. i had the same problems with this that i had with devilman crybaby, especially regarding character. most of the characters he writes are not developed very well or are just plain uninteresting, and just exist as vehicles to move the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330655">
        plot from point a to point b. devilman crybaby was a bit better, plot-wise it was very interesting, but that was because it had a fantastic source material to work with. imo his script writing just isn&#039;t great.<br />
<br />
i was also incredibly disappointed with the world building in this series, especially for a sci-fi show. during the first 2 episodes, i was really intrigued by their society, and for the first half, they did a pretty decent job of world building. despite being more episodic than i thought it would be, the animation stayed consistently good, and concept of being able to climb into another character&#039;s memory was enough to keep me into it. but honestly after the midway point of the series, i was kinda bored by it, and the ending turned into a standard we have to save the world plot, and by that point i was not at all invested anymore. it&#039;s a shame too, because this anime really does look fantastic. the technology is cool, the creatures are interesting and well designed, and the society they live in has so much potential.<br />
<br />
if kaiba wasn&#039;t rated so highly on here, i think id be less disappointed, but it&#039;s been on my list forever and i was very excited to watch it. i honestly think that it&#039;s a bit overrated based on all the reviews and forum posts i&#039;ve read. i understand people being into this show and enjoying it, but overall, i thought it was just okay.

    One of the most distressing things about some anime is their inability to use to its fullest potential many of the interesting ideas that they come up with. Some get bogged down in trying to appeal to as many people as possible or by just abandoning originality in favour of playing it safe by ripping off other successful shows and characters. But with Kaiba its a little different,  the show had some interesting original ideas, art and characters and was definitely not try to appeal to a mainstream audience but it too failed to reach its full potential and become some thing truly great

          <span style="display: none;" id="review63507">
        but it was for a number of different reasons than what happens to most other anime, but I&#039;ll get into that later... <br />
<br />
The basic premise of Kaiba is the story of a young boy who wakes up possessing no memories, and his only possession is a locket with a picture of a girl, and a hole in his chest. He then goes on a journey throughout the highly sensationalised and Dr Seuss style world of this anime while diving into a complex look at human nature, class warfare and the dangers of technology.<br />
<br />
Now to start off I would like to say that one of the reasons I enjoyed Kaiba was because it was not afraid to take risks, so many anime these days are terrified to do anything different with their art or story that we end up with generic rip off&#039;s and so many anime`s set in schools and rom-coms that its gotten ridiculous . While not revolutionary this anime did take some big risks at a time when studio companies are only concerned with one word “moe” and for that I was very grateful and pleased to see that originality still exists.<br />
<br />
The story in Kaiba while interesting, is probably its biggest flaw, not because it’s a bad story, not at all, in fact some of the ideas are very interesting to watch and think about. such as the idea of memory chips which can store people memory&#039;s and allow the switching of bodies, this has led to a way to cheat death and allow people (who can afford it) to get their dream bodies. But as with anything new and revolutionary it has its dark side, with people being forced to sell their bodies (literally) for money and even body stealing and collecting. Really at its core that’s what this anime is really about, showing us the dark side of human nature and the horrible things we’re capable of. But this is where the problems come in, while kaiba has some interesting ideas their not developed enough for us to become enthralled with them and most importantly they are not explained enough, so let me explain...<br />
<br />
Now id like to think of myself as someone with at least average intelligence and I don&#039;t need every little thing explained to me, in fact it can be more interesting when you have to use your imagination to fill in the blanks, but for fucks sake nothing was explained or made any sense in this anime. To be truthful it felt like the makers said “okay lets create a really trippy world that will show people the evils of human nature and will make them think while tugging at their emotions” and they did this really well, but then tacked on a half backed plot with some under developed characters at the end without much thought or real effort, the truth is this story and characters felt rushed and not thought out probably because it was rushed and not thought out. Had Kaiba been just an exploration of the world, rather than focusing so much on the plot in the second half then this series could have been a real gem to watch. Its possible to create an anime that just focuses on the spectacle rather than the characters or story and when you do something like that then its okay if a lot of things are left unexplained because we are just along for the ride but when you try to tell a complicated story and give characters some real depth then you have to at least get the basics straight other wise we cant get invested or relate to the characters because nothing makes sense. This is the main reason Kaiba failed to acheive its full potential, because time has taught us again and again that no amount of visuals, special effects or cool characters can replace a good, intersting, logical story ( take the hint Micheal Bay!) and without this everything is just wasted because a story brings together all the other elements. &quot;A special effect is just a tool, a means of telling a story, a special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing.&quot;-George Lucas. (before he became a sell out.) <br />
<br />
Anyway enough with the story the next thing to mention is the art. To say how good the art is feels a bit like flogging a dead horse at this point but to sum up what everyone has said is that its fantastic, very sensationalised and defiantly the strongest point of this show. But to say one thing that not many people mention is how the art is very clearly influenced by other materials from western animation and older shows rather than just coping the contemporary anime art styles, this was a nice touch and help give the show a fell of originality. <br />
<br />
The sound in Kaiba is perfect for what the show is trying to do, for the most part its subdued and kept in the background allowing us to feel what&#039;s happening without being to much in your face and manipulating. It not particlarly memorable but it certainly better than average and like the art seems to draw on a larger field of influence than most other animes. One thing that I noticed was that the music seemed to be very similar too or at least influenced by an old game called the Neverhood which I noticed a lot of this series seems to have drawn influence from. <br />
<br />
To conclude I would say that Kaiba is a perfect example of wasted potential and another chapter in the “what could have been great” book that the anime industry is currently writing. But even so I cant stress enough that this review is not a negative one, I just wanted to point out some of the problems to allow people to understand why a good series like this fails to achieve the level of greatness that it could have. Overall this series is a very good and interesting one that sucks you in and never lets go and you certainly wont forget about it for a very long time. While it didn&#039;t reach the heights it could have, Kaiba is still a welcome relief from the usual direction anime has been heading in for the past few years and is a must see for anyone looking for something a little different.

    Ah, first review, here we come! (There might be a few spoilers)<br />
<br />
Kaiba is not your typical anime. From the unorthodox way of animation, to the strange, confusing (but brilliant) storyline, it breaks the mold for anime you&#039;d probably typically watch. There are virtually no characters that fall into the groups of typical anime stereotypes (yandere, tsundere) and the anime introduces interesting sci-fi concepts that we probably could never imagine ourselves, which brings out the amazing originality of this piece of art (I mean anime).<br />
<br />
Kaiba&#039;s basic storyline starts off in a world where memories can be manipulated and swapped and bodies can be interchangeable, meaning you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25631">
        can freely delete bad memories and replace them with good ones, and implant them into another body. We find the main protagonist (Kaiba) inside a crumbling white room, with no memory of who he is or why he is there. Before he can ask any of these questions, he finds himself being chased by what seemed to be an over sized hairdryer. After narrowly escaping it, he embarks on the journey to regain his memories, traveling from many planets and meeting many people along the way.<br />
<br />
Story: 10<br />
The story was brilliantly laid out. From the beginning to the end, it Kaiba kept me hooked to my computer screen. The paciing was to the point of near perfection, letting us sympathize with Kaiba, while letting us view and immerse ourselves in his futuristic world. Bits of the plot are leaked out slowly, making you wonder what is happening and why, driving you to finish the series. Eventually though, all these pieces of the plot you&#039;ll find can interconnect, and the true brilliance of<br />
the story is revealed.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
It&#039;s like something out of a Salvador Dalli painting. The background environment is amazing and complex, with very interesting depictions of strange animals and fiery suns. Nearly everything is coloured for its situation, with poor places painted very dully and plain, whereas aquatic theme parks are bright with many hues of blue and yellow. The characters design, though different from what I&#039;d regularly see out of an anime, was still pleasing to the eye, as the characters seemed to be drawn more circularly. <br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
The OP and ED were very memorable (if not engrishy). Most of the background music enhanced the environment, and basically emulated the senses. Overall, the sound was very well done.<br />
<br />
Characters: 10<br />
This is probably the best part of this anime. All the characters have diverse personalities and goals, which gives each of them a strong sense of individuality.<br />
Sometimes, you&#039;ll have some misconceptions of some characters, take Popo. You first find him aiding Kaiba to the spaceship, giving him the sense that he is an ally. Then we find he is a member of the Issoudan, a group to kill the king of memories (really Kaiba, but Warp occupies the throne). Here we find he has traits of an arrogant and bloodthirsty antagonist, with no mercy to Kaiba/Warp or anyone who betrays the Issoudan. We only find in the  latter episodes his real intention in to find a body for the memories of his mother,  giving him sympathy and reasoning for his actions., putting him back in to his neutral stance, and renewing some sympathy for him.<br />
<br />
