    First of all, I decided to write a review for this movie because it left a strong impression on me, and not a pleasant one I might add. I am a big fan of One Piece and I especially like where and how the story is going in the manga and the anime series and that&#039;s why I was really anxious to watch this movie too, only to be wondering why have I even bothered after seeing as much as half of it. I really had high expectations from this one, especially with all the hype around it and all, even though the past movies

          <span style="display: none;" id="review28950">
        weren&#039;t anything special.  <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t wish to ruin anyone&#039;s enjoyment, that&#039;s why I will try to be as objective as possible and give all the arguments necessary for my score decisions.<br />

BUT LET ME WARN YOU, THIS IS A NEGATIVE REVIEW AND IT MAY CONTAIN SOME SMALL SPOILERS, SO DON&#039;T READ IT IF YOU KNOW IT MAY AFFECT YOUR VIEWING EXPERIENCE!<br />
<br />
STORY: The story is nonexistent. There is absolutely nothing in this that could be considered a story. The crew just beats the crap out of the bad guy saving the damsel in distress in the process and all for some cheap reason. When I say that the reason is not worthy to mention is because the viewer just doesn&#039;t seem to relate to the seriousness of the situation, mainly because we only HEAR about what the bad guy (Shiki) is going to do. There is almost NO VISUAL REPRESENTATION of the tragic that such a situation would represent, so the viewer remains unfazed emotionally most of the time. My score for the story is 3, yes you read it right, 3. All the hype about Eiichiro Oda being the one to write the script for this film I think it was mainly done for publicity reasons, as there is little substance to the actual story.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: The characters that we all love and adore are full of clicheistic behaviour and unnatural reactions. But let me elaborate a bit on what I mean. The Straw Hat crew seem to behave throughout the story mostly in repetitive ways from past series&#039; episodes. Now, this wouldn&#039;t necessarily be a bad thing if done with care and moderation, but here we just see this many behaviour patterns brought together from several different arcs from the anime series and mixed to form this &quot;thing&quot; that lacks substance. On the other side of the barricade, the bad guys are... well... just silly. I mean, Shiki is one bad dude, his power is awesome, I can&#039;t deny that. I was really surprised by it, but his personality is just demeaning for the &quot;legend&quot; that he is supposed to represent and his actions and his master plan are just at a kindergarten level. His crew is stupid, and I mean stupid... There is no way such a crew could ever pose any threat to anyone, especially Gol D. Roger. They&#039;re not scary, they&#039;re not smart, they&#039;re not powerful and they&#039;re not even funny... especially funny. The jokes are terrible. And not only their jokes, but the jokes throughout the hole movie. They&#039;re really D grade material. The only thing that really stands out about the characters is the clothes they wear. Now, I don&#039;t dislike them, they&#039;re pretty cool, but I think this is mainly for the fanservice and the publicity and don&#039;t really fit well with the adventurous atmosphere that the One Piece world should have. So... for the characters I think a score of 4 is just about right. There are some good points but too few to make a difference. The not so good points just seem to overwhelm everything...<br />
<br />
ANIMATION: The animation, at first really blowed me away, but slowly started to seem less and less attractive. The opening and the first part of the anime has astonishing graphics, wonderful views with top notch computer finishes. The battles are also very beautifully animated and really give a sense of awesomeness. But... yes... there is a but here too... There are some sequences where the animation just seems rushed and others where it seems plain. Not many I might add, but it still adds this feeling of inconsistency throughout the movie. Talking about inconsistency, the pace is very uneven. Either a fast pace is invoked or a slow one and they don&#039;t really transition smoothly between one to another. So, for the animation, I think an 8 is appropriate, and yes, I don&#039;t think I&#039;m being generous. This is probably a fair score.<br />
<br />
SOUND: Now... here you will find a problem. One of the first thing you may notice is that there is NO SOUND... yes, you heard me correctly... NO SOUND. And when I say this I mean there is no music through much of the film. The music is the most important thing when one wants to create an atmosphere suitable for the different situations that arise. And this movie lacks everything when it comes to atmosphere, and mainly because of the music. I was really disappointed by this. The characters&#039; voices are pretty decent... the ones&#039; everyone&#039;s already familiar with, so no problem here, although there isn&#039;t really much dialogue to be found. So for the sound, another 3, and now I&#039;m being generous...<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: I was really flustered about my expectations from this movie and it&#039;s real value. So, while I can&#039;t say I didn&#039;t enjoy it I can&#039;t say I felt any kind of satisfaction either. More like dissatisfaction. So... for the enjoyment, let&#039;s say... 4 will do.<br />
<br />
RECOMMENDATION: If you&#039;re a One Piece fan, watch it. Also, if you&#039;re age is not greater than 12 you&#039;ll probably find it cool. Otherwise don&#039;t waste your time with it.<br />
<br />
OVERALL my score is 4. Now, I don&#039;t know, maybe I was in a bad mood when I watched it and it deserves more, so don&#039;t go screaming your eyes out at me. If you disagree with me then I&#039;m really happy for you, because the time you spent watching this film was enjoyable and it probably became a happy memorable experience for you.

    One Piece: Strong World is, indeed, a great movie. If you like the anime, you should watch this. You&#039;ll probably love it. Now, about my ratings:<br />
<br />
Story (9): The story is great. I suppose they couldn&#039;t do more in just one movie. The Strong World: Episode 0 OVA helped buying a lot of time. Like in any One Piece arc, the story moves fastly, no matter what has been shown before. <br />
<br />
Art (9): Once you watch One Piece (anime) and see how the art isn&#039;t that good in many parts of the series, you&#039;ll notice that this movie contains a great art. Like, Franky had a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review28995">
        banana on his hair. What the hell is that? Brooke was smoking. Well, I liked it and all, but the clothes were strange, and I have to admit it. Anyway. Great art and this is it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound(9): The sound is great, but it has nothing &quot;unexpected&quot;. New soundtrack, but once it&#039;s a movie, it had to be like this. The voices were great (duh) like on the anime. <br />
<br />
<br />
Character(10): Luffy&#039;s crew is so original that I can&#039;t give it less than 10. Their personalities, the clothes they were wearing (strange, but original)... Shiki was, as well, an outstanding character. I have nothing bad to add about the characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoymen(9)t: If you like One Piece and you aren&#039;t expecting a lot of this movie just because Oda wrote this, then you&#039;ll love this movie and even give it a 10. The key is: Don&#039;t overrate it.<br />
<br />
Overall(9): Well, many may not agree with me and rate this movie with a 10. But in a general analysis, 9 is a great note for this movie. All of the terms were combined and this is what we got: 9. The absence of logic in some parts (once I may not write spoilers, I&#039;m not telling which parts these are), besides One Piece lacks logic on the anime itself many times, makes me feel like if this movie deserves a 9.<br />
<br />

    One Piece needs no introduction. It&#039;s one of those franchises that everyone&#039;s heard of, even people who don&#039;t watch anime. It&#039;s also one I haven&#039;t seen a whole lot of. I stopped watching after about a dozen episodes because it didn&#039;t interest me and Mr. Fantastic&#039;s brain dead son was absolutely unbearable as a character. I might have watched more if he hadn&#039;t been the main protagonist. Why am I bringing this up? Because I received a request to review one of the movies. You might ask how I can review it when I haven&#039;t watched most of the series, but it&#039;s pretty simple. It&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review77479">
        a movie. It&#039;s not an episode, it&#039;s a movie. Here&#039;s the thing about movies, they have to be able to stand alone. Even most film trilogy parts can stand by themselves and still make sense. So, if it&#039;s even halfway decently written, I should have no trouble figuring out what&#039;s going on or reviewing it. I may have trouble dealing with Stretch Armstrong&#039;s imbecilic cousin, but that&#039;s a completely different matter. So, let&#039;s take a look at One Piece: Strong World and hope that that stretchy moron dies a painful death. <br />
<br />
We open with ships floating in the sky. We cut to a pirate who causes them to fall on a group of government ships. We then cut to silly putty brain and his crew wandering around on a floating island. Why? Well the film quickly moves into a flashback to show a pirate named Shiki, the same guy who made the boats float, trick elongated man&#039;s paint chip eating roommate and his crew into crashing on the island so he can kidnap Nami. What&#039;s the point of showing the events out of order? I have no idea, it doesn&#039;t make sense. There&#039;s no story reason for this structure nor does it create tension. Anyway, Shiki wants Nami to join his crew because he needs a good navigator so that he can take over the world. Okay, so the story is pretty cliche. How&#039;s the execution? Well, the first issue is that Shiki isn&#039;t even remotely threatening. He has sword legs which just look stupid and shouldn&#039;t be functional. Swords, they don&#039;t work that way. He also looks like the love child of Jay Leno and Kraven the hunter, making him very difficult to take seriously. Then there&#039;s his crew, which consists of a clown who wears shoes that make fart sounds, a pink gorilla and a bunch of nameless henchmen. I&#039;ve seen more menacing villains in the Care Bears. Maybe they&#039;re trying to be funny, but there&#039;s not a lot of humour here. There were all of two funny scenes. Another thing that really bugs me is that they use the term &quot;Evolution&quot; when what they mean is mutation. Science, how does it work?<br />
<br />
The characters are pretty one-dimensional. Let&#039;s be generous and say that they&#039;re relying on us knowing them from the show. But those characters who I remember from what little I&#039;ve seen of the show haven&#039;t changed, except for their outfits. Rousai&#039;s disappointing grandson is still an obnoxious moron and the rest of the cast is pretty under-developed and bland. <br />
<br />
The art... I don&#039;t even know where to start. I have to admit that I hate the art in One Piece. The mostly lidless and blank eyes, the mouths that always seem to have their teeth showing for no reason, the bizarre proportions, the random things that replace various body parts. I will give the film credit though, most of the fight scenes do look pretty cool. <br />
<br />
The voice acting is okay. I really can&#039;t stand Tanaka Mayumi&#039;s performance, although I don&#039;t really blame her since I know she can act. It&#039;s probably the direction. The rest of the voice actors do a decent job albeit exaggerated a times. The strongest performances are probably from Cho and Okamura Akemi. The music is pretty underwhelming and forgettable. <br />
<br />
The yuri factor is a 1/10. There isn&#039;t any in this. <br />
<br />
So, how does Strong World fare? It&#039;s not that bad. The story is pretty stupid, Elastic girl&#039;s brain damaged admirer is the worst aspect and the weak antagonists don&#039;t help matters. To the film&#039;s credit, the fight scenes are pretty good and a lot of it does fall into the &quot;so stupid it&#039;s funny category.&quot; So, I&#039;m going to give it a 4/10.

    Considering Oda&#039;s supposed contribution to this movie, it was pretty disappointing. Note that Shiki&#039;s abilities and some other things are spoiled in this review just since it&#039;s hard to talk about the movie without spoiling it, but... ah, who cares? The movie was predictable, anyway.<br />
<br />
I simply couldn&#039;t think of the story as being more than filler. I know they tried to make it &quot;tie into&quot; the main story, but I simply wasn&#039;t convinced. They added this magical &quot;Shiki&quot; character who escaped Impel Down! That place has such tight security that NOBODY HAS EVER broken into or out of it until Luffy managed to. Oh... wait,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35595">
        there was that one other guy who did it, how could we forget? What&#039;s more, he was Gol D. Roger&#039;s hugest rival and controlled a fleet of incredible proportions. What&#039;s even more, the news of his escape from Impel Down was broadcast to the entire world in the newspaper headlines, so EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT THIS GUY, and yet... he doesn&#039;t exist. He also destroyed Marineford before... He&#039;s like a hollow copy of Luffy&#039;s accomplishments for the sake of seeming like such a worthless character can be Luffy&#039;s rival. He&#039;s never mentioned in One Piece because he&#039;s nothing more than a character hastily inserted into the anime series in some weak attempt to create substance for the movie. <br />
But okay, let&#039;s move on, shall we? This guy&#039;s been doing big things like making islands float and rampaging around East Blue (which shall hereby be forgotten by everyone). This is really quite horrible, so the Straw Hat Pirates decide to put their great adventure on hold. That&#039;s right, they&#039;re going to quickly sail back to where they started so they can save East Blue. That would surely take WEEKS or MONTHS, but don&#039;t worry! They&#039;ll surely make it back in time to save their hometowns. And they&#039;ll find some way to go back up the Reverse Mountain. Hey, I guess Brook can say hi to Laboon, going against his promise to circumnavigate the globe to see Laboon again. Seriously, the story was shit. It wasn&#039;t planned out at all and does NOT tie in with the main story in any way at all. By the way, this is only the introduction to set the stage; the movie&#039;s barely begun. <br />
<br />
To me, it felt like the movie was trying very hard to be like &quot;One Piece&quot;. The comedy was just pretty typical and didn&#039;t make me laugh. The &quot;YOU CAN TALK?!&quot; joke didn&#039;t really make sense seeing as everyone knows the guy can talk, though I found it slightly amusing. The final stage of that running gag was pretty decent, but overall I think it was a bad idea to try and stick a running gag into a single movie. There just isn&#039;t enough time to make the viewers familiar with it unless you throw it in their faces at every opportunity like they did in this movie. The bird and the electrocution humour felt like a copy of Pikachu from Pokemon. <br />
<br />
The characters were... in character. Their costumes for the movie were fan service. They looked cool, there&#039;s no denying that. Shiki and his crew were made up entirely of complete morons. They also felt like a forced attempt to emulate &quot;One Piece&quot; - the three main villains were given very blatant quirks. One Piece often does a good job of making each character unique, like how Don Flamingo is always laughing and scheming, how Jinbei is honourable and self-sacrificing, how Zoro can seem scary while actually being a really great guy. Shiki had a steering wheel in his head and his own special laugh, which just felt bland and made him look like a joke. His assistant&#039;s shoes made fart noises and he had his running gag; the fart noise thing just felt really, really stupid. The gorilla dressed oddly and seemed to have a King Kong mindset or something. The characters had no depth; there was nothing to them beyond the quirks.<br />
<br />
Shiki&#039;s power was kinda nonsensical. I can accept the floating stuff, but his special moves just didn&#039;t relate to that at all. When the Straw Hats fight him, the results are just kinda typical... like they want us to think &quot;Wow, Shiki is so amazing and is not a guy to be messed with&quot;. I could feel that way about God Enel, but Shiki did nothing to earn a reputation like that. He just did some move that made no sense and everyone was suddenly too slow to do anything. I can&#039;t accept that, even if Luffy was hungry. <br />
<br />
<br />
After thinking about it all, I think I rated this movie too high. The only good One Piece movie is the one where Chopper joins their crew... But it isn&#039;t good because it&#039;s a movie, it&#039;s good because Oda actually wrote that story and it was really touching; it was touching in the series. All of the movies are mere merchandise created to generate more money by throwing the &quot;One Piece&quot; name all over the place. If you&#039;re an extremely hardcore fanboy or if you can&#039;t tell good anime from bad anime, then this is the movie for you. One Piece has a good story, but you should just stick to the manga if you&#039;re tired of fillers and empty movies like this one.

    Honestly, I like keeping my reviews short since most people just skim through these things (like myself) and have pretty short attention spans, but just this once I&#039;d like to make it somewhat longer.<br />
<br />
Strongworld. This One Piece movie has a fitting name. It takes place in an island where only the strong survive, literally. Movie # 10, I enjoyed every bit of it since I knew it would be good. Why?  Eiichiro Oda had a hand in its making. Why? To celebrate the 10 year anniversary of One Piece silly.  <br />
<br />
Anyways... where should I start... <br />
<br />
Story: (10)<br />
The story is refreshing and creative. Assuming

          <span style="display: none;" id="review28903">
        the person who watches this is up the latter episodes  (400+) sooner or later you&#039;ll hear about an infamous pirate named Shiki. I believe he first makes his appearance on episode 425 so be sure to check that out or rewatch it. Long story short, Luffy eventually crosses paths with him and trouble abrupts. <br />
<br />
Art: (10)<br />
One word: Incredible. I was in awe the entire time I was watching the movie, it was just absolutely ridiculous. One piece has evolved and continues to ever year.<br />
<br />
Characters: (10)<br />
I&#039;ll start and end with the ladies. Nami, the fashion queen, had some pretty outrageous clothing in this movie. All of them had one thing in common: Sexy. Robin was also incredibly cute. Her main outfit in the movie consisted of  wearing glasses with a long, green and white striped shirt. These were the only ones that really stood out to me. Overall, the change in attire for the cast was refreshing.<br />
<br />
The characters you should look forward to in this movie are: Sanji, Luffy, and possibly Brook. Sanji and Brook had a multitude of funny moments. They deliver the brunt of the comedy. As always, Luffy was pretty epic. In just this one movie, he literally gained 2000 cool points from me. Basically, he&#039;s accumulated over 9000 through the course of the series. <br />
<br />
Overall, BEST ONE PIECE MOVIE EVER, PERIOD.

    This is an anime of forced gags, less awful than usual but still average animation and art, and really bad action. The main point of the movie seems to actually be to debut Nami, now with bigger tits than ever and &quot;cuter&quot;, rounder anime eyes than ever. &quot;Growing up&quot; is one matter, but this has really spiraled out of control.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem with the movie is that the action is interrupted by humor over and over, but the humor is terrible which leads to a very messy progression. When you have the same &quot;YOU CAN TALK???&quot; joke 4 different times, even by Shiki multiple times,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31901">
        then how can someone throw themselves into this movie with full enjoyment?<br />
<br />
The next biggest problem with this movie is the character Shiki. He comes across like a much less interesting version of Blackbeard, and since the plot essentially revolves around him being rude the whole time, it wears really thin to have to endure him over and over.<br />
<br />
Could the &quot;rescue a nakama!!!!1&quot; plot idea be any more overused in this series by now? Did we really need an entire movie about it? I actually laughed when Nami was all &quot;if only we had known the terrible mistake we made...&quot; or something narrating a backstory, only for it to be like A DAY AGO...well gee, you sure went through a lot there!<br />
<br />
The battles did not really make sense...Shiki toys with them with his gravity power early on, then later Luffy powers up to gear second and can suddenly fend off pretty much everything. Well, way to undermine the entire movie? The outfits and attitudes going into the &quot;climactic battle&quot; were even worse...<br />
<br />
Honestly, everyone just decided this would have to be great because Oda was involved, then when it was not actually so great...well who cares, Oda made it! It had to have been great, who am I to judge this! -_- The only part of One Piece with any integrity left is the manga.<br />
<br />
I will say that the power idea they gave Shiki was a perfectly nice and enjoyable idea, and when it was just him messing around with gravity was when this movie was at its most fun.

    When the next OP moviie was announced I had mixed opinions. The movies have always been enjoyable and recently have been going back to remaking some of the classic arcs with a bit of new goodness. However when I learned the original creator Eiichiro Oda would be heading the project, I squealed like a school girl. So, after waiting about 8 months the movie has finally been subbed and I watched it today. Does Oda&#039;s canon movie triumpth over the original and remade story lines of the other movies? Let&#039;s tackle this movie.<br />
<br />
Plot: Surprisingly the plot is the toughest thing to talk about IMO. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review28962">
        plot isn&#039;t bad, oh hell no it&#039;s great. It&#039;s just a bit of an old tune  from an Oda plot line. As other people have stated, the plotline works a lot like the Arlong arc. Actually... you might as well say IT IS the Arlong arc. Nami gets kidnapped by crazed villian (Shiki in our case), Luffy and crew go to save her. Shiki tries to make Nami his navigator and plans to control the entire ocean starting with the East Blue.  Luffy and crew have to rescue her and protect their homeland by beating Shiki and saving everything. Yadda yadda yadda. Point is, it&#039;s a new location with new characters, but it has the general idea the Arlong arc brought up, but on a higher scale. I enjoyed the arc so I really had no problems.<br />
<br />
Art: Damn. I can&#039;t say anything more than that. The characters, the islands, even just looking at all the stuff in the scenery is just amazing. Fluent animations mixed in with some of those wacky expressions that OP fans have grown to love. One of my favorite works of art in the movie has to be near the end, with the snow falling in a night sky while all the battles are going on. Also just to add in, the character costumes look cool as hell. I mainly love Chopper&#039;s. I thought he couldn&#039;t get any cuter but I guess I was wrong.<br />
<br />
Sound: All the Seiyuu&#039;s work their roles perfectly. One Piece has lots and lots of communications between the crew mates. Which really means that you get to hear perfect chemistry between the characters voices. The new characters voices are also very good. Shiki and Indigo&#039;s conversations are just hilarious, and it just reminds you how good classic comedy duo&#039;s can be, especially with each of their reactions. The seiyuu&#039;s did a great job. For the music I can also say, it was great. You get your mix of peaceful melodies, crazy fast paced music, and of course, roaring battle music. Every piece of sound works in it&#039;s place, and just adds more on to the scenes.<br />
<br />
Character: Oda never fails when it comes to characters. The Strawhats are all here and enjoyable as ever. You get your Zoro and Sanji bickering,  Brook&#039;s bone jokes, and of course Luffy&#039;s goofy laugh and enjoyable personality. When it came to the action too, same thing. The characters in battle resembled how they were in the series, the same feeling for fights and just the same atmosphere. Though one thing I did find a bit annoying was Nami played the damsel in distress role. Which she can really kick ass, so it&#039;s a bit of a shame to see her not really doing much fighting, but her scenes with Shiki work out great. <br />
<br />
Speaking of Shiki he&#039;s also a very enjoyable character. He has the quirks of many OP villians, and his devil fruit power is very cool. I also like how they develop him first as a good guy, but later turns out to be a real asshole. Adds on to his deceitful character. His crew is also very enjoyable. Despite that only two members really shined, Indigo and the gorilla. Indigo was a comical relief and did a great job of it with his comedy lines with the others. The gorilla on the other hand, didn&#039;t really do that much. He was just kind of there with the intent of &quot;If I&#039;m here than maybe someone can use their signature moves on me.&quot; Least what it looked like to me.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: As a OP fan, I loved the living hell out of this movie. I always love seeing the Strawhats on the big screen ( Or just HDTV screen in my taste) and watching them go at it in a crazy movie like this. You have enjoyable new characters, crazy animals (Oda really knows how to combine random things with animals), beautiful artwork, and a fantastic world that the movie takes place in. It&#039;s got your comedy, drama, and of course, action as all OP fans would expect. Also, Luffy does a seriously badass move at the end of it, I was just in awe as it happened like &quot;Oda, you&#039;ve done it again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Overall: As the description says it does take place later on in the series. But honestly, even if I never saw One Piece before I would love this movie. It&#039;s enjoyable for everyone but the fans will go to town with this movie. It just shows, when you put the creator behind the wheel of the movie, this is how it goes. A fantastic movie, and it makes absolute sense why it was a box office smash in Japan.

    I generally do not like Japanese anime movies based off long-running shonen anime series, because they are pretty much just long fillers. So finding out that the creator of One Piece, Eiichiro Oda, was the executive producer of the then upcoming One Piece film, One Piece: Strong World, got me interested in it. I still figured that it would be a filler movie, but I was wondering whether Oda&#039;s involvement in the movie would make it more enjoyable or not. I am pleased to say that it did.<br />
<br />
<br />
(Story -- 5) <br />
Though the story is pretty much your typical shonen anime movie story, it does have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37166">
        a bit more substance to it. This is due to the fact that Oda wrote the story, and that it is considered canon.  Even so, I do still think that the movie could have had a much better and entertaining story. But it is fair to note that shonen anime movies are usually watched by fans to see their favorite anime characters in high quality animation and not necessarily to see the story.<br />
<br />
(Art -- 10)<br />
The art and animation did not leave anything to be desired. The animation was very smooth, and the art was colorful and fitting. Compared to the first season of One Piece (which practically had still images for most of the runtime), I felt like this one was on steroids. I also felt that they finally achieved the &#039;atmosphere&#039; which the manga evokes. Everything on screen was really lively, especially Luffy and his devil fruit abilities. In addition, I like Oda&#039;s animal designs immensely.<br />
<br />
(Sound -- 7)<br />
The movie had a couple of new tunes in it, which I thought were good. The sound effects were practically the same ones used in the show; therefore, they were nothing new or amazing. A couple of times, the lip syncing seemed off to me.<br />
<br />
(Character -- 9)<br />
The characters are at their best in this film. In previous movies, the characters seemed rather repetitive and boring, and it felt like the movie makers just took the running gags from the manga and placed them into the films. One Piece: Strong World made the characters surprisingly humorous and life-like -- even the villains made me chuckle now and then with their humor that definitely belonged to Oda. I feel that he added a breath of fresh air to the dying movie versions of his characters. But even though I felt that most of the characters were done well, I did not enjoy the new, movie-exclusive characters Billy and Xiao. I felt that they were way to stereotypical for their own good and just plain bland. Xiao (a little girl who requires the help of the Straw Hat Pirates) made me laugh only once at a gag that seemed to parody child characters in previous One Piece films.<br />
<br />
(Enjoyment -- 9)<br />
A slightly more captivating story, a more noticeable soundtrack, and the exclusion of a couple of movie-only characters could have made me give One Piece: Strong World full marks. As such, Even though, I still very much enjoyed this film.<br />
<br />
(Overall -- 8)<br />
In my opinion, One Piece: Strong World is definitely the best One Piece film, and is overall a very decent shonen anime movie. Any fan of One Piece should watch it, even if they do not like the anime or previous movies.

    Up to this point, all of the One Piece movies have either been a big hit or a big miss. Then comes movie 10, Strong World. The big thing about this movie is that it&#039;s the first One Piece movie that is actually written and produced by creator Eiichiro Oda himself. So after finally watching it, does the movie surpass all expectations? Well, I&#039;m going to get to a little flack for this review because to be honest I don&#039;t believe this is the best of the One Piece movies, BUT that doesn&#039;t mean I find this movie bad. In fact, it&#039;s more of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review53427">
        opposite really.<br />
<br />
So let me just get something out of way that I don&#039;t even need to go into detail about. The animation and sound are perfect. Just absolutely perfect. The One Piece score is what you expect from the franchise and the animation is on a movie budget, so things on the technical side, flawless.<br />
<br />
Alright, so what&#039;s the story of Strong World. Well, first of all there are some things you must watch first before you watch this movie. For one thing, I would believe the only reason you are watching this movie in the first place is because you are a One Piece fan, but even if you are, you must&#039;ve first watched episodes 426-429. It reminds me of Star Trek 2 in a way, that you actually don&#039;t need to see the first Star Trek movie but rather an episode from the series. There is also an OVA prequel titled Strong World Ep 0 which is worth a watch but is not entirely necessary.<br />
<br />
In this movie, Luffy and the gang are drifting along as they normally do when they suddenly come across a floating island (not like Sky Island). They discover the reasoning behind this when they encounter the legendary pirate and user of the Float-Float Fruit Captain Shiki. Shiki then gains an interest in Nami&#039;s navigating skills and kidnaps her. Thus, in glorious traditional One Piece fashion, the Straw Hats go out of their way to save their navigator and stop the evil pirate lord Shiki.<br />
<br />
The story of Strong World is where the film falls flats for me. It&#039;s not a bad story, but for One Piece, to me this film does not catch the emotion and power that I have seen in the franchise before it, not mention it&#039;s very cliche. I mean the power is there, but it&#039;s not as powerful. If I were to give an analogy, I would say that the story of Strong World is like eating your favorite meal. A meal that wherever you go, you enjoy it no matter how it&#039;s made. Sometimes that meal is prepared bad, sometimes that meal is prepared great, and sometimes that meal has a new spin on it providing an unforgettable experience. Where am I going with this? If One Piece is one of my favorite meals, then Strong World would lie in the place where my meal was prepared great enough to make me want to have it again.<br />
<br />
Okay enough with the food analogies, what I am saying is, Strong World is a great movie and very welcomed addition to the One Piece franchise. It has the One Piece name to it and the One Piece characters we all know and love wearing suits and shooting guns...wait what? Okay so this is a nitpick, (Btw don&#039;t worry this is not a huge spoiler) but at the beginning of the third act the Strawhats crash a meeting, wearing suits, and start shooting with guns-a-blazing. I shouldn&#039;t be complaining as it is a badass scene plus Oda did write it in, but even for One Piece, this still bothers me because of the fact I would never EVER expect the Strawhats to make an entrance like this. Well, because  for one thing, IT&#039;S THE STRAWHATS IN SUITS WITH GUNS, but the beauty of all this is that being One Piece, I can let it slide.<br />
<br />
Overall, I highly recommend One Piece Strong World. Is it my favorite of the One Piece movies? No, but it ranks second. To be honest, all the One Piece movies, aside from movie 7, are pretty good. My favorite among them is movie 6 because it did something that caught my interest. It took One Piece into a different direction while keeping what make the series so great intact making it a much more interesting to watch and kind of what I expected out of this movie. Strong World, however, does what the other movies needed which was do what the TV series does best. Provide us with great characters and their devotion to each other conveying stories so powerful that it sends chills down your spine and could even shed a tear. Unfortunately, I only feel a little bit of that power from the series in Strong World, but that little bit of power is great enough to make this film a must watch.

    One Piece: Strong world is a glorious adventure! I really enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
They balanced a lot of great stuff well here. The side character plot of the feathered village folk was nice, and given just the right amount of time without any long flashbacks of their hardships, but enough for us to care. Nami really shined, and Shiki was a very solid villain, plus Luffy and the crew all had their cool moments. Good humor, good drama. And beautifully animated!<br />
<br />
And it was fun seeing the crew dressed all classy gangster style, and firing huge guns like in some of those Oda color pages, cool stuff.<br />
<br />

        couple nitpicks, one being Robin seemed to get the least time to shine out of everyone, always wanted more of her on there. Also, I would&#039;ve liked to see a longer more thorough glorious beatdown in the end, some of the fights were on the brief side.<br />
<br />
All in all, very satisfying, awesome film. Easily the best One Piece movie.

    This is the 10th movie for One Piece. Oda (the creator of One Piece) himself contributed to this movie, and it turned out fairly well. It has a lot of cool action scenes, the artwork is fantastic, and it&#039;s plot isn&#039;t bad at all. As far as One Piece movies go, this is the best one. They even integrated it into the Manga series, and they had a filler arc in the anime that helped integrate it as well.<br />
<br />
Though I give the series a 10 hands down, this isn&#039;t as good due to the time constraints of a movie. No story arc in One Piece

          <span style="display: none;" id="review85027">
        is told in this little amount of time, so it feels very rushed compared to it&#039;s normal baseline for story arcs. Really what drives this movie is the &quot;cool&quot; factor. You get to see the amazing Straw Hat Crew dress up in new outfits and kick a little but. It&#039;s worth watching, but it&#039;s not up to normal One Piece standards. That last comment aside, it&#039;s still the best movie, and it is still pretty good.<br />
<br />
If you haven&#039;t seen the One Piece series, then I wouldn&#039;t watch this yet. Like all movies based on anime series they skip the character development. It works in this movie because the characters have such strong and unique personalities that you get to know them very quickly, but this is a side story and the anime series is a flat out masterpiece.<br />
<br />
That aside, it&#039;s worth watching, and it has high repeat value.

    Story - Strong World to me seemed to feel like it was just a retelling of Skypeia with a new setting and different villains.  The whole concept is pretty similar. Although this movie is technically part of the overall OP story it feels very tacked on and contradictory to a few other parts of the plot (i.e. &quot;no one ever escaped from Impel Down..... oh yeah Shiki did&quot;).  <br />
<br />
Art - The animation looks crisp, flowing, and makes it very fun to watch.  The unique character outfits they used for this movie are IMO the best used so far in One Piece, which

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34021">
        is a nice touch.  The only thing I didn&#039;t care for was the character designs of the villains. Shiki looks kind of ridiculous with the two swords as prosthetic legs.<br />
<br />
Sound - The music in Strong World is amazing, honestly to the point where it can feel like a music video or an AMV at times, especially in the beginning.  The sound quality in general is a strength of this film on a totally different level than the show.  Voice acting as usual is superb.<br />
<br />
Character - It&#039;s One Piece, it would be hard for me not to give this one a 10 for obvious reasons.  While I didn&#039;t care for the designs of the bad guys in this that much, I thought they were at least decent characters as well, although they do get annoying a couple times.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - I&#039;ve already watched this a couple times and loved this movie.  I think it would also be a good thing to show someone to get them into the show, it would contain a few spoilers but it shows off the characters and combat of the show very well.  I feel it could be very enjoyable to people who have not seen much or any of the series.<br />
<br />
Overall - If you&#039;re a fan of the show I highly recommend this flick.  It&#039;s eye and ear candy at its finest.

    [[ this is my first review and I am not fluent in english so ... be patient pls ;-; ]]<br />
<br />
So, I watched this movie because after I said One Piece Film Z were awesome a friend of mine told me Strong World is the best One Piece Movie, and honestly I preferred the Z one, but that doesn&#039;t means Strong World is a bad movie, don&#039;t get me wrong, this movie is very good.<br />
<br />
<br />
[Story] - 7<br />
<br />
Oda&#039;s histories are always creative and full of adventures not difference with this one, but something I didn&#039;t like is the fact that nothing have an aprofundation, for example, we

          <span style="display: none;" id="review212104">
        know Shiki is a legendary pirate that in some time in the past confronted Gol D. Roger and lost, that he escaped Impel Down and that he could destroy everything... and that is it, nothing else, what is not usual in One Piece, where we are accustomed with every character has a great and long past that is very well worked, but I will let more for character review. I gave 7 because the story is good, but the sudden events could be more worked.<br />
<br />
<br />
[Art] - 9<br />
<br />
One pieces art is pretty peculiar but Strong World is beautiful, the colors are strong and the animation is very fluid (why don&#039;t 10 then? because I am boring)<br />
<br />
<br />
[Sound] - 7<br />
<br />
All that we love in the series music.<br />
<br />
<br />
[Character] - 7<br />
<br />
As I said before, the characters presented in the movie don&#039;t have a great presentation, and it doesn&#039;t applies only to Shiki, it&#039;s even worse with the others, but counting the fact it&#039;s a movie and the time is pretty short, I will give a discount.<br />
<br />
<br />
[Enjoyment] - 9<br />
<br />
Something I like in this movie is that is like watch an entire one piece arc but in like one and a half hour.<br />
<br />
<br />
[Overall] - 8<br />
<br />
Story is satisfatory, art is great, sound is ok, characters are not well worked but the film is good.

    This is the only One piece Movie that I have ever seen so far so I cannot really compare it to previous ones. After watching the anime my friend suggested that I watch this movie and all I can say is awesome and amazing. <br />
<br />
Story: 10<br />
Storyline pretty easy to understand. Bad guy declares destruction to the world. Good guy Luffy somehow gets involved especially when a nakama is involved. Luffy beats the bad guy up along with his crew while doing it really cool and awesome. <br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
The animations are done really well for each character as well as the scenery for the whole movie.<br />
<br />
Sound:

          <span style="display: none;" id="review79914">
        9 <br />
The sound effects are really good, feels like you are kind of there in my opinion as well as the explosions which I mean come on, One Piece gotta have explosions.<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
All I can say is gotta love the Straw hat crew. Luffy leading the crew, pure awesome. Bad guy also developed well.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
Loved it, fighting is great as always and you are always wanting more, fighting for your nakama is why One Piece is awesome.<br />
<br />
Overall I gave this movie a 10 as it has it all for a good all round One Piece Movie that is sure to deliver action, comedy, nakama power just like in the anime.

    I absolutely loved whatching this movie! Luffy and the crew are separated have hit mulitiable flying islands filled with Beasts far overgrown. As they all try to meet up, they seem to have a lot of fun, or atleast Luffy does xD i wont spoil anything for you but you will enjoy watching This if you love the anime One piece. You should definitely watch this as the Art, Storyline, and sounds are all beautiful plus I can only add to the One piece storyline :)

    Light Spoilers In This Review:<br />
<br />
Welcome to Jurassic Park! A land filled with incredible creatures and danger at every turn! Hold on....wrong movie. One Piece: Strong World takes place sometime between Thriller Bark and the Sabaody Archipelago arcs and focuses on the legendary pirate Golden Lion Shiki. For the last 20 years after escaping Impel Down Shiki has been experimenting with &quot;IQ&quot; plants in order to create extraordinarily powerful animals in which he intends to destroy islands with. <br />
<br />
Story/Character: One Piece is certainly well known(in the anime especially) for dragging things out, but this movie just drew the line with me for how much of my

          <span style="display: none;" id="review206475">
        time they could waste. I am a huge fan of One Piece and I typically let these types of things slide, but for more than half the movie I felt like I was watching endless exposition. The new antagonist Golden Lion Shiki who is built up in the anime to be this intimidating character taking on the likes of Roger doesn&#039;t bring much to the table either. Shortly after watching almost everyone in the crew fight a mutant group of animals we learn that none other than Nami is kidnapped. Later on in the movie she feels forced to join Shiki&#039;s crew in order to save her friends and family. This not the first time we have seen Nami in this situation and I felt this was very weak from Oda&#039;s usually great story telling.The only saving grace in this movie was Luffy&#039;s finishing blow to Shiki but lets be honest here...what is a One Piece movie/arc without that iconic knock out?<br />
<br />
Art/Sound: Not much needs to be said here for a One Piece movie. The same soundtrack we have come to love and know is present throughout the movie, and besides some scenes of Shiki&#039;s floating fortress of a ship we don&#039;t see anything too daunting in the art department either.<br />
<br />
Overall: If you are a big fan of One Piece like I am I do recommend watching this movie. However, watching Strong World long after it&#039;s release and having already seen Film Z (which is far superior) it&#039;s hard to say whether I will ever be watching it again. At best there are a couple of good fight scenes and little quirks such as new outfits that make this movie worth it if you have the time.

    i was really really really really really ..... disappointing about this movie :( when the the &quot;ep 0&quot; was the first episode that i watched from this anime ..and it was the main reason that i am still watching it .. its obvious that i will hate this movie a lot !!!!! it was really horrible , why ? i am telling you why !! when they said in ep 0 that he was the one who fought against Gol D. Roger .. and the first who esscaped alife from Impel Down.. and was the one who destroyed half of the marine ford by himself

          <span style="display: none;" id="review238574">
        !! and the white beard himself Admitted his power... and he waited for 20 years to start his plan !!! and that all fall down just because of luffy !!!! and he has beaten him by only using gear three !!! you gotta be kidding me !!! and the plan that he was working on to make a strong creatures was only a joke !! in the other hand, even luffy who has beaten him could hardly beat one monkey -or sthing i forget what it was for specific-in the place that he was training in using gear 4 !!! Oh its just a miss ~!?&gt;

    One Piece Movie 10: Strong World Review<br />
<br />
<br />
Story (8/10) Very Good<br />
More Specifically (8.50/10) Very Good+<br />
<br />
The 10th One Piece Strong World Movie was finally the One Piece Movie I was waiting to see which is something within these One Piece movies worth calling a movie quality presentation. The Story for Strong World is very simple with a lot of adaptations and setups before the movie even coming out a prequel OVA, a manga adaptation by Oda and even some filler setup episodes within the One Piece anime during the Impel Down Arc. I think for a movie this accomplish what it set out to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art and Animation

          <span style="display: none;" id="review209702">
        (9/10) Great<br />
<br />
Finally some eye candy in One Piece by Toei. One Piece Strong World I was told is one of the best things One Piece animated and I have to agree it does look really really nice. It barely reach movie quality yes but that&#039;s not taking anything away from it because this is Toei we are talking about. The animation and art style for this movie is great and I heard the only other film that look this good if not better is Film Z, I&#039;ll be the judge of that but for right now Strong World is the best thing One Piece animated in my opinion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound (10/10) Masterpiece<br />
<br />
Glad the movie got an English dub so I can focus on the nice visuals this movie brought to us. The jungle music played through out this movie and even during the outro fit this movie perfectly and all the theme music of the characters when they are doing their thing (Zoro theme and Sanji&#039;s theme to be exact) we&#039;re welcomed and only made their shining moments that much cooler to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters (10/10) Great <br />
<br />
The Straw Hats were depicted perfectly in this movie and rightfully so since Oda created the script for this one. Everyone got their shine here, Shiki and his two main minions were entertaining every time they took the screen the clown and hit farting shoes made laugh everytime he walked and the pervery gorilla was quite funny as well. Shiki himself is a hyped up and strong villian and he proves that in their first battle against them not many villains could wipe the floor of majority of the Straw Hat crew with that much of an ease (whether they were fully ready or not). Other new characters like Billy the Duck were entertaining as well being a duck the discharges electricity reminded me of Pikachu and it fit well with the Rubberman Luffy that duck is such a good character I wanted him to be apart of the crew permanently. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (8/10) Very Good<br />
More Specifically (8.75/10) Very Good+<br />
<br />
My enjoyment for this movie was very good. It did help that it was in dub but even if it wasn&#039;t my view on the movie wouldn&#039;t have change that&#039;s just a plus. The entire movie was entertaining from beginning to enter and that&#039;s saying a lot because no One Piece movie so far has accomplished that. <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall (9/10) Great<br />
More Specifically (9.25/10) Great<br />
<br />
Strong World lived up to the hype that was given to it. I can definitely slap my seal of approval on this one if anything. I knew Toei could adapt something great if they felt like it and this is proof. <br />

    I saw this movie a long time ago. And I have to say that it is highly overrated.<br />
This movie is like a &quot;remake&quot; of the Arc of nami with arlong . Because the story its the same with an old enemy of  Roger the King Pirate. its the same &quot;Nami comes back&quot; bla bla, &quot;you  are my nakama&quot;, &quot;i Kick the ass of an old legend&quot;.<br />
the  art and sound is not anything special. <br />
is enjoyable but normal.<br />
character development is bad with a villain who gives more laughter than fear<br />
