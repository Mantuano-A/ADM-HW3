    :: This review was written after watching all 12 episodes and may contain some spoilers ::<br />
<br />
Before I can begin my review, I think we should cement the fact that normally season 2 of harem shows go down the gutter, no matter how good the first season is. That is what I felt during the beginning of the season. Each episode felt like a chore to watch, but as the story progressed, something magical happened. I actually started having fun watching it. I started looking forward to what it had in store every week. I think that is where The Quintessential Quintuplet&#039;s profound strength lies, although

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386613">
        being generic, it adds special ingredients to spice up the show allowing it to shine brighter than others in its legion.<br />
<br />
:: Story ~ 8 out of 10 ::<br />
This season gives each girl enough time to shine, unlike the first season, which primarily focused on ahem ahem… Miku. Personally, I was constantly in turmoil which girl to cheer on, each time I got anchored on one, next episode changed my perspective. The waifu wars was real with this one haha. BUT, if I were to choose one, I would go for Nino. I feel like she was the highlight of this season. I mean, her confession scene was so adorable! The whole season as a whole is very well done, I really have no complains whatsoever! <br />
<br />
:: Art &amp; Sound ~ 10 out of 10 ::<br />
I saw a lot of people complaining how the art style has seen significant degradation from the first season. I think that&#039;s balderdash. The art feels much more clean and refined, which looked kind of gritty and grainy in the first season. And those sick transitions in the opening wins my heart every time. The music also saw a significant step-up! The OSTs are so so adorable, and I have been jamming to the opening ever since it came out on Spotify! All in all, I can confidently give this section of the anime a perfect score.<br />
<br />
:: Characters ~ 9 out of 10 ::<br />
I mean, you can&#039;t hate any of the characters in this show can you? Well... maybe except Ichika. I although felt bad for her—she lost the waifu wars even before she could try—but I didn&#039;t like her ways of trying to win Fuutaro through subterfuge. Even then, I cannot &quot;hate&quot; hate her, cause in the end of the day, nobody wants to let go of the person they love (except maybe Yotsuba). Coming back to the topic at hand, all the characters are chic and sweet with Nino being the best girl though!<br />
<br />
:: Enjoyment &amp; Overall ~ 9 out of 10 ::<br />
If not evident already, I thoroughly enjoyed this show. It is in the top three of the season for me, the conglomeration of charming characters, excellent art and music and good enough story telling, provided me a lot of joy throughout its airing cycle. If this has been in your PTW, I think you should certainly start with it!

    AH YES, another season of the Quintessential Quintuplets, only that because Fuutarou is in the equation and being the tutor that he is, so they had to make the sequel name more mathematical: in the form of a ∬ or double integral as it&#039;s called: representing the volume under the surface. And that&#039;s quite the heavy volume of 5 sisters under Fuutarou&#039;s surface (of a nose). It&#039;s double the integral calculus, double the trouble.<br />
<br />
Harem rom-com shows are such a staple at this point, and mangaka Negi Haruba&#039;s work is no different: the 5 Nakano sisters of Ichika, Nino, Miku, Yotsuba and Itsuki all vying for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386626">
        the spot of being noticed by the airhead that is the high-scoring Fuutarou. Only that now because of the arrangement between Fuutarou and the father of the  Nakano family, things begin to shed more openly as the 5 sisters (well 4, minus Yotsuba) all start to be more daring towards Fuutarou, and trying to get him notice the BTS work from the hidden annotations of the sisters to the confessions themselves (that Season 1 has prepared us for the moments of this sequel).<br />
<br />
In a nutshell: this is the only time where you can cheer for your chosen #Team&lt;which Nakano girl&gt; you&#039;d like to see win the spot as Fuutarou&#039;s eventual bride. They&#039;re all &quot;BUT SHE&#039;S STUPID.&quot; levels of loveable and endearing, though their love tactics are pretty much different in the midst of all 5 sisters playing the lookalike game (since they look so similar) to confuse our main boy to no end. But he&#039;s smart, he can definitely figure his way through.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s no gander that if Season 1 is to your taste, then Season 2 here most definitely will up the ante by a few things:<br />
- Same story, characters and setting, only that Love is War, and love is (and isn&#039;t) fair game to all, except when one tries to derail plans for a train-wreck that shows the nastiness of jealousy.<br />
- The visuals unassumingly got a mixed feeling of both ups and downs: Instead of the soft and light-hearted Tezuka Productions, Bibury Animation Studios are chosen to helm this sequel for some trade-offs: those thicc thighs are gone now, but the visuals earned an upgrade due to Bibury&#039;s use of much heavier colour palettes that I can&#039;t say that I needed it, but it definitely was felt throughout the show.<br />
- A different OST by the 5 seiyuus who voiced the Nakano girls, though I prefer the match-up of Season 1&#039;s OP and this season&#039;s ED for the best of both worlds. Regardless, some of the same good sound design.<br />
<br />
Pretty much more of the same, I can&#039;t complain when I&#039;m enjoying a good rom-com.<br />
<br />
What&#039;s more, ready for Season 3 (and quite possibly the final season)? We may see the manga to its end!<br />

    5-toubun no Hanayome is a pretty good harem/romance anime where all five of the girls fall in love with their tutor. The anime has that comedy feel aswell.<br />
<br />
I read manga after watching the first season of the anime cuz i wanted to now which of the girls was the winner at the end.<br />
<br />
Anime is basicly watching and cheering for your favorite girl to win the heart of main character. Hint girl i cheer for lost ofc but i was still happy cuz its fun to watch.<br />
<br />
Second season is even be better then the first one becouse girls actualy started confessing and its SO CUTE you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376117">
        can tell every girl has different aproach to confession and love they all try so hard.<br />

    5-toubun no Hanayome ∬ is basically a anime about self-entitled little girls who need a reality check and to stop acting so self-obsessed or excuse my language like hoes. Everything the main girls - Yotsuba Nakano, Miku Nakano, Nino Nakano, and all the others do is embarrassing but also rude to all the other characters around them. Unwatchable. You spend your time feeling guilty for everyone as they have to deal with these people who are so full of arrogance. I tried to continue through and hope the story would develop their character. After 4 episodes I decided I couldn&#039;t deal with these girls anymore,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review378328">
        which is disappointing as the synopsis seemed so promising and the other girls showed so much promise as cute and engaging characters, but the show focuses on the worst written ones including of course the main protagonist. Very unoriginal boring plot takes place and without a good plot it becomes a dry flow of pictures with highly pitched female voices on your screen.

    (TLDR at the bottom, and as always, thanks for reading)<br />
<br />
I was originaly going too rite liek this and give QQ (not china app) a 3/10 becuase it reminding me to much of Nisekoi (very bad cartoon) and STFU NINO, BRUH.<br />
<br />
But then I actually gained the brain cells to notice that it was time for me to be a mature reviewer of myanimelist.net and thus, constrained myself from writing such vile, such lazy parody of a review.<br />
<br />
In seriousness, I just found a liking to The Quintessential Quintuplets 2 which is surprising because ridiculous stories like themselves tend to get the worse side of me. I guess

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386624">
        being a lenient person has its benefits. More truthfully, the story execution just gave me a reason to stay. I don&#039;t usually tend to enjoy a lot of harem anime because they feel like a distorted version of romance bent and shaped so much to the will of the story that no character or plot holds any real value anymore, it just becomes a superficial but hollow inside. I am glad to say that this wasn&#039;t the case with The Quintessential Quintuplets, or at least, it wasn&#039;t exactly as I described some harem anime.<br />
<br />
Before I start, important questions must be answered immediately. Which will serve as some meaning later on in this review.<br />
<br />
Which team am I on?<br />
Team Miku. I am a simple man. I love the sweetheart. This is coming from someone who has dead emotions too. She is one of a kind cinnamon bun. The amount of times she makes me squeeze my pillow is amazing. But enough about me.<br />
<br />
Which character do I hate?<br />
Nino. Think of it like this. Taiga, but has pink hair and is taller.<br />
<br />
<br />
Narrative:<br />
Very simple narrative, I would like to assume people reading this are already completed with the 1st season. In which case this season starts off from that point. I will tell the honest truth now. I don&#039;t remember a bloody thing from the previous season, I watched it quite a while back anyways. Though, the continuation from the previous season felt really smooth getting into the details of what is the be of this 2nd season. No unnecessary time was taken for the sake of it. So I give props to that. It also manages to converge the two parts of the 1st and 2nd season without any hint of awkwardness, excluding nerfed animation.<br />
<br />
What really gives the story its good quality is how it differentiates from other harem anime similar to it, and that is the race to Fuutarou.<br />
<br />
Like every harem anime similar, there has to be some kind of battle to who can get out with the MC the fastest, some are more explicit with making the race more obvious. But Quintessential Quintuples takes the cake for me. Admittedly, I am not widely into the genre, but I would like to believe that this is one of the few stories that actually knows how to make a good race to the MC. These sisters are willing to use their appearances to their advantage by manipulating Fuutarou into thinking things that don&#039;t correlate to the person behind the facade. They are also willing to physically go as far as changing themselves in terms of school grades, family relationships, and other miscellaneous. It is interesting to watch really, I wouldn&#039;t have guessed that such writing skills actually existed for harem anime. To be fair, you could argue that this is quite superficial in that the use of sisters, especially for this story is one that allows for shortcuts. And well, I suppose you could say that. I don&#039;t have many counters for that. However, the idea has been taken and has been used in a substantial way even though there are some arguably cheap shortcuts used. Problem with that? I wouldn&#039;t say I find that too bad, but it can easily get static for the sake of moving the plot forward. That doesn&#039;t happen too much with this one though, I will give it that. Not the best, but decent writing honestly.<br />
<br />
As for characters, we don&#039;t like Nino so we can skip her out of the review…<br />
<br />
I guess Nino does have some good points that need talking about. She actually has one of the best developments in the show, and I could argue the best. You would think tsunderes like her would stay static for the sake of binary diversity, but she changes for the better in some sense. Whilst maintaining her character she also manages to implement a sense of reality in herself, which leads her into actions you might have seen coming, but not as early as you thought it would. She has a surprisingly logical rationale when talking to others about some points too. I just wouldn&#039;t have guessed for her to be this much better honestly.<br />
<br />
Ichika is a sly lady, who likes to mess up with others&#039; attempts at getting closer to their goals. I quite like how she plays if I am honest, even if it is a dirty trick or two. I don&#039;t usually see characters like her a lot, but it is probably because this story has the interchangeable sister theme going on, which allows easy tricks like misinformation to happen. Good character overall.<br />
<br />
Miku is another interesting one, if I could put it into perspective, she would be like every &quot;girl chasing boy&quot; anime, but, in this story, there are her sisters to worry about alongside. It makes for an interesting path for her honestly. When she tries her best, whether it be for simple day to day activities to powering through studying, there is some kind of foil she has to beware of. How she goes around this is well, keep trying for her side. I can&#039;t dive too deep into her character.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t have much to comment on Yotsuba and Itsuki, they don&#039;t have as much importance as the other three in this season. Yotsuba feels a little like those characters who constantly lie to themselves in the name of keeping the stability of the sisters and Fuutarou higher rather than lower. Quite a classic trope but she prevails with it. Not a problem with how she is used in the anime really. Itsuki is the same old in my opinion, she is the least interesting in my eyes and doesn&#039;t really do anything to better her own character. Shame, but who cared about her really.<br />
<br />
I swear I don&#039;t like Fuutarou. He doesn&#039;t develop and is still the dense dude he was from previous seasons. How can this dude not tell who is who by now is beyond me. But hey, some misunderstanding just had to exist for the sake of it now. But his character is unbelievable and just ridiculous. I can&#039;t give him the benefit of the doubt or tell you that you will like his character.<br />
<br />
<br />
Audiovisuals:<br />
They are nerfed in comparison to the 1st season. I can&#039;t say it was appalling but it was generic for the most part, you can certainly find something better in this day and age. The animation was decent for the most part. I have nothing to complain about.<br />
<br />
Audio is the same really, generic OST, OP and ED. Don&#039;t get me wrong though, they were good to listen to but it for sure doesn&#039;t match up anything of 10/10 in my opinion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Now. Why I answered the important questions above was simple. This is really enjoyable when you are on someone&#039;s side. I liked Miku, so I went with her. I had moments where I was like &quot;well, damn.&quot; and &quot;wooooo yeahhhh&quot; just because I would have wanted the best for the character I choose. I think that is an interesting way to go around enjoying the anime in an external sense. With the quality of the race being that much better, it is actually really fun to just watch what happens next to your favourite girl in the series. Harem anime needs to take notes on this on for real. Other enjoyment factors come down to general comedy moments, they aren&#039;t anything that will get you wheezing but they get the job done well enough to be fair. It is fun overall.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall - 6.4 (6)<br />
----------<br />
<br />
TLDR Review:<br />
Story - 6: Good writing for the race to Fuutarou, even if a lot of shortcuts were taken.<br />
Visuals - 6: Fine, standard, everyday animation.<br />
Audio - 6: Same as visuals.<br />
Characters - 7: They are all good characters, apart from Fuutarou<br />
Enjoyment - 7: Now that&#039;s a fun race.<br />
Overall - 6.4 (6)<br />
----------<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t really say I have anything to say other than this is a good surprise. I was legitimately going to give this a low ass score if it took the Nisekoi way around of telling the story. Glad to say it didn&#039;t. I would recommend you keep watching this but this isn&#039;t a high recommendation regardless. I mean. This is just fine rather than exceptional. Still good I suppose.

    Quintessential Quintuplets Quietly returns with a Quaint little sequel. Queerly enough, it didn&#039;t seem to garner too much attention, though that could possibly be due to the popularity and notoriety of several of the anime it&#039;s airing alongside sort of pushing it out of the spotlight. Or perhaps it&#039;s because a Quite common complaint people give about this show is that it&#039;s &quot;generic&quot;. And you know what? They&#039;re right. But Quizzically, that&#039;s not necessarily a bad thing. Despite having several themes and tropes in common with similar types of shows, along with having a pretty simplistic narrative that follows a typical romcom formula, Quintessential Quintuplets

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386640">
        can still be a Quality viewing experience.<br />
<br />
Questing for the ultimate harem may seem like an unattainable dream to most men, yet for Fuutarou, it&#039;s a reality. A beautiful reality. Yet what does he do about these girls who clearly like him? NOTHING. To him, studying &gt; about everything else &gt; romance. I don&#039;t know whether to respect this man for his dedication to academics or facepalm at his denseness. I guess it&#039;s a bit of both. The show primarily focuses on his continued tutoring of the girls and the development of the relationships between the six of them. It&#039;s a little more bare bones than season 1 because in that season, Fuutarou had to work to get the girls to trust, respect, and want to learn from him, which was interesting to watch. Now that that&#039;s been established, this season hones in more on the slice of life aspect of things. <br />
<br />
Quips and other sarcastic sayings are constantly used to provide humor. These moments are often enhanced through the characters making funny and sometimes chibi-esqe faces. Jokes are primarily about romance misunderstandings, the stupid nature of the girls, and the oblivious nature of Fuutarou. The comedy is definitely one of the driving forces of the show, so if you&#039;re not into the type of humor utilized, this anime probably isn&#039;t for you. Of course, there&#039;s still the more serious aspects of the show that you could enjoy.<br />
<br />
Quarreling with one another ends up being a common driver for conflict in this anime. This season gives a lot of attention to Nino in particular and her conflicting feelings, as well as the girls accepting that they&#039;re growing up and changing into their own individuals. It&#039;s by no means an amazing narrative and the themes are pretty obvious for a show whose heroines are Quintuplets. But the &quot;drama&quot;, if you can call it that, can keep things interesting. Though for me, what stands out about this anime and makes it truly worth watching would be the girls. So it&#039;s time to go over them!<br />
<br />
Quiver in fear before the might of NINO! When she&#039;s able to build up her confidence and character, her resolve is astounding. I can totally see her going around and saying embarrassing things to strangers like &quot;Hello, my name&#039;s NINOOOOO!&quot; I&#039;m gonna say it. She became best girl for me because of what she did this season. It&#039;s no secret that tsunderes are one of my favorite character tropes, and Nino fits the bill for this type. She was the most hostile towards Fu-kun and rejected his involvement in her and her sister&#039;s lives, even though deep down she&#039;s probably the most feeling and affectionate of the bunch. But through a sequence of events, she eventually realized that this greedy and deadbeat dude was in fact her prince charming. And I just love how she acts after that. From flat out confessing to him to making sure she won&#039;t lose to anyone for his feelings...it&#039;s just great. Once the dere side emerges from the tsun, Nino becomes quite the strong and caring individual, and I really enjoyed her character arc. <br />
<br />
Quoting historical warlords would probably be considered fun by our next girl Miku. She has the coolest character design and personality, and despite having a more emotionless nature, the girl lights up in the presence of Fuutarou. Like Nino, I&#039;m a big fan of her type, and her dedication to the man she loves is admirable. Miku is definitely the most supportive of him, and she has a ton of heartwarming moments. She also easily gives the best facial expressions in the show. Fun stuff. She also has the most lewd scenes since she&#039;s drawn seductively several times wearing lose and skimpy clothing. Sexy stuff. She&#039;s right there with Nino for me in the fight for being &quot;best girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Quenching this girl&#039;s hunger may be difficult. It&#039;s Itsuki! She&#039;s probably the calmest and most reliable of the girls, but also has some deep rooted fear and uncertainty. She&#039;s not really involved in the battle for Uesugi-kun&#039;s affections. Instead, she acts as a sort of voice of reason and moral support for him. I like their dynamic, and think it&#039;s a great aspect of the anime. <br />
<br />
Quake in anger at Ichika&#039;s underhanded methods at getting ahead! Yeah, I definitely feel like some will be rubbed the wrong way by her using her sisters to try and indirectly hook her up with Fuutarou-kun. But hey, as they say, all is fair in love and war. She likes to act like the big sister and provides for her siblings through work, but might be the most immature deep down. I&#039;m interested to see if she ever gains the ability to let her true feelings out. <br />
<br />
Quick in terms of speed, not in terms of smarts. That about sums up Yotsuba. She&#039;s definitely the girl who gets the least amount of focus as she&#039;s not shown to be vying for Uesugi-san&#039;s affections like 3 of her sisters or being a frequent presence in his life like Itsuki. Nonetheless, she has some fun moments. Hmm...maybe she&#039;s playing for the endgame and is actually brighter than we all thought...<br />
 <br />
Qualms you might have about this anime are understandable. Now I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything particularly bad with the anime asides from some inconsistent and mediocre art outside of the care and detail put into the girls&#039; designs (At least the studio has their priorities straight!). Also, the difficulty in trying to portray the girls as being identical yet giving them completely diverse designs and voices can make things feel off. I get it, it would be boring if the girls all had the same character design and voice actress and this way we get a nice variety of looks. But it still makes other characters, especially Fuutarou, look like complete idiots when they fail to properly differentiate between the siblings, especially when they&#039;re not even trying to impersonate each other. We just gotta be able to understand this fact and deal with it. And I can definitely understand people calling the show plain, since it doesn&#039;t particularly have any big moments...except for Nino&#039;s straight up confession because wow, you practically never see a girl do that in an anime. But overall, I feel like this anime can be a fun, relaxing, and enjoyable watch for most. <br />
<br />
Quantifying a score for this anime was actually a difficult task for me. It has a fair share of good things going for it, but it also just feels a bit lacking in several departments. Overall, I would have given this a 6/10, but because Nino and Miku exist, I decided to bump up my rating. Hey, what can I say, cute anime girls just have that kind of power! And ultimately, that&#039;s what will probably make or break this show for you. Whether or not you like the cute anime girls. This is clearly a character driven narrative, and for me personally, the girls are a colorful bunch who most certainly make Quintessential Quintuplets worth the watch.

    Itsuki&#039;s fat fucking bahoonkie donks? honkers? what? omg monkey brain go o o e e a a, jaw drops to floor, eyes pop out of sockets accompanied by trumpets, heart beats out of chest, awooga awooga sound effect, pulls chain on train whistle that has appeared next to head as steam blows out, slams fists on table, rattling any plates, bowls or silverware, whistles loudly, fireworks shoot from top of head, pants loudly as tongue hangs out of mouth, wipes comically large bead of sweat from forehead, clears throat, straightens tie, combs hair. Ahem, you look very lovely. omg stupid fuutaro cant tell them apart

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376252">
        smh my head why cant he just, look? is he blind? smh my head nino best girl he should see that as well, this is why america is going to shit, they fighing over best girl and its obvious who won, nino in my heart at least. fuck manga ending bruh. Quintessential Quintuplets has blessed this Earth with the single best girl in this possible girl on this planet, Ichika Nakano. Every time I see her i get hard, I cannot explain how much love I possess for this 2D drawing that isn&#039;t real, her cuteness and her best girl attitude has made me fall for her. You cannot comprehend the amount of time I have lost looking at a single frame of Ichika from this anime is not funny, but a reality. Ichika is the only thing that has been able to keep me going in this life, without her, my life would be meaningless, she has brought the holy light upon me and has blessed me with her own love for me and only me, there is nothing, and no one else that will be able to come close to her love that she has for me. She also has some massive honkies like goddamn I want to squeeze them and lick them

    Quintessential Quintuplets more like Quintessential Trash<br />
<br />
This anime is bland, boring and forgettable. On and on the mc is in a &quot;will they won&#039;t they&quot; plot, with 5 other cardboard cutouts as &quot;characters&quot; that can be summed up in my opinion as simple archetypes. <br />
<br />
The show doesn&#039;t even really know what character to spend time on resulting in a mess plot-wise. The mc&#039;s backstory is also quite generic and doesn&#039;t really inspire much interest to care for him. Quintessential Quintuplets offers nothing in terms of development with the cast, opting for using them just as obstacles for progression with the basic setup. This anime serves as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review392682">
        nothing more than a harem fantasy showcase. <br />
<br />
The art style and sound design are okay but nothing special that can make it stand out. Overall this show was terrible and I would not recommend wasting time watching it.<br />
<br />

    This is my first review so do bear with me.<br />
<br />
5-toubun no Hanayome ∬ (QQ), what a ride. It was somewhere around episode 5 of Season 2 that I decided I loved the show and binged the manga. I could not stop grinning ear to ear watching this show. It&#039;s marked a harem and while the quintuplets themselves may arguably fall into generic anime tropes, it doesn&#039;t detract from the overall enjoyment. <br />
<br />
Why you might ask? <br />
<br />
Perhaps, it&#039;s because each quintuplet genuinely cares about the other. Though they want to succeed, they don&#039;t want each other getting hurt to process. That in itself is a contradiction,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386942">
        and the show explores how and if the quintuplets can overcome this. Moreover, they have that little something that makes them unique and distinct from one another despite being quintuplets. That&#039;s the hook.<br />
<br />
Another reviewer, compared this to Nisekoi but I feel saying that&#039;s a stretch is an understatement. Nisekoi is a great show (I&#039;ve recommended it with S1 of QQ) with an interesting story, but the characters are very cookie-cutter and generic in nature and could have been in any show. QQ isn&#039;t like that. Each one is tailor-made, naturally, for this show alone. <br />
<br />
Admittedly, I enjoyed this season more than the first (though the first was very good in and of itself) because this time around, I feel the characters are better expressed and are given more time to shine. Though the tutelage aspect of the show is one of its quirks that I adore, in the later episodes this is toned down and the story focuses more on Futaro learning the things outside the books, like what it&#039;s like to be in love and loved back. It&#039;s just so nice. <br />
<br />
In terms of adaptation quality, it&#039;s very faithful to the manga in my opinion and not much has been left out. <br />
<br />
The opening song, Gotōbun no Katachi, is a pleasure to listen to - slightly more than the first - and is played on repeat in my house. The sister&#039;s being the vocalists for the song is just icing on the cake.<br />
<br />
This season had many great shows, but topping all those shows off in my humble opinion was Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu 2nd Season Part 2 (9.5) and this (9.5). It goes without saying I&#039;m excited for Season 3!<br />
<br />
It&#039;s only 24 episodes long (including the first season) so if you have time, give it a watch :)<br />

    Overall score: 7/10<br />
<br />
Now that season 2 is over, there&#039;s nothing more to be discussed about this season. This review is going to have some minor spoilers of the content displayed in these 12 chapters and some things that aren&#039;t (Just in manga between the animated chapters).<br />
<br />
First of all i would like to talk about the Storyline:<br />
<br />
In this season the Storyline got distorted from it&#039;s source material, things that are supposed to happen as soon as this season started didn&#039;t happen (Some of this content was displayed in later chapters) but this caused some scenes like Yotsuba&#039;s date with Fuutarou to be skipped in a very

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386749">
        disgusting way, there was also some material that was excluded for absolutelly no reason and there&#039;s no chance it&#039;s going to happen in season 3 either. Aside from that, the studio tried to show the most &quot;Important&quot; parts of the story... Wait, they didn&#039;t... Well whatever, you can see a lot of Miku and Nino scenes, that seems to be enough for Bibury Studios.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Art is kinda... Ugly? that may be the exact word to describe this. Animation, Character Designs, Backgrounds, they all seemed a lot cheaper than S1, but there are some scenes that look &quot;good&quot;, for example all the Miku related scenes, and hmm, that&#039;s it, there&#039;s nothing else.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
About the Audio all i have to say is that it was on point, actually good, nice voice acting and music, the only problem was chapter 10, i don&#039;t know why the audio and the chapter in general was in like speed x2.0 or something, they just rushed that chapter, not even a little pause between voicelines, that chapter had no impact at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters... This is where Gotoubun no Hanayome shines, these famous quintuplets, there were 3 things in this season about characters, the insane character development that Nino had, that Ichika just wants to steal Fuutarou from her sisters (As far as the anime showed us), and the fact that Miku is a crying baby who just make excuses to not do something.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
About the Enjoyment:  &quot;If you like Miku or Nino, congratulations, this is what you need, but if you like any of the other 3 sisters, it&#039;s gonna be a better experience to read the manga.&quot;<br />
<br />
// As you may see from my pfp i like Yotsuba, that&#039;s why i say this: There was just one thing i wanted to see in this season, Yotsuba&#039;s date, but it was supposed to happen as soon as season 1 ended, and all those things mentioned during the date in the anime were showed in the manga, they watching the movie, in the bath, even eating in Itsuki&#039;s favorite restaurant, they also skipped one part that wasn&#039;t even mentioned (I think this happened because the studio mixed the timeline) Yotsuba and Fuutarou were supposed to hide from Miku and Ichika when they were shopping and something was supposed to happen there... \\<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As i said at the beginning of this review, the overall score (for me) is going to be a 7/10 (If you like Nino or Miku i think this score may be higher). This could&#039;ve been better if they did exactly what the manga showed, but somehow they thought that changing it from it&#039;s source material they were going to make it better (It didn&#039;t got better, actually it got worst).

Short review after watching the first arc of this anime show<br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
A new season, an old harem plot. Nothing about the story impresses me too much. This season focus between Uesugi and the girl he met a few years ago, a girl that may have a connection to the five sisters. <br />
<br />
Art: 5/10<br />
The new art style change made me disappointed so much. For some reason, the art doesn&#039;t as smooth as the 1st season. It a huge shame when tits and thighs are gone this season. It isn&#039;t that bad but I don&#039;t like how the new art turn out<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
Nothing much to talk

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377193">
        about, OP and ED are quite decent.<br />
<br />
Character: 4/10<br />
the MC this season is clueless, Uesugi doing completely nonsense. Really poor character development( or maybe it only 4 eps). Our harem squad is boring too, Miku being nothing for completely 4 eps. The best scene when we see the character showing their emotion is when Itsuki and Nino argue and slap each other. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5/10<br />
The anime is under my expectation at the moment, but I know I shouldn&#039;t rush or anything. So let wait for more eps to take place. By the way, sacrifice thighs for the new art style make me minus 1.<br />
<br />
Overall score: 5/10<br />
This is the score I give for this first arc(4eps), not the whole anime. <br />
<br />

    Updated to the completion of the series! TL;DR at the end, and I’ll be rating this in comparison to the first season, as well as how I view it as a standalone in general<br />
<br />
Story 8/10: I would give this show a 7/10 because it follows the general harem formula, but I raised it up a point because damn did it get more interesting than the first season. It feels like events mean something more than just boosting a girl’s harem points, and that’s what makes the story better than, say, Nisekoi (another “missing life-changing childhood friend” harem). I like that there is a strong sense

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376965">
        of progress in all the characters as they change and progress.<br />
<br />
 It’s evident that each girl has their own very unique ways of showing Uesugi their love, and that makes for amazing conflict. Some try to hide it, some say it loud and proud. Even so, they are all dedicated to him and unwilling to back down without a fight. At the same time, while the quints have their ups and downs in their relationships with each other, they don’t let this one boy tear their family apart for too long, and there’s a theme of them being their own person while also being a quint, which I find empowering as someone who struggles with my own individuality and always thinks I can only be a team-player or a lone wolf.<br />
<br />
So, for a harem, the story is quite good!<br />
<br />
Art 10/10: I wouldn’t put it at Violet Evergarden’s level of beauty, but the jey here is that the style works for the show. It’s simple, it’s colourful, it’s animated, and most of all, it’s accurate to the manga. It’s a huge step-up from the first season. I don’t care for all the degenerates complaining about the nerfed thighs because they weren’t thick in the first place. Keep it in your pants, guys, and at least try to appreciate the artstyle change. Everything feels smoother and more in-vibe, and it’s 1000x more consistent animation-wise, too. The visuals in general are super nice, emotional, nostalgic, thrilling, tense and vibrant scenes all hit as they should. <br />
<br />
Sound 9/10: Any anime that makes its own opening song using the VAs of the main characters I can appreciate. It helps that the songs are catchy and suit the theme of the show. I also appreciate the BGM of which, unlike most shows, I actually was interested by enough to pay attention  to it (usually background tracks are dull, so I tune them out)<br />
<br />
The soundtrack enhanced the story a lot. That’s why i think it’s good.<br />
<br />
Character 9/10: Okay, let’s face it. The characters are archetypes assigned to a person. Yotsuba is the genki girl, Ichika is the onee-san, Nino is the tsundere, Miku is the kuudere, and Itsuko is the slightly tsundere main girl bait. Then there’s Uesugi, who is slightly breaking out from the stereotypical harem protag, but only because he’s mean and smart, unlike most.<br />
<br />
“Why, then, did you rate the characters so high?”<br />
<br />
Well, my friend. It’s because all the archtypes were done *well* enough that the characters intrigue me. Insight to the characters was what made the first season flop in this department. Miku and Ichika were literally the only decent characters in S1, and that stretches it. Season 2 gave us priceless development.<br />
<br />
Ichika got her development in S1, going from one-dimensional onee-san to a hardworking girl with a dream and low confidence that she’ll make it through school. She got further development in S2.<br />
<br />
Nino got a lot of development, going from a total brat tsundere, to a girl unable to let go of the past and fears that she’s been abandoned. Gets amazing development in S2 as well!<br />
<br />
Miku went from one-sided kuudere to a more expressive version of herself. She’s learned to care about herself and others, even despite her low self-esteem. She also stand up for what she thinks is right now. Also gets priceless development as she learns to love herself.<br />
<br />
Yotsuba has yet to have a lot of development, but it’s clear she’s not always happy, but tries to hide her feelings behind a genki facade. I can’t wait to see how she plays out. (After watching, wow. Yotsuba best girl! Went from team miku to yotsuba and no regrets [still love them all though])<br />
<br />
Itsuki, we find out, is always trying to keep her sisters together, and feels that she need to dedicate herself to filling the void left behind by their mother. She wants to change and be the best version of herself.<br />
<br />
And the Futaro himself has changed a lot. He cares about them, and wants the best for them.<br />
<br />
Are they the best characters every written? Not at all, but comparing these characters to other harem characters of their kind (rent-a-gf *cough*) as well as their season 1 selves I can’t see a reason to penalize this show. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 8/10: I ended up getting emotional at some parts because I was so glad for the characters. I’m not easily moved to tears but there was this feeling of relief and happiness when some of the plot points that were building up were settled. So many scenes have left an impression on me and it was a memorable season full of intrigue and mystery. Big revelations, big drama, big reconciliations that built to a wonderful climax where they just let it all out. I enjoyed it immensely and will be reading the manga because I just! Can’t! Wait! (No manga spoilers, but stick with this show man. Even if your team doesn’t win it’s worth it for story alone)<br />
<br />
TL;DR - Everything imoroved from the first season, and I am impressed. The real trophy is the character development that S1 lacked. The story has more drama, and I can relate to some of the events, and sympathize with each character because they feel real (Nino is often described as a bitch, but I argue that makes her character better than “only mean in a cute way tsundere waifu bait”) and their problems are real enough that I’m invested into the resolutions. Great season! can’t wait for the third

    I normally make a general statement that serves as an introduction in the reviews I make, as a means to situate the anime in its general context. But today I won&#039;t do that, because I&#039;m mad. And it&#039;s not the kind of mad a harem anime brings when your favorite girl doesn&#039;t win MC-kun&#039;s heart. It&#039;s the kind of mad where a series you&#039;ve been invested in, that had a very good running, starts to nosedive in a single episode. This is Gou-toubun no Hanayome, or the Quintessential Quintuplets and the downfall of what could have been an upper tier harem anime. Of course, I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386930">
        will not spoil this season, or else there&#039;s no point reading all of this. <br />
<br />
If you don&#039;t remember and need a little refresher about season 1, it was mostly dedicated to the set up of the relationship between Futarou, our main character and the quintuplets, covering their meeting and giving us a glimpse of each sister&#039;s personalities so you can pick your favorite horse and hope to win the race,and also was nice enough to give Miku a head start, which she desperately needed judging by season 2.<br />
<br />
The second season gave us something similar, getting deeper into the sisters&#039; relationship between themselves and with Futarou and giving us a glance into their psyche going into the competition, because it is, what I consider a competitive harem. More about that after I talk general structure more. <br />
<br />
Of course, this is harem, not romcom (nevermind, it&#039;s also romcom) and so the relationships progress a bit going into the story and our 4 sisters inch closer to the main character (What do you mean quintuplet means 5? Who the fuck is Itsuki?) and the race becomes all the more tense, as everything is fair game now. Everyone gets their moment with our MC and then episode 12 hits, I will talk about it later, because boy am I angered.<br />
<br />
The quintuplets? Well they don&#039;t stray from their characters much (at least not all of them do) so much as they evolve beyond a simple one line characterization in the face of love so feel free to keep hyping your favorite girl. Although, I will say one thing, this season opened my eyes to how great of a waifu Yotsuba is and it may be one of my favorite points within this season. <br />
<br />
So, as I&#039;ve now coined this term, what is a competitive harem? Well, call me wrong as much as you want but I personally see harem as the combination of 2 major types: casual and competitive harem.<br />
<br />
A casual harem takes the harem path throughout, meaning that there is no bad choice with your girl and she will end up with the main characters, all my favorite harem anime are casual harems, such as Highschool DxD, Trinity Seven or Monster Musume, and that&#039;s definitely not because they&#039;re all ecchi. The appeal of a casual harem is to not waste time on competition but rather build each individual romance, advance in a plot or even do both.<br />
<br />
As for competitive harems, which are larger in both anime and hentai (despite the let&#039;s all fuck together twist that we all know and love) and involve the main character choosing one girl and sticking with her, and the harem is a key story point. Despite having the quantity, I don&#039;t remember enjoying any of those, probably because of how controversial they end up being, as no matter who the author chooses, those who picked someone else will be mad at them and compromising will make the author look like a coward.<br />
<br />
A little mention about the artstyle because I really like how expressive the girls&#039; eyes looked, how whenever they feel a negative emotion, their eyes will have those black lines drawn through the pupils, I don&#039;t know it just felt very real and that was a very nice touch, great job to the one who came up with that because I think it&#039;s the first anime that did this.<br />
<br />
Now, if you want to see how much episode 12 was a train wreck for yourself, just know that I would have given this season a 1, if not for how much I respect non generic main characters and leave, it will get spoilery. <br />

MIKU THREW, ICHIKA THREW, ITSUKI IS DEAD IN THE RACE AND SOMEHOW NINO STILL BELIEVES SHE HAS COMPETITION. I CAME FOR A HAREM, NOT A SHITTY LOVE TRIANGLE. JUST ANNOUNCE THE WINNER ALREADY AND END IT! THERE WAS NO REASON TO GET THIS SEASON TO CONTINUE EVEN FOR ONE MORE SECOND. AND I HEAR THERE&#039;S A WHOLE NEW SEASON ANNOUNCED. WHAT EVEN IS THE POINT, JUST MAKE AN OVA AND CALL IT. STOP KILLING THIS DEAD ANIME EVEN FURTHER. <br />
<br />
I KNOW THIS ANIME CAN STILL BE SALVAGED BUT THE AUTHOR NEEDS TO STOP WRITING WITH HIS ASS AND PULL OUT AN ABSOLUTELY GODLY ENDING FOR THIS SHOW TO BE ANYTHING BEYOND FLAMING HOT GARBAGE THAT WOULD MAKE A&#039;Y ARSONIST DEPRESSED BECAUSE OF HOW HARD SOMEONE MANAGED TO TURN SOMETHING INTO A BURNING WRECK. FUCK QQ, FUCK HAREM, AND FUCK TEENAGE GIRLS. I&#039;M DONE WITH THIS ANIME, I NEED TO WATCH SOMETHING GOOD BEFORE I RIP MY EYES OUT WITH A PEN

    Harem anime have always been seen as those run-of-the-mill generic romance shows, chock-full of repetitive tropes you’ve already seen before. While some harem anime like High School DxD go all in with the direction they want and end up succeeding in their premise, the others are left to fade into the anime of obscurity that the genre harbors. When you think of a harem, chances are that things like Nisekoi, Date A Live, Mayo Chiki, or Familiar of Zero pop into your mind. Those shows are what I would say are representations of what a normal harem anime is like, but which show is perfectly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review389553">
        normal? Well, the answer is simple: The Quintessential Quintuplets. Here, I’ll be talking about this from a purely anime point of view, so however I feel about the manga will be irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Bibury Studios is taking on the responsibility of animating the quints this time around instead of the previous studio, Tezuka Productions. Before taking on this project, their only seasonal show had been Azur Lane, alongside a few Grisaia films. Considering their short history, it’s great to see how the show actually ended up turning out. All the characters in the show look bubbly and soft, including Fuutarou. The designs aren’t as detailed as they might have been in the first season, but I think the new style still fits in a different way. <br />
<br />
The characters themselves are voiced by extremely talented people. Kana Hanazawa as Ichika, who does a kind of soft and at times chilling voice; Ayana Taketatsu as Nino, who’s kind of high and mighty tsundere type voice works excellently for the character; Miku Itou as Miku, who aside from having the same name, nails Miku’s shy and reserved tone of voice; Ayane Sakura as Yotsuba, who does her job as the genki girl of the group very well; and Inori Minase as Itsuki, who’s character voice has the fitting feel of someone immature who desperately wants to be the mature one. Not to mention Yoshitsugu “Harem King” Matsuoka as Fuutarou, who has an impressively wide vocal range. <br />
<br />
Both the opening and ending songs for this season, Gotoubun no Katachi and Hatsukoi respectively, are sung by a group known as Nakanoke no Itsutsugo, who are made up of the voices of the quints. Having the actual voices of the characters sing for the OP and ED really adds to not only the quality of the song, but shows how talented they are at what they do.<br />
The premise of this show is as simple as it looks on the outside. It’s a show about a guy tutoring five quintuplets as he gets entangled between their love. Classic harem setup—one even reminiscent of something like We Never Learn. Though, as simple as the premise may be, something I’ve learned from s show like Jujutsu Kaisen is that no matter how basic a premise may be, the execution can quickly turn it from generic to great. <br />
<br />
The parts of Quintessential Quintuplets that separates it from others is how it handles its characters and plot in a way that builds naturally, but doesn’t spend its time with filler content that doesn’t really affect the rest of the story. Luckily for us, this second season spends no time wasted on simply building onto these characters. After all, we already know who they are from the last season. The time the show spends that isn’t related to the story arcs is used for expounding and growing the quints’ relationships with Uesugi, making each moment different than before. <br />
<br />
The stories that the show tells this season all revolve around the titular Nakanos. The first of five real arcs we’re presented with for the season is the Seven Goodbyes arc, which is also the longest arc in both this season and for the entire series, at the very least in terms of how much content it has. So much happens in this arc, and what happens has major effects on the rest of the season’s events, especially in terms of Nino’s character. We learn more about how the Nakano family used to be prior to Fuutarou becoming their tutor, and that includes the events surrounding the quintuplets’ mother. Though, this arc is all about coming to accept the changes in their lives and the truths that come with it, and that’s truly where the character development and growth come in.<br />
<br />
The second arc is the Second Year Last Exam arc, which is used to show us the aftermath and motivations each of the quintuplets have. To save themselves from being transferred to another school, they all have to get passing grades for their exams, but that’s far from their only motivation. Each one of them has their own personal goal that ties in to what they really want. We’re also shown the whole reason why the quintuplets are at that school in the first place, and part of the reason why Yotsuba cares so much more for others than she does herself.<br />
<br />
The third arc is where I think things really get into motion, setting up the three characters that affect the season the most: Ichika, Nino, and Miku. In the Scrambled Eggs arc, all five of the sisters are disguised as Itsuki, and Fuutarou has to maneuver his way through the web of feelings this brings upon them. He slowly but surely discovers a way to differentiate between them, which all culminates in a heartfelt ending, but one that closes off in mystery. A sentiment that’s been echoed throughout the season has been that love is the way to differentiate the quintuplets, and it’s here where Fuutarou finally understands the importance of that. It makes the viewer question themselves again: Who is the bride?<br />
<br />
The fourth arc is the New Class arc, and it’s a bit of a breather. I said it was a bit of a breather, but that doesn’t mean it’s free from any big moments. It’s here where Fuutarou slowly starts to realize that feelings like love aren’t things he can ridicule anymore, and opens up more to the people around him. He’s stated that he doesn’t tutor them for the money anymore, and only tutors them because he wants to. Though, it seems like he’s no longer just seeing the quints as his students, but also people who he can trust and care for, and will trust and care for him in return. He works hard to not only prove his worth as a student and tutor, but as a person as well. That said, this arc isn’t all about heartfelt realizations and such, as some character moments prove to be truly shocking. This is what I like to call the beginning of the larger Sister’s War arc, where each of the quintuplets is vying for a shot at Fuutarou’s love.<br />
<br />
The climax of this season’s version of the larger Sister’s War arc comes in the form of the Kyoto Trip arc, where we’re shown the lasting impact of their actions and the consequences that come with how they choose to achieve their goals. One small action creates such a large impact and divide between the sisters, and even causes Fuutarou to distrust one of them. Though, this all ends well, with everyone reconciling and regaining their confidence again. From here, the Sister’s War still rages on, but taking each other’s well-being into consideration.<br />
<br />
I’d like to talk about the characters that the show gives us, starting with Ichika. Ichika is the character this season I see as the most controversial. Ichika actually was my favorite from season one, prior to reading the manga, though, that changed as soon as a certain part came along. Honestly, I think lots of people also felt that way when they reached this part, since it really wasn’t a good move on her part. She represents the major theme of the show to an extreme extent, and that’s being selfish in terms of love. Her redemption arc by the end was very nice to see, showing us viewers her true nature, and her repentance for the mistakes she’s made. Though, the fact that lots of people were so impacted by her actions and how she ends up is a testament to how great the writing of the show really is, at the very least for this season. <br />
<br />
Alright, I’m saying it: Nino is best girl. So, that out of the way, I absolutely love Nino’s character. She’s genuinely the best tsundere character I’ve seen in anime. Nino exemplifies the main theme of the show in the best way possible, since she&#039;s very forward with her emotions, and will do what it takes to get to Fuutarou&#039;s heart, but she still cares deeply for her sisters. Her character growth from a pretty obnoxious tsundere character to a forward, considerate girl that knows what she wants and how she wants to get it. Her scenes in the Seven Goodbyes arc are her biggest moments of character growth, and she finalizes that growth by the end of the Scrambled Eggs arc, allowing her to be in her prime during the New Class and Kyoto Trip arcs. My personal favorite Nino scenes were the reveal of her new look, her bath discussion with Ichika, her working with Fuutarou at the restaurant, and her scene with Miku on the bed. Overall, Nino is a wonderful character, and honestly became one of my favorites in anime and manga throughout the course of the series. From design, to personality, to character growth, she’s done extremely well. <br />
<br />
Miku is the real fan favorite here. Her struggles with her shyness and anxiety in the series are ones that the audience can sympathize, and maybe even empathize with to some degree. Seeing her go forward with her desires in spite of her shy nature is one that the audience can all respect, even as fans of other characters. She keeps trying over and over again, but still gets stuck down, and it’s heart-crushing. Her resolve to get Fuutarou to notice her is great to see; she no longer wants to stand by and hesitate. She has many good character moments this season, but one that sticks out to me a lot is her significance in the Scrambled Eggs arc. That ending scene was packed to the brim with emotion, and I absolutely loved it. This season’s Miku is all about how she wants to grow and move forward with herself. This isn’t exclusive to Fuutarou either, since she herself said that she enjoys making things. Miku is a character that gets a lot of attention from people, including people close to me who’ve seen it, and she deserves every bit of it. She’s not my personal favorite of the bunch, but I can still proudly say that she is the most well-written one.<br />
<br />
Now, the other two quintuplets didn’t get as much screen time as the previous three, but I still think the moments they had were nice enough. Yotsuba in particular is an interesting one. There are two big reveals when it comes to Yotsuba, and one of them is a reason as to why she’s so considerate to others, especially her sisters. Yotsuba’s biggest scene, though, is changed a bit in the anime due to its placement in the timeline, but I think it doesn’t hurt the scene’s sentiment. Yes, the scene with Yotsuba and Fuutarou. That one is really sweet, especially how Yotsuba sees the city lights and discovers what she really did want from Fuutarou. This quintuplet right here is selfless to a fault. Her character is in contrast to someone like Ichika, since she has the weight of her past on her shoulders, making her want to help everyone instead of being a burden herself. Yotsuba is the character I would say is the most basic, but that means she’s a very down-to-earth and kind person as well.<br />
<br />
Itsuki is very important in one of the arcs, and that’s the Scrambled Eggs arc. She’s very important there, but also not really, because while everyone looks like Itsuki, Itsuki herself isn’t all that important for this section of the story. That said, the screen time she does get this time around is still somewhat interesting. Itsuki’s core character is about her and her relationship with her late mother. After her passing, Itsuki slowly became the mother figure of the group, or at least she wants to be that. After the events of the Seven Goodbyes arc, Itsuki discovers her ambition to be her own person. Itsuki takes more of a backseat this season, but she’s there when she’s needed.<br />
<br />
You can’t just talk about the main cast of this show without bringing up the protagonist. Fuutarou is truly a good protagonist, and a great one for harem standards. He’s full of personality, but it doesn’t bog down everything that is important to him. He’s written as more than just a character here, since the actions he takes in this part of the story is realistic to both what a normal person would do and what Fuutarou himself would do. His character for these arcs doesn’t ever stray too far away from what’s previously been established, but he never sticks too close to his baseline to the point that he’s generic and boring.<br />
<br />
Harem shows usually tend to go down the gutter in their second season, and that’s honestly what I expected from this show. It really isn’t anything revolutionary, but it still works amazingly well. This season is one I thoroughly enjoyed, from characters to story to music to art. I enjoyed seeing each of the characters’ growth, as even if I didn’t particularly like how a certain character did things, or if a character didn’t get as much screen time as I would have wanted,  all of the main cast’s antics were at the very least interesting. <br />
<br />
The themes this season were also acted on very well, especially with the three main spotlighted sisters this second season. The first season was all about setting up how Fuutarou has to share himself with all five of the quintuplets, but the second season is about how the quintuplets want Fuutarou all to themselves. This can be seen in even the OPs for each season, as the message is very clear when you actually take a look at the meaning of the lyrics. The status quo this season is much different than it was last time, and that’s evident as early as the first arc, which is all about changing and moving on. I also really enjoyed seeing the characters’ growth, them becoming their own them instead of being stuck to the past. <br />
Overall, The Quintessential Quintuplets Season 2 is truly a great series. It does so much of what it does right, and does it in only twelve episodes for that matter. It’s good on an objective level with how it does its technical elements, plot, and characters, but it also does well on a subjective, personal level, since it’s a show that I simply enjoyed watching. I often find myself listening to both Gotoubun no Katachi and Hatsukoi, the latter being one of my favorite anime ending songs.<br />
<br />
I’ve never really found myself a big fan of harem anime—they’ve never really been all that great, but not all of them are bad per se—but this anime just hit different, you know? I’ve never connected so much to a harem anime to the point that I find myself caring for the characters on more than just a simple waifu level or anything. If there were only one anime per genre left in this world, it would truly be a sad existence, but I certainly hope that the harem genre leaves behind this show. It truly is the show I would say is quintessential for its genre.

    Uh, this is my first time writing a review, and I decided to write one about this anime.<br />
Gotoubun no Hanayome ∬:<br />
Story: 8<br />
I have mixed feelings about the story? Is it bad? Or is it good? I can&#039;t make up my mind. But, it is entertaining for me. As long as the story is interesting, I will try to watch until the end. Bear in mind that I haven&#039;t read the manga yet.<br />
Art: 7<br />
First of all, I like how the colors are more vibrant and lively if compared to the previous season. But damn, I wish I could rate higher than this, but there&#039;s just something

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376265">
        that kept me from rating higher than 7. We all know how the female characters got nerfed (lol). Not stopping at this, the studio changing also made some characters&#039; proportion off. I&#039;m not expecting anything more from the art.<br />
Sound: 10<br />
Yes, the sound effect is on point. Characters&#039; voices matches their personality, at the least. Also, the intro&#039;s song is quite enjoyable.<br />
Character: 9<br />
Characters are on point. The personalities and how the characters act are almost on point.<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
I waited for the second season from the time I watched the first, and it was worth the wait. The composition of this anime is just like the previous season, and I will not drop this anime anytime sooner.<br />
Overall: 9<br />
The first four episodes is great, and you should watch it! For those who watched the first season, I recommend you to watch this too. For those who like harem genre, take a look a this. It might catch your eyes.

    Please note this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching 5-toubon no Hanayome SS and while care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned. <br />
<br />
Based on a popular manga of the same name 5-toubon no Hanayome SS which is better known to western audiences as The Quintessential Quintuplets season 2 is the second season of the Quintessential Quintuplets a Romance, comedy, school, and harem genre anime that premiered back in the winter of 2019 that served to introduce us to the poor but impressively intelligent Futaro Uesugi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386706">
        and how he comes to encounter, befriend and surprisingly become the tutor to the schools enigmatic Nakano sisters a group of Quintuplets that while unique in terms of temperament and appearance all share a common correlation in that all lacked skills that were crucial to them in their current life as high school students which was the all-important skill of being able to not only learn new subjects but also be able to demonstrate this by passing their exams a crisis that if not rectified would see them forced to vacate the school for another and start anew at another school. After much hardship and much sleep and time lost Futaro had managed to not only delay the deterioration of their school lives but also teach them the skills needed to not only face down their dreaded exams but also pass them with a comfortable enough margin of error and for the first times in their lives create a light of hope that they like their fellow classmates will be able to graduate high school and be able to join society as adults. <br />
<br />
Now in the aftermath of the school camp and the improvised fireworks viewing Futaro and the Nakano sisters find that as they approach their final exams that will either end with their ascendance to their third year or out of the school that they had for the first time grown to love and enjoy being part of that for the first time in their lives that they might be approaching a crossroads in their life one that might if given the right opportunity to blossom would serve to allow Futaro and the sisters to find the one thing they have been missing until now which is the attention of a special loved one that cares for them deeply. While I had been increasingly a fan of romantic comedies for a while since I had the opportunity to see many interesting ones since watching my first what arguably drew me to the Quints was not just the genre but also the unique premise that came from the combination of the school-based setting and the romance between Futaro a young man who apart from his skill at studying has almost no definable traits whatsoever and the Nakano sisters who despite being rich and popular and having many friends face increasingly dire straits as their exam scores plummet exam by exam. While the first season did an excellent job at introducing Futaro and the sisters and forging the bond that serves to both define and act as the foundation from which each would grow as individuals it also served to introduce the spark that will serve to ignite the passion of romance within their relationships when given the right opportunity aspects that served to draw me back to the series once season 2 was greenlit. <br />
<br />
The first episode I felt did an excellent job of not reintroducing us to the cast but also serve to highlight an important memory that served to not only allow us to see how much different Futaro was in the past as well as a link that was forged between him and his mysterious crush that served to tie his heart with the girl that he met all those years ago and giving the episode an air of intrigue which when working in combination with his interactions with the sisters served to keep me hooked until the end as it served to introduce the core question of whether one of the sisters was that girl from back then who had so effortlessly captured his heart. <br />
<br />
Futaro Uesugi <br />
<br />
Futaro Uesugi portrayed by veteran voice actor Yoshitsugu Matsuoka of SAO and Daimachi fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A sophomore high school student and later a senior over the course of the series Futaro from his initial appearances was shown to be a calm, intelligent if a quiet person by nature that while having an excellent memory and study skills that enabled him to attain the best possible grades within school was seen to have little to no social skills that would have defined a teenagers life in school at that stage in their lifespan. However, while having few if any friends within school as a result of his relentless drive to attain the highest grade possible in order to support his family by getting a decent job Futaro was shown to have little ill effect from it and indeed was seen to approach each new day and task that awaited him with fierce determination and a desire to complete each task as best as he can which showed well the sense of responsibility that he had that defined him as a person. However Futaro’s life of endless studying and trying to ensure that his beloved sister will have the best that he can provide her will soon change after a fortunate encounter with one of the Nakano siblings in the form of Itsuki who in turn will lead him to being offered the lucrative if rather stressful job of becoming a tutor for not just one but five girls who are in danger of failing their life as high school students. <br />
<br />
As a result of not only meeting the sisters but also bearing witness to the many physical and mental struggles that lay unknowingly within their life Futaro’s personality gradually starts to change. From the onset, while Futaro was shown to be largely a loner that had among his priorities his earnest desire to study and attain the highest possible grades to allow him to better support his family was impressive displays of focus and determination that if combined with a likable personality would have marked him out as an honor student within the class this intense desire to study served instead to create the opposite effect that instead marked him out as a loner that caused him to be shunned by his classmates and treated as an outcast among his classmates which served among other things to create within Futaro a curious lack of social experience with both his peers and with girls in particular. Though for the most part, these were of negligible concern to Futaro in his desire to attain the best grades possible this lack of social skill served to create a formidable obstacle when he becomes the personal tutor of not one but five girls in a gig that would have earned him enough money to support his family for a time if he were successful in his role. <br />
<br />
As the series progresses and as Futaro over the course of his role as tutor slowly bonds with the Nakano sisters this aspect of his gradually starts to change. While Futaro’s blunt nature remains consistent within his interactions with others were seen to change greatly with Futaro placing not just more trust in others but also showing for the first time a side that he had largely kept hidden from others which is one that was not only kind and caring but also one that had impressive levels of perception and an eye for detail when needed. While in the beginning Futaro only saw the role of tutor for the girls as a means to achieve his goals gradually as he not only befriended them but also saw the many unique problems that existed within them this sense of motivation gradually began to change and be replaced by both a determination to teach them to not only achieve their aims of passing their exams but also prove to their overbearing father that they are no longer children that need be constantly cared for traits that not only allowed him to break through the wall that stood between Futaro and society as a whole but also showed well just how much both he and the sisters had learned from each other as tutor and student. While serving well to introduce to Futaro not only the kind of power that can come from having genuine bonds with others and the need to maintain them in order to maintain the friendships that existed between them the many fun and often frustrating interactions that Futaro had with the sisters also served to show him the many things that he had been missing in life when he had been focusing his life entirely on studying a fact that while he does find somewhat hard to accept was something that he was thankful to the sisters for a fact that is shown well in his determination to show to others just how much the girls had grown both academically and as individuals as part of their gradual overcoming of the personal struggles that had restrained their lives.<br />
<br />
  While certainly an aspect of his pride this belief can also be seen as a means to help the sisters be recognized by their peers not simply as being the well-known Nakano Quintuplets but as individuals that have earned their place in class by virtue of their hard work as well a quality that I felt did well to further reinforce just how much meeting the sisters had changed Futaro as a person. Overall as a character Futaro as a result of not only meeting the Nakano sisters but also bonding with them and aiding them in overcoming the myriad of issues that had existed among their ranks had in my opinion really grew as a person as a result of not only forging tangible and increasingly strong bonds with them and those around him but also through this realized just how much more fun his life would be if he was to spend them not only learning together but also in interacting with others outside the confines of a classroom not as tutor and student but as friends a concept that prior to meeting them was as much alien as his life will be without studying. <br />
<br />
Itsuki <br />
<br />
Itsuki Nakano portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Inori Minase of Daimachi and School-Live fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the famed Nakano sisters being the fifth sister among its ranks. From her initial appearances Itsuki was shown to be an intelligent, diligent, kind, and caring person by nature that when combined with her calm, considerate and perceptive nature made her a very well-rounded person that would have earned her plenty of friends and active life within the high school had her grades not been slipping rapidly like her fellow sisters. While she like her fellow sisters was shown to be stubborn in her early days of meeting Futaro she unlike her sisters was shown to be willing to take the tough steps needed to help secure their future even if it meant having a fellow classmate tutor them even one as rude as Futaro was. At the beginning of the series Itsuki while certainly thankful and receptive to not only the idea of having a tutor but also having Futaro teach them both the knowledge and the methods needed to prepare for their exams was also shown to have a lack of central direction within her life which normally would have been the responsibility of her parents to nurture and guide. As a result, while certainly trying hard to avoid failing her exams Itsuki was also shown to have a lack of any kind of aspiration and careers that she wanted to aim for after graduation from high school.<br />
<br />
However, while serving to learn much about studying and the tips needed to use the learned knowledge to the best possible effect from Futaro Itsuki’s interactions with Futaro when combined with her unique knowledge of Futaro’s personal circumstance and motivation for studying as hard as he does as well as her own gratitude towards him for being the savior that she and her sisters needed the most served to create within Itsuki the kind of person that she until that point in her life had yet to encounter which was that of a role model that can introduce her to a path that can use what she treasures most within her heart and define a path for her future with this being the role of a tutor a role that not only Futaro is currently taking the place of but also one where her much-cherished mother was formally one as well something that Itsuki was forever grateful to Futaro for. <br />
<br />
However, it wasn’t just the career aspirations that meeting Futaro had served to create within Itsuki but also in the way that he interacts with her sisters as well. From the onset as the one that both approached Futaro first to act as their tutor and also the one that tried to sell the idea to her sisters Itsuki can be seen to be the one that introduced the concept of change within the family which while were receptive to the more open-minded nature of the sisters in the form of Ichika and Yotsuba and viewed cautiously by moderates like Miku were firmly opposed by traditionalists like Nino a situation that only worsened as time went on and culminated in her fight with Itsuki that caused both to leave home after Itsuki’s utmost attempt to defend Futaro from Nino’s scathing attack on him. While showing well not just Itsuki’s innate stubborn nature this development was also significant because it also arose from not only meeting and befriending Futaro but also from the fact that Itsuki like Nino was trying to preserve the family but unlike Nino, Itsuki was doing so in a way that enabled the sisters to develop and mature as individuals rather than simply let things remain as they are and in doing so showing Itsuki’s determination to act as the mother of the family and guide them in the best possible path just as she was in turn guided by Futaro. <br />
<br />
Miku <br />
<br />
Miku Nakano portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Miku Itou of Adachi to Shimamura fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the Nakano sisters being the third sister within their ranks. In her initial appearances, Miku was shown to be a quiet, calm, composed if a standoffish person by nature who while getting on well with her sisters was shown to prefer the company of books and games rather than her peers within her class. In line with her love for books, Miku was shown to be an avid reader with her specialty being Japanese history that she was shown to have great pride in. However, while an intelligent and a kind, and gentle person by nature Miku similar to Futaro was shown to lack the most standard of social skills which when combined with her easily embarrassed nature made her more willing to live her life as a recluse within class than face being possibly embarrassed in front of others. <br />
<br />
However, after meeting Futaro and becoming his student Miku gradually began to change.  While never completely abandoning her interest in reading and in Japanese history Miku thanks to her meeting with Futaro gradually becomes braver and while not overly forceful as her sister Nino was also started to show a far more assertive side to her willing to press on issues that either concern her or interest her. While never completely letting go of her quiet and reserved nature Miku as part of this change was also noted to have become much more talkative not only willing to express her own views and feelings but also more proactive in pursuing her affections for the person that she admires and loves in equal measure. Arguably the greatest change that came about from meeting and interacting with Futaro for Miku was the revelation that in order to both be better use to her sisters and to the person that she had fallen for she not only needs to have more self-confidence in herself but also a sense of determination to not only improve her academic skills but also gain the many skills that are needed in society not just as a student but as an adult that’s on the verge of entering society. Only after graduating from being a student will she be able to freely pursue the one that had so easily captured her heart and at the same time act as one of the pillars that hold the family together. <br />
<br />
Nino <br />
<br />
Nino Nakano portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Ayana Taketatsu of SAO and Citrus fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the Nakano sisters being the second sister of that group. From her initial appearances, Nino was seen to be a confident, determined, positive, and friendly if competitive person by nature that most would consider being very queen-like. Strong-willed, independent, and loyal of the five sisters Nino can be said to be both the glue that holds the sisters together and its mother being the one that’s also responsible for their cooking and medical needs. While serving well to allow her to take effective care of her sisters these traits while doing well in allowing her to deal with any threats to them also created within Nino a sense of wariness towards both strangers and to new ideas that they may bring along as shown in her reaction and subsequent responses to Futaro’s entry into their family as their new tutor when she used all available means to force him to leave them much to the dismay of her sisters that culminated in perhaps one of the worst fights that had resulted between the sisters. <br />
<br />
On the surface, while it&#039;s easy to see this behaviour as a physical manifestation of her competitive nature and a desire to solve everything by herself this can be said to be the opposite of what was occurring here for in Nino’s case, she viewed Futaro as a threat because he in her eyes was a disruptive force that was affecting the sense of unity that had long united the sisters a fact that is demonstrated well in the argument that broke out between her and Itsuki over Futaro. However, while these were indeed her base feelings at the time beneath them and at the heart of the turmoil that lay within her heart, Nino was also trying in her own way to change herself and striving to not only be able to stand on her own feet but be independent of her sisters in order to protect them better as the second eldest sister. At the same time while she grudgingly accepts that her actions towards Futaro in his first weeks were horrible her motivation for doing it was just in her eyes. <br />
<br />
Although the relationship between Nino and Futaro can be said to have started off on the worst possible way possible as Nino through her observations of Futaro gradually learned more about him and his motivations she slowly began to realize that Futaro while being offered a relatively large salary by her father for his role as a tutor was not simply teaching them because of that but rather he unlike the previous tutors was trying to genuinely help them not only by providing them with the best possible ways to study and use that knowledge to pass their exams but also in helping them resolve any personal issues that may be affecting them a fact that Nino had first-hand knowledge of having reluctantly accepted his help on a prior occasion events that soon served to make Nino realize just how much she had misjudged Futaro but also how much she needs to change herself so as not to make that same mistake again. This sense of wanting to repay Futaro for her treatment of him when used in combination with the gradual thawing of her ice queen like persona and her desire to forge stronger bonds with her sisters I felt was used excellently to not only showcase the many events that forced the change but also show the kind of determination that she possessed to not only change herself to better support her beloved sisters and build stronger bonds with them but also allow her to fully focus her herself on securing the heart of the boy that had caused her to develop such a change and in doing so sever the links of the past that had long kept her constrained and allow her to forge a better path towards the future. <br />
<br />
Ichika <br />
<br />
Ichika Nakano portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Kana Hanazawa of the Irregular at Magic High School and 3 Gatsu no Lion fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the Nakano sisters being the eldest among that group and at the start of the series being the only one that has an actual career in the form of a professional actress in her case. From her initial appearance, Ichika was shown to be a calm, graceful and composed person by nature that while kind and caring to all she meets also had an air of mischievousness and cunning about her that made it difficult to pin her exact feelings down traits that served her well as much as it did on screens as it did in school. As the eldest sister of the Nakano sisters Ichika from early on was forced to shoulder the burden of balancing not only her interest in acting and her career as an actress but in taking care of her sisters as their eldest as well. While it can be inferred that the sisters had no sense of financial worry on account of their fathers rank within the hospital in which he worked Ichika would still have needed to take care of issues that result from school and their day-to-day life an aspect that can be said to be a fine balancing act for Ichika that for a less capable person would have caused trouble for them. It is in the midst of this delicate balancing act that Ichika comes to encounter their new tutor and classmate in the form of Futaro. <br />
<br />
From the onset, Ichika’s relationship with Futaro can be said to be a unique one. As the first sister of the Nakano sisters, Ichika was someone that always strived to provide the absolute best for her sisters whether it was care for their well-being and day and day activities or leadership when things got serious. But while serving as an effective leader for the sisters for when it was most needed this large sense of responsibility was also seen to place much pressure on Ichika due to the fact that she had to balance both her role as the elder sister, her school life and her slowly budding career as an actress a balance that a lesser person would have stumbled if there had been even one mistake in timekeeping but not Ichika. However despite this impressive feat Ichika while doing well in hiding it from her sisters so as not to cause them undue worry was also shown to have tiredness to her that was exacerbated by the fact that she has no one that she can turn to for either advice or to vent to that is until she met Futaro. For Ichika Futaro proved to be someone that while enigmatic and one that proved difficult to affect with her usual charms at first gradually become someone that Ichika can choose to rely upon both as a person that she vent to while also being someone that she can drop her guard around with the latter being an early indication of her increasing bond with him as well. <br />
<br />
As a result of meeting Futaro, as well as a person that she can comfortably drop her guard around Ichika, can be seen to have been granted of reprieve of sorts that over the course of the season was used by her to great effect to both change herself but also change how she supports her sisters as well. While Ichika never completely loses her mischievous and calm nature over the course of the season she gradually becomes more mature both in dealing with situations that she encounters whether they are related to her professional career, social life, or romance related matters aspects that showed well her renewed sense of determination to not only help her sisters but also allow her to pursue the one person that had managed to break through her guard and find the real Ichika. However, while this sense of maturity served to allow her to significantly mature her growing feelings for Futaro also served to create the unfortunate effect of having to compete with her sisters that pushed Ichika to try and forge a path towards the future that will allow her to take without harming others a route that finds itself sorely tested in the face of Futaro’s honest kindness that draws herself increasingly to him despite her best attempts to resist. <br />
<br />
Yotsuba <br />
<br />
Yotsuba Nakano portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Ayane Sakura of Charlotte and Boarding School Juliet fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the Nakano sisters with Yotsuba being the youngest among their number. From her initial appearances, Yotsuba was shown to be a positive, cheerful, and talkative person by nature that while direct to a fault was someone that can be relied upon to always tell the truth when needed. Though when compared to her sisters Yotsuba can be seen to be a rather simple-minded girl that often gets her thoughts mixed up Yotsuba was able to compensate this by being diligent, responsible, and showing a level of determination and perception that one would often overlook when looking at her. Arguably what served to define Yotsuba as a person was her kind and caring nature and her desire to make as much friends as she can and help everyone as much as she can possibly can a task that while easy to say is a task that’s supremely difficult to action but yet is something that Yotsuba will endeavour to do day after day without fail. <br />
<br />
As the season progresses however and Yotsuba’s character is not only expanded upon and bonded with her developing bonds with her tutor and dear friend Futaro it can be seen that beneath her smiles and friendly nature that Yotsuba was also someone that had struggles of her own that she kept from her loved ones. While Yotsuba’s talent at sports when combined with her almost unlimited stamina was unmatched and served to make her a formidable talent for the sports clubs that were present within the school and served to allow her to help many of them via her joining them this was also offset by the fact that among her sisters she was the slowest at learning new knowledge which though can be compensated by her diligent nature also served to create within her a sense of low self-esteem and regret that she among her sisters was the slowest at learning and was the one that was slowing their overall progression down. While these were grave issues that served to affect Yotsuba’s heart greatly these were but minor issues when compared to the core issue that lay at the heart of Yotsuba’s heart which was the lack of the sense of self within her. While it is a given that as a member of society that you have an obligation to help others that require it Yotsuba was seen to be someone that took this to the next level not only running herself ragged trying to help as many people as she can but asking nothing for in return at all. While this itself is admirable in a sense when helping those that genuinely need it in this case this aspect can easily be taken advantage of by others a fact that was shown well when the track club tried to take advantage of her goodwill to make her a semi-permanent helper that thankfully was managed to be put to rest quickly by her sisters and Futaro before things could escalate further. <br />
<br />
In the aftermath of this turn of events Yotsuba was not only able to realize that while her boundless amounts of kindness and a desire to help people were not wrong, she also needed to be able to set conditions that defined the level of help that she can provide and not instead be relied upon to provide it as and when it is needed. Paired with this was the stronger bonds that she had managed to forge with both her sisters and with Futaro as a result of how much she had seen their concern for her as a result of her nature. While Yotsuba never loses her sense of kindness and desire to help others in the aftermath she was seen to have become much more assertive when responding and always ensuring that any decisions that she makes regarding them is followed through rather than letting things run their course as she did in the past and in the process also gaining a sense of confidence that she attributes to someone that’s dear to her heart. As a character Yotsuba though getting less romantic opportunities and focus than her sisters I felt was a well-rounded character whose development while just as drastic as her sisters were ones that were not so easily visible due to the fact that they largely lay within her heart an aspect that I felt resonated well with Yotsuba’s core personality traits of being someone that always followed her heart in every decision that she makes and ensuring that every moment that she shares with her sisters and Futaro as they laugh and have fun together is one that is strong, heartfelt and magical with her time at the park in ep10 being a notable favourite of mine. <br />

In terms of animation while the character designs for the girls have largely remained the same I felt that in this season there was far more detail and colour variation within both their existing designs as well as in the new environments in which the cast visit. This extra detail I felt was used well to complement the many romantic and sister bonding moments that were present within the series with the sister&#039;s revelation of not wanting to not have Futaro as their tutor, their save of him from the river, and their time at the hot springs being the most notable. Music-wise the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Gotoubun no Katachi and Hatsukoi which were performed by the veteran seiyuu singers Kana Hanazawa, Inori Minase, Miku Itou, Ayana Taketatsu, and Ayane Sakura who portray the Nakano sisters. Both of these songs while excellent in their own right I felt gave off contrasting feelings and emotions with the former doing well to not only reintroduce us to the quints and Futaro but renew the sense of trust and bonds that they have managed to forge with him over the course of the first season bonds that they hoped will continue for a long, long time while the latter song I felt was subtly different in tone and feelings and emotions generated in that it showcased not only the renewed bonds between the sisters that have only grown stronger since meeting Futaro but also the fact that they unlike how they were in the past had now grown strong enough to no longer be the caged birds that they once were as seen by their father and instead be strong enough to walk their own paths in life and find their destined loved one with this being supported well by the visuals for the ending. <br />
<br />
Voice acting-wise overall I felt that the series main voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main or support ones. In particular, I felt that Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, Inori Minase, Miku Itou, Ayana Taketatsu, Kana Hanazawa, and Ayane Sakura all did an excellent job at portraying the characters of Futaro, Itsuki, Miku, Nino, Ichika, and Yotsuba respectively. Ayana Taketatsu’s portrayal of Nino, in particular, was especially impressive with her transformation from classic Tsundere to lovesick maiden that’s determined to conquer her crush with all her might being especially praiseworthy. <br />
<br />
Overall conclusion <br />
<br />
In overall the second season of 5- Toubun no Hanayome I felt was an excellent anime that had among its main strong points in my opinion being its excellent premise, story, characters, music, and voice acting and served to not only make effective use of the foundation that the first season established but also expand upon it by leveraging not only how much the quints had improved themselves academically but emotionally as well via not only the stronger bonds that exist between the girls but also their sense of determination to not only find a path that they want to walk upon but also walk it with the one that they have wholeheartedly fallen in love with and in doing so take the first steps out of the cage that while necessary in the past in the eyes of their father is no longer so in the new lives that the girls now reside in for now they not only have each other but also something and someone that they can all work towards as they look towards the future. <br />
Overall as a final score, I would say that 5- Toubun no Hanayome’s second season easily deserves a final score of 9/10. <br />

    Overall: 8/10<br />
I was hesitating for the longest time between giving Quintessential Quintuplets a 7 or 8 overall, but reflecting back on some of this season’s biggest moments, I think its earned itself a respectable 8.<br />
<br />
Decent story, respectable MC, 4 best girls, 1 trash can (get Ichika outta here) and big boobs. Somehow, these elements came together to give us a highly anticipated sequel that actually delivered on everything the fanbase was looking for. So despite it’s mundane appearance, what makes this series so good, and in my opinion, much better than the first season?<br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
Rom-com formula 3.2 where MC met the love of their life

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386670">
        as a child but forgot them and/or meets them several years later. It ain&#039;t much but it&#039;s honest work. Honestly, I&#039;ve come to accept the fact 99% of rom-coms will have the same story. There&#039;s only so much you can do with this genre, even outside of anime. So can&#039;t really shit on Quintuplets for this. <br />
<br />
That being said, while the plot is rather straightforward, the pacing is actually quite good for a rom-com. Instead of beating around the bush, or diving straight into a relationship, we have pretty reasonable development leading up to big confessions from 2/3 of the quints, each of which carries enough weight and “hype” to get you excited to finally see it happen. I also applaud the anime for being able to appropriately skip certain scenes/moments from the manga without sacrificing pacing or development so the story can continue progressing at a good rate.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, since we know Fuutarou is bound to end up with one of the quintuplets, everyone’s just rooting for their best girl to win (honestly though, we all know the only quints who deserve it are Nino or Miku). <br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
At first, I wasn’t a big fan of the new art. But as the season dragged on, I actually came to realise how good it was, especially as I rewatched some clips from the first season. Although the higher quality faces/eyes and brighter, sharper colors might seem a bit unsettling first, I promise you’ll come to appreciate it after all 12 episodes.<br />
<br />
However, I gotta say I’m not a fan of the legs, especially the thighs we sacrificed to get this higher quality animation. It’s actually uncanny how skinny their legs are, and it seems way too unrealistic compared to before. Nevertheless, it’s a trivial matter and the overall art quality has taken a big step up from season 1 so props to the studio.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
I really like how even though the OP is totally new and unique, you can sorta pickup recurring themes and motifs from the score in the first season’s OP: that small sense of familiarity adds a lot in my opinion. Gotta say though, I don’t really like the ED and that shit’s an instant skip for me lmao.<br />
<br />
OP/ED aside, the OST is pretty good too, and well used to boot. We don’t have too much music overcrowding big/important moments, but when the OST is used, it’s used to great effect. Voice acting is also well done too, no complaints here.<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
As cliche and trope-heavy as the characters are, I actually think they’re done quite well for rom-com characters. Our MC is a bit dense, but for a different reason than you would expect. In Season 1, Fuutarou just straight up doesn’t care about the 5 hoes he’s tutoring. Therefore it makes sense he wouldn’t be able to tell them apart from each other, or recognize the growing feelings some of them have for him: he views this as a well-paying but incredibly boorish and stupid job he’s completing. It was only recently in season 2, that he decided this is something he likes doing and has started seeing the quints as more than just clients, but instead as friends. Most importantly, I like how awkward he is about love, but not clueless about it. After Nino’s confession, he’s clearly more aware of things but he’s not senseless about it, or openly sharing that information with the other quints either: I find it’s actually a very realistic representation of how a teenager would act after being confessed to and not knowing how to respond.<br />
<br />
As for the girls, they start off as very one-dimensional characters too. But overtime, mostly thanks to Fuutarou’s indirect actions and insistence on doing his job right, they start to mellow out and display tremendous character growth and development. Nino goes from hating this man to falling in love, and being the first of the 5 to openly confess to him. Miku has been struggling with self-confidence issues her whole life, heck even up to the final 2 episodes of this season, but has finally grown out of that shell and taken some big steps forward in pursuing her love. Not only is this character development well-paced and very reasonable, but it falls in line extremely well with the rest of the story and its pacing. Truly a job well done.<br />
<br />
Now, I’m on Team Nino because I find moderate tsunderes (like Nino is now) to be very attractive, probably also because I’m not a very assertive person in my relationship and like it when my girlfriend can take the lead instead. That being said, I can appreciate anyone rooting for any of the other girls not called Trashchika. Imagine shamelessly stopping to a level where you would sabotage and hurt your own siblings for something like your first love. WeirdChamp.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
Despite Quintessential Quintuplets’ mundane appearance and structure, there’s something about it that I find thoroughly enjoying. Maybe it’s watching these girls grow (minus Ichika for fucks sake) and become better people thanks to someone else. Maybe it’s watching a normal teenage guy trying to navigate things called “love” and “relationships” for the first time in his life. Quintessential Quintuplets takes all these average, beaten-to-death rom-com tropes and somehow manages to make them all work together, breathing some new life into an age old formula.<br />

    Normally I don&#039;t like the idea of these kinds of shows. Where girls, or guys all go after one person in a romantic interesting. But when it comes to this show, it&#039;s different, and it&#039;s that added difference that makes it far superior shows to others within that genre. Let me explain, as this is the second season, and<br />
<br />
Story and characters<br />
I&#039;ve put these two together, as it&#039;s the characters that really push it along. While they can seem like that each of them is a trope, one seems gloomy but isn&#039;t, one is more tsundere like, hell two even, one is very much an air

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376161">
        head etc, etc. But you won&#039;t mind those tropes so much as each of them blend well together to great a fun and entertaining show. With the kicker being that each of them are dumb in their own right, and of course need a tutor. While the MC, whom is their tutor, can also have his dumb qualities about him too, it&#039;s very enjoyable, and his sister is just precious. The reasons as to why I state these, is that the second season feels like we&#039;re carrying on from the first season, as if we never left it. Making us continue what we were enjoying previously. <br />
<br />
The story itself follows our MC in Fuutarou who has the task of tutoring these five girls, and gets paid doing so, which is great for him, as he needs it, as his family is struggling for money. But of course, things aren&#039;t always simple, and it&#039;s a challenge at first, and even later, which always keeps the viewer watching. If it all went simple for him, it wouldn&#039;t be an entertaining show now would it? The drama that goes on doesn&#039;t feel forced down our throats either, it feels reasonable, and well done. Along with it&#039;s twist at the end of the series, keeping us guessing in terms of the anime, of who he&#039;ll eventually end up with.<br />
<br />
Art and sound<br />
These two are pretty decent, while the art may look a little weird at times, but it&#039;s not too much of an issue, you&#039;ll soon forget about it, and appreciate the show for what it is. But besides that, the style is very colourful, along with being very fitting for each kind of scene. I always love the colours in the OP too, it&#039;s well done, along with the sound being fit for purpose depending on the scene, and really adding to the overall atmosphere of it all.<br />
<br />
Second season is starting off as great as the first, it&#039;ll feel like you never stopped watching the first season. So go watch it!

    I love watching romance/harem animes.<br />
But i don&#039;t know how people like those &#039;panty scenes&#039; and &#039;boob popping scenes&#039;.<br />
I dont know..i just feel gross in my guts.<br />
I wanted to watch a harem-romance anime with ...you know.. &#039;clean scenes&#039;.<br />
WELL HERE YOU GO!<br />
Actually its a lot better than i thought.<br />
The characters are very enjoyable and lovable.<br />
Well you can say its a cliche &quot;rich girl (here, GIRLS) fall in love with poor guy&quot;.<br />
BUT let me tell you something...CLICHES ARE IMPORTANT. If every other anime tries to become unique, you can&#039;t enjoy each...<br />
Its story is ok. Art is ok. EVERYTHING IS OK<br />
<br />
Just give it a shot. You will enjoy it.
