    My Hero Academia is no longer the 2nd coming of Hunter x Hunter. Rather, it is starting to look like the 2nd coming of Fairy Tail. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
We don&#039;t really have any plot or driving motion in the series anymore. The lack of build-up in former seasons is backfiring hard, and the pacing which is all over the place is not helping. The content itself is practically pure heroism for the sake of it, and heroes winning because they are the main characters. Really starting to look like it&#039;s made by Marvel. <br />
<br />
The new arc is really bad. First part of the &quot;training&quot; ending in 5

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280346">
        minutes without there being any content whatsoever. At least series like Yu Yu Hakusho --which did the same thing-- had different routes which people could choose within the forest. HxH did the same thing and it lasted 11 episodes and it was fantastic. Naruto did the same thing and introduced key plot elements and characters. In Hero Academia&#039;s case, there is no content behind it. All characters just use their trademark moves once. Literally nothing happens outside it. After a hard day of doing the said nothing, we get some manservice/fanservice, women and men bathing because apparently that&#039;s the point of this series now.<br />
<br />
I am afraid the word &quot;terrible&quot; is not even enough to describe the current writing. Fanservice fillers, romantic feelings used as a running gag. The main content is comedy. C o m e d y. Jokes that aren&#039;t funny at all. The pinnacle of the humor was a scene where dude ate cake while lifting weights. Thus far, the series has focused most on eating food. What type of a person writes FTS like this? This isn&#039;t shokugeki no souma... The series doesn&#039;t even look like it&#039;s based to a written story, more like seems to be some premade story macro which the author forgot to fill with content.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
While the characters are the reason why I am watching this show, they are being handled really poorly. Much like with the story, there is no development with the characters either. Unless we consider asspulled power control &quot;development&quot;. The filler where they act out of character and look like clowns is really not serving any of them. Does Bones not know what Source Fillmaker is? We literally don&#039;t need soft-core fanservice, thank you very much. <br />
<br />
Kacchan has been super annoying since the very beginning and looks like he is suffering the Sasuke-effect forever and always, much like that Bullet for my valentine song. It&#039;s so frustrating and unnecessary. Could they please develop him into a decent character already instead of making him look like the combination of Hulk and the main dude from Black Clover. So many of the rest of our heroes-in-training only radiate comedy, not characteristics. I don&#039;t like that very much.<br />
<br />
The villains are the best and the worst part. Really simple-minded characters who have basically no reason to do anything they are doing. Giggling evily because they so evil and whenever they do anything it&#039;s practically keikaku doori tier meme. At least they bring some interesting factors to the series and look cool, some even badass. They are supposed to be the half of this show, after all what are heroes without villains... Yet at the same time they seem to only exists for the heroes. Like in episodes 3-4 &quot;yo, we came here now because lol iunno we wanna scare you.&quot; This is not how you write villains. No matter how you look at it, the boss villain had no reason to send anyone there. Keikaku doori once again I guess.    <br />
<br />
The only character who gets thru any development is an angry kid who is mad at heroes.. hmmm. doesn&#039;t this sound familiar? Anyone remember the part where Sasuke and Naruto learned to control chakra with anti-gravity trees? Didn&#039;t we have this exact kid right there. In here, he is just so random it&#039;s almost as if the author thought he was cool in Naruto and wanted to put his own here.  He even says the same line &quot;like person like that exists&quot;. Believing all ninjas, oh sorry, I mean heroes are selfish. smh<br />
<br />
Art and sound:<br />
<br />
Bones has been putting effort into it and never stopped. It&#039;s the same as before and that&#039;s exactly how it should be. Of course, the series could use approximately 20 times less of those comedic relief scenes. Some nice songs are present, but there really should be more. Many of them don&#039;t really shine,. Especially the battle OST is there in the shadows behind prioritized voice acting. The OP song is really acquired taste tho. I like how it seems better every time I hear it. Voice acting is obviously identical.. outside the out of character filler where they acted like bunch of clowns, of course.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment::<br />
<br />
I like this show. I have always liked this show, but damn if I don&#039;t wish it was better. There is practically nothing new (currently) for a person such as myself who has seen all BTS series already. I can safely say that Hero Academia is currently being as bad as shonen series ever are. This isn&#039;t what the characters deserve at all.<br />

    I always considered mha for a mediocre enjoyable show. 60 episodes in and we had very little story progression and world building which is dissapoiting.<br />
<br />
Season 3 started of with a typical generic school trip. Few attempts of comedy here and there that simply didn&#039;t land. Other than that some todoroki development and deku vs muscular build up were only things worth seeing first 3 episodes.<br />
<br />
Characters training was much longer than it should have been. Wasted some time imo. Deku vs muscular fight was okay. The animation was great but again it was so generic and it lacked both creativity and choreography. No tactics used at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290363">
        all. It was just a flashy fight with 2 dudes punching each other with fists. I know, i know you are gonna say &quot;BuT MHa fIgHTs aRe ABouT StorY&quot; so is almost every fight in anime, that doesn&#039;t mean it should be mindless. On the plus side deku got some development. <br />
<br />
Am i the only one that noticed how repetitive mha is? <br />
Season 1 is basically characters training, villains invading<br />
season 2 is trounament arc, villains invading and finally season 3 is characters training and villains invading. There is nothing new. There is no bigger, deeper plot to get invested in to.<br />
Like always bunch of dumb villains that lack motivation appeared and i simply didn&#039;t care for them. There was that tsundare girl, that discount dead pool guy, mindless musuclar who is just killing for the sake of killing, that discount stain guy that was like a lizard or something, dude with big lips and uhhh what was his name again? That dude that&#039;s obviously todorokis brother or something. It&#039;s so predictable. On the plus side one thing that mha does good is the character desgins. Despite them looking goofy at times. At least they are memorable even tho the characters themselves aren&#039;t.<br />
Long story short students fight some villains and bakugo gets captured even tho bakugo clearly could have prevented it but he didn&#039;t because... he is a angry brat that wants to be acnkowladged.<br />
<br />
Next up is AFO vs All might fight... Again some good animation even tho there were some errors. We still don&#039;t know anything about AFO&#039;s motivation like with almost every vilalin in this show. He was supposed to be badass and his OST was supposed to be scary but it just wasn&#039;t. Not to mention his generic quirk... All might vs AFO was the peak of the season tho. It told the great story and it was good for all mights character. But we all knew all might was gonna win and he wins the most generic way possible. With final punch... The fight was dull from the actaul fighting perspective.<br />
<br />
This show is just too safe. There is no suspenese, we just know good guys are gonna win. Even when bakugo was kidnapped he got retrieaved at the end. Everyone was just injured and they recovered. Even tho all might is my favorite character, his death would have made this show so much better. <br />
<br />
Second arc was sooooooooo boring even tho it was filled with action. There was literally almost nothing big happening. There was a whole episode dedicated to rooms lmao. And again we get to the generic tournament arc with too many boring side cahracters that i don&#039;t care for. Mha is introducing too many, too fast. Side characters are very forgetable and the development is unievene. Even tho the cast is better than the terrible plot of this show it&#039;s still highly overrated. Too many bland characters with generic motivations and view points. Bakugo vs Deku was actaully good. I like bakugo more now even tho i still think his peronality is forced. Like why do you scream so much? I get that people had high expectations for you since birth but why so much? Tone it down ffs lmao. He is literally yelling at everyone around himself. It makes his personality unbelievable. The fight itself had the best choreography out of the 3. The animation was great too. &quot;The big 3&quot; was pretty overhyped. In temrs of character designs they are basically naruto, sasuke and sakura. Mirio is only one with potential out of the 3.<br />
<br />
The art style this season is basic like always. All in all mha is enjoyable show with terrible plot. This season has very little story progression. The show itself doesn&#039;t stand out in any way.<br />
<br />
P.S people are giving mha too much credit for executing the generic tropes well. It doesn&#039;t do it THAT well. It&#039;s a overstatement.

    After a great first season and a no less than fantastic second season My Hero Academia is back at it again with season 3, not even six months since season 2 ended. I wrote in my early review for season 2 that I was skeptical that it would be able to carry on being as well refined as season 1 was. Now that the second season is done there is no doubt that I was worried all for nothing. This is the exact thing I&#039;m feeling heading in to the third season of Hero Acca. I&#039;ll just sit back and enjoy the ride, cause I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280351">
        can already tell it&#039;ll be a good one. <br />
<br />
Story: Great (8)<br />
<br />
There isn&#039;t much that can be said about Hero Acca that hasn&#039;t been said already. The story is nothing really special in terms of its originality but it’s in the sheer polish and perfection of the tropes and standard shounen elements that Hero Acca shines. Season 1 we had the very standard, but brilliantly phased, origin story of our main hero as well as most of the lovable supporting cast. Season 2 we got the best god damn tournament arc I&#039;ve had the pleasure of beholding alongside the obligatory teacher-student-mastering-your-power-arc™ but adding some great curveball such as a whole new main villain which overshadowed most other antagonists not only in the show itself but most of the shounen genre. Season 3 has thus far only begun, but by a handful of episodes in we&#039;ve already set the groundwork for some of the best character interactions with the increased focus on Hero Class-B as well as the huge cast of newly introduced villains, some of which I hope can match Stain in either depth or impact. Sadly, it still gets points taken for lack of originality but since the show is clearly not going for being original at this point, I wouldn&#039;t say that its inherent lack of originality hurts the show as a whole. <br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation: Great (8)<br />
<br />
With dynamic movements that really feel like they&#039;ve got some weight behind them and fewer static panning shots than ever the general animation of Hero Acca remains as great as the previous season which itself was quite a leap up from the first season. I think that what truly makes Hero Acca look so nice is the lack of any major dips in animation quality generally found in most other anime. This consistency lets the viewer get deeper immersed in the show. Instead, Hero Acca has a tendency to suddenly spike in animation quality, seen many times during the previous seasons, especially season 2. I have no doubt in my mind that season 3 will deliver in that regard, partially confirmed by the fantastic fight scene in episode 4. It&#039;s really in the art department that Hero Acca suffers. Or rather, the background art and world that suffers. I&#039;ve mentioned the lack of originality of this show multiple times already, but never is it as apparent as when looking at the background art of Hero Acca. It could be replaced with the background art of most other shows and the average viewer wouldn&#039;t even know something had changed. This is a critique of Hero Acca in general, and not just season 3. <br />
<br />
Sound: Great (8)<br />
<br />
The voice acting is great as ever, delivering deep, believable emotions despite the language barrier. Neither sound design or soundtrack is really worth mentioning though since they&#039;re in all honesty pretty forgettable. The fact that I can&#039;t really remember any of the background music reinforces that statement. It works well enough for setting the right tone for the scene, but it simply doesn&#039;t stick with you when you&#039;ve finished the episode as some great soundtracks can. So, based on all of this how come sound still receives an 8? Simple. Because the OP and ED are kick ass, as usual. Rarely will a show keep me hooked from the very first second all the way until the screen fades to black. Not to mention the story that has been told continually through all the openings ever since the first season. I highly suggest you check out Mother&#039;s Basement&#039;s video on the topic. Hands down some of the best OPs and EDs out there.<br />
<br />
Characters: Fantastic (9)<br />
<br />
It&#039;s with its characters that Hero Acca always has shone brighter than most and the show shows no intent on giving up on developing its characters to a downright astounding point. If there’s one thing that most shows fail to do it would be to develop a character. While simply giving a character a believable motivation and one or two personalizing traits might seem enough at times that would not be good enough for Hero Acca. Not even as an introduction to a character. I could bring up the best episode of the series so far, Deku vs Todoroki in the Tournament arc (fight me) as an example of absolutely stunning implementation of character development but since that discussion rightfully belongs to a season 2 review, I’ll use a brand-new character as an example (light spoilers for ep 1-2 of season 3), Kouta Izumi who is probably the most interesting character of season 3 thus far. <br />
<br />
Kouta has a very complex heritage to deal with, being the son of two heroes called Water Hose who both died fighting the villain Muscular when he was very young. Because of his youth at the time of his parents’ passing he couldn’t quite understand the why and how of it all. He felt that they left him alone. This has caused Kouta to feel a deep distain towards not only heroes but hero culture as a whole. Without hero culture, his parents might still be alive. The complex part of this comes from his pure love towards his parents blended with his rage and hatred towards all that they represented. He’s too young to see that by spitting on hero culture, he doesn’t just disregard his parents’ ambitions and beliefs but also their love for him because there is no doubt that they did what they did every single day to keep others safe, to keep him safe. He has even gone as far as to set aside his quirk he inherited from them, thus disrespecting their very memory. The fact that he loved his parents more than anything while displaying such hate towards everything they stood for which for all intents and purposes hatred towards them directly. <br />
<br />
Koutas character reminds me of Todoroki and his until recently neglected quirk inherited from his father who he hated more than anything until Deku helped him realize his own person and who he intends to be and to step out of his father’s shadow, but if I got started on that again I’d be here all day. <br />
<br />
The groundwork laid down by the previous seasons of Hero Acca guarantees that most of the cast is as developed as they could possibly ever need to be but with the introduction of brand new villains and a greater focus on Hero Class 1-B there is plenty of work to be done still. Only time will tell what happens but if the past is anything to go by I’ve got nothing but excitement for this season. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Outstanding (10)<br />
<br />
I probably haven’t enjoyed a show as intently as Hero Acca Season 3 since well… Season 2 probably. The excitement I feel every time I fire up another episode can only be matched by shows such as Gurren Lagann and Mob Psycho 100. My eyes are glued to the screen from start to finish. I can go from sporting the widest grin or laughing along with the characters to feeling real despair or wiping away tears from my cheeks within the margin of a few minutes, all in pure enjoyment. This show made its well-deserved way to my top 5 nearly by pure heart alone. <br />
<br />
Overall: Fantastic (9)<br />
<br />
Hero Acca Season 3 stays on the same path as its previous seasons to become a great classic shounen. From a stellar story filled to the brim with polished and extremely enjoyable clichés to some of the most alive animation and fantastic openings and ending to hands down the most well-developed cast of its size I’ve ever seen. I love every single thing about Hero Acca, and season 3 looks to be nothing if not more Hero Acca!<br />

    (SPOILER WARNING FOR HUNTER X HUNTER, FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST, AND NARUTO + SHIPPUDEN)<br />
<br />
Season 3 is bad. It&#039;s the point where you finally realize that all the potential the earlier seasons flashed was no more than just that: unrealized potential. And all the problems with the writing weren’t blips, they become a constant problem that deflates the tension and drama in every arc.<br />
<br />
Every time Deku we’re told Deku is risking his body only for him to be fine after a day in the hospital, every time a villain is hyped up only for them to lose while barely accomplishing anything, every time stakes are established and then

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290580">
        retreated from immediately. It all starts to add up.<br />
<br />
Decline of Visuals 1<br />
<br />
Now, one thing that’s important to note is that the decline of the MHA anime is not entirely due to Horikoshi’s writing. A fair amount of blame should be attributed to Studio Bones, as well. I complimented the show based on how there was a lot more effort than I remember in season 1, and the reason I was surprised by that is because of how low the quality of visuals is in seasons 3 and 4. <br />
<br />
MHA’s visuals in general have never been that sharp (especially in terms of backgrounds), but season 1 did a good job of covering for that by being loose and creative with the visuals. That is no longer the case. The visuals are flat and the tone is overly stiff. Which uh, is a lot less fun to watch. And if you’re not enjoying what you’re watching, you tend to be less engaged. And when you’re not engaged by what’s in the foreground, you start to zone out and look at the backgrounds out of boredom.<br />
<br />
At which point, you start to notice how cheap-looking and shoddily thrown together the backgrounds in this show look. You’ll notice the same tree copy and pasted over and over again, stale coloring, buildings with no style or personality put into how they’re drawn, and sometimes you can’t even tell what you’re looking at. (I’d put a screenshot of a scene from episode 53 like I did on AL, but MAL’s decrepit review interface doesn’t allow for that. So instead, you get homework. Go to episode 53 at 9:00 and look at the wide shot of the city.)<br />
<br />
This is supposed to be an establishing shot of the city. What the hell is this? Looks like a bunch of digital garbage. <br />
<br />
(Now go to S3E53 at 4:00. AL has image embedding in their reviews btw. And video embedding! And proper formatting! Go read my review over there! @Bubblesssssss)<br />
<br />
What the hell are those things in the background even supposed to be? <br />
<br />
Forest Training Camp Arc<br />
<br />
The first two arcs of season 3 are the forest training camp arc and class raid arcs, and they are both very bad. So bad that season 3 (and really, the whole series) never recovers from it. What you realize while watching these arcs is that all the bad aspects of Horikoshi’s writing thus far aren’t going to go away: the problem has actually gotten much worse and is deflating any potential drama and tension for new arcs.<br />
<br />
The Forest Training Camp arc isn’t as bad as the Class Raid arc, but…its still bad and starts season 3 off on a very bad note. Most of why I dislike this arc is the emergence of Horikoshi’s writing becoming…lazy. The problems that pop up in the Class Raid arc are recurring issues that have spun out of control, but The Forest Training Camp arc started to make me question if he even had a plan for where the story is going.<br />
<br />
Here’s a brief summary:<br />
<br />
Students go on a class trip to train. Deku meets Kota, a kid who lost his parents and hates heroes as a result. Villains attack, Pixie Bob is injured, Deku fights this muscle guy and beats him, Bakugo gets kidnapped, arc end.<br />
There’s a lot of dumb shit all over the place here, but let’s start with the villain’s reason for the raid:<br />
<br />
“To make them see that their peace is resting in our hands” S3E41 13:10<br />
<br />
What the fuck does that mean? Something I’ve noticed while re-watching is with the villains, you kind of have to ignore what they say at times to make the writing coherent. Like with Stain when he says that money and fame worshippers are ruining hero society, despite there being sort of 1 example of each that fit that description even existing. What he does in the alley though, points to a more coherent ideology. Iida ignored an injured hero because he was too busy trying to get revenge on Stain for his brother. That selfishness and inability to control his emotions is bad and holds Iida back. You gave me an example of something Stain opposes directly and showed me rather than told me, excellent.<br />
<br />
And then you have this shit. I don’t know what the fuck “make them see that their peace is resting in our hands&quot; means. That’s confusing, vague nonsense. Later on, they explain that they want to kidnap Bakugo and try to show him that there are options other than being a hero. So why not just say that to begin with? You want to kidnap students to convert them to your cause. It conveys your motivations better than whatever the hell “make them see that their peace is resting in our hands” is.<br />
<br />
Anyways. Most of the villain attack is standard MHA stuff. Villains attack, have mixed results, students counterattack. Blah blah blah.<br />
<br />
The real garbage starts in the scene where Pixie Bob gets hurt. Here, Chatora starts talking about how the villains are bad because they hurt Pixie Bob because she’s apparently thinking about getting married, something that was never brought up until now.<br />
<br />
This is lazy, last minute garbage. Last-minute characterization is something I really don’t care much for, and MHA had done well to avoid this sort of lazy writing. This is literally just Horikoshi saying “Hey I know you barely got to know this character, but you should feel something because I’m abruptly telling you she’s getting married”. There’s no emotional anything here. I don’t know how important marriage is to her, I don’t know who she’s getting married to, I don’t know anything about this woman! If this plot line had been developed ahead of time (aka Horikoshi had scenes where we saw her doting over her fiancé, or just scenes of the 2 together in general), then there would be grounds to put this line here. Because then, the show would have actually earned it. But you can’t do it like this. This is lazy. We’ll get back to this problem in part 4, as it (like the other parts of Horikoshi’s writing) snowballs out of control.<br />
<br />
And then we get to the big fight from this arc, Deku vs muscle guy. I don’t care what his name is. His design is bad, he’s badly written, his only notable feature is how muscley he is. He’s muscley guy.<br />
<br />
Before getting to the fight, we need to talk about Kota. His parents are heroes that were killed in the line of duty, and he now he hates heroes. Which is whatever. Generic backstory, depends on what you do with it. It&#039;s fine by itself. But what I dislike about this is Deku’s reasons for wanting to help him. The show treats Kota as though his opinion about heroes is…wrong. Something that needs to be corrected. This is an annoying part of the way MHA is written, and is yet another problem that spirals out of control in seasons 3 and 4. On its own it isn’t a big deal. But when you take into consideration the fact that Horikoshi very clearly wants to write villains who represent problems with society, but at the same time is unwilling to write flawed superheroes or hold accountable UA or his society’s heroes, and also seems to treat all criticism of the heroes as wrong…like which is it? You can’t have both, they clash with each other.<br />
<br />
So obviously, this muscley guy is not a very good villain. Kota’s backstory with his parents was already pretty token, but did you really have to make muscley guy the same guy that killed his parents? That’s like the lamest twist ever. It was the first thing I thought of when I was guessing plot twists they might do in this arc. Never mind how infinitesimally small the odds of that same guy coming to attack this particular training camp, and just so happening to show up right in front of Kota and Deku are. It’s a lame thing to try to make a twist to begin with. It’s too obvious.<br />
<br />
Then you have the fight itself. Which is…whatever. There’s some neat animation here I guess, but overall I don’t care much. The villain is bad, the drama is bad, and there aren’t really any stakes with Deku injuring his body because I know after the arc is over, he’ll sit in a hospital bed for a bit and then be fine. Speaking of...<br />
<br />
Before we get to the episodes after the forest training camp arc, I&#039;d like to highlight one thing Deku says during this fight:<br />
<br />
From E42 15:40: &quot;a hero&#039;s job is to turn the lip service into reality&quot;<br />
<br />
Remember this quote. I&#039;ll refer back to it a lot going forward.<br />
<br />
Fake Stakes 1<br />
<br />
The episodes between the end of the Forest training camp arc and the class raid are important, in that they highlight the one problem with MHA that it has proven unable to escape from:<br />
<br />
Horikoshi is deathly afraid of taking risks. His writing is among the stalest and safest in a popular shounen I’ve ever seen. He’s overly attached to his characters, he never provides long-lasting consequences for the actions of his characters, and he seems terrified of moving a single piece out of place.<br />
There are 2 categories of this I’d like to highlight here:<br />
<br />
UA<br />
<br />
The first problem area when it comes to fakes stakes is this ongoing storyline with the media&#039;s criticism of UA and their failures to protect their students. Or rather, it’s just Horikoshi pretending there will be consequences for the students getting into trouble for both UA and the students, but then immediately retreating from it because actual consequences would be hard to write. Anyways, we&#039;re gonna establish the details of this subplot that are important, and I&#039;ll explain why this part of the story is a problem in a bit.<br />
In season 1, the media manages to sneak onto school grounds after Shigaraki blows up the wall. This one isn&#039;t as notable as the others, but I just wanted to point it out because in this instance, UA couldn&#039;t even keep reporters off their school grounds. Maybe a wall and sensor isn&#039;t a great security system in a world where nearly everyone has superpowers, yeah? You think maybe someone might try to just jump over the wall or blow it up?<br />
<br />
Anyways, then you have the villains that attack students at the end of season 1. Also does not reflect well on the school, and they receive criticism for it. This looks even worse when you consider the people that got in were proven to be morons. That&#039;s basically the subplot. The media goes after UA for letting the students fall into danger, and that&#039;s uh. That&#039;s it. As for the students:<br />
<br />
In episode 31, the police guy tells Deku and friends that they and the other heroes are going to receive strict punishment...and then they don&#039;t do that at all.<br />
<br />
Not a huge deal they don&#039;t follow through here. But next time they get into trouble, there needs to be actual punishment for the students or UA. This could just be to establish stakes for the future. All you gotta do is follow through next time.<br />
<br />
There you go, that&#039;s how all that...stuff is setup. The important part of this plotline is that somewhere along the line, the show has to be able to establish real consequences for UA for not protecting its students, and for the students of class A for getting into trouble. And...we&#039;ll get to that in a minute.<br />
<br />
Deku Destroying His Body<br />
<br />
Another recurring problem is Deku&#039;s body.<br />
<br />
The threat of Deku damaging his body so badly he can&#039;t be a hero anymore is established pretty early. It’s a good way of keeping One for All from feeling overpowered, and a constant source of drama during Deku&#039;s fights. At least, it would be. If Horikoshi was willing to actually commit to it. Knowing that Deku could permanently damage his body so badly he could never walk again is an interesting subplot, but it can&#039;t be if every time he risks his body, he stays in the hospital for a day and then he&#039;s fine again. This is, again, something that isn&#039;t a struggle for other popular battle shounens:<br />
<br />
We&#039;re back to Naruto and Hunter x Hunter again.<br />
<br />
In Naruto, when Rock Lee uses his Hidden Lotus ability, it has very similar risks to Deku&#039;s ability, with Lee&#039;s being a bit more extreme the further he goes with it.<br />
<br />
Anyways, when we see Deku and Rock Lee overuse their ability to try to win, we do see them exhausted, crippled, etc. But it’s what the writers do after the fight ends that separate the two.<br />
<br />
Rock Lee&#039;s body is torn up really badly after his fight with Gaara, and they tell Guy that it&#039;s likely he&#039;ll never fight again. But then, they follow through on that. He is absent from combat for the next 76 episodes, but it is a source of ongoing drama as we see his recovery process and struggle to come to terms with the possibly giving up his entire way of life. And then, several arcs later when he pops out to fight Kimimaro, you get a huge adrenaline rush. This happens for 3 reasons: one, Rock Lee was gone for so long. Two, the last time we saw him he was in the most entertaining fight of the show thus far. And most importantly three, we saw his recovery process and knew how hard it was for him. So when he jumps out here, we know that his recovery is complete, he&#039;s back as a ninja, and we finally get to see him fight again. Great moment, and a great example of establishing stakes for a fight and actually sticking with them.<br />
<br />
In Hunter x Hunter, Gon loses control of his emotions after he finds out Kite is dead. His anger leads him to use &quot;everything&quot; to kill Pitou. But since Gon is nowhere near strong enough to even fight Pitou, he has to sacrifice...well, everything. Based on what we know about nen and the way it works, seeing him suddenly obtain this much power means the amount he sacrificed is so great he will probably die.<br />
<br />
Okay, so our main character has taken on a colossal risk and the stakes are his sacrifice took a massive toll on his body, and he could die. How do we follow up on this?<br />
<br />
(This is where I would post the screenshot of Gon’s fucked up hand. But since MAL doesn&#039;t allow image embeds like AL does, go to the scene in episode 145 of Hunter x Hunter where Gon gets healed and look at his hand when its getting unwrapped by Killua.)<br />
<br />
This is what it looks like to create stakes and stick with them. Gon nearly dies, and Killua has to go through tons of hoops to save him. And while yes, Gon does recover. He is completely absent from the manga for the following arcs. No, really. The protagonist is out of the story for several major story arcs. He can&#039;t use nen because of what he did to beat Pitou. Kurapika is the main character during the prince succession arc, which is the current arc. Togashi was willing to take that risk to make it clear that when he declares stakes, no matter how great, he will follow through. As a result, when they say something like &quot;we could die”, I believe it regardless of who its referring to.<br />
<br />
And yet with Deku, we are told time and time again that he is risking his body by being reckless, and every single time he goes to the hospital, the nurse heals him, and he&#039;s fine again. There are no stakes here. Deku has the strongest plot armor on I&#039;ve ever seen.<br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t even that hard to fix either. Here&#039;s how you do it:<br />
<br />
Have the nurse heal him a couple times, then have the villains kill her; cutting Deku off from having an insta-heal every time he&#039;s reckless with his body. He will then be forced to actually deal with the damage he&#039;s doing to his body, and for the first time in the series actually following through with the stakes it established. It would also ground Deku, preventing him from just doing whatever he wants with no consequences.<br />
<br />
But killing the nurse lady would be a risky choice to make, and we can&#039;t have that!<br />
<br />
Or alternatively, stop reminding us of this plot point if you refuse to do anything with it. If you&#039;re gonna keep saying he&#039;s risking his body, then show the stakes! Have him damage his body so badly that he&#039;s absent for an arc. Naruto did it with Rock Lee. And Hunter x Hunter is doing it with Gon right now. The other guys don&#039;t seem to have a problem with it, and if MHA is as great as people say it is, Horikoshi shouldn&#039;t either.<br />
<br />
Class Raid Arc<br />
<br />
Now. The reason I brought up all of that now is because the episodes between the Forest Training Camp arc and the Class Raid arc are so fucking stupid, and it&#039;s because of the issues with the writing I just talked about. Deku suffers colossal damage to his body. He is up and walking immediately after. The heroes say that they&#039;re going to keep a closer eye on the students, and LITERALLY THE FUCKING NIGHT AFTER THEY SAY THIS, THEY LET THE STUDENTS SNEAK OUT. You even have the stupid fucking press conference the teachers put on, acknowledging all the criticism UA has rightfully gotten for putting its students in danger.<br />
<br />
AND AS THEY ARE SAYING THIS, NO ONE IS WATCHING THE INJURED STUDENTS AT ALL, SO THEY ALL SNEAK OUT.<br />
<br />
Do you remember this line I mentioned earlier?<br />
E42 15:40 &quot;a hero&#039;s job is to turn the lip service into reality&quot;<br />
<br />
This is My Hero Academy summarized in a single fucking line. Say you&#039;re gonna do one thing, and never follow through. It constantly contradicts the message of its own main theme because of its incompetent and lazy writing.<br />
&quot;Yes, we&#039;re taking the criticism seriously and are making changes&quot; as they are letting the students sneak out because no one bothered to keep an eye on them. Deku is threatened with losing his arms, and yet THE LITERAL DAY AFTER THE ATTACK, he sneaks out with the other students to go get Bakugo back! Ridiculous.<br />
<br />
And Iida understandably objects to this stupid ass plan, but since Horikoshi refuses to take a risk like slowing down for a bit to enforce the stakes he just established, Iida backs down and goes with them.<br />
<br />
This was the point where I could no longer deny the truth: My Hero Academy is a big piece of shit. Horikoshi is unable to establish any drama or stakes or tension due to his overly safe and lazy writing, and Studio Bones&#039; effort in its production has gone down significantly.<br />
<br />
It had another chance, though. It had one last chance to fix its villain problem. This could have done a lot to ease my growing irritation with the series. But again, it blew it.<br />
<br />
All for One, and Why the Villains Need to Kill<br />
<br />
So, a growing issue I have had with MHA is the villains. Like yes, they&#039;re bad. If we&#039;re keeping track of only the ones we&#039;ve seen so far, Shigaraki is an idiot (allegedly on purpose) and Stain doesn&#039;t accomplish much on-screen. That&#039;s in terms of writing though. Another big problem I have is that they never kill anyone.<br />
<br />
You see, when you have a problem with weak villains like MHA does, a great way to establish a new villain as a threat would be to show them killing a hero we know on screen. Not in the past, not telling us they kill people; actually showing them kill someone. This ties into my problem of Horikoshi being overly attached to his characters and not wanting to make sacrifices or take risks with them. Because there are tons of expendable ones.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the reason I bring this up now is because the class raid arc is where we are introduced to All for One, the Ying to All Might&#039;s Yang and supposedly the strongest villain there is. He has dozens of quirks stored away. He can use multiple quirks at once. This guy is a FORCE. So naturally, I&#039;m expecting him to have a big impact in his first appearance. After all, All for One is THE GUY. Finally, a competent villain! This is gonna be great!<br />
<br />
...Oh. Oh. (I would show screenshots of All for One getting punched and arrested here like I did on AL but MAL review interface lmao)<br />
<br />
All for One is disappointing for a number of reasons, but really All for One being disappointing is a backbreaker itself. He NEEDED to succeed, and needed to make an impression on the audience.<br />
<br />
The villains up to this point have been a joke. They also kinda just…always lose. Not every villain can just inflict &quot;psychological&quot; damage to the heroes or whatever. Its the battle shounen equivalent of a moral victory. That&#039;s what Shiggy did in season 1. His raid was a laughable failure that got him ridiculed by the students and All Might. Stain loses without killing anyone in season 2. Dude&#039;s name is literally &quot;Stain the Hero Killer&quot; yet we see him kill no one and then he gets arrested. Eventually, a villain needs to actually win. Succeed at their goal, outsmart the heroes, kill someone. Just something, so I can believe for once that there’s some competency to these dumbass villains.<br />
<br />
The most dangerous villain in the show has to establish themselves as a threat somehow when they show up. They can&#039;t just not kill anyone and get owned. Why? Because it makes them look incompetent, and that has a trickle-down effect on the other villains. You REALLY aren&#039;t going to take the other villains seriously. After all, if the biggest, baddest villain isn&#039;t allowed to win; if the heroes all have plot armor that can&#039;t be penetrated even now, ...what threat are the lesser villains? I see them as a joke now as a result of All for One&#039;s first appearance. His goal here is to kill All Might here. He does make All Might retire, but whatever. He still loses and gets captured. This is another moral victory.<br />
<br />
The best way to shock your audience and establish this guy would be to have him cut down a hero. It would be great! Hasn&#039;t happened before, so it would shock everyone. Horikoshi even has 3 excellent opportunities to do it.<br />
Obviously the preferred choice would be All Might. Him dying in a fight with All for One is a better way of inflicting fear admist uncertainty among the citizens for future arcs than him just retiring. And it would display vividly the ultimate act of what All Might says is the most important qualification for a hero:<br />
<br />
The spirit of self-sacrifice.<br />
<br />
It doesn&#039;t have to be him, though. Best Jeanist is incredibly expendable. He just took a massive shot to the gut. Why aren’t you killing him? Gran Torino is old and senile. They&#039;re so expendable and yet Horikoshi just...can&#039;t...let go of them.<br />
<br />
You kill Best Jeanist here, and the following fight with All Might suddenly becomes incredible tense. Why? Because when you kill a hero like that, it firmly establishes the stakes as life and death. Something, that was kinda not established during the season 1 raid, Stain arc from season 2, and the forest training camp arc. And, it would completely shock the audience, thus raising their investment. And that shit is important for a series like MHA.<br />
An important principle of being a hero in this series (and for…most battle shounens) is that they are fighting for their lives. As such, its important to establish that the stakes of fights are well, life and death. This is something I think My Hero Academy is trying to do.<br />
<br />
But without examples of heroes we know LOSING their lives fighting or just generally, its hard to really say the stakes are that high. We’re told that people could die, but we’re never shown it. Because all the heroes have plot armor. They aren&#039;t allowed to die because they&#039;re heroes. Why? Horikoshi is unwilling to take risks. And no, heroes that died before the show starts don&#039;t count. Heroes we know and that have been established, that we&#039;ve seen in the series, dying. That&#039;s what it is needed.<br />
<br />
This is, again, something writers of other popular battle shounens understand. Let’s knock these down quick, I don’t need a paragraph to explain each:<br />
<br />
Hunter x Hunter:<br />
<br />
Everyone Hisoka kills during the Hunter exams: establishes Hisoka as a serious threat and that the Hunter exam is very much life or death, which is very much true.<br />
<br />
Ponzu and Pokkle: displays how ruthless and cruel the chimera ants can be.<br />
<br />
Kite: Juxtaposed with how Kite wiped out an entire squadron with one swing earlier, establishes how unbelievably strong the Royal Guard are.<br />
<br />
Those 2 dudes at the beginning of the Zoldyck arc that get killed by Mike: establishes up front how dangerous the Zoldyck manor is.<br />
<br />
Fullmetal Alchemist:<br />
<br />
Hughes: this is a message from the Homonculi to the audience and the Elric brothers: if you keep snooping around, we&#039;ll kill you.<br />
<br />
Basque Grand: makes it clear that Scar can kill any state alchemist if he gets the opportunity and Edward and Alphonse are not safe.<br />
<br />
Naruto: <br />
<br />
Jiraiya: establishes Pain as a huge threat. He just killed one of the legendary sanin for fuck’s sake.<br />
<br />
Gaara mercilessly slaughtering those rain ninja in the forest of death and killing Dosu: establishes deadly stakes for the fight vs Rock Lee and vs Sasuke, respectively.<br />
<br />
Orochimaru kills Hirouzen: makes it clear how dangerous he is, and more importantly makes the audience worry about what&#039;s going to happen when Sasuke decides to chase after him. &quot;Oh, shit. that guy killed the hokage. And Sasuke&#039;s going to go with him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stuff like this sends a message, and its usually pretty good at scaring the audience if they’re invested. When a villain kills someone, it says “this could happen to one of the protagonists if they aren’t careful”. <br />
<br />
Killing a character is an amazing way to establish danger, something that MHA sorely lacks at this point due to how shit the villains are and how safe the writing is. This is especially true here, because it ruins what could be a genuinely great fight. On paper, the way it&#039;s set up works. But to once again have no one die and the villain lose despite setting the stakes higher than ever? That just can&#039;t happen here.<br />
<br />
In Between Arcs 1/Fake Stakes 2<br />
<br />
Now hold on just a minute. Because everything I complained about in the Fake Stakes sections immediately comes back again after the All for One vs All Might fight.<br />
<br />
During the first half of episode 50, All Might yells at Deku for destroying his body and sneaking out even though All Might and the other dumbass teachers weren&#039;t watching the students, and thus let it happen. Also, Deku is fine after all that. Walks away with some bandages.<br />
<br />
In the second half of episode 50, Deku&#039;s mom takes a stand against All Might and UA for continuously allowing them to endanger her son, and threatens to pull Deku out of UA. This, of course, does not happen. All Might begs and she gives up. The show declares stakes in the form of consequences for a student and UA, and this is again retreated from in the same scene.<br />
<br />
E42 15:40 &quot;a hero&#039;s job is to turn the lip service into reality&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite episode 50 focusing on the fallout from the class raid for UA and the students, including showing several parents of class A students angry with the school...not one of those parents pulls their kid out. So, no consequences of any kind for anyone. The most we get is that UA has a dorm system now. Ugh.<br />
<br />
Later in this same episode, Eraser says that he would&#039;ve expelled almost all of them if not for All Might&#039;s retirement. The fuck does All Might&#039;s retirement have to do with anything? Just expel them. All Might&#039;s retirement is just a lazy excuse to not follow through with stakes you yourself established. Stop being lazy and taking shortcuts with the writing. You keep saying you&#039;re going to do one thing, and then you don&#039;t because you&#039;re scared of the risk. As I recall, that seems to contradict what you said earlier:<br />
<br />
 E42 15:40 &quot;a hero&#039;s job is to turn the lip service into reality&quot;<br />
<br />
Provisional Hero License Exam<br />
<br />
And finally, we have the last arc from season 3. Like usual, we start with the stakes:<br />
<br />
S3E53 &quot;the Provisional License Exam has a 50% fail rate&quot;<br />
<br />
That’s actually pretty intense! Sure hope they don’t immediately retreat from that after the exam like they always do.<br />
<br />
Overall, this arc is…bleh. I think its main problem is that it feels like it goes on forever, and due to the repetitive plot structure this just feels like the 10,000,000th exam stage. I don&#039;t believe you about the stakes. Deku will be fine no matter what they do. None of this matters. I’m not invested anymore.<br />
<br />
I think the training camp and Bakugo retrieval arcs were just so bad that the show can&#039;t recover now. I am actively irritated with the show. Also, the tone is incredibly tiresome and stiff now. I miss the loose feel of season 1, where All Might swore in front of Deku and it didn&#039;t take itself as seriously as a heart attack.<br />
<br />
Seeing the number one hero in the world, the symbol of peace, swear in front of a young kid is hilarious. Made you feel like at least part of his hero persona was a front that he put on. As such, he felt a bit more human. I liked that side of him. I don&#039;t really like him at all now. He&#039;s boring. This exam stage in particular is really fucking boring. They&#039;re doing a little with making the people they&#039;re supposed to be rescuing assholes, but it isn&#039;t enough.<br />
<br />
Fake Stakes<br />
<br />
Oh, and guess what? Just like I said, they waved off the stakes. Those who failed can take a 3 month course to get their provisional licenses anyways.<br />
Since this is now a problem I can&#039;t ignore, I&#039;ll address it here. One of the biggest offenders of fake stakes in this series is the exam stages. Horikoshi has a crippling habit of creating stakes for the students during exams, only to backtrack as quickly as possible once the arc is over.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
In episode 5, Aizawa threatened to expel the student that scored the lowest on an entrance exam. This is quickly retreated from the next episode. Not a big deal that they backed away from it here. Just make sure you follow through next time, that way I can believe there&#039;s actual stakes to these exams.<br />
<br />
In episode 38, the students are threatened with having to go to summer school if they fail.<br />
<br />
This is again, retreated from after the arc ends. Now it’s a problem. Because twice now, you have declared there to be stakes via consequences for failing or performing poorly in an exam, and both times you failed to follow through. There will be more examples later. So, why is this bad?<br />
<br />
Because 1, I don&#039;t believe the show when it tells me there will be consequences when someone fails. Because there never are. Be it the students getting into trouble, UA failing to protect its students, or something as simple as student failing an exam. You always retreat from it afterwards. And because of that, I&#039;m less engaged during exams. After all, there are no stakes because Horikoshi insists on giving plot armor to everyone in class A.<br />
And 2, because its supposed to be difficult to get through UA, right? After all, they tell us that as early as episode 4.<br />
<br />
Like a lot of things the show does, this is telling without showing. The show will tell us it is difficult to get through UA, but it really isn&#039;t at all. The school bends over backwards constantly to keep students from failing. This is not really something that should be a struggle for a battle shounen at all, at least if you&#039;re a writer that&#039;s willing to take risks. Want some examples?<br />
<br />
Let’s look at the Hunter exam from Hunter x Hunter and the chuunin exams from Naruto. These are basically the same thing as the exams the characters go through in UA. To become a pro hunter/ninja, you have to pass these exams. Naruto and Hunter x Hunter want you to know that these tests are difficult and making it through is a significant is a huge feat. So how do Kishimoto and Togashi support it?<br />
<br />
Uh, by having people fail. A LOT of entrants fail in both the chuunin exams and Hunter exams. And not scrubs, either. One of the main characters fails the first time in Hunter x Hunter, and most of the entrants that you end up spending most of the show with end up failing in Naruto.<br />
<br />
As for as numbers go:<br />
<br />
Most of the characters lose before the finals, including main characters (Sakura, Ino, Rock Lee, Kiba, Hinata, Choji, Tenten). Killua fails in Hunter x Hunter. if you look at insignificant characters, all but 7 failed the hunter exam. 400+ examinees failed. In the chuunin exams, hundreds failed as well. There were only 5 genin remaining when the Konoha Crush interrupts the exams. (Failing is a bit different in Naruto. You can lose in the finals and still become a chuunin). Why does this matter?<br />
<br />
Because part of the point of having these exams in the first place is to make it clear how difficult it is to become a shinobi/hunter. People need to fail out so 1, the threat of characters failing is established. 2, to establish stakes. and 3, establish the extreme level of difficulty to accomplish the goal, for the purposes of making the task seem daunting (which will be a constant source of drama), and to make those that have accomplished it (in this case the pro heroes) worthy of respect for having reached it.<br />
<br />
Hunter x Hunter and Naruto wanted their exam stages to seem difficult and intense, so they supported it by being willing to have characters fail. It’s really that simple. Kishimoto and Togashi as writers are willing to take those risks to make their manga better. Horikoshi is not.<br />
<br />
Class B<br />
<br />
Another example of fake exam stakes that annoys me is how they keep telling us that if class A trips up, students from class B could replace them. This is another good source of drama, and adds even more stakes for the class A students. But like all the other stakes, the show never follows through with it.<br />
<br />
I really wish they would too, because there are some weak characters in class A I really wish would get cut out. Like the animal guy, and the tail guy, and especially the tape guy. He&#039;s boring and his power is boring. Get rid of him. I would love for Horikoshi to take a risk and move one of these boring dorks out for someone like Shinso, but Horikoshi is again too afraid to move even a single character out of place for some reason.<br />
<br />
So once again, you say this one thing will happen, and then retreat from it afterwards. You never follow through with what you say you’re gonna do, which, again, contradicts this:<br />
<br />
***E42 15:40 &quot;a hero&#039;s job is to turn the lip service into reality&quot;<br />
<br />
Deku vs Bakugo<br />
<br />
Capping off season 3, we have Deku vs Bakugo. And look. I know people think this fight is amazing. And…I mean it could be. If it was organic to the narrative, had stakes, and wasn’t forced into a place in the story it doesn’t belong. The problem I have with this fight is it doesn&#039;t represent a moment where past and/or current differences and philosophies collide naturally due to the narrative. The show is pausing its story to have this fight. <br />
<br />
Deku vs Bakugo is MHA&#039;s version of Naruto vs Sasuke. But with Naruto vs Sasuke, it was very much the right time for that fight, and there were real stakes. Sasuke wants to go off and join Orochimaru to gain power, but Naruto knows and we as an audience know that Orochimaru only wants to use Sasuke as a vessel to switch bodies. And while you might think Sasuke can handle himself, …we watched Orochimaru kill a hokage earlier. (One of the benefits of killing off characters btw). So we know he is a serious threat to kill Sasuke. That&#039;s the kind of stakes and emotional drama you need for a fight between main characters. Which is what I think this fight lacks.<br />
<br />
Granted, there isn&#039;t really a rule to how you write a fight like this. And I&#039;m not really advocating for it to just do what Naruto did. It isn&#039;t a bad fight. I just think you need a little more here. Something to be lost for Deku when he&#039;s defeated. And have it be written more organically into the story, rather than shoving it awkwardly between arcs.<br />
<br />
In Between Arcs 2/End of Season 3<br />
<br />
We end season 3 with episode 62. The first half of it is looking into the idea of how All Might’s retirement is affecting normal citizens. This is, of course, a very good idea. As the show hasn’t really put any effort into humanizing the citizens so we gave a shit when villains attack and put their lives in danger. It also is the start of the idea that Endeavor doesn’t really work as an All Might replacement. He lacks the charisma and people just don’t react to him the same way. It’s…interesting. And they follow up on it later. Uh, good stuff.<br />
<br />
The second half is more fake stakes for Deku’s body and consequences after his fight with Bakugo. Deku is fine, again. Deku and Bakugo broke curfew, destroyed a bunch of shit, fought, and their only punishment is they have to clean more. Really? After sneaking out during the class raid? Have the teachers at UA learned absolutely nothing this entire time?<br />
<br />
Big three arrives, season over.

    The beloved shounen series is back again, adapting some of the manga’s finest arcs. <br />
<br />
Although it starts with a slightly unnecessary, but well-handled recap episode, it gets right to the story afterwards, starting off with some cool set-up and character moments. Then, things get serious. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, villains are everywhere, putting everyone to a test. <br />
<br />
What is so loveable about shounen is the theme of not giving up and pushing to the limit, overcoming your obstacles no matter how great they are. Which BNHA exemplifies. On one side with the battles themselves. Especially the fight between Izuku and the physically superior Muscular will have you hyped,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280350">
        with its awesome visuals, set-up and epic sound. On the other side with the characters. <br />
<br />
In the first arc of the season, multiple characters get a lot more time to shine, showing what they are made of. So we get to see them use their powers more and work together. Aside from that, class B also gets a spotlight on them after they were introduced in Season 2. Not forgetting to mention the cool villains, each of them unique and promising, with special mention here to Toga, Twice and Dabi. It’s so great to see everyone getting moments of character. The large cast of BNHA has always been entertaining due to its diversity and organic feeling, mostly with all the interactions taking place between classmates. All of the characters are likeable and quirky, but they are also distinct and unique in their own way. <br />
<br />
The animation is on point again with its artstyle, cinematography and most appealing of all: the simply awesome fights. Studio Bones reminds us again what they are known for. <br />
<br />
As for the opening, it took a little while to get used to. However, it still has some great visuals and a track that will be in the playlists of many fans, even if the two of them don’t seem to mix together at first. The ending is loveable and cute, giving some nice time spent with everyone in manga panel style. However, let’s not forget the epic music that plays at the moments it counts. You know, the moments that will stick out in our memories. <br />
<br />
There were moments that made my heart race. I’m enjoying the anime thoroughly, and will see it through towards the finale, expecting to see more of what we love about Boku no Hero Academia. <br />

    Before this, I would recommend reading my reviews of the first two seasons of Boku no Hero Academia. Many details that explain my opinion on this series in a broader sense are already covered there.<br />
<br />
This season picks up where the previous season left off, with the students preparing to go to an inevitably doomed summer training camp. The plot takes a much darker tone this season, with The League of Villains newly-emboldened by Stain&#039;s actions in season 2, and full of fresh faces. The first arc of this season gives the new villains a chance to show off what they&#039;re made of, and set up

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290341">
        the league as a more immediate, tangible threat.<br />
<br />
Without spoiling too much, the following arc goes even further into developing The League of Villains, finally introducing their leader and revealing his true plan. It also sets up for a changing of the guard for both the heroes and the villains, building towards Deku and Shigaraki becoming arch-enemies in the vein of their mentors.<br />
<br />
While these two arcs excel due to their establishing a greater cast of villains and creating a sense of genuine threat, the following arc doesn&#039;t fare quite as well. The Provisional License Exam arc doesn&#039;t serve much purpose in the overarching plot other than to get the story from point A to point B. While there is some exploration of Todoroki&#039;s grudge against his father, this isn&#039;t anything we haven&#039;t already covered elsewhere. Ultimately, without it being as firmly rooted in the emotional journey of its characters, it has a lot less substance than the other arcs, and feels awkward and transitionary.<br />
<br />
This is exacerbated by some uncharacteristically bad pacing for this series, with two filler episodes sandwiched into it along with some added scenes and dialogue, presumably included to make sure that the season ended at a good point rather than smack in the middle of another arc.<br />
<br />
While one of the two filler episodes (technically three, but the first was a start-of-season recap) follows a similar idea to season 2&#039;s surprisingly good filler episode, in covering events that happened offscreen to secondary 1-A characters, the other is a completely unnecessary waste of time that accomplishes little more than plugging the movie. And even the better of the two fails to repeat the same success of season 2&#039;s filler, partially because while the previous one came as a breather episode inbetween story arcs, this one directly interrupted the plot in progress. It also doesn&#039;t help that Tsuyu is a better character than Yaoyorozu (fight me, nerds).<br />
<br />
The writing is also noticeably worse during filler, in particular for Uraraka and Bakugo. Uraraka gets a lot of screentime in additional scenes, but almost all of her dialogue in these scenes revolves around her uncertainty around her feelings for Deku, something we had already established and which didn&#039;t need repeating ad nauseam. Bakugo on the other hand plays up all his worst character traits in the movie-plugging filler episode, but where his recklessness in canon is usually due to his anger and frustration with Deku, here it&#039;s pure idiocy.<br />
<br />
Once the exam is over, however, the quality immediately picks back up. And whatever disservice the filler may have done for Bakugo, it&#039;s easily forgotten after he gets some long overdue character development. While Bakugo was never a bad character, he wasn&#039;t a likeable one either. But Bakugo&#039;s character arc has been long in process - with his entire worldview being flipped on its head the moment Deku gained a quirk, Bakugo has been challenged with the thought that he&#039;s no longer superior to everyone around him - a belief that he had always taken for granted until then. This season finally takes this setup and brings it to a conclusion redeeming an oft-maligned character in the process.<br />
<br />
Overall, while the quality of this season does take a noticeable dip during the provisional license exam, even then it isn&#039;t bad - just underwhelming in comparison. Outside of this arc, it matches (and in places exceeds) the benchmark the previous season set.<br />
<br />
And for any mistakes the series may make, it still manages to retain investment in both the ever-evolving setting and its quirky (pun not intended) ensemble cast, the latter in particular benefiting not only from more character arcs, drama, and development, but from increased downtime letting us see more of these characters outside of their roles in the plot, fleshing out more of their personalities and character dynamics.<br />
<br />
With the series ending on a foreboding note, Hero Academia promises great things to come - but for now, Hero Academia 3 is an impressive, if uneven, entry in the series.<br />
<br />
Story/Plot: 7/10<br />
Characters: 9/10<br />
Animation/Art: 9/10<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
<br />
Overall: 7/10<br />
<br />

    Superhero stories feels like it’s been populating the entertainment industry from these recent years. Marvel and DC successfully adapted many of these superhero tales with huge fanbases. The CW Network have aired shows with a large following like The Flash, Arrow, Supergirl, and Legends of Tomorrow. My Hero Academia always reminds me that it has a place with its own set of superheroes and villains. With that in mind, I was pretty ecstatic about the return of My Hero Academia.<br />
<br />
The third season does a bit of recapping at first to get viewers comfortable with its characters, story setting, and general concepts. As someone who has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290330">
        been following both the anime and manga, I knew what was to expect as the series is structured with story arcs. From the first half of the show, we follow Class 1-A as the first semester at U.A has concluded. Known as the “Forest Training Camp Arc”, it details the events of our young heroes participating in a training camp. They are supervised by a hero group known as the Pussycats but incidents happen that leads the arc into quite a chaos. It’s no surprise either as My Hero Academia likes to build tension and make story with its characters. From the Training Camp arc, we are introduced to a character named Kota who has a distasteful view towards heroes. The show explores his reasons for this while also adapts how he begins to change after meeting certain people. Enter Deku. He is pretty much symbolic for what Kota detests because of his values and desire to become a hero. The arc details of what it really means of being a hero and opening his eyes to reality.<br />
<br />
Moving on, it’s also clear that the series has dangerous adversaries for the heroes to face. The League of Villains has been teased from season 2 and in this season, they make themselves known with malicious intentions. Their core members exposes the dangers our heroes faces but they also have a hidden agenda. That brings into the question of a guy named Katsuki Bakugo. You’d remember him as the arrogant guy who always strives to be the best with a huge ego. From this season, you’ll also see what it means to be a hero from his point of view. Nonetheless, I think there may be an overemphasis on the idea of making heroes. Every episode and arc dedicates an immense amount of time to such concepts that sometimes, I wonder if there’s just too much. I say this because after a certain amount of episodes, the storytelling feels a bit redundant without much development. Heroism becomes too symbolic even in the case of All Might. On the contrary, one could also mention that All Might is a symbol of being a real hero. He represents courage, integrity, peace, and self-sacrifice. The apex of the show has him battle out against a powerful enemy from the past that draws out perhaps one of the most important episodes of the franchise. While still overemphasizing the idea of heroism, it’s significant enough to prove what being a hero is all about.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the series still has its sense of humor. There exists many moments in the show that offers to delivery comedy ranging from Mineta’s ridiculous perverted antics to an episode about checking out everyone’s rooms. Bringing back to the main plot, the second half of the show features the hero license exams and internship arc together. It now transcends from young heroes to take their next step in following their dreams. New characters are introduced while familiar ones are bought back together to add to the drama. It also adds bits of tense rivalry between certain characters that may or may not be pleasing to remember. But I must say, preparing these heroes in such a way feels like the pacing could have been improved. I’m not a big fan for the latter half of the show as most of those episodes didn’t make much of an impact. Even in terms of personal enjoyment, I find myself losing interest when watching Deku, Bakugo, Momo, Todoroki, Enji, Tenya, Ochaco, or others compete to earn their spot. Some of the new characters like Mei did occasionally spark my interest but nonetheless felt underwhelming. What about the new characters like the ones from Shiketsu High School? To me, they’re unique individually but lacks development and isn’t well crafted enough for true appeal. I’m not going to lie, it felt like the show sometimes has too many characters in a story arc at once and doesn’t really bring out their true potentials.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, I guess you may be asking if character relationships develop further in this season. It definitely proves itself being able to capitalize on the complex relationship such as with Deku and Bakugo, Deku and All Might, or Deku and Koda. But for other characters like Ochaco, they really take a pitfall. There’s obvious romance that blooms from her towards Deku but the season acts more like a ship tease with no true hope of sailing sail. Never say never though, right? Just not this season.<br />
<br />
Coming back to this franchise definitely reminded of the Shounen Jump action I was looking for. A superhero action series like this isn’t complete without its colorful character cast and their action roles. It offers all sort of characteristics where every hero or villain is unique. However, it may be noticable that some episodes dropped in quality compared to previous seasons. Yoshihiko Umakoshi worked on a variety of roles from previous seasons ranging from character designs, chief animation director, and key animation. In this season, he’s absent as a role of animation director. That doesn’t mean the third season fell apart though because in some of the more climatic episodes, there’s definitely high quality animation. The explosiveness and energy of the fighting scenes from some of the more important episodes really are worth praising. There’s also the dynamic character motions with emotional content that adds more value to many scenes this season. There’s even environmental physics and other background animation that are worth paying attention to. To me, I think My Hero Academia Season 3 started off a bit slow but was able to work itself up again to bring these storybook characters to stardom. The familiarity of the soundtrack also brings together moments that you won’t forget. <br />
<br />
After three seasons of My Hero Academia, I think it’s safe to say that the momentum of this roller-coaster isn’t going to stop for a good while. Superhero shows often portray characters as exactly what they are – a symbol of justice and peace. While My Hero Academia does continue to follow that concept, it has moments that truly capitalizes on the meaning of this ideology. With more episodes on the way in the future, I still have bright hopes for this franchise.

    I do not like Boku no Hero Academia. <br />
<br />
Boku no Hero Academia is probably the most popular anime of recent years and is widely regarded as a great series. But I’ve never understood the hype. There are familiar characters with dull motivations and extremely boring humor. BnHA is pretty much 50 percent &quot;comedy&quot; comedy with BIG quotation marks and 50 percent fights. I&#039;d like to explain why I think BnHA fails in both of these departments in this review.<br />
<br />
The Fights <br />
I&#039;ll be comparing an anime with fantastic fights: Hunter x Hunter with those in Boku no Hero Academia in these segment so if you haven&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282771">
        seen Hunter x Hunter, what are you doing? watch it. But the second part might not be as relevant to you if you for some reason haven&#039;t seen it<br />
<br />
The fights in BnHA aren’t good. There are no brains used in any of the fights. In the end, it’s always the one that punched harder that’s victorious in the end. There’s this one fight in season 2 where Uraraka actually uses her smarts to try and win against Bakugo. Her plan succeeded, but she still lost because Bakugo used his power harder. I’ve seen many comparisons between Boku no Hero Academia and Hunter x Hunter. I also don’t really get these, because Hunter x Hunter is one of the best animes ever made. BnHA is not. Let’s just compare the fights.<br />
<br />
Fights in Hunter x Hunter are always extremely thought-out and mentally challenges our heroes. The fights always have a setup and a point either to prove how much stronger a character has become by doing something that they couldn’t do before. Some fights can start whole character arcs. One fight that started an arc was when Gon first encountered Hisoka during the Hunter exam arc. While Gon was trying to steal his numbered plate Hisoka just knocked him to the ground in one punch. He then gave his plate to Gon either way and said: “I’ll let you keep it till’ you can punch me like that”. And then many episodes later when Gon lands his first Punch and finally lets Hisoka have his plate back is SO satisfying. And that’s only because this fight had a long setup and gave the characters good motivation. The first fight between Hisoka and Gon is just one of many examples of great fights in Hunter x Hunter.<br />
<br />
I’ve already talked a bit about the fights in BnHA so imma keep this shorter. I just want to make the point that the fights in BnHA are nearly the exact opposite of those in Hunter x Hunter. The fights are mindless and dull and the characters don&#039;t have real motivation to beat the shit out of each other more than that one of them is good and the other is bad. In most cases, some sort of motivation is revealed during the fight but not before to give the characters some motivation to fight in the first place. Often you don’t even know who the villain is before the fight has started. But then they reveal something like “I killed your parents” or something in the like. There’s one more thing that REALLY bugs me off about the BnHA fights. And that is those goddamn speeches in the middle of the fights that everyone has. Like when he stands there screaming some generic nonsense, JUST PUNCH HIM. In almost every fight Deku looks down at the ground talking silently. Then we get a shot of him clenching his fist, then looking up and starting to scream before getting some power boost. And the villain just stands there and listens to him talk about how All Might gave him his chance in life or whatever. Deku could be so beat that both of his arms could be broken and he barely could stand. But after holding a speech he magically beats the bad guy. Maybe Deku wasn’t quirkless after all. <br />
<br />
The art in both of these animes is actually quite amazing. That’s the one thing I will give to BnHA, it’s visually pleasing. Both have very good character designs that make the characters stand out and you can clearly understand at least a bit of the character just by looking at them. <br />
<br />
The comedy<br />
<br />
BnHA is one example of the most boring comedy in an anime that I’ve ever watched. Between the dull fights, our other boring characters interact with each other. And they often lean on this pervert for comedic value. But it’s just not funny. It really cannot get a smile out of me. I’ve never liked the slapstick kind of comedy. I don&#039;t find it funny when people get hurt or get extreme nose bleeds because one of the female cast members are in a bikini. I find the friendly banter between the characters in Hunter x Hunter to be much more effective. Between the fights in this much better shonen are there most often interactions between our four main characters. And these scenes actually make us believe that they are friends and have an honest to god relationship. They fight with each other, joke and laugh things real friends do. <br />
People always say that humor is subjective, and I beg to differ. Humor is not subjective, but what YOU find funny is. If you have ever watched an interview with a comedian then you can easily tell that all of them have plans and tactics on how to make you laugh. In the simplest form, you have to have a set-up and a pay off to make a joke that some people find funny. They either tell a story before the punchline or make a call-back to something they said before. This is where Boku no Hero Academias&#039; comedy fails. There&#039;s no set-up and barely any payoff to any of the jokes (there are a few exceptions tho). The characters just make a funny face and scream loudly, that&#039;s comedy for you. The comedy is on Instagram-comedians level for god&#039;s sake. And just the fact half, if not more of the time is spent on this godawful comedy is mindboggling to me.   <br />
<br />
In conclusion, writing this review has made me realize how much I like Hunter x Hunter but also how much I dislike Boku no Hero Academia. So if you wanna take something from this review, watch or rewatch Hunter x Hunter. :)  <br />

    Hero Academia&#039;s poor character development has ruined an otherwise engaging story. <br />
<br />
If you enjoyed the first 2 seasons in spite of a few absurd story arcs and silly character development, and you&#039;re willing to overlook poorly thought out character motivations for the sake of grand themes of heroism then you might be able to enjoy and even fully embrace season 3. I disliked the nonsensical villain motivations in Season 2 and I feel that their motivations seem to make even less sense in Season 3.<br />
<br />
Since Season 2, we have seen that most of Hero Academia&#039;s villains want to kill All Might because he happens to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280393">
        be the so called &quot;symbol of peace&quot;. Why would any villain want to kill the &quot;symbol of peace&quot;? According to Hero Academia, villains want to kill the symbol of peace because they want to deprive Japanese citizens of the hope that any hero can save them from any kind of danger at any moment in time. By the way, we don&#039;t really know if any country other than Japan actually exists in this fictional superhero and that just makes suspending one&#039;s disbelieve a little harder needs to be. <br />
<br />
How exactly does a villain materially or emotionally benefit from depriving people of the hope that All Might or any other hero can save them at any point in time? How does killing All Might or any of the students of UA high satisfy a villain&#039;s emotional or physical needs? None of these important thematic questions are ever answered. The sad fact is that almost all of the villains have motives that conveniently push the plot forward and create some much needed suspense and tension. But in their attempt to kill All Might and UA students, the villains have sacrificed their physical well-being and their emotional needs. It makes no sense for villains to have motivations that don&#039;t personally benefit them in any imaginable way. <br />
<br />
In real life or in stories that have realistic characters, villains have one of the following motivations; greed, curiosity, a lust for power, a desire for revenge, spiteful envy or a desire for dangerous fun. Is it possible to write villains who want to kill All Might or the students of UA High for realistic reasons? Of course it is, but it&#039;s generally easier to write villains who exist for the sole purpose of perpetuating a poorly conceived storyline. Made in Abyss and Kokkoku both have villains with interesting and unique motivations that actually make sense. You can check out my reviews for those two anime.<br />
<br />
I recommend watching the first seasons of both of those anime rather than watching the 3rd season of Hero Academia, unless you like Hero Academia&#039;s world building and you want to find out how the story&#039;s going to end. You can watch this shipwreck to the very end, but I&#039;m jumping ship with what&#039;s left of my sanity. <br />
<br />
Now back to my review. The only one or two villains in Hero Academia have a somewhat realistic motivations and they&#039;re just minor characters who get as little screen time as possible. The villain I liked, fights for fun and his goals occasionally conflict with the goals of the Villain Vanguard. He&#039;s like a less interesting version of Bleach&#039;s Kenpachi. This is actually the least disappointing aspect of Season 3&#039;s storyline. <br />
<br />
To get to the heart of the problem of villain motivations, we need to examine Hero Academia&#039;s most important villain: Stain. In Season 2, we were introduced to a villain called Stain. The extent to which you like Stain&#039;s character development will determine the extent to which you will enjoy watching Season 3. If you love Stain then you will love Season 3. If you hated Stain then you will hate Season 3. If you felt ambivalent about Stain&#039;s character then you will feel ambivalent about Season 3&#039;s storyline. <br />
<br />
Villain motivations is just one of the fundamental problems that plague Hero Academia&#039;s storyline, but I think the single biggest problem: is Stain&#039;s character development. First of all, Stain has no backstory in the anime nor does he have a backstory in the manga. Why exactly Stain set out to kill licensed heroes he thought were fake heroes with ill motives remains a mystery. Season 3 expects us to believe that lots of villains were inspired by Stain&#039;s actions, which makes no sense because that implies that lots of villains actually care about the heroic qualities of Japan&#039;s heroes. By definition, the word &quot;villain&quot; implies that one has a selfish and self-centered worldview. To truly be worthy of the title of &quot;villain&quot; one&#039;s priority should be one&#039;s personal well-being not someone else&#039; heroic qualities. You cannot be a &quot;villain&quot; if you selflessly want to better society by purging it of incompetent and ill intentioned heroes. If you had Stain&#039;s motivation, then you would feel deeply insulted by the idea of being called a &quot;villain&quot; and you would never associate yourself with someone called a villain. Anyone who claims to be motivated by Stain&#039;s ideology would never to call themselves a villain or even allow themselves to be within spitting distance of anyone who happens to have villainous intentions. Horikoshi, Hero Academia&#039;s creator, has never described Stain as a misunderstood vigilante and that makes the fact that he inspires individuals who openly describe themselves as villains even more confusing. <br />
<br />
Horikoshi also does a piss poor job of convincing us, the viewers, that any so called villain who believes in Stain&#039;s incoherent ideology has an emotional makeup that makes even a lick of sense. Humans can have irrational motivations, but even irrational motives make some kind of sense to those who hold such motives. Terrorists and suicidal cult members, however bizarre their motivations may seem to the average person; can easily articulate or demonstrate the motives behind their actions. The same cannot be said for anyone of the villains in Hero Academia. <br />
<br />
The other problems that plague Hero Academia&#039;s storyline and character development include; Deku&#039;s and other important heroes&#039; increasingly powerful plot armor, the nonsensical rules that hero students are forced to abide by for the sake of maintaining some semblance of tension or drama in the story&#039;s overall plot, and the subtle but pernicious sexism that undermines some of the series best story arcs. <br />
<br />
Since Deku mastered the One for All quirk in Season 2, he has not encountered a villain or obstacle he could not physically or emotionally overcome. Not only does this plot point suck away all the drama and tension we enjoyed at the beginning of series, it also makes the overall plot a bit too easy to follow. <br />
<br />
And any hope we had for some dramatic tension later on in the story was crushed by the fact that Hero Academia&#039;s plot armor not only protects Deku from being killed, but also prevents him from experiencing any kind of emotional suffering. Since he mastered his quirk, he has not lost a single fight to a villain. If he lost a few fights to some villains once in a while, the story would be a lot more interesting and exciting. Deku&#039;s ever growing plot armor makes the story monotonous and predictable. <br />
<br />
Now it&#039;s time to get into what might be the most controversial part of my review: Hero Academia&#039;s pervasive and pointless sexism. There are 3 main problems with the way women are portrayed in Hero Academia. The first of which is the fact that no matter how hard superheroines work, they never achieve as much as their male counterparts even when they have superior quirks. Momo is a great example of this. Her quirk is incredibly powerful and she should be the number 1 student at UA high based on her grades and her masterful control her of work. But Horikoshi never let&#039;s her unleash her true potential. There are so many so many things she do with her powers that series never even hints at. She could spawn grenades, heat seeking missiles, ultrasonic guns, tear gas and any number of incredibly useful tools from her flesh. But Horikoshi paints her as a surprisingly unremarkable superheroine with the emotional weaknesses of a stereotypical Japanese girl. <br />
<br />
Since Season 2, Momo has not come any closer to being UA&#039;s best student despite her amazing potential. Like a lot of female characters in Hero Academia, she lacks self-confidence and believes that she cannot make important life decisions without the emotional support of a man. In Season 3, Momo is relegated to the role of a mildly interesting side character and it&#039;s up to the toughest male characters to almost singlehandedly save the day. <br />
<br />
Secondly, women are consistently portrayed as being less motivated and less hard working than men for no other reason than the fact they are women. Even if we suppose that women in real-life Japan don&#039;t work as hard as men even when they are exceptionally talented, this series forces all it&#039;s female characters to never even attempt to push beyond the artificial physical and emotional limits they place upon themselves. It&#039;s fine if one female characters fits a certain gender stereotype, but a story in which all female characters suffer from the same female problems is not only less realistic, but also less fun to watch. The 1st episode of Season 3 portrays all the female characters as lazy fun lovers, but portrays men as hardworking and dedicated to their training as heroes. Someone will argue that female social pressure makes the ladies less motivated and a little more relaxed, but that makes no sense in the context of a dangerous and life-threatening school environment where students are attacked by powerful villains on a regular basis. The terrifying prospect of being killed by a villain should be enough motivation to keep any student on their toes regardless of their gender.<br />
<br />
And lastly, too many female characters seem to lack self-confidence simply because their women. There are no men in Hero Academia who lack self-confidence and that&#039;s really suspicious. Even Mineta, one of the weakest quirk holders and arguably the least motivated male character, never experiences a crisis of confidence or  a moment of doubt. He never even considers quitting UA High. In this series women are less self-confident, regardless of how powerful their quirk is, simply because they&#039;re women. There is a difference between revealing gender stereotypes and reinforcing them. Hero Academia wholeheartedly indulges in gender stereotypes that weaken the impact of the story. If any of the male heroes questioned their abilities as heroes or decision makers, the story would be more interesting and engaging. What if Deku experienced a crisis in self-confidence? Wouldn&#039;t that be fun to watch? Or are all men immune to the emotional suffering that plagues female characters? The fact that men never hesitate or falter in this series, makes Hero Academia feel like a silly power fantasy written by a man for men. <br />
<br />
Whether or not you&#039;re convinced that Hero Academia&#039;s veneer of thematic depth makes it the greatest shonen anime ever written, at some point in Season 3 you&#039;re going to feel the crushing weight of all the story problems I&#039;ve just described.

    This season was just more of the same of the previous two except longer. We first get another training arc, where the students are training to improve their quirks. The training portion amounted to “the more you use it, the stronger it gets.”, how exciting. The author must have realized how dull it was as it only lasted about half the episode and was never to be seen again for the rest of the season.  <br />
<br />
Next was another attack by the Shigaraki and goons, their goal this time is to kidnap Bakugo. We’re also introduced to a new one dimensional villain called Muscular, who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review288595">
        debuts and is defeated by a 1000000% smash asspull from Deku the same episode. I also can’t get over how stupid it is that the students need permission from their teacher to use their quirks despite being in a life or death situation (Even made more annoying is the fact that such a rule wasn’t present in the first season when Shigaraki and friends first attacked). Anyway, the League of Villains succeed for once and kidnap Bakugou. Why? Because they want to recruit him. That’s right, someone who chooses to enroll in one of the top hero school totally has his eyes set on becoming a villain apparently. Stupid shit like this is why the villains in this show can’t be taken seriously (And it doesn’t help that we still know next to nothing about them). We’re again introduced to another new, bland villain named All for One, who is the villain counterpart to All Might. The two eventually engage in their last battle and All Might wins. <br />
<br />
With the exception of the first fight between Deku vs Bakugo, the battles in this series are generally lackluster, and All Might vs All for One is no exception; there was no build-up, the fight itself was mostly talking about All Might’s mentor (Who we still don’t know enough to care about) and at most there were about 4 exchanges overall with explosions everywhere, how exciting.<br />
<br />
The final arc of this season is again, an examination. This time they’re going to take an exam in order to get their “Provisional Hero Licenses”, which allows them to use their quirks to save people and put down villains. The first portion of the exam consists of playing dodgeball, I shit you not, this is how they pick heroes who can be entrusted with saving lives and taking down villains. One Punch Man had a better examination and that was a freaking parody. Second part of the exam wasn’t so bad until Todoroki gets into an utterly stupid quarrel with a newly introduced character named Inasa, and holy shit, this guy takes pettiness to a whole other level; Inasa apparently was suppose to enroll into U.A but instead chose to literally go school in the other side of the country just because he didn’t like Todoroki, and it’s not like Todoroki did anything to him, he just didn’t like the vibe Todoroki gave of. Due to Inasa’s actions both him and Todoroki fail the exam, but wait, there’s actually another test that those who failed can take in three months to earn their licenses, consequences be damned.<br />
<br />
So again, we get more training, more Shigaraki &quot;doing stuff&quot; and more exams. Most shonen have repetitive formulas but they are at least heading towards something, MHA’s just going in circles from the looks of things, I mean, this season is almost over and we’re getting yet again, another fight between Deku &amp; Bakugo (Though if it’s anything like the first one then it’s might be worth looking forward to). The show doesn’t even have anything to make up for it’s lack of story; the world building is practically non-existent, the fights consist of either talking or spamming the same technique for majority of the battle, and most characters are incredibly shallow (Seriously, a lot of people claim the characters in the show are well developed and fleshed out but that couldn’t be further from the truth, only Deku, Bakugo &amp; Todoroki get anything worth noting). <br />
<br />
Long story short, the show gets worse each passing season with it&#039;s only redeeming quality being its animation at this point.<br />

    3rd season of Boku no Hero Academia review v4: <br />
(My English is not that good but atleast I tried)                                       <br />
<br />
 -story , main idea:<br />
The story and its meaning did&#039;nt had much thought in it. characters are training to be heroes and to defend the world from evils. evils are trying to block the &#039;heroes&#039; actions to take the control from them to achieve their goals.. It&#039;s all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280358">
        same in 3 seasons!<br />
The story improvement system always goes on : &#039;training , war with villans and regroup and the fall of the symbol of peace&#039;.main idea: study hard and fight till you win by improving yourself.  Still does&#039;nt change at 3 seasons....The anime was all clear like child shows. Theese are why Bnha is repetitive and bold. And tournament arcs are really unfair because characters&#039; who has more supportive ability of course lose to a damage dealing charcter. How can you viewers get hyped to this?!?<br />
Succeeding the main idea is not important. It&#039;s important to improve viewers view on a topic or an idea. If the show keeps going on a monotone path , the main idea and story will be less unique and effective. That won&#039;t be an improving anime , it just would be waste of producers effort and viewers time.. And this is a total waste.<br />
<br />
 -Art and animation:<br />
There was nothing that I can call beautiful because there were no detailed drawings and ambiance.<br />
Color use in this show makes it more lively because every character had different type of hair and overly colorful costumes.<br />
Animation is fine , there were no gaps or misuses. Only the abrupt movements of characters make the action more powerful but exaggerated. (bad)<br />
<br />
 -Characters:<br />
Every character has 1 point of view since the 1st season and the anime shows only one characteristics of the characters. (not Todoroki and lida) Characters are still all narrow viewed for 3 seasons. Deku wants to get stronger and save people... Purple guy wants tits... Bakugo always wants to be in the top(hero) with a true match... every character has only 1 feature and It does&#039;nt even change in 3 seasons.0 character improvement. After the boss villan attack they tried to add &#039;depth&#039; to characters by showing their rooms that they designed. (adding more meaningless variety of colors do the trick , right?) ffs-.-* And they wasted more than 3 episodes for &#039;character showcase&#039; scenes. And why tf their quirks keep appear on the top every time we see the characters like the viewers are morons? And quirk explanation for every character takes more than a minute.<br />
They created variety of TeEN ChaRaCteRs which at least one of them relates to viewers by making the viewers feel closer to the character and the anime. It made this series more popular a lot easier and made this series overrated with this use.<br />
Talking during fights and analyzing the fights lasts for too long mostly. It&#039;s scene time waste. They could use the screen time to improve characters.<br />
Fan service has always been a dissapointment in anime by lowering the characters view , characters action width and communitys&#039; quality.<br />
<br />
 -Sound and ambiance: <br />
Music makes act of characters and action scenes a lot more exaggerated. I really dislike that most of the animes have a moving music in a slow part/scene. Music should give a background effect and help creating the ambiance like Made in Abyss. Music should&#039;nt be the main effect.Music should be like dust in the wind.<br />
There are 4-5 tracks are used too much that the music makes the anime repellent. There was nearly no ambience effects to make the scenes attractive and they did&#039;nt add meaning to aesthetics. They always use the same music and effects when they show a new training place and when they fight. This makes the occurances &#039;cliche&#039; and less effective.(every monotone uses makes anything more cliche and overdone)<br />
SFX were coherent. They don&#039;t stand out much because of loud music mostly.<br />
<br />
 -&#039;comedy&#039;:<br />
Sorry, there was comedy in this series?<br />
 Ah yes because the series is a total joke.<br />
<br />
Lastly:<br />
&#039;&#039;The main idea may be superficial but It gets to its point with less flaws&#039;&#039;(no).<br />
If the fiction does&#039;nt have depth , it won&#039;t have flaws much. That makes it <br />
run of the mill. they shouldn&#039;t just train or fight the villains, there must be a psychological change, change on the hero system or world balance at least (not the fall of symbol of peace). An effective show must have improving story system and idea to create depth.<br />
This anime is&#039;nt much different than American supernatural films. It feels like they got effected by Hollywood.<br />
<br />
I had the same view from the 1st season. I guess this won&#039;t change till the end.<br />

    I dropped MHA Season 3 midway so this&#039;ll just be my review up until that point. I don&#039;t plan on picking it up again.<br />
<br />
Story: 5/10. MHA brings up very interesting questions and themes but does nothing with them. The fast pace of the story is great for entertainment value, but it also causes the show to skim over its characters and themes. Certain arcs with potential are just glossed over in just 5-7 episodes, leaving us with forgettable moments and characters. <br />
<br />
The pacing is also very inconsistent. Villain arcs are rather ok for the most part, but they&#039;re then usually followed up by a boring

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301032">
        and long training arc that doesn&#039;t even flesh out the characters well. Even after 50 episodes, most of the characters are still the same one-dimensional brats they were in season 1, even the PROTAGONIST hasn&#039;t gone through any substantial development other than crying at his insecurities and then punching things really hard. <br />
<br />
Wasted potential at its finest. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art and Sound: 9/10. Fantastic and consistent. <br />
<br />
Character: 3/10. It&#039;s amazing how people think MHA has a diverse and well-fleshed out cast; this cast is possibly one of the worst I&#039;ve seen. Characterization in MHA means giving each character 1-2 generic personality traits and calling it a day; only 2-3 characters actually have some depth to them in the form of a backstory, but other than that most of the characters are bland.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the villains are absolute jokes. There is nothing remotely interesting or original about them, all they do is sit in a bar. Even one of the most hyped up antagonists was rather underwhelming during his big moment.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:  5/10. As I watched MHA, my perspective slowly went from &quot;Oh this is awesome!&quot; to &quot;...another training arc?&quot; to &quot;...what&#039;s the point of all of this?&quot; The animation is fluid and beautiful, fights are well done and the quirk power system is better balanced than most, but at the end of the day there is little to no growth in the characters and little to no development in the themes of the story. I eventually saw MHA as nothing more than eye-candy to be binged, and even then I ended up dropping it.<br />
<br />
Overall: 5/10. Ok shounen, nothing outstanding but nothing abysmally bad. At the very least it&#039;s a fun watch, but something forgettable and overshadowed by shows that actually are ambitious in their storytelling and attempt to integrate their themes with the character development and plot progression.

     This is actually my very first review so I&#039;ll try to be proper in terms of critique.<br />
<br />
(Very Light Spoilers!!)<br />
<br />
Boku No Hero Academia is one of those animes that I actually consider as mediocre regarding on how generic it is but at the same time I hate it because of how it leaves out many things in terms of characters, plot etc. and that will be explained in this review<br />
<br />
⋆Story- 4⋆<br />
<br />
The Plot of this season was based on the Licenses that they were supposed to be receiving through training in the woods and actually applying for the exam. Compared to Season 2, it wasn&#039;t done

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294750">
        extremely well considering that the beginning arc was rushed and went straight to the actual fight within 5 episodes or so, Compared to the U.A sports carnival Arc where they took the time in order to finish it and its end was enjoyable to experience. The Forest Training Arc was somewhat rushed and was not being able to completely finish due to the events that occurred but was later finished by the training they did prior to the exam so that&#039;s a plus. The (someone) retrieval mission, to be honest, was really unnecessary considering the character was formidable enough to defend himself (This was due to the fast pacing in the beginning). Besides that everything about the season was ok but didn&#039;t really reach up to standard.<br />
<br />
⋆Art- 8⋆<br />
<br />
This part doesn&#039;t really need to be explained considering the modernised art style of the season was good but not the best of course so it gets a solid 8.<br />
<br />
⋆Sound- 7⋆<br />
<br />
Boku no Hero Academia doesn&#039;t disappoint in its osts including the Op and Ed which were good but the repetitive tracks that are being used are why it gets a 7. It would&#039;ve been best if it&#039;s sound was diversified.<br />
<br />
⋆Characters- 3⋆<br />
<br />
I know you guys would be screaming at me for saying this was probably the best part, but for me, this was the worst. An anime basing off 2-3 characters and saying that the rest of the characters are practically meme material is not what I&#039;d consider the best characters. Bakogou&#039;s development was the main focus of this season and honestly considering the character he is from the 1st and 2nd season, I was surprised that this occurred and I feel like it&#039;ll get better later on. The main issue to BNHA is the characters mostly due to the lack of development. Midoriya is practically the most annoying MC I&#039;ve ever seen because of how he&#039;s more of a crybaby towards things and that&#039;s what disappoints me a lot but the worst part is leaving out the majority of Class 1A, heck it&#039;s been 3 seasons and I don&#039;t know anything about the characters and they don&#039;t shine a lot and I got bored when they focused more on the MC&#039;s then the supports which makes this the worst anime for me in terms of its characters. It&#039;s generic, typical and boring at most points because of lack of screen time for the whole class (1B is seen a lot more and they get more attention TBH and I feel like they skipped they whole entire class for no reason.) I could go rant the whole time but I actually want to get to the end but you get the idea. Focusing on 2-3 characters doesn&#039;t justify why the whole part of character development is done well. You forgot the other characters and that&#039;s something most people tend to ignore.<br />
<br />
⋆Enjoyment- 4⋆<br />
<br />
Would I recommend watching Boku No Hero Academia, well yes and no depending on how you like your Shounen animes but this was indeed the worst Shounen I&#039;ve ever seen and I don&#039;t understand the amount of love it has besides the memes. I don&#039;t really have high hopes for the 4th Season because I feel like it&#039;ll do the same mistake and I&#039;ll still have the same perception of it but considering how the next arc is one of the bests (from most sources) it&#039;s a show to take into consideration of if you&#039;re starting to watch anime but if you&#039;re a full pledged weeb then this isn&#039;t the anime for you, it&#039;ll just bore you to death.<br />
<br />
⋆Overall- 3⋆ (Plot-wise, it&#039;s bad. The other factors doesn&#039;t contribute to the overall score)

    This is a review for overall BNHA although a little bit focus on season 3<br />
<br />
BNHA is a Shounen series where superpowers , hardwork , talent , good vs bad and society are involved , and it is inspired from western superheroes as its base design.<br />
<br />
Shounen done right, nuff said. the pacing is on point while not neglect the comedy / slice of life moment of Shounen series completely. might be a little bias , but I love Shounen but hate how Fillerto , Filler Tail destroyed it, where they could bother to create a brand new 1 cour arc and it was for nothing, not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280468">
        even character development that matter to the plot , and this is not the case with BNHA.<br />
<br />
almost every episode introduce something new , either plot advancement , new result , new progress or some slice of life moment (not that much , maybe 1 episode worth). did you hate how sasuke cry about his brother complex until the end of Naruto and doesn&#039;t even get a bit of progression? fear not. BNHA also introduce that kind of character but actually gives progression in just 3 - 4 episode.no prolonged issue that just slog the series.<br />
<br />
in Season 3 , they introduce new arc. it&#039;s your &quot;mini-faction war arc&quot; that always present in the Shounen. think like chasing sasuke arc. they introduce the villain early , and they start clashing since episode 4. most of the character has their own fight and it was packed greatly so you didn&#039;t exhaust yourself like other series that use 2 episodes to talk , 2 episodes to fight, 1 episode for flashback and 1 episode for conclusion. The Arc seems flow naturally , this happened and then the other thing happened, and they are connected briefly and within the timeline. they keep me excited for every episode because the plot keep moving as the episodes goes.<br />
<br />
In short , if you love Shounen with superpower , protagonist that tried to be better , school, friendship ,  rival , and Shounen drama but hate filler from Naruto / Fairy Tail  then this series is for you.

    This season is a great example of how a show with potential could rapidly descend to mediocrity, and this is coming from someone who enjoyed the first 2 seasons. The writing this season has been so bad, that it’s impossible for me to review it without dissecting just how bad every part of this season was, so spoiler warning. Anyone who hasn’t already seen this season, stay away from this review.<br />
<br />
We start off with a mini training arc, continuing this show’s incredibly repetitive formula of training arc – villain attack – tournament arc – villain attack – training arc – villain attack. Then we’re reminded

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318459">
        of one of the show’s weakest points, the villains, they’re just so hilariously incompetent, they always lose, and they’re painfully dumb. Shigaraki, who after his confrontation with Deku last season, the show would like you to believe he’s some sort of a criminal mastermind now, came up with such a genius plan: kidnap Bakugo and turn him into a villain. Why Bakugo specifically you might ask? Did he do his research and discover he had a history with heroes that would make him more likely to betray them? Some psychological weakness he could exploit? Nope, it’s because he saw how angry he was in the ceremony of the last tournament and thought “Hey, he hates the hero society just as much as me!!....Yes, that’s right. That’s the reason he risked his entire crew (and lost some of them) for. Remember how it was weird when Todoroki suddenly didn’t want to use fire against Bakugo in the final even though he just had that break through with Deku and used fire just 1 episode earlier? I thought it was just because Horikoshi wanted to save this cool fight for later in the story maybe, the reasoning was lame but I didn’t mind. But now I get it, Todoroki didn’t use it, so Bakugo would be upset, so Shigaraki would see it and this whole stupid arc happens now. Brilliant writing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Deku’s fight with Muscular made it certain for me that this show wasn’t as good as I thought it would be. Wasn’t this show supposed to be about how an underdog who could beat stronger opponents by outthinking them? It really came down to who shouted more passionately. “My 100% broke my arm and it had no damage on him?? Well I’ll use the same broken arm but this time with 1,000,000 %!!” And then Horikoshi corrected it in an interview saying no it’s actually just 100%, he was just joking I guess. You know your writing is bad when you have to clarify something in an interview that your own story failed to do.<br />
<br />
Then comes the peak of the season, AFO vs All Might, I was actually dumb enough to expect All Might to die in this fight. I just thought this must be it, the reason manga readers keep saying this show is amazing, the reason this season was hyped so much, and it makes sense story wise, he dies taking down AFO and passing down the torch to Deku, that would be such a great turning point for the series, an actual death that changes everything, actual consequences in this series, I mean we all know All might’s literally useless as a mentor, so what possible role would he play in the story if he’s still just around as a skeleton? But yeah that was definitely my mistake, expecting a show as safe and bland as MHA to do something so risky, I mean what would happen to the sales of All might’s figures if that happened? We can’t jeopardize that! So the fight ended up being a dull replica of the muscular fight, a punch that didn’t work in his muscular form now worked better in his skeleton form somehow, and AFO proving to be not as menacing or bad ass as we thought, but another dumb villain with no motives or interesting perspective, just like the rest of them. The dullest final boss fight I’ve ever seen. Brilliant writing.<br />
<br />
Then came my absolute favorite moment of the entire series: Deku, who is supposed to be a smart guy, after nearly 60 episodes into the show, finally discovers that instead of always using punches, he can use his legs too. The way the show treats this discovery as something epic and groundbreaking is the most unintentionally hilarious thing ever. I mean the epic OST was used, and everyone was so shocked and impressed, even Bakugo was like “I just made up this new AP shot, but Deku just kicked a rock?? Damn it, I’ve been bested again!!” This is without a doubt the most retarded power up a shounen protagonist has ever had. And btw he did actually use his legs before (he broke them twice), and after that muscular fight he specifically said he didn’t use his legs to keep moving afterwards and help the heroes, so yeah, Brilliant writing.<br />
<br />
Obligatory training arc comes, a whole bunch of new characters are introduced, another psycho girl that likes Deku for no reason (that turns out to be the same previous psycho that likes him for no reason), but my favorite one is Inasa the wind guy. He was supposed to be the best of all the students on recommendations at UA, but for some reason he didn’t join UA and we were left to wonder why for a couple of episodes until they revealed the amazing reason: Todoroki refused to shake his hand once…. This guy’s only defining characteristic in the show is that he’s so passionate, well apparently he wasn’t passionate enough about being at UA to overcome the PTSD he got from one random guy not being too nice to him. That was such a mind-blowingly dumb reason, again such brilliant writing.<br />
<br />
The final part was the Deku and Bakugo fight, that was cool to be fair, animation was great and all. Honestly though I still don’t get why Deku respects or cares about Bakugo so much, this was your school bully, he kept tormenting you and abusing you all your childhood, why the hell do you even consider him to be a friend at all? What redeeming characteristics do you see in him to keep caring for him after all this time? His desire to be the best?  Really? You’ve got really low standards in picking friends Deku, you should value yourself a bit more than that.<br />
<br />
The season ends with the introduction of a new villain, who if the show keeps sticking to its incredibly repetitive formula, is probably gonna end up being another stepping stone for Shigaraki, just like poor Stain did.<br />
<br />
<br />
All in all this season pretty much exceeded my expectations in how horrible it could get, but fortunately it’s still in the “so bad it’s actually good” area for me, I still enjoyed it enough to watch the next season, although I have zero faith in the story getting any better, so it’s probably gonna be a bumpy ride.<br />

    It&#039;s not often that I find an anime so mind numbing and poorly written that I literally can&#039;t bring myself to finish it. But it happens sometimes, and this is one of those times.<br />
<br />
My Hero Academia. It&#039;s the biggest anime around at the moment, taking Naruto&#039;s throne. Superheroes are massive right now, so it&#039;s no surprise the biggest anime of the current times is a superhero anime. With all the rage there was about this series, I started watching it a few months back with season 1. I enjoyed it! Season 1 wasn&#039;t particularly anything that I hadn&#039;t seen before, but it was exciting and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318984">
        the vibrant art style and characters were very appealing. It wasn&#039;t amazing, but I liked it. The action was good and engaging, and I rooted for Deku to succeed the whole season. It left me with a taste for more of this series. I liked the idea of a new superhero series with fresh new heroes that weren&#039;t DC or Marvel, as I&#039;d definitely grown tired of seeing Batman and Iron Man for the millionth time. I thought I really understood why this series was popular now. Oh, but per usual, I was wrong. Very wrong.<br />
<br />
Season 2. I started season 2 a little while after I&#039;d finished the first season, quite excited to see the continuation of Deku&#039;s story. <br />
<br />
And then there was a sports festival. Oh, dear God. <br />
<br />
I knew it was going to be bad the moment they started talking about a sports festival. I knew from that point, season 2 was in trouble. But I kept watching anyway. For over half the season, 12 episodes if I recall correctly, they were doing that stupid sports festival. It was so god damn boring. It didn&#039;t even make sense for superheroes to be competing in a sports festival. Aren&#039;t they meant to learn to work together, not to compete? Yet somehow, I managed to sit through that god awful crap. The sports festival amounted to nothing at all, really. All it gave us was minor character development for Todoroki. Other than that, it was mostly all filler and I still to this day don&#039;t know how I sat through it. Eventually it got back on track with the main story involving the villains, and I hesitantly finished season 2. At this point, my hopes were destroyed. Basically the entirety of season 2 was filler and meaningless crap that didn&#039;t interest me or engage me at all. But despite all that, I still thought, &quot;Now that the sports festival crap is over maybe season 3 will be good!&quot; <br />
<br />
HA HA, nope. Season 3 somehow finds a way to be even worse and even more boring, to the point where I couldn&#039;t even bring myself to finish it. And I don&#039;t want to ever finish it, because this show sucks and I don&#039;t give a flying rat&#039;s ass about it anymore.<br />
<br />
Season 3 starts with all the main cast going on a field trip somewhere. I don&#039;t remember why or for what purpose, but they go on a field trip and camp for a while and do some activities. Then the league of villains attack, and lots of violence and fighting ensue. All the action at this point felt forced and like it didn&#039;t really have any reason to happen, so I didn&#039;t think much of all the fighting. But at least it was more interesting than a sports festival I guess? <br />
<br />
The show goes on, and more battles with the villains happen. Then later on All Might has an enormous battle with the main villain or something like that. At this point my brain just doesn&#039;t care and it&#039;s barely comprehending anything that&#039;s happening. There&#039;s a lot going on, a lot of action, but my interest is at an all time low. The action is entertaining enough that I keep forcing myself to get through this slog of a show, until the show reaches a point where now All Might is worn down and can no longer retain his power, and now Deku has to find a way to take his place despite the fact he&#039;s still struggling with his own powers. Deku hasn&#039;t made any progress since season 1 at this point, and it&#039;s become very grating. After some more nonsense, Deku figures out how to use his powers more efficiently by focusing on using a kicking combat style with his legs instead of punching like All Might does, as he was copying All Might all this time, and he now has some support things that will stop his legs and arms from being harmed during combat, which was a major hurdle he had to get over throughout the series. This happens over half way into the season, and it felt very insulting that it took this long for Deku to do anything. 3 seasons and about 50+ episodes into this crap, and only now Deku is starting to figure out how to use his powers properly. The entire second season may as well not have existed with how little it did for the story. This probably sounds like a bit of a lazy recap, but people who&#039;ve seen this stupid season will know what I&#039;m talking about.<br />
<br />
It started to get a little bit interesting again, as finally SOMETHING was happening. Deku was figuring out that he has to use his own style and can&#039;t just copy All Might for everything, and it felt like some kind of progress in the plot was actually happening, for the first time in like 50 episodes of this series overall. Oh, but then guess what?<br />
<br />
BACK TO THE COMPETITIVE TOURNAMENTS! OHH YES!<br />
<br />
The show goes straight back into a competition with all the characters where now they have to throw balls at glowing points on each other&#039;s body, and they can only be hit 3 times before they&#039;re out. I let out a gigantic sigh as this began to happen, as I realized now it was time for more filler to stretch out this very simple story to stupid lengths once again. I tried. I really did. A few more episodes and it just kept feeling like a blur because I really did not care at all. I tried to finish this slog. I thought: &quot;There&#039;s only a few more episodes, just finish it.&quot; But I reached episode 18, and still nothing was happening, and I simply just couldn&#039;t take it anymore, and shut the stupid thing off. It&#039;s not often I&#039;m driven to this point where I physically and mentally can&#039;t take a show anymore because it&#039;s so grating and boring, but somehow this show broke me. I seriously couldn&#039;t take it. I stopped there, deleted it off my hard drive, and never looked back on this steaming pile.<br />
<br />
3 seasons and over 50 - 60 episodes and absolutely nothing happened. Basically no character development, no story progression except ONE thing, that ONE thing being Deku finally figuring out his own fighting style. No world building whatsoever, all we know is there&#039;s places in the city named after Star Wars planets and nothing else. Absolutely nothing. I have no idea how you even create a show this long and have absolutely nothing happen in it. All this show has going for it is some nice visuals and fancy action scenes, but they DO NOT make up for a horribly written story. I have no reason to care about any of the massive fights or action when there seems to be no real reason for any of it happening. I also have no reason to care about pretty visuals when the show has no depth and basically no freaking plot. It&#039;s empty garbage, all of it. <br />
<br />
Think about it. 50 - 60 episodes is about how long it took for a massive epic story like Fullmetal Alchemist to begin and end. That&#039;s roughly how long it took for Avatar The Last Airbender to begin and end. And yet, in that amount of time in My Hero Academia, NOTHING happened. NOTHING AT ALL. It&#039;s pathetic.<br />
<br />
Overall, this is more of a review of the entire show up to this point, more than it is a review of season 3 specifically, but I wanted to get this stuff off my chest. I hate this show with a passion simply because of how much of my time it wasted. I wish I had just given it up after season 2, but my stubborn wishful thinking always drives me back until I reach this point where I can&#039;t take it anymore.<br />
<br />
God help you people who decide to watch season 4 when it comes out. I have no idea how you guys even sat through all of this so far. God freaking help you.

    While the show has some some potentially good things, these are not part of the story. The show is generic to the bones, the actual plot is a straight copy of any superhero/superpower show, but for some reason, for people this show is the pioneer of that subject. Almost every quirk is boring, and the actual interesting characters have them. The show started great on season 1, with good guide and direction. The soundtrack was amazing, and the animation was ok. But everything went down from that point, season 2 and season 3 came out and the good animation went somewhere else, they had a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285269">
        lot of mistakes during scenes and apparently giving hype to a static scene is a good thing (It is to be honest, but in this case, it is a bit too much). Apparently starting with heavy fanservice was a good move. At least they kept the good sound engineering. The whole plot keeps being all over the place, with the introduction of characters that probably won&#039;t ever appear. <br />
<br />
For some reason, in this show, prioritizing bad fights with the main characters is a good thing, because the most interesting fights and characters barely get any screen time (And they are few)<br />
The character development is confusing aswell. Everyone seems to be progressing a lot with their quirks and personalities, but Midoriya doesn&#039;t seem to be doing so well, while he has a strong will and all that kind of stuff, he barely gets any development and his actual story is nowhere. They focuse too much on Bakugo/Todoroki, leaving behind a potentially excelent main character. <br />
<br />
The art is good for the most part, but like i said, the animation is really dull. The direction is going, it&#039;s just like any other shounen out there. The character design feels empty, with only a few characters being interesting enough to talk about.<br />
<br />
The opening/ending combo has always been my favorite part, season 2 to be honest my favorites (Both arcs), this season though, the music just feels... there? It&#039;s like its just there but it doesn&#039;t stand out from the other 3 openings/eds. The background music is also a strong point, building hype for each scene. Same could be said about voice acting, and sound engineering in general, its all in the right place, with fantastical voice acting.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t say i enjoyed this, hence why i dropped it. Season 2 was horrible and this started with the left foot. Not my thing, please refrain from calling me a troll, if you are gonna report me, do it for something valid and not your &quot;you didn&#039;t like it, therefore i don&#039;t like you&quot;.

    &quot;My Hero Academia’s third season is quite an outstanding product.&quot;<br />
Before I finished this third season, and I had only watched the first twelve episodes, that is how my first review began. The season&#039;s first twelve episodes are probably the best in the series up until this point. The Forest Training Camp and Bakugou Arcs that these first twelve episodes adapt bring out the best of the main characters and setting in stone a new fate for the future of the anime.<br />
Unfortunately, I picked up the anime and manga series almost a year and a half later, watching the next thirteen episodes, and witnessed the true

          <span style="display: none;" id="review322929">
        nature of My Hero Academia.<br />
<br />
First off, I would like to say that Bones offers great animation and sound for the My Hero Academia anime. But there is no fixing the problems I experience with this series that come straight from the manga.<br />
Most of our characters, after 60+ episodes, have almost no development. I&#039;ve come to conclude that outside of Deku, Bakugou, Todoroki, and MAYBE Uraraka and Kirishima, all of Class 1-A are background characters that exist solely for pleasing fans. When they appear on screen, they are there simply for &quot;funny anime moments&quot; and for the sake of screentime. They don&#039;t actually get development that matters in the grand scheme of things. For the most part, they are not needed in any important situation, and the series could easily do without them existing at this point. I notice that the series has a habit of introducing new characters and making them SUPER important, but doing frickall with Class 1-A. If they&#039;re going to have screen time, at least give them proper exposition and development.<br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s the entire Hero License Arc from episodes 14-25 of this third season. It honestly feels like an arc that exists solely for hype, just so we can see the characters fight. The entire arc&#039;s theme is really tired out, in every season since the first we seem to have an arc where Class 1-A trains and/or fights in &quot;unique terrain&quot; that includes generic city and rocky formations. Compared to the first two arcs in the season, the arc feels dragged out. Though this is more of a personal thing, it could have carried on faster. The fillers added throughout the arc add virtually nothing, including a fight with an anime-original &quot;all-girls high school&quot;. And here we go introducing new &quot;competitor schools&quot;, building tension without release, because they do absolutely nothing within the arc and the only ones that even slightly matter are two characters from Shiketsu High. At this point, I feel like the story is introducing too much characters to know what to do with. Overall the Hero License Arc was incredibly boring despite its importance of obtaining licenses.<br />
<br />
I would like to conclude that the series has a formula that goes from Deku and 1-A funny antics, training/student combat, fight the bad guy. Rinse, repeat. U-A Arc to WSJ Arc. Tournament Arc to Stain Arc. Forest Camp to Bakugou Rescue. Hero License to the next saga. It really takes out any sense of progression and makes it seem like no matter what the series will return to the status quo. While Episodes 13-25 sucked out my enjoyment, I cannot deny that the first 12 Episodes, the next season and even everything before has a crazy amount of potential for growth. I just wish My Hero Academia would give more time nurturing the things it needs to blossom.

    One of the most popular JUMP-series finally get the sequel they deserve for being super fantastic last season. <br />
<br />
Boku no Hero Academia once again bring the storm to anime-community and has proven that they&#039;re the best modern-shonen in the business. The last three episodes spoke for itself.<br />
<br />
Starting the show with a very weak start, most of the watchers have let their guard down only to be blown away by the superb-quality from the best episode so far in the series, which is fourth episode. Oh well, if you haven&#039;t catch up until the fourth episode, watch it immediately, and it will be the best thing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280378">
        you will do all day. Shoutout to the Midoriya&#039;s voice-actor and especially Bones for making one of the best fighting-scene I&#039;ve ever watched.<br />
<br />
The important thing that should be mentioned is the mediocre Class B finally move-up from their comfort-zone to working-hard and slowly becoming a Hero they&#039;ve always wanted to be. All characters have a great development equally, something that has always been missing in most of shonen-series. Almost all of the support-characters in shonen-series are usually overshadowed by the main characters, but Boku no Hero Academia change that perspective in spectacular way. The way of the story-writing feels a lot like Eiichiro Oda, a perfectionist who never wants to left a weakness in his story.<br />
<br />
It’s still at 6th-episode, but Boku no Hero Academia already broke all of people&#039;s expectation. So, it’s safe for us to always expect something greater.
