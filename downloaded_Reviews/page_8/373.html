    Acting so cute all the time that weaker men puke. Doing weird klutz stuff at least once a minute. Generating a weird, untranslatable sound effect when ever anything happens. And showing any traces of personality is automatically out of character. The life of a moeblob is certainly not the easiest, but gladly we have friends, family, school club and the will to do the things we want. <br />
<br />
This movie is practically identical to the anime series, offering new content and pushing the romance onward. Fans and haters will hold similar thoughts about this sequel for the given reason. Those who thought Tamako Love Story is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284230">
        the best conclusion KyoAni has ever given, will find Take On Me give them a gentle bitchslap in the face. <br />
<br />
Our story is amazing. The daily life of Rikka and Yuuta where we run from place to another in absolutely ridiculous tempo. The movie is practically a presentation of what side-tracking means. Much like the mind of a child, the focus changes from one play to another. Our characters constantly getting interested from new things and interacting with the newly discovered, only to find something better moments later. This type of ADHD narrative holds some beauty for sure. <br />
<br />
My favorite scene was the one where Rikka was supposed to study, but wore night goggles and ate cookies instead. If this is not how you life properly then I don&#039;t know what is. My favorite meme was Rikka failing to enter Mordor. As a person who also has found automatic doors to be my enemies, I can totally identify. My favorite explanation was Rikka&#039;s take on motion sickness. It&#039;s the devil! <br />
<br />
There are 4 core flaws here that all made me drop my score by one:<br />
<br />
- No date at a zoo arc<br />
- No one drinks dr. Peter <br />
- Deko&#039;s hair rolls didn&#039;t K.O anyone<br />
- They didn&#039;t use the song &#039;Take On Me&#039; by a-ha even once<br />
- When Rikka brought destruction upon earth, there were no casualties<br />
- The movie contained direct to indirect kisses in 5:1 ratio which is way too low<br />
- The amount of Yuuta and Rikka holding hands totaled mere 16 minutes. What travesty.<br />
<br />
I started from 11 because this thing is beyond perfect by default, and I refuse to count because math is for nerds.<br />
<br />
I recommend this movie to intellectual people as there was a symbolic artwork in the background, The Creation of Adam. There were also countless eggies from earlier KyoAni shows, such as the stuffed animal being a character (Talking Pimp-Bird-san) from Tamako Market. I have decided to release my review with a score of a 10/10 to prove that I, indeed, understood these references. <br />
<br />
Those who don&#039;t think this review is amazing most likely didn&#039;t yet see the movie, or my references failed. Either way, this movie is beyond happy and I especially recommend this to people who aren&#039;t because you will be after watching it.

    This is the cinematic version of a &quot;F*ck you&quot; <br />
<br />
The movie is a big, pretty piece of f*cking nothing. Nothing happens in the grand scheme of the Chuunibyou series. There are no themes here that aren&#039;t tackled somewhere else in this series, but the worst part of it is it dangles genuine character growth in front of you and then it spits on it and sneers at you, &quot;How could you? How could you genuinely expect these characters to develop and change and grow? Don&#039;t you know you need to accept all the imperfections and bla bla bla&quot;<br />
<br />
Rikka&#039;s character arc in this movie is utterly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285235">
        ruined, because it would rather pander to it&#039;s base and keep everyone&#039;s precious status quo than possibly challenge the viewer. These characters are stuck undergoing their Sisyphean task of being the same dull characters they were in the rest of the series. <br />
<br />
The idea of Rikka finally maturing and dealing with the adult world in a healthy way is a very interesting one, but the execution is atrocious instead choosing to romanticize her unhealthy delusions because &quot;As long as someone encourages you delusions- I mean loves you for you are, you need not grow&quot; She has grown past the need for these eight-grade delusions, but because the audience hasn&#039;t, she will be perpetually stuck as a mentally ill teenager.

    Love, Chunibyo &amp; Other Delusions! Take On Me is what the TV anime&#039;s second season should have been. The film finally brings closure to Yuta and Rikka&#039;s stagnant relationship while reinforcing the core themes of the series. Unfortunately, this also means that, despite having an all-new story, this film essentially rehashes the same conflict from the second season, only with better writing. The fact that we&#039;ve seen these story beats before diminishes their impact, no matter how well they stand alone.<br />
<br />
Take On Me begins with Rikka up to her usual antics. She&#039;s in her third year of high school now, but not only does she

          <span style="display: none;" id="review271038">
        still have chunibyo, she and Yuta still haven&#039;t even kissed. This alone strains credibility, but fortunately the film immediately identifies this as a problem to be fixed. Rikka and Yuta go on a journey around Japan together, knowing that they&#039;re escaping from impending reality, but wanting to maintain their current relationship until the end. Fans who have been waiting to see progress between these two will probably come out of the film feeling satisfied.<br />
<br />
It is starting to get tiresome, however, to see this series revolve around the same “will they or won&#039;t they?” romance in its third instalment. Rikka and Yuta may be an official couple, but if anything, they&#039;ve gone backwards since the first season. By this stage, Rikka has some prosaic issues that she ought to be worrying about—like whether she can pass her entrance exams—but her only moments of introspection show her worrying about whether falling more in love with Yuta will make her “lose” her powers. This is the exact same conflict that was central to the second season. This time, at least, Take On Me allows Rikka and Yuta to progress their romance, but the issues of Rikka&#039;s grades and future are never brought up past the beginning of the film. It&#039;s a sweet resolution, yes, but it&#039;s frustrating to watch these kids work through the same basic issues every time.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, it&#039;s not the destination that matters so much as the journey. As a road trip story, Take On Me encapsulates that idea perfectly. Fans of Kyoto Animation shows will get an extra kick out this film, as the characters visit the locations shown in Tamako Market, Sound! Euphonium, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Clannad, and other familiar series. Not only do these various locations provide fodder for some amusing sight gags and referential humor, it also gives the characters a chance to breathe outside the school setting. The gags feel fresh here; it&#039;s especially funny to see Nibutani and Dekomori take on the role of the ineffectual pursuers. Their hilarious frenemy dynamic definitely steals the show more than once.<br />
<br />
I should note that not every character gets a chance to shine in this film. Kumin-senpai has apparently graduated but still hangs around the school anyway, but this setup is a bit of a waste since she barely contributes to the plot in any meaningful way. Shichimiya, meanwhile, is stuck playing the same role she had in the second season—the friendly antagonist who pushes Rikka to make an important choice. To be fair, the series has always had a problem with utilizing all of its characters effectively, but I do wish Kumin and Shichimiya could have more chances to show off their quirks in this film.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s also a bit disappointing that the production values aren&#039;t quite as polished as they could be. The film by no means looks bad—this is a Kyoto Animation production we&#039;re talking about—but there were some noticeable imperfections with the compositing in particular. 3D objects like vehicles stood out against the 2D backgrounds more than they usually do for a Kyoto Animation production. I also couldn&#039;t help but notice that the crowd scenes didn&#039;t have as many background characters drawn in them as usual. The animation itself was on par with the TV anime series, which is to say it was full of energy and stylistic flourishes, but for a cinematic feature, Take On Me was a bit of a letdown.  <br />
<br />
In short, Take On Me is the quintessential Chunibyo experience: it captures the charms of the TV series but also the flaws. On a thematic level, the series has already said everything it needed to say in the first season; everything since has been an extended encore. The film functions best as fanservice, not just for Chunibyo fans, but for anyone who has ever loved a Kyoto Animation production. Take On Me is at its most fun when its jokes veer off the plot&#039;s beaten track to revel in the countless Easter eggs aimed at KyoAni fans. I won&#039;t spoil these, as spotting them for yourself is half the fun, but after watching the film I&#039;ve started to think that maybe the world is ready for a Kyoto Animation extended universe saga.<br />
<br />
Overall, I recommend Take On Me only for Kyoto Animation fans who weren&#039;t too jaded by the second season of the Chunibyo TV series. Actually, you can probably understand the film without watching the second season. Only Shichimiya was a new development in that season, and her role is pretty much the same in the film anyway. Also, do watch this film if you&#039;re a fan of the shipping, as it absolutely does deliver by the end. Otherwise, my general recommendation for Chunibyo is to stick to the first season of the TV series—it&#039;s the best telling of the same story.

    I have to admit that I first started watching  Chunibyo  because of two main reasons: the pretty visuals, and the presence of eyepatch (girl) . But once I began watching the show in earnest, I found a lot more here than I expected.  Chunibyo is a show that keeps me guessing, and consistently tugs at strings I didn&#039;t know existed until they were pulled.  <br />
A sense of nostalgia was the first reaction I had, and what most people would. A past of imagination and fun. We laughed, cried, even danced for things that bring us joy. Being a high school student,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review270587">
        we move on, banishing our past. Some say that our past allows us to move on and run away from it. Perhaps from fear? Embarrassment? Concern? Maybe Maturity. But, we can never run away as it is always a part of us, it makes us a special, unique individual.<br />
<br />
That is how Chuunibyou in my opinion is portrayed. As a reflection on our past and how it shaped our future. <br />
<br />
Chuunibyou is translated as “Eighth-Grade Syndrome.” An epidemic for people in the eight grade. A certain website states that it is a slang term depicting three different cases: The antisocial types, ones with the &#039;cool&#039; factor, and ones who admire mystical powers and recreates them in reality through their imagination.<br />
<br />
Story and Characters: (9)<br />
<br />
Chuunibyou&#039;s main characters include: Togashi Yuuta, Takanashi Rikka, Nibutani Shinka, Dekomori Sanae, Tsuyuri Kumin and Isshiki Makoto (Uhh... Is he a main?)<br />
<br />
Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! depicts a newly enrolled high school student, Togashi Yuuta. A teenager whose past is what he thinks as banished from his mind, a few head bangs on his wall is an example. He enters high school with a clean slate, so he says. &quot;Dark Flame Master&quot; his faked ulterior personality due to having a different mindset of his friends. <br />
<br />
Takanashi Rikka. A person with a rather serious case of Chuunibyou. And is expressed by rather peculiar movements and stances that the responders cannot help but laugh. But in future episodes she experiences development of mind, heart and soul. <br />
<br />
Nibutani Shinka, the classmate of the two above and Isshiki, relates to Yuuta in the way of wanting to forget about her chuunibyou past. She is also the motherly type I suppose and expresses this love towards other characters giving her a rather lovable personality and character. <br />
<br />
Dekomori... Smart... but just weird. Not saying she&#039;s a bad character but was one of the most strongest, bringing powerful scenes towards the end. But either way, she too has Chuunibyou, with twin tails which are... heavy. Yeah that would hurt, right Nibutani?<br />
<br />
Isshiki, doesn&#039;t play much of a role but plays a good comedic role like a side character (referring to Clannad and Little Busters if you know what I&#039;m talking about)<br />
<br />
Kumin-senpai is an admirer of people with Chuunibyou. A rather peculiar, sleepy case who in turn plays a huge role towards the end. <br />
<br />
Art: (10)<br />
Kyoto Animation presents stunning quality in their animation. Well I&#039;m no expert but it was truly outstanding as always. <br />
<br />
Sound: (9)<br />
Atmospheric background music is best for bringing out character development and emotions towards the viewers. Kyoani successfully manipulated music to their advantage and used that initiative to have an awesome soundtrack.The timing of the music is what I&#039;m speaking of. The dramatic music played at the right times, the foreshadowing, comedic etc. allows people to be drawn into the same environment of chuu2. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: (10)<br />
Everything from Chuunibyou was enjoyable. The comedy and romance both created and anime for everyone joy, happiness and some sad scenes had drawn my attention from the beginning. Chuu2 has this element that would make the haters of moe, romantic-comedic genres become entranced into this show. That element is for you, the viewers to find out. <br />
<br />
And of course Overall (10). As MAL states it was just Outstanding. Everything about it is lovable. I&#039;m out of words at the moment so I cannot explain how great this anime is. Viewers looking for a balanced romantic comedy with some drama, this is for you. <br />
<br />
This is my first review. I had fun typing up this and being the first for this anime brings me great pleasure to do so. Please if it doesn&#039;t trouble you say if this was helpful or not, I&#039;d like to continue reviewing if people like reading it. And please mind my English, never was good at it hehe. Thanks for reading and hope I didn&#039;t waste your time XD<br />
<br />
EDIT: I appreciate the criticism people expressed to me. Granted some (one) of them were not constructive but I really do appreciate what people said to me. Thanks for the comments :)<br />
<br />
And finally: Reality be rent. Synapse break. Banishment, this WORLD!!

    A lot of good ratings for a decent at best movie. I don&#039;t have the pretence to fancy myself putting together a wanna-be deep analysis, so let&#039;s keep this short and to the point. <br />
<br />
This movie is okay. Unless your standards are pretty high or you&#039;ve only got so much time to spare, this movie is pretty harmless. It&#039;s not offendedly bad, but calling it good would be a stretch. Just be sure to keep your expectations in check. <br />
<br />
Chuunibyo was never a stellar show, its second season is allegedly crap. This movie had the foundation story-wise to transcend the overpopulated realm of the barely

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284835">
        decent that its franchise has settled in, but unfortunately, it does not deliver. It had me smirking a couple of time, but that&#039;s about it. Nothing happens in a good chunk of the movie, but that shouldn&#039;t be a problem if you like the characters. Rikka is cute when she&#039;s not utterly retarded and the duo Dekomori-Shika is fun to follow. However, the visuals are really sub-bar for Kyoani, really feels like they put minimum effort. <br />
<br />
Now if you&#039;re familiar with this show, you know how reluctant it is to develop the relationship between MC-kun and Rikka. SPOILER AHEAD. While the movie serves as some kind of conclusion, it feels more like a half-assed attempt to bring closure than a real  study of the themes of the show and the characters. It&#039;s a shame really because the movie could have tackled serious questions such as &quot; Should you/ Can you keep loving someone even when they stop being who they were ?&quot;, &quot; How do you handle the fear of change in your life ?&quot;, &quot;Can you really look after someone forever while expecting them to change and get better ?&quot; ... Instead, the movie has its characters kiss twice before relapsing in their chuuni cringe-fest and calling it quits. The message, if there is such a thing, is confusing. If, by any chance, I got what they were going for right, then I&#039;m afraid it&#039;s puerile and completely out of touch with reality. <br />
<br />
Tl;dr : It&#039;s an okay movie, funny at times, decent at best. Watch it if you like the series, otherwise there&#039;s better stuff out there for you.

    The perfect conclusion to a good anime series.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t expect much of this except for a good animation, but when this was out, all my thoughts were wrong. This wasn&#039;t a bad movie, this didn&#039;t include bad character development, and I didn&#039;t certainly expect them to make a good movie out of this.<br />
<br />
This movie is about Rikka and Yuuta eloping, this was a pretty good watch, although the dialogues were funny and unintentionally unrealistic, they meant pretty deep words about love--<br />
to change, or not?<br />
<br />
If you are in love, you will change. Therefore you shouldn&#039;t love if you don&#039;t want to change.<br />
<br />
However, this movie puts that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284975">
        all away, making the answer a &#039;maybe&#039;.<br />
<br />
The characters&#039; relationship was a nice touch, Dekomori and Fake Mori Summer getting along as usual, making the perfect comedy duo, and then Rikka and Yuuta, their bond is put on the test on this trip of ups and downs.<br />
<br />
The use of their soundtrack is good, using the right music at the right places, and the old opening of Chuunibyou.<br />
<br />
The animation, was perfect, as expected of KyoAni.<br />
<br />
One thing I really want to say, that this anime<br />
HAD THE PERFECT ENDING to this series.<br />
<br />
Thank you, author, for this wonderful movie.<br />
And I will miss this series.

    “Moe is when your heart gets a boner.”<br />
 -Urban Dictionary<br />
<br />
As the reigning king of all that is cute and moe, it is no exaggeration that everything KyoAni touches turns into some of the fluffiest things in anime existence. Chuunibyou Demo Koi ga Shitai: Take On Me is no exception. As the latest entry into the Chuunibyou continuity, it can be considered as the 3rd season of the series, and might also be its ultimate conclusion.<br />
<br />
Assuming that you’ve watched the previous seasons of Chuunibyou, this movie is basically just a continuation of the series. Fast forward a few months from the 2nd season, and it’s Rikka

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284892">
        living with Yuuta under one roof, doing their usual hijinks and having fun. That’s until Rikka’s sister, Toka, decided that she’ll be taking Rikka to Italy for some reason. So Rikka and Yuuta did what any sane(?) couple would do: elope and go a nationwide roadtrip around Japan. Hilarity ensues. <br />
<br />
I can’t tell you much about the plot more than that, but what I can tell is that man, this anime is cute as fuck. KyoAni basically took that same charm and everything that made Chuunibyou’s 1st season good, and distilled that essence to perfection. Whereas the first season was about creating that relationship between the main couple, this movie is all about Yuuta and Rikka actually being a couple and doing couple things.<br />
<br />
The movie delves deeper into the relationship of the two, showing us the thoughts that these characters have for one another, and fleshing out the chemistry that exists between them. It’s hilarious to see Yuuta’s thoughts and delusions go into more realistic and relatable territories of wanting to take the next step into their relationship, and showing that he wants to have those “moments” with Rikka as much as we want it to happen as the viewers. On the other side, it’s also entertaining to see Rikka act like her typical chuunibyou self, and the stark contrast of it to when she reacts to any romantic actions that Yuuta takes.<br />
<br />
The comedy aspect of the movie is also on point. If you liked the comedy of the previous seasons, then I can assure you that the movie is in no shortage of the same type of gags. It’s the same kind of comedy with Yuuta acting as the Tsukkomi to Rikka’s Boke act, and they pull it off really well. I’ve had some really good laughs with some of the jokes in the movie, especially the ones where Yuuta tries his damn hardest to not lewd Rikka in his head. It feels organic, natural, and it’s definitely something that’s relatable. As for the side cast, they’re still the same funny people from the previous seasons. The interactions between Dekomori and Nibutani are still the same, with them fighting and trying to one-up each other in every turn, and failing in the funniest of manners.<br />
<br />
Also, with all of KyoAni’s works, one has to mention the animation. It comes as no surprise, but my god this anime gorgeous to look at. With decades of experience in the art of Moe, KyoAni has really stepped up its game and has made some of the cutest character designs that it’s ever put out on the big screen. From Rikka’s adorable dresses to Nibutani’s chic outfits, it’s easy to see how much fun the people who made these designs had. Then there are also the few chuunibyou action sequences which the series is known for. They were fantastic, proving that the things KyoAni are capable of animating is not just cute girls doing cute things, but also well-choreographed and dynamic fight scences. <br />
<br />
Fans will also delight in the fact that the movie is filled with references from KyoAni’s previous works. Things from Tamako Market, Musaigen no Phantom World, Haruhi Suzumiya, and probably other things that I missed can all be seen there, and it’s very satisfying when you recognize them. It actually makes me wonder if something like a KyoAni’s version of the MCU is possible, but that’s another topic all on its own.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With all that said though, these things aren’t the main reason that I gave this movie a score as high as 10. The main thing that draws me to this movie might actually be the most biased of reasons. Simply put, it hits home.<br />
<br />
At its core, Chuunibyou is an anime that tackles the concept of growing up. Two seasons have passed, but in the end, the main underlying theme is still the fact that people need to grow up and leave their childish tendencies behind.<br />
<br />
It’s been nearly 6 years since I first watched Chuunibyou. Back then, I was just a young teen. I spent many of my days watching anime, and vividly daydreaming about scenarios in my head whenever I wasn’t. I’d go with my friends, and together we’d hang out behind school, while roleplaying as our favorite characters. We’d throw punches, do kicks, shout names of special moves, and generally just act as if we were characters in a videogame like a bunch of idiots… And honestly, it was fun.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to today. Final year of college. Majority of my friends have already graduated. Thesis looming in the corner. The pressure to succeed is mounting.  Anime and manga are starting to lose my interest, as my focus slowly shifted to things more grounded in reality. All vestiges of my childish youth are slowly slipping away, and in its place, adult stress and responsibilities.<br />
<br />
As weird as it may be, this anime, despite its lighter theme and genre, hit me harder than other, more serious titles did. As I the movie ended, I thought to myself “Eventually, they’ll grow out of it, just like I did. It’ll happen.”, and honestly, I know that they will. However, I found myself wishing that they never do. This story is a glimpse into a perfect relationship, a perfect world where there is no rush to change and adapt.  It’s reminds me of the past, of my own youth, and how those were much better times. It’s a wonderful piece of fiction, one that resonates with me, and I loved every second of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As another person put it, Take on Me is KyoAni’s love letter to its fans. They took everything that we could’ve asked for in a sequel and actually gave us what we wanted, and more. All in all, there’s really not much that I can complain about in this movie, or rather, I have none to speak of. It’s a wonderful conclusion, and I personally think it deserves the best of praises.<br />
<br />
|| Thanks for reading! It’s been roughly 4 years since I last wrote a review (which is coincidentally, for Chuunibyou 2nd season) and I’ve honestly forgotten how fun it is to do one.

    So who hated how Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!&#039;s second season&#039;s ending was such a cop out?, well Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Movie: Take On Me utterly redeems it with all it&#039;s flaws and then some!<br />
<br />
Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Movie: Take On Me gives a us runaway eloping plotline as our main focus along with simultaneously focusing on Togashi and Rikka&#039;s growing romance in the process, along with the ride are Nibutani and Dekomori on their tails with Rikka&#039;s older sister Touka trying to get her back and to go to Italy.<br />
<br />
On on the surface level, the plot seems very basic of Rikka

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284846">
        not wanting to go to Italy and almost being forced by Touka thus causing the eloping but like the old saying goes, &quot;it&#039;s not the destination but the journey&quot; and Rikka and Togashi&#039;s eloping journey around Japan is ALL about the journey they go through.<br />
<br />
See at best the eloping journey gives us much more interaction between Rikka and Togashi as well as BOTH of their delusions given (well Togashi mainly focusing on Rikka while Rikka is her typical delusions) and simultaneously giving us a good romantic angle to go by and the growing romance given making this eloping journey not of delinquency and adolescence decisions but on looking to their futures together what with how Togashi FINALLY takes the steps to do so. Their journey also somewhat tackles Rikka&#039;s chunni syndrome and to this end since Rikka&#039;s chunni&#039;s syndrome is intrinsically linked to her personality it gives Rikka a bit of an identity crisis if she falls in love, like will she erase her identity for love or will she keep her &quot;powers&quot; of the Tyrant Eye. To this it LA extremely hates the statement of &quot;act your age&quot; but age is NOT a personality nor does it give people leverage to make people act &quot;normal&quot; because they are past a certain age range not to mention being &quot;normal&quot; means being bland and like &quot;everyone else&quot;. LA never nor LA will get that statement, LA KNOWS that the real world is one unforgiving place but to have to give your &quot;identity up&quot; just to be &quot;normal&quot; is even crueler for LA thus because of this LA can relate in some respects to Rikka&#039;s identity crisis later on in the movie. Just be yourself even if it&#039;s weird, if not your a fake and with that, Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Movie: Take On Me&#039;s tackles the subject matter of chunni syndrome as well as giving  Rikka and Togashi a third option where everyone can be happy and sure happy ending is soooo cliche and whatever but for what it&#039;s worth for Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! as a series LA WANTED Rikka and Togashi to be together, so why not a happy ending?<br />
<br />
On speaking of &quot;fake&quot;, we can&#039;t forget the other main cast and sure they are essentially the allies and villains towards Rikka and Togashi&#039;s eloping but Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Movie: Take On Me&#039;s made well use of EVERY character in the series. Dekomori and Nibutani&#039;s main scthick in this movie is of them trying to capture Rikka and Togashi as Touka blackmailed both of them with incriminating photos, their typical hijinks ensues and their yuri undertones gets shot up an eleven in the process, but to be honest their comedic skits were AMAZINGLY funny. Shichimiya finally had a purpose besides being the third wheel in the second season of Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! but is more or less Rikka&#039;s mental mentor and helper in the movie when Rikka becomes confused on the situation given not to mention we FINALLY get shown a bit on Shichimiya and Togashi that was being extremely vague in the second season about, so yeah LA was surprised and thankful for Shichimiya&#039;s inclusion in this movie as yes it makes Ren (the second season) NOT reconned but still Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Movie: Take On Me made use of Shichimiya and made for a great contrast to Rikka in the process which she was SUPPOSE to be used for and to great effect in this movie. Kumin was a more or less satellite character in this movie mainly her satelliting towards Shichimiya but nonetheless she had &quot;something to do&quot; in the later of the movie. Makoto gets a cameo and FINALLY we get to see Rikka and Touka&#039;s mother someone who was mentioned but never shown fully but we finally get to see her as well as she becomes something of a goal for Togashi and Rikka in finding her. Still nonetheless Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Movie: Take On Me&#039;s entire cast was used well as much as RIkka and Togashi&#039;s setting constantly changed in the process and not everyone being in the same place.<br />
<br />
The animation done once again by Kyoto Animation is at it&#039;s best, with intrinsic detail to it&#039;s character designs along with it&#039;s beautiful background work, seriously it&#039;s what LA expected from a Kyoto Ani movie what&#039;s better is how expressive they made their characters even more. So same praise with most Kyoto Ani&#039;s work?...yup YUP.<br />
<br />
The voice acting was great with the rather exotic cast we already have but MAJOR PROPS to Maaya Uchida as the chunni Rikka and easily gets LA&#039;s MVP alongside Jun Fukuyama as Maaya Uchida&#039;s foil and straight man antics quips. Chinatasu Akasaki and Sumire Uesaka did great as Nibutani and Dekomori and this was quite obvious from both anime seasons but they had GREAT chemistry together with Chinatsu being the straight man to Sumire&#039;s chunni quips and teasing, see why LA loved their manzai antics in this movie, it&#039;s their delivery all the way. Voice acting was expectedly great what with all the voice cast reprised from the anime.<br />
<br />
So was there ANYTHING LA hated about this movie as much praise LA had been giving this movie?, well no LA can&#039;t as this movie utterly broke and went beyond LA&#039;s expectations for this essential sequel to the Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! series, character development mostly romance FINALLY went that one step beyond and worked on Rikka&#039;s dilemma of her chunni syndrome, gave Togashi a push on the romance department, comedy was spot on with the other cast members as well as Rikka and Togashi adding to it with their interactions, animation was expectedly great coming from Kyoto Ani, voice cast was great as always and the movie moved and shifted the paradigm of the series as whole and the movie had a nice blend of both comedy and &quot;serious&quot; introspectiveness when it was needed to and Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Movie: Take On Me really did execute well with Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!&#039;s typical personality which it kept intact even in the more serious moments.<br />
<br />
Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Movie: Take On Me utterly blew LA&#039;s expectations and beyond that what else was there to say? Massive character and romance development, comedic skits were executed perfectly and add in themes of growing up or in this case &quot;why do we NEED to grow up?&quot; and throwing identity for being normal and we have not only a nice ending for the Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! series but a thoughtful, crazily funny eloping romance journey with our resident chunni Rikka.<br />
<br />
What&#039;s up with Kyoto Ani anime movies redeeming and almost forgiving the sins of the father anime series, because keep doing whatever your doing because it&#039;s working!, from Kyoukai no Kanata to Tamako Market and now Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!...just LA?

    (Possible Spoilers)<br />
<br />
Reality be Rent. Synapse Break. Banishment, this world !!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The phrase that has left us behind this series, the flagship of the diffusion between the real and the fantasy, that which possess the Chuunibyou and have passed long ago. This series has been a benchmark in what to represent a group refers, their problems, their situations and where it is born, and now with this film, we enter a new stage in the life of Rikka and her group, what will bring us back?<br />
<br />
<br />
Fantastic Reality<br />
<br />
<br />
The brand of the house of Chuu 2 Koi (Abbreviation made by fans) is its ability to present you the expectations

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296430">
        of fantasy before a situation and then contrast it with reality, often ending with a funny situation, something with which Kyoto Animation had tried with &quot;Hyouka&quot; and &quot;Lucky Star&quot;, but while Hyouka did it with the purpose of transmitting a feeling beyond the real thing using its medium to represent something magical, Chuunibyou used it to make crazy scenes full of colors and energy to then show us what was really happening and make us laugh. This movie opens in exactly that way, showing us some warm colors, a beautiful sunset that collides with the halls of the school, its corridors, and its students, and then go down to earth and show us that it was just a normal summer day in extra classes.<br />
<br />
And this is not something that is only left for a moment, during the whole movie we compare expectations with the real thing, to a greater or lesser extent, and it leaves us with funny and beautiful moments as well as some impressive battles that make me ask &quot;WHY KYOANI DOES NOT MAKE AN ANIME OF FIGHTERS?&quot; Moreover, even the plot itself is something that in a real situation someone would not think twice, and this film revolves around the idea that Yuuta and Rikka escape for a while until Touka agrees to let Rikka stay in Japan.<br />
<br />
So, it leave us a premise as hilarious as the two best friends of Rikka and Yuuta, Nibutani and Dekomori, who originally devised the escape plan and thought to cover them up, end up chasing the two lovebirds all over the country to bring them back, threatened by Rikka&#039;s sister to upload photos &quot;yuri&quot; between them two (all taken out of context)<br />
<br />
But the moments in which reality overcomes the imaginary is not reduced to just funny scenes, there are moments to rest, to take a break from all the transitions and that work to show us new facets of its characters, like when Rikka talks about her mother with Yuuta, and her reaction is worthy of someone with problems relating to people in a deeper way, away from the subject and thinking for herself, it is not something that she is comfortable talking. In this same scene, Yuuta decides that he wants to talk to Rikka&#039;s mother about the future and that more distanced side of her daughter. New objectives are established that will give rise to the final outcome of their relationship.<br />
<br />
Another similar scene, in which that Rikka is taught, is where Yuuta tries to caress her while they are staying in a hotel, but she hides in her sheets because of shame, or because of fear of the moment itself. I think that these explorations in the way that someone behaves with an alienation to what is considered &quot;normal&quot; by society and that lives in their own imaginary world is an interesting concept, more when there is an interpersonal relationship in between, and that this type of reactions hinder their communication.<br />
<br />
In General, Chuunibyou Take On Me is a movie, that for many fantastic moments, continues with the feet in the earth to show human facets in its characters, and uses those magical elements as complement and a way to transmit emotions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Magic Animation<br />
<br />
<br />
And it is that that magical sensation of which I speak could not be expressed in a better way than with the visual medium such as animation. Throughout the story there have been many artistic media that tried to go beyond the concrete and enter a more oniric medium.<br />
<br />
Relax, I do not say that this work is avant-garde or experimental, but it does play a lot with the colors, styles and ways of animating that you really feel that differentiation, I say, you just have to compare the parts in which Yuuta is talking to God with, for example, when he himself imagines the future with a Rikka still affected by the Chuunibyou, the change of animators from scene to scene is noticed, and more than being an error, I see it as a way of emphasizing the different sensations.<br />
<br />
Being a little more technical, you will notice that blur that there is in the extremes, they are used to denote that what we are seeing is not something real, if not that is something within the world of the ideas of our characters. Or for example the change of the use of colors, being that in the first there is no pinch of this, to emphasize hardness and &quot;realism&quot; (within the barriers of the anime) in the stroke and drawing, while the second has a palette mainly cake, friendly and cheerful and a much smoother and rounder stroke.<br />
<br />
In this aspect it reminds me a lot of the first season of Monogatari series, which used the changes of styles and constant colors to represent different emotions and feelings, but while Bakemonogatari was much more abrupt and had no hairs on the tongue to make a direct metamorphosis, in Chuunibyou it is more subtle and digestible, friendly and that helps to settle us in the moment, all a success in this sense.<br />
<br />
Another point to highlight are the battles, Yes, I&#039;ve talked a lot about the fights, and I think there are a few anime where I could explain myself in things that I have not yet said, and this is one of those cases.<br />
If we put on two different screens a battle of the 1st or 2nd season, and one which it occurs in the film, you can see a lot of the quality change.<br />
<br />
And is that in this movie is something not very seen in most animes, where despite the use of a large weapon, the protagonist seems to brandish it quickly and agile. And the importance of weight is crucial when it comes to making something &quot;real&quot; or within the limits of our world, Chuunibyou, like Hai to Gensou no Grimgar, uses the weight of weapons in favor of giving a combat experience more kinesthetic and realistic, which more than seem clumsy or boring, it takes advantage to make much more effective the blows that are given.<br />
<br />
And you just have to take a look at their movement, the way they need to apply a great force to move pieces of weapons and the way in which they collide against the shields, making the ground tremble with the impact, as they deform their surroundings with only their movement, however fantasy it may be, it certainly tries to make it look more sensible in size-strength relation, something that should be implemented more for a better feeling.<br />
<br />
<br />
Inside Identity<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, the work honors a theme that should touch in greater depth. The identity.<br />
Identity can be said to be the set of characteristics and traits of a person, that which represents us on the outside, similar to the essence, but much more rooted in changes through time.<br />
<br />
From the middle to the front, the film shows us a much more human side of Rikka, specifically that side that is afraid to leave behind her life of fun and fantasy possessing the chuunibyou and her &quot;demonic eye&quot;.<br />
<br />
We have rarely seen that Rikka, so real and insecure, and that she is hesitant to choose Yuuta&#039;s love or to continue with her childishness.<br />
<br />
What makes Rikka &quot;Rikka&quot; was what we all know, her safety, egocentrism and exaggeration, yet fun and always rise to the clouds, but when we ask &quot;What is Rikka beyond these aspects? &quot; we can go to an unknown valley, few really know about her, her story only gives us a hunch, but as it truly is, outside the mask of that patch she is wearing, is something that never explored.<br />
<br />
The talk she has with her mother and the one Yuuta finds out about her gives us a better idea, that by much image, something of reality in her is maintained, before one of her few loved ones.<br />
<br />
This opens Yuuta&#039;s horizons, because he realizes who the person he loves is in order to accept and support her.<br />
<br />
It is a beautiful moment of serenity and revelation that helps the conclusion that will be given, and makes it logical and understandable.<br />
<br />
In the end, I think it&#039;s all about acceptance, not so much about just accepting the stupidities of the other, but about yourself, and from that base, maturing, because that&#039;s where the whole arc of Rikka&#039;s character revolves, future.<br />
<br />
The scene in which Yuuta and Rikka run to meet each other is perfectly executed, the colors, the feeling, the animation, which chooses to take a more realistic and expressionist tints, helps that feeling of distress that is not necessarily there, they have all the time in the world, but the scene itself emphasizes this so that we feel the need to see them together, the stumbles, the sweat, all the elements put on stage so that we end up with an emotional hug, which makes it clear that, of course, they will continue together.<br />
<br />
And from realism we jump directly to fantasy again, At first I felt that this scene was too much, but then I realized that it is the perfect closure to the story, to everything that the development of the two protagonists means, their growth, as people , as a couple, the culmination of their love and the long-awaited kiss that closes the bond between the two, the ritual of union, and that meant a new step, a small one, but a step after all, towards the future, towards a new one, and the disappearance of the Chuunibyou. This is the end of a beautiful story, its climax, its outcome and its exile from this world.<br />

    I rarely comment a anime except if they&#039;re a masterpiece (One of my favorite romantic anime!!!). Some people might think nothing too special happened during this movie but personally I can see a big development between the character and their relationship. At the end I felt a bit unfortunate, I wanna see more activity between them and what happens next. I&#039;m really looking forward for the season 3 ( we still got chance to have it! since this movie came out at 2018), maybe about their university and... how their relationship will go and how they will marry and having a family?  if that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339607">
        happens lol and I hope so :))

    I&#039;m surprised its so highly rated, there&#039;s definitely high points so i can see why it&#039;d be highly appreciated, but frankly i don&#039;t think this needed to be a feature. An hour at most was good enough to run through the small (not bad but not much substantially) plot and the great visuals.<br />
Despite this acting as a proper ending and epilogue i don&#039;t actually think its a very necessary addition. Despite plot advancement i don&#039;t think the execution was good enough (although i guess just that there&#039;s any advancement at all is justification for watching it)<br />
shoving story to the end <br />
Art 8<br />
great, probably half the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284800">
        reason this was made a movie, locations for backgrounds and visuals. I mean i don&#039;t know a single thing about production but this could easily have been a 13th episode if it weren&#039;t for the run away plot. They go all out for the climax (which is pretty much the only reason I knew it was the climax because it was otherwise anticlimactic as all hell)<br />
Sound 7 <br />
Perfectly fine, appreciate ZAQ in both op and ed, a tame bgm otherwise <br />
<br />
Character 6<br />
A bit of senseless shoving in of some characters which feels a little like padding. There&#039;s only 2 really egregious decisions, with the older sister performing far too many roles and not really making sense at all, and the absolute asspull of the bald/crew cut guy (sue me, no one cares about him)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 5<br />
I mean it wasn&#039;t really bad by any means. it really didn&#039;t need to be an hour and a half tho. I laughed maybe twice. its an ending, definitely an ending and it deserves appreciation for that<br />
<br />
Story 3<br />
Now into the meat of why i just dont think this was necessary. Continuing from the decision to take their relationship at their own pace, they immediately berate Yuuta for doing so, the question of will they won&#039;t they is re-initiated (for the four millionth time). The other plot, more excuse to go through many locations to get visuals for them, is almost incredulously contrived, they decide to run away to give them some weight against the older sister, because what, she&#039;s just been a pushover these two seasons right, but rikka wants to do it, so they try it out. <br />
A major issue in story is how the older sister has magical phone tracking and voice/video/picture recordings everywhere which are used to set the plot in motion but in the end its revealed that they weren&#039;t really necessary or usable? (we aren&#039;t shown any consequences, if any)<br />
Alright fine, there&#039;s no stakes but we don&#039;t really need tension anyway, we have the will they won&#039;t they question to go on at least<br />
but was anyone really satisfied for the &gt;hour of kiss teasing? I mean i&#039;m sure we&#039;re all past the conclusion that it&#039;d happen so I was dying when they were pretending it would happen even before the hour mark (and then after all the excuses it just anti-climatically happens, yuuta just, gets over his epiphany, with almost nothing to show for why this was an issue)<br />
<br />
its just almost an insult to other anime that use movies as endings/epilogues, its been done and done well, melancholy of haruhi for example is near the same, providing an insight to the meaning of the anime and capping it off for good, but instead of really investigating the question chuunibyou danced around it a few times before deciding, yeah thats good enough, let them smooch already. Maybe i&#039;m being overly critical but cmon, we really didn&#039;t need all this

    &quot;People down there look like trash&quot; - Rikka<br />
<br />
There&#039;s nothing really great about the word &quot;Familiarity&quot;. Same, boring, insignificant, words that will be used to critique the anime. However to me, it&#039;s more of a compliment to what I think may have just made me love this series just a bit more. Let&#039;s check it out shall we?<br />
<br />
If you have seen the first two season, you&#039;ll know what I meant when I say: it&#039;s familiar. The focus of the couple&#039;s unique &quot;contract&quot;, the shenanigans their friends stir up, and the opposition they face are all too familiar. It&#039;s not bad by any means, just somewhat, predictable.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277713">
        <br />
<br />
While it may be similar on plot, it&#039;s definitely has more PLOT. Be it rikka in a nurse uniform, bikini or a maid costume, you&#039;ll definitely be entertained and possibly nosebleeding. If that&#039;s not your cup of tea, we have Yuuta&#039;s failed desperate attempts to kiss rikka in public, or Rikka acting as an imouto. If that&#039;s still not your thing, no worries, the sheer crudeness, idiocy and rivalry from Deko and Mori will suffice your humor.<br />
<br />
Take on me delivers another level of dynamics in the character department. Mori summer and Dekomori as the &quot;villians&quot; really stole the show with their humor and compatibility, while the couple are as usual fantastic at delivering frustratingly cute scenes, like a dedicated scene to just the two of them kissing, alone, at night, on a cruise ship. If there was a flaw, I would point to the lack of screen time for Kumin.<br />
<br />
Visuals are clean, crisp and detailed but inconsistent. Upclose, characters looks fantastic, but zoom out just a bit and they look like a cartoonish mess. Background design has a marker effect but just a touch bit too fake. Cinematography is dynamic, with lots of spins, wide shots and dramatic angles. I also like to comment on their efforts to showcase the icons of Japan like Tokyo tower. Audio wise, using the theme song to end the movie is wonderful. BG music are appropriately timed and suitable while BG sounds are present and spacious. Vocals are mildly sharp but you&#039;ll be fine if you crank the volume up. <br />
<br />
So now for the big question. Is it better than season 2. No. Season 2 had better character presence, more time to develop and a slightly better overall art. However, if you are like me and have already invested in the anime, the amount of dynamics this movie brings (plus fanservice) is well worth watching. The embrace of familiarity really let it just focus more on making me love more of what I already love. <br />
<br />
As for our new viewers, this serves as a showcase of what to expect for both seasons in a palatable package.<br />
<br />
And now a minute on the minutia.<br />
<br />
- Rikka is a hardcore trashtalker <br />
- Rikka, Yuuta, God: Best characters in that order <br />
- Yuuta has a little sister fetish <br />
- Imouto Rikka &gt; Rikka<br />
- How much money did they actually bring?!<br />
- Tamako market, Haruhi, and clannad references<br />
- Never been to japan? This is a great sightseeing hour <br />
- Yuuta made the right move not to buy a sword <br />
- Quite a lot of distortion for dramatic effect  <br />
- The constant focus hunting when rikka is struggling to think shows kyoani&#039;s distinct attention to detail<br />
<br />

    Take On Me is a very satisfying conclusion to the story of Chuunibyou. As a die-hard fan of this anime, I felt a little nervous going into this film. I hoped that it wouldn&#039;t end up with a disappointing ending like season 2, which seemed to put a lot of people off the show, but I was proven very wrong. It&#039;s been 4 years since season 2 came out, and honestly I was hyped out of my mind to see Chuunibyou make a return. Ultimately the movie lived up to its hype, as it was basically everything I hoped for it to be. Though we

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285217">
        may not ever see a third season of the show, this movie was more than enough to wrap everything up and give fans a satisfying conclusion.<br />
<br />
The story takes place only a few months after the end of season 2, and has Touka forcing Rikka to come with her to Italy. Yuuta and Rikka talk about this to their group of friends (Nibutani, Deko, Sophia, etc) and they tell them that they should try running away together so that Rikka doesn&#039;t have to go to Italy. So Rikka and Yuuta recklessly run, and when Touka gets word of this she sends Dekomori and Nibutani after them, blackmailing them to do so. And so begins a wild goose chase through Japan as Yuuta and Rikka travel from place to place, running away. At some point Yuuta decides he wants to speak with Rikka&#039;s mother, and so they take a plane to where she lives to go talk to her. Throughout the whole of this story we see Rikka and Yuuta&#039;s relationship progress ever so slowly, as it has through most of the series, and we see Nibutani and Dekomori fight and argue like they always do. It&#039;s somewhat comforting to see my favorite characters return after many years, and yes, if you are wondering, we do indeed finally get to see Rikka and Yuuta kiss. That&#039;s something that us fans have waited so long to see, and we finally get it. It&#039;s eventually revealed that all of this was a very elaborate plan by Touka to have Rikka, Yuuta and the rest of the gang come to her wedding in Italy, and to give Rikka keys to her new home, which was a surprise. We get a happy ending with closure. Closure as we see Rikka and Yuuta FINALLY kiss and become more comfortable with eachother, as well as being able to live together in peace, and closure on the rest of the characters. <br />
<br />
As for everything else, soundtrack and sound is great, the visuals are more beautiful than the show already was, seeing as it has a bigger budget because it&#039;s a movie, and the story is satisfying as we finally see our favorite characters get some closure. If there&#039;s any complaints I have, it&#039;s simply that the movie isn&#039;t long enough. Its pacing might also seem a bit too quick to some, but this is mostly to blame because it&#039;s a movie and not a whole season. I&#039;m not sure if you can even say that&#039;s a flaw, seeing as it wrapped up everything it wanted to do perfectly in its given time. It&#039;s a bittersweet feeling after you finish watching it, you feel really happy that the movie didn&#039;t disappoint and you got some closure to the story, but then you feel kind of sad and depressed because you realise Chuunibyou is finally over. Maybe it&#039;s not though, we could always see another season, maybe another movie. But not for a long time at least. <br />
<br />
Thank you for reading this review. I&#039;m really happy this movie was good and if you&#039;re the type of person that felt disappointed by the ending of season 2, then it&#039;s absolutely essential that you watch this film. It will make you feel a lot better and put you at ease. I love Chuunibyou, it&#039;s an anime that means a lot to me and this movie is the cherry on top of it all. Thank you, KyoAni. Thank you so much.

1. What I think of S1<br />
2. What I think of S2<br />
3. The flaw of The Movie [as the sequel of S1&amp;S2]<br />
<br />
Things I need to elaborate in advance:<br />
1. MAL Rating: My ratings on MAL merely reflects the degree of my affection or aversion towards the Anime. It has nothing to do with quality of the Anime.<br />
2. Why is there Kanji in my review? It is easier for me to identify certain part and it&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314470">
        more natural. Besides, I&#039;m too lazy to remove them when I finish the review.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I think of S1:<br />
<br />
The main plot of S1 is how heroine 小鳥遊六花(Rikka) deals with the loss of her father with protagonist 富樫勇太(yuuta).<br />
<br />
Her family not only don&#039;t have patience and empathy to assist 小鳥遊六花(Rikka) in coping with the loss but also refuse to accept her identity as 邪王真眼(Jaoushingan, True Eye of the Evil King). Their attitudes towards her seem to treat her like a freak, a problem child. All they want is that 六花(Rikka) obediently behave the way the expect, comply with their will regardless of her feeling. Especially Rikka&#039;s elder sister 小鳥遊十花(Touka), 十花(Touka) let 六花(Rikka) quit school, move away from the apartment, part 六花(Rikka) from 勇太(yuuta) whilst she knows their love relationship. It seems that 十花(Touka) doesn&#039;t even ask 六花(Rikka) whether she want to be with 勇太(yuuta) from the fact that she doesn&#039;t inform 勇太(yuuta) about 六花(Rikka)&#039;s departure. Either 十花(Touka) doesn&#039;t care about 六花(Rikka) downright or this character doesn&#039;t have personality, simply a errand character. In fact, The characters in Chuunibyou Series are utterly flat and they all serve as errand character except the heroine, protagonist and 勇太(yuuta)&#039;s middle school friend 七宮智音(shichimiya satone).<br />
<br />
六花(Rikka) determines to forsake her identity as 邪王真眼(The EYE) for the sake of 勇太(yuuta) who is concerned about her mother, acquiesce to her family&#039;s will. She becomes a marionette. But 勇太(yuuta) reminds her of their love contract and lends a helping hand to 六花(Rikka) to achieve closure. 六花(Rikka) regains the identity and becomes a 中二病(Chuunibyou) girl again.<br />
<br />
S1 resolves 2 problems: first it is how 六花(Rikka) accepts her father&#039;s death and second it is whether she should leave off being 中二病(Chuunibyou) as a result of opposition from her family, which is settled thanks to the power of love and 勇太(yuuta) accepts her for who she is. That means their love relationship won&#039;t be easily disrupted because of any other people&#039;s disapproval.<br />
<br />
The reason why 六花(Rikka) is still a 中二病(Chuunibyou) girl is that her identity 邪王真眼(The EYE) is inspired by Dark Flame Master&#039;s behavior and their love contract is made between 邪王真眼(The EYE) and Dark Flame Master.<br />
<br />
Whether current situation is a problem needing to be resolved or not depends on sequel which is S2.<br />
<br />
P.S. The confession sence of the last episode is so sweet that I will never get bored of watching it.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I think of S2:<br />
<br />
There are also 2 problems to be solved in S2.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately 七宮(shichimiya)&#039;s one-sided love plot(problem) is a trivial subplot. It feels plain and dry. She almost solves the problem on her own. In other words, there is nothing to be expected from her plot. There is no place for 六花(Rikka) or 勇太(yuuta) holding an important part in her plot. Taking this subplot away doesn&#039;t affect the main plot, the love relationship between 六花(Rikka) and 勇太(yuuta), at all.<br />
<br />
The other problem is how 六花(Rikka) weighs her love against her identity, i.e. 中二病(Chuunibyou). S2 spends 3 episodes(EP07, EP09, EP10) on this problem. EP07 brings out the dilemma. If you&#039;re in love relationship, you&#039;ll lose power of 中二病(Chuunibyou) gradually until you become ordinary. Either you forgo the love, or you lose all the power eventually. &quot;It&#039;s a great chance for 六花(Rikka) give up her identity owing to LOVE.&quot; I thought. And that&#039;s what the 3 episodes suggests. However, at the end of the 3rd episode, 六花(Rikka) upgrades her 邪王真眼(The EYE) out of the blue without paving the way before it happens. In fact, you can possess them both! 七宮(shichimiya) makes a fool of herself. Her determination and choice is completely worthless and meaningless. The decision 六花(Rikka) makes not only conflicts with what it has implied but also ruins the character 七宮(shichimiya) thoroughly. The way how the problem is resolved leaves a unpleasant taste in my mouth throughout the rest of the Anime.<br />
<br />
in short, the love relationship in S2 between them is highly enjoyable and humorous, yet makes no progress. S2 can&#039;t hold a candle to S1.<br />
<br />
<br />
The flaw of the Movie [as the sequel of S1&amp;S2]:<br />
<br />
The quandary 六花(Rikka) comes up against is identical with the problem in S2. Her choice is also the same. What&#039;s the point of reproducing the problem that has been resolved? It&#039;s redundant and pointless, unless a different answer is given. To make matters worse, 七宮(shichimiya)&#039;s reiteration of her standpoint &quot;one or the other&quot; ruins the character once more. Moreover, there is a pressing situation. Nearing the graduation from high school, what if she isn&#039;t able to be admitted to university while being a 中二病(Chuunibyou) girl? Movie digs a plot hole at the beginning, but the hole remains the same at the end. Or the answer Movie gives is solely a word &quot;LOVE&quot;. This solution blatantly abuses power of love. Either way, the outcome isn&#039;t satisfying in the slightest.<br />
<br />
It is downright inconsistent concerning how the Movie paves the way for the ending. If what the Movie conveys is &quot;As long as someone that is close to you accepts you for who you are, you don&#039;t need to grow.&quot;, the Movie should focus on 勇太(yuuta) rather than 六花(Rikka) struggling on her own. If 六花(Rikka) learned how to &quot;restrain&quot; it, then the primary part of the Movie ought to be plots showing how she interacts with outside world. However, I have seen either one of them. Apparently the core of the Movie is the cute and sweet interaction between the couple instead of aforementioned speculations.<br />
<br />
<br />
All in All, either the Movie try its best to pander to its fanbase, or the execution is so contradictory to what it wants to pass on that I can&#039;t sense a logical purport of the Movie.<br />
<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
S1 is like udon noodles. It has a major problem needing to be solved.<br />
<br />
S2 is analogous to curry soup. It has nothing significant comparing to the major problem in S1. But overall it&#039;s sweet and heartwarming.<br />
<br />
While you think of the chef puts slices of beef on noodles, instead the chef pours a pool of mustard(Movie) on the noodles, stirs the mustard into curry soup, messes the noodles up. That&#039;s what the Movie seems like in the series.

    *This review contains spoilers.*<br />
<br />
The Chuunibyou movie is the long-awaited conclusion to the Chuunibyou series and takes on a more &quot;back to the roots&quot; approach to the series. After the failed second season, we see many things back again that made the first season enjoyable. The cast has been mostly reduced to it&#039;s core: Yuuta/Rikka and Dekomori/Nibutani got most of the screen time and Yuutas and Rikkas relationship finally got some more development. Extensive fantasy battles based on how the characters view themselves are also back.<br />
<br />
The premise of the story is simple and straightforward: Yuuta and Rikka are now in their third year at high school

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284872">
        and Rikka still has her eighth grader syndrome. As such, Touka is concerned about Rikkas future and wants to take her to Italy. This comes as a surprise to both Yuuta and Rikka, as they don&#039;t want to be separated. After a suggestion from their friends, Yuuta and Rikka decide to flee from Touka and go on an adventure trip through Japan. I want to highlight the setting here because it&#039;s always a breath of fresh air to not have a movie play in high school, but rather somewhere else. <br />
<br />
Most of the movie is the focus and Yuutas and Rikkas relationship and the crazy antics of Dekomori and Nibutani while they are trying to catch Yuuta and Rikka. Dekomori and Nibutani provide most of the comedy in the movie because they always end up together in hilarious situations and are under constant pressure of Touka because she wants to leak a photo of them kissing. On the other hand we see Yuutas devotion towards Rikka: He is serious about wanting to be at her side and unconditional love is highlighted: Even though Touka pushes Rikka to mature, Yuuta loves Rikka for what she is, either with eighth grader syndrome or without and he is content with the fact that Rikka is growing at her own pace. It&#039;s also shown that Yuuta puts Rikkas happiness before anything else: While on their trip through Japan he uses his money to buy her a ring, rather than spending the money for his own use. Meanwhile Rikka is conflicted with her feelings: She believes that the the moment she loses her eighth grader syndrome, Yuuta will stop loving her because she won&#039;t be the same person anymore. It&#039;s first through Yuutas reassurement that she begins to understand that it isn&#039;t her eighth grader syndrome what Yuuta loves love about her. In the end this leads to what fans have waited more than 5 long years for: They share a hug and a kiss together.<br />
<br />
Other characters thankfully had their screentime reduced. This is especially important for Shichimiya, Makoto and Kumin as neither of them has ever contributed much to the overall course of the story. Shichimiya pretty much ruined the second season alone so it&#039;s good to see her back only as a support character with little screentime.<br />
<br />
The movie is also full of fanservice. And I&#039;m not talking about Ecchi here. While on their trip, Yuuta and Rikka visit many known places from other KyoAni shows: A bridge from Hibike Euphonium, the restaurant from Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu, the store from Tamako Market. The movie also references other elements from KyoAnis shows such as the official artworks of Kazumi Ikeda and the opening where Rikka is walking along a meadow with her umbrella is a reference to Violet Evergarden. DekoMoriSummer shippers will probably have to screenshot half of the movie because Dekomori and Nibutani have quite some suggestive and ambiguous scenes in this movie.<br />
<br />
Overall, I think this movie is a good conclusion to the series and everyone who liked the Chuunibyou series before will definitely love it.

    Exactly what we can expect of the anime, this movie is exactly what the anime is, it kind of remind me of the lasts episode of Toradora. Humerous scene are placed at the right moment and they dont take too much place in the movie.With them we are able to release the tension created in the second part of it, excellent part because we can see how Rika&#039;s mind evolve, a mind fighting for and against herself. The ending was unexpected, i don&#039;t have the words to describe it except it&#039;s an ending to close the book of two teenagers becoming adults.

    The movie is very cute, as one would expect. It seems as if the entire story and all of its characters were created just to be as cute as possible. The only problem is, it ends up being the story of an abusive relationship that is portrayed as very happy and loving.<br />
<br />
Allow me to explain: Yuuta Togashi is a serial domestic abuser. There is almost no chance that he and Rikka would be able to live together happily. He constantly berates her, physically hurts her when she does something he doesn&#039;t like, and tries to control every aspect of her life. He shows no signs

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302548">
        of caring about her in the slightest.<br />
<br />
When he hits her or pulls her hair or flicks her eye, there is no playful intent. She is genuinely hurt by his punishments. When she tells him that he has hurt her, he never apologizes.<br />
<br />
He drives a wedge between her and her family, degrades her friendship with Dekomori, and forces her to maintain the personality he wants when she desires to change, and she doesn&#039;t change only for the fear of losing his affection, a fear which he does nothing to dissuade.<br />
<br />
The movie, and the show as a whole, had the potential to be a fairly good comedy about teenagers acting like idiots and living in their own world. Instead, it&#039;s an awkward romance between two characters who have no business being in any kind of serious relationship with anyone.

    Take On Me is a journey where Yutaa takes Rikka on around Japan, to escape from reality and to discover deeper feelings on their stagnant love relationship.<br />
<br />
The story of course, revolves around Yutaa and Rikka the love couples as they are now seniors in their high school last year where they haven&#039;t made any further progress in love, as expected since the 2nd season even though they live together. But when Rikka&#039;s sister, Touka-san planned to take her to move to Italy, everything changed. Out of suggestion from the gang, they eloped around Japan with the pursuit of her sister and the two friends that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302111">
        were threatened with certain secrets. Both being underaged, tried to survive in the realistic world as they find their objectives along the way as he takes her on.<br />
<br />
Their runaway is portrayed in such a way that it gives you insight to the struggle of both person that loved Rikka, namely Yutaa and Touka where they both insisted on their way and only wanted Rikka to be happy. And Rikka, to make a decision that would decide their future.<br />
<br />
Moving on the characters part, the good news is the gang is back as a whole! The senpai, Kumin still seems to be oblivious as she was of her surrounding, loves to nap but gives wise advice occasionally. Nibutani and Dakemori are back with more of their fights, their quirks and their disagreement over trivial matters. Shichimiya still maintains her role from season 2 as the friendly girl who aids Rikka in making important decisions with her past experience and the cheerful laugh that she tried to seal her feelings with. Then there&#039;s Ishikki. A ghost bald boy who appears out of nowhere as quick as he is to be ignored by Yutaa. <br />
<br />
There are certainly deeper characters development on Rikka and Yutaa in this final ending and more screen times for the entertaining duo - Nibutani and Dakemori and cheese as the story progresses.<br />
<br />
To the arts part, Kyoto Animation certainly has their way with it, portraying the characters&#039; personalities to its finest. Not to mention depicting the beauty of the many different landmarks that they have travelled together to, and using each setting to bring out the effects of different scenarios. The sparkling eyes, of course steals the spotlight the most, just like it did in Hyouka or Violet Evergarden. <br />
<br />
The eyes brings out the essence of the characters and the thoughts and feelings that they wanted to say but couldn&#039;t express it. Yutaa and Rikka  met at the first time with their eyes staring blankly at each other, and it ended with it as well, but this time, as they look into each other&#039;s loving eyes, it reflects the whole adventure and dramatic conflicts that they have faced until the end.<br />
<br />
The songs are complimentary and exceptional, where &quot; Take On Me &quot; is used as they carry out their runaway from the evil Touka-san and her &#039;underlings&#039; to portray the fun that they had with a bit of wanting to do more. The outro song, &quot; Kokoro no Namae &quot; just deeply echoes Rikka&#039;s wish to be together with Yutaa without worries and how she is afraid that changes will lead to her losing him.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment is great as well, with the entertaining fights from the duo from time to time, the shy actions from Rikka and the overall adventure that she shared with Yutaa adds a little excitement to it. There are also some random scenes of Yutaa asking &#039;God&#039; to help him whenever he is clueless that shows how he appreciates the relationship and doesn&#039;t want to make a wrong choice. Even if one is not hooked up on to the theme, one can still enjoy it as the story is well-constructed and doesn&#039;t jump around to fit the plot and the cute romance of the shy couple.<br />
<br />
Overall, Take On Me will present you a beautiful ending the first season ended with, utilising the build up of emotions from the second season to give a perfect closure that everyone wanted so badly. A promising closure that evokes the feelings that got you in the first season, and gives an extension for their journey that they will continue together. <br />

    This movie doesn&#039;t add anything to the series.<br />
However, it does a good job at providing fans with more content while it is still enjoyable to watch.<br />
<br />
I respect any sequel or movie that doesn&#039;t screw up even if it doesn&#039;t manage to improve anything.<br />
<br />
Dislikes: <br />
<br />
1) The &quot;kami-sama&quot; insecurity skits which make Yuuta look like an ordinary harem MC. They kinda made up for it with the punchline at the end but that wasn&#039;t worth it really..<br />
<br />
2) Some of the emotional scenes didn&#039;t have as much weight to them, especially the last ones, I don&#039;t really know why but it didn&#039;t move me. Perhaps it&#039;s because the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315819">
        wording wasn&#039;t powerful enough or maybe because they moved too quickly.<br />
<br />
Likes: <br />
<br />
1) I Loved to see the relationship between Dekomori and Nishihiko, the fun they were having felt so real and a really good move forward from how they acted toward each other previously, seeing them finally open up towards each other.<br />
<br />
2) Details, like the addition of a second umbrella and the scene where they meet at the end waving their arms and hands toward each other with windmills moving in the background, those were really cool. I think they lacked a little bit of power for everyone to notice but I&#039;m happy they were included.
