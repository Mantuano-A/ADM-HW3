    If you’re watching this, you surely know the gist of the story and enjoy it, so I will save you the details of Bookworm’s plot. <br />
<br />
Bookworm II picks up right where the first season left off and does everything the first season did even better. We’ve got a wider range of characters who bring a diverse set of personalities and backgrounds to the stories as well as the continued development of Main as a priestess. <br />
<br />
Whereas the first season revolves around Main’s relationship with her family and local friends, the second season mainly focuses on Main’s relationship with the church and her retainers. I enjoyed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344732">
        that quite a bit as it was an opportunity to learn more lore about the church and its role in society. The show continues to be very character driven and self contained. It’s not overly ambitious in its story and instead crafts a narrative about how the little things we do can affect others around us. <br />
<br />
I really enjoy the laid back approach that this series takes and found every episode to be enjoyable. The world is so lush and beautiful thanks to Aijia-Do’s great art and the direction continues to be top notch. If you enjoyed Bookworm I, you will love Bookworm II. If you’re new to this series and are thinking of giving it a shot, I highly recommend it. This is certainly one of the best isekai currently being written. Bookworm II gets 9 printing presses out of 10.

    It is a nice anime, but after reading LN, I cant shake a feeling that story events are not so much events on their own, but only summary of what happened in LN. Anime feels a bit hollow in comparison, there is also some missing material, that I cant decide if it is because of censorship or just too fast story progression to properly develop some of supporting story characters.<br />
<br />
I recommend reading LN, it is a way better experience with way less story holes. It is a good read. It is a nice anime to watch, but it just doesnt compare to the source material.

    Ascendance of a Bookworm has a special place in my heart since it is a story that I never knew I wanted.  A certified bookworm myself, I&#039;ve always loved fantasy, but seeing a great fantasy story combined with the deep love of books that this series brings to the fore is absolutely magical.<br />
<br />
Now, to the business of the review.  If you loved the first season of Bookworm, you will love this season as well.  First, the world-building in this series continues to be on point.  The medieval period is a popular stomping ground for fantasy, but this series does a much

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344741">
        better job of portraying the nitty-gritty aspects of every day life in that culture.  For the vast majority of people, life was dominated by the concern &quot;how am I going to keep myself fed and clothed.&quot;  Bookworm hits this nail directly on the head.  Considering the otherworldly nature of our protagonist, it would also be easy for the series to fall into the trap of people in the past are stupid, while modern people are smart.  Bookworm does not do that in the least.  People in the past are respected as intelligent, even superior to our protagonist in many ways.  To wrap up the topic of world-building, I must mention that Bookworm also dodges the bullet of &quot;all nobles are bad, all commoners are good,&quot; quite an accomplishment considering that a major driver of the plot is class conflict.<br />
<br />
Second, Bookworm has amazingly authentic characters.  While each character has a primary drive, Bookworm keeps that from completely defining them as a person.  Characters are unique individuals, and the size of the cast given this respectful treatment elevates this accomplishment to the next level.  If you love seeing well-realized characters each with their own personalities and motivations, then Bookworm is an anime for you.<br />
<br />
Third, the second season has a great mix of slice-of-life style plot with portent of greater events to come.  For those of you who love slice-of-life, you will love bookworm.  While some slice-of-life anime tend to be episodic, with marginal character or plot advancement from episode to episode, Bookworm has the full slice-of-life feel while actually feeling like real life.  Things change from day to day, week to week, month to month, and when you look back you see that life results in progress.  Myne matures as a person, she makes progress in her goal of making books, Lutz become a better merchant, etc.  To me, this shows true mastery of what the slice-of-life genre can be.  For those coming for the fantasy, believe me, you will not be disappointed.<br />
<br />
Bookworm is not without its flaws.  Though I wouldn&#039;t call the soundtrack bad, neither is it at the level of Made in Abyss (though the OP and ED are simply excellent.)  The art style is well suited to the work, and the backgrounds are clean, but the animation quality can be a little lacking.  For a work that isn&#039;t high action, the level of animation is definitely excusable, but still nothing to write home about.  One thing the animation did succeed at is in Myne&#039;s facial expression repertoire, which has impressive diversity and is often quite unique.<br />
<br />
All in all, Bookworm was the anime I looked forward to most every week this season.  It was an excellent continuation of the prior season, and I&#039;m not ashamed to say that it is a masterpiece (at least in my book.)

    Honzuki no Gekokujou: Shisho ni Naru Tame ni wa Shudan wo Erandeiraremasen 2nd Season (2020)<br />
<br />
What a season, for me the first season and its OVA were very good but not so amazing. I found Maine hard to like at the beginning and the story was a bit slow in my opinion. But here we have a superb second season that blew my expectation away. <br />
<br />
For a continuation they really pulled out the stops which shows the author did a great job with their content to allow such an adaptation. This season has twists and turns, the evil and good of noble society and some real

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344738">
        story progression that is satisfying. You get so much out of this it was superb. <br />
<br />
The art is much the same as the first season and its OVA set due to being so close. I would say in some ways it is much more refined in its finer details. <br />
<br />
The OP is good but I prefered the first seasons. The ED is better and flows nicely. The general world is superb but I would have liked more depth in the magical sounds. <br />
<br />
Characters ie Maine develops heavily and she gets some tough characters to deal with and the consequences are legitimate. You get some really great storytelling with this one. Seeing Maine take on retainers proved a first real push and then the second ones were handled great. In the end, we have a great cast of characters. <br />
<br />
Overall, I would absolutely ask people to watch this. Be warned like me you may have some crying moments, especially in the last episode. <br />
<br />
In the end, we get a and so the story continues style frame but I am unsure if that is a season 3 or read the rest. I would go by the ratings thus far in the hope this will continue through animation.

    The continuation of Ascendance of a Bookworm felt like a straight line that barely shifts up and down. It felt like an additional to the first season, which of course is totally obvious as this is the second season with the differences being the fact that this season had more society-class discrimination. There&#039;s nothing so great about this season yet the story still captivates my heart despite being gone for about nearly half a year.<br />
<br />
The only bad thing about Ascendance of a Bookworm is the fact that its main protagonist, Myne is  kid. And as I hate kids due to their voice and how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344848">
        they act, I often find Myne and other kids retarded at times as I watched the show. However, despite all this Ascendance of a Bookworm is probably one of the anime where I accept the fact that kids are just kids and I shouldn&#039;t judge them strictly. This is because the story of Ascendance of a Bookworm is so magnificent, it carries about 1/2 of what the show lacks. <br />
<br />
Another fun season. I am hoping for more. Should one watch the second season of Ascendance of a Bookworm? I&#039;d say yes 100%.<br />
<br />

    I can certainly say so far. That season two of bookworm is really holding it&#039;s own. The arc that it&#039;s covering is really good, and it&#039;ll be great to see how further it goes, and here is why!<br />
<br />
The story follows the first season from where we left off, and really gives us a good look into Myne&#039;s new role, and the hardships she&#039;ll face. Sure she&#039;s had hardships before, but it feels like there is even more pressure now. It&#039;ll be interesting to see how she handles it. <br />
<br />
The cast returns as normal, though some are less seen at the moment than others, but that&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337128">
        mainly down to a few new cast members that add their own to the story, and in some cases, you really feel for them, as you&#039;ll see by watching the show. Poor Myre really has got her hands full so far.<br />
<br />
The art and sound is what you&#039;d expect from the first season, colourful, shiny, and all of the above. Very nice.<br />
<br />
S2 of bookworm is really good so far, and I&#039;m sure it&#039;s gonna get better, so give it a go!

    Ah, Ascendance of a Bookworm, the series I was most looking forward to this season. And I know I&#039;m not the only one. <br />
<br />
Isekai has become a VERY popular genre. We all know this. Some of them are great! Some of them... not so much. But, Ascendance of a Bookworm is a show I highly recommend to anyone even slightly intrigued by the concept of being sent to another world. Having finished the first season, I can say that with confidence. Especially since that quality has continued on with season 2. <br />
<br />
In a show without a lot of action and combat, the characters and the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339443">
        plot and the worldbuilding have to be on point. Luckily for us, Bookworm nails those elements perfectly. I am intrigued by every single character they plop in front of us and they fit into the story so well. Main is a wonderful protagonist, and the idea of telling her story from the perspective of a child is such an interesting concept. <br />
<br />
This season continue&#039;s Main&#039;s story as she dons her Blue Priestess apprentice robes and takes on the trials of the church in order to save herself from her mana eating disease. That&#039;s a lot for a seven year old to go through. Plus having to win over almost everyone in the church that seems to hate her? That&#039;s rough. <br />
<br />
I think Bookworm is setting up a great story here with the potential for something big. Again, it does its world building and it does it well. It has its incredibly funny moments, with jokes that really land. It has its lighthearted and cute moments that make me gush and fall in love with the show and its characters and the world they live in. But then it has hardships and serious moments that make me hate everyone that&#039;s ever done wrong in this world. It&#039;s immersive, it&#039;s enjoyable, it&#039;s addictive and I highly recommend that anyone who isn&#039;t watching or reading Ascendance of a Bookworm to correct that immediately and hop on board!

    As it stands right now, I really like it. The art style is nice and has a soothing pastel feel. The story is intriguing, though it feels a bit rushed. As it is, I will pick up the LN. What about the music? I Listen to it well I edit and write, as I love it.<br />
<br />
The characters and plot are the strong suits, but what I love most is Main. That&#039;s not to say the others aren&#039;t good characters by any means though. I&#039;ve often thought about Main&#039;s morality, to be honest.<br />
<br />
Altogether, I love it so far, can&#039;t wait to pick up the LN.

    With the end of the current season, I didn&#039;t think I would find myself actually sad to see an anime ending. Most of the shows either had a horrible conclusion or a satisfying one but I never wanted to see more of them and was content with just reading how it ended. Now, I&#039;m really sad to see an anime as good as this one ending specially as this may be the last time I ever hear about the characters&#039; lives with no season 3 announcement at the time this review was written. <br />
<br />
Honzuki no Gekokujou is, in my opinion, the best isekai anime out

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344889">
        there. It may not have the most intriguing story but it has the most important aspect of every anime or show in general, it has amazing characters. <br />
<br />
The characters in Honzuki are the best well-written characters I have seen in anime in a long while. The depth of every character and how they showed their emotions was just stunning to see. With the great development of Mine in season 1, I never even thought she could get as much development yet here we are at the end of the season, watching her develop into an even greater character. <br />
We are also introduced to lots of side characters and their problems. Stories of losing loved ones, assault, starvation and just leading a horrible life yet still trying to maintain their sanity and change when meeting Mine. A well-written cast that you see get enough development throughout the anime and yet it never felt rushed or half-assed. The characters really were amazing. 10/10.<br />
<br />
The art of the anime is as great as ever, the sound, the animation and the overall directing of the anime was astonishing as season 1 was. <br />
<br />
Overall I would give this season of Honzuki a 10/10. I know I wrote this at the start but I really am sad this ended but I&#039;m glad I got to watch it. <br />
Would recommend it to anyone wanting to have a good time and watch one of the best characters ever made.

    I really love this series. I started to watch this season since it’s further along in the story then the manga. If you enjoy this series, I highly recommend giving the manga a shot. Since it doesn’t have to cut scenes short and isn’t on a restricted budget. Haven’t read the light novel, so I can’t say anything on that.<br />
<br />
 Update: the animation has improved. Episode 6 doesn’t feel suffocating to watch. Since characters didn’t stay in a still environment for long periods of time. There is some real great animation at parts (facial expressions). Making them over exaggerated. Which makes you think “wow. I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338564">
        really wish it was all like that.“ It’s a shame that it isn’t constant, but it’s really nice too see when it does happens.<br />
<br />
The animation can feel awkward at times. And makes you feel as though the world they live in is still. <br />
Some scenes have been cut short and could easily be improved by wording things differently, or by adding in another sentence or two. Overall it’s good. <br />
<br />
I started watching season 2 to know what happened next. I’m a sucker for spoilers. I enjoy both reading and watching.

    I loved the world-building of this show so much. I wouldn&#039;t mind a timeskip, but the pacing was fantastic. Every new episode is a new opportunity to see the characters&#039; grow at their own tempo, organically through the story. The world of &quot;Honzuki no Gekokujou...&quot; itself is a fascinating one to discover and explore slowly and gradually, with each subsequent episode. <br />
<br />
Although the animation budget clearly wasn&#039;t very high for this production, the quality shows where it&#039;s important. The magic system is solid, and isn&#039;t just a bunch of explosions but rather complex, focused enchantments and spells to make miraculous things happen. That is exactly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344836">
        what this show was: a miraculous thing.

    And we are back with Mayne! The first season was a great discovery, and this second season remains in its lineage and goes even further<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
The second season makes a fairly radical change from the first, because now the story focuses on the Church and Mayne&#039;s new position as a blue robe<br />
We thus discover the mode of operation of the Church, as well as the whole system of caste and nobility (where the first season revolved more around trading, merchants and peasants)<br />
The story is cut out in the form of challenges and obstacles that Mayne continues to encounter. After having finally obtained what she wanted

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345230">
        (access to the library), her preoccupations will move away (only partially of course!) from books in order to take an interest in the people around her.<br />
<br />
Art: 5/10<br />
It&#039;s the only flaw of the anime in my opinion<br />
The level of animation is low and this is particularly felt in certain scenes (such as the last arc with the Knights and the gorgeous non-animation of their mounts)<br />
The artstyle is sometimes shaky but I don&#039;t mind at all. It is really the lack of animation during certain scenes which gives a certain ridiculity to this anime<br />
However, note the effort not to use CGI in anything<br />
<br />
It is however a shame to see that Ajia-Do apparently sacrificed the animation of Bookworm and preferred to focus on Kakushigoto, another anime from the studio having been released at the same period.<br />
The lack of animation is visible but personally it does not lower my general appreciation of the anime<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
It is generally the weakest point of my reviews because I do not pay much attention to music except when it is impressive<br />
If most of Bookworm&#039;s OST are...normal, I noticed some remarkable and surprising pieces at several times<br />
The anime also uses a good number of traditional instruments (or at least, it gives the air of it), which strongly strengthens the integration into the universe of Mayne<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
The cast of Bookworm has grown significantly with the arrival of Mayne at the Church<br />
The introduction of her servants (not to be confused with those of Fate) allowed several key characters to intrude<br />
It was very nice to see the evolution of these characters (my favorite being Fran), even if I find that the mini-arc of Delia resolved a little too quickly<br />
The development of the character of Mayne is more discreet but is present enough to be noticed, without it making a 180 ° so far<br />
My favorite character of this season will however be a new one: Ferdinand<br />
He is understanding, affectionate towards Mayne (and even becomes his confidant) but that does not prevent him from berating her when necessary, and guiding her in normal times. Mayne owes him all the good things that has happened to her in the Church. He is a very well written and highly sympathetic character<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
Following Mayne&#039;s adventures is always a pleasure<br />
I never thought I would appreciate an isekai like this, a slice of life moreover, and that it could distract me as much<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
This second is in line with the first<br />
If we can blame it for its weak animation, we can forgive it because this anime is really a hidden gem !

    Isekai Bookworm is back for Part 2, the continuation of the 2nd half of the remaining 12 episodes, and I&#039;d have to say that while the content for the 2nd half was another solid effort, it was kinda downplayed after the strong foundations of the 1st half. Don&#039;t get me wrong, it is a good watch, but as a whole when it&#039;s compared to the source material, it lacks finesse and proper story progression.<br />
<br />
The story with Part 2 (the Apprentice Shrine Maiden arc) continues our blue-haired childish girl&#039;s dreams of wanting to read and make books, now descending onto the Church, whose noble state is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344693">
        one of disrepair, and attaching with it, the politics and power play that comes with tormented abuse. Myne is only there as a means to cure her growing mana (which she had from the Devouring back in Part 1), and of course, the library, because books come first than others.<br />
<br />
The measure of being a commoner in royal clothing is something that Myne constantly has to bear her position in the Church, to whomever resides in there as means to oppress people where and when they like it. All these is wrong, but Myne has no power to stop it, and besides, getting yourself in trouble only builds a bad rap to your name, and Myne doesn&#039;t want that, so it&#039;s really testing her nerves. Together with High Priest Ferdinand, Myne goes through her adding number of responsibilities and work, one day at a time. One good thing is her own personal growth, compared to the beginning of Part 1, Myne has fully grown and outdone herself in ways that I could say it&#039;s just character &quot;development&quot;, but it&#039;s development truly different, yet fascinating.<br />
<br />
New to Part 2 is, of course the side characters, plus some new oddities of Myne&#039;s growing responsibility: the grey-robed assistants (or rather the untouchables). As a noble, every noble has to attach themselves to a grey-robed servant, and Myne has 3 in toll: the aggressive Gil, the annoying devil Delia and right-hand man Fran. It&#039;s easy to see why there is a lot of disdain between the nobles and commoners, but for Myne, the biggest challenge is to persuade them to her side and be fellow good people, regardless of their ulterior motives. Most certainly, flexing her position as a noble gives her the identity to do as she pleases, but with the rotten Church system, it&#039;s clear that something must be done, and she will take up any case, so as long as the dream of reading books isn&#039;t negated.<br />
<br />
All things otherwise, it&#039;s about what you&#039;d expect from Part 1, with the same artwork and visuals. I certainly don&#039;t ever think that Ajia-Do would have perfected this even much given the seasonal gap to improve some aesthetics, but what is given to us the audience, it&#039;s passable enough.<br />
<br />
Same goes with the sound, the VAs still doing a good job at the character roles given and such, adding that blend onto the anime. And of course, new OP/ED which is good, but I&#039;d take Part 1&#039;s set anyday as it expressed the emotions better.<br />
<br />
Overall, Isekai Bookworm was a good watch, and for the uninitiated, having to binge through all 26 episodes really spoke volumes about how this series really eventually came into all on its own and carving its sense of identity. If you can, I&#039;d suggest binging from the beginning to get the full experience about this overlooked hidden gem that&#039;s an Isekai, but a vastly different type of Isekai out there.<br />
<br />
Fun times indeed.

    Ascendance of a Bookworm was hailed as one of the best isekai ever made. Something which the fanboys say for every isekai there is, therefore this statement means nothing. What matters is the execution, which for this show was supposed to be how it’s not a power fantasy about a male loser getting reincarnated into a videogame where he is overpowered and forms a harem while fighting the demon lord with his broken superpowers. This show is better because the protagonist is a girl, there are no videogames, no harem, no demon lord, and no superpowers. It’s a simple coming of age, about a simple

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404134">
        girl, in a simple medieval setting. Or so it was at first, because that is no longer true by the end of the second season.<br />
<br />
But first things first. Every story need to give the viewer reasons for keeping up with it, and this one offered a down to earth isekai. It had a heroine who was struggling to achieve small victories in an almost mundane setting with not much to struggle towards. On top of that she is not exceptionally powerful just because she got isekaied, since she has a very frail body that can kill her if she works hard or if an incurable disease kicks in. Plus she can’t even openly say she is from a different world, because the church is going to execute her as a witch. Plus, because the setting is medieval it lacks even the most basic luxuries and services we take for granted in our contemporary society. They still have slavery and public executions and women wish to be sex toys for men. Thus everything she does is seemingly harder than what it would be in our world and thus every little victory she achieves comes off as rewarding despite being mundane as hell for the rest of us. Or so it was at first, because that is no longer true by the end of the second season.<br />
<br />
Anyways, since we need a plot so that the show won’t be a slice of nothing happens, the heroine sets forth to read books. Something a bookworm like her finds to be super important, although it isn’t, but we need her to have an obsession over something, so we can also have an objective. Otherwise there will be no plot. Thus we spend the first few episodes in her trying to find books to read only to find out books are very expensive and very rare and there are no public libraries because the setting is medieval. Thus she sets forth to… print her own books (wut?). Because the most logical thing you can do when you can’t read books, is to print your own books, so you can read… your own books (wut?). If this sound like a really stupid leap in logic, get used to it because it’s going to keep happening every few episodes and by the end of the second season the objective will have moved and changed so many times and the initial premise will not matter in the least. In fact it won’t even make any sense. Why did the heroine spend all those episodes in trying to print books when show could simply join the church that was full of books? It’s basically a plot hole that renders most of the first season completely pointless.<br />
<br />
This is the main problem with the show. It keeps changing the objective every few episodes and becomes more and more distant from what it was in the beginning. Although it is normal and expected to have changes happening in a coming of age story, in this case the changes betray the premise and gradually change the show to a more mundane fantasy adventure. The sickly typical girl that makes you so happy to see her achieve small victories becomes a super awesome teacher and super awesome inventor and super awesome merchant and super awesome cleric, while everyone around her are constantly amazed with all the stuff she can do. And boy does she enjoy the attention by constantly smiling smugly. How is this not empowerment fantasy, just like any other isekai?<br />
<br />
And it doesn’t stop there. Her sickly body that could kill her with simple daily activities ends up having a dark superpower hiding inside her, which makes her far stronger than most people. There goes that appeal, she’s another shonen protagonist with a demonic power inside her. Oh, and that part about not being able to reveal she is from another world because she will be executed? It got revealed eventually, a priest tried to punish her, she used her awesome superpowers for force-chocking the guy ala Darth Vader and then she got forgiven because her super important knowledge of our world will make her kingdom very powerful. What happened to the whole fear of dark magic they all had all this time and how is this not empowerment fantasy, just like any other isekai?<br />
<br />
You think it stops there? In the first episodes there was no magic for making things easier. The setting was almost magic-free. By the end of the second season there are huge magical trees and flying lions and knights that use magic to protect the world from evil. Which means there is demon lord out there and they want to use the heroine for helping them in defeating him. The show became just another isekai.<br />
<br />
Therefore Ascendance of a Bookworm is not a good show, it’s another generic empowerment fantasy that took its time before revealing its true colors as another light novel piece of trash and betraying any good thoughts you had about it.

    Ascendance of a Bookworm is now a well-known anime with a relative unanimity around its quality. I review the S1+S2 here. (english is not my primary language)<br />
<br />
I have been quite disappointed by these two seasons... <br />
<br />
The anime is the story of a 20-year-old librarian who is reincarnated in a 5-year-old girl body after her death, in a new fantasy/medieval world. All the anime spin around the fact that this new world has not yet invented the printing and so books are rare and expensive.<br />
<br />
The anime have a lot of problems in its writing and I will discuss about them, but before, let&#039;s talk about the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349062">
        art and the OST. <br />
The art of Ascendance of a Bookworm is a bit &quot;cheap&quot;, with a bad animation on certain scenes and a drawing a bit strange, particularly on faces.<br />
The OST of this anime is not good at all. We have not a single one recognisable theme and OP/ED are not good. This last point is a very bad point for me : in this type of anime I like to be transported by a strong OST.<br />
<br />
The story and the universe of the anime is, from my point of view, not well written. The loop of the anime is simple : the girl knows technologies and things that don&#039;t exist in this new world, she recreates it and this is a success which permits the girl to progress in the social structure of this world in order to achieve her final goal : creating a lot of books. <br />
<br />
The main problem with this loop is that the universe is constructed to permit this, and this is not done delicately ... <br />
<br />
All the world of this anime is improbable and not well executed. The absence of some tech is not credible for the level of civilisation of the world, and the success of the girl invention is too quick to be credible.<br />
<br />
The writing has also a lot of inconstancies : one scene the heroine, after having created a book with soot ink, smell the book and say « huuuummm, the good odour of the ink », referring to the nostalgia of books smell in our world. But hey, you just print a book with soot remember, it should smell soot, not modern ink ... <br />
It&#039;s a small detail, but all the anime is written like that, and after 27 episodes it is very visible. <br />
<br />
Another problem is the reactions of adults to the heroin experimentations and inventions : everybody give her full trust, way too easily. She is a five-year-old girl, her inventions should, sometimes, bring some suspicion. It is never the case in the anime.<br />
<br />
The last bad point of the anime is the nature of relations between the heroin and the other characters, specifically in the season 2. In the season 2, the anime takes a strange turn : it becomes an anime on commercial relation between people and on servant/master relationship. And this is strangely executed. The heroin will always construct her relationship with her acquaintance in a mercantile like way : contracts, or material rewards/punishments .<br />
<br />
For example, at some point in the anime it happens that the heroine picked up the management of an orphanage with a lot of starving children, and to remotivate orphans she will cancel the charity organisation (everybody had the same meal in the orphanage) to go to a commercial organisation : those who work better will have a better meal. <br />
It&#039;s a bit choking, for me, to see that. It&#039;s like, in kindergarten or middle school you change the meal relatively to the notes of the student in class. It&#039;s a bit revulsing. And the fact that here it&#039;s starving children didn&#039;t help with my feeling about that.<br />
<br />
Another part of the anime is about the relation master/servant. The heroine has some servant and will act in the same way : material rewards and punishment to construct her relation with them. It&#039;s very cold and the feeling of the « superior noble enlightened heroines » who manage her herd of servants with a good little candy and pat on the back to motivate them to be good servant is a bit too much for me in this anime. <br />
<br />
All the S2 is like that : cold relationship based only on mercantile considerations. <br />
<br />
So well, I didn&#039;t like the direction of the anime in the S2. <br />
<br />
The combo of inconstancies, strange orientation of scenarios and relationship between characters in the S2 and poor art and inexistent OST make, for me, the anime not very good. <br />
It&#039;s still watchable, so for me it&#039;s a 6/10 for the S2 and a little 7/10 for the S1.

    You could say &quot;Oh! Finally a sequel. Yay!&quot;, but you will be pretty disappointed.<br />
<br />
Creators continue to speed the main storyline as fast as they can. The 12th episode is absolute garbage. Even I would make up better ending episode then them.<br />
<br />
 Now without further ado let&#039;s rate it.<br />
<br />
    Character design 4/10:<br />
 All characters seem like they are dead. As a viewer, you can&#039;t feel with them. It <br />
 is like watching a fish. And on top of that, some don&#039;t have any development. If <br />
 you want good characters then this is not for you.<br />
    Soundtrack &amp; OP,ED 6/10:<br />


          <span style="display: none;" id="review345697">
        The opening is pretty fine It reminds me opening from Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai.<br />
    Art style 3/10:<br />
 Like really It&#039;s 2020 and it looks worse than Clannad.<br />
    Enjoyment 7/10:<br />
 I Am glad that I had taken those drugs before watching this sequel. Now for real, <br />
 I liked the first season of this show I was even so generous and forget some <br />
 nonsenses that they had made and gave it 8/10, but this for real? From creators <br />
 that made some amazing shows to make a show like this. Meh! I maybe tolerate <br />
 it the first season, but now I Am very upset.<br />
    Story 4/10 --without any comment-- <br />
 An overall score from me is 6/10<br />
Yea, deal with it.

    Isekai is a genre of anime that has a lot hate aimed towards it, despite its popularity among casual fans, most serious anime fans appear to dislike self-insert harem stories with an overpowered main character, which appears to be a norm among isekai series. The previous installment of this series was an exception to the standard isekai rules, it had all the right things going for it. A detailed world, careful development of the main character, interesting and realistic goals to pursue, and a very peaceful atmosphere with minor problems. Sadly, this season does not live up to the standards set up by its predecessor,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344690">
        while it’s still an interesting story overall, at some point this this series started to take itself too seriously and lost its charm. This review will expand on why this season, although better than the average isekai, does not live up to the greatness of the original.<br />
<br />
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
<br />
The main character is named Myne or Urano in her past life, she’s a frail blue haired child who just really loves books, so much so that the show is literally titled ascendance of a bookworm. In her previous life Urano dies tragically in an ironic manner when a shelve of books, the thing she loves most, falls on her during an earthquake. After this she is reborn in the body of Myne a frail girl who lays in bed all day. In the first season the primary antagonist was a supposedly incurable disease Myne faced, however that is long past us now and Myne is happy and healthy. However, this has come with its own problems, the series stopped focusing on Myne’s pursuit of books outside of a few episodes and mainly focused on Myne dealing with pain in the ass elitist nobility along with her trying to solve various issues at the church. The original goal of her mass producing books is brought back near the end of the season and it was definitely the best part, however the show losing sight of its main focus early on really hurt it this season compared to the previous.<br />
<br />
Some other aspects of the show that were a bit of an edge topic but were carefully handled were the concepts of child labor which Myne exploits to mass produce her books and get other work done, but in turn provides a decent livelihood for the kids. I enjoyed how the show wasn’t biased in one way or another with this, it acknowledged that Myne realized she was going to use child labor and couldn’t be too charitable but at the same time it also acknowledged that before the kids had jobs their lives were even more dismal and hopeless.  The show isn’t to heavy handed with morality and understands that not everything can be black and white, and sometimes you might need child labor, or the use of threat of  being fired, against your workers to actually get things done and in turn improve life for everyone else.<br />
<br />
Overall this was a solid installment of the story, it would have been rated higher if it were focused more on Myne achieving her goals of making books or running her businesses instead of dealing with nobility but it seems like this was a necessary development for her to begin integrating into the church.<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
<br />
As stated in an earlier review, the art style is very basic, and the show also has very basic animation overall, this series doesn’t really have particularly detailed character designs or backgrounds either, however overall this is fine. This not an action show, it’s been made fairly clear that the story is intended to be more about Myne achieving her goals and political struggles over actual fights. The few times action was required it was executed tactfully and carried the weight it should, otherwise the relaxed art style and character designs create a very open atmosphere that carries the mood of a bustling historic city. The simplistic style and reduced body animation also gave the animators time to focus on Mynes facial expressions and her inner thoughts, which were hilarious and well needed in a show that is primarily focused on conversations and character interaction over fights and action sequences. Overall, although the production quality isn’t particularly good, it doesn’t hurt the show, and in fact improves its atmosphere and helps bring the characters to life when it’s necessary. One aspect that is however worth noting is that the production did seem to take its fantasy elements seriously, and we got a considerable improvement in visuals whenever something involving magic was shown on screen, this was definitely a good choice and the animators spent their time quite effectively by focusing on bringing this fantasy world to life whenever it was needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
The sound: 7<br />
<br />
The music isn’t anything unique but it supplements the show well, I cant really find any glaring flaws with it, and the opening is pretty solid overall. Overall its around a 7, nothing impressive, but its not bad and as long as it serves the series well its doing its job. The sound effects themselves fit the show and did not actively detract or hurt the overall atmosphere, it perhaps could have been better produced but the music is not what the audience came for in this series.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8<br />
<br />
Myne and Lutz are the 2 real main characters, but the entire cast is quite colorful, and I think they were all decently developed. Lutz got more of a background when his family problems were finally explored and we learn that although his dad did not approve of his new job, he was really just being tsundere and most of the issues of Lutz becoming a merchant were resolved. There were a number of new characters introduced as well, at first, they were hard to like but they became more enjoyable over time, their personalities were designed to reflect those of people who lived in a feudal society, which is where a lot of the friction between them and Myne came from. I definitely did not expect to like Fran but over time he came to grow on me as did the new grey robes under Myne.<br />
The high priest also got a decent amount of screen time, outside of Benno and Myne, he is likely the only other intelligent character in this series. While Myne excels at business, she was never part of the elite in her previous life, so having the priest instruct her on how to act and live like a noble was interesting and provided growth for Myne in the new world. We also notice why the high priest initially investigated Myne in the first episode in season 1, there are a decent number of hints that imply he is aware that Myne is unrealistically intelligent, while at the same time lacking common sense about their world.<br />
<br />
Overall the characters are definitely the best part of this series, whether it be Myne’s family, her friends, her servants, or the authority figures she has to interact with, everyone is colorful and well developed, except maybe the nobility who the audience are supposed to hate. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7<br />
<br />
This was still a pretty solid season of bookworm, however the large change in tone and focus on the church from what the show used to be definitely did hurt my enjoyment. The story should be about Myne finding or creating books while integrating herself into this new world to the best of her ability, the journey of acquiring materials and creating new products from scratch along with the friendships acquired along the way made this show. Without the constant backdrop of Myne pursuing books and her focus on relationships with the townspeople, this season was missing something integral to what made the prior season great, Myne’s family, friends, and goals set this show apart from your standard isekai, adding power struggles and side goals detracts from what made this enjoyable in the first place. Due to all of the aforementioned reasons this season is a point lower than the previous season, but overall it’s still a solid season and if you enjoyed the previous there is no reason why you shouldn’t watch this one.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7<br />
<br />
I give this show a 7, it just does not live up to the previous season due to the short sighted focus on a specific issue that dragged on to long and distracted Myne from her true goals, however its still not a bad season and overall it is a solid show. There is nothing particularly good or bad about its production, the characters are still great, even if the story overall took a hit. <br />

    With the 2nd Season 3/4 of the way now feels like the right time to see how it stacks up to its predecessor.<br />
<br />
If I liked the first season will I like this?<br />
<br />
Yes that is most likely the case. The 2nd season builds on the 1st with a whole new area of the city, the cathedral and with it adds new characters, new dinamics and new challenges for our loveable bookworm Maine. As far as the visual style , music and the tone it still feels the same, it´s still Bookworm  but hey Bookworm is a wholesome package that i really enjoy so i ain´t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review342165">
        complaining.<br />
 <br />
It´s fair to say the animators also had a lot more liberty with Maine´s facial expressions and her inner chibi monologues with both of those being a lot funnier to watch (I want my own Bloody Carnival xD).<br />
<br />
The new roster of characters are all quite interesting to ok at worst. But by far the show´s best new addition is the head priest (HP for short). His character is quite interesting to watch and his dynamics with Maine (Maine is honest and easy to read in terms of emotions, while HP is the opposite) as they go from interesting to outright hilarious as he stands as the much calmer and wiser mentor to Maine. He´s not as easy to like as Benno (Merchant) in 1st season but as you get to know him I would say he turns out to be  my favourite character by far.<br />
<br />
He stands as the reflection of the shift in world for Maine from her dealing with peasants and merchants to her dealling with nobles and the church. <br />
<br />
This rise in position leads to a bigger impact in the world which is really starting to kick into overgear at the end of this season where Maine´s actions (primarly in wanting everyone to have books) are starting to impact not just her friends and family but society as a whole . This makes the historian side of me delighted as I know the role the wider access to books had on our history and in breaking the status quo .<br />
<br />
Make no mistakes it´s still a show about books and our bookworm but while the first season felt like the growth of Maine, who is a bookworm, the second season lives more to it´s name as we see the ascendance of a bookworm <br />

    Story 7/10<br />
<br />
This season is based mostly on Myne’s interactions as an Apprentice Priestess in the church while I enjoyed this season and its story I didn’t think it was as strong as the first season as there wasn’t enough happening outside the church. This was still good though as we learned more about the church and the world and how backwards their attitudes are outside of the Head Priest Myne is able to make some changes though and these changes further Myne as a character and allow her to follow her dreams.<br />
<br />
Art 7/10<br />
<br />
I do like the art style here with good artwork on the world

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344974">
        and the characters.<br />
<br />
Sound 7/10<br />
<br />
Reasonable sound and music with decent voice acting.<br />
<br />
Characters 7/10<br />
<br />
I still like Myne as a character and Ferdinand the head priest is a good character however I thought the support cast was not as strong as the first season.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 7/10<br />
<br />
An enjoyable 2nd season although as mentioned above this was not as good as the 1st season it did have some good moments particular when Myne was able to make important changes in the church which improved the lives of the other children although some of the episodes towards the end were a little weak.<br />
<br />
Overall 7/10<br />

    This review is for both season 1 and season 2, which as of the time of this writing is the entirety of the series. A third season has been announced, but it&#039;s not a thing yet.<br />
<br />
As a whole, I wanted to like this series more than I actually did. It has modern visuals, an original story, respectable world-building and character development and a few wholesome moments that&#039;ll make you feel warm and all that good stuff. However, there are two major, major issues with this series that each colossally detract from my ability to enjoy it and there is just no way around either of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review398842">
        them. They are as follows-<br />
<br />
1. Pacing<br />
<br />
This anime is very slow and it never picks up. The beginning, middle and end are all slow, all dialogue heavy and all repetitive. There&#039;s more or less zero combat in this anime, zero subplots, zero deep development of side characters... The whole anime focuses solely on the main character and every single episode is just her talking to people. It&#039;s simply monotonous. If this anime opts to exclude content to break up the monotony it needed to trim the fat somewhere (fewer episodes, faster pacing, more conflict, etc).<br />
<br />
2. Believability<br />
<br />
I&#039;m okay with the base premise- Adult woman dies and gets reincarnated into the body/mind of a child in the distant, less technologically-advanced past. Totally fine. What does not work is how nobody questions the behavior and capabilities of the main character in a remotely meaningful way. Her vocabulary, manner of speaking, knowledge, skillsets, conceptual understanding... really everything about her is far, far, far beyond the capabilities of the smartest 5, 6 or 7 year old in the world and she would stick out like a sore thumb immediately to absolutely any adult she interacts with. This is downplayed or outright ignored throughout the entire anime. The few characters that do notice these things quickly write her off as &quot;a weird kid&quot; or &quot;unusual&quot; and don&#039;t ever think anything more of it. It is completely, utterly, even with the utmost stretching of plausibility, entirely non-believable. In this regard, the plot simply fails, as the things the main character does/says/knows are wildly beyond the scope of a child and the anime wants you to outright ignore that and roll with it. I could not.<br />
<br />
Personally, my favorite moments in this anime were the wholesome scenes between the main character and her family. They&#039;re poor, they&#039;re ordinary and they&#039;re largely underdeveloped and underutilized but if nothing else they really, really love Myne. There was an especially heartwarming scene about half way through the anime that for me was the apex of the show, but the program never quite approached that level of emotional depth any time after. I would have really, really liked more scenes like this, but by and large her day to day conversations simply aren&#039;t all that exciting or important.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day this isn&#039;t a bad show, but if I&#039;m being honest it&#039;s slow and it&#039;s boring and its plot isn&#039;t believable and I just can&#039;t see past those things. I&#039;ll watch season three sometime down the road, but I won&#039;t be foaming at the mouth for it by any means. This, for me, is a wonderful anime example of &quot;mediocre&quot;.<br />
<br />
OBJECTIVE RATING- 6.75-7<br />
PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 6.5
