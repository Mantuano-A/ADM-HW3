    Hitman Reborn was initially recommended to me by my friend. However the story looked dull and uninteresting to me, and I was also not sure if I would like it (I watch anime like Bleach, DGrayMan etc.) Thus I started off with the manga. The first thing I thought when I read the manga was &amp;quot;WTH is with that stupid looking baby? The main character is also so badly drawn!&amp;quot; However, after reading a few chapters, I got hooked and finished 100+ chapters in a day. I decided to give the anime a try, as I wanted to see how well the characters could be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9415">
        brought to life.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The only thing that prevented me from giving a 10/10 was that the story took waaaaaaay too long to start! Sure, the first 20 episodes were amusing and had me cracked up, but there was no real storyline to it. The anime was also inferior to the manga in my opinion, as they had more fillers and also took out the guns and knives (and Tsuna&#039;s reactions to them) that would have made the whole thing even more hilarious. However after that the real action starts, which had me hooked all the way! The storyline is extremely unique, and Tsuna&#039;s irritating underwear transformation thing became less frequent, and finally disappeared altogether :D It is also way different from most shonen anime, which usually only consists of blind fighting and no development at all. In all, an amazing storyline! (After the first 20 episodes, that is, but don&#039;t skip till there, have a look at the characters!) :DD<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
I would give it an 8/10, as the characters in my opinion were not very well drawn. The characters usually look fine, however weird if shown from different angles. However the animation was okay, the fighting scenes were well animated, and I especially enjoyed looking at Tsuna&#039;s weird faces whenever Reborn is up to his antics again x)<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
In my opinion the OPs were the BEST! Drawing days (First OP) had me addicted the first time I listened to it. Except for OP3 (Jumping Days I think), I just didn&#039;t like it at all D: The voices for the characters in my opinion were well matched and I just loooooooove them, but Tsuna&#039;s voice is still a little weird to me (Too high I guess). The BGM, however, was AMAZING. It totally brings out the mood in whatever is happening and will have you paying attention to it in spite of the action going on! Each character&#039;s theme was also awesome, especially Hibari and Gokudera&#039;s theme.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
In all, the characters were what makes Reborn a kickass anime! :DDDD It is amazing how some characters who only appeared for comic reliefs could get so serious and awesome whenever they needed to! The way the characters have matured is the main factor that kept me hooked onto the series. The transitioning is so subtle, you wouldn&#039;t even notice how much they&#039;ve grown until you think back and remember how they used to be (Remember whiny old Tsuna?) The different personalities that match each of the characters and the way they follow such an unlikely boss is truly cool! :DDDD<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I enjoyed Reborn as a whole, except for the first 20 episodes (It&#039;s TWENTY hello) but the storyline and arcs later on made up for it, and also the character&#039;s ridiculous antics which really give the series a light feeling, yet serious when needed.<br />
<br />
Overall, if you&#039;re looking for a new anime to watch, try Hitman Reborn! It may seem boring at first, but persevere on! Until the main story starts, there is a good chance that you&#039;ll be hooked too :D And the storyline is amazingly unique, I&#039;ve never seen any anime like it before xD <br />

    Katekyo Hitman Reborn is an outstandingly well made anime. I definitely recommend that you watch it if comedy and action applies to your genre of choice.<br />
<br />
At first glance, Katekyo Hitman Reborn may seem boring. The major flaw of the anime is that it absolutely misleads you, and it completely deceives you into either a) dropping the anime or b) thinking the anime is lame, when it isn&#039;t! <br />
The first 20 episodes may mislead you to drop the anime, just like it misled me, because of its fillerlike episodes. You will most likely tell yourself &quot;Wow, this is really lame. What&#039;s the point of all this?&quot;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15170">
        That&#039;s what I thought, but I gave it a chance. (And I&#039;m SO glad I did. Katekyo Hitman Reborn is now my absolute favorite anime.)<br />
<br />
The beginning is kind of slow and different from the rest of the later episodes, because apparently KHR was initially meant to be a gag anime - it was supposed to be something funny and comedic. The anime took a different turn as you progress to episode 20 into something more serious.<br />
<br />
The first 20 episodes is merely a /long/ introduction to the anime. It&#039;s worth watching though, because you get to be familiar with all the characters. They are all likeable! If you decide to watch Katekyo Hitman Reborn (and I hope you will!) you should decide whether you like it or not, after 25 episodes or so. It&#039;s only fair, right? All animes have their flaws; and it&#039;s flaw, in my opinion is that they don&#039;t give it a decent start. If you do not have the patience for that, then this anime may not be for you. <br />
<br />
Storyline:<br />
Katekyo Hitman Reborn deals with the mafia. Tsuna, the *main* character, is in the next line to be the 10th boss for the Vongola Family~ (one of the many families in the mafia.) Reborn, a hitman, and also a baby (hehe), travels from Italy to Japan to tutor Tsuna to become a worthy boss for the Vongola Family.<br />
From then on, Tsuna&#039;s adventures and what he experiences are endless-- but they&#039;re all interesting. Over the course of the anime, Tsuna grows and matures, and becomes really strong; fighting his enemies and getting stronger each fight he experiences. The fights he encounters are well made, and they WILL keep you at the edge of your seat. Tsuna isn&#039;t the only one fighting, though-- he also has a &quot;family&quot;-- his comrades, if you will, and the battles they encounter are endless. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art is well made; I don&#039;t think there is much to complain about it.<br />
It isn&#039;t outstandingly good, nor is it horribly bad to a point where you have to shield your eyes. The characters are wonderfully drawn and are all unique in their own ways. The art progressively gets better as you further get into the anime.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The sound is absolutely AMAZING. It deserves an 11/10, as opposed to a 10/10.<br />
I loved all of the openings, and endings-- I never once had to skip it; and that&#039;s kind of rare, considering the fact that I&#039;m absolutely picky with my music.<br />
The soundtrack is amazing as well, there is a couple of them for EACH character (well, the main characters, anyways.)<br />
They have a soundtrack for every different scene in the anime, and it is absolutely positively pleasing to the ears. Everything about it is EPIC!<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
The characters are very well portrayed; you can&#039;t help but love all of them (well most of them anyways.) They change greatly over the course of the anime and it&#039;s worthwhile to watch them grow up.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I love Katekyo Hitman Reborn! I love everything about it; it makes me laugh until I fall off my seat and look like a loser, it makes me sad as they go through their hard times, it makes me happy as they overcome their obstacles-- and so on.<br />
I can ramble on forever about how much I love the anime, but I&#039;m going to end now, before I end up typing a ten page paper.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Katekyo Hitman Reborn is an AMAZING anime as I mentioned a billion times (well not really, but let&#039;s pretend.) I highly suggest that you go off and watch it right now, but I can&#039;t tell you what to do. It&#039;s ultimately up to you.<br />
Everything about it is amazing- it&#039;s storyline, (although it may seem boring at first) it&#039;s art, it&#039;s sound, it&#039;s characters-- it&#039;s everything!

    Story - 8<br />
<br />
Hitman Reborn is a pretty unique anime in my opinion. There is one major flaw in the story that prevents me from giving it a full 10. The first 20 episodes or so have no real story arc. While each episode is interesting and helps develop the characters it takes way too long for the story to truly begin. But I will say this. The story arc in this anime is top notch. Once you get to episode 20+ you will be watching the episodes one after another after another. I am anxiously biting my fingernails waiting for the next episodes to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5315">
        subbed!<br />
<br />
Art - 8<br />
<br />
The artwork in Hitman Reborn is decent. The lame underwear morph on every episode for a while is what brings the grade down a bit, but Tsuna begins to look awesome about 25 episodes in, when the underwear morph becomes not so common and is replaced by something else. The other characters are also drawn very well.<br />
<br />
Sound - 9<br />
<br />
The soundtrack for Hitman Reborn is awesome both opening and ending songs. The japanese voices all fit the characters as well. The only reason sound isn&#039;t a 10 is because of Tsuna&#039;s voice in underwear mode. It gets so annoying during the  few long sequences.<br />
<br />
Characters - 10<br />
<br />
The Characters are all unique, with a wide range of personalities all following an unlikely protagonist. Quite frankly i&#039;m jealous of Tsuna. Hes got the perfect range of friends all with flaws that fit the characters as well as strong loyalty to him. The characters couldn&#039;t be more enjoyalble. (Save for Tsuna in underwear mode) (Lets face it Underwear mode sucks &gt;.&gt; Thankfully it practically disappears entirely once the true story arc starts.)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 8<br />
<br />
Unfortunately Hitman Reborn loses 2 points here because of how long it takes to get rolling. It seriously has much too long of an introduction phase. If I were to rewatch Hitman Reborn I would start around episode 15 or so. That way you can get a memory of the characters before the story starts. You wont miss practically anything and you&#039;ll be loving Hitman Reborn from the start.<br />
<br />
Overall - 9<br />
<br />
Overall Hitman Reborn gets a 9. It truly is an awesome anime that will keep you hungering for more once it gets rolling.

    &amp;ldquo;WHAT THE HECK IS WITH THAT LITTLE CHIBI DUDE?&amp;rdquo; I thought to myself when I watched the first episode of Kateikyoushi Hitman Reborn! aka Katekyo Hitman Reborn. What was with the really silly protagonist? Why was he such a wimp and loser? And what was with his weird &amp;ldquo;transformation?&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s so bloody revolting and crazy. I thought that the anime was on crack&amp;hellip; Seven months later, I took the advice of a friend and decided to give this anime a second chance. <br />
<br />
After the second episode and a bit of my own research for random other information and media of the series, I fell in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1821">
        love. I also was VERY addicted. I became current with the series in four days; I even endured a rough night and watched 20episodes in one sitting. Anyways, arhem. Let me go into further detail of how my fanaticism for this series began.<br />
<br />
Okay, well, I actually thought the first few episodes were rather ridiculous, still. I kept on watching them, though. I mean, who can turn down a Mafia-based anime, anyway? Episodes, nevertheless, turned out to be so incredibly ridiculous that I just had to watch more and more because of the hilarity and comedy I found within the first twenty episodes. To my surprise, I really could not give up on any of the &amp;ldquo;Filler&amp;rdquo; episodes or beginning episodes because I was already hooked on the craziness of the series. And although the beginning got way too episodic and &amp;ldquo;lame&amp;rdquo; (e.g. like Bleach, D. Gray-Man, and Naruto), I did not give up hope for the series to improve and for the story to develop. The beginning helped create a very fine atmosphere and background for the lifestyles of the protagonists. Once the plot began to reach its first &amp;ldquo;arc,&amp;rdquo; or main story, I was amazed by the sudden turn of events. It was a very pleasant surprise to find the main characters undertaking actions to carrying out a rather &amp;ldquo;dangerous task.&amp;rdquo; After the arc finishes, there are a couple &amp;ldquo;Filler&amp;rdquo; episodes but, they do not entirely intend to act as such because they do develop towards the next arc. The second arc is full of great action and thrill. As of right now, it is still underway. And, as I write this review, I am very anxious to watch more! <br />
<br />
EDIT: Wanted to revise this a bit... since I&#039;ve watched 42more episodes... my impressions of the anime have slightly changed... I&#039;m still a die-hard fan of the series, I have to say... the storyline has indeed slowed down after the second arc, and well... Filler episodes became a bit more trivial and useless... Regardless, it&#039;s been on track again to a third arc for the last few episodes. And yet the annoying thing is that, as some people have said, there&#039;s always a flashback to what&#039;s happened so far... Like from in Bleach. And so, the plot has slowed down tremendously... The characters are still very original and entertaining to observe in developments, though... All other aspects are still very true, though. :P So be sure to keep with this series for it&#039;s uniqueness in many other aspects and well general theme. :P<br />
<br />
Another reason why I love this series is obviously because of the character development and portrayal. The characters are all just so amazing and cool in their own special ways. Each character possesses a unique and different personality from every other character. From the first impressions of each character, I was rather disgusted. But upon learning more about each character in time, I grew to love each and every character because they each had a special charm or trait that seemed very personal and almost real. I felt very connected to several characters. Furthermore, the character development was not slow at all. Okay, there were a couple cases where the character flash-backs got a bit tedious to watch, but there were sufficient amounts of information to obtain in the meanwhile, so I was not too frustrated with them. Then, information given about the characters were developed into the story in a rather formal and thorough manner which I felt was effective for letting me know about each character. As for a few characters, I have felt (and sometimes still feel) a bit irked by them and their funky and somewhat &amp;ldquo;naturally&amp;rdquo; irritating personalities. However, as the story has progressed, I want to say that the characters have grown on me. And now, I appreciate the existence of every one of the characters, and hope to watch (and read) more about them all.<br />
<br />
What also helped me get more into the anime was the animation. Initially, I found it a bit funky, but I watched more and began to realize it was actually pretty impressive. The graphics have been, for the most part, to my standards at least, above par. Everything was quite thoroughly illustrated and never too flashy, abrupt, and messed up. Action scenes were detailed and well scripted and screened. The art styles were well designed, too. I found that the characters and settings did not lack too many details from the original artwork. <br />
<br />
Now as for the music&amp;hellip; I loved all the sounds! &amp;lt;3<br />
As in, I have listened to the soundtracks and opening and ending theme songs of the series so many times that I think it may be too excessive. I don&amp;rsquo;t recall too much insert music, but that does not take away from the series since the other sound effects and background music have suited well for all the situations and scenarios of the anime. Sometimes, the music gets a bit wacky, but those are obviously for the funny situations that are in the anime. For the fight scenes, there is more than reasonable usage for action music. Thrills and suspense are well built into scenarios due to the special styles of background music used. Special other sounds are also very appropriated &amp;ldquo;placed&amp;rdquo; throughout the series. From the countless times I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to each and every theme song used, I still cannot get enough of the fabulousness of each song. I enjoyed the opening theme songs so much that I had to watch them all for every episode that I watched in the last four days. Now, yes as much of a waste of time that might have been, I could not get enough of it. The &amp;ldquo;shot&amp;rdquo; selections used during the theme songs were neither that great nor that terrible, but I found that they worked fine. And, as long as the songs are good and the shots used are not that revealing nor weird, I could deal with it.<br />
<br />
Altogether, I found that the animation company that produces this series was able to pull through every episode very well. I did not feel like they wasted much of my watching time at all because everything seemed at least 25% relevant to the story if not also sparked my interest in watching more. Really, I felt that the plot has moved at a very steady pace that still stirs anxiety and curiosity because of major cliffhangers. I cannot get enough of this series. This is one amazing manga series that has been adapted into an anime that has lead me to enjoy the story in a very wonderful and exciting way. For a load of laughter, adventure, and action, be sure to give this anime a try.

    Reborn is a generic shonen people may tell you it’s more than that but   really it isn&#039;t the story is pretty interesting for a shonen a mafia story sounds cool right? Sadly we have a terrible protagonist which whines a lot characters like shinji and kamille do this a lot as well but their reasons are justified in their series. As they do have actually mental issues tsuna does not show this yes you can say it’s a fucking shonen but hunter x hunter had a psychologically distraught protagonist as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Tsuna is a generic high school teenager which has the hots

          <span style="display: none;" id="review194197">
        for some girl and doesn&#039;t have the balls to do anything about it standard  shonen cliché’s.  The art is fairly mediocre as well the action scenes look alright for a shonen but everything else looks so bland and generic   especially the character designs. <br />
<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is very forgettable as well nothing really stands out except for the openings  they are  pretty great l think l like all the reborn openings which is really rare  the last one is my least favourite though. <br />
<br />
<br />
 The characters god fucking damn it the characters l  think  l already talked about tsuna enough he is a standard generic shonen protagonist  which wants to protect his friends  also he dosen&#039;t want to become a Mafioso even if it runs in his family&#039;s tree his character is just so infuriating the other main characters are fairly forgettable as well  only character l really remember fondly was hibari because he didn&#039;t give a shit about anything that happened   none of the characters get a huge amount of significant development for a 200 and something episode  series.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is also quite a lot of filler in reborn especially in the future arc with the girls cooking food and going on strike and it  all feels quite pointless   for a shonen to have  it was probably there to save  money because l don’t remember  the filler scenes going for as long as they did  in the manga.<br />
<br />
<br />
While l do have a lot of complaints with the story and the characters l did enjoy myself with the show it was a fun cheesy shonen just   don’t bother with the manga it gets even worse especially with the manga ending which l won’t spoil.<br />
Overall Hitman reborn is a fun generic shonen it does hold a special place in my heart though because it was one of the first shows l ever watched when l first got in to anime.<br />

    Amazing anime. Will make you laugh, smile, shout and cry.. <br />
Just DON&#039;T judge the anime by the first 20 episodes. Watching till 20 I was ready to quit a few times, but i read some good reviews so i kept watching. If you cant stand them at all, DONT skip em! Just be patient. These episodes are to introduce some of the characters, and of course make you laugh a lot! <br />
The only drawback of this anime (personal opinion) is it&#039;s art. Sometimes characters&#039; and backgrounds&#039; art aren&#039;t good at all, since the detail is too low. <br />
&quot;So why should i watch it then?&quot; you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179117">
        may ask, the answer is simple: Just give it a try and you will understand why I&#039;m giving it a big 9/10 no matter the drawbacks mntioned above!

    In the last ten years, there has been a significant decline in the style of shonen action anime. I went from growing up with gritty titles like Bio-Booster Armour Guyver and Fist of the North Star, to over-marketed fan service like Bleach and Soul Eater. I&#039;ll put the &quot;old anime guy&quot; rant aside for sake of this review, which is a show that isn&#039;t too different from the aformentioned titles.<br />
 Katekyo Hitman Reborn is not a very good anime. It isn&#039;t, but it&#039;s also not the worst I&#039;ve ever seen. This anime had potential to be moderately decent, but suffers from most of the same

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30964">
        problems that hindered Bleach into a tailspin. I wanted to wait until I reached the future story arc before I wrote my review for this show, as this was apparently the money storyline. Admittedly, I wanted to see just what this was about. Now that I&#039;m about halfway through KHR, I have just what I need to write a proper review for this. I&#039;ll break it into the good and bad of Katekyo Hitman Reborn.<br />
<br />
[THE BAD]<br />
THE ACTION: While it&#039;s not as bad as Bleach, the fighting is just as obnoxious and probably sillier. Battles used to mean something in action shows, now they have dissolved into the method of following in Dragonball Z&#039;s footsteps: forget about subtext and just make your fight as loud as possible. It&#039;s bad enough that the skills these characters use look completely ridiculous, even by shonen standards, but they could&#039;ve been utilized on a level that wasn&#039;t brain-numblingly stupid. I&#039;ll fix some of the stupidest ones right now.<br />
1. Bianchi&#039;s Poison Cooking: Would it have been that hard to just have her vex someone&#039;s coffee with arsnic instead of producing plates of food out of thin air and shoving it in someones&#039; face? It&#039;s hard for me to take this even remotely serious when you model a fighting style I&#039;ve seen in Looney Tunes.<br />
2. Get Rid of the Boxes: Really? Amano was so out of ideas, he had to rip a bit from a 13 year-old kid&#039;s show that already spawned a generation of Pocket Monster knockoffs? This gimmick was incorporated to increase it&#039;s female fanbase, because it&#039;s cute when Hibari summons a spiky hedgehog. That&#039;s fair game in my book; you need to increase your demographic, fine. But what&#039;s infuriating is the fact that every cast member that fights already has an established fighting style. Adding this only makes the fights more overbooked and complicated than they already are. It&#039;s such a cheap plug for a card game, I was expecting a starter deck to pop out of my C drive.<br />
3. XanXus&#039; Jet Handguns: Ben 10 is calling, and Heatblast wants his powers back.<br />
<br />
THE COMEDY: Comic relief doesn&#039;t work when every single character has a satirical shtick. By trying to make every character funny, the jokes don&#039;t bounce off anyone, and you just have method actors reading catchphrases. <br />
 &quot;Gotta....stay...calm&quot;<br />
&quot;ROMEOOOOO!!!&quot;<br />
&quot;TO THE EXTREME!!&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#039;ll bite you to death&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#039;m the Tenth&#039;s right hand man&quot;<br />
&quot;Ku fufu&quot;<br />
&quot;I have to deliver these noodles&quot;<br />
 This is overkill. These jokes are repeated anytime one of these acts are on the screen, and they are long past being fresh. Actually, to call them jokes would be insinuating that they were at some point funny. Without a balanced set of personalities (a catalyst, the butt of the joke, an instigator, and a straight man), humor doesn&#039;t work. Since there&#039;s no set up or punchline, the characters just scream at each other all day, and it&#039;s grating. How many times does Gokudera need to double over in agony after seeing Bianchi? Dr. Shamal wasn&#039;t funny back when he was Master Roshi. And Ipin&#039;s forehaed bomb is about as amusing as a root canal. The only character that truly makes me laugh is Haru Miura. More on her later.<br />
<br />
THE PLOT PACING: The story(s) are slighty better than I would expect, but nothing above moderate. In fact, the plot could be a lot better if everything wasn&#039;t so drawn out and uninteresting. I won&#039;t harp on the endless amounts of filler (it&#039;s become almost a necessary evil in anime today), but rather the parts where things are supposed to be happening, but it prolongs simple development to the point where it grinds to a halt. Not a spoiler, during the Millefiore raid, Gokudera actually wants to STOP THE ATTACK so Yamamoto can talk about the Arcabaleno. Top it off with the fact that everything seems like it&#039;s kept a secret from the audience when it&#039;s just another new character reveal. Byankuan (I think I butchered that name) is supposed to be the main antagonist, but they have not given me a reason to hate him. It&#039;s becoming a pet peeve of mine when bad guys now just sit in chairs and LOOK evil instead of doing villainous deeds. They told me he runs a very powerful Family that can crush the Vongolas in 23 seconds, but has failed to alluminate on that, instead telling me how animals kept in boxes can turn the tide in a battle. On a side note, I think the Black Spell and White Spell guys look too much like Soul Reapers and Arrancars for my taste. It&#039;s just another stark reminder as to how little thought gets put into these franchises when four sets of cast members in two different shows dress exactly alike. Pitiful.<br />
<br />
[THE GOOD]<br />
 TSUNAYOSHI SAWADA: I never thought this would happen, and it took awhile, but Tsuna is actually a pretty acceptable main character. He&#039;s no Gon Freeces in Hunter X Hunter, but in today&#039;s age of shonen leads being just completely intolerable jackasses and ignorant A-holes, Tsuna is a significant upgrade from Ichigo Kurosaki and Ryoma Echizen in Prince of Tennis. Yes, he&#039;s whiny, whimpy, and seemingly &quot;no-good&quot;, but the real lighting-in-a-bottle of a character like this is watching them grow up before your eyes. it&#039;s what I loved about Gohan, though the saiyan&#039;s road is far more memorable and cohesive, Tsuna&#039;s metamorphosis into an independent pillar of valor is a something I can take away as a mild success from this. He&#039;s incredibly down to earth as well. All he wants is to win the affections of Kyoko, yet his own fantasies about marrying her and impressing her are so low-barred, it&#039;s like his brain is actually telling him he can&#039;t do it. I find that a little refreshing. To grade him on a letter scale, I&#039;d give him a C average.<br />
<br />
 THE GIRLS: I always get the impression that shonen authors don&#039;t like to write female characters, what with the way they all follow the familiar pattern of being completely bitchy, nagging, hostile shrews like Bulma, and good ladies in shonen like Rukia get shelved and taken out of the show for episodes on end. The female cast of Hitman Reborn has been one of the reasons I made it as far as I have. While this mainly pretains to Kyoko and Haru (Lal Mirch and Chrome aren&#039;t presented enough at the point I&#039;m at. Especially poor Chrome, she&#039;s the worst treated character in the whole franchise), I really like Tsuna&#039;s mother and even Bianchi has moments when she plays the big sister to the others. But man, Haru Miura has become one of my favorite supporting characters ever. Her off-beat wackiness, unpredictable sense of style, and unbridled enthusiasum picks me up everytime I got the urge to drop this show and became the heart and soul of KHR for me. her cheery theme music is like a Phoenix Down being dropped on my head after one of those silly box battles. The only other character to breathe this much life into something that didn&#039;t seem that good at first was Hime in Princess Resurrection last year, and that&#039;s now one of the best titles I&#039;m currently reading. The ladies in KHR are always a healthy break away from the stupidity of the fighting and hackneyed dialouge, and are the best girls going in shonen for me today.<br />
<br />
NOSTALGIA: While the humor fails and a good chunk of potential character development gets lost in the mundane battles, KHR has a certain feel about it that hearkens back to the classic days of shonen action series. The characters, while paper thin for the most part, are seemingly vibrant and full of life, like Yu Yu Hakusho or Power Stone. The setting and envoirnment isn&#039;t always dark and gritty like in Naruto or Bleach, and stays lighthearted enough to be a tongue-in-cheek action show, even if it is a little bit long. The intensity of the plot kind of picks up when a villian shows up, even if they lose steam halfway through the arc. If this show had come out in 1998, heck, even 2002, I would&#039;ve fallen in love with it because it retains a glimmer of the spirit that most shonen titles lack nowadays, and that all I ask from this genre. Not Shippuuden.<br />
<br />
IN CLOSING: This was long winded review, and I apologize. I can only hope the readers understand my frustration with thinking out a meticulous review for a show that&#039;s almost down the middle, it&#039;s not a &quot;bad&quot; 5. This was a mixed bag for me. There&#039;s a lot I really hate about this show that I can relate to other shonen title mentioned in this review and probably rant about for another eight paragraphs, and while the bad outweighs the good, it comes down to quality of the good over quantity of the bad, and those elements have kept me watching KHR for over 100+ episodes, and is a testament to doing just enough right to keep me entertained. I can&#039;t say the same for Bleach and Naruto, which I&#039;ll never finish.<br />

    Katekyo Hitman Reborn, commonly referred to simply as Hitman Reborn, is the comedic story of Sawada Tsunayoshi (Tsuna) and his training in fulfilling his duty as the 10th generation leader of the famous Vongola Mafia Family.  Though this is a story about mafia families and such, by no means is it all dead serious as you expect mafia-themed plots to be (i.e. Gungrave).  Quite the contrary, this is a comedy anime and is a very hilarious show.  <br />
<br />
Tsuna is trained by Reborn, a very well-known hitman throughout the mafia world, but the catch here is that Tsuna is your everyday klutz who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review632">
        has no good qualities about him, hence his nickname, &amp;quot;No good Tsuna,&amp;quot; and also not to mention, he wants nothing to do with the mafia.  While he meets many new friends throughout his journey who eventually join ranks with him to become his &amp;quot;mafia family,&amp;quot; there are of course people who want to see him dead so they can take his place.<br />
<br />
The story, while very unique as you don\&#039;t see too many mafia-based anime shows out there, definitely had more potential than what the final product has showed us so far.  The big reason that I state this is that there is a bunch of episodes, while not fillers, can be seen as stand-alone comedic episodes that don\&#039;t really have too much of a plot line to them.  The episodes that do have a plot, while they are extremely interesting, are unfortunately, go by rather quickly.  However, don\&#039;t let that be the reason to stop you from checking this out.  <br />
<br />
The artwork of Hitman Reborn isn\&#039;t all that bad, but isn\&#039;t anything special or spectacular.  Sometimes the animation just seems kind of plain, and many times during a few scenes you\&#039;ll undoubtedly notice how bland it is, but its bearable.<br />
<br />
The sound is also on the same degree as the artwork, nothing special, but not disappointing.  <br />
<br />
I believe what separates Hitman Reborn and makes it special from other shows is its characters.  They creators have done an excellent job in creating fresh, very unique and hilarious characters that will have you laughing at their antics in every episode (especially Lambo, who is just too cute).  The biggest, and probably the most surprising thing about the characters is how some of them are literally, baby-sized characters.  Reborn himself is no bigger than Tsuna\&#039;s head and while this fact may make you stray away from this anime, let me advise that it only helps in the comedy department, because the creators were able to use this aspect so creatively well.<br />
<br />
If you\&#039;re looking for a hilarious anime with very unique characters and some interesting fighting, look no further than Hitman Reborn.  This anime contains its fair shares of battles, action and romance to go along with the many laughs you\&#039;ll inevitably have.

    I&#039;ll be honest since most of the reviews in my opinion are usually really long and I end up generally skim-reading it so in light of that ill try to make mine as short and concise as I can. <br />
<br />
Let me just start of by saying I give the anime an overall of 10. My total experience left me completely satisfied although I wish the anime and manga continued since the ending was a bit blunt, however due to financial reasons on the companies behalf I understand that it didn&#039;t meet the funds required. <br />
<br />
Moving on, the story and characters were a solid 9 for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407981">
        me since I (***really slight spoilers***) found the idea of the ring aspect, 10 year bazooka, and future ark really cool entirely. Especially the few plot twists that actually surprised me occasionally here and there. The character development on a few characters are a bit poor I will admit, but some characters like Gokudera and the Arcobalenos i really enjoyed knowing their origin and how everything happened. <br />
<br />
Next we have the art and soundtrack, both I would give both of them around an 8 since it was made between 2007-2011 for that year and time, especially with their budget i&#039;d say was pretty enjoyable since I harbored no complaints and there weren&#039;t any sudden drops in quality. I personally was indifferent about my opinion on the outro but op&#039;s were really catchy and I did enjoy them. <br />
<br />
I&#039;d definitely recommend this to people who enjoy some comedy, action, shounen or any of the above. While Tsuna is an annoying wimpy crybaby at the start believe me when I say he gets alot cooler later on. I think its widely known that the first 19-20 episodes can be basically considered filler, I did watch them but on two times speed because I wanted a basic grasp on the characters. I&#039;ll also add that the story gets genuinely interesting after those 20 first episode and then by around episode 80 you&#039;ll be 100% attached like I was.

    KHR is like any other long shounen series; For someone relatively new to anime, it can be very fun and addicting. If you are too familiar with the tropes used in this genre, it can become a real chore and way too predicable.<br />
 <br />
Story: The plot progresses in the usual shounen way: The weak and optimistic protagonist trains, and starts fighting enemies who seem much stronger than him, and once he defeats them they often become his allies. The first 20 episodes were fillers, but since I found them funny I didn’t really mind. The battles drag out a bit sometimes, but they are well

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181624">
        done in general and there’s enough suspense to keep the viewer interested. The biggest problem however is the filler episodes; they were initially funny, but the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again and it becomes annoying fast. Even without talking about the recaps, some episodes were just completely unnecessary, like before each battle they have at least one episode where the characters just encourage each other and talk about the upcoming battle. <br />
<br />
 Characters: The cast seems pretty diverse, but all the characters can fit in an archetype in some way or other. They gain maturity and confidence during the battles, but it seems to revert once the battle is over, and they are back to repeating the same catchphrases again and again. Many of the jokes are based on character antics, but after 200 eps, it becomes really predicable and repetitive. Another thing that really bothers me is the female characters; even though some of them are strong, their strength is nothing compared to the male characters, they hardly participate in battles, often can’t do anything without help from the males (Chrome, cough* cough*). And while it is important to have a female character who can’t fight but serves as moral support, having two of them is way too much especially when one is portrayed as very annoying and immature. Many of the characters who don’t fight are very uninteresting; Despite tagging along for 200+ episodes and getting a lot of screentime, they don’t get character development at all. Hibari Kyouya was especially poorly written; he is some lone wolf who practically wins every battle in 1 min without effort or remarkable injuries, and he doesn’t have character growth at all. In other words, he can be easily qualified as a ‘Gary stu’. <br />
<br />
Art:  While the character designs are interesting, the art is very inconsistent. It improves through the series, but was never really detailed and every once in a while it is still possible to see poorly drawn frames without pausing the video. <br />
<br />
Sound: The osts were decent, but they get kinda annoying after being repeated 98343981 times, especially when you can easily predict when they will be played. Most of the openings and endings however were pretty good and original. The seiyus’ voices fit the characters well, but some of them may annoy you, like Haru and Lambo’s. <br />

    Oh boy, do I have a history with Reborn. I&#039;m gonna be honest; I dropped this. When I started this as a weeblet years back, I thought Reborn was a boring, generic shounen gag anime. I dropped it about 7 episodes in and didn&#039;t touch it again for almost two years. I stumbled upon Reborn again on Hulu and saw the promotional art. It looked different than the Reborn I knew years ago, so I decided to give it another chance, picked up where I left off, and I was blown away.<br />
<br />
=Story=<br />
Like I stated above, I originally dropped Reborn because the episodes I saw were

          <span style="display: none;" id="review348443">
        generic, boring gag episodes to me. And yes, the first 10 episodes or so are generic. However, they are vital to understanding the story and the characters, so you can&#039;t really skip them, unfortunately. If you can make it past the first arc, you will be rewarded very well.<br />
Reborn, despite being a Mafia anime, isn&#039;t very violent at all, and I think it works well for the show. Reborn doesn&#039;t try to be edgy and cool, it focuses on the relationship and teamwork of the characters, their hopes, worries, and why they choose to fight for the Family. Reborn is a lot more heartfelt than it seems to be, and it&#039;s very refreshing. Even though Reborn does have a few gag episodes beyond the first arc, you&#039;re hooked on the main story all the way through. It&#039;s very easy to find yourself immersed in the world of these characters, wanting to have answers as to how something works, or why something is as it is. <br />
<br />
=Characters=<br />
I. Love. Everyone. Just about every single character, whether they&#039;re a main, supporting, or even antagonist, they have at least one good trait about them. The main cast has interesting chemistry and relationships, and you&#039;re rooting for them all the way through. Yes, Tsuna is a wimp for a decent portion of the story, but it&#039;s important for his development. Even during his wimpy moments, he&#039;s still truly caring and likable and wants to become stronger for his Family and himself. The other main cast? Great. Their personalities are great, and they work with one another in a way to make for an interesting story, funny jokes, and heartfelt relationships. This show is so good with its characters, I even liked annoying cow baby in the end. Reborn easily wins my pick for the best overall characters in anime.<br />
<br />
=Sound=<br />
The OST is fire (no pun intended I swear). The character themes are epic and feel appropriate for them, and the opening themes help to hype you up for the episode. Reborn has the sort of music you&#039;d specifically search up on Youtube or Spotify; it&#039;s just that nice. The voice acting is good. The casting for the seiyuu was great, so each character has a voice that matches them well. The seiyuu also just have great performances overall.<br />
<br />
=Animation and Art=<br />
For its time, Reborn had good animation. The numerous fight scenes were well-animated and kept you interested. Basic animations were also solid. As for the art, I actually believe it improves, just like the story. At first, the art is pretty okay; it isn&#039;t bad, but not astounding. The more the anime progresses, Reborn seems to establish more of a unique style I love.<br />
<br />
=Summary=<br />
Reborn has shot its way back into my heart (okay that was pun intended). To this day, it remains an all-time favorite of mine. Would I call Reborn perfect? Heck no. In anything, perfection is just a fantasy everyone hopes to achieve. I believe to truly love an anime, or anything really, you should acknowledge its weaknesses. It&#039;s plainly obvious Reborn had a slow start, which I think sadly scared away many from watching it. If anything, I wish Reborn was way more popular and appreciated by everyone. If you could just be patient and give Reborn a chance, you&#039;ll be deathsperate for more (thus ends my terrible puns and hopefully not terrible review).

    If you want to watch something that’s striking right from the beginning, you might not like Katekyo Hitman Reborn!<br />
<br />
At least I know I did not enjoy it the first time.<br />
<br />
First episodes make absolutely no sense. Even if the characters explain what is happening, you will stare at the screen saying “is this FOR REAL? what was the author THINKING?” a LOT of times. I did, but let me tell you something: after a few episodes of comedy, weird characters and ridiculous storyline, you somehow get yourself immersed in the story. How? Keep reading.<br />
<br />
Story: Katekyo Hitman Reborn is a shonen, but it is not your typical

          <span style="display: none;" id="review334130">
        shonen. The story is certainly different from any shonen you have watched yet: a teen —who is apparently not good at anything— is chosen as the Vongola Family’s (a Mafia) Boss and a baby (who happens to be a mafioso) gets to tutor him. Our hero, Tsunayoshi Sawada, HATES everything that is part of the Mafia: the guns, the fights, the danger and is not really much of a mafioso himself: he is wimpy, lacks self-esteem and even courage. Yeah, very ridiculous. In fact, I dropped this anime three times because I couldn’t bare watching it though I regretted it as soon as the action started. The writers somehow found a way to explain everything that didn’t make sense as the story kept advancing. It gets better with each arc and so does the manga. Weapons, animal companions, flames... This anime has what you could ask for in a shonen for great battles.<br />
<br />
Characters: From the beginning, the anime is focused on introducing each character. There are a lot of characters but since the story is a bit slow paced, you get to differentiate them easily. The characters all seem to go through great character development (especially our hero -which starts from being a coward to slowly  developed courage and great resolve-), each of them have theme songs that play when they appear on the screen, each of them is different and strong in their way. There is really a variety of characters, they are colorful, their personalities are well defined and they act accordingly. I guess that one of the most remarkable things about this anime is how well the characters are written and thought of.<br />
<br />
Music/Sound: As I mentioned above, throughout the anime, each character had their theme song (for example, whenever Hibari entered the room or met Tsuna, a theme  song would play or sometimes when Tsuna got into his Hyper Dying Will Mode a theme song would also play) which honestly, I thought was pretty cool. The openings, in my opinion, sound like typical shonen songs so I loved them and so happened with the endings. I don’t think there was a single bad or unfitting song in this anime, all of them according to every moment and character.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation: From the start, the animation was one of the most average things about this anime. I didn’t like it. I don’t know how but without noticing (really, I didn’t notice) the animation got pretty good. Even if some fights, due to their nature, are “dark”, the animation remains colorful and that’s one of the things that I definitely liked about the animation.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: If you like comedy and you don’t watch it with a critical eye, you will certainly enjoy this anime right from the beginning. If you are looking at something serious, you might get bored (as I did). This is definitely an anime that to truly enjoy it, you have to sit back and stop trying to understand it.<br />
<br />
Overall: Katekyo Hitman Reborn! has been my favorite anime for a while, I wouldn’t say it is the best anime I have watched but there is something about how I fell for the characters, the music, the fights, the arcs... It was all put down together and it gave me some laughs aside from a few tears it got from me. This anime isn’t a 10 (especially by how slow paced it gets between arcs = fillers), but it is one of the best shounen there is.<br />
<br />
I am sure that if you decide to give this anime an opportunity, you won’t regret watching it.

    Despite having intriguing moments, great climatic shōnen battles, amazing cast of characters and quite the interesting plot, it&#039;s still a hidden gem and is definitely one of those anime that deserves way more attention (although the series is still popular in Japan to my knowledge but I digress). <br />
<br />
One of my favorite aspects about the series is how the story takes it&#039;s time to flow, of course this does happen commonly in most anime in my past experience, most of them however often get to the point rather quickly, but with Reborn! it does take way too much time throughout the course of it&#039;s first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409395">
        20 episodes. There are plenty of action scenes like explosions, boxing match, running around with nothing but boxers but above all these elements what really captured my interest is how peaceful and comedic it is.<br />
<br />
I while admit though: Just because I enjoyed it, doesn&#039;t always mean other people will do and that&#039;s acceptable. The Daily Life Arc does not sit well with other people as much as I adored it.<br />
<br />
Now for the character designs:<br />
<br />
While it may not compare to Akira Amano&#039;s manga art style, I still think the anime art style were pretty solid (imo) it was drawn by Masayoshi Tanaka, the same designer who designed characters from animes like Toradora, Your Name, Anohana and High School of the Dead. Still, not as good as Amano-sensei, but it was still pretty solid for me, I also love how it drastically grows the more you watch.<br />
<br />
Speaking of characters, the series also has a huge step up in terms of character development progression, there are plenty of them to go for, plus, I believe most of them are well received for the most part, but I&#039;m going to go for the one that the series constantly sets the main focus on (and the one that people seem to hate the most) which is the main protagonist Tsuna, I think a lot of people would disagree but try to hear me out:<br />
<br />
Most people would often say that his character evolution is VERY slow and gradual, that it takes like 203 episodes in anime form and 300 chapters in the manga form in order for him to actually become brave (which btw it&#039;s only in the last arc and the anime didn&#039;t even adapt it).<br />
<br />
I believe his character development technically started from episode 2 of the anime; it was during the volleyball match when Tsuna saw that all of his volleyball teammates were trying so hard to win the match even despite them being injured. Rather than running away like he does in the first episode/chapter, He actually decided to give a genuine effort without relying on the dying will bullet from Reborn. <br />
<br />
Throughout the entire series, Tsuna wants almost nothing to do with the mafia in general, mostly because he disagrees with the violent history of the organization, he does his best to live a normal life with every chance he can get, compare this to most shōnen protagonist at the time and even now such as: (Izuku Midoriya, Naruto and Luffy) whom three of them had set of specific goals that they are determined to reach and are willing to fight for that said goal through whatever means.<br />
<br />
In contrast, Tsuna is actually a pacifist, like he is a merciful person who always worries about the safety of others including the inner turmoil of his opponents even more then his own safety. His level of empathy may actually fuel his determination which is why he gets stronger and stronger, not to mention that he actually threatens his foes first and if they didn&#039;t comply then he will take action (example would be his fight with Byakuran).<br />
<br />
Overall, There are so many things I loved about the anime, but i&#039;m just going to make it partial,  If you enjoy traditional 2000s classic shōnen action anime, Katekyo Hitman Reborn might be worth picking up - Sure you could debate if it legitimately holds up all you want when compared to other shōnen that are mainstream nowadays like Attack On Titan, Promised Neverland, Jujutsu Kaisen and My Hero Academia etc. But:<br />
<br />
1)- While it may not appeal to modern audiences, Katekyo Hitman Reborn is a 2006 anime so they should be aware of how decades old the anime is (despite somewhat being ahead of its time)<br />
<br />
2)- Being a fan of the series since 2012, I can come clean and say that it has its flaws but I still enjoyed for what it is, although I can admit while there are a couple of shōnen anime (mostly the ones that are beloved and popular) are universally praised, I have to say.. I think I like Katekyo Hitman Reborn more, it is a weird spot to be in but it just so happens, there is something unique about it...<br />
<br />
All that said, I&#039;m hoping for the anime to return in this generation and should adapt the rest of the unanimated arcs or a reboot.<br />
<br />

    Katekyoshi Hitman Reborn! is an excellent example of how intriguing shounen manga can be with the right mixture of comedy, action, suspense and the flawless integration of the mafia and fantasy themes. The main protagonist Tsuna, at first glance, seems to have a defeatist attitude and comes off as pathetic, failing about everything, his studies, sports and even romance. Then our reluctant hero meets a mysterious infant hitman called Reborn who is recuited to be Tsuna&#039;s tutor because Tsuna is the 10th boss of the Vongola Family, a powerful and influential mafia family to much to Tsuna&#039;s dismay!<br />

          <span style="display: none;" id="review26274">
        have come across in a while with the plot initially having large amounts of comedy and stupidity but goes on to include much darker themes later on. The anime starts of slowly introducing each character and establishing the bonds between them. It then goes on to have one the best concepts and plot I have come across. The plot was fairly consistent with the action and comedy sequences that keep the audience entertained and with just the right amount suspense, leaving the audience eager for the next episode.  There are well thought out powers and weaponry that Tsuna and his guardians use to face challenges and save the day proving that though the mafia may be considered criminal syndicates but the Vongola are different.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art is excellent and the hero looks extremely cool while defeating villains. The equipment and weapons, pets, clothing and characters are well planned, well drawn and unique. I especially loved the Vongola Coat of Arms and Tsuna drawn in Hyper Dying Will Mode. Unlike most shounen manga, The character&#039;s clothing changes which is a fact that I love! Even the irritating underwear scene had him don a different pair each time...Though he does have the tyipcal shounen hero&#039;s orange color scheme, a popular trend with shonen manga.  (I refer to Naurto and Goku&#039;s clothing and Ichigo&#039;s hair)<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The openings and the endings were quite good. I failed to notice any character specific battle music which is a change from normal anime which has music for each character. Tthe music is subtle and suitable to the situation and does not overwhelm the senses and distract. Tsuna&#039;s seiyu does an excellent job and Tsuna&#039;s voice in HDWM is slightly more mature than normal.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
The characters are well developed and realistic and the hero forms a buffer between egos that may otherwise clash, a valuble leadership skill. Tsuna dislikes vilence but once provoked is a deadly force top be reckoned with. Gokudera with his Zeal, Yamamoto and his calm and laid back nature, Ryohei and his Passionate, Kyoya with his Aflooness, Lambo and  his Cowardice and Mukuro and his claim to have a personal agenda is understood and is held together by Tsuna who forms the &quot;glue&quot; that holds his guardians together.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Negative points:<br />
I have enjoyed every episode. Though there were things that annoyed me. <br />
1. Tha actual plot starts after 20 episodes. <br />
2.The lead is irritating for the first 20 episodes with his dying will underwear scenes! I must say it was extremely funny but watching the same sequence for over 20 episodes makes you annoyed at Tsuna! I do not understand the point of it. Tsuna goes on to nbecoming super cool later on. <br />
3. The Recap and Omake sections take up too much of the episodes time not to mention recap episodes!!<br />
Despite this, the story arcs are well connected and the balance between action and comedy well maintained. <br />
<br />
<br />
I strongly recommend this series to shounen fans!! I give this series a 9/10 and inspite of the drawbacks, it was excellent and entertaining. The plot, characters and art are strong points!<br />
<br />

    I have nothing bad to say about this anime.  This is literally by *far* the best anime I have watched yet, being so ahead of its time.  The character design for Tsuna and the antagonists are great and... well was ahead of its time.  This is most underrated shounen I have ever watched yet and I&#039;m about to tell you why.<br />
<br />
First let&#039;s talk about the audience, actually.  Literally any age audience can watch this and still enjoy it.  The extreme lack in perverted moments make this anime suitable for audiences under the ages of 16.  There is mature and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404748">
        harsh language but there is never any vulgar language, such as sex jokes, explicit swearing and in my opinion is really good for those who want to watch a clean, amazing anime. I could even let my 8 year old brother watch it in my religious household on our large screen TV and even my parents would enjoy it.  The content and subject matter, although, is complicated and may be harder for children ages under 12 to understand so that itself would bring the age rating back up to PG-13.  There are no insanely gorey scenes so that brings down the restrictions to 13+.  Anyways, in my opinion, having a large audience capability makes an anime really good and I think that these features make this anime perfect for the ages 13 and above and even those older than 18 would still enjoy the content and plot this story provides us with.<br />
<br />
Now, on to the storyline and plot writing.  The first few episodes seem to push a lot of people away because they *seem* like filler episodes, but that&#039;s just half the truth.  I would say that 80% of the filler episodes is just pure filler while the 20% is actually information you need that is crucial to the story, being a 100+ episode anime.  The great thing about the fillers is that they aren&#039;t long, boring and dragged out tediously, rather they&#039;re more of our comedy break times.  Nevertheless, theyre still worth watching especially if you like a bit of comedy.  Throughout the series, though, you will get good comedy. As for the plot, the beginning arc may make the anime seem like a lame show with inferior storyline but I&#039;m going to tell you right now that the story really advances later on to a reasonable rate.  Our main protag learns very quickly because of his charisma and excellent motor skills so his character development comes along well throughout the show.  He is the most typical shounen character but he still manages to capture my heart because of his character development in this show.<br />
<br />
As for character writing, I would say that most of the characters&#039; personalities remain stagnant throughout the series but that isn&#039;t always a bad thing because there are many positive effects to the plot from their character writing, if that makes sense. The only character we dwelve the deepest into would be Tsuna, some of the villains and *some* of his friends, but I wouldn&#039;t put too much expectations in understanding characters more because they aren&#039;t written *too* too deeply but written so that you can still lightly emotionally connect and feel character development.<br />
<br />
Overall, this anime is just a straight up 10/10 for me and for people like me who enjoy watching a time-worthy anime with the fam.

    When i first came across KHR, it was a toss up against Gintama.  I watched the first episode of KHR and was put off by Tsuna&#039;s underwear mode thing, thinking it was completely ridiculous and stupid.  So then i chose to watch Gintama instead, however, i&#039;m SO glad that i did come back to KHR eventually, or else i would have missed out on such an AMAZING anime.  After episode 20 or so, i found myself completely hooked, i probably even loved the underwear mode by then.<br />
<br />
Story - 9/10<br />
Once the real storyline kicks off, KHR turns into something amazing and unique. 

          <span style="display: none;" id="review17191">
        At first glance, the mafia based story put together with superhuman babies may seem a disaster but the plot eventually becomes something far from that and everything just seems to fit into place.  The only reason why i would not give it a full 10/10 is because (as mentioned before) it takes a long time for the real storyline to kick in, but if you pull through the first 20 episodes, you&#039;ll definitely find yourself addicted and watching episode after episode.  On top of that, KHR has considerably less fillers than other shounen anime.<br />
<br />
Art - 8/10<br />
The anime begins with bad character art, but as it goes on, the way the characters are drawn do get better.  The action scenes were well done to begin with IMO, and they also get even better further into the anime :]. I particularly liked the clothing style of some characters *cough* Gokudera *cough*, scenery wasn&#039;t bad although i didn&#039;t pay much attention to that, but at least houses looked like houses and trees looked like trees. x]<br />
<br />
Sound - 9/10<br />
I loved nearly all the OP and ED themes, they fit the anime really well and got me addicted to Cherryblossom and Masami Mitsuoka&#039;s voice.  The character&#039;s voices fit perfectly and were very unique, although Haru&#039;s voice tended to be quite annoying at times with her &quot;dangerous desu!&quot; thing.<br />
<br />
Characters - 10/10<br />
I loved all the characters by the time they were all introduced, they all have unique personalities and the amount of support and loyalty they give the protagonist is almost heartwarming.  Each character has something unique to them which stands out from the rest of the people Tsuna knows, whether it be a saying or a style, there isn&#039;t any two characters who are similar really (unless you count fringe characters...)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 9/10<br />
By the time i reached episode 40 or so, i found myself watching it non stop, struggling to slow down so i don&#039;t catch up so fast.  It became one of my top favourite anime by that point, i usually don&#039;t judge anime before i finish them/catch up, but this one became an exception by miles.  Once you reach the real storyline you&#039;ll be completely hooked wanting to know what happens next.<br />
<br />
Overall - 10/10<br />
Despite it&#039;s flaws at the beginning (taking too long to start, fairly bad animation etc), for me, KHR makes up for it all with its awesome storyline and unique characterisation whilst keeping typical shounen elements for it to be categorised in this area.  I&#039;d recommend it to anyone who is looking for a long running shounen anime without having to sift through 50+ episodes to reach the real plot.  KHR is definitely an addictive anime worth watching, you&#039;ll find yourself waiting for the new episodes to be subbed before you know it. :]<br />

    Since Reborn! aired a while back, I doubt anyone will look at this review, but I shall write it anyway. I watched this the beginning of this year, but I never got the guts to submit a review, he he. ;&#039;)<br />
Here we have Sawada Tsunayoshi, a middle school student, who by not much luck, is nicknamed &#039;Loser Tsuna&#039; by all his classmates, assumed to be a failure due to the fact that he&#039;s not good at anything. Now, all that may change when he meets the obscure, mafia hitman, Reborn!<br />
WARNING: THE FIRST 20 EPISODES WILL MAKE YOU WANT TO DROP THE SHOW, BUT DON&#039;T, JUST

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201938">
        DON&#039;T.<br />
Story: 8<br />
There have been many Mafia animes, and still some are coming up, but what I liked about Reborn! was that it puts its own twist on things. The first 20 episodes are basically like &#039;daily life&#039; episodes and may make you want to drop it, but don&#039;t. I promise you you&#039;ll regret it. I dropped it after the first 13 episodes until my brother told me &quot;Don&#039;t drop it, it&#039;ll get so good after so don&#039;t drop it.&quot; And I&#039;m glad I continued to watch it. After the first 20 episodes you&#039;ll get an action-packed, adventured filled, expedition, I promise you.<br />
Art: 7<br />
Because this is a slightly old shounen, it wasn&#039;t in HD when it aired, and the art style was past decent but it wasn&#039;t fantastic if you understand what I&#039;m getting at. It does later on get way better quality, so I wouldn&#039;t worry very much about the art.<br />
Sound: 10<br />
Aside from the story line, this is where Reborn! DOMINATES. The openings and endings are some of my all time favorite songs. You will not be disappointed at all with the soundtrack. The sounds with the fights and the voices are all very good quality too.<br />
Character: 9<br />
The character development here, in my opinion, was fantastic! But i can&#039;t say how without giving out spoilers so, I&#039;m sorry. Just take my word for it.<br />
Enjoyment:10<br />
It&#039;s a really funny series to watch, I fell off my bed once to how much I laughed and I cried when I got to the end of this series. Not because of the ending itself simply because you get so attached to the characters, you just love them. I wanted more, but I never got it. *tear*<br />
(I feel like overall and enjoyment are like the same fricking thing, but whatever ;&#039;) )<br />
Overall: 10<br />
Overall, Katekyo Hitman Reborn! was a rollercoaster of an anime that I will never forget. Just give it a shot. Its 203 episodes worth watching. Don&#039;t overlook it if you ever come across it. When I got the average of my scores, it was a 9, but I added the extra point because I just loved this serious too much to not call it a masterpiece.

    When I started watching the show the episodes were funny at first, but it got repetitive pretty fast after the main characters were introduced. The story and the character development slows down and the episodes are the same thing over and over again. (could be filler though)<br />
I even dropped the anime for a while. But I kept reading stories about how it gets better in later episodes, and it did!<br />
<br />
Hitman Reborn is a pretty unique anime in my opinion. There is one major flaw in the story that prevents me from giving it a full 10. The first 20 episodes or so have no real

        story arc. While each episode is interesting and helps develop the characters it takes way too long for the story to truly begin.

    Okay, I feel like this review is going short and sweet but straight to the point. I decided to pick this up since my friend was going on about this like he does with One Piece. So I decided to give it a shot. The first 20 episodes are a real killer, since that&#039;s were a lot of people are like &quot;okay... what is this? Can we get to some sort of story/action already?!&quot; It has its little humor here and there to keep a little smile on your face.<br />
<br />
However, for me at least, I did not get interested in until the future arc. That&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31857">
        practically more than halfway through the series. There were a FEW decent fights here and there before than but nothing too captivating. I guess what really had me was that they consistently dragged some parts out. It&#039;s noticeable in every arc and because of that, I had to put this series on hold and start a new series just so I could have my &quot;anime fill&quot; for the day. Sure there are plenty of anime that does this, but Hitman was really bad with this.<br />
<br />
This show loves to put fillers within the arc and loves to have recap episodes and tries to play it off like it&#039;s really part of the story (though it&#039;s not as bad as Naruto). So occasionally, I would say something similar to this, &quot;Really, that was an episode? C&#039;mon it should be better than this.&quot; Of course other anime do similar things, but with Hitman just really irked me the most. You will know which episodes will be recaps and you can skip them if you so choose to. For me, I have to watch every single episode, special, ova, movie and etc of a series.<br />
<br />
So as my first review comes to an end, let me just answer a few more things: <br />
<br />
Is this one of the best anime series that I have watched to date? - definitely not<br />
Is this worth a re-watch? - only less than a handful of episodes so basically no<br />
Would I recommend this to people looking for a new series? - nope<br />
Would I recommend this to people looking to kill some time? - maybe<br />
Could you take a pass on this anime? - yeah, you are not really missing anything<br />
<br />
However if you are interested in Hitman Reborn, I would have to say that, stick with the manga, the anime definitely does not do this series justice unfortunately. Though a few OP/ED&#039;s were pretty decent :-)<br />
<br />
Not trying to bash the series out there for those out there who likes/loves it, but I&#039;m just obviously voicing my opinion on how I felt about this series. It&#039;s definitely not the best nor the worst anime I have watched. I&#039;m just sort of disappointed that my friend hyped it up as much as he does with One Piece, so I probably was expecting too much from this. Hmm... what do you know, my review wasn&#039;t all that short lol.

    Now this anime is one i don&#039;t think i will ever understand the fascination with. I have reached ep 65 so its not a complete review, but how many eps should it take for an anime to get good? Considering how  popular this show is, i think its time to balance it out with a negative review.<br />
<br />
Ok, its pretty well established in the anime community that the first 19 eps or so are garbage.<br />
<br />
But they are not garbage because they have no story and a basically filler episodes. They are garbage because some of the characters are so annoying they want to make you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29410">
        pull your eyes out. The cow and egg baby are horrid and the main character, tsuna, his japanese voice acting is more annoying then shinjis dub voice from evangelion. These eps are so bad they make naruto filler eps 136-220 look good!  :(<br />
<br />
Ok, now thats out the way, to the real review.<br />
<br />
Most people are like watch from ep 20 where the first story arc is. However that too is a let down with boring, short and badly constructed fights. Its also just bog standard shonen fare that you have seen a million times before in high school fighting shows. Then after this short arc...more horrible filler.<br />
<br />
To be fair, the second arc is ALOT BETTER, and i would recommend just watching as much of the beginning as you can cope with, and then jumping to ep 34. <br />
<br />
The fights are alot better, story picks up and becomes a more solid shonen fighting show.<br />
<br />
However it still in no way matches the hype. In NO WAY, can this show even come close to Naruto, One Piece, Dragon ball or even Bleach.<br />
<br />
The fights so far are no where near as good as the above shows. Storyline wise its ok, better then bleach and dragonball but no match for naruto and especially  one piece.<br />
<br />
However its lack of emotion, character development and drama seals its fate. Because the start is so bad i feel nothing for any of the characters and the main character kills the show dead. He has to be the worst main character ever. <br />
<br />
Even Bleach has better character building and emotion then this and Bleach sucks in that area. <br />
<br />
I know there are alot of people who hate the Naruto anime, and thats fine. But if any of those ppl like Reborn then i honestly think they are not using any logic. Naruto CRUSHES Reborn with ease. Narutos fights, story, characters and especially emotional scenes  destroy the first 65 eps of Reborn.<br />
<br />
And to compare Reborn to the king of the shonen fighting animes, One Piece, is like comparing The Empire Strikes Back  with Attack of the Clones.<br />
<br />
I know its possible that Reborn goes super after the Varia arc but how many eps can an anime stay mediocre?<br />
<br />
 Even Bleach got good from ep 15, Naruto was good from ep 1 and went thunderous after ep 19. Naruto Shippuuden is wasting some of the potential the show had but is still fabulous. Dragonball was great from the off, Dragonball z started with one awesome fight and One Pieces first season is still prob the 2nd or 3rd best one piece season with amazing character development.<br />
<br />
For reborn to start off with filler is crazy and even the varia arc is not up to par. <br />
<br />
Reborn might have been the 5th legendary long running shonen fighting anime, but alas it was not to be.<br />
<br />
