    As I&#039;ve finished this anime, I can&#039;t help but notice that only 7 (not including me), have made a review of this anime 4 of them gave it a low score, one gave an ehhhhhhh kind of score and only 2 gave it a high rating. But ya know I kinda agree with Graylia when she/he said that this anime is &quot;Stereotypical anime that tries too hard to be dark/edgy and then fails on all fronts. Lackluster plot, characters, everything. Relies on semi-nudity and shock factor to make up for poorly written plot. Disappointing.&quot; which is obvious since there isn&#039;t a lot who made a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282558">
        review of this thing. Then again, this anime as a whole does present itself a certain level of uniqueness, that we don&#039;t often see a lot except in a hentai anime like Amai Chobatsu, there the main character is stupid, while here, the characters were victims of the&#039;re own pride, perversions, foolishness, negligence  and greed, so Ok the Slave Control Method or (SCM) was originally design to be used on pets so that they&#039;ll be more obedient to their masters, but as we see such device can be used for one&#039;s perversion just as the main protagonist Setagaya Tsubaki were he is that total package for greed and perversion, where I&#039;m glad that he got owned by Minato Takio and then he got owned by Eia and now has to faced some payback from the Yakuza boss Nerima Mouo. Now the character category , Eia Arakawq may have been the main protagonist here, given that he gets to own everybody and frees them at once , but in this anime every character here get&#039;s to have their own story, were it wasn&#039;t on Eia alone, the thing about this anime was that it&#039;s geared up to the characters backstory as to the kind of life they lived and how some tragedies has impacted them and how such cruel device like the SCM has change their lives from having such grandeur of being the master to being a slave , so there isn&#039;t any point at all to say that this anime was for Eia at all, though I&#039;m disgusted that even the dog would have its own backstory , but nevertheless it provided the backstory of how the SCM came to be. When it come to the art, I&#039;m pretty sure that them hound were having a field day when they saw them girls in their underwear in the last episode. So how do I rate this? Here&#039;s how:<br />
<br />
Story-Very Good 8: since it has its own uniqueness were see the side of the character through their backstory and how the SCM has change their lives from being master to becoming salves due to their own negligence, pride, greed, lust, anger and perversions.<br />
<br />
Art- Good 7: Since it doesn&#039;t feature any quintessential, school uniform , but there were some fanservices around here for the hounds to howl for.<br />
<br />
Sound-Fair 6: I don&#039;t know, I just rate for the heck of it. <br />
<br />
Character- Very good 8: Since the mainchacter Eia Arakawa may have been the one to save the day , she cannot be considered as the protagonist , cu&#039;z each episode put the characters to be the protagonist or the antagonist. At one point Ryuuno is the antagonist were we wanna see getting his ass whooped to  the eyepatch girl who from this yandere bitch become a slave from one master to the next. which is good since the main antagonist Sategaya becomes Minato&#039;s salve despite of having the Judgment SCM and then Minato get&#039;s own and then is now a deadman, for what he did.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- Very Good 8: Seeing how good Eia is is what kept me guled to this anime. <br />
<br />
Overall- Very Good 8: Well each has their own anime that they like, so to me I like this, it might not be perfect it might have some plot holes in it, but to me it&#039;s ok...So to each his own.

    I want to start by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. I enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons, but that doesn&#039;t change the fact that I derived pleasure from its existence. This anime is a hot, steamy witch&#039;s brew of plot holes, contrivances, and WAY TOO MANY CHARACTERS.<br />
<br />
The story is about people engaging in high-stakes games where the loser is psychologically compelled to become the winner&#039;s slave. However, the narrative is too disjointed and forced to deliver on any of the tension or intrigue. Instead, it&#039;s a sea of constantly changing power dynamics, coincidences, and weird sex stuff. <br />
<br />
The only way I would

          <span style="display: none;" id="review286124">
        honestly recommend this show to someone (based on its own merits, and not on so-bad-it&#039;s-good voyeurism) is if someone is looking for a light BDSM romp. MAL currently doesn&#039;t list this as ecchi, but the master-slave dynamic is definitely taken to its logical conclusion. If that&#039;s your thing, then I&#039;m glad you&#039;ve finally found something to scratch that itch. <br />
<br />
Anyways, the story is too all over the place to be anything other than an increasing amount of absurdities that dogpile onto each other like a drunken, disorganized orgy until some sort of climax is reached and everyone heads home without making eye contact. 2/10<br />
<br />
The animation is...something else, that&#039;s for sure. Characters are off-model as often as they are on-model. I genuinely couldn&#039;t tell you what some characters&#039; hairstyles are supposed to be, because the second they start moving, it dissolves into mush. The dog is a particularly fine example of the animation team being incompetent and lazy. Like, most of the time they weren&#039;t even trying. Add in the bland color pallet and awkward facial expressions, and there are no good visuals to be found. 3/10<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is passable. It was never standout, but neither was it stand in the way. It&#039;s bare competency stands in stark contrast to the rest of the production. 6/10<br />
<br />
The anime&#039;s biggest flaw is its characters. That&#039;s not to say there are no good characters, as a few of them have interesting motives and backgrounds. However, the cast is so crowded that none of them are given enough screen time to really develop. You could have still had a complex, high-stakes game with a lot of players if you cut the cast in half. As it is, you aren&#039;t given enough time to get attached to any of them. Except the dog. The dog is a fucking rockstar (more on him later). 4/10<br />
<br />
When all is said and done, there were several occasions that I laughed out loud at the sheer ridiculousness of what was happening onscreen. It has the feel of an old-school anime, with its wacky plot that is going to take itself deadly serious no matter how zany things get. If you bother paying attention, the plot holes are so face-palming delightful. In no particular order, here are some of the gems from this series (SPOILERS):<br />
<br />
-If the little shota wanted to free his mother so bad, why didn&#039;t he just trick the head gangster into a battle with the slave device? Like he&#039;s passing the gadgets out like candy to his underlings, even though these things are millions of yen and he&#039;s trying to save up enough money to free his mom.<br />
<br />
-We are supposed to believe that this device that can force the loser of a contest to become a slave was originally developed...to help train pets. Yup. If Fido&#039;s having some trouble being housebroken, just challenge him to a contest to make him SUBMIT TO YOUR WILL. Especially since the explanation we are given for how the device controls the wearer is by inflicting them with a crushing since of responsibility. Because we all know our pets are emotionally complex and bound by duty and societal expectations. <br />
<br />
-The self-described crazy lady has apparently never heard of Craigslist&#039;s missed connections. The entire reason she&#039;s doing all this is...to reconnect with a one-night stand. You DO know that private eye&#039;s exist, right? That there are other, better ways to track someone down than to wonder around town betting your free-will and collecting slaves. <br />
<br />
-THE DOG. THE DOG IS SOMEHOW THE SMARTEST CHARACTER. Like not only is he able to understand humans completely, he grasps the nuance of the situation and the life-or-death battles. And like...no one finds that weird. They all just take it for granted that the you can explain the rules of the game to him and he&#039;ll bark in agreement and go to town. &quot;Hey dog, first person to omnomnom this flatware WINS.&quot; &quot;ARF!&quot; Does this take place in an alternate universe where dogs are super intelligent? Is that why the SCM was designed as a dog-training device? <br />
<br />
So when all is said and done, Dorei-ku provided a decent amount of enjoyment (6/10). However, even on the grounds of so-bad-it&#039;s-good, there are better shows out there you could watch if you want to laugh at some bad anime. Additionally, I honestly couldn&#039;t tell you how this show stacks up when it comes to BDSM fan-service, as that&#039;s not my area of expertise. Overall, I&#039;d give this show a 4/10, and tell people to give it a pass.<br />
<br />
But that dog, man. That dog is my hero.

    Dorei-ku The Animation is what happens when Death Note and a softcore ecchi anime tried to get serious only for them to get drunk AND stoned in the process and then didn&#039;t give a shit to the offspring they created...<br />
<br />
LA had a morbid curiosity in watching Dorei-ku The Animation and LA&#039;s curiosity bit LA in the hand if the intro statement is anything to go by. See Dorei-ku The Animation tries to mix in the mind games of Death Note&#039;s Light and L with risque and ecchi consequences for the loser however with what Dorei-ku The Animation tries and fails to do in terms of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282476">
        the mind games is the stakes it implements to the huge cast of characters not only bloat the mind games as a whole but makes the stakes almost WORTHLESS by the end of it all.<br />
<br />
Dorei-ku The Animation&#039;s plot is of some &quot;magical braces&quot; where if you duel someone with another kind of the same braces and you win in a game and you mutually agree to it, the loser turns in the slave of the winner being the owner of that slave, as it&#039;s base, it&#039;s fine and somewhat interesting, but the bigger picture on the other hand is a different beast altogether. <br />
<br />
See Dorei-ku The Animation is a character-focused anime changing heads almost EVERY episode and though LA doesn&#039;t mind character development because at least we CAN try and get invested in some of these characters, Dorei-ku The Animation&#039;s major flaw in all this is by the simple fact that though we do get their backstory and maybe some character development to how they got into the SCM (Slave Control Method) business in the first place, in terms of the bigger picture, if your NOT one of the main characters like Eiya Arakawa voiced by Hibiku Yamamura and Ryuuou Edogawa voiced by Asuna Tomari by the more serious plotline, the rest of the cast MEANS nothing and hardly develop AT ALL. Let&#039;s not even get the situation where characters just arrive out of nowhere and hijack the plot on MULTIPLE occasions almost like the anime is stalling ever chance it gets and again due to the nature of Dorei-ku The Animation, we get backstories on them too, but it&#039;s kinda the entire &quot;your too late to the party...who the hell are you?&quot; kinda situation and the thing is, one of the actual main villains in this anime was one of the researchers of the SCM and guess what THIS exact things happens to him...a MAJOR VILLAIN gets his own anime hijacked by a LESSER villain...like what the fuck?<br />
<br />
Ohh what else?, ohh yeah how this anime seems to break LA&#039;s suspension of disbelief when it comes to not only how coincidental Dorei-ku The Animation is as a whole but how batshit crazy it gets to the point LA can&#039;t believe it. Ohh how about the fact that a freakin&#039; DOG is part of the SCM situation and though he can only bark, he has a inner monologue!!!...thinks that&#039;s crazy, how about the fact that one of the characters have a split personality...with his deceased mother through the connection of his SCM...like WHAT THE FUCK?!?!!?. There&#039;s suspension of disbelief then there&#039;s LA jumping off it because of how ludicrous this anime gets and NOT in the good way.<br />
<br />
Ok back on track, so again because of the anime really doesn&#039;t care about ANY of it&#039;s character besides those with the most importance of the anime which is like 3 or 4 characters including the main villains, LA just feels like the character development that Dorei-ku The Animation goes through with ALL it&#039;s cast members becomes moot once they become slaves and they naturally due to the huge cast of characters they tend to blend in together even to how exotic some of the character act or look and mind you this is TRYING to be a character-focused anime with mind games and Dorei-ku The Animation utterly failing in trying to incorporate it&#039;s characters and utterly ignoring them or doesn&#039;t know what the hell they do with them once they become slaves and them getting traded like Yu-Gi-Oh cards because of the rules of SCM in place. <br />
<br />
Sure Eiya and Ryuuou gets development all things considered from Eiya trying to stop the SCM business all together and is probably the ONLY pure character in this anime and Ryuuou having his own motivations in getting money...from people who are in debt as well (good going there dumbass) but because of how bloated the cast is and how little screentime Eiya and Ryuuou really get in this anime, Their development is only surface level and COULD have been better but again Dorei-ku The Animation rather stalled than give Eiya and Ryuuou more development at the very least, this especially how Dorei-ku The Animation doesn&#039;t care about it&#039;s characters once they become slaves and all.<br />
<br />
Oh and with the softcore ecchi stuff LA said above, yes Dorei-ku The Animation really likes the fetishizing it&#039;s characters ALOT through it&#039;s entire screentime and this is for both it&#039;s male and female characters which leads to mostly stupidly fanservice moments to utterly fan-disservice at times as to how extreme they take the fetish to. This is TNK, LA was expecting it but still that doesn&#039;t give the excuse of soo much fetishize fanservice it&#039;s become blatantly obvious.<br />
<br />
Dorei-ku The Animation&#039;s animation by TNK and Zero-G, well the animation is meh at best...crap at worst. LA isn&#039;t puling any punches as TNK and Zero-G did a horrible job in terms of animation, though Dorei-ku The Animation&#039;s character designs are decent enough the quality of even the simple facial expressions are janky any chance it gets, the backgrounding is meh and the animation just in general is janky at best and this happens throughout the anime, from simple running to facial motions and emotions are all janky as hell. TNK and Zero-G did what they could and all LA can say is.......janky.<br />
<br />
Voice acting, well due to the nature of Dorei-ku The Animation itself, well LA just didn&#039;t really care about the voice cast much like it&#039;s characters in general, though the only thing LA will say about the voice cast was that LA thought Ryuuou&#039;s voice actor was Rie Kugimiya NOT Asuna Tomori (they had VERY similar vocal tones thus the confusion). Dorei-ku The Animation&#039;s voice cast much like it&#039;s characters were non-existent and really not much too talk about.<br />
<br />
Dorei-ku The Animation just needed to freakin&#039; breathe and use it&#039;s base concept of the SCM and it&#039;s core and interesting characters of Eiya and Ryuuou and build on them instead on focusing on characters that becomes moot by their introductory episode!. But, Dorei-ku The Animation was still a trainwreck to say the least, from it&#039;s messy and haphazard plot for shock value and TRYING to be complicated when it really wasn&#039;t, characters being worthless even if they get development on their introductory episodes and characters that do have importance gets shoved to the side until the finale, crap animation with a meh voice cast...Dorei-ku The Animation quite honestly deserves LA&#039;s worst anime of Spring 2018.

    Heads up, I haven’t read the manga and I don’t plan to.<br />
<br />
Tl;dr: Could have been an edgy entertaining, smart 200 IQ 4D chess plays with mind games thriller anime, but it failed. It’s shit and I don’t recommend it. <br />
<br />
Now, let’s go to the meat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art (animation, character design, background):<br />
<br />
-Animation: 5/10 (Average)<br />
There isn’t too much to talk about it, the theme doesn’t allow heavy action each episode so you can’t expect fluid animation, but hey, Death Note got amazing animation for key moments, why this didn’t? Sometimes character would look off model so that’s a sign of bad quality. <br />
<br />
-Character design: 5/10 (Average)<br />
Just as the last

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282248">
        point it’s hard to rate this kind of thing because I bet the author wanted characters that felt and looked real, modern, urban. But I can deny that some of them are just boring at glance, most of them look plain and their personality it’s as plain as their design. <br />
<br />
-Background: 7/10 (Good)<br />
There is a good amount of bgs on this, and most of them are actually pretty nice. It’s a shame that they don’t go further from your casual visual novel bg, the kind of bg that the characters don’t really interact with. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound (Music, SFX):<br />
<br />
-Music: 5/10 (Average)<br />
There isn’t a song that I can remember from this show. Nothing is remarkable either.<br />
<br />
-SFX: 6/10 (Fine)<br />
The sounds for the SCM and the duels are fairly ok, it’s more remarkable that the music I can tell you that. Other than that, they use the same pack of sounds that your average anime uses.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story (Characters, plot, pacing):<br />
<br />
-Characters: 3/10 (Very bad)<br />
Aside for the fact that they are boring, my big problem with the characters is that most of them, I think more than half of them, just became extras for the last 6 episodes. These characters have 0 dialog lines past the fourth or fifth episode. Do you remember Seiya? I don’t. They introduce more characters that really don’t add anything they just become numbers, pieces of a collection. But the worst part is that most of them become dumb while in duels so they obviously lose. Why try to crate smart characters to have intense duels trying to outplay their rival when you can just create a simple version with dumb people?<br />
<br />
-Plot: 3/10 (Very bad)<br />
This point isn’t spoiler free, so just go to the pacing if you don’t want spoilers.<br />
<br />
I mean, I bet the author felt clever making the dog a player in his sick game, but hey, anything for being original amaright? <br />
<br />
Any ways, the concept of the SCM it’s kind of ok, it’s stupid that your victim needs to be using one for it to work, because I bet irl no one would fucking put anything in his/her mouth just because some fool want you to play a game. (Google “Watch ya´ mouth”) well, maybe I’m wrong. <br />
<br />
In the same line, what happens if someone just refuses to accept the duel? I don’t remember if they gave an answer to this or not, but let’s say that if you don’t accept it you just lose. Then what happens if you want to accept but only if you put some new rules or change the duel so it’s more in your favor? Do you get where am I going with this? The show could have some cool inner monologues for the characters trying to decipher the trick of the duel and coming up with a more favorable challenge or at least a twist on the rules of the rival. The first episodes feel good in the duels even with them being simple and easy to follow, but you would expect for them to become more complex, spoiler, they don’t. In fact, the duels don’t matter anymore, they are just a transaction now: “I challenge you… you just lost”. There are even duels that just happened off screen “wow, I just lost all my slaves, and I didn’t know” terrible. But for the casual duels that you get a look at, they make characters dumb, take that duel between Eiya and Nerima Muon (The business pimp man) 2 hours, the one that have more money at the end wins (some rules that you need to get money and not use the one that you already have). Obviously Eiya have a plan to make 1 million. The old man makes his workers go and take money from his clubs/shop/businesses. They get almost a million, and they even ask the old man “Do you want us to get more to the other places?” And he says “No” why? Because he just got 10 million from Yuuga. And I would ask you, if you just got a bag full of money, what is the first thing you would do with it? I would give you time to think about it.<br />
<br />
Answer: You count it. <br />
<br />
I mean, I would still send my workers to get more money on my other establishments, but also, I would count how much money I’m getting from this bag, and by doing that I would have seen the time bomb in the bag, or I could at least hear the clock. <br />
<br />
Obviously, the old man plays dumb, the bomb burns the money in the bag and he just lose. I don’t want to say Eiya is a Mary Sue, but I will do it anyway.  <br />
<br />
But you know what is worst? The Judgment SCM, forget the duels, if I snap my fingers you are my slave now. So yeah, get rid of the interesting part that makes the show different, let’s just get slaves. At first I was like “What? How do you defeat that?” but then I said “There is a trick in this, there has to be… right?” lucky me, there is and I’m grateful that they told us, shame it was in a stupid way. The owner of the judgment SCM just get too cozy with one of his slaves, she asks him “How does it work?” he then tells her and BAM! She wasn’t his slave anymore, he gets ambushed and now the JSCM is owned by someone else. But at that moment I knew the path the show was going. The JSCM doesn’t work if the other user hasn’t lost a duel. Do you know who haven’t lose a duel yet? The Mary Sue obviously. <br />
<br />
But then, we get to the part about slaves and the human nature. Again, the first episodes are ok at it, but as the show continues you see how it lacks balls to deliver. I can assure you if this was molded on real life, at least one slave would have committed suicide to escape the torture of being a slave, probably a master would end up killing a slave, other would make their slave kill other master or at least commit multiple crimes. And a lot of sex and rape, but that just gets stale and to be fair, we got rape in the first episode, and there is a fair amount of nudity, don’t get me wrong, it’s not really at par with ecchi series, and it’s not even good nudity so don’t worry about it.<br />
<br />
Oh! I almost forgot to talk about the dumbest part, some kid is possessed by his dead mom so he works like 2 people in one body, so when the mom gets to control the body she doesn’t have to follow the orders of his master. I mean, it could have worked if you just say “Oh yea, this kid, multiple personalities” but no, they went for a possession so they can bring 2 more characters.<br />
<br />
-Pacing: 6/10 (Fine)<br />
When you get boring characters with a bad execution and bad development of a good premise, it just feels bad, but surprising enough, it doesn’t feel like a drag. Shame that there are a few backflashes of things that we already saw and don’t need to be showed again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (entertainment, inspiration):<br />
<br />
Entertainment: 3/10 (very bad)<br />
I only give it points because the first 3 episodes are ok<br />
<br />
-Inspiration 0/10 (worthless) <br />
This is just a special point if the show has something special for me, if it inspires me in any way or if it has some good message, I don’t know, something that makes me feel alive(?). <br />
<br />
OVERALL <br />
If you know math just sum the ratings <br />
Fuck it, I would tell you, it’s a 4. <br />
<br />
Sorry for the bad english, I only know 3 more languages. <br />

    This series is like if the world would ever one day reach Judgment Day, and God brings down the does-it-all device to judge humans the way He does best: Bless the heavenly and persecute the devils with an all-Godly item. And bear in mind, it also goes the long route to showing its strength at gore every step of the way.<br />
<br />
And that my friends, is Dorei-ku The Animation, based on the manga Dorei-ku: Boku to 23-nin no Dorei (or 23 Slaves and Me), which explicitly tells the stories of 23 different people who became slaves, each with their own idiosyncrasies and knacks at their thinking.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282450">
        To be fair, the anime showcased the entire short manga series written by Hiroto Ooishi, and I have to say that while this is a fresh take on the drama-psycho genre, and generally with the manga is better than the anime due to its pacing and people-relevancy chapters that align with the structure of the overall setting, the anime is also a largely toned-down version of it due to the manga being able to portray scenes that just cannot be replicated in anime or if it did get approved, it will only be censored heavily.<br />
<br />
So, we follow Eiya Arakawa, a titular normal girl whom was doing her stuff when one day she found this insane teeth-like device called the SCM (or Slave Control Method), a device that looks plain-looking, until the gist of the device shows, and opens up the world to slavery. Then, another character comes along (Yuuga Ohta) and claims that he doesn’t have much to do in his college life, so a collab with one of his friends also inferred him into the SCM world, and like Eiya, discovered its abilities and attempts the crazy plan to acquire slaves just for fun, until he was imprisoned by other masters and had Eiya (as the gamemaster in disguise in a game) to free him and from there, free others from this insane activity of a helm. And so, with the game of wits, brain-thinking and mental power, the journey to finding out the true source and value of the SCMs ensue.<br />
<br />
First off, Dorei-ku is more than just the typical drama-psychological anime. Yes, it can’t quite compare to better shows like Psycho-Pass, but as a start, it shows promise…until the realization that because of greed and power, many people became masters and slaves (hence the term 23 slaves) that are always targeted by master SCM wielders and the endless duels that happen from time to time. The elephant in the room is that the entire SCM sequence repeats in many characters’ flashbacks, though their coincidence with the SCM is the same-old boring story and it only gets better when the SCMs are used to duel. Speaking of the SCMs, there’s 3 types: the normal master, slave and Judgment SCM (the king of the SCMs where with a snap of the finger, immediately rescinds the enemy into slavery), all with their different levels of difficulty and mind-playing between people.<br />
<br />
The characters here…let’s just say that they exist for as much as an episode, then they are relegated to slavery after that (but not MCs Eiya and Ohta as they need to move along the plotlines). It’s easy to see why they are underdeveloped or developing once their SCM statuses are either demoted or promoted respectively, because as much as they are human beings, nothing will serve them good if they are slaves that follow the masters’ orders. The exposition from the manga provides a detailed analysis of the individual people that come into contact with the SCM, be it their experiences of hatred, greed and the such, but the anime either just downplayed or missed the exposition, for what reasons I’m not able to decipher.<br />
<br />
The art and animation, when it comes to comparisons, I did state that this is quite literally the Ousama Game of 2018, but Dorei-ku’s overall presentation is better than the latter for reasons that people can nitpick about and state similar and different things. This is one of the few anime that has a cross-collaboration project between studios, in this case, TNK (the makers of the horrendous School Days) and Zero-G (Tsugumomo, this season’s Nil Admirari), so if you know the studios’ traits, it’s easy to see why (but if not I’m just nutshell it: TNK on working out the source material and giving it the ‘false’ edgy feels while Zero-G works on animation). Overall presentation looks good, but at times can be heavily panned for the insane amount of blood and gore, something which I never have a liking for.<br />
<br />
The music does do a good representation of the entire series, and while (yes), the songs are decent and portray the world of the series, there’s nothing that could be further redeeming from the truth. It’s a perfect fit for the series, but unappealing on its own.<br />
<br />
So, is Dorei-ku a good watch? Absolutely not, yada yada. If the characters are here to turn you off then please skip this, otherwise it’s only a decent yet mediocre watch, not a great representation of the manga original source though. And as a manga reader, I don’t feel disappointed either, because it lost steam in the process and became yet just another generic psycho-drama adaptation. In the end, Dorei-ku is a dime a dozen, and you can better spend your time elsewhere.

    I think this anime did not get the love it deserved.<br />
<br />
The whole idea was very heavy when I first read the plot in MAL, but I thought it was interesting enough to at least give it a shot, and boy am I glad I did.<br />
<br />
I found the characters very human, you want an SCM to get slaves for power or money, you want the thrill of the duel, you want revenge or simply want to make something you find as awful to stop.<br />
<br />
I have not read the manga, and I am considering it, but I think that as a stand-alone anime this has been interesting

    I’m a great fan of Mind Games and Psychological thrills and chills anime bring up on the entertainment front. Death Note and Kaiji are my all time favourites for this reason.<br />
I was really not expecting so much of a thrill ride that each episode of Dorei brings to the table. Don’t take this show’s premise too seriously, just enjoy the various ways people deceive each other through a variety of Mind games and tricks. This show literally kept me guessing till the end as to what the protagonist (really likeable) Eiya was up to.<br />
I watched the dub and really enjoyed it.<br />
If you really like thought

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287975">
        provoking tricks and deception, then look no further and I’d guarantee that you will surely love this show.

    TL;DR: I created an account on this website just to talk about how bad this is. Please stay away. My main issue is the lack of consistency shown in EVERY aspect of the show. It is a great premise ruined by terrible execution. Mild spoilers below (I won&#039;t spoil the anime for you, but I have to talk about some things in depth).<br />
<br />
-Premise: 8/10<br />
I watched this show because of the premise alone. It seemed like the structure for Yugioh season 0, with the cat and mouse aspect of future diary, and the darkness of Kaiji. I was so excited that I watched this despite hearing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323304">
        the terrible things about it online.<br />
<br />
-Story: 3/10<br />
The great premise was wasted in execution. The anime seemed unsure of itself, and as a result, the structure of the anime was compromised. From the first few episodes, this anime marketed itself as a story focused on the main protagonists as they battle a series of main antagonists. What we are left with is a series where we go entire episodes without seeing our main protagonists and have antagonists replaced before we can get that feeling of resolution. The structure of this anime also allowed for WAY TO MANY CHARACTER INTRODUCTIONS. This caused the story to feel all over the place, and I did not get enough time with any characters to bond with them, minus one character. That character wasn&#039;t even one of the main protagonists. With such a small amount of time to show the story, they also did not utilize said time properly, as half of one episode was verbatim what happened in the last episode but from the other character&#039;s perspective. Not needed at all since we understood what happened originally and no new information was presented.<br />
<br />
-Art and Sound: 5/10<br />
This isn&#039;t my area of expertise so I&#039;ll keep this part short and sweet. Character models were not consistent, but I was able to keep track of everyone just fine. Nothing wowed me. Music kept me immersed but did not captivate my attention. It was just there.<br />
<br />
<br />
-Character: 1/10<br />
As stated earlier, this anime has WAY TO MANY CHARACTER INTRODUCTIONS. Because the show had so many characters to fit in such a small timeframe, a few things occurred. For one thing, we didn&#039;t get to bond with the characters because they would be in such a small portion of the show. I really liked a certain character introduced early in the series, and it seems as if they fired his/her voice actor after a few episodes. Also, because we saw such little of the characters, they were almost forced to act erratically to bring the plot forward. Convictions were overturned in an episode or two because the plot called for it, not because it was natural. Many of these changes occurred off-screen as well. Some of the characters were also unrealistic. I know everyone seems to love the pet in this show, but the magical realism involved in the design is just jarring. Speaking of jarring, it was also jarring how in a show with a lack of consistency, one thing that was consistent was how many characters were connected from means outside the game. It seemed like a stretch and unnecessary.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 2/10<br />
I like these high stakes animes. Yugioh was very creative and diverse in the games played. Kaiji captivated my attention with the amount of detail and cinematography of the games played. This show barely displayed any of these qualities. Some boring games were repeated (one was repeated three times). The games were shot in a boring manner or didn&#039;t have enough time to develop the element of suspense. My suspense was also unmoved because every game, and I do mean every game, was predictable. <br />
Also with each character introduction, we got another explanation of how the SCMs work. It got very old very fast.<br />
<br />
Overall: This was TERRIBLE. do not watch. Stay away. Although mathematically this is a 3/10, I have to leave it with a 2/10 because it gave me a feeling of dread.<br />
<br />
Edit: In retrospect, this is appalling, so I changed it to a 1.

    Brother, an absolutely brilliant and well-thought-out series, I really liked the way they thought in this series and what they were doing. But in some situations it&#039;s a little too strange in my opinion. But I hope for a second season from them, meaning that&#039;s not how the anime ends.<br />
<br />
Story, Characters, Animation, Soundtrack:<br />
Story: The story is absolutely brilliant, it was so well explained and how things evolved in it and, I wish you were more but unfortunately we only have 12 episodes. They went through the story a bit quickly, I think in order to finish it faster, but still I really liked to see

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402759">
        them in this series and what they want to do with ... well what she wants to do.<br />
Characters: The characters were brilliant, they all had something to do and accomplish, okay some had others were just weird.<br />
How is Oota, but to be honest I really liked him and what he wanted to do with the SCM, he was smart but can be crazy my opinion, but here comes our heroine Eiya and adjusts it with her kindness, however she really has something not like him, and it&#039;s a shame we don&#039;t see her girlfriend anymore ... Ryuuou and I really liked him and what he was doing, even though he was a child he thought better than some characters (L vibe). Julia, and I think the weirdest thing about this whole series is to be honest ... well, maybe Ayaka beats her here, but she doesn&#039;t have a personal opinion now.<br />
Animation: The sheep animation was absolutely brilliant, it gave such a pleasant atmosphere to the things from the anime and exciting scenarios. But at times it was too much animation to be honest with you, but I don&#039;t really mind this stuff, but there are some who come just for this stuff.<br />
Soundtrack: The soundtrack was great even at SCM you could hear, yes. That&#039;s how it should be in all anime, in my opinion, the more audio effect the better and a wonderful experience when watching the series.<br />
<br />
Personal Opinion:<br />
Here I learned what it&#039;s like to be in a dangerous game and what to do, but honestly I wouldn&#039;t get into such a thing it doesn&#039;t make sense if you ask me and you&#039;re just wasting your time. But if you know how to use them then you can go in and do what your head takes, but you have to know that there are some that will stop you from what you want to do.

    The truth shit I saw the whole series and there is nothing good to rescue, nor are the bad ones that bad and the good ones leave much to be desired. This anime lacks death and destruction, it is all very rosy. If you&#039;re thinking of watching him do yourself the favor of not looking at this shit. The truth is a total waste of time but hey sometimes happens.<br />
<br />
<br />
En español:<br />
La verdad una mierda vi toda la serie y no hay nada bueno que rescatar ni los malos son tan malos y los buenos dejan mucho que desear. Le falta muerte y destrucción a este

          <span style="display: none;" id="review389784">
        anime es todo muy color de rosas. Si estas pensando en verlo hacerte el favor de no mirar esta mierda. La verdad una perdida de tiempo total pero bueno algunas veces pasa.

    Remember Goblin Slayer backlash? Yap, its the same issue, and was it bad? Exactly, it wasn&#039;t! Hence why this poor reception by the media. (A Brief and Spoilless Review is my main intention.)<br />
<br />
- The anime starts off in an aggressive tone, as expected of a Seinen(grown up&#039;s anime gender) if you are a sensitiv person or plan to watch this with someone else, you better consider it. Due the nature of the plot it self, &quot;Masters and Slaves&quot;, those roles are assigned, immediately after you get someone to play a random-game and have the &quot;Win or Lose&quot; roles assigned. The winner gets supremacy over the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307142">
        loser. There are some small rules in place etc to prevent exploits and life threatening situations, but bluntly speaking... the winner can demand anything(including sexual services) anytime, as many times he/she wants with no bounds.<br />
- But this is not all, if you are familiar with another series called &quot;Liar Game&quot;, you will find some &quot;twisted plot twists&quot;. The Story isn&#039;t a straight forward one(in a &quot;protagonist wins all and all ends well&quot; sense) and it will expand in size, to a point it of being more than just &quot;games, so you will see quite some twisted cast of characters with good or damental intentions. Even the protagonists aren&#039;t inset of losing either, yes sh!t happens. Plot twists are a recurrent thing in this type of series, if you hunger for them, you are in for a treat.<br />
- There is bound to be some &quot;fan service&quot;, but it isn&#039;t has intrusive has many other series. But be mindful of it, that it can escalate pretty quick!(which its a nice thing when done correctly, in my honest opinion)<br />
<br />
[Characters]<br />
- Although all characters in the series look random, in reality, they are all connected in a way or another. The protagonists are funny and cocky. But overall everyone has simple or more complex motives/drives, others stronger than others. And age wise, its quite diversified.<br />
- After the 1st episode, its when you going to start getting the scope of the real size of things and how they actually work. Consequently, same goes for how small the Protagonists point of view were until then.<br />
<br />
[Enjoyment &amp; Overall]<br />
 - Personally, after have watched almost a thousand series, I consider this one to be quite enjoyable one, specially if you are a more open minded person. I found this anime quite interesting, entertaining, edgy and mature the twists just keep opening more my apetite for more.<br />
- But do me a favor, make sure you watch it all before you judge. A good thing that can be a decisive factor for its the &quot;ending&quot;, at the very least it felt &quot;satisfying&quot;, most big plot quests will be answered by the end as well so you can relax and enjoy the show till the end whiteout need to god for the source material.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: The Score of 6/10 does not reflect this anime potential the slightest, this is anime to be at least a 8/10, hence why I&#039;m here doing yet another review.<br />

    So I will be honest i watched it because the cover looked like a hentai but it wasnt labled as one so i had to see what was up and i was pleasantly surprise. however major trigger warnings on this show; sexual violence, physical violence, and verbal violence are major features as it explores the insane implication of a mind control device.<br />
<br />
So the story is a little complicated due to the amount of characters and plot lines that come together by the end and that will be off putting for some viewers but personally i am a fan of more complex shows as it makes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review343143">
        watching the show more fun because you can try to solve the puzzle as it goes along without it being too easy.<br />
<br />
it is actually not as sexual as it looks for like 90% of the anime which was a shock (considering the cover and the break cards look like porn). it mainly used sex as a pointed thing. like in the first episode there is a rape sense (mostly off camera) that is used to show why a character later does something. most unnecessary sexuality is from the chest size of woman but as a large chested woman i dont mind it that much but i could see it being annoying but it is sorta like just normal male target anime level of boob.<br />
<br />
I think this show would of done better with either a longer running time (so we could flush out the large cast better) or a smaller cast (that better fits the running time) but if you like psychological thrillers with lots of drama and mind games this is a pretty good show. i would suggest it to people who like death note but anyone watching this should be over 18 as it covers very adult content.

    Do you want a magical retainer that lets you fulfill your S&amp;M fantasies?<br />
<br />
Yeah, me neither.<br />
<br />
Anyway so this anime is about a magical retainer developed to train dogs, but if people use it, it allows users to enslave others if they win some kind of game of chance in a &quot;duel.&quot;<br />
<br />
That&#039;s pretty much the premise of what winds up being an anime about the worst people you&#039;ve ever met doing awful things to each other because I guess that&#039;s what people into this kind of crap like to do.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s mostly what would happen if you could take advantage of someone and how much of a jerk

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297957">
        you would be given the chance. The cast is bereft of likable characters and watching them take advantage of each other puts a bad tase in my mouth--and the anime goes into pretty sickening detail in case you&#039;re interested.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s easy to get burned out on the sheer off-putting nature of the characters that I stopped watching this about halfway through, hoping that they&#039;d just all kill each other.<br />
<br />
Art starts out gorgeous, but quickly goes off model. Voice acting is decent, but it seems even the VAs don&#039;t seem too interested in what&#039;s going on here.<br />
<br />
Overall it&#039;s disappointing and keeps getting worse the more you get into it.

    Great series especially if you&#039;re into S&amp;M type stuff. Very intriguing plot and I genuinely enjoyed it for the most part. Most of the characters are interesting and well fleshed out. The art style is great too.<br />
<br />
However, there is a huge gaping plot hole that I don&#039;t get. They know that this guy can insta beat anyone in a duel right? Why not just take our your chip right before a known confrontation and physically beat him to death. Easy solution. It even says slaves can go without the chips for short periods so I just don&#039;t get it.

    Short overview<br />
<br />
With beautiful visuals, a catchy soundtrack and interesting concept, Dorei-ku certainly has a pretty interesting and unique foundation. My only real complaint would be regarding its story-telling and plot, which unfortunately has A LOT of PLOT-holes. But if you&#039;re ready to look past that, this is definitely worth a watch.<br />
<br />
The story<br />
<br />
Dorei-ku, as mentioned before, has a pretty cool and unique foundation. The base story is not bad, and its style reminds me of something like &quot;Kakegurui&quot; - where the human psyche is what really makes the story. Unfortunately, the anime contradicts itself by constantly breaking the made up &quot;laws&quot; or &quot;rules&quot;, which is a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285339">
        major annoyance throughout the series. There are also very unrealistic things happening, which sometimes makes it hard to even take the anime seriously. <br />
<br />
The Characters<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the characters are pretty similar to the story: Cool designs with an interesting base, but very little development takes place which makes pretty much ALL characters very very flat. We only really get a little insight into who the characters are, and it feels more and more rushed with each episode. At one point, it feels like they just introduce new characters just for the sake of it. I imagine they bear a heavier significance in the Manga, but I do not want to watch an anime that cannot stand on its own. After their own &quot;episode&quot;, they basically become props in the background and some even disappear without explanation. The only proper screentime is arguably given to the protagonist. <br />
     Additionally, some decisions are very out of character and also very unrealistic. As mentioned in the plot section, many unrealistic events take place which renders some characters very <br />
<br />
Aesthetics ¨<br />
<br />
The sheer design is beautiful. Some scenes are truly outstanding, and I&#039;ve got nothing really to complain about in this department. The intro is pretty catchy, but does it capture the spirit of the anime? Maybe not, but definitely added it to my playlist. Other than the intro, I cannot say the musical aspect of the anime made any bigger impression on me. <br />

    The anime could be good, but it make so many mistakes. It has a different proposition, and some interesting twists, but there are several issues that make the experience sucks.<br />
<br />
At the beginning of the anime, you get tense not knowing what can happen to the characters, everything is uncertain, but over time you really stop worrying, because becoming a slave, which at first seems to be the most horrible thing possible, it soon becomes common. People enslaved left and right, slaves who change masters, and characters you even forget the name for being totally forgotten after their episode of apparition.<br />
<br />
Speaking of characters, what an ugly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323373">
        and forced evolution. In the end everyone is nice and has a reason to commit the greatest atrocities, and everything is revealed because &quot;I totally take away someone&#039;s free will because I have a bigger reason than no one understands&quot;, and the worst part is everyone THINK THAT&#039;S OK, the other characters just accept it. In one episode the character X is being an extreme son of a bitch, but in the next everyone has gotten along. At one point one of the slaves still dares to call the group &quot;family.&quot;<br />
<br />
The music is too weak, disconnected with the intensity that the scene proposes. In times of tension, when freedom is betting on a challenge, and the music looks like those used in comedy animes.<br />
<br />
Other than that, because they ran so much with the anime, it has several holes, and things that sometimes make no sense, besides problems that could be solved with a simple conversation.

    A retainer-like device known as the &quot;SCM&quot; is being sold on the internet and rumours have it if you wear it and challenge another person that&#039;s also wearing to a duel, you can turn them into your slave when you win. Ohta Yuuga comes across Eia Arakawa one day after dumping her best friend. After discovering how daring and smart she is, he requests she becomes his insurance partner. He knew the risks of the device but wanted the thrill it would give him during duels while he tested his own abilities. However, he also wanted to be prepared for the worst case scenario and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292682">
        that was for Eia to win him back if he ever lost. Despite having just met, Eia thought she understood what he meant and agrees to join him but ends up finding herself caught up in a battle for slaves between masters.<br />
<br />
I think this show is another one for the masochists who enjoy seeing others suffering. And as with most masochist shows, there&#039;s sex involved (and rape in this case). The show is based loosely on a Manga with a slightly different name, &quot;Dorei-ku: Boku to 23 no Dorei [Slave Region: The 23 Slaves and I]&quot;. Direction feels a bit like Death Note or even King&#039;s Game because you see brief flashes of rules that the SCM operates on but that&#039;s about it. Doesn&#039;t have any depth like the mind games Death Note had. Maybe a bit better than King&#039;s Game because it isn&#039;t filled with gruesome deaths but there is a lot of pain and suffering. It tries to lighten up the mood with a few jokes but mostly crude ones.<br />
<br />
Of course, the characters aren&#039;t your average person. Mostly people who are most likely under a lot of pressure like hostess and hosts that keep clients company in red club districts, people bored with their daily life including your common dominant little kid character. Games used for duels are also very simple like your usual rock-paper-scissors so no riddles or mystery to join in here - some just there for a joke while some are just messed up.<br />
<br />
Each episode basically focuses on someone different. Or something... Their stories intertwine but I think it tries to do too much in such a short series. Characters end up with too little of a role in the main story so you don&#039;t empathise with them too much and the plot ends up wearing too thin. It kind of tries to be clever as it alternates between the different masters so you&#039;re trying to guess how they managed to outsmart each other but, their schemes aren&#039;t very grand to make an impression. It&#039;s also odd how the slaves from different walks of life are just suddenly friends instead of trying to find a way out.<br />
<br />
It might have been an alright show if it didn&#039;t feature abuse but, I guess it doesn&#039;t have &quot;slave&quot; in its title for nothing. Art isn&#039;t anything impressive and character designs feel a bit off. I don&#039;t think there were any OST tracks that caught my attention but the OP &quot;Karakara no Kokoro [Parched Heart]&quot; isn&#039;t too bad.<br />
<br />
Death Note would probably be a much better alternative to this show with its dark theme and mind games if you haven&#039;t watched it already. Just without the abuse.

    wow ... this anime was just bad. when i first started it, the concept really appeared to me. i enjoy all genres especially psychological so i jumped onto this anime. i really shouldn&#039;t have. <br />
<br />
the story : the slave concept is pretty new to me and seemed interesting. it was executed terribly. it always felt like way too many things were happening at once?? the beginning was okay, but by the end i was begging for something exciting to happen, but i continued to be disappointed and just started wishing for this anime to end. it would bounce from one character to the next without

          <span style="display: none;" id="review283860">
        really seeming to finish the other character&#039;s story?? it was way too all over the place and started to add random character&#039;s backstories for no reason. then all of a sudden random characters came together to save the day and it just didn&#039;t seem to make sense. <br />
<br />
the art : wasn&#039;t great but wasn&#039;t awful either. it irritated me some of the characters always had a little blush to their face but whatever. the art was okay, a little weird and stiff at times but other than that it was okay. <br />
<br />
the sound : don&#039;t even remember, but i&#039;ll just say it was okay. <br />
<br />
the characters : OH GOD THE CHARACTERS. i don&#039;t even know how to begin. for starters THERE WERE WAY TOO MANY!!!!! literally every episode was split into two characters points of view. one half of the episode was one character, the other half was another character. but characters never repeated. this resulted in characters falling way too flat! you literally never had a chance to really get to know them except in their half of an episode. the minute they introduced a character i forgot their name because they never mentioned it again. the show didn&#039;t really seem to have a &#039;main character&#039; which bothered me. random characters suddenly turned good or evil and you couldn&#039;t even tell why or how because THEY WERE LITERALLY ONLY THE FOCUS FOR HALF AN EPISODE!!!! the characters reasons for doing things didn&#039;t even make sense. no characters seemed to have actual development because you never saw it happen, one second they were evil next second BOOM they&#039;re good. honestly felt like the dog had more screen time then some of the characters. they were just so awful it made no sense, this was probably my reason for disliking it so much. <br />
<br />
overall : it honestly may be generous of me to give this anime a 5. after about episode 5 or 6 i was begging for this anime to end. i think what ruined it for me were the characters. even if the story is bad, characters can usually make up for it. but this time, they really ruined it. bad story execution and flat characters ruined this anime.

    This is another dystopia story, which revolves around a device which can enslave people to each other. There are numerous characters but not really good and evil or more accurately no good, everyone&#039;s evil at some point or another. I think this is the one single message behind this show - too much power can and will corrupt everyone. Coming to think about it - I&#039;d say it&#039;s even somewhat realistic because if a thing like that were to actually exist that&#039;s probably what people would do with it.<br />
Having said that, the plot itself gets a little boring past the first few episodes. Basically person

          <span style="display: none;" id="review291052">
        A enslaving person B only so be himself enslaved to person C etc with background stories of each character (obviously all tragic in some sense). Somewhere in the middle there&#039;s also the background story about how the device was created but it doesn&#039;t contribute much to the main story line anyway.<br />
Art is good. Quite dark but that&#039;s not surprising given that the show focuses on the underworld. Sound is great, nothing much to say here.<br />
Bottom line - This is a nice concept and overall nice plot but it could have been easily reduced to a single 90 minute movie without losing much.

    This is another one of those shows that tries too hard to be edgy and raw and brutal and ends up being cringy and bland and boring.<br />
<br />
The plot is pretty average and quite frankly kind of ridiculous even for edgy anime standards. The whole &quot;magical braces that control people minds even when they&#039;re removed&quot; is just too nonsensical and convenient and the explanation they give for it is incredibly weak. And hey, i get it, it&#039;s anime, it&#039;s not supposed to be super realistic and incredibly believable but the thing is they kind of try to make it seem like that, they take the whole

          <span style="display: none;" id="review288133">
        thing super seriously and even give a lame &quot;scientific&quot; explanation for the whole thing but it&#039;s all super weak and convenient. It just doesn&#039;t feel organic or even well thought of.<br />
<br />
Also, this is another one of those shows where Japan has no government, the police basically doesn&#039;t exist and people are harassed, assaulted and even killed in the streets without nobody doing anything about it. Super fresh stuff.<br />
<br />
The breaking point for me was when the story hints that the main villain might be a 10 year old super evil genius. At this point i decided the show didn&#039;t give me enough to actually care about it and i wasn&#039;t willing to keep watching a super edgy and raw show where the evil mastermind behind the whole slave game was potentially a child. If you like that sort of thing though, this could be the perfect anime for you.<br />
<br />
Looks good, sounds good, the plot is bad and the character are average at best.
