    &quot;THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS&quot; <br />
<br />
Like a fellow anime watcher of mine said, sometimes you just need to shut off all your logic, chill and enjoy some animes.<br />
So what if it is another generic isekai anime?<br />
Sometimes i just enjoy watching some op guy blowing some sh*t up and showoff his powers.<br />
I was just gona chill at my chair and enjoy it and give it a try and it ended up actually not being bad at the first 2 and even 3 episodes.<br />
<br />
So, is it worth watching this Anime?<br />
Well, quick answer is no, and here is why.<br />
<br />
We can start from the random cuts with no transitions that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337320">
        instantly started the next scene, and that is problably consequance of them trying to save some seconds due to the extremly rushed anime approach that they decided to go with, and you already know how bad rushing the plot in animes can go, take for example, Arifureta or even Tokyo Ghoul:re.<br />
<br />
The first 3 episodes were a little bit rushed not gona lie, and sometimes you wonder if you missed something out leaving plot holes on the story, but not to the point that it does not make you hate the show, YET!<br />
<br />
The animation, was average, some scenes were static images with that tricky camera just sliding across the screen and you could notice some CGI in some scenes.<br />
<br />
But then you get to episode 3 when they try to develop the characters a bit and oh boy... it is actually so bad executed i cant even enjoy that development and here is where the huge plot holes start to take place.<br />
<br />
*Minor spoiler*<br />
<br />
So now they all know he is high tier mage when its nowhere said or show to them, like, when are they told he is a high tier, how do they know?<br />
<br />
Then they start doing stupid sh*t to impresse the Mc to get into his party and almost die later to be saved by? you guessed, the MC ofc.<br />
<br />
Then on episode 4 hits up and this takes a rushed episode to a hole new level, they rush it so f*cking much that it makes you think you actually missed 2 full episodes.<br />
<br />
Now be carefull with major spoilers below:<br />
<br />
*Spoiler allert*<br />
<br />
The ep 3 ends with the guy moving into his master&#039;s mansion that he inherited and the MC starts living there by himself.<br />
Then ep 4 starts with them on a f*cking flying spaceship and im already checking if there were some extra seconds on last episode after the ending to see if i missed something that big.<br />
Then all of the sudden you have like 10 people in his new house and oh, have i told you he now uses teleportation magic too?<br />
Like, ??????<br />
Did i actually Skip a hole season or what?<br />
<br />
The development and pace of the story is so bad it wants me to rip the eyeballs of my skull...<br />
<br />
Final score 4/10 <br />
<br />
Had potencial but trowed it out of the f*cking window.<br />

    There’s nothing wrong about anime with clichés, even when they have been milked to death. Some clichés are actually cleverly executed in the case of deconstruction of certain themes or plot elements. Character study can also play its cards right and make an anime look beyond what it really is. But when the time calls for Hachi-nan tte, Sore wa Nai deshou to shine, it completely destroys itself and achieves absolutely nothing than wasting our time.<br />
<br />
Trying to find anything appealing about this show at first glance isn’t easy. The key visual is covered by generic looking characters and an isekai based protagonist. The synopsis reads

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344288">
        like most isekai fantasy plot you’ve heard of these days. Oh but there’s political drama! Perhaps that could change the phase of the show, right? Wrong. This anime adheres to what most people assumes and it’s like part of a genetic code. The DNA formula for this show connects the most boring possible themes in the show with an even degenerate cast of characters.<br />
<br />
Shingo Ichinomiya is the main protagonist who takes on the role of Wendelin after waking up in a fantasy world. From the beginning, he is portrayed as a character with potential and it’s up to himself to unlock them. Thanks to Alfred Reinford’s tutorage and his own determination, Wendelin evolves into a gifted mage and even forms his own party of adventurers. And if you guess it right now, you’re right. It’s a group of female adventurers and easy to paint them as members of his harem. This is where the show takes the fall as the main female cast in the show is hammered with lazy writing. Let’s start with Elize, the priestess and perhaps most pure member of Wendelin’s party. Here, she’s portrayed with a kind heart but lacks any distinctive traits outside of her healing abilities. Louise, the martial artist fills the role of the physical fighter in the party. Somehow, the show wanted to make her into a comic relief by inserting embarrassing jokes. She also shares a rivalry with Ena, a spear wielding girl with a tomboyish personality. At first glance, she would appear to be someone capable of being a poster girl of the show but as every episode progresses, it’s hard to imagine anything noteworthy to say about Ena. She’s just another member of Wendelin’s harem added for the sake of a harem. And finally, there’s Wilma, a character that I can safely say has no personality. Debuting late in the story, Wilma’s character role brings out some of the worst parts of the show including her gluttonous appetite and offering absolutely nothing relevant. With such a character cast, I’m afraid this show hits the lowest common denominator even for a fantasy isekai.<br />
<br />
If you’re in a mood to watch a fun fantasy plot, then prepare for the worst. It’s even less fun when watching these characters engage in political drama between the higher class nobles. One of the more prominent subplot involves a political marriage between Wendelin and Elize. As fate has it, she develops genuine feelings for him and their relationship evolves beyond just politics. But unfortunately, this series doesn’t have time to fully develop that relationship. It instead jumps around between subplots by introducing elements such as martial arts tournaments, hired bodyguards for Wendelin, and other requests such as monster hunting. Between every episode, it seems the show never knows what it truly wants and fails to get us invested into the main story. Viewers will be left with concerns on how weak the plot develops until they just give up. That’s how I felt anyways by the time this anime even reached its half way point. To adapt a large volumes of novels into a 1-cour (12 episodes) anime is nothing but a recipe for disaster.<br />
<br />
There’s more than one ways to adapt a show but the studios behind this project didn’t exactly step up to the plate for its character designs or overall look. To appeal the audience, it needed a distinctive character cast even if it means their physical features. It’s sad to say but the show limited itself with a universally dull looking character roster. Every female character has a similar face and molded with lackluster dress codes. Sometimes, the anime tries to bring out their features with decorative clothes but in the end never hits its expectations. Even the monsters look insufferable such as the CGI dragon and the horrid zombies. The only saving grace for the show’s art style is the occasional world fiction that seems plausible at best.<br />
<br />
It’s not going to be a satisfying watch. I’ll say this as straightforward as possible but if you want to explore something from the fantasy genre catalog, this isn’t one to aim for. From the lazy plot writing to the uncharismatic character cast, there’s little Hachi-nan tte, Sore wa Nai deshou will offer to the audience. Do something better with your time and don’t recommend this to your friends, or in fact, anyone.

    *[This review contains spoilers]*<br />
Another trashy Isekai anime? Are you kidding me? Some people say that for some anime you need to turn off all the logic, but for this anime? You need to turn off basically your entire brain.<br />
<br />
You know, I&#039;m not that hard to impress, if you give me an anime where the MC is OP and perfect, gets all the girls, and has enough fan service to satisfy my boner, the anime is automatically more than a 5 for me. So how did this happen? Why&#039;d I give 8th son a 2 even though it meets all those requirements (Except for the fan

          <span style="display: none;" id="review351857">
        service part)? After I watched the 8th son I went to Isekai Smartphone and increased the score to a 6. Yes, that really happened. This anime has the potential to beat Kenja no Mago and Death March to obtain the title of the worst Isekai anime of all time.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t want this review to sound like a rant so I&#039;m gonna get right into the story. The story is just like any other generic Isekai, except this time the MC is actually born into a family of Nobles, a poverty stricken family of nobles. Now let me start from the beginning, the MC is a 25 year old Isekai&#039;d into a 6 year old&#039;s body. Apparently his mind is also equivalent to a 6 year old&#039;s, normally you&#039;d expect him to act a bit more mature. Up until now the anime looked somewhat unique, until it started fucking itself up. He finds out that he has a really high aptitude for magic. He meets a zombie in the forest who isn&#039;t actually a zombie but technically is a zombie because he held a deep regret inside of him that made him a zombie, his regret was that he always wanted a disciple so he could pass the magic he learned 30 years ago to his disciple. Too bad they literally killed him in 2 episodes, fucking 2 episodes. Sadly he was the only likeable character in the whole anime.<br />
<br />
And now, time for the classic Isekai trope, the timeskip. It has been 7 years. Keep in mind that the MC is originally a 25 year old, so after the timeskip he is supposed to be mentally 32 years old. Everyone matures when they hit 30, right? RIGHT? Or so I thought... The MC is the same clueless bastard as he was 7 years ago. He goes to the Adventurer&#039;s Academy or some shit but he fails at making any friends, because like 90% of the trashy Isekai anime MCs this MC is uncommunicative as well. &quot;Cho-cho-tto ma-ma-tte. Haaaaa? Eugh??&quot; That&#039;s all he says in the entire anime, at least thats what I&#039;ve heard. <br />
The MC is a god damn deaf idiot, he went to Adventurer&#039;s Academy but all the other students were intimidated by him, but apparently the MC thought that no one wanted to talk to him because he was weird. Even though most of the time there are people who are loudly saying how they want to impress the MC and shit but he is completely zoned out, he cannot hear shit. <br />
Somehow the 2 girls and that one boy become his party members, and then some other stuff happened, lots of blah blah, boring mid tier fight scenes, and that&#039;s about it for the story. I&#039;d suggest you to watch the rest of the shit show yourself, but at the same time I suggest you never watch this anime unless you want to put yourself through misery.<br />
<br />
The MC is apathetic to how nobility works, he lived in a family of nobles for 7 years, right? So he must have some sense about nobility, right? Nope, absolutely none. He gets surprised at every little thing and the concept of nobility gets a &quot;holding a torch in front of a caveman&quot; kind of reaction from him.<br />
At one point of the anime, the MC got a choice to literally summon anything, ANYTHING, apparently there was some kind of magic circle capable of summoning anything the user images by using a huge amount of magic power. So what does the MC-kun summon? At first he summons panties, what does he summon next? Tuna, fucking tuna fish, god damn tuna fish, so he can eat it with soy sauce. I&#039;m done with this anime.<br />
<br />
The girls in the harem? They are literally one dimensional, they have 0 depth. They are emotionless. I love when the anime tries so hard to make us feel bad for those girls when in reality all of the girls are emotionless plastic bags. 2 of the girls literally gave up their body&#039;s to the MC, why? So they can abuse him. They even say it 2 or 3 times how they will puppet the MC after they marry him. What does the MC do? He gladly accepts them as his fiancee along with his other fiancee that he got forced into engaging.<br />
<br />
Overall this anime was the worst anime of 2020. Yes, I went that far. I don&#039;t even need to watch any other anime of 2020 to say this, but this is by far the worst. It&#039;s like it was written by some 20-30 year old man suffering from mid life crisis that has a raging older sibling inferiority complex, throughout the entire anime their motto was &quot;Why should the elder brother get all the good treatment&quot; lol. This anime is vomit worthy. I have already given it the title of the worst Isekai of all time, let me say that once again. This anime wins the title of the worst Isekai of all time.<br />
<br />
Now I&#039;ll go watch Isekai Smartphone because that bullshit was a million times better than this,

    Obvios spoiles ahead but they are so predictable you are not missing anything.<br />
Every season seems to have a mandatory bad isekai, and that season was not an exception. If you wanted something original - look elsewhere, if you wanted something good - same. But let me dive into this pile of trash to show you how bad it is.<br />
First things first - visuals and sound. Generic and cheap looking 2d plus horrible and clunky CGI is a good indication of a badly made cash grab, add some generic soulless BGM and you have a full picture.<br />
Story and characters. It is your generic isekai in all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344299">
        of its bad ways. MC that is effectively 40 years old (and he was an office worker, not some desocialised neet) behaves like a 10 years old? Check. None of his previous experience is used? Almost check, cause he brings SUPERIOR JAPANESE FOOD to his new world. He gets everything including OP magic without any effort, gets some loyal friends who lack any personal traits except for one-two gimmicks, slays a dragon that only he could kill even though there was a more experienced mage near (of course that mage could not use required spell), gets some completely stupid reward and high social status, and don&#039;t forget a holy maiden as a waifu. All of this with almost no effort, as I mentioned previously. If it is not a generic self insert - I don&#039;t know what is. And yes, in one sentence I just retold you most of the plot, the rest is not better, cause MC never encounters any threat to his life or worthy challenge, everyone opposing him is comically bad and evil while everyone supporting him is comically good. Oh, and I forgot to mention that he basically has a harem cause what is an isekai without one?<br />
<br />
To conclude I will point out, that this anime is so boring, dull and basic that I can&#039;t recall at least one good moment in it. And I have to ask you: do you really have nothing better to do?

    *WARNING: Minor Spoilers for the overall tone of the series, but kept as vague as possible!*<br />
<br />
<br />
When I first noticed that this show was being adapted for this season, it was already 3 episodes in. Half the reason for that was: despite [me] having read the LN many volumes in, and having reread the manga twice (1-2 years between, 2nd time coincidentally being only 2 months ago’ish), the story and title were so unmemorable that it was really only because I had time to kill and wanted “something brain-dead” that I reread it at all. <br />
<br />
So when I realised that someone had adapted this, my only

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336940">
        thoughts were, “wow, what are you even thinking?!! There’s better brainless Isekais for the picking that are way more novel!”...<br />
<br />
So, I decided that: if I was going to somehow get through THIS particular story, I’d have to do it ‘as it airs’—else I’d absolutely drop it by around the 7th episode (by my estimations at the time) which, whereabouts, the character-relations and the “obligatory Harem” are all at their peak with nowhere to go - as the “authentic experience” of this series is a typical case of an author writing themselves into a corner real-hard and fast...<br />
<br />
You see: in the original, the MC gets handed everything on a platter, and I mean everything. As a result: no matter where you looked, there was no tension, no challenges, no mystery or foreboding, no politics even, and just generally nowhere to progress to—and since that leaves only “down” - for our MC to fall from graces per se - that would only be an option if everything wasn’t so ubiquitously sublime and, ... frankly, inhuman. (There, I said it). So, the author only had 1 option left: <br />
An Adventure/Slice of Life (like Death March where they travel to new places and eat “DELICIOUS FOODS”*x^666) mixed with Comedy &amp; gags that all danced to the tune of, “Oh! Woe is me! How HARD it is to have suuuch a perfect LIFE! *queue laughter from his 2million+ waifus who have 1-mode of emotions and that’s Smile*”.<br />
<br />
... Sorry about that. *Ahem*. <br />
As you can see, I was terribly worried of just how much this adaptation would be a flop—until I started watching the first episode and spotted ALL the liberties the Studio adapting this had taken. Changes, changes, changes!<br />
<br />
•A rewritten 1st introduction that delivers the premise of our MC’s personal AND family predicament (and the POINT OF THE DAMNED TITLE!!!)<br />
•An OP [which, by the way, is way more fitting than any VA knockoff-pop song with 0 longevity] that’s timed perfectly to tidy the presentation of the storyline and accentuate the development of our MC into his new world<br />
•A fast-track to the most important meeting of our MC’s new life, not wasting any time to “get to what matters”<br />
•An absolutely beautiful ED song that’s, once again, an original by real musicians! (WUT, BOTH ARE!?! Dye me impressed, Shin-Ei Animation or whoever was mostly in-charge...)<br />
<br />
If ‘The Good’ ended here, I wouldn’t be writing this review—and frankly, even after all that I’d seen, my head was NOW saying, “Oh no... This studio is really competent... I feel even worse for them now...”, because I was now thinking that ‘no matter how good an adaptation is, if the source-material is contemptible garbage, it’s still unsalvageable’. <br />
Ohhh, how wrong I was! Not only did they rewrite the first chapters of the ‘collective source-material’, but they bloody went and rewrote the next 3 episodes as well!... “HOOWW?! WHY DON’T MORE STUDIOS DO THIS???”, is what the excited voice in my head was NOW saying after witnessing what, before now, I’d just written off as ‘impossible’ and ‘wishful thinking’, etc. <br />
<br />
Remember how I vaguely recapped all the issues that the Manga &amp; Light Novels had? They all revolves around every character, relation, achievement, event, and so on, ALL collectively feeling “ubiquitously inhuman or monotonous”. In this Anime-Adaptation, ... *breathes deeply*... this has, so far, been rectified (at least, as much as possible). That’s right. The characters have motives and emotions that ‘come into conflict’ with our MC, AND he’s no longer a “smiling doll” without ‘worries or care or actual troubles’. Above that, the side characters aren’t just there to inhabit the background either and have genuine effects on the main cast.<br />
<br />
Now: I’ve been singing praises for this adaptation for “humanising the inhuman” and for their use of ‘creative liberties’, but it’d be unfair to ignore the glaring fault that this series still faces no matter how many Creative Liberties the studio and staff in charge of this mess-of-an-Isekai take, and that’s the very first scene. The very first scene acts to show the personal woes that stick with our MC all throughout this show (for now, at least) - and that’s that he was reborn from being a “White-Collared Office Worker” - but it also gives us a preview of ‘things to come’—and they look identical to the problems of the source material. Remember how I talked about “the author boxing themselves in”? This ‘preview’ shows a future where that fate is inevitable, sadly, and I don’t know how the studio/adaptation will get around or revitalise that. <br />
<br />
In fact, when episode 4 rolled along, I began to see signs of 1) budget issues (at least, I saw a huge drop in the sound effects, the CGI, and especially the animation quality), and 2) scene upon scene that neglects everyone but our protagonist as he makes extremely boring and artistically-repugnant facial expressions along with flat jokes [I mentioned the Slice of Life “woe is me!” gags being overused in the source] that at one point, even for an easy, well-known gag, it was so poorly timed that I had to check that my video player hadn’t glitched and skipped a good 20-40 frames... <br />
<br />
I don’t know if these changes in quality are just a coincidence, or if they have to do with tighter schedules and potential ‘correspondence’ project-management due to COVID messing everything up, but I just hope I’m the only one who felt these ways with the latest episode and that this isn’t going to become the new standard after 3 initial excellent episodes to this series.<br />
<br />
All is not lost though. The adaptation has managed to do so much good thus far that I’m actually thoroughly enjoying this series, so they may just be able to cleverly use storyboarding or their “omnipotent Creative Liberties” (lel) to write-out or skip/fast-track all the problems out of a season of this show. Who knows? <br />
They’ve done beyond “incredible” so far, all things considered—so I’ll harbour faith! <br />
(Fingers crossed I don’t come to eat my words - massively - later, ahaha).<br />
<br />
Note: this is ‘so far’<br />
Story: 8.5<br />
Sound: 7.5<br />
Characters: 7.5<br />
Art: 5 (biggest weakness if the show doesn’t pick-up back to the quality of the first episodes)<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
Overall: 8<br />
<br />
Still a good start. Let’s keep it up, Hachinan tte!

    My expectations were so low, but holy fric!<br />
Hachi-nan tte, Sore wa Nai deshou! is your typical generic isekai show about a salaryman turned OP af mage in another world and if that is not the most unoriginal plot in every isekai anime then i don&#039;t know what is.<br />
<br />
Story: 3/10<br />
 The story is so goddamn cringy. A japanese salaryman reincarnated as a child in another world (yeah, i see you Youjo Senki), discovered that he&#039;s a magical genius and sets off for an adventure. Tell me if that isn&#039;t the most unoriginal story that you have ever watched.<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
 It&#039;s pretty fair and decent art-wise. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337939">
        character designs were great but the CGI animation especially on the fight scene with the dragon threw me off.<br />
<br />
Character: 2/10<br />
 Most of the supporting characters on this show is just plain and simply not interesting at all. The main character is so cringy and acts like a total brat despite him being an adult in his original world.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5/10<br />
 Despite all the bad things about this show, I pretty much enjoy every episode of it and who knows, maybe the story will get interesting in the future episodes.<br />
<br />
Overall 4.4/10<br />
 If you&#039;re looking for an action, adventure, and fantasy anime that has something new to it, then this show is simply not for you.

    What Is It About?<br />
Shingo Ichinomiya was a young and single salaryman. One day he falls asleep to find out that he now lives in another world in the body of a 5-year-old boy. He is a part of a poor family, which has many kids, with him being the youngest son, which makes any hopes for a bright future for him near impossible. However, Shingo has an aptitude to a magic. Will it help him to succeed in the new harsh world he lives in now? <br />
<br />
The main protagonist of the 8th son? Are you kidding me? is your favorite corporate slave, who is drowning

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344282">
        in the routine life. One day, he becomes the archetypical protagonist of the “Reborn in another world” sub-genre of isekai stories, except he is not quite reborn. Shingo Ichinomiya simply gets sleepy and wakes up in the body of Wendelin von Benno Baumeister, the 8th son of an aristocratic family in a fantasy world. At first, Ichinomiya thinks it is just a dream, but then finds out that it is his new reality. On top of that, he is the youngest son in a poor noble family, which means that the youngest son gets nothing and will have to build his life all on his own. <br />
<br />
And that is it. While it is quite obvious that a story like this just reminds you of every single isekai story that you have seen so far and you will be right, if you say something like that. The storyline of The 8th son? Are you kidding me? has way too many cliché and does not give the viewer reasonable answers about its world. One of such examples is the fact that Wendelin had a whole life until Ichinomiya randomly stole his body and identity. Nothing is explained about it: how did it happen, what happened to the 5 year old kid, did he just vanish from the world and get possessed by Shingo  Ichinomiya, why would someone do that, and many many other questions. Therefore, the storyline suffers from too many flaws for it to be somewhat interesting and reasonable for the viewer to follow.<br />
<br />
The animation is adequate and the art is quite pleasant. There are many castles, cool-looking backgrounds, characters that look unique and pretty. Another thing I find important to mention is that there is no fanservice in this series. OST wise, the series is average at best. <br />
<br />
Character wise, Shingo Ichinomiya/Wendelin von Benno Baumeister is your typical isekai main character. I did read neither the novel, nor the manga, but how he is displayed in the anime is just ridiculously bad; the anime does not even want to do anything for the viewer to like the show’s main protagonist. He is you typical Japanese salaryman, who works too much and never gets the appreciation he deserves for his work. He is not needed, if he vanishes, no one will ever remember that there one day was a Japanese named Shingo Ichinomiya. <br />
<br />
Criticism <br />
I will not try to hide the fact that when the series began, I had quite big hopes for it. I mean, who would not? Just watch the first episodes and you will understand the hype. However, at some point, it just ends and you understand what this series is: it is your isekai story, you have seen 1000 of times already. Its storyline does not give way too many answers for it to make just a bit of sense. Both main characters, as well as supporting characters are just plain boring and it gets even worse, when the show gets harem elements and becomes kind of a romcom than anything else.<br />
<br />
All in all, a huge disappointment. The show did have an amazing start, it was interesting, I wanted to keep watching it and was looking forward for every episode. And then the series tries to be everything and fails in that miserably. Would I recommend this show to anyone? Probably not. Only if you cannot live without ‘isekai series’, or are ‘gotta watch them all’, the completionist type of an anime fan.<br />
<br />
5/10; not recommended.

    While I cannot give anything away, this show did something that it is gonna make the enjoyment of this show go way down hill, and make anything after it not as impactful as they&#039;re indending to be. However I will say that it does seem to be getting better as it goes along. But again, that start really hurt it for me.<br />
<br />
The story takes an interesting twist, with instead of just going to a new world as you in a new world, or someone of your same age, they are instead gone to a new world as a little kid of all things. Which is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336814">
        a nice twist, as it&#039;d be cool to see him grow. It just fails to have a better impact due to how this show started.<br />
<br />
The characters themselves, some are alright, some are just plain and not interesting. As if they just needed to fill in names for story purposes, and then not go back to them later on. Or not show us if those plot points could be used. But who knows, maybe they will go into that in the future.<br />
<br />
Music and art is pretty ok. Only non bad thing I have to say about this show.<br />
<br />
All in all, the start of this show kinda killed it for me. Though it has gotten better as it&#039;s gone along. A hit or miss if you&#039;re interested.

    I have a weakness for isekai. This anime is an isekai. Therefore, I picked up this anime.<br />
<br />
Eight episodes in, however, I am dropping this anime. Although it had a promising start, and contrary to my expectations of it based on the light novel which &quot;Hachi-nan tte, Sore wa Nai deshou!&quot; is sourced from, this anime is complete and utter garbage.<br />
<br />
<br />
==spoilers ahead==<br />
<br />
<br />
After the first major timeskip, the anime simply falls apart. Instead of focusing on the intrigue of Wendelin&#039;s family dynamic, or his impressive magical abilities, or the difficulties of high society, or anything else even remotely interesting, the anime introduces several weak characters not even

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340820">
        worth the character tropes they&#039;re based on. The anime then proceeds to skip around from scene to scene, causing each episode to feel like a highlights reel and mid-season recap than a single coherent episode.<br />
<br />
The straw which broke my back precipitated within episode eight, where my favorite genre ever, dungeon-core, was executed so poorly that I watched the episode mouth agape in abject horror of its awfulness.<br />
<br />
Just... do yourself a favor and don&#039;t watch this anime.<br />

    So far this anime seems to be fairly slow-going for isaki genre, but (I&#039;m only reviewing the anime) EP. 4 so for and the art work is top tier and the animation I personally love which is partially why i rated it so high as the story itself up to this point makes me want a lot more, and it doesn&#039;t throw boobs in your face like an ecchi. That being said it does seem to over do the visuals a lot leading to a slower plot development which is fine as long as it has a second season so if you like good artwork

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336848">
        and are okay with a little slower plot then this is for you.

    I Agree with the top reviewer and everyone else below. So I gonna add 1 thing, what this anime achieved what many other failed to.<br />
<br />
SPOILER ALERT:<br />
This MC is the one and only who&#039;d officially recognised his harem(!!), period. <br />
<br />
Also this could have been a non isekai anime so far. Since the MC failed to use any of his common sense from his earlier life. (I cannot say for sure, maybe the manga is much more enjoyable and carries out this task better.). He started to act like a child the moment he became one, there was no real transition.

    Sigh... Here we go again. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s really hard for us, hardcore isekai fans to defend the genre when shows like this get an adaptation. It would hurt nobody if it stayed in the abyss of mangaland with its fanbase but they had to bring it to animeland. As a manga reader I can tell you this show is bad and it doesn&#039;t get better. It&#039;s like a different version of Kenja no Majo.<br />
<br />
The premise as usual with those stories is interesting. You have an mc that gets isekai&#039;d in a medieval fantasyland but with a twist. He enters the body of the 5 years old

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339108">
        child of a lowly noble family somewhere in the countryside. From this point you have 2 options. The generic one or the creative one. I&#039;m sure you know by now which one the author chose.<br />
<br />
For the sake of it let&#039;s imagine the creative scenario. MC retained all his memories of the past and is now in this forsaken place. He then slowly starts to learn more about the world, cultures, and trade. Since he&#039;s a salary man he could even create a trading companies or manage his estate to make it prosper. Either way we would see a good worldbuilding with a somewhat op mc but just because he&#039;s smarter. He would win with guts and intellect and you can even give him some magic.<br />
<br />
*Spoiler*<br />
<br />
The lazy way which the author chose : Make mc super OP at birth and have some dude wander in a forest close by and make that dude somehow sense the mc&#039;s power and make him teach the mc all his magic because reasons. Then kill off that character and make the mc cry with some sad music to create fake empathy. Oh and let the MC remember how to make wasabi from his previous life and for the rest of the time let him act like a brat because why not. This story shouldn&#039;t even be an isekai, at least it wouldn&#039;t be added to the long list of trash isekai out there. He is just isekai for the sake of it. I&#039;m 100% sure the author made him an isekai character just because it&#039;s trendy. What&#039;s the point of being an Isekai mc if it doesn&#039;t serve any purpose at all?<br />
<br />
The sound in horrendous. What&#039;s with this voice acting and weird sound effects? Everything sounds so cheap and generic. It even felt like the sound was off sometimes it was irritating.<br />
<br />
All the characters without exception are boring. I usually like emotionless mcs but this one has just a punchable face. Did I mention that he didn&#039;t even have any goal at all? Like how you would look for ways to go back or at least try to understand how you arrived in that world since he wasn&#039;t summoned. But that&#039;s just brushed off by the author.<br />
<br />
I feel like this is a big middle finger to us. They are saying &quot;here your isekai story. Look the mc is super powerful you like that don&#039;t you? And look how everyone admires him, don&#039;t you wanna be like him? Check out all these chicks around him, see how cool and amazing he is&quot;. I&#039;m seriously annoyed because I really love isekai man but that&#039;s just too much. I had to let it out. <br />
<br />
And this f*$ù/ur doesn&#039;t have ANY will of his own. None whatsoever. It&#039;s infuriating.<br />
<br />
If you want to read good isekai, check out the manwha/manhua, they are at least somewhat better than this.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m out.<br />

    Hachi-nan tte, Sore wa nai deshou! looks to be your generically bland isekai show. But in contrast against those statements, we are looking to get a world-building concept show with little to no cliche/ecchi filler moments. The visuals may be a major turnoff for some but for others that love world building and plots &amp; twists should give this one a try.<br />
<br />
Story:  Shingo Ichinomiya, is a man that got isekai&#039;d randomly and is now living in a body of a toddler. This may be kinda random and probably stupid, but this is how the story goes. With no way to go back, he then

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336838">
        lives and grows up to live his own adventure. Finding new companions on the way, and overcoming troubles that may fall upon them with their adventures. Not much to say, but the only important aspect of this story is the journey. UPDATE** Looks like down the road, we will be dealing with a lot of politics so that is the world-building that we are gonna be looking at. 6/10<br />
<br />
Art: The art isn&#039;t all that great, but not bad either. It is just very generic looking with bland fantasy visuals. Putting aside the art, the animation isn&#039;t that great either. For the fight scenes, all that we are seeing really is moving png images fighting against cgi monsters and creatures. I wouldn&#039;t know if they are low on budget or if they are saving for later down the road, but it is just as generic as it gets. Update** Looks like the quality deteriorates over time as they butcher up the adaptation in order to finish this show. 4/10<br />
<br />
Sound: The sound isn&#039;t anything conspicuously bad, as I don&#039;t really impose any sentiments towards the sounds. On the other hand the music from the OP/ED gives off a very nostalgic feel like it&#039;s from the 2000s. The heavy metal opening and the majestic vibes it gives off to the viewers makes it very much prominent. For the ED the harmonies combined with the nonchalant singing feels very smooth and relaxing. I have to say they did a really good job capturing the vision for the light novel adaptation as in making the story feel as really immense as it is with this ost. 8/10<br />
<br />
Character: There&#039;s really nothing to say about these characters, because so far we don&#039;t really know any of the main casts background and for their reason to be on this journey. For the MC, he didn&#039;t seem to use his knowledge as a 25 year old and acted very much like a child when he got isekai&#039;d into a little boy which kinda p1ss some viewers off with this format. I believe even though he has lived 25 years, going back to being a little boy that is still developing brain growth will mean he wouldn&#039;t be able to keep all his knowledge. As for everyone else, they just seem to be there for the plot of world-building with very little much to add. I&#039;m sure in the future we will get some background with the MC&#039;s party, so we will have to wait until then. UPDATE** This world norms are way different than our because apparently having concubines is fine, and the wife doesn&#039;t even mind. The MC though isn&#039;t such a wuss as other protagonists as from judging by the novel, he does some pretty kinky stuff. 5/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I believe this may be a more interesting story down the line but with the cover of being generic as it seems, I can understand the major turnoff from people that demand more appealing works of animation.<br />
7/10<br />
Opinion: 6.8/10<br />
Overall Prediction: 6.42/10

    Hachi-nan tte, Sore wa Nai deshou!<br />
<br />
Repost and possible spoilers:<br />
<br />
The 8th son? Are you kidding me? or Hachi-nan tte, Sore wa Nai deshou!, basically another isekai themed anime......Yep say it &quot; Are you kidding me?&quot; Cu&#039;z , yes SynergySP, Shin-Ei Animation chose a light novel to have an anime adaptation as as expected it has all the cliches that every isekai anime has , TBH, not a lot of reviewer have any love for this anime. As for me this is how I see it:<br />
<br />
Story- fair 6: It maybe cliche , but ta least this anime&#039;s story plot has some silver lining in it where we

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354305">
        see sibling rivalry going around here , but still everything else was just too boring...<br />
<br />
Art- Decent 4: Don&#039;t be expecting any fanservices around here.<br />
<br />
Sound - Decent 4: No comment here.<br />
<br />
Character- Mediocre 5: Cu&#039;z we have the usual thing tha every isekai themed anime has, a Red Head in Hillenbrand, Ena Susanne, a bokuko in Yorande Aorelia Oufelbeik, Louise a strong girl in von Asgahan, Wilma Etol, a loli in Elise and some retainers guys like von Arnim, Elvin and Rhoderich a old timer like Ringstat, Blanctag, what more can you ask for, given that climaxes were too predicable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- Poor 3: Poor as it may, I still find this enjoyable given that there wasn&#039;t a situation where the harem wasn&#039;t competing for the guy.<br />
<br />
Overall- Dreadful 2: Cu&#039;z it was just cliché anime with a an isekai theme, and also let&#039;s not forget that the Mc was able to have all his cake and eat it too.

    The 8th son? Are you kidding me? More like it gets shitter every episode? Are you kidding me?<br />
<br />
In truth, I actually enjoyed this anime a lot and was planning to give it a solid 10/10 if it continues with its chill, tranquil, relaxing pace. But sike! It just gets worse and worse and worse up until the point where I could just spit on my laptop&#039;s screen and won&#039;t bother to wipe it out to leave a mark of disgust for such a shit show this is. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ll tell you. I have a thing or two for isekai but this show is just shit. There&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review343840">
        barely anything fun and it just becomes more gay and full of cliche ass as the story progresses. Up until the point where it&#039;s just not fun to watch anymore.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t bother watching this piece of shit. I&#039;m out, and if you&#039;re watching it right now you should quit too. This is worse than your average dose isekai. It&#039;s more like you&#039;re being forced to eat plain rice alone until you get bored of it.

    *Warning: This review contain some spoilers to explain how I rate this anime*<br />
<br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t read any LN or other source materials of the anime so I will not give any bias towards it as I only have seen the anime. also I made this after watching 11 episodes so far<br />
<br />
first of all, is this worth watching? <br />
straight answer, NO<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 2/10<br />
It started with a good episode 1 and it showed some promise, even if the setting is generic isekai one. However, the build up and the story on next episodes are confusing and dreadful to watch. I think most of the anime should care about how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review343444">
        they would transition from one scene to another but this anime didn&#039;t do it, they rushed the story and they would insert random scene who knows where they got it and start on a new scene right after. <br />
<br />
(This Paragraph contain spoilers)**  But still, the story is bearable until when we got to episode 10 and 11, the king suddenly wanted to make a discord between the brothers and make wendelin the heir, they spout some grand nonsense about developing the land while doing nothing for all these years and kept the people and the region poor, I mean if you wanted to fix the problem you would start dealing the actual problem instead of shifting the blame, why did I say so? it is because the region is poor to begin with even the lord have to work coz of the poverty over the entire region and yet the king and the palace didn&#039;t bother helping or invest on them, so who is in fault here? the lord or the king? yes the king and now he will kill 3 birds with one stone; (1) the blame will be on the heir instead of his, (2) he wanted to make wendelin the heir and have him invest on the land with his money, (3) he will be the one to reap the rewards after the region became good. At first look nothing is wrong there, the people wanted a better leader and wendelin with his assets can improve the land right? But no, first is why did the heir became that shit? It is because the king plotted a plot to provoke him by using wendelin, and the second and the biggest reason is if the king or the country itself have the money to pay for wendelin &quot;great&quot; achievements then WHY did they not invest that &quot;money&quot; on the land for all these years<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
It&#039;s pretty decent and good for most parts. The CGI is kinda bad tho, they could&#039;ve made it better. <br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
I don&#039;t have any complaints or issues about the sound, it&#039;s kinda good.<br />
<br />
Character: 1/10<br />
Character? what is character? tbh if we have 0 here I would have rated it 0/10. The other characters have been written poorly and the mc build up have potential but it all gone to waste. Why? in short, the mc is still a spineless kiddo like in episode 1 who can&#039;t even decide for himself<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3/10 <br />
I still enjoyed the first parts of the series while not bothering the bad things. the first part was still bearable and still kinda fun but the latter is written poorly and it&#039;s so hard to enjoy it. <br />
<br />
Overall: 3/10 <br />
I think the anime is rushed plus the story is poorly written, the character development was there but it was disappointing, they could made it better but they didn&#039;t bother to do soI usually do not dis any anime that I don&#039;t like and not watch it, but I had watched this anime and as I said it was disappointing. I gave it a chance but it all went downhill.<br />
<br />
If you wanted to watch action, adventure, fantasy or even generic isekai then as I said, it is not worth watching. why did they even bother to adapt this? there are far more generic isekai anime to watch or even manga/manwha/LN to adapt that are still better than this. or better yet go read some other manga,manwha or LN instead of this one.

    This anime has alot of potential.<br />
<br />
I will try my best to not give out any spoiler.But this anime really has alot of potential of being a really good isekai anime.Personally im a very big fan of isekai with overpowered main character.But im fine with normal isekai like rezero.<br />
<br />
Story: The starting of this anime is cringy.An adult man(an office worker) after his reincarnation to the ISEKAI world loses his maturity which really cringe me off and considering his behavior it does not look like an acting and he is actually childish.<br />
Despite that,he tends to act like that till he joined the adventure school.<br />
<br />
The story concept is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336904">
        really good but due to the character personality and behavior it made it quite tough for me to watch.As of now im still on episode 4 and still waiting for the next episode.Maybe i will give a higher rating if the anime goes uphill instead of going downhill like the past few episodes which i didnt really enjoy.<br />
<br />
From a few reviews i saw,people have a similiar about this anime like me and I really did expect that.<br />
<br />
Art-wise:it does not have anything special and it looks like a pretty decent anime but If possible i would like a unique twist to it but oh well<br />
<br />
Character: C R I N G Y despite being given a large amount of power and a very good spell set.His character aint half bad but there were so improvement from his young self to his teenage self despite being alone for sometime.Pretty unrealistic for me.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:I enjoyed his character being overpowered but other than that nothing else.<br />
<br />
Overalll:I would give it a 4 but maybe more or less depending on the rest of the episodes but let me say this here that this has alot of potential and it has a lot of time for it to develop it is up to the writer to increase the popularity of this show.<br />
<br />
as of now its like 6.5/10 on MAL which is not a really good score for anime like this but considering how this anime is turning out for the past few episodes i can definitely understand that.

    This is my first comment, I never really did it because I didn&#039;t consider that I had seen a lot of content to be able to do it, but finally I was encouraged.<br />
<br />
I am not going to be as extensive as I am not one of the people who tries to be elitist when it comes to anime and I do not analyze every fps of what I see, I just try to have a good time distracting myself, but that does not mean that I am going to see something of garbage.<br />
<br />
About the anime &quot;Hachi-nan tte, Sore wa Nai deshou&quot;, I can tell you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344311">
        that it is neither good nor bad, I know it is a very ambiguous way to describe it, but it is as it is, it has perfectly balanced strong and bad points to enjoy it without get bored; If I had to describe the strong point of this anime it would be the development of its characters and I personally like its designs and the negative would be that the action scenes are few or simply cut in the story; Some points that can be considered may be, which according to what is understood is not faithful to his novel, that is why he can see some things without depth.<br />
<br />
As soon as I finish watching the anime, I made this post, hope it helps you in something.

    Every season there are a few shows that go under the radar. For me, this season Hachi-nan tte was one of those shows. While it is nothing revolutionary or amazing, it is a solid watch and a pretty entertaining show.<br />
<br />
 It’s your usual isekai formula with a bit of a different take. The MC is reincarnated into another world as the 8th son of a poor noble family, meaning he basically has no rights to any of his family’s wealth or any sort of inheritance. He eventually works his way up and becomes your usual Isekai protag who is very OP. <br />
<br />
Where Hachi nan stands

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344293">
        out for me is that unlike most isekai, its primary focus is not on an MC going to defeat a demon lord or saving the day, but on the development and bonds formed with the rest of his party, side characters, etc. It’s a very character and relationship driven story, so even if you don’t usually like isekai, you may find this one enjoyable.  The art and animation are also top notch as the studio who were in charge of this are behind the legendary Doraemon series as well as Takagi san, therefore production quality remains great throughout.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, while I appreciate the show’s attempt to world-build and develop characters, some  stretches of episodes just felt boring to me and did not offer anything to really hold my attention. I imagine some rather important bits of the story were probably omitted due to time constraints as well, which is typical for adaptations. <br />
<br />
As someone whose fave genre is isekai, I found this not disappointing, but not great either. However, it is well worth a watch in my opinion. Hachi nan gets 7 concubines out of 10 from me.
