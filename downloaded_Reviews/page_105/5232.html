    Initially my wtf is going on radar went off. The first episode threw me for an FLCL loop. As the story progresses you get more of a FLCL meets The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya feel that starts to develop along with Shafts amazing ability to throw art of the abnormal around.<br />
<br />
Story -<br />
Take a minute to read the Synopsis... That basically covers the first episode. Things start to get real in depth with the story later on. I would say Sasami heavily feels like a Haruhi in this aspect. She has this power that she thinks she doesn&#039;t have. She later has to learn how to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review89905">
        control it while trying to fend off abnormal aspects of her life just to be normal. This story can be a bit weird at times.. However its still developing.<br />
<br />
Art -<br />
Things are really unique in this category. Shaft put forth another amazing effort to make a unique anime. The graining they did on certain regions makes it stick out like crazy. The characters are cheeky, cute, and all around appealing. There is fan service to some degree but it doesn&#039;t feel terrible.. I guess more awkward sometimes. I really enjoyed this category the most.<br />
<br />
Sound-<br />
I don&#039;t have much to complain about here. The sound is normal. The ending themes are unique in a way. The opening is fairly good. My biggest gripe is probably just a few of the voice actors. Not everyone can always be fantastic. Kamiomi sounds to much like an old man at times. Then again it works every now and then.<br />

The character development is very... very weird at times. This story can just throw these characters for a loop. Every character has their own unique weirdness about them. If you think this story is heading in one direction, it travels in another. Without giving away spoilers i just ask myself WTF is going on at times.<br />

Enjoyment-<br />
Lets just say all the weird FLCL Melancholy loopyness with the fantastic art kept me watching episode after episode. I highly suggest a rewatch of episodes just to understand things a bit better. It&#039;s very enjoyable for what it is.

    Anime auteur Akiyuki Shinbo has with Studio Shaft directed a number of highly interesting, willfully off-kilter and generally amusing series. His work is always bold, with visual flair beyond the norm and he usually chooses to direct works with morbid or bizarre sensibilities and humor. Sasami-san@Gabaranai does not break the Shaft mold in the slightest, but it does reaffirm how well it can work. It&#039;s a very strange but thoroughly fun ride.<br />
<br />
Shaft&#039;s knack for good visuals keeps the series looking strong. Perhaps some of the tricks used are there to keep the costs down; it doesn&#039;t matter, the anime looks distinctive and often beautiful. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review98953">
        characters are attractive, the action fluid. The actors also play their parts well and the music is kept fittingly quirky. The opening theme is energetic and kinda catchy, though not quite as memorable as some Shaft themes. The ending theme sequences are kinda fun, and the song itself kinda cute. <br />
<br />
Sasami-san isn&#039;t just good on the technical end though, it also tells a wonderfully odd and interesting story. Going into the series, it&#039;s kind of hard to tell what it is at first. The first two episodes are really goofy and make it seem like another weird Shaft comedy (which it is to an extent). Then the third and fourth episode are just strange. The fifth episode is where it all gets pulled back some and we see earnest character development and the real clues that they might be taking this more serious than it first appeared. Then episode six comes and turns it all in on itself; where there was a ridiculous and bizarre school comedy with supernatural elements there is now a character driven supernatural adventure with an oddball sense of humor. What was at first diverting, whimsical fun becomes an actually evocative character piece.<br />
<br />
Character pieces need good characters and Sasami-san has great ones, though it doesn&#039;t seem so at first. Sasami herself is an odd character to figure out since she seems so weird and detached initialy. She&#039;s actually a strong, willful lead who grows as she comes to make new friends while being just quirky enough to make the comedy work. Her brother on the other hand, while seeming critical to the show at first does not get developed very much, yet he does remain interesting and kind of fun for his silliness; he&#039;s a weirdo who does nothing of importance and seems only to be there to creep on his sister and get smacked around by the characters who matter. He hides his face, which adds mystery, but nothing of substance about him is particularly resolved.<br />
<br />
Aside from Sasami, the other real stars of the series are the three Yagami sisters. At first glance these are characters invented entirely for humor; you got a young girl with an adult body, an adult with a young girl&#039;s body and a robot girl. They do certainly lend themselves well to the madcap comedy of the series, but to my surprise they turned out to actually be characters as well. The adult-bodied child, Tama, is ridiculous but still comes across as a sweet, innocent child and also as an earnest, affecting and strong willed presence; she has some very strong scenes and becomes quite likable. Eldest sister Tsurugi meanwhile is cool and competent (while still being silly enough) and works in the mentor/guardian role. Middle sister Kagami is probably my favorite character though, as the arc involving her and Sasami&#039;s blossoming frienship is handled beautifully and in a way that makes it gratifying to see her open up. She&#039;s also amusing and her fight sequences are always cool.<br />
<br />
Beyond the main cast, Sasami-San has a small number of other interesting characters,mostly serving as antagonists. Sasami&#039;s mother is a standout and the arc spent with her is an exciting one. The show isn&#039;t left much time to develop the antagonist for the last little arc, but it convincingly builds her relationship with Sasami and succeeds in making her a fun and interesting enough character. A few other noticeable characters don&#039;t get a chance to do much, which makes one wonder if sequels are planned. Given Shaft&#039;s record, it&#039;s certainly possible and for me at least would be welcomed.<br />
<br />
Sasami-san is an interesting show to follow. It switches between moods a lot and perhaps it seems a little scattered and weird for the first third. Depending on anime tastes it might be impenetrable or it might just be flat unfunny for some, but, for me, as it kept going it became a thorough delight. Is it another perfect 10 masterwork from the director who brought us Madoka Magica? No, but falling short of that mark--and with excellent style, humor and well defined characters--isn&#039;t really failing at all.

    In a dull season plagued by the predictable, describing this newest series as &quot;different&quot; would be a severe understatement. Enter Sasami-san@Ganbaranai, the front-runner for absurdity—playing the seductress, the shrew, the madwoman fueled by crack cocaine. Be forewarned. This is a genuine concoction of the bizarre, lacking any sense of direction, and indeed, having no concern for it. Sheer bewilderment becomes Sasami-san&#039;s very forte. Yet, this eccentricity is a double-edged sword, and considering the shallowness of Sasami-san&#039;s loony design, we&#039;re unfortunately left with a show that is plain disappointing.<br />
<br />
Both a strength and a weakness, the plot is all over the place. In the first episode for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review127055">
        example, Sasami spends her idle time stalking her brother from home via some unexplained form of ultra-computer technobabble, mixing in Haruhi references (oh the boldness) on the way; then Sasami purchases some Valentine&#039;s Day chocolate for her brother, which suddenly transforms the world into...chocolate. Now if this weren&#039;t enough, we have some wacky screenplay done in eroge style, a whole 30 seconds spent watching Sasami undress; cue jazz-fusion music, concurrent with tumultuous action scenes: missile-endowed breasts, chocolate dragons, magical powers, mechanical wings, and sensual cannibalism—all to save the world from becoming a permanent Willy Wonka factory.<br />
<br />
While we&#039;re offered nothing of the underlying plot, we&#039;re so bemused by its over-the-top direction, disoriented into excitement by the story and art direction&#039;s compounded nonsense. Yet, the underlying problem is that we&#039;re offered nothing related to the real plot. Instead we&#039;re served a bowl of shallow eccentricity, leaving a cloyingly sour taste as we&#039;re still wondering what the heck is going on (!).<br />
<br />
This is a real shame given that some of the more unique eccentricities are intrinsically linked to the Shinto doctrine. Sasami&#039;s brother Kamiomi perpetually hides his face under the presence of his sister, a testament to the humility of servants under deities; and the brooding incest between the two—while a common SHAFT delicacy—is canonically supported by the historical myths behind Shinto creationism. These are the occasional subtleties, the acts of brilliance overshadowed by heavy-handed symbols and writing: Sasami&#039;s mother inserting an awfully phallic totem into her daughter&#039;s stomach, festering into tangible bloat, and then Sasami birthing her own mother through some Freudian version of catharsis. Better yet, Takamagahara mythology even details this very method as the cycle of creation.<br />
<br />
Am I overreaching somewhere? Yes, a bit. Unfortunately, Sasami-san clouds itself with so many absurdities (much of the time for fanservice) that it becomes impossible to determine what actually warrants in-depth discussion. It would be too convenient to suppose all of it is just pandering eroticism, especially with the more detailed source material in mind. Yet, this potential existence for merit does not make Sasami-san&#039;s diluted symbology any more comprehensible from the start, overshadowed by the show&#039;s refusal to expand upon its elusive—and unfortunately, fleeting—strengths.<br />
<br />
At the show&#039;s core we&#039;re left with nothing but soppy melodrama—a direction that the show initially tried to avoid. This is where Sasami-san truly unhinges itself. While once entranced by the subtleties within the Shinto doctrine, the story takes a jarring left turn, yanking us out of the rabbit hole and placing us into a different tale: one of happiness versus responsibility, an introspective battle between Sasami&#039;s self-indulgent desires and her shrine maiden duties. Yet, the story forgets what previously distinguished Sasami-san, substituting eccentricity for intense manipulation (and boy is it an emotional roller coaster). Spending time with a zombie mother, only to be handled with a glop of melodrama by the end, simply does not compute. To have such a jarring turn of events (and an awfully serious one at that) alienates viewers from any meaningful connection to the characters.<br />
<br />
This dramatic venture is only exacerbated as many of the events are unnaturally spontaneous, pulling away from any sense of realism in the story. These are the scenes full of hilarious spunk when the show doesn&#039;t take itself seriously, but when deus ex machina are integrated with the drama, it&#039;s difficult to consider any of it to be sincere writing. How unfortunate that the only savior from a time-traveling golem (which just happens to have waited an entire decade in hibernation) is some awkward plot device tantamount to going Super Saiyan.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the narrative lends no favors to the cast either, as all the intriguing characters are offered little substance beneath their eccentric guises. Sasami Tsukuyomi is a hikikomori who also happens to be something of a goddess, and is queerly characterized by opposites: antisocial hikikism and a gooey moe personality. Sadly, her character is inconsistent, and constantly swaps between the two at the flick of a switch, a poor trait for a lead character aiming to pull off realistic drama. As for other cast members, Kamiomi plays the lustful brother, Tsurugi the frivolous red-head, Kagami the cold-hearted robot, and Tama the well-endowed moeblob with the brain age of a nymphet. While we are offered the occasional dynamic cleverly (word)played among these personalities, it is regrettable then that they never amount to anything more than that; the plot simply refrains from developing them past farcical melodrama. Moreover, the show even introduces more quirky characters three-quarters of the way through its 12 episodes, which only seems to confirm that the writers are looking more for gimmicky shells than ripened fruit.<br />
<br />
In the end, Sasami-san concludes as the devil child that it is. The show&#039;s dynamics lends itself into an air of ravenous hilarity, pumping out the rare cheekiness reminiscent of more successful shows of its kind. But unfortunately, Sasami-san is so all over the place, and weighed down by its bloated melodrama, that these breadcrumbs are unsavory—ephemeral loaves expanding into excessively sour ones. Worth the watch? LSD&#039;s better.<br />

    For many, the first episode is like candy they&#039;ve never tried before. They may like it, they may not, or they may not be accustomed to the taste so they give it another shot. If you fall into the latter, you will find that Sasami-san is more than meets the eye.<br />
<br />
With its combination of supernatural occurrences, mysterious story line, unknown depth of characters, and extremely weird chain of events, you&#039;re not sure where the producers SHAFT is going with this. However, each episode contains enough elements to pique your interest, leaving you with a sense of longing and desire to see the next episode.<br />
<br />
Story -

          <span style="display: none;" id="review86603">
        6<br />
In its confusion, the first episode only gives you a brief glimpse into what Sasami-san is about. In general, there is very little explanation on what is happening. This is surprisingly concealed well by the events that take place, and is more so left up to the viewer to determine how the story unfolds and expands. Overal, the story is fair, not bad, not great.<br />
<br />
Art - 7<br />
I believe the art and animation to be on par with what SHAFT produces. I am not picky on watching anime based solely on that quality, though I have to admit there are scenes that could be drawn in more or higher detail. Overall, it is good, not exceptional.<br />
<br />
Sound - 9<br />
The atmosphere and setting play a large part in the general mood of Sasami-san; this includes the sound quality and background music. SHAFT does a great job in matching the music to the scene. The OP and ED reflect the series well, hinting at times the suspense, and at times the comedy and joking nature of the characters.<br />
<br />
Character - 8<br />
Each character has a unique personality, separate from the others in the series. Sasami-san would lose a lot of its interest if the characters were similar or bland. You will find immediately that each character adds something to the story, even if it&#039;s comedic relief or bizarre plot device.<br />
<br />
That being said, these arch-types are common across anime; you have the sleepy, half-closed-eyes character that&#039;s lazy and unwilling to do anything physical, and you have the short, witty-comebacks character that views life as a joke. At the very least, SHAFT try to do something new with already-used character traits.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 7<br />
As I said previously, each week I find myself watching the anime out of interest, and not for the sake of &quot;completing the series&quot;. This is because the story slowly develops, albeit slow and confusing at times. You&#039;re left guessing and making predictions on the plot and where it&#039;s going, so if that&#039;s not something you want to do, then you may find yourself dropping this anime. I for one believe that watching with no expectations is best, as you may be left pleasantly surprised at the end.<br />
<br />
Overall -7<br />
Sasami-san@Ganbaranai is by no means the perfect anime, and many will detest the direction (if it is heading in one) that SHAFT is taking with it. However, there are elements that make Sasami-san interesting; there are bizarre, supernatural events that unfold; some very neat action animation sequences and battles; and an array of characters that play into your senses just enough. Sasami-san, Ganbare!

    I recently had the pleasure of rewatching Sasami-san@Ganbaranai, and I think my view on this show is now more balanced than it used to be. I loved every episode save for the last three, and wanted to see if I would feel the same way again. Was Sasami-san@Ganbaranai as good as I thought it was? Read on to find out.<br />
<br />
Now, I noticed this the first time I watched it, and it’s worth pointing out: the show isn’t deep. Though the story uses a lot of lore from Japanese mythos, it’s just a backdrop and reason for everything that happens in the show. Maybe it takes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review131345">
        a few liberties with its source, and maybe it’ll annoy Japanese mythos junkies, but that would be missing the show’s true focus: a simple story about Sasami the shut-in as she’s watched by the three Yagami sisters—Tsurugi, Kagami, and Tama—to stop her God-like power from making mass chaos in the world. With entertaining results.<br />
<br />
Cities will turn to chocolate, video games will come to life, clones will run loose, vengeful spirits will arise, and that’s only the problems Sasami makes, and not the chaos caused by the people protecting her and the people who want to use her.<br />
<br />
But no matter how insane the story gets, it never break its own rules. If a weapon is described as being defensive, the way it shatters another weapon is very clever. If God-like power is useless against one character but strong against three others, it’s because that one character has anti-God abilities. If a character’s power is inconsistent, it’s from a lack of experience using it. Save for one line of dialog, the consistency in the setting’s in-universe rules is perfect; quite a feat considering how easily an insane show like this can break them.<br />
<br />
The story’s progress is solid in the first nine episodes thanks to its decent characters. Sasami doesn’t have much in the way of personality, but her story of responsibility VS freedom is handled well. The reasons for her being a shut-in make sense when thinking about her back story, though it can be hard to catch from the show’s insanity. On the other hand, her bad friend-making skills make sense since she’s a shut-in, though her friendship with Kagami and a later character is rushed.<br />
<br />
Kagami herself starts as the show’s resident quiet girl, but soon shows a lot of emotion, smiling and snarking and showing embarrassment this way and that. Unfortunately, the rushed friendship with Sasami can make Kagami hard to take seriously, especially in the show’s last three episodes where Kagami’s back story is explained a bit more, but that back story never comes to play in full force. On the other hand, what she deals with in her spotlight episode is a sign of the story’s growing seriousness.<br />
<br />
But the story’s serious side starts with Tsurugi. She starts as the pervert but becomes the protector, the mentor of sorts to Sasami, and the Yagami Sister’s de-facto leader. She doesn’t have much in the way of development, but her role in the story doesn’t need it. It just needs personality. And it’s a personality that’s believably serious when it shows itself for the first time in an early episode, considering who Tsurugi is. Starting with her serious side, the show moves nicely from light-hearted to serious in the first several episodes, even as the show’s insanity rises.<br />
<br />
That said, the last sister, Tama, causes two bad scenes in the show. The first scene being after the show gets really serious, where she starts talking about her bond with Tsurugi, Kagami, and Sasami, except none of what she says makes any sense at all, because the show never shows the crucial part of what she’s talking about. The second scene is in the climax of the first several episodes, where a chance to develop her character meaningfully is wasted for humor. Otherwise, she’s little more than a childlike plot device.<br />
<br />
Despite that, the show moves well in the first nine episodes, shaky character development aside, though after the first several episodes there are two things about the story that make no sense; no, the show doesn’t break its own in-universe rules, but it involves Sasami, Tsurugi, and a new character.<br />
<br />
The first problem is the new character, and no, this isn’t the one Sasami befriends. Anyway, this new character has a big role in the story, a believable relationship with Sasami, and quite a bit of personality. This is all well and good, but her behavior after the first several episodes is such a big change from what she was before, it’s jarring; Tsurugi hints to the reason for this, but that’s all it is. A hint.<br />
<br />
The second problem is the kind of hot potato game Sasami, Tsurugi, and the new character have. At one point it looks like one character will carry it, then it looks like another character will carry it until the other character is ready to take it, then it turns out it’s this character who carries it. Confused yet? So am I. But these two story problems are nothing compared to the mess of the last three episodes, and no, the show still doesn’t break its own rules and it never does.<br />
<br />
The problem with the last three episodes is it makes no sense, even for a show as insane as this. To explain, it’s a world domination plot by a new character—the one who Sasami befriends—and her reason for this plot makes no sense. Second, this character knows the second story problem, so it makes even less sense for her to bring in Sasami and the Yagami Sisters. The last three episodes are a mess, but at least the insanity continues to rise with the music and visuals to carry it.<br />
<br />
The music would be better if I counted the opening song, Alteration, but I’m not. The in-show music isn’t anything that can stand on its own, but it does deserve credit for its variety. It uses—or at least, sounds like it uses—the flute, piano, fast techno, epic orchestra, guitar, game show, elevator, blues, suspense chords, jazz, uplifting; it throws everything at the show. And while it doesn’t have a unique identity, the chaotic music lends itself to the show’s insanity, though not at as well as the visuals.<br />
<br />
The character designs are brightly colored and their faces are expressive, especially with Tsurugi and Kagami. The abstract backgrounds, such as Sasami’s room, stand out because of how scarce they are compared to the normal backgrounds. Strangely enough, most of the show’s chaos happens in the normal backgrounds, making the well-animated chaos stand out even more. The music and visuals carry the insanity, which I know is a word I’ve used a thousand times here, but there’s something crucial about it I need to mention.<br />
<br />
While the show’s insanity is one of its main strengths, it can also be one of its flaws. To explain, it can be hard to look past the show’s chaos to find any substance, and the substance is a good if flawed story, but that might not be enough for some people. To put it another way, watching this show makes people choose between two options: finding a good if flawed story, or letting themselves be whisked away by the show’s insanity.<br />
<br />
Of those two options, I first watched this show with the second choice. I remember being wowed by all of the chaos, and called the story and character development unlike nothing I’ve ever seen. But as I might have pointed out, rewatching it made me see it wasn’t as good as I thought it was. That said, I will say with all my heart that I still personally LOVE Sasami-san@Ganbaranai, but this show is definitely a few motivations short of being @the top.

    An excellent lesson of Japanese mythology presented in the form of a lazy girls attempt at a normal life. The story follows Tsukuyomi Sasami which I&#039;m sure you thought was a normal girl at first glance but it turns out she has quite the story in her past which she is trying to bury inside her. I was impressed by the nonchalance which some characters in the series treat problems.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed it very much due to the fact that I am a fan of history and Japan&#039;s history is a subject of great interest to me as well as its mythology which I knew nothing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review91735">
        until I&#039;ve watched this series and found out a lot of fascinating things by doing some research.<br />
<br />
I will say this, its a very complex series for those of you with a slim attention span. It has comedy scenes, fighting scenes as well as interesting forms of mythology interpretation.<br />
I reckon people who have read some books in their lives should have no problems following the storyline(I meant no offense).

    Short version: WTF is going on...with sort of a reason.<br />
<br />
Long version: Story is revolved around the life of a high school girl who is a NEET with the powers of god. There are other characters in the story however they are briefly or not developed at all. Some people may find it funny due to the fact that there is some serious WTF in every episode. However that is all the anime is. Mostly a bunch of random events  jumbled together caused by the powers of the high school girl.<br />
<br />
If you watch Gintama you just might find it worthwhile to watch, and don&#039;t quote

          <span style="display: none;" id="review85913">
        me on this cause Gintama is the only thing i can think of that is closest to this.

    Following the massive successes of the Madoka and Monogatari franchises, Shaft found itself a sizable new fanbase, awaiting with bated breath, eager to bear witness to their next big hit.  This eagerness was answered with the adaption of the light novel Sasami-san@Ganbaranai.  Were these new fans sated by their new weekly dosage of still frames and headtilts?  Let’s just say that these fans are still holding their breaths.  Unfortunately for Shaft, the reception was quite the contrary.  To call Sasami-san merely a disappointment would be an unforgivable understatement.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the main problem of Sasami-san, much like Hataraku Maou-sama, is that it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review127203">
        suffers from an enormous identity crisis.  Is it an ecchi comedy?  Is it an introspective commentary on hikkikomori shut-ins?  Is it a dark, plot-centric epic battle between the gods?  All and none of the above.  There are certainly points where it tries to be humorous and then inexplicably and suddenly decides to take itself seriously and somehow expect us to do so as well, particularly during the mother arc.  And, occasionally, it will mix the two—rather inappropriately, I might add.  As just one example, the art and animation shifts into a comedic style during what was supposed to be the tense, climactic finale.  If this show was more decisive and chose SOME direction with the plot, either as a full-blown ecchi comedy or a dark and edgy conflict of gods and secret organizations, it would have fared much better.  Some shows can handle having serious elements sprinkled with comedic relief, but Sasami-san clearly showed an utter incapacity to do so.<br />
<br />
Like most Shaft works, the art is consistently inconsistent.  At times I cannot help but marvel at the sheer beauty and creativity of the way some things are portrayed, such as the light filtering in Sasami’s room which makes it look like it’s done entirely by watercolors (I’m a sucker for Shaft backgrounds); yet, I can’t help but laugh at the utterly lazy and uninspired art and animation that occasionally found their way into some scenes.<br />
<br />
This brings me to my next point: the characters.  While the character designs themselves are not necessarily bad, I would not call them “good,” either.  Most look average at best, while the worst offenders are dull blobs.  Not only are characters superficially unremarkable, but the personalities underneath are nothing to write home about either.  You can immediately guess the personality of each character simply by their designs.  Some might consider this to be a success; however, I disagree in this case because, frankly, the personalities are disappointingly stale.  Most characters are not original or interesting in the least, almost every single one being a generic rehash of established archetypes we see in every other anime.  If you can predict a character’s every decision simply because of a strict adherence to their archetype, something is wrong.  Beauty is not merely skin deep here.<br />
<br />
Sasami-san is a show easily forgotten with virtually nothing special about it.  It makes me worry about Shaft&#039;s upcoming attempt at the manga Nisekoi.  Will it become a Monogatari, or will it, like Sasami-san and Dance in the Vampire Bund, join Shaft’s ranks of mediocre anime adaptions?  Let’s cross our fingers and hope it’s the former.

    May contain spoilers. <br />

Sasami-san@Ganbaranai/Sasami-san@unmotivated is about Sasami Tsukuyomi, a 16-year old shut-in who relies heavily on her brother, Kamiomi Tsukuyomi who has an intense love for her, exceeding that of sibling love. The story revolves around them, and the three Yagami sisters: Tsurugi,  Kagami and Tama.<br />
<br />
Now, when I watched the first two episodes, I was like &quot;What the f*ck is happening?&quot; I mean, everything turning into chocolate? A 30-year old woman in a kid&#039;s body wielding a sword? A cyborg? A hot 9-year old that can jump real high and stuff? It&#039;ll really put you in a situation where you don&#039;t know what is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review94779">
        going on. Now some of you might drop it after the first episode. But don&#039;t.It gets better, and eventually everything makes sense. <br />
<br />
Apparently, Sasami holds the power of Amaterasu in her body, and has the ability to alter everything around her according to her liking. And the Yagami sisters are gods as well. Tsurugi was originally Amatersau who passed down her power to a distant ancestor of Sasami. Kagami was a fallen god who was turned into a cyborg and later on raised by Tsurugi. And Tama is a new generation god made by Tsurugi.<br />
<br />
But some parts didn&#039;t make any sense. <br />
<br />
I liked the story.  It didn&#039;t make any sense at first, but as it goes, you&#039;ll start understanding what&#039;s going on. And I liked the characters too. I like how perverted Tsurugi is. And how silent-tsundere Kagami is. But I have to say my favorite is Kamiomi because of his mysterious background and lively nature.<br />
<br />
I have to say  that the art was...different from other anime I&#039;ve seen. Different in a good way. It almost had a water color-like feel to it and I was really mesmerized by it. Animation was smooth and had no signs of dropped quality anywhere. There&#039;s nothing special to point out about the sound. Though it is a little funny when the ending song starts. (Find out yourself ;D) <br />
<br />
Sasami-san@Ganbaranai gets a 9 from me because, even though I didn&#039;t understand anything at first, and despite having some parts no making sense at all,  everything made sense later on and will make you ask for more and wonder what&#039;ll happen next. You might drop it at first, but I advice that you don&#039;t. Trust me. You won&#039;t regret it.

    If you like SHAFT at their best, you should be very happy with Sasami-san@Ganbaranai. The first two-three episodes have Excel Saga levels of weirdness, but after that the bizarro factor tapers off rapidly and the story jells into coherence. By about halfway through the series you find yourself wrapped up in a coherent story that is simply a modern interpretation of Japanese mythology, with only slight sojourns into the unconventional (but all in the name of presenting the &quot;fantastic&quot; i.e. a story of gods). <br />
<br />
In other words, this anime is much more straightforward than FLCL, which it gets compared to a lot; just watch more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review92155">
        than the first few episodes and it will all fall into place. You only need to watch Sasami-san@Ganbaranai once through to understand what it is about; peeling back one layer of the onion that is this anime reveals all it&#039;s secrets, unlike FLCL where the onion is many layers deep and takes a lot more effort to reveal it&#039;s depths. That doesn&#039;t mean that Sasami-san@Ganbaranai is shallow, though, just not as full of obscure analogies and almost-opaque references. The viewer need not be acquainted with Japanese mythology to any great degree in order to interpret the show and enjoy it.<br />
<br />
The art style is great, suiting the theme of the story perfectly, and the sound is perfect as well ( I love the way they use one particular piece of jazzy guitar music with someone singing &quot;lalala&quot; to set a laid-back dreamy mood). <br />
<br />
I am puzzled as to why this anime is so underrated; do people really prefer meaningless battles and endless filler arcs to great art like Sasami-san@Ganbaranai? Anime would be a stale artform if we didn&#039;t get shows like this every so often.

    I decided to give this series a 6 overall, initially it was a 5 after finishing the last episode. The show should have ended after the Mom arc, it had great progression and the anime could have ended off on a better note. <br />
<br />
Instead they decided to continue and introduced a new character. Hardly anything is explained and a lot of the characters are not fleshed out very well. The last episode was a mess, do to a rushed end and troll subs (which were annoying btw). Not to mention more random characters and unanswered questions in the last episode. Even if the series was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review91723">
        going for weird and eccentric it could have done it far better, with actual story progression. <br />
<br />
The art was good for the most part, I enjoyed the scenery, and while the soundtrack didn&#039;t stand out to me at all it wasn&#039;t horrible. This series biggest hiccup is lack of progression, and constantly getting off track on what this anime is supposed to be about.

    Though not by any means amazing, Sasami-san@Ganbaranai certainly is an enjoyable, but quite strange series. While I find it difficult to categorize it into any particular genre, it could probably be best described as a comedic thriller.<br />
<br />
The first episode is a bit of a trip through madness, showing the main character, Sasami Tsukuyomi, spying on her pervert brother from home before the world inexplicably turns to chocolate, with three strange girls, the Yagami sisters, bringing things back to normal in a very over the top way. However, the first episode doesn&#039;t quite capture the true essence of this series, which reveals important details with each

          <span style="display: none;" id="review91337">
        episode that explain what the viewer has seen previously. <br />
<br />
The underlying theme is Sasami&#039;s desire to escape from supernatural obligation and live a more ordinary life. The story itself is fairly weak and felt a little a random or directionless at times, with events often resolved with deus ex machina plot elements,  but the characters are enjoyable and developed pretty well. There is a fair amount (though not overwhelming) of &quot;ecchi&quot; humour, as well as references to Shinto mythology and Japanese internet culture here, which some people will love, while others might feel lost watching this. <br />
<br />
Beyond all that, the art style is beautiful, with a very watercolour sort of design that sets it apart from most contemporary anime, along with character designs that really bring out the personality of each of the characters. The music is quite good, too, with a catchy opening theme by ZAQ, and the background music, while it isn&#039;t memorable, sets the mood well. The ending theme is mostly played for laughs, with off-key singing and commentary by various characters throughout almost the entirety of the series.<br />
<br />
Overall, I think that Sasami-san@Ganbaranai is a good watch, though not for everyone. If you&#039;re willing to overlook the aimless storyline and can appreciate the otaku elements though, you&#039;ll probably enjoy this series too.

    Sasami-san, is truly an underrated anime, in my opinion that is. I think Sasami-san is a... unique anime. Like the saying goes, &quot;don&#039;t judge a book by its cover&quot;, Sasami-san&#039;s first episode might leave you with mixed emotions.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Sasami-san is not what it really seems when you first watch it. Eventually, you&#039;ll see the events that happen each have a deeper meaning than what you first think of it. It&#039;s plot is indeed strange, yet intriguing. A lot of what happens also has to do with Japanese mythology. Depending on how well you know Japan&#039;s history (or maybe the amount of anime you watch), this show

          <span style="display: none;" id="review89131">
        may or may not be your cup of tea.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Honestly, I think Sasami-san&#039;s art is a bit strange...I haven&#039;t read the manga (or novel...whichever one was adapted) so I don&#039;t know if this is how the author intended the art to be. Despite this though, I do think that the art matches Sasami-san quite well. It might be because of its strange plot that the art matches it. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Sasami-san&#039;s opening is one of my favorites of Winter 2013. As for the ending, I&#039;ve never actually heard a legit version without people talking in the background so...can&#039;t really rate that. The seiyuu that plays Sasami does a pretty good job. I think it matches her really well.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
In here, I&#039;d say there are basically 5 main characters. First off, there&#039;s Sasami. I think her character development throughout the story is actually quite interesting to watch. She goes though many series of events that eventually builds up on her character. Then, there&#039;s her brother, Onii-chan. (That is what I will be referring him to as since that what&#039;s he&#039;s most commonly called on during the show). His character is quite plain. Most the time you&#039;ll only see him shouting out his love to Sasami. But there is the mystery of why he hides his face. Lastly, there is the Yagami sisters. Known as the &quot;gods&quot; they show somewhat of a character development throughout the show. I&#039;d say the youngest of the 3, Tamma, has the least character development, as of now. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I won&#039;t lie. I wanted to drop Sasami-san after the first episode. But I decided to give it a few more chances. And for some reason, every week, I started looking forward to watching it. Maybe it was the weird plot that drew me, or maybe it was just simply because I&#039;M weird, but I found that as I watched, I liked Sasami-san more and more.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Overall, Sasami-san shows lots of promise, but it probably started off on the wrong foot for most people. If your bored, this anime should keep you entertained. Now, once again, I shall repeat &quot;Don&#039;t judge a book by its cover!&quot;

    &quot;Sasami-san@Ganbaranai&quot; is something you don&#039;t see everyday. The manic, hybrid-fusion between Japanese mythology and niche, otaku neologisms. Despite the slathering-on of Studio Shaft&#039;s sensual sense of comedy, the light novel adaptation (originally written by the author, known as ※Akira) rivals NISIOISIN. Ameliorating common bishōjo tropes, to create a series full of twists, turns, and towering lore!<br />
<br />
※Akira is famously known for the writing the series, Kyōran Kazoku Nikki. The aforementioned series received an anime adaptation in 2008! <br />
<br />
⚠️ This review will be spoiler-free ⚠️<br />
<br />
—Story/Characters<br />
<br />
Usually Shaft Studios is hit-or-miss for me, but I feel that Mr. Shinbō&#039;s animation style suites it perfectly. I wasn&#039;t the biggest fan

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363981">
        of how Nomad adapted Kyōran Kazoku Nikki, but the otaku-humor and zaniness fits Shaft&#039;s approach to storytelling, like a tight glove! The progression of Sasami&#039;s character, from being a typical NEET (with a brother complex), is framed in a grander perspective—as the plot begins to thicken and her backstory comes to light. The revelatory context, about her family&#039;s enclosed community and how that warps Sasami&#039;s view-of-the-world is very disturbing, at first. By the end of the series, the finale makes the harsh reality easier to accept.<br />
<br />
There are clashes between deities, who make grandiloquent entrances, akin to the eccentric characters in the Monogatari series. Every character has a strong aura and a duplicity of traits and hang-ups! There&#039;s even a character that struggles with being intersex! To be more specific, she is what is referred to in Japan as a &quot;※hangetsu&quot; (半月, half-moon). All the while, Sasami is blissfully unaware of her own abilities.<br />
<br />
※In my &quot;Intersexuality in Anime&quot; essay, I go more in detail about this mythological trope. There&#039;s a karate technique with the same name, but it&#039;s also a term used to describe a person who changes genders, with the differing moon phases.<br />
<br />
Whether it be from a chocolate-covered dragon that is accidentally summoned, to the ghost of Sasami&#039;s deceased mother, to Kagami&#039;s detachable homing missiles... this show is very weird, but in a way that&#039;s palatable. Some issues that I have had with past scripts, that Shaft has adapted is, this: the experimental nature of series feel contrived. With Sasami-san@Ganbaranai, the avant-garde explorations feel exceedingly natural with the characters and setting. <br />

Commentary: &quot;Sasami-san@Ganbarenai&quot; has a pastel color palette, similar to series like &quot;Hidamari Sketch,&quot; there are also rotating facial reactions and visual references, akin to the likes of &quot;Bakemonogatari.&quot; The characters are distinctly vivacious and colorful, and the comedic-timing is always right on the mark. Is it even any wonder that Mr. Shinbō has accrued accolades in the industry for his unique style?<br />

* Two Car<br />
<br />
Commentary: Mr. Takayama is probably the weakest link, in the production. The biggest flaw in the series is the confusing composition of certain scenes. Perhaps, in this regard, &quot;Sasami-san&quot; should have been longer. The series composition often felt like it had entire novels crammed into a single episode. Episode 7 is one of the most egregious examples of this! There was so much information and dialogue in that one episode, that I had to rewatch it to understand what was going on in the plot.<br />

Commentary: Sasami&#039;s voice is very charming. As I said in my Black★Rock Shooter, she is an underrated gem in the industry. She has such a calming, normal, girl-next-door-kind of voice. Her characters are the type that you would want to have as either a friend or a little sister. Ms. Asumi is absolutely precious! Magnificent job!<br />

Commentary: Ms. Hanazawa is wonderful as Kagami. Although she&#039;s a deadpan tsundere/kūdere, she&#039;s easily one of the most lovable characters in the show! From what I read, Ms. Hanazawa earned the fan-nickname &quot;tenshi&quot; from playing this role, that would then extend to her part as Raphiel in Gabriel DropOut! One of the greatest seiyū-talents, in the industry!<br />

Commentary: Although Tama gets less attention and spotlight than the other heroines, Ms. Nonoka gives her a very cute, slightly guileless, voice! Great job!<br />
<br />
Conclusively, I would recommend this series to anyone who wants a series drenched with a contemporary take on Japanese deities, and doesn&#039;t mind the prevalence of ecchi in the narrative. Even with Shaft&#039;s definition of original, &quot;Sasami-san@Ganbaranai&quot; takes originality to a new level. Very slapstick, sometimes serious, occasionally geeky, with a milieu all its own! I give the series a solid 6/10!<br />
<br />

    Studio Shaft brings yet another unique artistic anime, that comes in the form of Sasami-san@Ganbaranai. Now, most people would shy away from even approaching this anime, due to its low average score below a 7. However, for a random anime I picked up due to the small hype that ran among my friends, going in expecting nothing comes out with something that is a hidden gem within the many piles of anime that are released every season.<br />
<br />
Sasami-san begins with, most simply defined, an unclear plot. The first two episodes are, simply said, extremely random. However, as a plot eventually develops, one discovers that the plot,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review102427">
        although with some focus about sasami&#039;s growing into society, is more random than the first two episodes. But it is extremely difficult to explain without revealing too much.<br />
<br />
The art, as expected by shaft, is again, amazing and unique. If you, the viewer, has seen anything by shaft, dont expect too much less, as the animation is top notch and unique as always. However, dont expect it to be as stylish and fancy as its most popular animes, such as Madoka.<br />
<br />
The sound is what got me the most. The OP i thought was great, and the ED i thought was absolutely amazing (when completely sung ;)). The anime also has a long list of popular voice actors, such as Kana Hanazawa. I thought the voice for Kamiomi was also extremely unique and hilarious.<br />
<br />
Most charecters in the anime are unique to an extent, but sadly most can be explained with one to a few sentences, as if you look at the charecter profiles not much can be said about them. But, as the phrase goes, &quot;There are no small parts, only small actors&quot;, and these charecters execute their charecters so that the anime is extremely enjoyable. Kagami breaks free of the stereotypical dandere, and Tsurugi and Kamiomi, although in completely different scenarios, really manage to bring a great amount of hilarity to the anime, and although neither tends to have much of a part in the main story, they really bring a smile to your face whenever you see them appear again, just wondering on what their next escapade will bring.<br />
<br />
The highest enjoyment of the anime is most definitely, the comedy. Sasami-san is extremely funny at times, especially with the unique charecter personalities and how they interact with each other and the rest of the world. The plot also leaves much room to create comedy, as the anime mainly focuses on comedy and completes its goal.<br />
<br />
For an extremely lowly rated anime (the lowest one i have ever seen), I was suprised at how much i actually enjoyed Sasami-san@Ganbaranai, especially with the fair share of unique charecters. But, because of the randomness and dis-focus of the plot, I can give it an 8. However, if i ever have the time again, I would love to pick up the anime again and rewatch it, just to get some nice laughs and hear that great ED.

    Hey folks, this will be a review for Sasami-san@Ganbaranai. Unfortunately this wasn&#039;t very interesting to me. In fact it was very dull, not very Shafty, nor as wtf inducing as other reviewers would have you believe.<br />
<br />
The story revolves around Sasami who holds the power of the the ultimate god which basically can control other gods. However this power backfires a lot(world turns to chocolate), also seems to be rather weak or non existent when in a pinch(other gods pick fights with her). Whether or not you take this show at face value like I am, or take it to be some wild illusion as the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220457">
        base synopsis hints at, your enjoyment and understanding of the show will be the same. <br />
<br />
How they handle the story isn&#039;t terrible, in fact its really great for enjoying and understanding so I do give it praise. The episodes are split into about 2 episode arcs. The first episode is generally the story without any information, and yes it can be a little strange. The second episode generally gives you the information you need to understand what happened the last episode and also wraps it up by either retelling it through a different lens or just continuing it from a different angle. There really is no overarching plot line. Each mini story gives a little of itself to the story as a whole but its pretty much a slice of life show about Sasami. <br />
<br />
The art wasn&#039;t great, nor was it terrible. I love Shaft art normally and was a bit disappointed how tame this show was. The art felt more like a homage to your typical Shaft show. True there were some head tilts, hair moving, odd character traits and many more, but it all felt subdued and not really a part of the show. The soundtrack was alright, didn&#039;t really stand out at all.<br />
<br />
The characters were boring imo. Sasami being the MC, is a shut in who ran away from home and her responsibilities. She was supposed to take over the power that the gods have given her. She instead turns her attention to living her life as a child. Her brother has been trained to take care of her every need, so he does everything for her like she is a baby. You also have the Yagami sisters which are gods themselves, and they are guardians of Sasami.<br />
<br />
The characters overall didn&#039;t leave much of an impact on me. Once and awhile a good speech or scene will arise where a character gets some growth but most of the show revolves around Sasami and her antics of being unsocial and shut in.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the show at first. I believed that it would be as others had acted like it was a typical crazy shaft experience. However it turned into a snore fest. This show is flat out boring, stuff happens occasional that could cause interest but it all falls flat. There is little to no comedy, story, character progression, fan service, or anything, its just plain mild. However that being said some may enjoy it. Don&#039;t be swayed by people calling it super wild and crazy, its really tame for shaft and easy to follow the action for the most part. So if your into people not living up to their potential, trying their best, friendship, learning to cope, solving issues..etc then you may want to give it a watch.<br />
<br />
TLDR: Not Shafty enough, pretty boring and mild. Read the second paragraph for a much better and non misleading synopsis than the standard MAL one.

    I almost dropped this on the first episode. Thought I was waching one kind of show and then it abruptly become something completly different without much explination. Thats no bad if you do it right, but this were not the case. The stupid characters (Only Sasami seems fine), the crazy random events and the incest jokes doesn&#039;t helped either. But I rarely judge by one episode, so I continued watching and soon found it somehow pretty enjoyable. The show manages to be always cleverly surprising and keeps improving on each episode. And even when there is not a propper plot underneath, there is a lot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review226602">
        of mistery and touchy moments and I was always looking fordward to know what happens next. Characters don&#039;t get much better though. They just don&#039;t have enought screen-time to develop themself, even when all of them have a rich back-story. Still, the show is pretty good overall. If you have no problem with no-linear story-telling, give it a chance and don&#039;t get fooled by the firsts episodes.<br />
<br />
On more thing, I think the show was tagged wrong: &#039;dementia&#039; its probably a more proper label. Also, don&#039;t expect any romance.

    Sasami is so much more complicated than I thought it would be to be honest. I think that for some, it might be too much to absorb at one time. But if you can follow the pace of this anime, it&#039;s actually really good. There&#039;s a complex plot that keeps on unfolding, with the addition of humor and some classic tsundere/incest moments for the people that enjoy those things. It&#039;s a blend of a lot of things, so every person can find at least one thing that they like or want to watch in the anime.

    I was fooled by the synopsis...<br />
Based on the synopsis I(and probably others as well) thought the anime would revolve around Sasami&#039;s(main character) struggles to fit in with society and her shut-in NEET life.<br />
For the first few the episodes the anime did deliver this and i was really enjoying it until the mythological/supernatural element started to kick in which I REALLY WASNT expecting in such a context.<br />
Usually the latter half of the episodes would be about supernatural/Japanese god stuff.<br />
From what i have seen of  Studio SHAFT , they really like to confuse their viewers by adding the most random stuff in their episodes or have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310647">
        a weirdly interesting sequence of frames that doesn&#039;t make much sense and isn&#039;t supposed to either and I thought the same thing was happening in this series as well which it was Until like some episodes later their was actually a story behind the whole thing.... <br />
I really wasn&#039;t taking any of it seriously until like half way through the anime.<br />
I&#039;m not really a fan of Japanese gods and all that stuff so it did really bore me and the second half was all about it.<br />
Even the story line didn&#039;t make much sense. I was very close to dropping this anime when the whole mother-daughter thing started to happen but somehow managed to watch the whole of it and the ending was pretty predictable.<br />
But i still really enjoyed the NEET part of the story as well as  the yuri between Sasami and Kagami.I guess that&#039;s why i gave it a  7 and not a 4 or a 5.<br />
I did like the art and animation since its Studio SHAFT and the main cast was pretty interesting as well.Just the supernatural storyline didn&#039;t fit in.<br />
Tbh I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;ll like this anime even if you are a fan of all the Japanese mythology and gods because the context of it was kinda stupid (which might be a spoiler).<br />
If i had the chance to rewatch it (which i probably wouldn&#039;t) i would only watch the first 3-4 episodes and the sasami x kagami episode

    This is my second time watching Sasami-san, I didn&#039;t remember ANYTHING about this anime, except one thing, the feeling that it was somewhat &quot;special&quot;, and in short that&#039;s the best way of describing it that i can find. <br />
<br />
This anime isn&#039;t good, isn&#039;t bad, and it ain&#039;t mediocre either, the story and characters are fun but lack any kind of real development. Everything it&#039;s as if I&#039;m supposed to know previews events or entities that are presented. It has this monogatari series feel to it (hell it&#039;s even has the same animation studio), but having only one season so clustered with information and things that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review351753">
        are never explained just makes this anime fall real deep into oblivion.<br />
<br />
In short, Sasami-san has lots of potential that was and will sadly never be explored, it&#039;ll stay as this &quot;special&quot; anime that couldn&#039;t be what it could
