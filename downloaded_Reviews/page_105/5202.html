Do you guys like competitive &quot;sports?&quot; Do you get excited about seeing people compete with different ideologies and aspirations? Well look no further, you may or may not find that in Nana Maru San Batsu (which I will now call FFF)! It depends on what kind of taste you have. I personally would compare it to Chihayafuru because the concept of being the fastest in both respective sports is reflexes and finger speed. FFF surprised me with how well executed the journey is and how interesting a quiz bowl could be. I personally wouldn&#039;t do this at all, but I can see it being

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258099">
        a really competitive thing and that&#039;s what matters. <br />
<br />
What FFF does right is constantly developing the main character Koushiyama. Since he is the main character we are following, it is important that he doesn&#039;t get overshadowed by other characters, who are admittedly plot devices with no real development on their own. It&#039;s challenging to fit engaging characters throughout the whole run time due to the 12 episode constraint as well as obligatory rule explanations. However, FFF does it to a pretty good degree, putting characters in the limelight here and there and really showing their personalities. Koushiyama is undoubtedly the most developed of the cast, albeit perhaps a little too one dimensional. He has tremendous upside in the quiz bowl because he is a nerd to begin with. So naturally, he is rather decent at Quiz Bowl, but watching him develop into an above average player felt satisfying because the competitors all had more intense motivations and clashing ideologies about the sport. It made for an engaging narrative since there are implications like: do what you love and screw what other people say, move forward, relentlessly etc. It was really impressive for something that doesn&#039;t have a synopsis that&#039;d pull much viewers.<br />
<br />
The animation is okay, it sometimes used it to its advantage and visually show us the inner working of people&#039;s minds with decent symbolism. Other then that, nothing really stood out to me and the OST is likewise forgettable. Heck, I can&#039;t remember any track playing. <br />
<br />
All in all, I came in with no expectations (as i usually do) and finished wanting more. It truly has potential and a longer run time would exponentially improve the development of characters. I really appreciate the passion displayed by these athletes, since I know the feeling of doing something nobody respected. Do what you love and you&#039;ll never work a day in your life folks.

    Quizzes and more quizzes. They could be fun if the watchers feel the same interest in both the questions and the participants. If you don&#039;t like quizzes shows, then you immediately will consider Nana Maru San Batsu (Fastest Finger First) as a total waste of time, and the only fastest finger that you will end seeing is yours when you &quot;change&quot; for other show.<br />
<br />
I had been thinking how to rate this anime. Should I evaluate the questions, should I rate the quizzes modules, should I rate the characters? After a lot of thinking, I considered there is nothing to measure here.<br />
<br />
The story is the typical

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258130">
        &quot;nerd&quot; with his glasses and every detail (Koshiyama). The destiny gave him the possibility to talk with a group of persons and ended joining the quizzes club from the school because Mari Fukami asked him. Then the story focuses on the game meetings against other schools, where Koshiyama finds a rival (Mikuriya). The climax appears when Koshiyama can&#039;t press the button faster, the inability to answer a certain group of questions, and when he challenges Mikuriya. So they spend a couple of minutes when Koshiyama starts analyzing the problems and figures a possible answer. That&#039;s all the story, nothing more. There are some unconcluded parts, for example, Mari&#039;s brother.<br />
<br />
The characters are the typical members of a school club with nothing special on them. They are in that club because they like it and will participate in the events because why not? The background of most of the characters they like quizzes, they study them, they need faster fingers, and ¡hey I found a rival!.<br />
<br />
The art and the music are what I consider standard nothing impressive here and nothing to complain about it.<br />
<br />
Finally, the characters do a little monologue when they try to figure an answer. It is the same repetition from question to question so you could end tired even if you like quizzes. Will I recommend this show to you? Maybe but you will consider it tedious.

    Nana Maru San Batsu or Fastest Finger First is an cliche anime similar to many school-based, guy joins a club&#039;esque type of anime. It&#039;s about quiz bowl which is basically a competitive Jeopardy, with the main focus of answering the questions quickly and correctly.<br />
<br />
Initially, I was expecting like an average 6 rated show, archetype characters, cliche story and so forth. Well, it turned out to be a lot worse.<br />
<br />
Story (3). Basically, a nerd joins junior high, during the club ceremonies he is picked to join the &quot;Quiz Bowl&quot; team for a display game. &quot;Now even though he is new to the game, he is extremely

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254251">
        talented and smart because of his lack of friends, he spent all his time in the library&quot;. Also playing with him is his love interest  which is passionate to the game, so you can guess who convinced him to join. The rest of the story can be guessed as any competitive club focused story. <br />
<br />
Art (7). The art is well done, I only put a 7 since Toei Animation has a thing where they will drop the quality overtime. But for the first 4 episodes, it&#039;s consistent so no problems there. <br />
<br />
Sound (5). The OST is barely heard throughout the episodes, which isn&#039;t bad but it could have improved the general tone and feeling. OP and ED are good enough, however I&#039;m not counting them towards the score. The voice acting is decent enough, so no major complaints, but there are moments when there is lack of passion. <br />
<br />
Characters (4). Every single character can be described in 2 sentences or less. They all can be put into a certain sub-group of a major archetype except the minor characters, in which case they don&#039;t have more than 1 emotion. Basically, its 1 or 2 levels above the average harem series, but still down there. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (1). One of my mains points for a non-action oriented show is dialogue, which is complete trash. Characters describing things in the least original way possible. &quot;cough&quot; Toei style &quot;cough&quot;. In later episodes, there is a ton repetition, same thing is said within 2 minutes of each other, then repeated every time something similar is mentioned. If Toei could fix that, then this show would have entered at least a 6 on my scale. <br />
<br />
Overall (3). <br />
Story: Cliche<br />
Art: Good<br />
Sound: Not noticeable<br />
Characters: Basic<br />
Enjoyment: Dialogue completely destroyed it for me.<br />
<br />

    Hit the buzzer first. The difference in facing victory or defeat may depend on a single second or even less. The adventures of a boy who has the talent, but now needs to apply that talent into competitive quizzing against other people.<br />
<br />
Fastest finger first was on my &quot;Meh&quot; watching list. I was kinda hesistant. But after watching 4 episodes, I probably will continue.<br />
<br />
One of the things many people talked about regarded the main Female Character and her voice actor. I&#039;ll be honest, I wasn&#039;t a big fan of it when I first heard it. Not because it was bad, but because it did not seem

          <span style="display: none;" id="review253780">
        to fit her character enough. However, after watching for a while, I started getting used to it, as I should be. She&#039;s smart and was responsible for getting Koshiyama into the world of competitive quizzing. But for him to succeed, he needs to learn the basics (which I can&#039;t even understand cuz im stupid). The anime shows that quizzing is more about being smart, but learning to deconstruct each question, breaking it down so that at the exact syllable, you will be able to immediately know the answer to the question. <br />
<br />
Thing is, Koshiyama is not very good at answering questions fast. He needs to hear the whole question in order to come up with some sort of answer. This is when all these lessons come in, and he&#039;s taught the art of buzzing. Hopefully we can get more insight into the basics and see Koshiyama develop into one of the fastest buzzerrs in the series.<br />
<br />
Theres not much to say after 4 episodes, but I wouldn&#039;t recommend this to people who want something &quot;amazing&quot; or awesome characters or a solid story. But, if you do have the time and you like something along the lines of competitive quizzing, then go ahead and enjoy yourself. It has a pretty nice atmosphere to it, and the character interactions aren&#039;t that bad.<br />
<br />
In the end, it&#039;s all about being fast, and being the first to buzz.<br />

    I personally love the concept of discovering something you love and truly being passionate about it. This show is exactly that.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Good story, I love seeing characters strive to become better. The idea pf animating something like quiz bowl is definitely unique. There are certain stories are not concluded which I find annoying. 7/10<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
KOSHIYAMA: An intersting character, like i said I love seeing pasionate characters so I really liked him<br />
FUKAMI: Honestly I didn&#039;t care much for her. She was really only there for the main female character appeal and her brother&#039;s backstory<br />
SASAJIMA: Calm cool and collected, there could be more back story to him<br />
MIKURIYA: His rivalry

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258445">
        with Koshiyama was interesting but he&#039;s literally just another kid who likes quiz bowl,there could be some expansion on his character<br />
6/10<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
I liked the character design and everyone is distinguishable. There are a few parts where the art is not so amazing but I can overlook that. 7/10<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Loveee the OP and ED! So catchy! Voice acting was good except for Fukami. Her voice actor isn&#039;t necessarily bad but her voice  doesn&#039;t give a young high school student vibe like it should. 7/10<br />
<br />
Other stuff:<br />
The subtitles kind of ruin the curiosity of wondering when they will press their button. It would be interesting to see this dubbed. <br />

    It&#039;s not often you&#039;ll see an anime based around a quiz game. This is what initially brought me to try Nana Maru San Batsu. To quickly summarize some of my thoughts on the anime, I though the art and animation were average at best, and apart from the amazing opening song, the same thing can be said about the soundtrack.A lot of the characters were either annoying or uninteresting. The way the story is presented, it feels more like a shounen rather than the seinen it actual is. The major positive I can say for the series is that when it got to doing the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258097">
        quiz scenes the anime became incredibly interesting to watch. Often it feels like I&#039;m playing alongside the characters in the show, trying to guess the answer before they do. As a result of this, I got a lot of enjoyment from Nana Maru San Batsu despite how average everything else in the show was.<br />
While there could have been better execution, I was satisfied with my experience with this show.

    Fastest finger first is over.<br />
Finally, it was pretty bad.<br />
The concept at the beginning was cool.<br />
I don&#039;t know much about quiz bowl or even heard of the subject of it.<br />
Which is the premise of the show by the way.<br />
And I was semi excited to learn more about it through this anime.<br />
And from the anime&#039;s view on quiz bowl presented to me.<br />
It wasn&#039;t very exiting.<br />
It was about these trivia super geniuses that can answer a question without hearing the entire answer through various techniques.<br />
And apparently that is realistic to the actual thing.<br />
I think that&#039;s what ruined it for me.<br />
I couldn&#039;t project anyone onto any of the characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258585">
        in the series.<br />
Also, the characters are very stereotypical and bland.<br />
Even the voice actors got bored or at least weren&#039;t casted well.<br />
So Fastest Finger First, I give it a 3 being generous.<br />
Just not a very appealing anime to watch.<br />
I wouldn&#039;t recommend to anyone.<br />
This has been ur spoiler not spoiler review on Fastest Finger First

    Press the buzzer before anyone else does!<br />
<br />
The anime has some sort of flow and predictability of what the format of the next episodes are going to be like. The anime is about Koshiyama, a first-year student who was invited and convinced by Fukami and Sasajima to join the Quiz Study Group where they participate in regular quiz competitions against other schools. The aim of the game is to press the buzzer before anyone else and answer within five seconds. You can press the buzzer at any time, even before the announcer has completed reading out the question.<br />
<br />
Now this anime isn&#039;t for everyone. From a title

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254489">
        like Fastest Finger First and this short synopsis, you are getting exactly was you expected. There&#039;s nothing special about this anime. It&#039;s exactly as how the anime is described, there are no real surprises. This means that if this sounds like an anime that you won&#039;t like, then you probably won&#039;t like it and I wouldn&#039;t recommend you go out of your way to watch it.<br />
<br />
The slow introduction of new characters and their unique sets of attributes which are useful to be part of the quiz team is what makes this anime special. Each of the characters have the strengths and weaknesses, but when they combine their strenghts, they become a strong team that are able to help each other depending on what type of question is being asked.<br />
<br />
The subtle hints of romance between Koshiyama and Fukami is what brings to light to this rather simple concept applied to this anime. It&#039;s done not too over dramatically which is pleasing to see.<br />
<br />
The voice acting is quite refreshing for the characters, especially for Fukami, who is the lead female protagonist. There is some criticism for Kawashima Umika, who voices Fukami because she is not very experienced in voice acting anime characters, but I find her natural voice to be fitting in this anime as voice actors sometimes over-do it and over-dramatise scenes where they are almost unberable to watch to the point where they are cringe worthy. <br />
<br />
The OP and ED is quite catchy which fits the mood of this quick fast paced game anime. <br />
<br />
The animation of this anime is passable. There&#039;s nothing wrong with it and I some of the character designs are unique. There are some characters who do look the same as other anime characters from other anime but overall, the character designs aren&#039;t bad. <br />
<br />
Overall, I am thoroughly enjoying this anime. I do see reasons why people will not like this anime but for the select few who like a change in pace in anime and see something out of the ordinary, this anime is perfect for that. This isn&#039;t necessarily a good anime, but it definitely isn&#039;t a bad one. I recommend that you check it out.<br />

    Quiz Bowl for anime/manga/games aficionados out there...MONDAI?!<br />
<br />
Which female seiyuu who played the most alien character?<br />
<br />
Mondai?!<br />
<br />
Name the seiyuus who recently passed away this year.<br />
<br />
Mondai?!<br />
<br />
Name a movie that was based on an on-line game. <br />
<br />
Ok so enough of the overrated Jeopardy game, so now that this is over I really have mixed feelings about this anime, and there were no simple ways for me to describe it, so:<br />
<br />
Story, fair 6.<br />
<br />
Ok so for a change studio TMS has decide to go with an anime that has some sort of quiz bee theme in it, ok it wasn&#039;t that bad, but it ain&#039;t that good either, since we all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258306">
        know in a Jeopardy kinda of game show it all about luck and the knowledge you have, and no matter how you do your best it all boils down to luck.<br />
<br />
Art; Mediocre 5.<br />
<br />
As usual, to them Japs everything looks good as long as the cast were young and in a school uniform, there is only a one time panty shot and it ain&#039;t with Fukami Mari and with Kansai girl Sasajima Jinko, rather it was some unknown girl extra who is also in Buzou High.<br />
<br />
Sound, Poor 3. <br />
<br />
I may not have any opinion for the opening and closing theme, but I do have a fuss about Fukami&#039;s voice, it seems that for studio TMS to choose a mature montone seiyu in Kawashima Umika, who simply doesn&#039;t have that young tone, they should have gone with Tomtsu Haruka or Itou Kanade to do Fukai&#039;s voice, now for Koshiyama&#039;s voice, his seiyu, Horie Shun  sounded a bit too gay in would have been better if Sonohara Akira&#039;s seiyu, Nagatsuka Takuma would have played his character instead of voicing that cross dressing fag character. <br />
<br />
Character, fair 6.<br />
<br />
Ok so it was suppose to be them Buzou High students that should be the main protagonist here , but in reality it kinda looks that the suppose protagonist would go back and fort of being a protagonist to a deuteragonist to a tritagonist , here the main character Kosiyama starts out as a protagonist and in the end he was reduce to a deuteragonist the same thing with Mari, she would bounce back and fort from being a deuteragonist to a protagonist sometime Sasajima Gakuto would be a tertiary to a protagonist, but if there is one character there that ticking me off is Sonohara Akira, he is one character that I wish that the club president would have punched him in his face.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment, Good 7.<br />
<br />
I was good when this is one anime where you get to learn a lot of trivia.<br />
<br />
Overall, fair 6.<br />
<br />
You get to know a lotta trivia, but on the entertainment side it was a bit lackluster, a season 2 may break or make this , but it will all depend how good will studio TMS do it.<br />
<br />
Mondai?!<br />
<br />
Which seiyuu who had a cameo role in a live Japanese move &quot;Fujoshi Kanojo?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Mondai?!<br />
<br />
Which Deadnote seiyuu who played the role of Katsumi Kamio in the movie &quot;Otoko-tachi no Yamato?&quot;  <br />
<br />
   <br />

    I was not expecting Nana Maru San Batsu to be good. Going into it, I though I was probably going to end up dropping it and giving it a 5 or possibly a 6. Though as I watched each episode, I just kept wanting to watch more until I&#039;d finished all 12 episodes and thoroughly enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
You might notice a marked difference in reviews on this site between those who watched 4 episodes and declared it to be cliched, and those who actually bothered to watch the whole show before giving it a full review. Not just in term of score, which we&#039;d expect to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275751">
        be lower on average among people who dropped it, but even among the comments left by people who gave it low scores, but bothered to actually finish it vs people who didn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
The story is very good. In contrast to what some people on this site seem to think, because they only watched a few episodes, this is not the story of some noob high school boy rising to become a star because he&#039;s just so wonderful. This is actually the story of a shy, nerdy kid making friends and finding something he&#039;s passionate about that he can actually share with other people, in contrast to most of his life that he&#039;s spent withdrawing. Whilst he obviously improves at quiz bowl through the series, at the actual game I would say he never even surpasses Mari Fukami, the girl who recruited him in and has some experience. He&#039;s more overall knowledgable than her, but his style and ability to play the game still need polish even by the end. The quizzing serves as an interesting central theme and provides some really surprisingly tense moments (the stakes are never too high that the MC and his friends can&#039;t fail) but the MC&#039;s journey through it is really not the main thrust of the story, the story is fundamentally about his development as a person with the sport of quiz bowl.The primary downside of the story is that there are some loose threads that don&#039;t really get resolved, and the fact that by the end of it, he&#039;s really just beginning and it might be nice to see more, but I can&#039;t blame the anime just because it doesn&#039;t get renewed. And the reason for the couple of loose threads is obvious, the point of this anime is most likely for promotion of the manga. That being said I think the show ends at a very natural conclusion to a first arc and they don&#039;t try and cram too much in, or try to stretch out too little too far. The pacing is just right and these &quot;downsides&quot; are really very minor points as far as I am concerned, it&#039;s not like we&#039;re missing big pieces of information, just little intrigues.<br />
<br />
The art is very decent. This show clearly didn&#039;t have a grandiose budget and the art isn&#039;t always 100% on point, but it looks perfectly nice, there really isn&#039;t anything that egregious and there are moments where I think the art really shines.<br />
<br />
The music is probably the weakest part. I&#039;ll be kind and say the music is... generic, though I&#039;d go as far as to say that some BGM tracks sound almost ripped off. I don&#039;t know if it was supposed to be in homage or if they just didn&#039;t have the budget but a number of tracks sounded suspiciously familiar, especially in their beginnings. That being said, none of the music sounds bad so ultimately I can&#039;t give this a negative score, the music does the job it&#039;s supposed to do but nothing overall stands out. A lot of people have a go at Fukami&#039;s VA. I completely disagree. Whilst I will agree that her inexperience shows and you won&#039;t get as emotive a performance as you might expect from anime (the VA apparently is more experienced in live action dramas), this actually fits the character extremely well. Fukami is a pretty soft-spoken quiz nerd and the toned down performance absolutely works for her. And her voice sounds really nice, it&#039;s refreshing to have a high school girl in anime that actually sounds like she&#039;s experienced puberty at some point. There are only one or two points where I think the VA could have put a little bit more into emoting but overall she sounds absolutely fine. Maybe not as you might EXPECT, but certainly fitting for the character.<br />
<br />
The characters are my favourite part. They&#039;re all VERY likeable people. It&#039;s extremely rare that I actually like the characters in mixed-gender main cast animes. Usually they end up acting like fucking tools and nobody responds appropriately and I end up just hating everyone in it which is why most of my top anime are all-girl main casts, I feel they&#039;re just written with better dynamics and make way more sense. In this case, everyone is very down to earth and they act normally. Well, with the exception of moments where characters have deliberately exaggerated moments of teenage-boyness. But I could easily imagine knowing these people in a school club in real life. They act like actual human beings.<br />
<br />
Again people with only 4 episodes watched seem to be under the impression that these are all generic archetype charachters and they know everything they will do. Well most of them are wrong in their specific appraisals. As I said previously, the main boy never becomes some god and doesn&#039;t even surpass the main girl in skill. He starts off around the level of the otaku who joined because of the cute girl and ends up closer to the skill level of the cute girl. The reason he is main character is because of his POTENTIAL, which people can see because he has a wealth of knowledge from extensive book reading. If he could refine his game some more, which I&#039;m sure he&#039;d do if the series was longer, THEN he could be a really great player. Similarly there are predictions of &quot;love interest&quot; - Well, there are very minor implications that Fukami might like him but throughout the series they are just friends, with a similar level of relationship as anyone else to anyone else in the club. I&#039;d also like to say that in the first episode the Main Boy sees the Main Girl&#039;s panties, because anime (although they never actually show the panty shot which is great because fuck that). Does she hold this as a grudge against him for the rest of the series? No. It causes a couple of moments of embarrassment (in a couple of jokes where he has to push thoughts of them aside) and by the end of the first episode she says &quot;whatever I&#039;m over it now come join quiz bowl with me&quot;. You know, like normal people (though fairly uncommon for anime characters).<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m not saying these characters will blow your mind with their pure originality and never-before seen character traits, I&#039;m just saying, there&#039;s a lot more to them as people than [insert cliche label here], in my opinion. They&#039;re incredibly likeable and I can really get invested into their journey and their interactions with the other characters around them. Which is what a good character needs to be. This isn&#039;t even mentioning that 4 episodes isn&#039;t enough to even meet all the characters, including the spanner in the works.<br />
<br />
Overall, I really liked this show and I rate it at a solid 8. It&#039;s definitely something that is worth giving a go, unless you just really hate quizzes. I will repeat, this show probably won&#039;t blow your mind and be the best thing you&#039;ve ever seen, but it&#039;s a very enjoyable and solidly put together show show that deserves a hell of a lot more love than a damn 6.8 MAL score. It knows where to best utilise the limited budget to minimise the downsides and a clearly competent staff have managed to produce an unexpectedly good product about an unusual premise, a hidden gem of 2017.

    There are plenty of anime under the sun. That would mean some of them would be overlooked and that is just the cold, hard truth. However, as time rolls by, the overlooked shall become the cult. For instance, Nana Maru San Batsu.<br />
<br />
The overall premise is (even I have to admit) the nerdiest to be seen yet (even nerdier than Real Girl so heads up, everyone). Here we have our typical high-school bookworm, Koshiyama Shiki, who one day discovered the joy of... wait for it... quiz! Splash it with Anime 101 art and Beyblade-ish animation, I personally wouldn&#039;t blame anyone to not even consider touching the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314000">
        first episode. However, anime such as this is what truly inspired me to be an anime critic in first place: to shed light for the overlooked, to inspire people to re-consider.<br />
<br />
The most impressive thing about Nana Maru San Batsu is how it presents quiz as more than entertainment anyone would see on TV. There is art behind all kinds of quiz and somehow, quiz manages to capture popular culture and historical landmarks better than the most viral social media post. Moreover, all the characters come off as unapologetic in their passion (and sometimes, obsession) for quiz. For each and every one of these outliers, it is never about buzzing the light-bulb and winning the human-size check. They become strong, wise, and self-sufficient because they are trained to embrace adrenaline, changes, and swift responses. After all, isn&#039;t that what life is all about?<br />
<br />
Nana Maru San Batsu may not be for everyone. More often than not, otaku love anime because of their loyalty, not their taste-making ability. However, should one wish to seek a palate cleanser, this is definitely for you. A cult following wouldn&#039;t hurt anyone and in fact, you could feel like one of the elites-- the selected few who had enjoyed the exclusive pleasure that was Nana Maru San Batsu.<br />

    Starter for 10 was a film i think i saw a few years back but memories fade and by the rate mine are fading I will be in an assisted care home by 2021. But that film is about quizzes, more importantly the true king of the &quot;Sort of after The One Show&quot; slot for the BBC, University Challenge. I&#039;ve always complained how I don&#039;t think its fair that most team members are mature students who really take the title to its extremes. They roam these isles, bouncing from Anthropology of Dragon Dicks post graduate courses to Four Dimensional Town Planning at the University of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254928">
        South Wales, with cackled laughter piercing from their bet sit. They are the true journeymen and women of a televised Oxbridge college circle jerk where you get a dressing down by an aged broadcast journalist.<br />
<br />
Fastest Finger First takes this and puts it in a Japanese high school and tries to use a medium which relies on motion picture to rely the importance of pressing a button quite quickly. They answer questions, some of which are easy because you are born in the decadent west, and some you&#039;ll never get yourself, and then very few which are to pander to fan service and they have a boy to play the role of you.<br />
<br />
We follow a squirrel looking kid with coke bottle glasses and a slight cows lick and he is nervous but reads things so he is better at quizzes than the general population, but he has a long way to go so there is room for progress and 60 manga chapters. He doesn&#039;t buzz in quick enough, and he has not rote learned the questions yet, because he has been doing this, as of episode 5, for about 4 and a half days. He has made a pretty boy rival, a few friends, and a slightly better understanding of quizzing. I&#039;m sure he will win University Challenge by the end of the season, then stab Jeremy Paxman in the kidneys.<br />
<br />
A lot has been said about the voice actor for the girl in your merry band of quiz-o-nauts, and from my limited knowledge of Japan, the actor sounds like a normal Japanese women speaking normally in a non-descript accent. You get used to it, because people naturally pick up emotional undertones in someone&#039;s voice after a while, even though there are very few coming through. It&#039;s just daunting because you come to expect that she will sound like a what a cat would sound like if had a firm ass and was serving you coffee.<br />
<br />
To finalise, this show isn&#039;t a good show, but it has something that only quiz shows have: you can play along. You can sit there and see if you can get the question and answer from the three and a half syllables they use because the Japanese are the true super intelligent beings of east Asia and Kia can&#039;t make cars for shit. And when you do its fun, you feel a sense of pride that you can never get from watching cartoons your soul spirit is getting bullied in a real Japanese high school right now. The blonde hair dyed street thugs are continuing the tradition of sticking a lit firecracker up his rectum and making him do the Macarena and putting the footage on Weibo or whatever they use to publicly humiliate each other over there.<br />
<br />
You can&#039;t play a long to Kill La Kill while watching, so this is objectively better. Like 12/19

    I like it. It&#039;s still ongoing right now so the reviews are not that firm. I think it will develop into a greater storyline. There are still many more characters to be introduced. The characters are very likable. Although it&#039;s about &#039;quizzes&#039; it isn&#039;t boring. It&#039;s more about the energy of the competition and the various play styles and the cooperation of the members of the quiz clubs.<br />
The main character is a literacy lover, but he will develop furthermore. Plus the art style is good. The show also has a comedy vibe going on. And the music sure gets you excited.<br />
<br />
I recommend to anyone who

    LA has a strong affinity when it comes to liking &quot;weird tournament sports anime&quot;, from mahjong to jousting to flying tag to freakin&#039; boob and butt wrestling.......time to add quiz bowl to the list.<br />
<br />
Nana Maru San Batsu falls under the typical underdog character who goes into a field where he knows ALOT of and finds his interest in trying to be the best by learning the ropes...such is the case of Shiki Koshiyama in competitive quizzing. <br />
<br />
Nana Maru San Batsu somehow made competitive quizzing to be addrenalined pumping, something as mudane as quizzing and to be honest in the early episodes of Nana Maru San

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258111">
        Batsu, LA just saw Nana Maru San Batsu go through the ropes of telling us tips in competitive quizzing and general introduction to the world of quizzing. LA being a person who likes to find the most useless of information &quot;just because&quot; however this anime easily intrigued LA as well as getting LA to join in in the quizzes along with the characters and thus LA could easily relate to Shiki Koshiyama in this way. Other members of Shiki&#039;s Quiz Group consisting of Daisuke Inoue (wait the mangaka??!!..no) voiced by Tasuku Hatanaka the pop culture and maths expert of their group, Mari Fukami voiced by Umika Kawashima who have the ability to buzz in quickly and have knowledge of etymology who gets some family character development who ties into the next character Gakuto Sasajima voiced by Takuya Satou, the Captain of the Buzou High School Research Group and Quiz Club and essentially the Ace of the group. Shiki also comes across rivals when delving into the world of quizzing, consisting of Chisato Mikuriya voiced by Kaito Ishikawa who is essentially the tough by fair rival to Shiki but is also Shiki&#039;s best mentor in striving for him to do better at quizzing and Akira Sonohara voiced by Takuma Nagatsuka a more sneaky, snarky loophole abusing quizzer who likes to cause more chaos than answering the questions in a civil manner, quite the opposite to Chisato if anything. LA&#039;s favourite character however goes to Chiaki Sonohara voiced by Ayane Sakura, Captain of the Asagaoka All-Girls Quiz Team as LA just loves Ayane Sakura&#039;s reactions and her REGAL accenting.<br />
<br />
So why does LA sees Nana Maru San Batsu addrenaline-filled?...well answering the questions as well as seeing Shiki succeed is actually thrilling in some cases and many of the matches or training quizzes and getting the audience into it all gets LA into the competitive atmosphere, kinda like how Akira wants...in making the quizzes interesting. Compounding this would be the tips and tricks Nana Maru San Batsu teaches us kinda helps in making this a rather participatory audience anime and it succeeds.......if only the questions weren&#039;t so HARD (This was for LA, though LA got some right out of luck, obviously this statement varies for others) as LA has knowledge like Tasuku than Shiki goes through. Shiki is still your audience proxy throughout this anime and although he&#039;s a plain average bookworm character, LA still rooted for nonetheless.<br />
<br />
The animation for TMS Entertainment is consistent for the most part with the character designs being....plain to say the least as the majority of characters are in their respective school uniforms under their quiz meets, doesn&#039;t really allow for much change in wardrobe, with some exceptions in certain episodes. During the quizzes however many of the characters inner-monologing bring some nice coloring and visual flair reflecting how the characters are thinking and is probably the more interesting parts of the animation. Consistent as it is...TMS Entertainment did average in terms of animation even when they try to be exotic during the quiz inner-monologing.......it&#039;s kinda what you expect from a competitive quizzing anime.<br />
<br />
Now, voice acting, for the majority of the voice cast LA had no annoyances through this anime with Ayane Sakura easily taking LA&#039;s favourite voice actor for this anime, but that isn&#039;t what you want LA to talk about isn&#039;t it?...Umika Kawashima as Mari Fukami, she at the early episodes of this anime had what LA heard, stilted blunt voice acting which might have irked some people as it didn&#039;t fit into her character design and personality, LA being one of them, however later on LA came to accept her vocals and saw a differing side of Umika&#039;s vocals in a positive light, Umika really did became Mari especially when it came to her doing the quizzing...Umika was different and as long as she wasn&#039;t annoying she was ok at best and Umika was definitely NOT annoying in voicing Mari.<br />
<br />
Nana Maru San Batsu is another entry for LA into the weird tournament style sports anime, looking at quizzing let along competitive quizzing and although Nana Maru San Batsu can be preachy with it&#039;s tips and tricks for quizzing but it actively encouraging it&#039;s audience to participate in it&#039;s quizzes, give character development to it&#039;s underdog team and really making competitive quizzing fun, interesting, exhilarating and entertaining to watch.

    This show follow in the same line as many sports type anime, where MC comes to fall in love with a sport/hobby just from experiencing it first hand. <br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong, im not trying knock the show down a few pegs cause of this cliche.<br />
Stories about being passionate about what you love is all great.<br />
<br />
I think what this show suffer from in my opinion is this feeling of slowness even during the actual quizzing (show depicting real time instead of super slow or fast). Story in the anime doesn&#039;t go into a grande tournament only just few matches here and there and competition between

        school in a form of a &quot;meet-up&quot;.<br />

I only would recommend this anime to those who want to kill some time, interested in quiz bowl or game show style question in anime form.<br />

    *Review may contain minor spoilers*<br />
<br />
Quizzing.<br />
<br />
Story 7/10<br />
This anime follows more the sport genre story line, some &#039;loser&#039; with no friends or real talent, joins the quiz team to fall in love with it and give it its all. However I love sport anime so I do like this kind of story telling.<br />
<br />
art 7/10<br />
The art isn&#039;t anything special, just your normal art style anime, stayed consistent throughout the whole anime, I liked the intro to, and the buzzer system/ how they sometimes draw what was going on.<br />
<br />
Sound 6/10<br />
Opening song was good, voice acting was good except for the girl MC she has a unique voice some people

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258919">
        like it some people dont, I am one of those people who did&#039;t like her voice at all and really disturbed me in this anime.<br />
<br />
Character 7/10<br />
Your typical sport anime characters, got a loser, got some one who brings the loser in the club. got a upperclassman who is way to good and some one who joins because he likes the girl, nice development though.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9/10<br />
As a fan of sport anime, and this following kinda the same path, I like quizzing and thinking also, the only reason i can&#039;t give it a 10 is because of the girl MC&#039;s voice actor sorry.<br />
<br />
Overall 7/10<br />
Give this one a try, it is pretty good, and can be viewed in 2 different ways, you can view it very relaxing, or u can participate in what they are doing and get really hyped up about it.

    I agree with the rest of the reviewers of this show that the show can be a bit lackluster in some episodes when compared to highly-rated sports anime. However, this show still has the potential to set itself apart from the rest, due to the underlying concept of the show: how do you deal with information? The world is full of information and as humans there is a limit to what we can take in and what we leave out. I like how this show tantalizingly explores how an individual&#039;s interests can influence how he or she treats the information. If the show had more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review291613">
        episodes, I bet the story would be more engaging to audiences who aren&#039;t interested in quiz bowls. Specifically I would like to see more quiet moments of the characters when they are by themselves and what do they feel when they aren&#039;t among their friends or competitors. What frustrations do they face and what are their side hobbies? What, other than interest, separates them from people who aren&#039;t participating in quiz bowl? What separates the participants from each and what do they share? I want to see the subtle ways their preparedness for the quiz bowls aids in their day to day activities that lie outside participating in the quiz bowl. If this can be accomplished the story can literally go in any direction. The show can still retain its niche as a show about quiz bowls but can even go further with being a show that revolves around the intimate theme of how different people chose to deal with information in different ways depending on what it is to them. Although the show&#039;s story, art, sound and characters didn&#039;t make a lasting impression on me, I still kept watching to appreciate how close it was to be an intriguing show.

    All the cliches you hate, wrapped in subculture you probably know nothing about, that will do little to make you care further about that subculture.<br />
<br />
Story (3/10): Shy Main Character gets wrapped up in the &quot;Quiz Bowl&quot; club. His backstory is that his mom was a librarian and he&#039;s spent a lot of time in libraries so he&#039;s awkward af. He then proceeds to like quiz bowl club and the friends he makes in quiz bowl club. He&#039;s also the potential to become Jesus-kun at quiz bowl, so it&#039;s got that going for it I guess. That&#039;s it. Nothing more than the boiler plate stew of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254549">
        mediocrity.<br />
<br />
Art (4/10): Nothing special to see here. Nothing horrible either. It&#039;s not atrocious. It&#039;s functional. TBH now that I think about it, there&#039;s nothing about this show that necessitates the use of animation. I mean, you use animation when you need things to be surreal, or cute, or to exaggerate, or to do this visually unique or impossible to do otherwise. This show is about kids in high school hitting buzzers and answering questions. It&#039;s animated accordingly. <br />
<br />
Sound (5/10): The opening and credits music are the best thing about this show, but they&#039;re nothing special. And the buzzer sounds... I like buzzer sounds I guess. After that, there&#039;s no great music, no environment sounds, the cast is functional. There&#039;s nothing bad here... nothing good either. The voice of romantic interest girl though sounds weird though. Not good or bad, but just very non-traditional, which isn&#039;t by itself a bad thing... it&#039;s just noticeable and every time she speaks, I notice that her voice is weird.<br />
<br />
Character (2): Shy Main Character trope meets Romantic Interest Girl in the library on the first day of high school. Romantic Interest Girl falls over Shy Main Character and Shy Main Character sees her panties and develops a crush. This is the launch pad for the &quot;Will they, won&#039;t they&quot; dramatic and emotional friction that&#039;s supposed to carry us throughout the season.  Romantic Interest Girl figures out Shy&#039;s smart so she tricks him (sort of) into joining the club cuz she&#039;s really obsessed with it, and it turns out he likes the club. So we got our leads. Throw in the loud dumb best friend trope, the Super-Senpai trope, a Loli+Bratty sister, and we got our cast. That&#039;s as deep as this puddle gets. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (3): If there&#039;s any enjoyment to be had here, it&#039;d be from the actual quizzes. The competitions. The point of quiz bowl is the hear a question, buzz in as fast as possible, then get the right answer. So the real objective is to figure out the least amount of information you need from a question to guess what the question is going to ask, then answer the question. Interesting stuff! Except for the fun of this sport doesn&#039;t translate well when... translated. 90% of the reason people watch trivia shows like Jeopardy or game shows like Wheel of Fortune is so that you can play along. But with this, you can&#039;t play along, because you have to read the subtitles instead of listening alongside, and between Japanese sentence structures being different, and the fact that the sentences are being stopped midway through for the characters to answer, you don&#039;t get to appreciate the game at all. ... So I guess what you&#039;re left with is watching people react to people getting questions right or wrong... and if you can&#039;t enjoy the main premise of the quizzes the way you want to, then you gotta hang your hat on the characters, and like I said before, they&#039;re shallow at best. <br />
<br />
Also, just as a sidenote, this show does a deep disservice to it&#039;s female characters by over-sexualizing them. Anime, in general, has this problem overall, but this series really bugged with how they did it. It&#039;s no Eromanga-sensei at all, but that&#039;s at least a genre and it&#039;s done for a specific effect. This show is just plain disrespectful with how lazy and so ready they are to just lump the girls into girlfriend roles or idols to drool over. Our introduction to the main female protagonist has her exposing her panties. The next episode has her explicitly show off her thighs in her skirt. The one time we a group of girls talking without men around, they&#039;re gaggled around talking about how cute boys are. The loli brat sister type just came into the plot and she&#039;s introduced as the potential girlfriend for Super-Senpai. It&#039;s annoying and it&#039;s lazy and it&#039;s predictable. I have no moral objections. I drool over women. Just, make it interesting if you&#039;re going there at all.<br />
<br />
Overall (3/10): If you&#039;re an English speaking, subtitle reading anime fan like me, there&#039;s no enjoyment to watching the quizzes, which is the main draw for this show. There&#039;s no enjoyment to the characters, the art and production values do nothing the enhance or elevated the experience, and there&#039;s really no point for this show to exist in this form of media. Stay away from this pointless show.

    703X has an artillery of things most audience hate and disgust. <br />
A cute girl voiced as if her soul was suctioned with one third of it left and can&#039;t make high pitch cute voices to make you happy. (X) Bmmmkkk!!!<br />
A wimpy nerd who is just... a wimpy nerd he is. (X) Bmmmkkk!!!<br />
Ta-da! You have our 2 very main characters! And it&#039;s 2 Batsu now, could it get any better? Or will we drop this series?!<br />
<br />
CLICHE EVERYTHING! (X) !!! (X) !! (X) !!! (X) !!  (X) ! (X) !!! (X)  !!(X)  !!! (X) !!! (X) !!!!!!!!!! <br />
Shit show! Drop it! Burn it with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256139">
        the trash!<br />
<br />
Wait... this review gives an 8, there&#039;s has to be a punchline here. Well, burn in fire you normies!<br />
Cliche? Has any of your average moe girls sound so lady-like and actually sound similar to our Fukami? Has any of your seemingly wimpy MCs actually stay the way he is and not burst into a beast owning the world after more than half of the season?<br />
Sports-like anime journey is too cliche for you? Well, what the heck do you expect? Should we start from the top as a pro and degrade into a noob?<br />
<br />
This show does everything right and even better than lots of cliche sports animes that got rated 7 or higher in MAL. So why is it rated 6.9 now? Tngg-dngg!!! I know the answer! Because of normies! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Story (7/10): Plot moves steadily, firstly introducing our main character in the most cliche way possible! YES! The school opening has a club recruitment event and the quiz club started a game, our MC coincidentally or not, got summoned by the club chairman randomly. <br />
And because of his overwhelming talent, he proceeds to rekt the game! (X)<br />
And because there&#039;s a girl who is a quiz maniac in the game, he couldn&#039;t excel in the game. (O)<br />
And the rest is what it is, he joined the club and the club aims to conquer the world!<br />
Everything IS cliche!<br />
Our MC having a special talent in the game, a talented rival, a gril accompanying him, a motivation/passion for the game etc etc<br />
And that&#039;s all to it.<br />
It is a cliche storyline. But how else would we prefer it? You write Limericks with its rhythm or whatever-they-call-it fixed, same thing for this anime.<br />
Then it comes to the important part... How do you keep this quiz thing interesting?<br />
The show does it! They launched bunch of weird formats for the game and actually make the most out of them, always exhibiting the interesting and fun mechanics within.<br />
They don&#039;t rely on spectators from the side narrating how epic our MCs are and how they are improving, neither do they rely on hot OSTs raising the tension. They sucked at those parts! However, there is a lot of effort in the mind games part which is a direct content for viewers to consume. This show doesn&#039;t intend to fool you with those shounen sports trope, it is nerdy as it can get. And that is what separates 7O3X from your cliche sports animes.<br />
<br />
Characters (7/10): Our main characters are slowly developing from one dimensional so it&#039;s not as cliche as you presume.<br />
I&#039;m surprised Daisuke is actually a main character. This guy was tagged with side flags all over the moment he appeared. Yet he eventually become the most multifaceted character in the show so far, outshining our main... oh wait he is one of the main.<br />
To be honest, I like all the characters, but none are seriously my favorite, that&#039;s just enough for me.<br />
<br />
Sound (8/10): Like I said in Story department, they don&#039;t rely on OST to pull your feels. They really suck at that. But so far, they manage to suit every atmosphere.<br />
The OP and ED are nice though.<br />
<br />
Art(6.66/10): Nothing. If you want kirakira animation, this show can&#039;t give you anything. It&#039;s just your average art.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (8.5/10): The show is fun regardless of how directionless the plot gets, since it is a quiz show. It stands firm as the quiz animation it is.<br />
Overall: I&#039;m giving this show an 8 which is 1 point higher than my actual mark because I believe that it does not deserve to be in the 6 rate class. It should probably be at 7 flat. <br />
This show has potential all over. It is not good, but it is good enough.

    I don&#039;t know but practically, it looks like I&#039;m diverting from popular opinion once more (like how my entire life has been)<br />
<br />
Basically, &quot;I liked this show&quot; is an understatement. I am so hooked with this show I pretty much have to wait in the wee hours of Wednesdays (SE Asian Time fyi) just to get to the latest episode.<br />
<br />
Let me start with the thing I least liked: Art (6). It was fairly decent, can tell that the budget was pretty low. Nonetheless it didn&#039;t fail to at least animate what&#039;s basic.<br />
<br />
Character (7). I know that such characters were already a stereotype: faint-hearted main character, a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257650">
        supportive co-lead, the club president seeing more raw talent, a rival, a playful and dreadsome character, etc. Nonetheless, it was good enough. They were able to complement each other in a sense that it gave some congruence to the story.<br />
<br />
Sound (8). I know the issues with seiyuu (voice actors) and stuff. It boils to a common denominator as anything else at first glance: budget. However, they were able to fetch some popular seiyuus into the scene, so it might not be the case. They did their job well, I would say. (Nope, I left out my seyuu ships/bias in this rating).<br />
<br />
Story (9). Being someone who wished he lived his youth in Japan, I found myself yearning for the experience depicted in this anime. I am a big fan of general knowledge quizzes or questions. The story seems to follow yet another stereotypical turn, but nah, that&#039;s the fault in the manga. Anime is merely an adaptation. I find myself hooked with how such a newbie adjusts and adapts, bringing out what he can.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10). Like what I said in the Story, I liked this anime because I am personally into general knowledge. Each episode is a bunch of suspense and fun, and each week gives me such unbearable impatience. I find myself pressing on the pause button to guess along, trying to test my knowledge.<br />
<br />
Overall (9). The anime is titled &quot;Nanamaru Sanbatsu&quot; and the translation &quot;Fastest Finger First&quot; diverted the focus somewhere else (from the goal: &quot;7 correct, 3 incorrect&quot; to the basic skill each player needed) and that is crap. But that doesn&#039;t belong to this score of (9). This score is because I diminish from my attention what is not that important for me, and I focused on what made me enjoy-- what makes me watch this anime in the first place. A lot of popular titles can&#039;t even make me sustain my focus and end up feel bland, but this one stole my attention.
