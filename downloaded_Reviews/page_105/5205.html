    I know it&#039;s unjustifiable to give an 8 to an anime that has a GOD DAMN AWFUL FIRST EPISODE but before you hover that mouse pointer on top of the &quot;Not Helpful&quot; vote, please do take the time in actually reading this first.<br />

Harem would probably be my least favored genre as this includes the generic moe/ecchi or whatever fanservice they could come up. I might also disfavor the said genre because of the fans which consists mainly of the typical perverted otaku who faps to his 2D waifu. Nonetheless, I still push myself to watch anime of the harem genre in hopes of finding something

          <span style="display: none;" id="review38092">
        different. Though skeptical at first, I was amazed on how Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai turned to be.<br />
<br />
First and foremost, Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai or simply OreTsuba, is nothing more of your typical harem. It is idiotic. It doesn’t make sense. It leaps from scene to scene. It is filled with generic tropes and stereotypes. It is overloaded with panty shots. It has a cast filled with idiots and perverts. It is absurd. Now most people would jump the gun and say it is nothing out of the generic harem and moe crap we see everyday and drop it at episode 1. That is undeniably true, given the first episode had a huge cast filled with cute girls or moe-blobs so to speak. However, OreTsuba is not one anime that presents its real facet in its premise. It needs a distinct amount of time for a viewer to understand what it’s all about. The outside generic harem appearance is only a means to fool the viewer to think that OreTsuba is one harem badly done but no, there is something much more to it.<br />
<br />
Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai is based off a visual novel which was developed by the company Navel. Having a visual novel as a source material would mean cute girls that could either range from lolis to the older sister type. Unlike other harem/ecchi anime that won’t mind the appearance of the characters as long as there are panty shots or the so called fanservice to render, OreTsuba is quite more attracting as it had its visuals done neatly and it probably is its selling point. The character designs were very appealing and the backgrounds were fluid. It somehow incorporates real-world scenes to the 2D world of OreTsuba making it have a 3D feel of the background which is quite nice. As for the production value of this anime, I believe it is quite high seeing that the characters and backgrounds were something much more than the usual; even the design of the school uniform was obviously done with effort.<br />
<br />
Along with the clean and cutesy character designs would be the truckload of fanservice scenes. There would be no 5 minute that would pass by without a decent amount of panty shots. For having cute and adorable character designs, the fanservice were not as distracting as some might think, in fact it blends in pretty well. I know majority of those who’ve dropped this might be because of the ridiculous fanservice but by all means, try to give it one more chance and if you can see pass through that you’ll see the fruits of it afterwards. As for the pervs who continued watching this, I’m a 100% sure by now that you’ve realized that it actually has a worthwhile plot.<br />
<br />
Though it may contain tons of it, this is not an anime about panty shots, it is the story of 3 young gentlemen namely: Takashi Haneda, Shuusuke Chitose and Hayato Narita. Having 3 male leads led to an ef - a tale of memories reminiscence and it is actually how the story goes; 3 young male characters paired with 3 young female characters only in OreTsuba, it is quite less serious, random and perverted. <br />
<br />
First off, Takashi Haneda is paired with Asuka Watarai. Asuka is basically the typical campus crush who has no personality or whatsoever only that she acts like a respected princess. As for Takashi, he’s the typical school boy who actually has no personality too except that he’s a good boy and the somewhat cowardly lead. Basically they are cardboard cut-outs which is undoubtedly one of the weakest asset that OreTsuba could display affecting their chemistry which is rather poor. <br />
<br />
One of the better couples would be Hayato Narita’s pair with Naru Ootori. Hayato Narita is a delinquent whose friends are gang members and the like. He works exclusively at night doing what other people would tell him to do. As for Naru, she’s the younger sister of a gang leader. She’s a somewhat shy little girl who took interest in Hayato after helping her in finding a lost bike. As the story goes, Hayato and Naru’s pair would look like the cutest with their cutesy and lovely interactions, with Hayato protecting Naru from other people although at the same time the weirdest of the bunch as it is a delinquent paired up with a loli. <br />
<br />
The third pair and the best in my opinion would be the pair-up of Shuusuke Chitose and Hiyoko Tamaizumi. Shuusuke works as an article reviewer for a local magazine. He’s the typical boisterous and jolly happy-go-lucky pervert. Hiyoko on the other hand is the serious type of girl who writes novels. As for why they are the best; the anime focused more on their development and as well as for their relationship to enhance. Shuusuke helps Hiyoko achieve her dream of being a successful novelist while at the same time, the feelings of Hiyoko develop more and more for Shuusuke. Watching them both mature, though stupid and nonsensical at times, is really a treat.<br />
<br />
Aside from the 3 pairs, there are a lot more characters in OreTsuba. However, not all are of importance as some only serve their roles as mere plot devices. Some if not plot devices serve as a part of the mindless comic relief the anime has. Although it has mindless comedy, that is only for itself, the comedy. As it is backed with stupidity and senselessness, it is deceiving.  The plot is actually well thought out or so to say ingenious that needs well analyzing to place in the correct pieces.<br />
<br />
As aforementioned, the story rotates around the 3 pairs. There is something much more and this something is very unusual for an anime of this type. As harems are very predictable, throw any expectations in the gutter as this isn’t. Aside from the genre tags which include: Drama, Ecchi, Romance, and Harem; it is missing one more, and this genre is Psychological. First impressions might conclude that it is very predictable. Wait until you’ve reached episode 4 which includes a sudden plot twist and you’ll know what you’re getting. However after that, seeing the first scene at episode 1, some will say that they already know where this is leading but I would suggest keeping your thoughts to yourself because I know the outcome of this anime will leave you in awe because of its unpredictability. It does well in disguising itself as a harem and an idiotic one at that to deceive its viewers in thinking that this is their run-of-the-mill rom-com.<br />
<br />
Having started as maybe one of the stupidest anime I have seen, I’m amazed with how it turned the tables with a single deus ex machina done amazingly near the end making everything fall into place. With just one snap and then boom, everything was revealed, everything was answered, everything makes sense. It answered everything completely without any cliffhangers that would require millions of hypotheses to answer.<br />
<br />
Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai might not be your generic harem but accompanying it is the somewhat generic music. Although generic, they are still highly likeable. The opening song entitled “Spread Wings” by Aki Misato which is cute and lovely which perfectly fits a harem setting. The first ending song entitled “PARANoiA” by the same songstress, accompanied by a video of knights, beasts and RPG-like adventure has quite an easy feel to it while the second ending song “NEVERLAND” is well, just the same as usual which is expected from a harem.<br />
<br />
As for the voice actors, some sounded really annoying. Some sounded like someone who’s wearing a nose clip. Some were screechy. As for the remaining others, they were good which is somewhat above average or if not, just average. Along with the voices were the soundtracks. Well, for a loud and crazy anime, it is expected that the soundtracks used were loud and funky as well, which suits the lively and energetic atmosphere albeit sometimes as well as it had its fun moments, it also contains boring and “unfunny” scenes.<br />
<br />
It had its dull moments, there are times when it tries too hard to be funny, and there are those times when it’s just plain downright stupid. Looking past through that, this light and fluffy feathery ride which is called Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai is one unique experience. Predictable and stupid as some might dub harem to be; stupid is true but predictable was nowhere near. A definite must watch for harem fans. Now they have something to brag about harem; that it’s not all about ecchi/moe or anything in between. And as for those who are not into harems (including me), I guess I could safely say that Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai is a “Do not judge the book by its cover” or more like “Harems although of the same feather, do not always flock together… because some of them don’t have wings.” (Yeah it&#039;s that random)<br />

    Once upon a time the world considered mental illness to be a taboo subject, so much so that those who suffered were often shunned or locked away, and it was often the case that stories dealing with the issue were thought of as ... controversial. Nowadays there is greater understanding of the ailments of the mind, and with that has come a rise in the number of tales featuring the subject as a central theme. That said, there is a tendency to focus on clinical depression, schizophrenia, psychosis, and other well known illnesses, which may seem a little odd until one realises that the most

          <span style="display: none;" id="review38477">
        commonly fictionalised ailments have one underlying connection - they all made the national news. The press is rife with tales of psychopaths, suicides, serial killers and more, and while there are stories that are based on one (or more), of the lesser known mental illnesses, the majority of authors and screenwriters will immediately utilise those that the public finds familiar.<br />
<br />
Based on the eroge of the same name by Navel, Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai (We Without Wings) – Under the Innocent Sky (or OreTsuba as it&#039;s more commonly known), follows the daily lives of Haneda Takashi, Chitose Shuusuke and Narita Hayato, three young men living in the city of Yanagihara. Each leads a life that is very different to the other two, and at first they seem to have no connection to one another ...<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s about as clear as things get for quite a few episodes.<br />
<br />
From the outset there&#039;s no apparent direction or focus to the plot, and this continues until late in the series, at which point the shape of a storyline begins to appear. Now given the ultimate focus of the narrative one might argue that the somewhat dizzying sequence of events during the first half of OreTsuba are a purposeful attempt to elicit a sympathetic reaction from the audience by making them confused and uncomfortable. Unfortunately that sort of reasoning is a bit too far fetched in the cold light of day as the story appears to have been written by someone with little to no knowledge of mental illness whatsoever. In addition to that one does have to question the sanity of the person who decided an ecchi, harem romantic comedy was the best vehicle for a narrative where the core themes are not only being mentally ill, but also how it affects those around you.<br />
<br />
Speaking of harems ...<br />
<br />
OreTsuba features an array of characters who are paraded across the screen like pedigrees at a dog show, and the sheer number can initially seem impressive until one realises that the majority of them are nothing more than window dressing. There&#039;s little in the way of actual development going on, which wouldn&#039;t be a bad thing if some effort had been put into defining the characters from the start, so it&#039;s unfortunate that this is yet another anime populated by cardboard cutouts. Even worse is that almost every opportunity for growth or added definition during the first half of the series is wasted on stock events that grace many an ecchi harem tale, and while the latter portion of the story does present a few interesting scenarios, these are not enough to raise the show from mediocrity.<br />
<br />
If nothing else, OreTsuba is consistent in that the generic characters and plot tokens are very clearly reflected in the acting, and unrealistic voices abound in this series. The lead roles seem to lose interest in the project after the first episode and appear to perform little more than lines by rote for the rest of the series, but maybe it&#039;s not the fault of the seiyuu as the dialogue is sorely lacking in originality and imagination.<br />
<br />
This apparent lack of creativity also extends to the music, and many of the background tracks are of the type that one might find in just about every other ecchi harem romantic comedy, including the pieces used in Gretagard. The opening and ending themes are no better, and OreTsuba manages to uphold the best traditions of eroge and dating sim adaptations by finding the most generic J-pop tracks it can for the series OP and ED.<br />
<br />
Now given that this is an adaptation there&#039;s an inherent limitation placed on design, and while that isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing for some shows, viewers should remember what the source material actually is. The problem is that OreTsuba, like so many other eroge and datings sims, uses a stock set of character designs that have gone beyond a simple stereotype, and are now more of a hallmark for these types of story. In addition to this the animation is workman-like, and that blandness is most prominent when the character are undertaking some sort of frenetic activity.<br />
<br />
In all honesty Nomad, like so many studios before them, appear to have been unable to muster the effort to produce a good looking series.<br />
<br />
On a side note, one of the most annoying things about OreTsuba is that the visuals sometimes show a few flashes of original thinking, but these moments are often derailed or buried completely by the sudden and pointless introduction of fanservice. There are far too many occasions where events are progressing in an interesting manner when all of a sudden the screen is covered with underwear or jiggling ... things.<br />
<br />
So is OreTsuba enjoyable?<br />
<br />
Well, the story lacks any real charm or grace and the core theme has been handled in a far more sensitive manner by Mahoraba ~Heartful Days~. In addition to that, the seemingly mindless adherence to the stereotypical production methods of eroge and datings sim adaptations and the overabundance of pointless fanservice actually detract from any efforts to move the plot in a more meaningful direction. The simple fact is that OreTsuba is about as subtle and sensitive as a hammer to the face, and one event in particular highlights this as there&#039;s nothing in the series up to that point to justify the sudden revelation that one of the characters had an imaginary little brother.<br />
<br />
OreTsuba is a singular example of pretty much everything that&#039;s wrong with the anime industry these days, which is actually the only good thing about it. Watching the series is far more work than it should be, and while the source material appears to have been written and designed by people who like to wear jackets with lots of straps and really long sleeves, that&#039;s no excuse for a poorly executed adaptation. There are many ways the series could have been handled (as Tears To Tiara proved), but it looks like nobody really cared enough about this anime to make the effort.<br />
<br />
So the only question left is why on earth was it made in the first place?

    Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai, simply put, is probably the most confusing anime I have ever watched. The one weird thing for me, is that this is kind of my “guilty pleasure” anime. I know it’s horrible, but I enjoyed it for some reason despite not knowing what the fuck was going on for over half of the 12 episodes. I give it a 9/10 on my list simply because there I rate things based on enjoyment, but I’ll be more critical in this review.<br />
<br />
Plot – 5/10<br />
<br />
What Oretachi attempts to do is to put a twist on the usual “harem” genre where three or more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review96231">
        girls fall in love with one guy. I won’t explain much of the plot because, honestly, I don’t necessarily understand much of it myself. <br />
<br />
Art – 8/10<br />
<br />
I thought the characters designs were pretty good. It’s kind of a mix between seinen and shounen so it’s not too much of either. The only problem is maybe some odd colors for school clothes and some weird gang member in the earlier episodes with a bizarre design. The art of the city they live in which I suppose is Tokyo is fine though it doesn’t stand out as being exceptional.<br />
<br />
Music – 8/10<br />
<br />
I don’t count Openings and Endings in reviews but I just want to mention that I really like this show’s opening since it was what initially convinced me to watch this show. But the music during the episodes isn’t anything remarkable, just kind of average like the art so not much to talk about.<br />
<br />
Characters – 7/10<br />
<br />
The characters are interesting, but pretty stereotypical. There’s girls working in a maid café, a loli or two, and the main personality-split guy. There are three main characters and one not-as-important character. The problem here being that the not-as-important one is one the most hilarious and amazing minor characters I’ve ever seen. He only really gets an appearance in one episode (I believe 7) but it makes it the best episode of the series. You could honestly just watch that episode, laugh, and go on to watch something better as far as I’m concerned if you don’t want to be extremely confused.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment – 9/10<br />
<br />
I did enjoy this show. As much as I was confused and noticed how bad it was, I liked it for no reason that I can explain. Hey, we all have some show like that don’t we, something we know we shouldn’t like but still do? This isn’t one of my favorite shows by a long shot, but I’m glad I watched it. Still I wouldn’t recommend it, since I doubt many other people would feel the same weird feelings about this show that I did, but if you want to go for it. At least try episode 7, it had me laughing non-stop and it’s basically a filler episode so not too much problem in getting caught up on the events of the story.

    This anime is a wonderfully depicted coming of age tale for all ages. The three main characters  Narita, Takashi and Chitose bring a spectrum of personalities when combined make the perfect comic trio and with the added flashy fan service and witty and sarcastic humor this anime has everything a that makes a good slice of life series. The story mostly revolves around these three young men just reaching adult hood and coping with it in a real way that is rateable but spiced up by some very attractive female attention  that may help these young boys find their way to manhood. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35797">
        ladies are loveable and the young men are just as endearing.<br />
<br />
The overall story seems solid and it has good modern comic relief, the artwork is very good and detailed, flashy at times ( especially during a cute ecchi moment) and yet has a modern abstract twist at times.<br />
<br />
the music has more of a blues rock feel to it modern as the rest of the anime - the opening a tune by a so-called - DJ Conrad, has a pleasant tune and the background music to most scenes are just perfect. The anime was well put together from artwork to story line to music, to character design. A good anime to keep an eye on. I&#039;ve not read the comic but I can tell by this first episode that this will be a winner.

    So i just finished OreTsuba for the 5th time and i spent an entire hour writing a review (and then closed it by accident so this is the 2nd take and i&#039;m not even gonna bother trying to sound smart like all these other kids do) even tho i normally don&#039;t write reviews or care about reviews or about monkeys that get infuenced by reviews but this anime is so good that if my review made 1 more person watch it, it&#039;d be worth it<br />
<br />
This anime is the best, not even exaggerating. I have no reason to be biased and i only watch animes for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275530">
        entertainment and i have plenty of other shit to do so if you think fanboying over some random stuff on the internet is healthy or good for me you better think twice, the only reason i&#039;m saying it is because its actually true - i still have yet to see a better anime than Oretachi ni tsubasa wa Nai and when you read this you should have in mind that at the end of the day this is a comedy, romance, ecchi anime so you can&#039;t possibly watch this and expect robots or space exploration or some shit like that so if you&#039;re going to hate on it only cause its an ecchi then you have some issues - no one is forcing you to watch animes that you normally don&#039;t enjoy just like how i don&#039;t watch animes that i normally don&#039;t enjoy. Oretsuba is awesome for its genre and discriminating it based on genre is stupid and i seriously don&#039;t see how can i rate this any lower <br />
<br />
The art is 10/10, the anime was made seven years ago (2011) and it still looks better than animes coming out to this year. The backgrounds are detailed and well-drawn and the waifus are top tier and you can&#039;t really get better art, just different, which is subjective and taste based so my rating of its art is based on the execution not the style but i do like the style as well cus they&#039;re cute af. <br />
<br />
The sound is 10/10, there&#039;s barely a single character who&#039;s voice annoys me a bit but all others sound perfect, they also sound unique (not like other animes where everyone sounds like a character from another anime) and the background music is actually good as well so the production value is quite high<br />
<br />
The plot to me is 10/10, mainly because of how it&#039;s portrayed but the story is also good and a believable one. The portrayal of the story is unique and it&#039;s also a big confusing which is why you shouldn&#039;t watch this anime on autopilot else you&#039;ll get angry cus you&#039;re a lil triggerlord. It does take a few episodes to ramp up and become a bit more clear on your first watch but if you pay attention perhaps you&#039;ll be surprised in a good way instead of confused little rage god diva<br />
<br />
Characters? Well - 10/10 obviously. There are a ton of characters in this anime and most of them are awesome and the only &#039;downside&#039; is that we don&#039;t really get to know any of them that well but for the amount of time we see them they are clearly defined and good. I don&#039;t think the length of the anime is a downside as well because i think that the anime&#039;s story progression is perfect and doesn&#039;t feel slow or rushed and this may not be the best anime to get overly-attached to some of the characters but nonetheless they&#039;re still good.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is based on a visual novel but it doesn&#039;t really matter what its based on as we&#039;re only reviewing the anime and the only thing that matters is the anime and how good that was. I&#039;ve seen a lot of people complain over bad adaptations or manga being better and what not but this doesn&#039;t matter at all when you&#039;re talking about anime so i don&#039;t think the VN has anything to do to the anime and what i&#039;m judging and rating what i saw so i&#039;m not going to get biased over visual novel this visual novel that.<br />
<br />
Despite the overwhelming amount of fanservice the anime is actually grown up, the characters are grown up and they also swear and insult a lot plus they&#039;re members of a gang and there&#039;s actually some violence (well it&#039;s not that big of a deal) and i actually believe that the creators are grown up and reasonable as well, unlike most other animes where you&#039;re thinking &quot;wtf who made this character dude?&quot; I dont think the fanservice is triggering or anything like that, if you&#039;re getting triggered by small stuff like this you should re-think your internet life cus it doesn&#039;t sound very healthy. Just take it with a smile or something. The humor is absolutely fantastic, i&#039;ve seen it five times and i still laugh at the jokes (altho it was over the years so it&#039;s not like i remembered everything down to the last line)<br />
<br />
<br />
This is NOT your typical harem no matter what others are saying, i&#039;ve seen a lot of typical harems and most of them have a ton of unreasonable characters or a garbage story or both and most of them are full of kids or teens which isn&#039;t the case here. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t think the anime ever tries too hard or forces things too much, to me it felt completely natural and it never felt like a drag like a lot of other animes do. The last episodes were wrapped up nicely as well (unlike most other animes.. again) and finishing it leaves me with a good feeling in my tummy instead with annoyance <br />
<br />
I did read a bit of people&#039;s thoughts to understand oretsuba&#039;s low score and it seems like some people are blaming the anime for them not understanding the anime which is dumb as hell. I understand the anime so there&#039;s clearly no problem with that, don&#039;t blame something else if you&#039;re the problem in the first place. I also read some people comparing this masterpiece to some garbage and saying that this is bad cause it has pantsu shots, seriously? How does a pantsu-shot make the story irrelevant? You know panties exist in real life too right? At the end of the day this is a comedy and an ecchi anime so these two things are expected and it&#039;s supposed to make you smile not rage and perhaps you don&#039;t need comedy but a mental treatment if things like this annoy you.<br />
<br />
<br />
I will almost certainly re-watch this anime in the future as Japan seems to prefer to release some utterly forgettable garbage as most of the stuff that&#039;s airing right now (that&#039;s almost a pain to watch and if not that it&#039;s also incredibly ugly with a low budget art , which simply isn&#039;t the case here) and we&#039;re not helping them by letting kids down-rate masterpieces like this. I was watching Oretsuba while it was airing and it had 6.8/10 before half of the anime was even released and that makes absolutely no sense as the story wasn&#039;t even remotely developed by then but then again this is democracy so everyone can vote and everyone has an equal voice. The farmer&#039;s vote is the same as the Doctor&#039;s vote even if the subject at hand is actual medicine so that goes to show you how stupid democracy is and why you should never trust the majority of people.. simply because they&#039;re not qualified to judge correctly (and yet they still do).<br />
<br />
Watch this anime if you&#039;re into FUN and CUTE GIRLS and ROMANCE (those 3 things are basically the point of life). I can&#039;t find a better one, you probably won&#039;t as well. Hell this anime even has diversity (not that i care), there are black people and there are gay people what more do you want? <br />
<br />
Don&#039;t watch this anime if you&#039;re a little rage-god diva and if you hate laughing and fun. I&#039;d say &quot;and cute girls&quot; but this anime actually has good male characters so even if you dont care about cute girls there&#039;s more than that in here!

    One major lesson I learned from this anime is to stick with what you got, and man was I glad i stuck with this rollercoaster ride.<br />
<br />
At the beginning, there were many things to throw people off during the ride, such as: random conversations, random segways, random overdose shots of blatant fan services; but I gripped onto the handle bar that is my sanity tight and I gotta say: MORE!!! (after every eps from 5 onward.)<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT THERE IS NOT A SINGLE BORING MOMENT WITHIN THIS SERIES. As the anime progresses, everything about every points made during the ride converge onto one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37403">
        solid plot: the random conversations to distinguish the characters, the random segways made blends as the plot thickens, and cant say much about the fan service...it&#039;s an anime based on an Hgame.<br />
<br />
I recommend this anime. This isn&#039;t the usual Hgame based storyline where the protagonist moved ti a town, pimps out all the girls there but couldn&#039;t do so back in his previous location, and lives to tell the story. This anime tells the story with many colorful casts with individual personalities as they traverse their roads toward one single focal point.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m riding this coaster the full way.

    About:<br />
<br />
This is one of those anime based on a novel simulator, but with a somewhat different story, because it involves the main character with three different personalities. The game is produced by Navel (Shouffle!) and the direction the anime is done by Shinji Ushiru, the director of the Campanella Shukufuku. There are also manga being published in various magazines throughout Japan The story about a boy who has multiple personalities (apparently 4), but three stand out: Takashi Haneda, Narita and Hayato Shuusuke Chitose. The story unfolds with a complicated plot and scenes packed with fanservice, each personality has a group of friends and a special

        girl, over the episodes, the stories will be crossing and in episode 11 no longer has its own history<br />
<br />
What I saw:<br />
<br />
Oretsuba was not one of those works that excel in understanding of who attends, is right in trying to be non-sense and show a lot of panties and bras out there. It&#039;s a bit difficult to make an analysis of the anime, because I really did not understand a damn thing this story pointless and extremely stressed. It starts bad, gets ugly in their own half and goes through the penultimate episode as the largest Japanese crap I&#039;ve ever seen. It&#039;s ridiculous when you see the officers trying to solve all the problems in the last two episodes, 10 episodes of which were full of bitching and no history. What&#039;s the fun of a lot of heroines delayed offering to the main character? Does the game is as bad as the anime? I do not know!<br />
You can watch Oretsuba another 10 times and still not understand bulhufas pretty common in a non-sense of quality, a non-sense that does not really make sense and make the audience laugh and think &quot;What the fuck&quot; thing that this design does not cause: You do not questioned nor fun. I honestly do not know how I endured (even with an umlaut!) Follow the anime for this long, like a story made by me in writing classes; legal traveled for 10 episodes and wanted to be smart in the last 2 episodes.<br />

    &quot;May the world know peace&quot; is the key qoute of this series.<br />
<br />
This series is one multiple personality disorder gone berserk, well not really berserk just pretty much loopy, basically it pretty much takes you on a trippy ride which will have you confuse as to which side is up or left.. Even that line didn&#039;t make sense. But got to say this series was a bit surprising I honestly thought this had a dark element to it, but actually it was pretty light, by the way this anime is superrr ecchi so for those who don&#039;t like gropping some tittay, white stuff on girls, or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review169453">
        girls accidently falling and revealing all their glory then I got news for you, you have a functioning brain... Not I kidded of course but seriously stay away if you&#039;re not an ecchi fan, and for those who are oh give this one a go. Anyways time for the review K ok lets gooo!<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
Not the first anime to implement Multiple Personality Disorder, but it&#039;s one of those that can take that kind of subject and make it laughable. The story is about a boy name Youji Haneda who basically can say locked himself away from the world, however to keep his little sister happy Kobato Haneda, three new personality kicks in to keep her happy or in this case to implement the phase &quot;may the world know peace&quot; they take the form of Takashi a submissive and sickly boy who escapes into a fantasy world, Shuusuke a what do you call those a one directioner impersonator? Nah he&#039;s just a charmer boy, and last but not least Hayato, so like a emo-ish dark fella kind of but not really... Oh by the way there is a fourth one Karura a king who is a little coo-coo if ya ask me. Anyways the story really revolves around those three more and each of them with their own little side-quest and a lovely lady to keep them company if ya know what I mean ;). <br />
<br />
Art: 7 <br />
Pretty generic but at the same well-done, each character looked thoughfully made and not like they were thrown together like if they were frankenstein.. The animation was great easy on the eyes and kepted steady to keep the lightness of the show which was good then again the characters during the serious moment was also animated beautifully.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5<br />
I feel like I have heard half of those background music before but can&#039;t seem to remember from where, so as originality goes it was a thumps-down but then again it fit well with the anime, however the opening was good not great but it was good.. The voice acting, well since I listened to it in english dubbed I can just say it was well, characters and voices fit well with each other so no complain I should try and listen to japanese version see which one is better but for now emglish dub was good. <br />
<br />
Characters: 7<br />
Even though the real developement was Youji and it was focus on him I still felt that the characters around him we&#039;re very well developed to the point that there was no need for a character change for anyone because all the characters fight in so well, the only one that needed to knock some sense into was Youji, cause Takashi, Shuusuke, and Hayato were all great and olayed their roles well enough said.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
Um hello fanservice! What else can I say even an almost H-scene not once but twice and I didn&#039;t felt weird about it hurray!! But seriously it was enjoyable, it was funny to watch it had me laughing in every episode. I could&#039;ve finished this series in one sitting but being busy and not wanting to finish it so fast I had to delay it but honestly I just want to watch more of it.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7<br />
It was a good series not gonna lie but like I said in the intro its very ecchi so if that&#039;s not your thing then you&#039;re not going to enjoy it unless you can tolerate it then good for you. But for those who don&#039;t care and you just want to watch something new or ecchi or funny or just don&#039;t care you just want to watch anything cause you&#039;re so damn bored! Well give this series a try and hopefully you&#039;ll get the same thrilling experience and for those who don&#039;t and disagree with me well I apologies for the inconvenience.

    This anime is quite difficult to review in my style, might even contain spoilers for people who are planning to watch this series. Anyways here I’ll try reviewing this series in the best way I can think off.<br />
<br />
Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai (or We Without Wings – Under the Innocent Sky) might fool everyone into thinking that this series is nothing but a generic harem theme show centered around three guys and their swarm of moe girls – true, and there is a lot of panty shots and even borderline hentai scenes and it didn’t help that the first episode is full of confusion with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review41933">
        the presentation of all three male characters each has his own story and harem and is seemingly completely unrelated to each other. Viewers with enough patience and tolerance though on the extremely high number of seemingly pointless fanservice shots every 3-5min will find the next couple of episodes still the same thing until around episode 4 when something is hinted at the final moments…all of the sudden the series began to make sense and became so much interesting to watch.<br />
<br />
For those viewers who have no idea but is interested in knowing what is happening on the main character Haneda Takashi, he is most likely suffering a psychiatric disorder that is keenly close to what is called “Dissociative Identity Disorder.” A major feature of this disorder is the existence of two or more personalities or identities that take control of the person’s behavior. The person, or “host,” is unaware of the other personalities, but the other personalities may be aware of each other in varying degrees. [1][2][3][4][5][6]<br />
[see below for some notes]<br />
<br />
The series attempts with varying success to connect the different stories of the many different personalities inside of Haneda Takashi and made a fairly satisfying conclusion. It is sad that the ending is an open ended meaning the viewers wouldn’t see an official couple at the end, but I think it’s good in the sense that knowing how many girls are involved on the many different personalities, each a very strong candidate as the “worthy girl” it will surely a heartache to see them all cry.<br />
<br />
The animation of the series is not very sharp indicating that this series may be a small budgeted one. Motion fluidity isn’t that good either as character movements look very unnatural and somewhat suffering from poor frame rate. In addition, the environment is not detailed and the character designs look generic. The good thing about the animation though is the girls, they are very cute and sexy looking which looks really nice and is probably the main reason why the series has to many fanservice/panty shots, simply put it – the girls have great assets which they aren’t shy exposing to the camera.<br />
<br />
The music and the opening and ending are pretty decent to listen but not something that is worth listening too every episode. The series contains forgettable but decent BGMs to supplement the animation scenes. Voice acting is pretty unnatural with most of the girls but somehow it matches their character designs and personalities so kudos to the voice actresses for doing a very good job altering their voices to meet the desired voices of the characters they are portraying.<br />
<br />
The series has a fairly huge amount of characters, the viewers can see why: The many personalities of the main character each has his own story and adventure to tell and each of them has fairly unique meetings and interactions with a lot of people (ahem mostly girls!). Viewers looking for character development may be disappointed on this especially if they become attached to a particular character, it is a given, but the series made a very good job in giving this characters their very own brief moments that is worthwhile to watch.<br />
<br />
Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai is a fairly unique find. Granted it has everything what a generic harem and fanservice focus anime has, still it did a good job incorporating a story that focuses on a particular psychiatric disorder that is quite believable and made it in such a way that is entertaining and fun to watch in some extent. Highly recommended for viewers who like fanservice/ecchi themed series that has a fair bit of romance, some intrigue, and of course large amount of panty shots.<br />

[1] The text is taken from the “Psychiatric Nursing, Mosby, Third Edition” by Keltner, Schwecke, and Bostrom <br />
[2] Additional reading can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder<br />
[3] A Hollywood movie with similar theme can be found here: Identity (2003) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309698/<br />
[4] An anime that exhibit an almost similar disorder found in this series is the character “Shiki” from “Kara no Kyoukai”.<br />
[5] Pls. note that I’m not really sure if Haneda is suffering from the said disorder. I’m a registered nurse (not a physician) but I’m not specialized in Pyschiatric Nursing (I’m practicing Medical Intensive Care), so whatever I wrote in this review may not be correct at all. In addition to Haneda, there are also some characters that may be suffering from psychiatric like-disorder: Ootori Kakeru is somewhat suffering the same disorder like Haneda but to a lesser extent;<br />
[6] Asuka Wataranai is hinted that at some point in her childhood she suffered a disorder but most likely just “imaginary friend” which occurs fairly normal to a developing child (but not her age in the scenes where she describes to Haneda about her past).

    Before I begin my review I must give you some of my viewpoints about the anime.. One, do NOT form your impression of this anime on only the first 2-3 episodes or on someone&#039;s view who has only watched 2-3 episodes; Two, after you begin watching the anime try to remember exactly, if you can, the names and faces of characters in the first 2 episodes cause it will get complicated later on; Three, do not get confused by the random events as many of them don&#039;t have too much of a deep significance. Four, and this may seem weird initially but I strongly suggest

          <span style="display: none;" id="review38798">
        that you watch the anime till the end. It has a nice innovative approach towards developing a romance-ecchi-harem(?) scenario.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s winter in the big city of Yanagihara, and young people will meet and fall in love. Takashi is a boy who plans to escape to another world, but is held back by thoughts of his younger sister Kobato and girlfriend Asuka. Shusuke is a poor part-timer who has to work with student-author Hiyoko in spite of their initial dislike for each other. The antisocial Hayato makes his living as a handyman until he is visited by a girl name Naru. These young men begin to develop a sort of relationship with those girls even though, apparently, they can&#039;t become too serious and involved because their time is limited... Also, they have a mysterious link among themselves.<br />
<br />
The narration is random and weird, at least that&#039;s how it seems in the beginning. DJ condor narrates the tales as if they were being captured on camera of some reality show, they change channels to go to a different scene. There is random fan-service in the beginning and in between scenes and the plot does have a somewhat haphazard flow and confusing sequence of events.. So, for the first two episodes though you get something out of the individual events you&#039;ll hardly be able to link them to grasp the general flow or the bigger picture of events. But slowly as the plot progresses you will get accustomed to the weird narration style and grasp more of the theme.. the central theme is brilliant, its not something unbelievable but it is definitely creative and has been dealt with with unparalleled dexterity to maintain the mystery and slow plot exposition. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s good use of satire and comedy (Gretacalibur, weird statements, stupid assertions and whatever goes.. xD), particularly watch ep7. The plot uses multiple elements of slice of life, fantasy, romance, ecchi, urban culture, comedy -- the fusion of genres is nice to watch and also aids in developing a sense of ambiguity and mysterious atmosphere that is essential to the plot. This means that while for most part you&#039;ll see romantic encounters, daily life events, ecchi scenes and some classic romance-ecchi-comedy events you&#039;ll also get to see urban gangs and culture, fantasy battles, mysterious people and the like. What it gives you is a &#039;metaphorical&#039; (or illusionary) sense of multiple worlds existing in the same city connected by unexpected means. This is important to the essence of the plot because it depicts what separates and connects the male protagonists.<br />
<br />
Though many may ridicule or dislike the narration style I think it adds a nice taste to the story, it is queer like sweet-and-spicy but its worth a taste. Plus if the story had been left as is, it would have become too plain or too formula-based to be anything special. I like the experimenting they did even if the results aren&#039;t spectacular. The plot in its core has a psychological basis. A theme that takes the developing romance an almost converts it into harem. But even though it basically hinges on a psychological concept its not something gore or deranged, its something simpler with interesting (if not stunning) consequences. The ending is good but it mellows the entire prospect on which the story was built and it&#039;ll also give to you all the answers you desire in three letters ???.<br />
<br />
[!!SPOILER!!<br />
What happens to a boy faced with great shock and guilt in childhood? Remorseful, but he cannot abandon his only sister.. takes refuge in an unending dark abyss so he doesn&#039;t face others, invents an altruistic personality to look after her sister.. and when even that fails? invent others to reside in the &#039;cockpit&#039;? It is also impressive that one of the &#039;invented&#039; personalities has his own delusions! a delusion within a delusion?!!  MPD?ISH?]<br />
<br />
Though not apparent, the story stunningly depicts how a child&#039;s experiences, surroundings and events around him come together to define his psychology; to create a dark refuge, a world of fantasy, ideals of peace and upholders of justice. This is one of the features which impressed me a lot.. how everything relating to the other world formed as a product of a child&#039;s mentality from something simple as his video games and his church visits.<br />
<br />
<br />
The art is great. There is a prevalent of CG, nice sketches with well-defined proportions ( bishoujo, some pronounced curves but most within acceptable range) , good backgrounds and sharp graphics with good sense of color. The coloring scheme is mostly bright but it sways to some darkened, shaded or dim-lighted scenes for instance during urban gang-wars, graffiti scenes etc. Fan-service scenes abound, they&#039;re random but not absurd, and use of yellow caution tapes gives a distinctive feel. Fighting scenes aren&#039;t serious but more humorous in depiction. The animation is fluid and smooth. The soundtracks are good enough though nothing special. The OP &#039;Spread Wings&#039; is great and EDs are fine.<br />
<br />
The characters have been fleshed out well. Author has a strong understanding of the personalities he wants to depict and good insight.The male protagonists can swap personalities in the same body. The way male leads are introduced and developed each of them retains their individuality and defines his own behavior distinctly, despite being exchanged one after another. It is great (and also humorous). Their roles, their emotions and purpose is well defined, Takashi is a simple-shy-altruistic character, the usual hero kind but bound by some of his own troubles which he doesn&#039;t reveal. His coupling with the class beauty Asuka is so.. cliched. Hayato&#039;s cool delinquent appearance, arrogant attitude is not something new but his coupling with Naru sure is, its weird to go searching for a stupid bicycle witha girl every night. Chitose Shuusuke is the most lively male protagonist, he&#039;s the unpopular guy who gets involved with the weird Tamaizumi while lurking after many other girls. His actions, thoughts and developments seemed the most interesting. The random situations when he swaps personalities, his stupid conversations but skilled criticism and sudden outburst set him as among the best developed characters. The main attraction about the male protagonists is not about their characters but more abut how they exchange personalities and the situations they are in.<br />
<br />
In contrast the female cast scores mainly due to characterization. Leave Asuka out of this, because apart from the scene where she beats the shit out of the protagonist there isn&#039;t much interesting. Naru&#039;s seemingly air-headed but actually a little weird and assertive (a personal opinion), she&#039;s lively and well portrayed. Tamaizumi, shines brighter in my opinion, a tsundere but sometimes dangerous and sometimes perverted; she has a fresh touch to herself. The minor cast may not have much development but a lot of them are very well-depicted and used.<br />
 For her anastrophe, also Alice I like.<br />
<br />
<br />
The anime provides sort of a roller-coaster ride: you get interested, confused, frustrated and finally hooked. I think it is fairly enjoyable and has some queer taste. I liked it more when I watched it a second time, cause many events were clearer.<br />
<br />
The initial impression may be fuzzy and queer but the final impression is great. The story is able to fulfill its purpose clearly in 12 episodes and hardly leaves many plot holes. Some events may be difficult to comprehend but the plot improves with each episode and has a good re-watch value (which is surprisingly due some of the confusion it creates). Definitely recommended for Romance-ecchi-harem fans, among the best and the innovative ones in the genre.<br />
<br />

    Since the beginning of mankind mental illnesses have been the bane of people since they could not be treated, let alone cured. This series begins with three story lines about three different people that begin to mix at a certain point. First episodes require a lot of attention since it doesn&#039;t make any sense other than showing everyday life of some regular people, however if you patiently watch and gather the facts you will see how easy it is to put them together.<br />
<br />
This is what I like about this anime that it actually makes you do some brain work other than speculating on the plot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review92859">
        while enjoying its well made artwork. I believe it is necessary for a good anime to balance its plot with its artwork in order for it to be appealing.<br />

    Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai is a very ambitious anime. However, it also happens to be a harem comedy that really wants to pander to that otaku audience. The result? A total and utter mess that has a lot of good things about it.<br />
<br />
Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai tells the tale of three young men and their life in the city and their connections to the people around them. That&#039;s more or less all I can say without spoiling this, as it takes until the very end of episode 4 for things to start making at least a little sense in this show. <br />
<br />
Before I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review118401">
        go into the plot, I just want to say that Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai has not just the best, the the second best harem protagonists of all time in it. Most harem protagonists are dull and have no personality, but for two of our three heroes, that is not the case. They have unique personalities and side characters in most anime are lucky to have the flair they do. Shuu, the first of the three heroes I will go into, is absolutely wonderful. He&#039;s slightly perverted, a fast talker, and really likes to tease the girls in his area of the story. He&#039;s basically what would happen if you took that perverted best friend seen in all harem anime and made them the protagonist. The second of our heroes is Hayato, who to put it plainly is rude. He seems like he doesn&#039;t care about the people in his side of the story, and speaks in a very deep, mumbling voice. Together, both of these protagonists are very unique and stand out the the sea of harem protagonists who look and act the same. And then there&#039;s Takashi, who&#039;s, well, the dullest of the bunch and has no personality besides being nice and a wimp, and he&#039;s supposed to be the mainest one, which is ironic given the fact he gets the least screen time of the three, but hey. I&#039;ll much rather see Hayato and Shuu.<br />
<br />
In another irony, most of the times in harem anime you don&#039;t care about the main character and only care about the girls, but here it is the exact opposite. Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai has perhaps the worst cast of girls in any harem anime. It&#039;s not like they&#039;re bad or annoying, it&#039;s just that they have no personality at all. Sure one&#039;s a little more moe, and the other two are a little more tsundere, but besides that they have little personality. They also add very little to the story also. You could remove two of them and nothing would&#039;ve really changed. There&#039;s also a huge cast of side characters of which are completely useless in every way and serve no purpose besides comic relief.<br />
<br />
And well, that&#039;s really what Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai is pulled down by, its uselessness. Only about one-fourht of this show serves a purpose. The other three-fourths is typically weird comic relief. And by weird comic relief, I mena weird. It was funny, but not in a “ha ha, that&#039;s hilarious” way, but in a “that&#039;s so stupid” way. One scene of this anime manages to make rubbing cream on a wound look sexual. You do not want to know. <br />
<br />
Due to the filler in the plot, that makes the actual story even more confusing than it actually is. It takes until literally the last minute of episode 4 for the major plot twist the drives the story to happen and it takes  like, nine for the show to really kick off and actually begin getting somewhere. Due to this, the ending is very rushed and doesn&#039;t make much sense at all. It has ambition, but not the right build-up to make an effort. <br />
<br />
And that&#039;s my main problem with this show, the fact it has no darn clue what it&#039;s supposed to be doing. I mean, there&#039;s not enough romance in it to be a romance. None of the characters get together with anyone. Only one of the three main characters even dates anyone. There&#039;s not enough drama for it to be a drama. All drama is filtered out by comedic moment. I mean, this show goes into a pretty heavy subject, but it never feels dark at all. Thus it cannot be a psychological anime, as it does not go into the characters enough to become one. Ideally then, it should be a lame harem comedy, but it tries too hard to become one of those. Shuu and Hayato do a flawless job pulling the show along, and the direction is decent also. It&#039;s just too light-hearted for what it wants to be. <br />
<br />
The art is, well, lame. Character designs look generic, and two of the characters look exactly the same almost. The animation isn&#039;t very fluid. The music is a little better. It&#039;s still very average, but the opening is very decent for what it is. I don&#039;t remember what the ending was, so don&#039;t ask on that. The background music has a few nice soundtracks in it. The voice actors tend to vary. Shuu and Hayato have great voice actors to match their great characters, while the girls have lame and generic voice actors to fit their lame and generic characters. <br />
<br />
Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai is very bad, but in a way it&#039;s kind of fun. If it sounds like your type of show, then by all means watch it. But if it doesn&#039;t then don&#039;t watch it. I give this anime 6 stars.

    No matter how much you may want to escape, you cannot fly without wings. Even if you try to deny who you are, you can&#039;t change exactly who you are. That being said, this anime came to me as a surprise. I first discovered it from an English-dubbed trailer released by Funimation, and because of it, I expected it to be a nonsensical ecchi. I came for the ecchi and ended up staying for the amazing story that blew my initial expectations right out of the window.<br />
<br />
Adapted from the visual novel created by Navel (the company that created Shuffle and Soul Link, two eroge that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195642">
        also got anime adaptations), We Without Wings, known in Japanese as Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai: Under The Innocent Sky (or Oretsuba), is the anime which I will be reviewing today.<br />
<br />
We Without Wings centers around three young men. The first one is Takashi Haneda, a high school student who is known in another world (which he frequently &quot;escapes&quot; to) as a hero named Lord Hawk. The second is Shuusuke  Chitose, a freeloader who works several part-time jobs. The third is Hayato Narita, a man who only hangs around at night and is nicknamed &quot;Drac&quot; as a result. The anime focuses on the relationships between these three boys and the girls they respectively encounter..... and we find out later that they have a lot more in common than you would think.<br />
<br />
The story is probably the best part of the whole anime. I&#039;ll admit that the first few episodes don&#039;t make the best impression, but once you really get into the story, it really grips you and refuses to let go. Without trying to spoil anything, I&#039;ll just say that it&#039;s a wonderful story with a good amount of character development. Speaking of which, there is quite a variety of characters in this anime. While not all of them are completely likable, there are a lot of great characters that really make you feel like you want to know what happens to them.<br />
<br />
The animation, done by Nomad, was very solid. Although it wasn&#039;t anything too groundbreaking, it was very nice animation. I watched the English dub, and I can say that the voice actors did a pretty good job. What do you expect, though? After all, it WAS Funimation that dubbed it! The opening and ending themes, which respectively are &quot;Spread Wings&quot; by Aki Misato and &quot;NEVERLAND&quot; by Miyuki Hashimoto, were also quite nice to listen to.<br />
<br />
Overall, We Without Wings is a pretty good anime. If you can have some patience for the first few episodes, I suggest you watch it for the great story it has. I can only hope this way that the world may know peace!

    I don&#039;t understand how people can give this greater than a rating of 5.<br />
<br />
Okay. I have watched hundreds of school life romance and visual novel or eroge game based anime, and this one is HORRIBLY BAD.<br />
<br />
Not only does it produce more fanservice than is needed, it totally, totally does not provide anywhere near enough explanation for practically everything in the show. I want to understand it without playing the game, please.<br />
<br />
My view may be biased, mainly because Shuffle, which came from the same company, is my all time favorite anime, and Oretachi had me EXTREMELY hyped when i found out about it on my birthday,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review57301">
        when the first episode aired. It was such a letdown in so many ways, lacking drama, sense, or anything the Navel game must FOR SURE have in it, that I just can&#039;t ever give it any sort of decent rating. There is even a random scene where they just start banging, out of nowhere, in the anime. Okay, if i wanted to see that, I would play the game. Why would you do this?!? Despite the potential to have very compelling characters and a great story, due to the short 13 episode set not much was able to be put together efficiently. This anime is bad. Playing the game would 100% be a better choice. Completely forgettable story, decent characters, too much fanservice, and a muddled delivery. Perhaps it would have been much better in a 24 episode set like Shuffle, so they can convey the storyline more gradually rather than all at once.<br />
<br />
The good parts are so obscenely outweighed by the horrible parts that they just seem to linger in the background, while the badness comes at you full force. Navel, if you plan on making any more anime, can you make something that isn&#039;t a huge mess condensed into 13 episodes?!? Don&#039;t make your complicated eroge storylines into an anime unless its 24 eps and has time to devote to every heroine. Even Shuffle felt like it could use a bit more expansion on certain characters, and it already had 24 episodes to use.<br />
<br />
Anyways I apologize if you liked this anime. I may be biased as I said, and I had come to expect more from the people who made the awesome Shuffle and less-appreciated-but-still-darn-good Soul Link.

    If you want to watch an ecchi anime . . . this isnt for you. The ecchi scenes are few and far between and just jump out of no where. The ecchi fanatic will be starved, had some meat dangled in front of him, and then have it repeat. <br />
<br />
If you want to watch a drama . . . . this isnt for you. It is not hard to make me cry in an anime. I cried during Angel Beats, Clannad, One piece (When Robbin says she doesnt want to die . . . . i watched it 5 times and made me cry every

          <span style="display: none;" id="review117749">
        time) but not once did this anime touch my heart or make me feel attached to the characters with the exception of Asuka who really should&#039;ve been in the story more.<br />
<br />
Another thing this anime does wrong is it is too confusing for too long. I understand having some mystery in your show but when you don&#039;t know what in the world is going on until episode 8 of 12 . . . that is a bit much. without giving anything away, it will jump from and to different stories completely randomly and you will have absolutely no idea what they have to do with eachother, why certain things are happening, and what the point of anything is until 3/4 of the way through.<br />
<br />
<br />
WARNINGS BEFORE YOU WATCH THIS<br />
Episode 1 is the first nail in the confusion coffin. If you want to cut down on the confusion a bit, skip the first 3 minutes of episode 1. They have nothing to do with anything that is about to happen.<br />
The art is good except for 2 guys and 2 girls that look WAAAAAY too similar.This adds to the confusion. 2 of the girls have the same hairstyle except one has a bow and the other doesnt. And also 2 of the guys have the same hair color and similar hairstyle. Just a bit of warning when going in . .  . the guy at the restaurant and the guy in the city are NOT the same person. That had me confused for a while.<br />
There is one very over the top ecchi scene in episode 8. Like . . . incredibly out of place and way more intense than anything before or after it in terms of ecchi. Mute your computer for that part.<br />
<br />
This wont be your favorite anime but if anything, it will teach you what works and what doesnt in an anime. The only scenes i actually enjoyed were the ones with Asuka. She kept me watching but there just simply is not enough of her. Anyway, overall, i give this a 5/10. It is probably the worst anime ive ever seen (other than girls bravo. The only show i have ever dropped). But that isnt saying much since most i have watched were amazing. it has good points, but it has way more bad.

    I&#039;ve never been much for reviews, but when I recomend this anime to others, I also need to mention one concideration. This anime starts off very confusing, and I didn&#039;t truelly start to enjoy it until the 4th episode when the bits and pieces finally fit together. Once I got past the initial rough patch, it became more interesting beyond the ero jokes that it overflows with. As much as I enjoy ero humour in all its simplicity, this story added a much more unexpected flavour which had me laughing and gripping my seat at times.

    If you are looking for something completely different, thought provoking, and brilliant, please please please give this show a chance!<br />
<br />
This show has a horrible start, due to it over pushing fanservice, flipping through so many new faces you can&#039;t keep your head straight and having a little girl say horribly adult things. Which is it&#039;s main downfall, as well as some moments coming off cheesey, and a lot of what goes on just does not make sense. <br />
<br />
See the thing is, it&#039;s not supposed to. In hindsight, everything was well done, made sense and worked. But if you don&#039;t finish the show, you will not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review72615">
        feel this way. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s crazy to say, but I&#039;ve never watched an anime like this, and I highly doubt I ever will again. It really makes you think and is not for someone just wanting a fluffy light harem comedy. As much as this appears to be one, that is not at all what it ends up being. Yes, you have to be comfortable with fanservice (see my list filled with ecchi) &amp; good with keeping plot lines straight in your head. This show is to be focused on, or the main plot (which is hard to grab hold of) will fly right over your head. <br />
<br />
I finished the last episode feeling extremely satisfied, the last three or four episodes completely making up for the first bit of insane jumbled madness. I have no regrets watching it. <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t recommend this to everyone. It&#039;s a niche within a niche. It&#039;s Durarara meets To LoveRU meets Elfin Lied meets Pani Poni Dash. <br />
<br />
In short, if you can get through it, get through it and you will be so glad you did.

    So a review... this will be my first review so bear with me on this one. This review is from the episodes 1-7. First of all when I was watching the 1st episode, it felt like the anime was going to be a bit dull besides the ecchi parts hehehe. But when I continued watching further episodes, I thought it would just be about the life of several characters or something like that, but still continuing to watch further episodes, It suddenly became more intriguing with that plot twist(not telling.just watch it). <br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
Rated the story 8 because the story is unique and can be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37183">
        very intriguing. First it felt it would be like those &quot;Slice of Life&quot; animes but when you continue watching, it gets more interesting but sometimes it would be ecchi, random and funny so I guess this anime wouldn&#039;t be so boring to watch. With the story getting more interesting, I just don&#039;t know what will happen next, because like I told you, sometimes it gets random. Most of the Episode&#039;s ending can make you want to know what happens next n thus also making it more interesting.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
The Art of this anime is Great, I mean the characters, the clothes, the hair are very well made. Also, the environment is great too, lots of places were shown but all of them are greatly done and also with the background. The art is just great.. they have very nice shading, coloring etc, all perfect for each scene.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
Sounds of the anime are very good. The voices of each character fits them perfectly, voices of the Cute characters, Cool characters, Serious characters, Innocent chracters, etc etc etc. The sound effects are also very good, even with the prop sounds(e.g. the bongos, the radio thing, etc). The music too, this anime has good background music that goes well with the scenes, for the OP and ED song... I dunno what the lyrics mean yet but it feels like it goes well with the anime.<br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
I love how each character is made, each and every character just have their different and unique personality, attitude, characteristics, style, likes, hates, etc. There are those Cool characters, Crazy characters, Cute characters, Innocent characters, Kind characters, Stupid-looking characters, 1 LOLI character(well.. there might be others), etc. There might be a character here you might love since there are lots of different kinds in the anime. All of them just have their style, their hair, their clothes, eyes, voices, etc, all of it fits them very well(well thats what i think). All very well made characters, I just love how different and unique each character is.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
Besides the ecchi scenes, i enjoyed  most of the episodes. The anime could get Random, Funny, Serious, Shocking, Confusing, It just keeps getting interesting each passing episode. But i never knew i would enjoy this anime though since the first episode was kinda dull and that&#039;s why they put lots of ecchi scenes in the first few episodes. But... is the ecchi scenes getting lesser and lesser? eh.. I love intriguing stories anyways. So anyways, you might enjoy this anime because of the ecchi scenes, the characters, or the story.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
I&#039;m not really sure if I should rate the overall a 9 since I reviewed the anime from the episodes 1-7 so i dunno if the upcoming episodes will surprise me or just disappoint me. It should have been 8 though but since the score is 8,9,8,9,9. Anyways this anime very good so far but with this kind of story, I&#039;m not even sure how the anime will end AND isn&#039;t 12 episodes too short? I mean with this story it should have like maybe 20 or more episodes. Hmph... can&#039;t do anything about it. Soooo yeah... you might like the characters of the anime or the story or maybe you just want to see some ecchi scenes so just try to watch the anime, you might love it, like it or hate it. Eh..everyone has their taste of anime. I started liking the anime though.<br />
<br />
Since I made this review after watching episode 7, all i want to say about it is that... they sure had lots of cake!!!! Where..! let me say it again.. WHERE In the heck did they get all those cakes??? And worst part is.. they just wasted all of it TT^TT but since it was like WAR or like a Cake War then it&#039;s fine since i love war. Wanted to throw a cake or two hehe :D

    I stumbled across this anime accedently. I read the reviews of how good it was. I watched two episodes and immediately I wanted to find the people who gave this anime an 7 or higher and fucking kill them....... I apologize! If you stick with it, its actually a good story. Overlooking the little girl who served no purpose but she was different and funny so i guess its passable. The only thing I don&#039;t like you only start to understand what&#039;s going around episode 5 or 6, so I feel they could&#039;ve added more episodes letting us see all the personalites together as a

    Well after watching the first episode, you will feel something along this line: &quot;Huh?&quot; But don&#039;t give up yet! So you try the second episode and you&#039;re probably &quot;ok...&quot; And it just seem like this anime is just about 3 guys who goes around and gets tons of girls, just the typical generic harem, and also a lot of fanservice. But as you keep on watching you find that there is  more to it.<br />
<br />
Story: Yes it looks like the generic harem except now it is about 3 guys surrounded by a bunch of cute girls. Also there are also bunch of funny moments and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review46989">
        yes the point of view keeps switching around and it just become quite confusing. The point of view keeps changing between the 3 main characters and it feels like what the hell is going on? Well this is a harem and fanservice filled anime, but I will throw in the word psychological too. Now while watching try to remember this little spoiler hint word: psychological.<br />
<br />
Art: Well since it is another harem/ecchi anime, the girls are all cute, beautiful, and those falls where you&#039;re just blast PANTYSHOTS PANTYSHOTS PANTYSHOTS! The fanservice is in every episode so don&#039;t be so surprised by it. But I have to admit that the characters are all well drawn and they look fabulous. <br />
<br />
Sound: The soundtrack is great. I love it, the OP starting with &quot;spread wings&quot; and other endings like &quot;Paranoia&quot; and &quot;neverland&quot; all of the songs are quite great and fun to listen to. I really loved all of the OP and ED songs so yeah the soundtrack was great. Also the voices are really helpful as they don&#039;t all sound alike.<br />
<br />
Character: Well...there is somewhat a character development surrounding all three male protagonist and their respective heroines. But overall there is not much character development. There is a large cast though, but those supporting characters are just here to spice things up, but not for plot or character development as much.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Well,I wasn&#039;t satisfied with this anime nor was I disappointed with it. So I guess I would feel something like in between. It is a pretty cute story overall though. BUT it may take awhile before you can actually get the big picture. This anime is really like a jigsaw puzzle, or a riddle. You have to watch a lot of it before you actually go AH! I know what is the answer. Well most of the early episodes will seem random and confusing but that ah moment will come soon. Also it is filled with a lot of funny moments of course so it is pretty fun to  watch as new surprises is practically around every corner of this anime series. If you&#039;re not patient enough with this anime, and not to determine to watch it through I would say that it would seem pretty dull because of the first few episodes, but I am telling to just endure it for awhile and watch it through and you&#039;ll feel pretty happy that you watched the whole series. Well hope you enjoy!
