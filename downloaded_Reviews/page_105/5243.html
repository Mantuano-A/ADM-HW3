    It’s supposed to be a mere guidebook, yet I found myself enjoying this piece of the story with a whole new set of emotions.<br />
<br />
The series itself is all about learning while spicing it up with a short and calming love story. It tries to show how little by little people try to reach the stairs of adulthood, even in their thirties. It’s certainly fun to explore the very basic knowledge about sex relationships from a different perspective. Nowadays, no one technically cares except for having fun and spurts. Totally like a cat in the heats. However, this series does much more than that and we

          <span style="display: none;" id="review268999">
        truly need to appreciate this one piece. The series slowly teaches us a few things at first, before it starts to proceed through a deeper plot, such as how to deal with a real relationship. While some of their jokes tend to be cringe at times, we still see such a lovely yet warm story in the show.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
It mainly begins with Hayao Imagawa, who has yet to lose his virginity even though he has already reached thirty. Due to his busy life and anxious attitude when being around women, he can only make it past awkward at best. Worse, he started to use a sex doll as much as he could instead of finding a real girlfriend or wife. Thus, a God of Sexual Love named Daigorou has been sent from heaven to help him lose his virginity. Better watch yourselves. These are not ordinary gods.<br />
<br />
The story pace might be slow, but it’s still relaxing and keeps the progress meter running till the very end. Sometimes it gets hectic and chaotic, but it never fails to deliver the right things. In this world, when it comes to romance, there is always someone who is faster, while others may be a bit slower, because we perceive almost everything very differently, even in the same sense. To boot, our emotions are not the same either; to actually connect both people would require much more than a simple spurt of nuts. But in the end, it was still an enjoyable moment to see those lights shine away in this series. As the show manages to mix all kinds of emotions, everything has been fused together into a beautiful one-piece that is worthy of praise.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation<br />
The art and animation of the show are very cute. It is far from some flashy, cheap animation. The art is still nicely done, in a proper way, and the animation is in its own league. The OP is truly interesting; I kinda love how pure it is.<br />
<br />
Personally speaking, I love every single character in this series. They are not perfect but still play their roles efficiently without any blemishes or flaws. In a sense, we can even relate to their personalities as well. It has become so much fun to see the interaction between our pair of lovebirds. How cute.<br />
<br />
30-sai is a show that almost everyone can enjoy and relax while watching. It is not packed with action and blood, but it is still magnificently fun to watch. The jokes, knowledge, and everything else have been put down in one piece that’s more than worth seeing.

    This is my review on 30-sai no Hoken Taiiku - A Thirty-Year Old&#039;s Health and Physical Education. The subject/theme of this anime is sex but it has a lot of comedy in it that makes learning about sex, fun to watch through this anime.<br />
<br />
Story (5-7/10): Personally, I give it 6<br />
The story is pretty straight forward and simple to understand. a 30-year old man named Hayao Imagawa have been a virgin his entire life and thus have never had sex. Because of his circumstances a God of Sexual Love sent from heaven approaches him where he must help him find the right woman he can lose

          <span style="display: none;" id="review252923">
        his virginity to, in order to complete his assignment and return to heaven. Imagawa meets up with different women because of Daigorou, a God of Sex that pretty much interferes with his life (at least according to the main character) until he falls in love with someone aged 30 like himself and a virgin too. And now here begins his journey of true love (sex).<br />
The story is just a normal romance love story that focuses on education to succeed in that topic, whereas the gods is there to bring comedy and guide them by being <br />
<br />
Art (6-7/10): Personally, I give it 7<br />
I think the animation is fitting for this anime not too flashy but not so bad to ruin the watching experience. I love the different backgrounds that’s been used when characters interact with one another or is having a monolog. The simple environment that’s been used on different parts in the city may be giving a boring feel to it to some that watches this anime but I think it fits well with the adult genre and let’s not forget that this is an adult educational anime so it must have these kinds of elements or it might lose its edge. I think it’s a good way been portraying when the god teaches for example the main character what he should be focusing on how to treat a woman, it gives you the educational feel.<br />
The thing I don’t like much is that the characters often stay constant but I guess it’s to save budget. I also enjoyed noticing some of it’s use of anime references like Jojo or Dragon Ball Z.<br />
Important note when watching this anime, you should watch it uncensored, the first time I watched it when it aired, it was rather confusing to watch when many pictures and scenes was censored and certain words which made me confused as a result. So, watching it uncensored is the best way to watch it.<br />
<br />
Sound (7-8/10): Personally, I give it 8<br />
The OP &amp; ED that’s been used in the anime is very good and can be listened to more than once but it’s not that memorable but fitting for this anime, I personally loved both and I think the Ending credits was really clever showing the main characters appearances from their early childhood to later in their adulthood for each episode where in the end of the song shows how the main characters relationship stands atm. <br />
The OST that’s been used through the anime is very much unique and there are some tracks I really loved listening to which made the anime better to watch. For example, after the scene where Daigorou &quot;God of Sex&quot; approached the Main character naked and got kicked out, returned inside sitting in a throne on his dining table and thus the track plays, I think it’s really good. The background music that’s been played through the anime has been used well in various scenes.<br />
<br />
Character (9-10/10): Personally, I give it 10<br />
Although the anime story was average and pretty dull, what made this anime good was its characters and the character development for each character, in my opinion. The main characters that tried finding their soulmates and the gods constantly trying to help but most of the time interfered and made the moments more hilarious than should be. Extremely short summaries with my opinion on why I think they are so made well in the development of the story:<br />
<br />
1. Hayao Imagawa: The male main character that is supposed to be the guy that comments while being bashed by the gods, and gets treated badly by the gods, becomes more confident in his abilities and starts taking more chances than in the past where he most of the time failed. I didn’t like his character that much but I enjoyed his growth as a character.<br />
2. Natsu Andou: The female main character, she originally was shy of guys but learns to become a more independent woman. She is what I expected as a female MC and satisfied with her growth.<br />
3. Daigorou: He is my favorite character, he is supposed to be the god of sex who is silver haired, good dressing, handsome and not shy of being nude. His treatment of the male MC made me laugh a lot of times.<br />
4. Macaron: The second god of sex and the little brother to Daigorou, who has to help him getting Imagawa to lose his virginity. He often dresses as a girl, and looks really cute but… He is  a guy!<br />
5. Pii-chan: Is one of the female gods of sex that has to help Andou the female main character losing her virginity for similar situation. What I really love about Pii-chan is that she reminds me of Perona from One Piece, her many priceless face expressions makes me laugh hard every time, you can’t hate her.<br />
6. Kuu-chan: Pii-chan’s twin sister is another god of sex who has forgot speaking Japanese so she keeps saying and doing random stuff which is fun to watch.<br />
<br />
I really enjoy the presence of each character, it makes this simple love story more fun to watch. The ending is worth the completion if you are in doubt of wanting to continue watching this anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (7-8/10): Personally, I give it 8<br />
I really enjoyed this anime a lot and though the story was average which I have seen before the characters made it worth to watch. The animation and the art being used, I enjoyed noticing it a great deal and I loved the music and songs that’s been used for this anime. The characters development made it more enjoyable and the gods presence made it more comedically, <br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
But in all honesty, some that watches this anime might think it’s disturbing or messed up what the gods do and portray like Daigorou dressing up his 8-year old little brother and giving green light to Imagawa to practice sex with, that’s cringed lol.<br />
<br />
PS:<br />
This review is based on my rating on enjoyment and other specific factors. The first time I watched it I enjoyed it greatly, considering the strange title it has. Later, I rewatched this anime again so I could focus on other factors than the story.<br />
This is my second Review and my first anime TV series Review, because I’m inexperienced I must learn to reduce the length of my reviews. Again, I had a lot of fun writing this review, and I’m open for all kinds of feedback.<br />
<br />
Overall Rating 8 - Very Good ^_^<br />
<br />

    30-sai no Hoken Taiiku (Health education for 30 year olds) is a one sick show. There are so many wrong things in this anime that I don&#039;t even know where to start. This series focuses on the most widely talked about subject in human history - that being sex. <br />
<br />
Okey fine, but the way they present it is just completely over the top. Like the image of 5 soldiers rubbing up and down againts an artillery piece which then fires a white canonball at a humonguous tissue. I&#039;m never going to be able to look at artillery seriously ever again. That horrifying image is now

          <span style="display: none;" id="review42889">
        burned in my head for good. <br />
<br />
The story is as unbelievably crazy as it can only get. We have a 30 year old virgin dude (that&#039;s not the unbelievable part though) who has no luck with the ladies (that&#039;s also NOT unbelievable but read on). One day a silver haired god of sex comes down with the offer of helping him lose his virginity. Along with him comes his little sexually confused brother. As it turns out the gods will not leave until he loses his virginity. <br />
<br />
That&#039;s when total craziness starts. At first the main character is lectured by the gods, what he should do and what he shouldn&#039;t do when around women. Okey, fair enough but then it just gets downright weird... the small god (probably 8 years old) offers himself for practice (WTF). Soon after the second god also offered his... urr backside to the main character. When the main character rejected the offers, the god&#039;s ass[hole] started sucking in everything in the room.  At that point I stopped the video, ran to my bathroom and poured all the bleach I could find on my eyes. I then tried to erase that image from my eyes with a nail file. Upon failure, I realised that the only solution would be to set myself on fire... and that attempt also failed. <br />
<br />
The series gets even more ridicilous from then on, we have a 100 something year old Virgin King who looks like Nappa from DBZ, a horny Japanese goddess who can only speak French and another 30 year old virgin (this time it&#039;s a woman) who&#039;s also looking forward to lose her virginity with the help of two goddesses. <br />
<br />
In other words... I&#039;m at a loss for words. Yes, this show is fucked up.<br />
<br />
Apart from the corny story... art is pretty good, sound is nothing special really just your run-of-the-mill anime music.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment... hmm, it depends. If you&#039;re the kind of person that enjoys watching gods lavishly show off their naked bottoms and see small boys offer themselfes to 30 year olds then this series is probably for you. However when you&#039;re looking for a more meaningful comedy then by all means stay away from this anime.  <br />
<br />
I have no idea why I&#039;ve even watched it in the first place.

    Health Lessons for 30 year olds is an odd show. Well, of course it is - it&#039;s suppose to be education and enjoyable. So I might be slightly insane for watching it in the eyes of others, but it was slightly surprising… It was funny?<br />
<br />
Yes, knowing that nobody would watch an educational program like this, they decided to make this a comedy. Introducing a tip on romance the characters usually ignore it as the sex gods, who have come to ensure the virgins succeed, squabble amongst themselves how they will never finish their job. A combination of tsukkomi, parodies, and a lot of randomness I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review39679">
        never felt compelled to drop 30-sai.<br />
<br />
As a comedy the story is rather insignificant - it revolves around two virgins and their sex gods who are trying to find them a soul mate. The tips are always incorporated into a joke so you remember them. By the end it didn&#039;t really serve its purpose as I only remember one of them: &quot;Keep eye contact for 10 seconds at a time.&quot; <br />
<br />
The characters aren&#039;t bad. The god&#039;s definitely have personality which is the only way this show is watchable. The couple are okay, of course you might not empathize with 30 year old virgins depending on how nice of a person you are. The girl is slightly androphobic or tsundere, and the male is what is easily classifiable as a typical male lead. In fact the synopsis is right, the love is rather pure as there is really low amount of fan service. They just don&#039;t show much that needs to be censored. They do have a lot of language censored, but the voiceover, I am convinced is Wakamoto Norio, can be humorous. Personally I never paid enough attention to make it out, but others on the forums were enjoying them.<br />
<br />
30-sai was an okay watch. I picked it up on a whim, but it is neither very educational nor very funny. I am not sure if I would recommend it, actually I wouldn&#039;t since there are a lot of things out there to watch, but it wouldn&#039;t burn your eyes out if you did either.<br />

There is something that humans crave more than anything. No, it&#039;s not food, it&#039;s not peace of mind, and it&#039;s not even anime. What everyone wants the most is sex. Whether for pleasure or for procreation, sex is an integral part to society as we know it. &quot;Sex sells,&quot; as the saying goes. It&#039;s filled with a flurry of emotions: love, happiness, embarrassment, anguish. Many good and bad things arise from not only sex but even from just being in a sexual relationship. But before any of that, how does one get to that point? This is what

          <span style="display: none;" id="review172721">
        30-sai no Hoken Taiiku aims to explore, and what it contains is a cute little story enshrouded in education.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
&quot;Health and Physical Education for 30 Year-Olds,&quot; as it is known in English, begins with Imagawa, a newly turned 30 year old virgin. When the clock strikes twelve, a god of sex known as Daigorou descends from heaven. His task is simple: to rid Imagawa of his longstanding virginity.<br />
<br />
Sounds wacky, right? You wouldn&#039;t be wrong to think otherwise. But this is something that 30-sai no Hoken Taiiku does right. It tackles a subject that isn&#039;t normally (if at all) looked upon, at least within the realm of anime. Focusing on dating and sex, the show explores many facets related to such topics. Nothing is off limits; discussions about the pros of the &quot;cowgirl&quot; position or the optimal eye-contact length are the norm. The show is a parody, so to an extent, the majority of the &quot;lessons&quot; are so basic or simple that it&#039;s a wonder that Imagawa and Andou have never learned about them before, let alone experienced them. Yet, its educational format adds to the uniqueness that the show permeates.<br />
<br />
Beneath the layer of French kissing techniques and dealing with double rejection lives a more subtle tale. The main quest is to rid Imagawa and Andou of their virginity, sure, but that&#039;s the short of it. The overall purpose the anime was going for was demonstrating that, despite these two people&#039;s &quot;situations,&quot; they, too, were able to find love. What&#039;s interesting are not the literal gods who help them or the silly antics. Rather, it&#039;s the portrayal of such a couple. While both happen to be 30 years old, their development is more akin to sheltered teenagers than full grown adults. In this way, the anime isn&#039;t looking to appeal to men and women experienced in the art of Kama Sutra. Instead, its focus is on the fan-base attributed to anime. It&#039;s an interesting idea that plays off of the stigma associated with people who partake in the medium. That is, the &quot;situation&quot; fans of anime are placed in does not automatically rule out sex or love for them. It might make it harder to obtain, like being a 30 year old virgin, but that doesn&#039;t mean it is not within reach.<br />
<br />
Finally, the ending. Strangely, it is massively anti-climactic in what is depicted. But it is done this way for a particular reason: to showcase how meaningless losing one&#039;s virginity really is. It&#039;s not deserving of some elaborate celebration, because it&#039;s not the loss that is important. On the contrary, it&#039;s what comes after that matters most. A deeper connection with the one you love, deciding to start a family; these are the aspects that carry the most weight. The ending handles this gracefully, and ends the cute little story on a rather touching moment.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
<br />
30-sai no Hoken Taiiku doesn&#039;t animate as if it were 30 years old, but it might as well have.<br />
<br />
This one follows a rather simple mindset. Simple looking environments and simple character designs; it&#039;s honestly just boring to look at. The only moments when the show was worthwhile to view were when it adopted the &quot;chibi&quot; style drawings. Here, the characters take on solid eyes, squat designs, and choppy movements.<br />
<br />
As for the actual animation, despite being constrained to about 13 minutes an episode, it is either non-existent or poorly done. Obviously it&#039;s a &quot;realistic&quot; story, so there isn&#039;t much flair or innovation that needs to go on. But there isn&#039;t much movement to be had at any point as the show progressed.<br />
<br />
An important note: this show must be watched uncensored. The censored version has an abysmal amount of covered-up scenes, blurred out actions, and bleeped words. It&#039;s possible to watch it this way, but one is sorely missing out otherwise.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
As the title of the anime suggests, this show delves into the lives of two people, Hayao Imagawa and Natsu Andou. Both are 30 years old, both are virgins, and both are aiming to take that &quot;next big step.&quot;<br />
<br />
Imagawa takes a lead role in this mature comedy. Awkward, nervous, and quite normal, his love for Andou is genuine and real. While he may wish to have sex someday, he much prefers to enjoy the time he spends with his lover outside of the bedroom. His characterization makes him more of a &quot;Gary-Stu&quot; than one is initially led to believe. We&#039;re not meant to be sympathetic towards him so much as we are supposed to be empathetic. Imagawa acts as any regular, socially inept guy would. Fumbling his words, not catching hints, and at times trying a bit too hard, he&#039;s like any other dude experiencing love for the very first time.<br />
<br />
Andou is Imagawa&#039;s equivalent. Her shyness is adorable and her embarrassment regarding anything sexual is sweet to see. She exudes innocence, and is not afraid to put up walls (figurative and literal!) if she has to. Imagawa suffers the difficulties attached to his predicament, and Andou is no different. Her gender may be the complete opposite, but her tribulations are nothing of the sort. Andou, similar to her lover, is a &quot;Mary-Sue.&quot; But her inclusion serves a higher purpose. Society often views a man&#039;s virginity as a burden whereas a woman&#039;s is precious. Here, though, we see Andou actively seeking to lose something supposedly dear to her. In other words, someone&#039;s virginity, man or woman, may in fact be precious. But outside influence shouldn&#039;t dictate one&#039;s assumptions; only that person has the right to make such choices.<br />
<br />
While the main cast are deeper than they appear on the outside, sadly, the same cannot be said for the side cast. Most, if not all, of them are very weak. This is mainly due to their roles. Acting as teachers of sort, their only purpose is to relay information about sexual intercourse, relationship tips, or comedic relief. There may be an argument for religious implications (how religion often views virginity as sacred, but here the gods are constantly pushing the two to make love), but this is stretching the short story just a bit. At the least, their inclusion can be looked at as a metaphor for destiny. Sometimes, events happen so naturally that it almost seems like fate itself were guiding everything along.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
The OP is not very good. It&#039;s simple beat and vocals make it entirely boring to listen to, and the song itself is a little too uppity.<br />
<br />
The ED, likewise, is still a bit boring. The drums do add a bit of flair that seemed to be lacking in the OP, but it&#039;s a simple rhythm and song that is not memorable enough to be listened to outside of the show itself.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is quite forgettable. It&#039;s mainly an assortment of guitar tracks and piano pieces used for &quot;everyday&quot; music.<br />
<br />
In regards to the voice acting, no outstanding performances were to be had.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
This anime treads a rather fine line. On the one hand, for those old enough, the information given is already common. On the other hand, those too young under appreciate it as just a few hints at how sex should be handled. Not that either side can&#039;t appreciate what the anime was really trying to go for, but one has to ignore the blatant, in-your-face sexual positions, references, and methodologies in order to understand the parody for what it is.<br />
<br />
The comedy involved is really bad. Cringe inducing even. It tries desperately hard to be comical when it can, and it almost always falls flat in this regard. Instead, the show shines best when it is showcasing the cute couple failing to interact with one another because of their quite evident lack of experience. Andou&#039;s blushing when talking about spending time with Imagawa or Imagawa respecting Andou not for her body but for who she is as a person are romantic moments, and easily put a smile on my face each and every time.<br />
<br />
In a medium mostly dominated by a younger audience, 30-sai no Hoken Taiiku attempted to try something a bit more mature. While the topic itself is &quot;touchy,&quot; the ideas it tries to present in parody fashion are not entirely lost. If anything, this one should at least be credited with thinking outside the box.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Good, sex, parody, and a message<br />
<br />
Animation: Bad, boring, plain, stale, and needs to be watched uncensored<br />
<br />
Characters: Fine, main cast are nice but the rest are weak<br />
<br />
Sound: Terrible, OP and ED are a no-go, bad soundtrack, okay VA work<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Fine, lame comedy yet a good romance<br />
<br />
Final Score: 4/10

    This is only after the first episode so I&#039;m giving scores based on my expectations based on only 10 minutes of content but assuming it fulfills it&#039;s potential as a series the scores should be pretty accurate.<br />
<br />
When I first read that it was adapted from a guide book I was expecting something with little to no plot and focusing on an educational aspect. However while it isn&#039;t developing plot like you usual story it does seem to be building a interesting story and setting.<br />
This anime definitely focuses on comedy, having completely irrational situations with a normal rational main character.<br />
<br />
One thing that annoyed me was the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35824">
        censoring, all words involving sex or anything about that were dubbed over with strange comments making it kind of hard to follow the conversation (text was censored as well).<br />
<br />
Art was good, it wasn&#039;t ultra pretty or anything but it matched the mood well and didn&#039;t take away any enjoyment from the anime. Censors didn&#039;t remove any enjoyment from the anime.<br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with any voice acting, nothing too special but all around good sound. Though there is the problem with the censoring but again not a big deal.<br />
<br />
Characters had depth, actions seemed reasonable for their positions and personalities.<br />
<br />
The comedy aspect of the anime made it quite enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Overall very good, worth watching so far, looking forward to more episodes and hoping they bring out the story&#039;s potential.

    OK, so Japan&#039;s population is in decline, in fact 2/3 of it&#039;s residence are in their 60&#039;s and up, well, come to think of it, Japan&#039;s &quot;Cost Of Living&quot; is pretty much high and that is expected from any developed nations, if my history serves me right, Japan before WW2 was overpopulated, but enough of that. My questions is, are Japanese hombres (men) and Chiquitas ( cute women) that hopelessly romantic? I don&#039;t get it,are there hombres and Chiquitas (cute women) whom are in their 30&#039;s (or worse 40&#039;s) who were yet to have their cherries pop? Que Horror (that&#039;s horrible)! Pardon me, amigos for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36720">
        such BS, but this anime is what it is, according to MAL&#039;s info, but as I view this anime, I&#039;m really find it appalling that somehow that this 12 min anime is suggesting that Japanese were hopelessly romantic (well, not all for sure). But really, this anime is sooo poor that is should have not been made into one and instead it should remain as a pamphlet and distributed in the 4 corners of Japan, Geezz, Ok so how do I rate this anime? Here&#039;s how:<br />
<br />
Story- Poor 3.<br />
<br />
The story is what it is according to MAL&#039;s info (I&#039;ve mentioned that already), which a certain hopeless romantic  Hayao Imagawa is the main epitome, he has  poco loco (little crazy) deity, Daigorou, who calls himself a &quot;God of Sex&quot; there is also the deity&#039;s kid brother  Macaron,who is as crazy as the deity itself. Both are helping him score a certain chiquita (cute woman) who happens to be Andou Natsu another hopeless romantic who seems to be too scared of having a romantic relationship. With her is the &quot;Goddess of Sex&quot;  Pii-Chan and the Goddess&#039;s french speaking and Tabasco sauce drinking  sister, Kuu-Chan who are helping her to have the will to go on a relationship with the gringo (Hayao). What makes the story poor is that it&#039;s too messy to understand if it is an educational guide or is it a form of entertainment, there were also a couple of censors which adds to the poor rating, because if this anime is mend for adults then such strong words would not be a problem. <br />
<br />
Art- poor 3.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s because the characters seems to look like adults in teen-age bodies.<br />
<br />
Sound - Mediocre 5.<br />
<br />
Nothing much to say here.<br />
<br />
Characters - Poor 3.<br />
<br />
Ok, I really don&#039;t like the main gringo, Hayao Imagawa who&#039;s too eagerness to get laid he lacks observation as to how the chiquita, Andou Natsu state of mind is by instantly declaring his love for her. As of the deities, I kinda hate that both the god and the goddess whom were bisexual and same goes for their siblings, also, they&#039;re more of a nuisance to the main leads than a motivator, though I do appreciate their love tips, but that as far as it goes. But the thing here is that these deities can only talk the talk but not walk.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- Good 7.<br />
<br />
Even thought the story sucks the comedy part kinda makes up for it.<br />
<br />
Overall - Good 7.<br />
<br />
Well, it&#039;s a good adult anime, if there are things  that this pathetic anime can teach us, is that for men, chivalry is not dead and it should still be practice, being arrogant and self centered should not be mistaken for confidence and confidence is believing in yourself and moving on if things don&#039;t go right, being able to put yourself in a woman&#039;s place can help a lot and the most important thing is patience, co&#039;z sometimes love can come unexpectedly whether you&#039;re 30 or 40. For women, don&#039;t hesitate to speak your mind, co&#039;z men are not psychic, if you&#039;re to choose the best quality in men go for a nice guy, they may finish last, but they always have a good conscience and sometimes in order to get a guy you have to do the courting co&#039;z some hopeless romantic guy just need a little push from the opposite sex.

    COMMENTS:<br />
<br />
I was in an anime slump, y&#039;know the kind, you want to watch something but everything you watch is just wrong, yeah I was in one of those when I came across this.  It looked amusing enough and if there&#039;s one thing I&#039;m a sucker for it it&#039;s sex related humour.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY:<br />
<br />
30-sai Hoken Taiiku is about 30 year old Imagawa Hayao who has just bought a blow up sex doll who he calls Momoko. Did I mention Imagawa was a virgin? No? Well he is and he&#039;s about to deflower himself with a sex doll when Daigorou aka SexGod  magically appears in his house.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review91465">
        Daigorou mission? To get Imagawa some sex with real life living ladies and so the fun and games begin.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
STORY: 8/10<br />
<br />
<br />
I know I&#039;m probably being generous giving this show such a high score but I found it oddly refreshing. This show managed to take something which could be quite embarrassing to talk about and turn it into a comedy without it being overbearing and judgemental and I feel it did give some good advice and tackled a lot of hard to address issues. I also liked how the show wasn&#039;t just a case of &#039;go out get laid job done.&#039; Daigorou actually helped Imagawa to form a relationship and taught him to communicate with woman, along with how to do the sex.<br />
<br />
Did I also mention the comedy gold? This show had me in stitches.<br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: 8/10<br />
<br />
You&#039;d think with this show being a guidebook that characters would have no personality but this show somehow managed it. The two main characters and &#039;virgins&#039; are very believable not to mention they&#039;re not complete weirdos, normally they&#039;re virgins for a reason but these were two vey normal believable people who just had some slight issues with communicating and developing relationships.<br />
<br />
The supporting characters were less believable they were over the top and borderline ridiculous but that’s where your comedy came from.  There was not really any character development for the supporting characters they were there for the comedy and to help the two main characters develop and I was oddly okay with that.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION: 7/10<br />
<br />
There was nothing outstanding about the animation but that was okay since nothing needed to be outstanding. I feel Andou could have benefited from looking less child like since she is meant to be a woman in her 30&#039;s but I guess woman looking young and cute is a Japanese male fantasy.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 6/10<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t really notice the sound? Nothing sprang up rather than the ending song. The background music was just that, background music there was nothing special about it.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 8/10<br />
<br />
This show was really enjoyable and it kept me laughing for hours.  I wouldn&#039;t recommend it to people who aren&#039;t too fond of sex humor and I wouldn&#039;t really use it for a guide like it&#039;s meant to be since I can&#039;t really take it seriously but if you&#039;re looking for good old sex jokes to laugh at this is what you want.

    I really enjoyed this anime, don&#039;t let the title in english knock you off because this show is quite funny in it&#039;s own way especially when they say breast are justice LOL.<br />
If u watch it to the end it is quite satisfying end and an emotional one.

    My goodness this anime wins an award! FOR THE FASTEST ANIME I HAVE EVER DROPPED!!!!<br />
<br />
This piece of trash is the single most disturbing and trashy anime I have ever seen. <br />
Take one, hard good look at this cutesy adorable romance cover..... and this anime is the ABSOLUTE OPPOSITE of that. <br />
<br />
Ever wanted to see an eight year old, gender confused, little brother of a &quot;Sex God&quot; offering his body for practice to a boringass thirty year old virgin dude who is virgin for a reason so that he can be experienced enough to have sex with a real girl? Well then this is the anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320013">
        for you. No just kidding. STOP. YOU HAVE PROBLEMS. SEEK PROFESIONAL HELP IMMEDIATELY.<br />
<br />
Story: 0/10<br />
Dumbass 30 year old dude who is boring, perverted, and unlikable overall is visited by a gay &quot;God of Sex&quot; who refuses to leave until this guy has sex with a girl. Thats the story. <br />
<br />
Art: 4/10<br />
The art on the cover looks cute, right? And the art in the anime is a small step down... however they keep transitioning to poorly drawn animations and the backgrounds are awful. <br />
<br />
Sound: 2/10<br />
it doesnt have a soundtrack worth remembering. characters sound like shit too. sound quality is fine, but their voices made me sick. Just like this whole anime.<br />
<br />
Character: 0/10<br />
Nothing worth mentioning here. I met four characters in the 2 eps I watched.<br />
The Main character: boring blank slate pathetic loser dude with no life<br />
The Sex God: arrogant, perverted dude who acts like a gay asshole<br />
The Little Brother: no words here, this character is seriously disturbing<br />
The Supposed &quot;Love Interest:&quot; she might not be an awful character, but she was mainly just in the scene so the MC could act perverted and make a fool of himself in front of her.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: -10000000/10<br />
Worst anime I have ever seen. VERY misconceiving cover. <br />
<br />
Overall: <br />
It&#039;s literal shit. No one should see this. <br />
It starts off AWFUL and goes down the hell hole from there.

    The Anime is Pretty Funny !!! I almost cried laughing.I strong suggest this anime for people who are inexperienced in SEX or Virgins (like myself).<br />
It is pure Sex Comedy with Sex Ed , Not only for Men specifically, but for women too .  If You have time please watch this anime.The Story line is ok but the jokes and cute/erotic characters totally make up for it. <br />
but the ending was AWFUL.<br />

    Lesson 41:  &quot;If you do nothing, there will never be a chance&quot;<br />
<br />
30-sai no Hoken Taiiku is an odd one.  I came into it not sure what I&#039;d expect, and I was pleasantly surprised.  It&#039;s an over-the-top comedy (Yes it&#039;s not tagged as one but it really is) where two 30-year old virgins are guided by Sex Gods to lose their virginity.<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
<br />
The story was simple yet enjoyable.  It starts off with our main character turning 30 and trying to have sex with his blow-up doll to lose his virginity, but before he &quot;succeeds&quot; (if you&#039;d consider it success), a God of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review208192">
        sex appears in front of him stopping him.<br />
<br />
From that point onwards it just becomes ridiculous, hilarious yet somehow erm... educational.  Yup.  The God of sex and his brother try to teach the MC how to interact with females, how to hold conversations, how to ask her for a date etc. <br />
<br />
...But they also teach him about the pros and cons of sexual positions.<br />
<br />
Other than that it has a romance side-plot going along the comedy aspect, and it worked very well, considering it had more development than basically all the romance anime I&#039;ve seen.<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
<br />
The Art/Animation part of this anime seems to be getting a lot of slack from other people, which I can sort of understand.  It had this odd vibrant coloured, chibi-esque feel to it, kind of like Mr. Bean the animation.  Yet it worked surprisingly well considering the comedy.  There weren&#039;t any obvious animation fails, although there was a lack of movement in some scenes (budget I&#039;m assuming). <br />
<br />
Also I&#039;ve heard stories about a censored version being appalling so don&#039;t watch that one.<br />
<br />
Sound:  8<br />
<br />
Yes, the Sound was very good.  Light-hearted, catchy and  enjoyable OP (which I listened to every single time).  The OST was strangely addictive, with a couple of tunes still playing in my head.  Obviously they followed the OP&#039;s theme, being catchy and simple.  And the ED which I consider the best of the 3.  Besides following the previous 2 (listened to it every time) it did something that not enough anime do.  It changed part of the video (I guess you could call it) every episode.  It started off with the 2 main characters walking as babies to each other and every episode there&#039;s an older version of them doing the same thing, until reaching their current age in the final episode.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8<br />
<br />
A colourful set of characters, the 2 main ones obviously going through the most development.  Going from 2 people unable to even talk to the opposite gender to [SPOILER] dating like normal human beings [SPOILER].  I could see personality changes of the 2 main characters throughout the 12 episodes, and it put a smile to my face every time.  But they wouldn&#039;t be able to get where they are if not for our 4 background characters/gods helping them out in every step. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
<br />
It was an extremely enjoyable ride.  It made me laugh uncontrollably, smile and be happy about all the romance and excited to get into each new episode.  <br />
<br />
Surprised to see it rated so low so I&#039;ll give you guys some tips:<br />
- Don&#039;t take it too seriously.  It wasn&#039;t meant to be.  It was intended to be watched like you&#039;d watch Detroit Metal City, or One Punch Man (a more recent example).<br />
- Just have fun with it and you&#039;ll like it, trust me!<br />
<br />
P.S: My first review, be gentle.

    If you go into this show looking for a story, you&#039;re in for a bad time.<br />
Hi into it seeking Japanese style humour, which is often done at the expense of the characters with a mix of anime hentai-ness(perversion) so it can be a hot or miss for you.<br />
Eagle eyes viewers might find references to other animes like DBZ, Evangallion, Naruto and common anime cliches.<br />
<br />
It presents itself as a guide but teaches you very little that you wouldn&#039;t have already known as an average anime consumer. (Specially if you read lots of doujins)<br />
<br />
Lacks a backstory as in how the characters got to where they are now

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402589">
        and explores very little about the(Natsu) girl&#039;s side of experience. Very little was explored outside of the main topic. An anime like this could have easily been made long enough for 30+ episodes be it by adding more info or by going deeper into the story.<br />
<br />
The ending happens all of a sudden and we never get to see what the &#039;gods&#039; thought of their experience or if their own relationship that developed during last few episodes gets resolved.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: Why are they 30 year old? I guess, you can try writing 30 in roman.<br />

    30-sai no Hoken Taiiku was a decent anime. It was about sex, but not overtly inappropriate. There were censors where it was needed, but it&#039;s still kind of awkward to watch around family. Overall, I gave this anime an 8/10. Here&#039;s why:<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
The story follows a 30 year old virgin who&#039;s been sent a Sex God. Basically, a god that is trying to teach him how to get laid. If you look past this, there is an interesting love story that unfolds, and some random anime references throughout. It was pretty funny, if you&#039;re into that kind of thing, and I did sort of enjoy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311680">
        it. <br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
The art was great, don&#039;t get me wrong. I loved the style of the characters. It was a traditional anime style mixed with some chibis here and there. There was something pretty bad about the animation, so that docked some of the points from the art. It wasn&#039;t too bad to drop it below a seven though.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
I loved both the opening and ending for this anime. Sure, they didn&#039;t fit with the anime, being upbeat and catchy, but it was just a typical anime opening/ending. I will more than likely listen to both of the songs in my spare time. <br />
<br />
Character: 5/10<br />
There wasn&#039;t really any character development throughout the anime, but with the episodes being ten minutes each, and only having twelve episodes, I didn&#039;t expect much in that department. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
I enjoyed this anime quite a lot. I thought it was cute and funny. I would probably watch it again for the laughs maybe a year down the road. The only issue was, I could only watch it in spurts. With it being so short, only about two hours viewing time overall, I figured I would binge watch it in one night and move onto the next anime, but I couldn&#039;t watch too many episodes at once. That doesn&#039;t necessarily mean that I hated this anime, I&#039;m honestly not sure why I couldn&#039;t bring myself to watch the whole thing.

    30-sai is about divine intervention trying to help two 30-year-old virgins hit it up, quite literally. The divine intervention is in the form of a pair of sex gods, two per virgin. Underneath an unbelievable amount of ecchi content and references you&#039;ll find a very light romance. Throughout the show, though, I kept wondering whether this show is actually trying to serve as a helpful guide under the guise of comedy, or whether this show is just making fun of the topic of sexuality.<br />
<br />
This is quite a unique series. Apart from wondering how this ever got on TV, you&#039;ll also notice a very unique flavor

          <span style="display: none;" id="review202415">
        of comedy. I found some of these references humorous, but quite a few of the others in bad taste. This is an ecchi-comedy with a slight romantic development, and a random, short divergence to action-land. If you willing to sift through the ecchi overload, try out the first two episodes to see if it piques your interest.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
The animation of this series is, again, unique to say the least. The character models are a bit simplistic and often go into comic-mode (no backgrounds, few character details). Backgrounds are also very simplistic and solid-colored (no detailed shading). There are also portions where the animation style is purposefully grotesque (really ugly drawing style or dis-proportioned figures).<br />
However, most noticeable of all would be the ecchi. The show is full of endlessly censored frames. It&#039;s sometimes feels random as apparently french kissing by fake lips is filtered while a banana with two small tangerines next to a mango sliced in half is apparently totally fine. The main point in the show is to have the sex gods teach the virgins how to date and do things that follow a date, therefore, you should expect this to be very explicit at times; i.e. this is most definitely NSFW.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The OP is energetic but I don&#039;t particularly like the voice. The ED is a rock song with a fairly decent melody, and a fairly interesting sequence (shows the virgins as they grow up). Surprisingly enough, the BGM is actually quite memorable in this series. It plays a very significant role as many of the scenes are more visual-oriented than sound-oriented, there will almost always be some BGM playing.<br />
<br />
The VAs do a decent job but Imagawa really does sound like a scary creep at times. You will also get a lot of bleeped out lines as they can&#039;t say *** or **** or any other words that I also shouldn&#039;t be posting here.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story is told from the viewpoint of Imagawa and Andou, two virgins who now live with sex gods who refuse to leave until the former are no longer virgins. The two virgins eventually encounter each other and slowly learn how to date and grow closer through &quot;lessons&quot;. Some of these lessons are simple dating tips while others are attempts to get them more to be more comfortable with explicit content. These lessons form title screens that divide each episode. These somewhat spoil what&#039;s coming up so I&#039;d recommend not reading the subs for these. Even without the lesson titles, the story is very linear and isn&#039;t terribly deep. The focus is definitely on the comedic aspects, with a plot existing to support the comedic events.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Imagawa is completely creepy and sleeps with a blow up doll, while Andou is just embarrassed and ends up turning down anyone who approaches her. Though there is development as the virgins do learn eventually to interact at some level with the other gender, it feels artificial as the characters themselves don&#039;t have much depth. You never really get to know the actual virgins as the show primarily uses them as &quot;dolls&quot; to bring across the point of the lesson. Despite this, some of the character interactions are fairly humorous. Just don&#039;t expect the same warm fuzzy feeling that you&#039;d get from something like Amagami SS.<br />
<br />
Value:<br />
This is a short, light show that emphasizes that hanging out with the other gender can be fun. It gives some potentially useful dating tips as well as a whole lot of sexual references, most of which doesn&#039;t really serve any meaningful purpose. It was decently enjoyable but doesn&#039;t really have quite enough depth of characters. The end message is actually probably a good way to finish this off: &quot;If you do nothing, there will never be a chance!&quot;.

    Now this one is a little sketchy for some viewers. Probably not the best show to watch while kids are around. The story has its cute side and it&#039;s pretty enjoyable. If anything I would say its a great show for people in their 20&#039;s I suppose. It&#039;s comical and for American&#039;s it&#039;s pretty much like the movie 40 Year Old Virgin. Still I would recommend this anime to viewers who are at least aware of the strange subjects animes will push you into. For you Greenhorns out there. You&#039;ve been warned. Enjoy

    This is one crazy and outrageous anime. From the title alone I expected something a bit normal like a comedy or education anime within the bounds of reality. But this show defies logic and sense with all its craziness and weird antics.<br />
<br />
Plot: The story starts off with our main protagonist ,30 year old male virgin (Hayao Imagawa) ,trying to have intercourse with momoko-chan (a sex doll, that&#039;s just sad really), when out of nowhere pops out a naked guy (Daigorou a pervert.. err.. the God of Sex). And in Hayao&#039;s shock he turns Momoko-chan into the God Board. At first Hayao was defiant but when

          <span style="display: none;" id="review136253">
        Daigorou forces him to do something bad.. really really bad like an %@$&amp; Vacuum, Hayao unsurprisingly quickly had a change of heart.<br />
<br />
The plot revolves around Daigorou and little brother Macaron&#039;s weird and creepy antics as they try to help Hayao avoid becoming a wizard. The Female protagonist Natsu Andou a virgin herself is in the same boat as our male protagonist as she too gets accompanied by two female Sex Gods. Both pairs of Gods and Goddesses kinda isn&#039;t fond of each other.Our hero and heroine will have to face many challenges before they could become &quot;one&quot;. At one point Hayao&#039;s hopes of getting past the virgin stage will hit rock bottom when he succumbs to giving up and ended becoming the virgin prince and Andou will let herself really go due to insecurities and stresses of her own.But all&#039;s well that ends well, as the four Gods and Goddesses settle their differences and joined forces to help our two lovebirds muster up the courage to do what they had to do.<br />
<br />
Review: It&#039;s an okay show to watch if you want a good laugh, the topics aren&#039;t really for children but no &quot;ecchi&quot; here, and a lot of things are hilariously censored, muted and blurred. The plot itself is straightforward and light with heavy doses of weirdness and outrageous stuff. If you liked the first episode then expect the same thing for the rest.<br />
<br />
My Personal Rating:7/10

    If you&#039;re looking for a cute simple anime to follow that has subtle and not-so-subtle adult jokes in it than this anime is for you. This show had my laughing out loud with the adult jokes and visuals, as well as the character interactions with one another. The side characters are memorable just as much as the main characters and have great personalities. I&#039;m not usually a big fan of ecchi but this show did it in a way that I didn&#039;t feel like it was thrown in front of me like some other shows I&#039;ve seen such as High School of the Dead and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328651">
        Monster Musume (Still love those ones though!). The ecchi in this show is more subtle and usually only used for comedy rather than just to be there as fan service. As far as the episodes go, they&#039;re shorter than your standard 23 minute anime but still enjoyable and was perfect for when I didn&#039;t feel like sitting through a full-length anime episode. The art is very cutesy but I loved that. It&#039;s different than the generic anime art-style currently and I love all different art-styles in anime so that was a nice change for me personally. Definitely give it a chance!

    30-sai no Hoken Taiiku (30HT) is supposed to be a sex guide for 30 year old virgins but only ends up being a light time-waster. The concept is very interesting and there have been some other attempts at it along the years, but they all end up taking the comedy routine and are thus mostly erotic comedies (or even parodies of this sad situation) so don’t exactly expect to learn how to get yourself wise and deflowered by watching it.<br />
<br />
There is no other way to explain how dull it felt for me without comparing it to the oldest of this kind, a set of OVAs

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320278">
        titled Futari Ecchi (FE) and in a way it is a semi-review of it as well. Whatever, once again the first title of a genre is the best and the point of reference to all those that followed it. Don’t blame me if the successors of an idea barely manage to do something better with it.<br />
<br />
The anime adaptation only covers the first chapters of an extremely long and still on-going manga but the issue is dealt in a very bold and interesting way. 30HT on the other hand is hardly trying to have the same feeling and context. So compared to FE, it loses on all aspects.<br />
- Very short episodes. No time to get into the mood properly.<br />
- Censorship of the bad kind. FE was keeping the naughty parts invisible or replaced them with bananas. Here, they use these stupid boxes that hide everything and they can’t even speak basic naughty words without being BLEEPED.<br />
- The advises it gives are mostly about dating and flirting, and even those are things most people know anyhow. FE was about ACTUAL sex education.<br />
- Barely any actual sex; the whole show is a slow build-up with high amounts of non-H ecchi towards the first time, while FE was beginning straight with it.<br />
- Stupid Deus ex machina cupids. I mean seriously, you get these supernatural chibi thingies messing with the characters lives because fate demands it or something. HORSE SHIT! FE was always about normal people having to find the guts and the brains to learn and do things right on their own instead of waiting some miracle to happen. Noce messages you give use there you stupid show; it’s like only God can help middle aged virgins.<br />
- Not many characters present. Although FE was also focusing on the main two, there were still many others (especially in the manga) whose advises and their own sex life issues were constantly present to flavour the plot. Over here it remains very basic and linear.<br />
- Low production values. Ok, they weren’t that high in FE either, but DAMN look how cute everybody looks. The cupids are excused somewhat but the main characters are supposed to be middle aged people and look like they are still twelve or something. Stupid moe fad; leave me alone!<br />
<br />
So after all this mess what are you left with? A high amount of sex jokes around a four-eyed dork and a frustrated damsel. They are pitiful and I guess there will be many amongst the target audience who will identify with their issues. They are also kept as blunt as possible to make them as identifiable as possible but that is exactly what makes them nothing more than generic plot devises and not fleshed out personalities. Plus, the show DOESN’T teach you anything significant. The FE manga had endless charts of statistics and graphs and stuff about the human body but this one is just the basic stuff you can learn by simply scrolling through porn sites or something.<br />
<br />
So in all, it is not much of a title to have high expectations about. Watching any high calibre ecchi or harem show will most likely be more entertaining than this for having better production values and for not pretending to be meaningful.<br />
<br />
And now for some excused scorings.<br />
<br />
ART SECTION: 3/10 [Cute-looking but otherwise run-down]<br />
Analysis: General Artwork 0/2, Character Figures 1/2, Backgrounds 0/2, Animation 1/2, Visual Effects 1/2<br />
<br />
SOUND SECTION: 6/10 [Nothing that stands out]<br />
Analysis: Voice Acting 2/3, Music Themes 2/4, Sound Effects 2/3<br />
<br />
STORY SECTION: 5/10 [Very basic and far-fetched for its premise]<br />
Analysis: Premise 2/2, Pacing 1/2, Complexity 1/2, Plausibility 0/2, Conclusion 1/2<br />
<br />
CHARACTER SECTION: 4/10 [Everyone is a plot devise]<br />
Analysis: Presence 0/2, Personality 1/2, Backdrop 1/2, Development 1/2, Catharsis 1/2<br />
<br />
VALUE SECTION: 1/10 [Meh, doesn’t really offer anything worthy to remember] [/b]<br />
Analysis: Historical Value 0/3, Rewatchability 0/3, Memorability 1/4<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT SECTION: 2/10 [/b]<br />
A bit funny but other than that Futari Ecchi eats this one for a snack.<br />
<br />
VERDICT: 3.5/10
