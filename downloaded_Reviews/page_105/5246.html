    For centuries, it has been man&#039;s dream to fly.  Because of the Wright Brothers, we finally have the technology to do so, and as such, have been able to soar into the skies, give or take the method.  But we have never truly been able to fly by ourselves.  But here, we have Aokana, an anime about flying, and the sport that goes along with it known as Flying Circus.<br />
<br />
Story:  In the world of Aokana, the world has developed special footwear called Grav-shoes, a kind of footwear that allows for the user to utilize anti-graviton particles in order to essentially defy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214600">
        gravity and fly.  In order to make the idea of Grav-shoes more fun, a new sport known as Flying Circus was developed, creating a brand new activity that one could do with their new shoes.  It is here where we meet Kurashina Asuka, a bright and optimistic girl who dreams of soaring in the skies.<br />
<br />
At its core, Aokana is centered around Asuka and her journey through the sport of Flying Circus, or FC for short.  The show is centered around her and her group of friends in the FC club at her high school, participating in competitions and aiming to become top FC players.  So more or less, this is your standard tournament/sports anime that focuses around beating stronger opponents and progressively getting better and better as time goes on, right?  Well...no, actually.  <br />
<br />
Contrary to what the show looks like from the outside, Aokana has a surprisingly deep set of values that it showcases.  It really hammers in what it takes to be good at a sport, and the satisfaction of winning when facing someone tough.  In fact, the characters are shown to more or less only be fighting the same opponents, completely disregarding a &#039;stronger challenger approaches&#039; style of story.  The anime shows us the true feeling of losing and how heartbreaking it can be, as well as the beauty and satisfaction of winning, all things that you wouldn&#039;t see in your generic tournament anime where the protagonist just barrels his/her way through each match without trying and winning every time because he/she is that good.  There&#039;s genuine feeling when it comes to seeing the growth of these characters and it really made me like this show and want to continue watching.  The progression is far better than what I had expected it to be, and I was happy to receive such a surprise.<br />
<br />
On the downside though, the show has some issues with some of its presentation.  Some aspects of the show feel cliched and everything is tied up with a nice ribbon bow, so the plot is predictable in that regard.  Additionally, the show does have quite a lot of moe-affiliated moments where the show does tell you once again &quot;Hey, we&#039;re a show with a bunch of cute girls doing some cute stuff&quot;, which it is.  It takes away from the serious atmosphere a little bit, but for me, it really wasn&#039;t really a problem.  <br />
<br />
Overall, while there were problems and issues with its presentation, Aokana had a message that was far deeper than I thought it would ever have given what it looked like on the outside.  The show had good progression and a good mix of good to bad moments that helped improve character growth and, despite its appearance of one guy surrounded by several girls, IS NOT A HAREM!  (I know, shocking right?  We can have an anime with that kind of character setup WITHOUT having romance!  Gasp!)<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  Interesting story concept  (The sport is simple, but surprisingly complex.)<br />
+  Great message and themes throughout<br />
+  Not a harem despite what we get for a cast<br />
-   Has cliched and/or predictable moments that do take some credibility of the show away<br />
<br />
Characters:  The cast of Aokana isn&#039;t particularly big.  As mentioned before, the show more or less focuses on a relatively small group of characters where they all fight amongst each other in the sport.  There&#039;re no &quot;Challenger-kuns&quot; anywhere once the rivals have been established, and the show takes its time to develop its cast.<br />
<br />
First, we have our spunky and optimistic main protagonist, Kurashina Asuka.  Asuka is the very definition of optimism.  Her dream is to soar high in the sky, and most of her lines involve things being &quot;amazing&quot; and being &quot;spectacular&quot; to the point that it&#039;s actually somewhat annoying.  A somehow gifted natural at FC, Asuka is sort of that &#039;prodigy&#039; kind of character who gets stuff or is able to do complicated stuff relatively easy in the series, even to the extent that even towards the end, she is able to handle more difficult maneuvers or strategies that would ordinarily taken someone else weeks or even months to accomplish.  As a character, she is more of a catalyst for things, as she evokes feelings and aids in the character development for others, without really changing much herself.  She does have bouts of sadness and some time dedicated to her recovery after a loss, but she&#039;s the type to get back up on her feet quickly, so there&#039;s really no worry there.<br />
<br />
The people that are interesting are both Mashiro and Misaki, the two other members of the FC club that Asuka belong to.  As a senpai loving kouhai and a nyanko respectively, Mashiro and Misaki are more of the characters that project and showcase the quality of what it is to have ups and downs in a sport, as each of them have dedicated time to their characters.  These areas of the anime are sections where I think both the message and the anime really shine, because they&#039;re both very realistic examples of what it means to participate and try to get really into a sport since both of their mini character arcs are dedicated to resolving their own insecurities and strengthening the qualities that they possess and turning it into in the series&#039; words, &quot;Their own FC&quot;, aka, their own style of playing.  <br />
<br />
If I was to make a complaint, it would have to be geared towards Masaya Hinata, our male character guy.  Masaya is a character who really...doesn&#039;t have all that much importance in this series.  As Aokana was originally a VN before getting adapted, Masaya is the player character and is dictated by the actions of the player.  In the anime, Masaya more or less plays a supporting role to the series, which is fine since I&#039;m all for a series with 1 guy and a bunch of girls that isn&#039;t a harem series, but they try to give an explanation and time to his backstory and why he decided &#039;never to fly again&#039; which just ends up being incomplete and very lackluster.  It is by far the weakest aspect of the characters by far, which is surprising since the side characters not only get more screentime, but more development than our so-called male protagonist here.<br />
<br />
The side characters are definitely a side cast that has more worth to this series than most anime I&#039;ve seen.  Other FC players like Shindou, Inui, and Rika get little moments dedicated to them to add onto the message that the show coaxes in, and Madoka, who is more or less the comedic straight man to everyone (poor Madoka).  Point being, there are members of this side cast that deserve mention, and only add to this show since a good number of them actually develop along with the series, if only for a little bit of character development.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Great character development<br />
+ Good focus on main females and their development<br />
+ Side cast members also get development<br />
-  Asuka is a bit too perfect sometimes and gets a bit annoying<br />
-  Masaya, the supposed main character, is basically nonexistent to this series<br />
<br />
Art:  Produced by Gonzo, Aokana boasts a very high quality and whimsical looking style for Aokana.  All of the colors have this shimmering bright sheen to them that reflects the sunny and bright feeling that the show evokes, creating this wonderfully colorful show that looks very pleasing to look at.  The characters also look very nice in conjunction with the background and move very fluidly in terms of the normal animation fluidity.  The artstyle is heavily moe-centered, as the characters, girls in particularly, are drawn in a very cutesy style coupled with some cutely exaggerated moments at a shot at comedy and cute pictures.  I say this because there are people that REALLY hate moe, so I just wanted to mention it here.<br />
<br />
Another thing that the show has is effects, and lots of them.  The grav-shoes create contrails when the fly, and the effects of those are just really stunning to look at.  One thing that does bug me about the anime is the fact that they utilize 3-D CGI very often when they&#039;re trying to make a flying scene.  Using CGI for stuff like this is understandable, since the characters are moving very fast, and the amount of frame per second in order to create something like that would be time consuming to say the least, but the CGI is done in a way that really looks obvious, especially due to the fact that the fluidity of that particular scene looks stranger than it normally is.  (Also, there really isn&#039;t much fanservice to be had.  We get like...1 bath scene or so, and that&#039;s about it in the way of fanservice.)<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  Really nice artwork<br />
+  Great effects<br />
-   CGI wasn&#039;t meshed well and stood out easily<br />
<br />
Sound: The OST for Aokana is very fitting for the series.  The entire OST is more or less performed with airy instruments like the flute, in order to keep up with the theme of flying up and whatnot.  The OP &quot;Contrails&quot; is a very vibrant and uplifting piece that fits with the positive, soaring feeling that the characters have when they sprout their wings and lift off.  It&#039;s a very happy song that while doesn&#039;t have a staggeringly large amount of memorable factor to it, it&#039;s still a good song.<br />
<br />
The ED on the other hand is a more toned down song that has a similar soaring feeling to it.  But instead of soaring high, the song more or less drifts around and glides.  It&#039;s not particularly a song that I feel lacks in comparison to its OP.  It&#039;s not a bad song, but its calm and generic sound really doesn&#039;t really do the song any favors for being particularly memorable.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  Good, fitting music<br />
-   Not really a memorable OST<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment:  Aokana was that one show this season that out of every show in my watching list I thought would turn out to be a surprisingly good show, a dark horse that was good, but no one would watch.  And now, after finishing it, turns out, I was right.  It has its flaws and its problems, but honestly?  I really think that this was a good show; an unexpectedly good show.  <br />
<br />
Did I like this anime?<br />
<br />
To be honest, I really did.  I liked it far more than I thought I would.  It&#039;s unassumingly cute exterior hides a really deep and meaningful set of themes that was not only well tackled, but really played into why I think that this anime deserves far more attention than it gets.  Hell, the OP has the phrase &quot;True Battle comes After Losing&quot;, and that could not be more true to what happens in this show, and in real life.  Also, flying shoes.  Science, get on it.<br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I like about this anime?<br />
<br />
Ok, I&#039;ll be honest, Asuka is a bit irritating.  Her constant optimism is a feature of the anime that really doesn&#039;t fall, which really isn&#039;t a good thing.  She sees the bright side of practically everything and doesn&#039;t falter which in a sense, clashes with what this show was trying to convey.  In addition, Masaya was just NOT used.  He had so much potential, and could&#039;ve really added a lot to the series, but in the end, he was more or less shoved to the side and wasn&#039;t really as important as he could&#039;ve or should&#039;ve been.  (And yes, I know that Asuka IS the main character here.  Doesn&#039;t mean we couldn&#039;t have devoted more focus to Masaya.)<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this anime?<br />
<br />
Personally, I think that this anime is definitely worth a watch.  While it looks all cutesy and moe on the outside (which...it honestly does do a lot, quite a bit actually...), what the show tries to tell us with its themes gives the show far more worth than your seasonal generic moe show.  It tells us that enjoying the things we like doing is more important than winning or losing, and that work has to be put into something in order to get better, and it conveys these messages so well!  IMO, Aokana is an underrated show from Winter 2016, and despite its flaws, is still worth a watch.

    It took me far longer to get this review out than I had originally planned. But alas, it&#039;s here!<br />
<br />
AoKana was a series that I was extremely hyped up for, without a doubt more than anything from the Winter 2016 season. Why? Delving a bit into the past, I read three routes of the visual novel back in June of 2015, all of which were self-translated using my knowledge of katakana/hiragana and a dictionary. It took a very long time, however I thought it was well worth it in the end simply because of how much I enjoyed it. Well more than enough to throw it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review217071">
        in as one of my top 3 visual novels of all time, which is a pretty large thing for me to say given that I&#039;ve read quite a few of them in my life.<br />
<br />
AoKana was a series to have its anime adaptation announced before the visual novel had even come out, which was about a year and a half prior to the anime&#039;s first episode original air date. Was I a bit skeptical by this, given that it likely means that the anime&#039;s only goal will be to advertise a brand new visual novel and not as much to be a good anime? Of course I was. However, what made me believe that this anime would be hard to screw up was just how much adaptation potential the visual novel had.<br />
<br />
Now, what do I mean by that last statement? Basically, I felt that the visual novel would&#039;ve fit far better within the medium of anime than it would in its visual novel form. In a way, I thought potential was being wasted by it being a visual novel, despite how good of a visual novel it was. So, to me, it would be extremely hard to screw up this adaptation, even if the studio in charge is one with as lousy of a history as Gonzo. That is, as long as it isn&#039;t rushed... which, sadly, the announcement of it only being 12 episodes long made me believe that it would end up pretty rushed.<br />
<br />
Since you can, obviously, see my score of the series, you probably already know what I&#039;m going to say about it, however let&#039;s still get on with the review.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t want to say the story of AoKana is cliche, because it really isn&#039;t. It deals with sci-fi themes involving humans being able to fly, and a sport that&#039;s never existed outside of the universe of AoKana. However, the way these themes are dealt with is a bit cliche/genetic, in a way.<br />
<br />
Meet our main character, Masaya Hinata. He has decided to quit the game that this anime is based on, Flying Circus (FC), forever. That is, until he meets a girl named Asuka Kurashina, who has always dreamed of flying in the sky. When she learns about FC from Masaya, she decides that she wants to play more than anything, and also asks Masaya to be her coach. Masaya eventually agrees to be her coach, which means he must continue to make FC a significant part of his life, despite no longer wanting to be a part of it.<br />
<br />
Do you understand how I say this is cliche in its own way? Despite the fact that it deals with completely fresh concepts, such as humans being able to fly and a sport that has never existed outside of this universe, the entire grabber of the series is still just a chain of cliche, generic, overused events that have happened far too many times in anime. Guy never wants to play a certain thing ever again for what we can likely assume is because of a past event, but suddenly a cute girl is so interested in it and wants him to help her through it, so he decides to abandon his own morals and help her. Sounds kind of familiar, doesn&#039;t it?<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s really all AoKana is for the first 4 or so episodes. The entire situation and the events that happen have been used far too many times to consider anything but generic. However, it&#039;s when you&#039;re able to slog through those first 4 episodes that you realize how good this series truly is. But first, sadly, I need to talk about what makes those first 4 episodes as bad as they are.<br />
<br />
1. Everything&#039;s been used a million times.<br />
As I said above, the first 4 episodes are really generic. As Asuka wants to start playing in this new sport, she joins her school&#039;s sports team, and is met with other cute girls that basically surround Masaya the entire time. It&#039;s then that we learn that the uniforms used to play FC are really tight and slightly skimpy outfits that bring out the T&amp;A of these girls. Then, a string of really cliche things happen, such as the girls having sleepovers or being caught in awkward situations, going to the mall together to get Asuka the FC gear she needs to play, and fanservice. LOTS of fanservice.<br />
<br />
2. The pacing and quality is terrible.<br />
As I originally predicted, the first 4 episodes of AoKana are definitely rushed. Things go by way too fast to really consider them &quot;remarkable&quot; in even the slightest way, and you&#039;re given almost no time to savor the events that happen. The ONLY time that the pacing slows down is when you WANT it to be rushed; during massive fanservice scenes, like bath scenes and the like.<br />
As for the quality, there are TONS of DBZ-style continuous three-frame animation sequences that are used to cut down budget while still making it look like things are happening. Again, this only changes during scenes of fanservice. Things like that are good for boosting sales of the source material.<br />
<br />
3. It&#039;s BOOOOOOOOORING.<br />
It honestly DOES feel like not a whole lot is happening throughout these first 4 episodes, despite that being the exact opposite. What do I mean by that? When you finish the first 4 episodes, you will think back and only really remember the character introductions and what&#039;s happened to develop them thus far. The story progression won&#039;t feel like much has happened, but that&#039;s far from the truth. This is where we go back to it being extremely rushed. It&#039;s so rushed that far too many things are cut out that shouldn&#039;t be, and thus it feels like nothing has happened when in reality, quite a bit has happened. Like, lots. This was a major flaw that I feared when it was announced that AoKana would only be 12 episodes.<br />
<br />
4. Character progression<br />
Overwhelming character progression doesn&#039;t really sound like it&#039;d be a bad thing to most people when first hearing about it, but in the first 4 episodes of AoKana, it KINDA is. While I, personally, didn&#039;t think it was all that bad, many other people did. By as early as episode 2, there were people out there who were already getting sick of Asuka&#039;s character, which really shouldn&#039;t have been the case so early on. Her character was one that was meant to be adored quite a bit. This was a slight problem for Mashiro as well, but I didn&#039;t really hear a lot of complaints regarding her, so I supposed all is well there.<br />
<br />
Alright, so I know what you&#039;re thinking so far. &quot;Why the hell did you give this an 8/10? This sounds like a piece of crap so far!&quot; Honestly, that was my goal here. To make the series sound like total crap up to this point. Because, in all honesty, that&#039;s really what it was up until episode 5. It sucked. To the point where I ended up dropping it until about a month after it had finished airing, despite how anticipated I was to watch it originally.<br />
<br />
Then, we get to what I like to call the &quot;meat and potatoes&quot; of the series... the good part, the part that was right on-par with the rest of the visual novel, and that was just as I had expected from an anime adaptation of this wonderful visual novel: something that I could even say was BETTER than the source material.<br />
I probably wouldn&#039;t go as far as to actually say that, but at the very least, both were equally as good from this point on.<br />
<br />
EPISODES 5-12:<br />
It&#039;s almost instantly notable how much better the pacing is in episodes 5 and 6. You&#039;re able to savor almost everything that happens. Also, the quality of the show looks and feels much better; very little fanservice happens beyond reason, the art looks much more fluid, and there aren&#039;t really any situations where three-frame animation would take center stage and lower the quality of anything else. It all looks done well, and it made me happy how much better it was than the first 4 episodes.<br />
<br />
The story begins to actually take off in episode 7, where we learn a lot of things that are crucial to the rest of the series, as well as crucial to some things that happened in past episodes. Mainly, the past of some characters, as well as within the psyche of another dominant character.<br />
<br />
I think episodes 8-12 were without a doubt some of the best episodes I&#039;ve ever seen in anime, or at the very least, some that I enjoyed the very most. What I really dislike about reviewing is that I can&#039;t go into depth with that without spoiling, but at the very least, listen to my words. The storytelling is incredibly well-done, the characters are delved into deeper and deeper outside of just continuous progression like in the first 4 episodes, and things start to matter a lot more. You start to become more and more attached to the characters/story of this series, maybe even more than you ever imagined you could, given how badly the first 4 episodes were done.<br />
<br />
I also want to give my props to the director. Sometimes, poor directing can lead to a series being far worse than it really is, despite how good the story/characters may be. The directing of AoKana was top-notch, done perfectly for what it&#039;s worth. And I also LOVED that Wings of Courage was used in episode 12. Thank you for that. That made my entire day.<br />
<br />
So overall, the story of AoKana goes like this:<br />
Episodes 1-4 = no<br />
Episodes 5-7 = yes<br />
Episodes 8-12 = HELL YES<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
The characters of AoKana are some of my very favorite to ever come from a visual novel. This wasn&#039;t really changed very much in the anime adaptation, aside from the first 2-3 episodes. The personalities of all the characters were kept almost exactly the same, and were only skewered a bit in the beginning but were quickly put back on track.<br />
<br />
Personally, Asuka was my favorite. I do agree that she was depicted to be far more annoying and clingy than she actually is in the first 2 episodes, and the constant &quot;COACHY!!&quot; that flew out of her mouth every 5 seconds did become obnoxious after a while. But, as I implied above, this was a very short-last thing. Even during episodes 3 and 4, which I also thought were very lousy and unworthy of being a part of this series, I still thought Asuka&#039;s character was great and depicted well for what we were given.<br />
<br />
Besides Asuka, there was no character I liked a great deal, but that doesn&#039;t change the fact that they were still depicted very well in accordance to the series as a whole. Were those other characters perfect? Obviously not, or else I would&#039;ve loved all of them! Nah, but they were still far greater than typical generic harem bait characters that you&#039;d usually see in a series like this.<br />
<br />
If I haven&#039;t mentioned already, there&#039;s NO romance in this series whatsoever. It&#039;s almost entirely based on the FC sport, which is a breath of fresh air given that any other series that was composed like this, especially one based off of a visual novel, would end up just being a huge harem where every girl wants to get with the dude. That isn&#039;t the case here in the anime.<br />
<br />
I really thought the characters here were done exceptionally, and almost perfect in a way. Asuka is without a doubt one of my favorite characters of all time, and none of the other characters had enough flaws to consider anything LESS than very good. Overall, almost flawless, just simply fantastic characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Sound:<br />
<br />
One thing that key visuals/concept art of the anime made me realize, was just how similar the character designs were to the visual novel. That&#039;s a pretty rare thing, as visual novels typically look much better given that still images are used instead of actual animation. Minus Grisaia no Kajitsu and its sequels/prequels, VERY few visual novel adaptations have art that looks even half as good as it did in the visual novel.<br />
<br />
There are some distinctive differences between the art styles of the two, with the most apparent one being the color choices. However, those are very simple to get used to, and you will get used to them very quickly. If you&#039;re someone coming into this anime without any prior reading of the visual novel, you will love the art from the get-go and that will be that.<br />
<br />
The sound, however, was nothing special at all. While I did love the opening, the insert of Wings of Courage in episode 12, and thought the ending was pretty great as well, that was really the only exceptional pieces of the entire soundtrack. The rest of it complemented the anime pretty well, and I have no complaints overall. But nothing stood out enough to be considered that great.<br />
<br />
As I said, however, I still have no complaints. It was still a good soundtrack, and I&#039;ll rate it as such.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Final verdict:<br />
<br />
AoKana is a bit of a hidden gem. It is certainly not perfect, and really is nothing amazing besides the very last few episodes. However, it is still well worth the watch simply because of how fresh it is and how enjoyable it is. The cliche start to the series ends up taking a great new face by turning into something that&#039;s enjoyable beyond even some of the greatest anime out there. Everything changes after those first 4 episodes, and it becomes something almost impossible to dislike. AoKana is, without a doubt, good enough to consider the 2nd best series by studio Gonzo thus far, behind only Welcome to the NHK.<br />
<br />
Story - 8, it had its flaws in the beginning but the last 8 episodes are, for the most part, flawless in doing what they try to do. Delves much deeper than you&#039;d ever expect in the later parts of the series.<br />
Character - 9, every character did exactly what they were meant to, and Asuka did much more than that by being just simply amazing.<br />
Art - 9, almost identical to the amazing art of the visual novel.<br />
Sound - 7, good soundtrack but nothing stood out aside from a few external things.<br />
Enjoyment - 9, there are few series out there that I enjoy more than this one. No kidding.<br />
<br />
Overall score for AoKana: Four Rhythm Across the Blue: 8/10.<br />
A great series through and through, but nothing too amazing. It had its flaws early on but once it corrected them, it was pretty freaking incredible.<br />
<br />
Who would I recommend this series to:<br />
If you like sports anime, you&#039;ll surely like this one.<br />
If you&#039;re sick of the same cliches that happen in sports anime and want a fresh experience, you&#039;ll surely like this anime as it is an incredibly fresh take on the sports sub-genre.<br />
If you&#039;ve never watched a sports anime before, this is surely a good place to start.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, if you want an enjoyable anime with good characters and fantastic art, you should consider checking out AoKana. Just remember, get through the first 4 episodes with understanding that it gets MUCH better after that. Don&#039;t think the entire series is going to be as bad as those first 4 episodes, because I can assure you that&#039;s NOT the case at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading my review! See you guys next time.<br />

    They should really drop the romance tag on this. (EDIT - Not anymore, thanks XEELTom for giving me the heads up! :) )<br />
 <br />
Quick summary - in a world where people have flying shoes there exists a sport that&#039;s called Flying Circus. Basically you touch four poles as fast as you can or you whack the opponent&#039;s back or well, you prevent the opponent from doing so. Not really much of a premise there LOL.<br />
<br />
This was pretty much a sleeper hit, it was a really outstanding show from start to end considering it was based off a VN. Instead, they dropped the romance and made

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214762">
        it all about the sport and the girls, which was a very good approach. Character development was surprisingly well done.<br />
<br />
All in all, if you are looking for a light hearted sport anime, this should fill that palate of yours.<br />

    It&#039;s a whole new anime story...new ideas. In this anime,it&#039;s all about flying which makes it more interesting as they compete for the champion title. Other than that, man all those new design and stuffs really makes me want to live in Japan.<br />
<br />
 Sound:<br />
The sound had nothing wrong. It fused with it vey well especially when they are in a dog fight! The voice actress and actor had a nice voice. It&#039;s very clear.The sound of the sea breeze and the wind is quite spot on when putting on earphones which is quite good.<br />
<br />
Design and graphics:<br />
A lot of kawai school girls with their newly designed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214798">
        outfit for competition and it&#039;s quite catchy XD.Graphics are impressive of the waves and the character&#039;s expression of how serious they are during competition so there&#039;s nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
At first it&#039;s gonna be not so bored since it&#039;s the introduction. Then, everything went fired up. Starts to get exciting, mind blown like WOW!!<br />
<br />
All I want to say that is Go and watch it!

    Do you like side boob?<br />
Do you like mediocre animation?<br />
Do you like a show that say&#039;s &#039;romance&#039; but has Zero romance?<br />
Do you like when a character gets better with no explanation?<br />
Do you enjoy an anime that make&#039;s you say &quot;huh?&quot; every five minutes?<br />
Well then Ao No Kanata is the anime for you.<br />
<br />
The only reason I continued to watch this sorry excuse for a &quot;Romance&quot; anime is because I actually thought there would be some in it. SPOILER ALERT There is ZERO romance in this anime.<br />
<br />
The game of flying circus seemed interesting in the very beginning but they never go into more details about the game and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214749">
        it&#039;s backstory.<br />
<br />
I feel like I already wasted my time writing a review for this, so I&#039;ll sum up this anime easily.<br />
<br />
Basically this anime is like someone playing Basketball for the first time.<br />
SPOILER...kind of.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They have no idea what they are doing, suddenly, the next day, they cannot be stopped, then you think that they can&#039;t get better...well think again because they become the best in the land!

    The anime for people who are passionate about flying and sports. The anime, which has a great main concept/story line, but tries to strive for a little bit too much.<br />
<br />
|Objective Review|<br />
<br />
|Story/Plot|<br />
The anime starts out well, sets up the scene well for the characters and the sci-fi sport called &quot;Flying Circus&quot;. The story progresses at a good pace, making it easy to keep up, yet keeping it interesting enough. However, as the series go on, the anime tries to reach too high. As a result, there will be a lot of plot lines that are not properly developed or finished. For example, the anime sets up

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256417">
        Hinata as one of the main characters with his trauma, but instead pushes him into the background into a supporting role. The supposedly romance story line is also left there hanging. There are a couple of signs of it, but it just never really happens or even starts to develop. Overall, it just seems like the main sports/tournament story line is very well put together, meanwhile all the other ones were ignored and unfinished in the end.<br />
Plot Score - 6 <br />
<br />
|Sports|<br />
As this anime is focused all around Flying Circus, it&#039;s quite important to see what the anime can bring to the sports lovers. The fantasy sports at it&#039;s core is fairly simple, but it still has plenty of depth. There are a fair amount of moves/tricks you can utilize, though it would have been nice to see more. As for strategies goes, it&#039;s a little bit lacking. It mostly just deciding whether to race or battle. In the end Inui does show some actual strategy, but it still feels a bit lacking. The rules also have some holes, like why not just skip to the third buoy instead of stopping to intercept. But all in all, the sports is fairly easy to pick up, not to mention it&#039;s a very flashy sports meaning it&#039;s good to watch. It just lacks a little bit of depth.<br />
Sports Score - 7<br />
<br />
|Sci-fi|<br />
Even though in the beginning we don&#039;t know too much about the Grav-Shoes, in the latter part of the series we learn a lot more about them. It really gives more options for the anime to expand the sports. One of the reasons why the sports aspect of the anime doesn&#039;t become too boring at the end.<br />
<br />
|Characters|<br />
The characters are mostly cute and nice, but nothing particularly outstanding. The drama part of the anime is nothing too serious, it&#039;s just mostly rivalry which is used nicely to develop the characters and their relationships. It&#039;s a nice touch that they use multiple forms of rivalries for different couples, there are couples where it&#039;s just a friendly/mutual connection where others might be more tense. However, the way they set up Hinata and Kagami, it only seemed right to see them a little bit more (especially Hinata with his trauma). This, unfortunately, is almost completely forgotten and it&#039;s almost like the creators totally forgot about their existence.<br />
Character Score - 8(for the MCs) - 4(for the rest) - 5 overall<br />
<br />
|Art|<br />
The art is just spectacular. The drawing is clear and the shading is very fine and soft. The overall style also complements the anime with it&#039;s bright happy ambiance. The animation throughout the series is pretty consistent and the effects smooth in with the rest of the animation greatly.<br />
Art Score - 9<br />
<br />
|Sound|<br />
The sounds are also quite outstanding. While the voice acting and music is fairly good, it&#039;s the sound effects that really made this anime/sport enjoyable to watch. They are clear, crisp and really do give off a feeling of speed.<br />
Sound Score - 8<br />
<br />
|The whole package|<br />
As a whole, the Flying Circus is a very easy to watch sport with spectacular audio-visual experience. The sport mechanics itself are nothing too special, but they do the job. If you want to just relax and watch some fantasy sports, then this is for you. Just make sure you don&#039;t expect nothing else other than a good tournament &quot;documentary&quot;. If you expect to see good comedy, romance, support characters, drama then you will probably get disappointed.<br />
<br />
All in all, if i had to put it into words, the anime has a great core, but the shell surrounding it is very fragile and has holes in it. For what it&#039;s supposed to be, it does the job very well, but it strives for more and then just flops.<br />
Overall Score - 6.5(if you look at what it&#039;s supposed to be then 7.5)<br />
<br />
<br />
|Subjective review| (SPOILER alert)<br />
My relationship with this anime was like a love&amp;hate relationship. While i enjoyed the tournament, i wanted to see Hinata and Kagami fly and compete so bad. And when they teased it at the end of episode 10 i was so hyped. And then they just skipped it... We only saw both of them fly for like 10 seconds in the whole series. I felt for Misaki (couldn&#039;t care less for Asuka)<br />
and was kinda disappointed by how they finished her story line. But yes, wasn&#039;t so bad but i definitely was frustrated with quite some parts personally.

    I found Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm strangely intriguing as I watched everything unfold. It really turned into a sports anime of sorts as all the action focused around their sport of choice FC or Flying Circus. Flying circus is about people dog fighting with these special gravity shoes that allow people to fly around at high speeds. <br />
<br />
I think people will like the anime due to peoples fascination with flying around. And these people can surely zip around. Even tho it does take a second to get rolling into the main action. I found myself enjoying it. Give it a chance and it

    This series is rated lower than it deserves partly because many have judged the anime too quickly and dropped it since. Also, due to this, there are many lowly rated reviews for this anime. However, I&#039;ll be delivering my take on this anime.<br />
<br />
Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm - The REAL Proper Review <br />
<br />
Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm is an anime that could have had the potential to be a really great anime but was plagued by its origin. &quot;Eroge&quot; &amp; &quot;Visual Novel&quot; Lets take a deeper look why it meets its demise when compared other animes of the season.<br />
<br />
Most anime are adapted &amp;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review215202">
        serialized from its manga counterpart. Manga are usually known &amp; recognized for its deep plot/content. Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm on the other hand is adapted from its visual novel known for its eroge. Most visual novels serving its &quot;eroge&quot; purposes have little to no real plot by default. Furthermore, its &quot;sports&quot; focus further reduce its chances for any deep plot to come by.<br />
<br />
However with Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm, I think they have done pretty well despite being a &quot;sports&quot; anime. It&#039;s actually deeper than it seems and gets better at later episodes. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story - 7/10 <br />
<br />
Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm revolves around a sports called &quot;Flying Circus&quot; The goal of the sports, by flying through the use of Grav shoes, is to score points by touching its buoys in sequence &quot;1,2,3,4&quot; or scoring a hit on the opponent&#039;s back. Or so it seems... This is when the real plot begins to surface. <br />
<br />
Do not JUDGE its plot before Episode 7, because that&#039;s where it really showed how deep it really is.<br />
<br />
When you love &amp; know something so well, for example in a game, (In this case, FC) then all of a sudden, someone new just came &amp; destroyed your concept of that. You become afraid, because the very thing you are so familiar &amp; close to, becomes something you no longer understand. <br />
<br />
That&#039;s what Misaki felt. FC became something &quot;dark&quot;.<br />
<br />
All these while, FC to her, was about touching buoy or hitting each other&#039;s back. A simple and fun sport. But Inui broke that concept. Instead of playing the game, she intensely pressures the opponent by restricting &amp; denying whatever her opponent tries to do. It becomes a mental sports and makes you feel inferior &amp; powerless. That&#039;s the &quot;beauty&quot; Inui and Saki sought. However, Asuka, being that carefree girl, may not fully understand the &quot;dark&quot; Misaki began to see. To Asuka, it is an exciting new territory of the game. But Misaki became afraid of FC, became afraid of Asuka. She could not accept how Asuka could think that way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art - 8/10<br />
<br />
Brilliant &amp; Radiant. This anime is just beautiful to look at. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound - 9/10 <br />
<br />
One of the best anime&#039;s OST I&#039;ve heard in a while. If you actually listen closely, you will notice. One example I can give is in Episode 6. <br />
<br />
Listen closely to the OST:<br />
05:04 to 06:02. <br />
16:22 to 17:47.<br />
17:47 to 19:45.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character - 7/10<br />
<br />
I love the contrast between Asuka and Misaki&#039;s mindset. As I&#039;ve explained earlier. <br />
<br />
Masaya Hinata is your secretive hidden ace badass. He is shown to be rather highly intelligent.<br />
Asuka Kurashina is your slightly clueless clumsy cute female MC with innate potential in FC that she doesn&#039;t really know about.<br />
Misaki Tobisawai is strong female character that is also smart. Realizing the &quot;dark&quot; in FC.<br />
Mashiro Arisaka is your kawaii little loli with cute obsession with Misaki.<br />
Aoi Kagami is your ultimate hidden ace triumph card that you hope she would just come out and whoop everyone&#039;s ass. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 7/10<br />
<br />
I really like all the characters. There&#039;s a good variety in personalities and good comedy. I like seeing Asuka&#039;s sillyness, Mashiro&#039;s cute obsession with Misaki. Hinata &amp; Kagami being the hidden badass retired aces.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall - 7/10 <br />
<br />
Honestly, I really enjoyed this anime despite being poorly received by the community. A good mix of comedy, action with its beautiful art, amazing OSTs. Would definitely recommend to give this series a try and watch till the very end.

    Short review.<br />
<br />
Cookiezi brought me to this anime, so i couldnt resist watching it. <br />
<br />
From the start to beginning I was thrilled, not to mention that they literally got me with the feeling, that flying can be something beautiful and this Anime makes it look more fun and more thrilling. <br />
<br />
The Story was  the worst part of the anime. It was very fast paced and many plotholes or even many important part, that would have make the story more exciting weren&#039;t animated. You dont get the feeling of something interesting and watch it merely because you somehow enjoy it how awesome it looks how they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214596">
        fly and how the principle of &quot;their&quot; flying is. <br />
<br />
The music was fine, nothing special or from heaven door, but atleast you can say that this was enough to make it an enjoyable anime. <br />
<br />
You have too many characters to develop, yet only 12 episodes to animate. It&#039;s sad, since it could have been one of the top 150 contenders with a rating with 8~, but the budget was not enough. One the fatal weakpoints from becoming an actual good anime, since it lacks real development plus the  very fast pacing. <br />
<br />
In the End, it is an enjoyable anime and you can watch it with a smile in your face. But dont expect too much from it and do not try to find logical aspects in it. It already stops with &quot;people flying and having a competition in it&quot;. <br />
<br />
7/10

    Stunning artwork, Average plot, great sound, overall an anime worth your time if you&#039;re not too picky. <br />
<br />
Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm revolves around a character who was intrigued with FC(Flying circus). So, she took up the so called sport and the plot pretty much revolves around how she got through all adversities to be an amazing FC player. Extra factors like having a coach who used to be one of the best players but quit due to personal reasons, becoming friends with the Best player of FC and more just adds up the entertaining factor to this anime.<br />
<br />
This anime gives a very upbeat

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214681">
        vibe, vibrant colours and great sound.<br />
To put it simply, it has a simple plot but the visuals and sound make up for the most of it, which makes it pretty much a decent anime for 2016.<br />
<br />
Extras: There&#039;s no romance at all for this anime. The summary is a little bit misleading.<br />
<br />
Cheers!

    I’m not going to waste your time and get to the point. This show is terrible. It gets worse as it goes along and there is nothing here that makes it worth your time. 0/5 and the only reason it’s scored as a 1/5 is because I can’t put a 0/5! There’s nothing redeemable about it, but for clarification’s sake, I’ll explain. Also, no spoiler warning because this show is so bad that you’ll be glad I spoiled it for you.<br />
A little bit of background on the show: it’s an erotic visual novel, but adapted as something that has ALMOST no fanservice. Remember my phrasing,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review215471">
        ALMOST, because it has a big effect on the show. Let’s get into the juicy stuff now.<br />
STORY<br />
Boring, uninspired, predictable. Nothing about this show is refreshing. The premise is boring, the setting is uninspired (school setting), and the plot progression is all over the place. Now, none of these would matter if executed correctly, but they aren’t. The story takes 3 episodes to get started, and another 3 episodes for it to become watchable. It’s essentially a sports anime, but with a sport that they made up. The plot is so predictable that when I predicted where the show would go AT EPISODE 1, it went that exact route. This is the definition of cliché! <br />
A lot of scenes feel like filler with nothing worthwhile happening and is very skippable. It has a slice of life feel, except there is a plot that the show doesn’t like to focus on. When a show doesn’t focus on its own plot, why should the audience? <br />
Fanservice in this show is laughable. This show comes off as a kids show, but as I said, it comes from an erotic visual novel. The only reason some fanservice is left in here is because the creators wanted to get some extra Blu-ray sales. <br />
The setting of the show is at school. You may think that since flying is a huge aspect of the show, skirts would be a very illogical choice of clothing. Except that the girls wear skirts to school, which makes no sense whatsoever. Guys looking up their skirt would be guaranteed and happens in the anime. Furthermore, the design of the costumes for “competitions” are dumb. In a competition about speed, why would you wear baggy clothing? It’d slow you down. Something like spandex would make the most sense because it’s aerodynamic. Also, while in school, characters do moronic things that would otherwise get them expelled from school in real life!<br />
There will be info dumps. A lot of them. Every time something new is shown, you get info dumped on. Everything from “how the shoes work” to “how to fly”. Terrible writing, cheap dialogue, cringy jokes and characters, all bad. The main character has the special power of being amazing instantly and this is never explained. <br />
This seems to be a theme throughout the show. Not showing how things happened. They just expect you to know why something that happens is bad. One of the main conflicts is caused through unrealistic actions and it physically hurts me because of all the questions it brings up.<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
Characters are even more cliché than the story. They all don’t develop and follow the generic route of their archetypes. One of the characters quits, then rejoins through some terrible speech and they somehow win some competition through the power of friendship and cringy dialogue or whatever. They all only have one characteristic that defines them and could be replaced by just about any bland character and no one would be able to tell the difference.<br />
Character interactions are unrealistic and uninspired. They don’t feel like they would ever really happen and what characters say is more forced than terrible puns that people try to make. The main character’s dialogue and voice actor make me stiffen up because of how the dialogue is said. The VA has a squeaky, annoying voice and says “DESU” all the time! It’s annoying and breaks immersion. <br />
The other characters include: the one with the inferiority complex, the one that’s obsessed with another character, the obligatory teacher, and the supposedly elusive character. You’ll find out who’s who by the end of episode one. The one with the inferiority complex is the one that quits and will rejoin because the plot needs them to.<br />
Within two episodes, characters have a better relationship than I do with people I’ve known for 3 years, which would never happen. Interactions that would hurt these relationships have no effect like when the main male character gets to see the main female character naked TWICE because sales, stupidity on the characters part, and plot convenience. <br />
It’s absurd that this much trash gets pushed through to a general audience each season. Anything else I say would be rambling and I feel like I’ve asserted my points and explained them well. <br />
SOUND<br />
This is the super subjective part because everyone’s tastes in the sound department differs more than any other department. Like I said, I have the voice actors. They ruin the immersion of the show because of how annoying their voices are. They are all squeaky and over the top. They only help to reinforce the terrible dialogue by making it worse.<br />
The music is goes from forgettable to ear wrenchingly annoying. Sometimes I have to turn off all sound because I think it’s so bad. The OP and ED don’t bring someone into this show’s world and seem lazy. There’s literally nothing else to say.<br />
ANIMATION<br />
This department is despicable. From moe to way too noticeable 3d cgi, this show uses all the worst art styles in the book. It takes skill to make animation look bad in this day and age, but this show did it without skipping a beat. <br />
The character’s eyes keep moving on their faces as they talk, showing the inconsistencies with the animation. Their eyes are also always either too far apart or too close together. The 3d cg is noticeable for the “competition” scenes as they are used to save budget on animation and it still couldn’t make the normal animation look good. The show switches back and forth because it shows the characters in 2d while they talk and in 3d while they are flying in these “competitions”. My final piece of evidence as to why this show is terrible!<br />
FINAL VERDICT<br />
As I said in the beginning, the show is a 0/5. There’s nothing good about it and going to sleep early would be more productive than wasting 3-4 hours watching this. If you want a GOOD sports anime, watch Baby Steps. Although it also has a low animation budget, it doesn’t shoehorn in 3d cg for the main characters during their competition scenes and the important scenes are animated exceptionally well. That’s all I have to say. Don’t support this garbage and I hope you don’t give this a rating above a 2/5!<br />

    I watched the first episode and I was absolutely hooked!!!! This anime is one of the best animes I have ever watched! The character development is really good, and the supporting characters get more screen time then other animes. The main characters are so cute, and the plot line is fun, enticing, and suspenseful!<br />
<br />
* A Small Synopsis * <br />

    This is my first review on Internet so I hope I write this well.<br />
<br />
Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm is a awesome piece of work made by sprite and ruined by those who animated it. Only the people who actually played this godly game can understand this frustration.<br />
The Story is about Asuka, a girl who moved to Kunashima due to her father&#039;s transfer and later comes across a sports called &quot;Flying Circus&quot; which uses GraShuu (A type of shoes which uses anti-graviton particle to make you fly) and then joins the &quot;Kunahama FC Club&quot; together with a classmate and a kouhai.<br />
<br />
Story 6/10. The Story presented

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214750">
        in the anime is completely different from how it really is. Getting from beginning, It was just Masaya alone who finds Asuka searching for her house keys. Also, it was him alone who uses the co-op system of the shoes to help Asuka get to the school on time. The terminal which is shown outside the school, is actually inside the building. (So if someone uses the Grashuu then he/she doesn&#039;t have to go all the way to cross the main gate). Misaki actually meets Asuka for the first time in the classroom. Masaya never knew that Mashiro family runs the Udon Shop untill Mashiro injures herself during the practice. It was Masaya alone Aoi-sensei asks to be the instructor for her flying lessons. Also It was just Masaya and Asuka who finds Satouin-san and Shion-senpai having an argument over the &quot;in&quot; letter plus Masaya actually doesn&#039;t see Asuka do the &quot;Air Kick Turn&quot; for the first time, as he closes his eyes not able to see her figure falling into the sea after the fail attempt to target Satouin -san&#039;s back, also it was Satoiun-san herself who explain about FC to Asuka. After the match Buchou bugs Masaya for like a week or so to join the club, and in the end, getting asked by sensei and convinced by asuka he finally decides to join the club. Also it was not Madoka but Masaya who takes the three of them to the Shirase-san&#039;s FC Shop. Though the story of the &quot;Anime Adaptation&quot; deserves 2, I gave it 6 just because it takes few points, just a few points from the original series.<br />
<br />
Art 6/10 - As expected of the art of these days anime&#039;s. It&#039;s well made. I have nothing to say about that.<br />
<br />
Sound 7/10 - As the &quot;anime adaptation&quot; mixed few BGM from the VN, it&#039;s quite good to the ears. Plus the OP/ED are made quite well as well (Not as good as the VN&#039;s though)<br />
<br />
Character 6/10 - Aside Masaya, how they portrayed the characters in the anime are pretty much how they&#039;re like in the VN.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 2/10 - Just after watching the first two episodes of the anime, I raised the white flag, as I didn&#039;t wanted the headache I got from those two episodes to effect the surroundings.<br />
<br />
Overall 4/10 - I do know that the visual novel and light novels adaptations are pretty much like that and I don&#039;t wanna see the rest of the 10 episodes to prove that. <br />
A piece of advice, if you know how to read Japanese then please play the game, I ensure you that it&#039;s 500 times better than the anime, but if you don&#039;t know how to read, then just wait for the English Translation to finish and then try it.

    &gt;&gt; My review may contain a few spoilers, you&#039;re being warned &lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm is an anime series (a shame that the light novel takes quite a bit of time to be translated though) I find original in various elements. <br />
Unlike some other one-sided gender sports anime (such as Haikyuu!, Kuroko no Basket...), Ao no Kanata&#039;s Flying Circus&#039; point of view tend to be focused in a mixed gender. If you have read/watched Air Gear, you can say it&#039;s a more traditional version of Air Trek, in a duel fashion, with the wings of freedom still remaining at your feet.<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
<br />
Well, more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review217343">
        arcs/episodes would have been appreciated for me, but I don&#039;t have the right to blame too much about it since it&#039;s based on a visual novel and as such, have to be faithful to it in the different adaptations. <br />
Apart from that, the male protagonist, Masaya, is a retired FC pro player, coaching his friends of Kunahama high, after the latter were captivated from witnessing the FC sport. The realism of how this story progresses by excluding luck and unreal miracles, makes it different from what I used to watch in other sports themed anime.<br />
In spite of that, it&#039;s a pity that the show doesn&#039;t show FC at a wider scale.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
<br />
The scenery, background and images are quite colourful, filled with light colours (mostly at least). The liveliness and attractiveness of the anime&#039;s sport is clearly underlined by the coloured trails left by the Grav-Shoes as well. You can say it&#039;s a kind of art which is manifesting under diverse forms, depending on someone&#039;s style, on top of being a sport. In a way, this aestheticism kind of mesmerize you (it does for me at least).<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
<br />
The anime has a pretty relaxing, light opening, the same goes for the soundtrack, with some trying to underline the more intense atmosphere of major, skilled matches. Maybe, it&#039;s too soft and not enough pumped up, but who would want to disrupt the good and calm breeze anyway? It has its own and exotic wind enveloping and welcoming us.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8/10<br />
<br />
That being said, 13 episodes seem a bit short to show a certain, detailed development within the characters, but after fully watching it, that is not really the case. Each one of them has an inspiration to chase after, a good reason enough to light up a flame within them to boost them (Kazunari Shindo, Inui Saki...). Other than that, they make the anime fun and great to watch.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
<br />
I truly liked watching the anime, too bad it is ephemeral because of a few episodes (sadly). A sequel would be quite neat, if it can remain all of the aspects of this one (or improve the plot&#039;s scale).<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
<br />
It is a short but nonetheless great anime to watch, with a mixing between a thaw and tense soundtracks in their respective moments, as well as mesmerizing graphics/images at some point.

    Since this anime was one of the highlights of the animes I&#039;ve watched this season, I guess it would be right to write a review.<br />
<br />
Even though the story used common characters (air head, childhood friend?) and the story was predictable, it was quite fun to watch in my perspective. The progression of the protagonists was always interesting to see and there were definitely some surprises for me while I watched the anime. You can definitely tell it&#039;s a sport anime while watching but it sometimes just lacks the seriousness that&#039;s usually expected. Whilst not the best art style I&#039;ve ever seen, it looked quite nice

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214660">
        and I enjoyed watching how the FC matches went.<br />
<br />
Nice anime overall.

    I know this is kinda weird review (and probably the shortest one available), but still... (sry for my English :(<br />
<br />
tl;dr: highly recommended if you&#039;re looking for an anime to stay live in.<br />
<br />
I watched the anime about 2 years ago and gave it 6/10 because the plot was really mediocre but... somehow i play this opening song again and again. Now I understand: this anime isn&#039;t about the breathcatching plot or the awesom characters, it&#039;s just about the atmosphere and surroundings. When I watched it for the first time, it was just an average anime to me, but it left kind of subconscious imprint on my

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327760">
        soul. I realised it for the first time, as these green rainy urbanized islands appeared in my dreams. As I woke up, I just understood, that there&#039;s something special about this atmosphere and this landscape. Since that, I&#039;m just in love with that atmosphere. &quot;Lange Rede, kurzer Sinn&quot;, as we say in Germany, but I wish I could live in this city with all its rains, winds and this grey beautiful rainy sky.

    &#039;&#039;True battle comes after losing.&#039;&#039; (Spoilers)<br />
<br />
When I first watched the first episode I thought &#039;&#039;Wow, that was interesting and pretty bad at the same time. But just try not to drop it.&#039;&#039; I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t. This anime covered its bad parts and has become a lot better since the first episode. But still it has issues. They added drama and character developments in it but still with romance, better art and exciting music it could even deserve 9 out of 10. <br />
<br />
Story: 7.5/10<br />
<br />
The story is about a girl who always wanted to fly, luckily there is a invention that makes people fly : Flying

          <span style="display: none;" id="review215194">
        Shoes. That girl moves to an island(?) and starts using that shoes. But she can&#039;t fly well so her new friends start teaching her how to fly. Her dreams came true! What a happy story... Anyway, the main plot is about an interesting sport called Flying Circus (FC) and she starts being into it (long story... Watch the first episode and you&#039;ll understand). Then she and her friends start doing FC, the male character becomes their coach/director and they want to go to tournaments. Yeah story is going like that. Actually what matters about the story is matches. Who is going to win and what kind of cool moves and strategies is s/he going to use? <br />
I don&#039;t like the characters that so OP and wins every match from ep 1 to final, so this anime is not like that. In the first episode main character couldn&#039;t even fly stable. My only hope from the story was that (characters improve their skills) and it happened. And I liked the final. And they expressed their main idea well in the final. &#039;&#039;True battle comes after losing.&#039;&#039; (Well, a lot of losing) and you should have fun while you are trying to win.<br />
The plot is classic sport or slice of life plot and it&#039;s interesting enough to continue so 7/10 is a fair score.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
<br />
I generally didn&#039;t like the character designs but the match scenes and flying effects are really cool.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t like the OP or ED so much but OSTs are actually good and relaxing.<br />
<br />
Characters: 7/10<br />
<br />
These kind of animes characters and enjoyment is much more important than story. &#039;&#039;But the characters are the worst part of this anime. They should&#039;ve made the characters interesting. Even better art (character designs) would make them more interesting.&#039;&#039; I said when I first wrote this review. I still think it is one of the worst parts of this anime but when I kept watching I found the characters really interesting. They tried all characters to develop (which I liked) but it could be a lot better. Few episodes, the main focus was on the characters but not matches. We saw Misaki&#039;s real feels about the FC, Asuka and the &#039;&#039;FC King&#039;&#039;. And Asuka was one of the most developed characters I&#039;ve seen. The episode when she fell into the sea and she lost and she cried. Maybe the only time this anime used drama but it was good. The main problem is the male character. He is just directing the girls. 2 or 3 minutes we saw him flying but it surely wasn&#039;t enough. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
<br />
At first it&#039;s really boring but I started to enjoy it after mid-season. Generally the match scenes are really enjoyable. You usually know who&#039;s gonna win but the tricks are really cool. But the main problem about the enjoyment is lack of comedy and especially romance. <br />
<br />
Overall: 7/10<br />
<br />
So here is my opinions about this series. Could be a lot better? Hell, yes. Is it bad? Hell, no :)

    Ao No Kanata No Four Rhythm was adapted from a VN so before the show aired, most people (including me) all assumed that there would be romance in this show. Turns out Studio Gonzo decided to go the different path by choosing the slice-of-life path. This caused some -- if not -- most people to dislike the show but not me. I thought this was an average relaxing slice-of-life show and that&#039;s it. <br />
<br />
<br />
[Story]: (7/10)<br />
In a world where flying is as simple as riding a bicycle, Four Rhythm Across the Blue is set in a world where people can take to the skies by using

          <span style="display: none;" id="review216593">
        a technology called &quot;Grav-shoes&quot; which allows the wearer to fly to the skies.  Aside from simple transportation, people also use these shoes in a competition called FC (Flying Circus). To score points, they either touch buoys floating above the ocean, or their opponent&#039;s backs. <br />
<br />
I was really hyped for this series when I first heard about it back in October of last year. I was like &quot;Flying Circus?, Drama and Romance?! Hell yeah, I&#039;m watching this series&quot;. It was my most anticipated series of Winter 2016. Fast forward to January when the show started airing, my hype slowly died down after the 3rd or so episode. What slowly killed the hype for me? Lack of romance. If I wasn&#039;t expecting Romance in the beginning then I would have probably enjoyed this show a lot more I did right now. <br />
<br />
There wasn&#039;t really anything interesting that occurred in the first half in terms of story. It&#039;s basically just an introduction to the characters, how the Flying Circus works which is surprisingly more complex than I thought it would be and a few Flying Circus matches which is so fun to watch because there was barely any still shots and it&#039;s all smooth and consistent. I want to talk more about the FC&#039;s rules. At first, I thought it would just be a simple race or touching the opponent&#039;s back to score a point but turns out there&#039;s more rules embedded in FC. It actually wasn&#039;t until the 2nd half where I completely understood how FC works. You know, just like Basketball. Simple yet somewhat complex if you&#039;re a beginner. <br />
<br />
Now, the 2nd half, where the actual story begins. I wouldn&#039;t say the 2nd half is where the show redeemed itself but I can say that it&#039;s better than the first half. Basically, the 2nd half focuses on a certain someone introducing a new play style to FC which is honestly a dick move except it&#039;s a smart strategy Remember when Basketball didn&#039;t have those 24 second shot clock? That&#039;s how I&#039;ll explain the new play style. Since this is a non-spoiler review, I won&#039;t explain it in detail. Even with the new &quot;innovative&quot; play style introduced, it shows us how Asuka will never give up on FC and how she&#039;s still going to have fun playing FC<br />
<br />
Last thing that I want to talk about is the comedy. The way they handled the show&#039;s comedy is horrible. Four Rhythm&#039;s comedy is a hit or miss and for the most part, it&#039;s a miss. There are a few hits though but like I said, the miss outweighs the amount of hits. For example, whenever Asuka show&#039;s her ditzy/clumsy side; instead of me laughing, I was annoyed. By the way, this is coming from a guy who has a thing for ditzy female characters. I think they&#039;re funny but there was something about Asuka&#039;s ditziness that didn&#039;t translate into &quot;hahaha&quot; but rather, into &quot;agh, her annoying side&quot;. <br />
<br />
If the show is going to have a second season then it&#039;s immediately going into my watch list because the final episode is the best episode that I have ever seen in Four Rhythm. Thought, it&#039;s a shame because it wasn&#039;t enough to save this series. The dogfight scene was just so amazing and Asuka&#039;s determination is one of the best that I&#039;ve seen from her. Asuka was so close to being my favourite character in the series but that spot goes to someone else. <br />
______________________________________________________________<br />
[Art/Animation]: (10/10)<br />
The Animation is simply beautiful. It completely fits with wherever the show is set and it looks so relaxing. It looks like they live in an island to me. The character designs are also amazing and if you look at the cover, you&#039;ll see Asuka&#039;s side boob. Yea..you&#039;ll see more of them side boobs in the 2nd half of the series. I already said this above and I&#039;ll say it again. The Dogfighting scenes are great..They&#039;re just so engaging and once a match ends, you&#039;ll want to watch more Flying Circus matches. There&#039;s also barely any still shots which makes the matches more exciting to watch. <br />
______________________________________________________________<br />
[Sound]: (9/10)<br />
When I first heard the soundtrack that was playing in the PV, I knew that the show&#039;s soundtrack will be great and I guess I was right. The Dogfighting battle themes is where the soundtrack excels and every time I hear it, it gives me goosebumps and it makes the matches more exciting to watch. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)<br />
<br />
The OP theme song is &quot;Contrail ~Kiseki~&quot; by Mami Kawada and the ED theme songs are &quot;a-gain&quot; by Ray  and &quot;Kimi Toita Sora&quot; by Ray. I love Mami Kawada but I feel like this is, by far, her weakest song. It&#039;s not a bad song or anything and I didn&#039;t hate it but compared to her other songs, this is her weakest song. Four Rhythm&#039;s (VN version) OP &quot;Wings of Courage&quot;, which was also sung by Mami Kawada, is 10 times better. Though, I&#039;m glad they played &quot;Wings of Courage&quot; in the final episode during the final FC match. For the ED, Ray delivers again with her beautiful singing voice. If you&#039;ve heard her previous songs then the ED theme song should sound similar to Nagi no Asuka&#039;s OP and Ano Natsu De Matteru OVA&#039;s OP.  <br />
______________________________________________________________<br />
[Characters]: (7.5/10)<br />
Take a look at the character&#039;s list and guess who the main character of the series is. If you think it&#039;s Masaya Hinata then you&#039;re dead wrong because he&#039;s basically a non-existent main character. He didn&#039;t have any serious role in the series other than training Asuka how to fly. Hell, he &quot;didn&#039;t&quot; even fly nor did he participate in any of the FC matches. He feels more like a side character to me. Though, they did explain in the show why Masaya doesn&#039;t participate in the FC anymore but it still bothered me that he&#039;s the supposed main character but all he was doing is coaching Asuka. If the series were to get a second season and Masaya flies again because Asuka inspired him to play in FC again then I will forgive Masaya&#039;s non-existent MC role here. <br />
<br />
The character that felt like an actual Main Character is Asuka Kurashina. Not only does she get more character development than Masaya but she also gets more screentime than Masaya. Honestly, I love Asuka&#039;s character because of her passion in FC and her determination to never give up. Due to her determination, she manages to do (and master) a special move that is supposedly hard to do. At the first half, she&#039;s a ditzy, clumsy character who barely knows how to fly but in the second half, she&#039;s more of a strong female character who chased her passion and never gave up on FC even though she was horrible at flying. In the second half, she manages not only to fly but also master the special move. <br />
<br />
The 2nd character that also felt like an actual MC than Masaya is Misaki Tobisawa. At first, I honestly did not like her because of her cliched personality. She loves to sleep and eat and the fact that she puts a &quot;nya&quot; at the end of her sentences is the sole reason why I didn&#039;t like her in the first half. However, in the 2nd half, I began to like her character and she became my most favourite character in the series. It&#039;s mostly because of her character development in the 2nd half. <br />
______________________________________________________________  <br />
[Enjoyment]: (7.8/10)<br />
Even though the show suffers from lack of romance and there&#039;s minimal drama in the series, I still enjoyed the series because of the FC matches and Asuka and Misaki&#039;s character in the 2nd half which was a lot better when they were first introduced.  <br />
______________________________________________________________<br />
[VERDICT]<br />
&quot;Ao No Kanata No Four Rhythm&quot; or &quot;Four Rhythm Across the Blue&quot; in English could have been something great if they stuck with the VN and made this series a 2 cour but instead what we got is an average/decent slice-of-life show about Flying Circus. If you&#039;re looking for a relaxing slice-of-life show that focuses on a fictional sport then this is for you. If you&#039;re looking for romance however, then I don&#039;t recommend this anime. You&#039;re better off playing the Visual Novel.    <br />
<br />
[OVERALL]: (7.5/10)<br />
<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
+Relaxing Slice of Life show that&#039;s about a fictional sport<br />
+FC matches are exciting to watch<br />
+Outstanding Animation<br />
+Great Soundtrack, most of it are battle themes that plays during FC<br />
+Asuka&#039;s determination and passion in FC is what makes her a likable character<br />
+Great and Exciting Ending<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
-Gonzo deciding not to adapt the romance element from the source material.<br />
-Comedy is mostly a miss<br />
-Asuka&#039;s personality was annoying for the first 3-4 episodes

    In an alternate world anti-gravity shoes are commonplace worldwide that allows the user to fly around in the sky practically. Thus came the creation of a game called ‘Flying Circus’ Asuka Kurashina is a transfer student who has no idea about anti-gravity shoes. After being introduced to the anti-gravity shoes and the sport ‘Flying Circus’ by Hinata Masaya and Misaki Tobisawa, Asuka then decides to join the ‘Flying Circus’ club bringing about its revival. <br />
<br />
Now I’ll be the first to admit it, I didn’t think this anime was going to go anywhere and the subject of flying was going to be a small plot point

          <span style="display: none;" id="review216213">
        whilst the series focusses on the romance aspects and such. Boy… was I wrong. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story: <br />
The story focusses on our main heroine Asuka Kurashina and her progression in the Flying circus team and we have the inclusion of other characters from Kunahama academy and their progression within the sport. <br />
<br />
Initially the show starts off in what I perceived to be a stereotypical romance/harem anime. Asuka meets Hinata on the beach and helps her out. The anime however decides not to take the romantic route and focusses entirely on the sports aspect of the anime. <br />
<br />
Story progression was steady throughout the show and I only feel that the rushed ending was the let-down for me. However what surprised me was that the show made me feel that some romantic elements were going to be included, but shifted focus away from what was in the visual novel, which in my opinion was a fantastic call. <br />
<br />
Romance elements can distract the story of an anime unless that is the central theme. However being a sports anime the focus was entirely on the development of their skills and the determination of the characters to fight for the sport that they love. <br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: <br />
Asuka Kurashina is a ditsy and adorable girl who had aspirations of soaring through the skies as a child. When introduced to grav-shoes, Asuka initially struggles to use them and with the assistance of Hinata and Misaki, Asuka learns how to fly properly and after being persuaded to join the flying circus club Asuka’s skills in flying and as an all-rounder player excel greatly. Asuka’s relationships with other members in the group is solid and especially with Misaki which I will delve into. <br />
<br />
Misaki Tobisawa is a stern and energetic girl who is personally my favourite character in the show. It was after introducing Asuka to flying circus that Misaki would try competing in the sport again. I felt Misaki’s development as a character was really tested after being beaten Kazunari Shindō. I really loved how the show goes about portraying the change in desire after losing to someone else and witnessing someone else better than you. <br />
<br />
The last mentionable character is Hinata Masaya who is the coach of the flying circus team. Hinata acts as a mentor for Asuka and the others to help improve their game. Masaya is a lesser character in the anime in comparison to being the main protagonist of the visual novel.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: <br />
Studio Gonzo does yet again a great job of animating this series, the use of 3D was apparent in some episodes, but I didn’t find it particularly distracting. Colours were vibrant, but character designs were nothing special if I’m honest. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
The sound was very good for the series. I haven’t listened to the OST yet, but particularly during the flying circus matches It was heavy with excitement and anticipation. The sound tracks did a good job to get me invested in the intense sports battles. &quot;A-gain&quot; by Ray was an excellent ending song for the anime and accompanied by the visuals of Asuka and Misaki highlighting the two’s close friendship and rivalry made it very enjoyable. <br />
<br />
<br />
Final Verdict:<br />
I was quite sure this anime would end up being another stereotypical adaptation of a romance visual novel and I was honestly quite surprised with the final product. Let’s get this straight Aokana is a sports anime, something I didn’t realize since old reliable Wikipedia branded It as a romance. When stripped away of its romantic elements you do have yourself an enjoyable show to watch. That doesn’t however mean it’s a justifiable show to recommend. <br />
<br />
The anime started off quite slow actually. I also felt that there are a lot of other sports anime out there that could do equally as much justice as Aokana did, but just a difference in sports. I can see how the appeal of flying through the skies can make can the show an attractive proposition and to integrate a sport into this was a very good idea, to which I give the Reiko Yoshida applause. <br />
<br />
The silly moments provided comedic relief weren’t anything too amusing and at times Misaki’s use of cat speech like ‘Nya’ can be annoying, though I&#039;m just nit-picking the little things.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall I found this Aokana to be a very nice show about competitive flying sports. I recommend this to fans of sports anime looking for alternative sports to basketball or tennis.  Those looking for romance elements won’t find any here, so scoot along. <br />
<br />
I give Aokana a 7 out of 10 and a recommendation of trying the first four episodes. If you don’t like it then move on to something else after that. <br />
<br />
Alternative recommendations for this are Ro-Kyu-Bu! A basketball anime with cutesy girls who aim to become better basketball players… Yeah... Sorry guys I don’t watch a lot of sports anime can’t find much else to compare this to if im honest. <br />
<br />
Lastly I suggest trying a visual novel called. ‘If my heart had wings’ vastly different in terms of story as a group of highschoolers set out building a glider to soar through the open skies. It came to mind when i watched Aokana. If you like visual novels check it out. <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading guys. Have a nice day!<br />

    So, Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm is about a sport called FC- Flying Circus is where 2 players, 1 vs 1 fight in the air at high speed, and gain points by touching buoys that are scattered in the air or by touching the enemy&#039;s back.<br />
<br />
Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm is a special anime, I have yet to see a speical like this.<br />
The sports focus also gives the satisfaction as it was Action, even though it doesn&#039;t have action is it.<br />
Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm doesn&#039;t have any nudity, Ecchi or sexual moments, also called &quot;Fanservice&quot;- None.<br />
<br />
It focuses on the FC itself,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review215365">
        and less on the side, which is great, and can make the plot go on smoothly and well.<br />
The story didn&#039;t have much of complication, it was basically their training, development, matches and tournaments, which were exciting matches, colorful and bright.<br />
I don&#039;t remember the sound being something special, the Opening song was pretty catchy and fun to hear, but nothing else.<br />
<br />
Characters develpoed there well, they had the times which they were at their best, and a bit when they weren&#039;t, but most of the anime was in a good spirit.<br />
Also, the characters were really funny, and got well together (Some anime has the inside fights in a group, this anime doesn&#039;t really have that, besides a small time when they envyed each other).<br />
<br />
The &quot;bad&quot; charaters weren&#039;t &quot;evil&quot; or so, they were pretty fine, and understandble, and people can also like them.<br />
<br />
This anime is absolutely underrated, and I enjoyed watching that very much, It&#039;s light, and goes with a free spirit (No depressing or &quot;feelings&quot; scenes)<br />
*In addition, no romance*<br />
<br />
I rated everything 8/10- Story, Art, Sound, Character and Enjoyment.<br />
In short, special anime, that you don&#039;t see around every day, and is recommended. Fits to everybody. :)
