    Since Rewrite is a visual novel by Key, a lot of people will compare it to the likes of Clannad, Angel Beats, Air Cannons, etc. But, I propose some new comparisons.<br />
<br />
1. Shitcom, because both are pretty shit comedies.<br />
2. The sensation of hitting your head against a brick wall for six hours.<br />

If you enjoy either of these, then Rewrite might be the perfect show for you. Otherwise, I consider it one of the worst anime of 2016: a fucky jambalaya of overdesigned characters, dumb memes, and a plot that was probably written by someone putting a bunch of sticky notes on a dartboard and writing in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230027">
        whatever they threw at.<br />
<br />
Before I go on, let me just say that I don’t give a flying fuck about how good the visual novel is or isn’t. I don’t care what purpose this anime serves to it, whether to be some sort of adaptation, if you can even call it that, or just a teaser meant to advertise it, whatever. I’m just reviewing the anime the same way I review any other anime: like a little dickbag who isn’t good at anything els--I mean, independent of any other source material. I did not at all write a Shokugeki review comparing it to the manga to contradict myself and then delete it out of embarrassment.<br />
<br />
So if you’re not very familiar with Key’s works, here’s how they generally go: The MC is an everyday normal guy with just enough wit to keep him from being 100% beta, but not enough substance to put him above the level of a general self-insert. He goes to a weird school filled with even weirder people (mostly overly-designed cutesy girls) with some maddeningly strange characteristics. Various shenanigans occur for a few episodes until the plot finally comes in, or maybe there’s one to begin with but doesn’t have much of a focus yet. <br />
<br />
If you can’t tell, I’m not a fan of these Key guys who think it’s funny to put their logo on every coffee can in every episode of every show. The way they tell their stories is very jarring because of their spontaneous, bombastic sense of humor. Half the time, I can’t tell if they’re trying to make a teenage melodrama, or if they’re trying to make a dinnertime cartoon sitcom for dummies. It&#039;s an uncomfortable mixture of both, like ketchup and mac and cheese. Since they like to dick around with their storytelling, things can get rushed and/or confusing in the end.<br />
<br />
These things are increased thousandfold in Rewrite.<br />
<br />
There is no plot in Rewrite. None. It pretends to have one in the second half, but the “twist” being that something is actually happening comes out so half-heartedly that the writers seem disappointed in themselves that they can’t write in as many dank maymays into their show. Instead… eh. There are monsters, eh. People are fighting, eh. The world is gonna die, eh. FEECOF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Whoops, there goes Rewrite being funny again xDDDD!<br />
<br />
Don’t believe me? Here’s part of MAL’s synopsis, albeit fanmade by MAL Rewrite (that joke is funnier than anything else in this show): <br />
&quot;Equipped with the superhuman ability to permanently rewrite any part of his body to multiply his strength or speed, Kotarou is naturally drawn to the supernatural.&quot;<br />
<br />
You know when this Rewrite ability is shown for the first time? Episode fucking four. Not one. Four. And, as usual, the story just reveals it as if it’s the most normal thing in the world. No prior hints for him having this power, no explanation as to how or why he has it, nothing. And that synopsis isn’t even accurate, because it&#039;s not just about increasing strength. At one point, he “rewrites” his body to resist poison. What else can he do? Resist age? Resist death? Become invisible? Triple the size of his dick? You know, that would be a good power to have in a massive waifu war such as Rewrite. I think there was a hugely missed opportunity here.<br />
<br />
Other people have powers too. Just because. And there are shitty CG monsters sometimes. Just because. Eh. It’s all part of the hilariously goofy fun that is the Whatever Club at Whatever High School! <br />
<br />
The real plot towards the end turns out to be some environmental awareness campaign. People are assholes and don’t take care of the planet, so other people need to out-asshole them and activate a thing that will kill everyone so that the planet can live. I don’t know how this is supposed to tie into the main character having the ability to theoretically give himself the neck of Alolan Exeggutor. Maybe there’s a reason somewhere that I missed, but it’s a little hard to follow along when the show tries to adapt every possible waifu route in the game while playing catch-up with the plot because that took forever to come in and now it needs to do 3,000 things at once if it wants to wrap up in time. Except the plot took so long to come in that I lost interest before it even happened. Maybe this show should’ve had a rewrite, eh? Ehhhhhhhhhhhhh???<br />
<br />
And at the end of the day, what did this amount to? A dead end. Literally. The ending is not satisfying, as it’s apparently just one route of many, leading me to wonder what the point of all of this even was. Was it to introduce the characters? Anything could’ve done that within a couple episodes; to say an entire thirteen-episode season can be dedicated to that would be an outright lie. Is it to introduce the setting? Kazamatsuri has basically no focus at all. I know that it’s a big place and kinda environmental-friendly. My fucking bedroom could&#039;ve been a more interesting setting, because at least I have Big Order posters. Is it to explain the conflict of the show? Well, it only took them until at least six episodes for them to reveal that there was any conflict in the first place, so… no. It’s all a bunch of mush, and I’m not quoting whatever that pink sheep dog thing was. It tries to please both visual novel readers and newcomers by adapting the visual novel with an anime-original route that tells a complete story while also introducing a story. I don&#039;t even know what the fuck that means, but it failed at all of it.<br />
<br />
Key should just make their own Nichijou. A show where nothing happens, everything is stupid, and it’s funny as hell. Make something like that to satisfy their own sense of humor, so that maybe they can tell a compelling story and find a way for someone to get attached to its characters beyond humorous interactions. Ha ha, Kagari likes coffee and calls it &quot;feecof&quot;!! What a deep character!!!<br />
As everyone will write in every review for every comedy anime in the world: comedy is subjective. Not everyone is going to love it or get it, so making the characters more like a bunch of running jokes in the midst of a deep melodrama might not be the best idea. When they fed me a character&#039;s sob story, my reaction wasn&#039;t &quot;Oh no, how sad! I&#039;m emotionally invested now!&quot;, it was &quot;Wait, I was supposed to take this seriously?&quot; The usual nonsense that follows a sad moment leads me to believe that I had the right idea.<br />
<br />
I can admit that the show was a little funny at times. It was. There was about… one gag per episode that got a laugh out of me. For about four episodes. Because within those first few episodes, I was still somewhat invested in the show. I thought everything would make sense in the end, that something was gonna happen at any moment that would tie everything together and make me believe the show was actually a work of genius. But then it never happened, and even still I was trapped, because I was at a point where I was in too far to pull out and cut my losses. I needed to see it to the end, so I could at least splash more salt than Arataka Reigen. Perhaps that was the point, just to lure everyone in and keep them thinking that, someday, it’ll all come together and make sense, only for them to post a note at the end saying “lol fuk u idiot”. If so, congrats Rewrite, Key, Studio 8bit, you totally PRANK’D me bro!! XDDDDDdddeDdDdrefzdfxff<br />
<br />
Ah, it’s like someone probably once said, a good piece of entertainment is one that leaves the viewer thinking. Rewrite leaves me thinking that I should’ve died in that car wreck I had last year. <br />
<br />
I don’t know who the fuck this 8bit studio is, and given the art of this show and that their most popular work is Infinite Stratos, it seems I haven’t missed out on anything. Rewrite looks terrible. Not even because of the mediocre studio, but even designs imported from the visual novel. Who in the name of Lady Gaga designed the school uniforms in this show? What kind of cruel monster would subjugate these poor girls to this kind of torture? They all have to wear these extremely overdesigned, uncomfortable-looking dresses with skirts and sleeves that you could drive a truck into despite the torso clinging to their tits like a wet washcloth. Isn’t that nice? No, they don’t look cute in the slightest, they look like they take a half-hour to actually put on. And I’m sorry to disappoint everyone, but I’m not really into fucking the wrappers of strawberry-and-creme hard candies. But, whatever fetish you relish.<br />
<br />
The animation is mediocre, which for the most part isn’t a problem, but for some reason the anime becomes an action series with a bunch of fights, and then it’s a problem. Even worse is that there are a bunch of weird supernatural beasts in the second half of the show, and while they have an interestingly jaded color scheme, they’re done in really poor CG. At other times, it’s inconsistent, such as the way they animate Kagari. Do her ribbons move around with a mind of their own, or don’t they? I dunno, I guess whatever key animator 8bit hired for that episode gets to decide that. No particular positives about the art can make up for the big negatives; the only things possibly worth mentioning are that the OP’s and ED’s look surprisingly good, and that maybe the character designs are okay, but as you can expect from a visual novel full of girls, some of them are gonna look strange, like Shizuru and Kotori.<br />
<br />
I guess I should also mention some of the voice acting, because Hana Kanasamanawamallama voiced the main loli girl. Apparently that means it’s good. Not really, because her role didn’t have anything impressive about it, but at least her voice is nice to hear. Otherwise, the soundtrack was decent; it never felt spectacular and most of the time it was pretty average, but there were some good, emotional or light-hearted tracks here and there, especially when (and this is weird to say) Kotaro was about to grope Akane, they played the VN&#039;s OP. Nice. The OP’s and ED’s were all pretty decent as well, though not impressive either.<br />
<br />
Do I need to say anything else? Don&#039;t watch this anime, no matter what sort of relationship you have with the source material. This anime sucks. The story sucks. The idea of it sucks. The way it’s told sucks. The people who are in it suck. Hell, the people that made it probably suck too. Maybe I’ll join Gaia. Not because I care about the planet, but because, sometimes, I just feel that a lot of people dying would fix things. Kefka did nothing wrong. Get well soon, Maeda-san.<br />

    Rewrite, one of Key’s most prominent visual novels getting an anime adaptations? This almost feels surreal, right? I’ll get straight to the point. While the idea of Rewrite finally getting an anime has been a dream for Key fans for many years, it may also be somewhat a tarnished reality as we realize what we’re really getting. After finishing the show, it’s more than just tarnished. Much more.<br />
<br />
On paper, Rewrite follows a lot of standard Key formulas you’ll recognize easily if you’re already familiar with their work. The slow paced story from the beginning, generic character personalities, and supernatural phenomenon are just a few to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230097">
        name. However, one thing this adaptation didn’t fully embrace is its ability to move the audience. What that literally means is its inability to make the viewers feel tearful unlike some other series. (ex. Clannad After Story) Some may question that it would be unfair to compare Rewrite to other Key’s works but in reality, the adaptation really has more humor than it should.<br />
<br />
From the first few episodes, we meet Kotarou Tennouji, the male protagonist. He gets involved with his school’s Occult Club where we meet the other female characters. They range with different personalities and all more or less oddball characters at first. The real catch though is that they are also involved in some kind of darker plot that unfolds as the series progresses. But on paper, the first few episodes doesn’t reveal much of itself as it tries to get viewers to familiarize with the franchise. In essence, the main female characters will likely be a hit or miss to get attached to. Most of them are stereotypes like the school council representative type or the redheaded tsundere. Meanwhile, the series does also introduce a mysterious character from Tennouji’s dream, a young girl with ribbons that seemingly kills him. Perhaps this is where viewers will get intrigued by the show.<br />
<br />
From a standard viewpoint, the storytelling of the series bounces between acceptable and awful. There are some episodes that nails the coffin when it comes to creativity while others makes you feel like it’s a forced chore to finish. As an anime original viewer, I confess that the show itself is underwhelming particular with characters such as Lucia. The way their own story is set up not only feels rushed but lacks concrete feelings. It’s hard to feel what they are going through with the pacing especially from the buildup and ultimately doesn’t really satisfy what its intentions were. On the other hand, some other background storytelling such as with Shizuru (the eye patch girl) feels it’s done right because of the more tragic mood. Still, with the show being just 1-cour, you really shouldn’t expect a full adaptation of each girl’s story. In fact, this particular anime actually develops into a more mysterious plot that unfolds with connecting events. Unfortunately, the insert episodes of the girls’ routes doesn’t do much justice and weighs down the show overall.<br />
<br />
As Rewrite retains a lot of comedy, there’s also the mysteries that carries over the course of the show. I already mentioned about the strange ribbon girl from Tennouji’s dreams. However, we also get the main setting that itself is a mystery. The series takes place Kazamatsuri and has quite a lot of hidden secrets, some that ventures into the supernatural realm. Being the curious guy that he is, Tennouji is drawn to these mysteries as he has a supernatural ability of his own. A major turning point revolves about the utopia-like environment and where all sorts of strange occurrences takes place. When one of the students at Tennouji’s school goes missing, that’s where we realize Rewrite can be darker than it seems. We are also introduced to factions that have conflicts with each other and some of the girls from the Occult Club are involved. Tennouji himself also begins to display inhuman talent with his own Rewrite ability. And finally, we also learn a lot more about the mysterious ribbon girl that appears in Tennouji’s dream. It’ll take patience for viewers to eventually get to the main meat of the plot and if you’re the type that sees Key as an insufferable product, then this will be a hard show to follow.<br />
<br />
Perhaps storytelling isn’t just what Rewrite emphasizes on though. There’s also relationships, connections that tries to be meaningful. Tennouji develops several important relationships with others including Lucia, Kotori, Kagari (the ribbon girl), among others. However, the show itself seems to focus on that mostly on the surface level. Because of time restraints, they aren’t concretely developed as you’ll anticipate. Oh and it’s easy to forget about characters like Haruhiko when his role in the show seems to be mainly comic relief. And romance? That part is mostly teased at and hard to really appreciate if it’s even there. At best, character relationships are subtly memorable but because of the mediocre buildup, they aren’t very memorable.<br />
<br />
Adapted by studio 8-bit, the show itself is underwhelming when it comes to visual quality. The characters look blend while it does retain Key style features such as the moe-eyes, feminine parts, and surreal-like atmosphere. However, the action is more of a disappointment. Well to be honest, the action was never a main attraction in the show anyway and the brief segments where we see that isn’t so appealing either. There’s not much fan service in the show except with the blushing and that one episode where Lucia puts on a maid outfit. Oh yes, a maid outfit.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, soundtrack for Rewrite is impressive. Well, not in the impressive that it’s a masterpiece but definitely hits the key points. The theme songs offers choreography that fits the show quite right while the OST is mysterious as it should be. Even during comedic moments, the music seems to fall in place naturally. Furthermore, character voice expressions are well delivered if you compare to their characters from the VN. <br />
<br />
So in the end, what should you really take for granted from Rewrite? It’s pretty much a popcorn entertainment that’s perhaps only easy to watch if you come with an open mind. For those with high expectations, it’s probably a good idea to drop the show as it seems to appeal to a broader audience, beyond the visual novel fans. I think Rewrite tried to take a risk and although it partially succeeds, there’s more failure. In the end, it’s a nice show to pass time with for fun but not something to talk about for years to come. Oh and season 2 has been announced for the love of God, let’s pray for a better sequel.<br />

    Have a great story and long stories like Key usually get them done, are priceless to see in animation, this one, even with its own factors, it&#039;s one of them...<br />
<br />
The characters are the basis in all stories, and in this one the characters have a great color because each one tell its own story and with that, the story change itself to its true colors.<br />
<br />
The sound and art are nostalgic to the novel, even the 3D sprites, and the usual BGM, so you gonna have a great environment with the luxury of a visual novel material in animation.<br />
<br />
The story, good this animated route, it explain

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230247">
        characters, environments, plot, etc... but for the popular opinion, this is only at the start, when the real problem enter in the play, the anime take a speed of explanation and change of scenes that can make you say: &quot;What I am seeing?! How? What?&quot;, so that was the very weak point with this animation, maybe because the length of the visual novel, this story have so much to say, so transfer this to the animation was unsuccessful at certain grade.<br />
<br />
Even that it&#039;s a story that can be valuated well if you see it with calm, maybe if you get very confused and intrigued, you can awake the feeling to play the visual novel (like me).<br />
<br />
I think this is all, so be patient and play the VN, that a solution, if you reach this point and feel this review useful or only time lost, anyway thanks for read it all, happy anime and happy VNs, remember the other routes will be animated in 2017!!

    Before starting the review I would like to say that I have read most part of the Visual Novel, and I love it, but I will not compare them and I will not argue about the number of episodes, because the review section is supposed to tell about the anime only, and why you should watch or not watch it according to my opinion.<br />
<br />
Rewrite is set in the fictional city Kazamatsuri where treeplanting and afforestation have caused the city to become overgrown with trees and flowers in much the same way that other cities are filled by buildings. Tennouji Kotarou lives here. He&#039;s a high

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230624">
        school student who has the ability to rewrite his own body. He can become stronger and faster at any time he chooses. He investigates supernatural mysteries with five girls from his school.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s the story very simplified, it doesn&#039;t really catch many attention by simply reading the synopsis, despite being much more complex than it seems.<br />
<br />
This anime is an action, comedy, romance and school genre, but why is harem not included here? Refering to the ANIME it really should be a harem genre, a guy staying with five girls in a club, getting along better with each one at each episode. As regards to the action genre I really think they tried to have many action scenes since the very beginning of the anime, which I think was not necessary, because if it followed a slower pace I&#039;m pretty sure it would be way better than that, there&#039;s too many action and too many things happening, I mean, things happen too fast and sometimes you don&#039;t even know anymore what you are watching, I think the word that fits it better is: messy, I also saw many people saying that weren&#039;t understanding anything about the anime. About the Comedy in the anime, it&#039;s funny, not a anime that you will laugh every minute, not even every episode, just because it is not meant to be this way, so I really think it doesn&#039;t lack comedy at all, in other words, in my opinion the comedy was almost used in the right way, there are some scenes where comedy wasn&#039;t necessary, actually, it shouldn&#039;t be there. About the Romance, until now the romance was not very present, it just seems like a generic harem anime, not romantic, even the characters personalities seems like harem.<br />
<br />
The Art of the anime tried to be the most moe as possible, all the girls were supposed to be cute, I don&#039;t think it fits the anime at all, it could be a lot better, but I didn&#039;t found it bad or ugly. It has some CG&#039;s, some of them were well made, but most of them weren&#039;t, I don&#039;t consider it unpleasant, maybe for the majority it can be, also some scenes I feel like the art is a bit bad, but it also has some scenes I found the art pretty, specifically at the beginning of the first episode only, to be honest, as the episodes went by I had the feeling the art worsened.<br />
<br />
About the sound, I think it&#039;s almost perfect, it fits with the scenes and they are very pleasant to hear, OP and ED are beautiful, also 2nd OP and ED are great, Koibumi from Yanagi Nagi and Sunbright by Ayaka Kitazawa are wonderful, I just think the musics were used in the wrong way or timing sometimes, that&#039;s why I wouldn&#039;t give it a 10 score.<br />
<br />
About the characters all of them are pretty funny in their own way, all of them have unique characteristics and personalities, although they seem like the same generic harem type of characters in the beggining, they are pretty well made and show their real selfs at some point.<br />
<br />
I can say I did enjoy it a lot, and also that I didn&#039;t, probably because I read the novel it disappointed me in some points, but it was so enjoyable to see some good scenes being animated, many action scenes, drama, some funny scenes and some romance aspects, although it really feels like just another harem action anime in the beginning. The anime has a fast pace and that&#039;s the bad point here, this &quot;original route&quot; was not bad, the way they adapted it to be a 13 episodes isn&#039;t bad, but the way the story was presented and how rushed it is, this is what makes it bad, also the original route is pretty much a mix of every route in Rewrite in a lighter version, when what&#039;s happening is &quot;too heavy&quot; it seems that they tried to break the ice making a comedy scene right after it, that&#039;s another bad point.<br />
<br />
A new season has already been announced, which I think is great, this entirely season seemed to be rushed and it really was. Anime-only viewers probably disliked it, also some people who read the novel too, they left so many things unexplained, but there&#039;s still hope for this, next season Moon and Terra routes will be adapted, so it will probably be more understandable for everyone and it&#039;s expected to be better adapted too. I&#039;m looking forward for it and I hope everyone feels the same, I mean, this entire season feels like an introduction for the vast and complex story of rewrite, and probably everything will be much more clear after season two, and also depending on how good next season will be, people may change the opinion about this, unfortunately(or not) some people probably just won&#039;t watch next season.

    Sometimes I can&#039;t help but wonder why certain things have to be animated in the first place.<br />
<br />
Already back when it was first announced that Rewrite was going to be adapted, I was getting some very mixed feelings. On one hand I was happy that one of my all-time favorite visual novels was finally getting an anime against my expectations, but on the other hand I also knew that making a good adaptation out of it would be incredibly difficult. This is partially because the visual novel is extraordinarily long and partially because all of its routes directly contradict each other and therefore wouldn&#039;t make much

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230129">
        sense in a linear medium like anime. So it&#039;s fair to say that I came into this with a fair amount of skepticism, especially considering that 8bit were the ones pulling the reigns: the same studio which had already completely destroyed another top rated visual novel two years earlier in Grisaia no Kajitsu.<br />
<br />
And as it turns out, I was right to be skeptical, albeit not quite for the reasons I initially expected. See, the main reason Kajitsu was butchered so hard was because it was unbelievably rushed: they tried to squeeze in a full 80-ish hour visual novel into 13 episodes, and unsurprisingly failed miserably at it, so I was expecting Rewrite to get roughly the same treatment. But as it turns out that wasn&#039;t quite the case, because this time around they decided that instead of trying to adapt an enormous amount of content in an impossibly small time frame, they made an anime original story instead. They tried to circumvent the problem by doing an original arc instead of adapting any of the routes of the game itself, which felt like a bit of a cop-out move to me, but given the circumstances it was probably the best thing they could have done. On paper that is.<br />
<br />
The main problem is, however, that this series doesn&#039;t actually function properly as an original anime. Why? Because if you&#039;re an anime-only viewer, the story makes absolutely no sense. For anyone that hasn&#039;t played the visual novel, you&#039;re most likely going to come out of this anime thinking &quot;wtf just happened&quot; more so than anything else. Basically what they&#039;ve primarily done is taken certain snippets from Rewrite&#039;s various visual novel routes and put them all together into something new, but it just doesn&#039;t work out very well at all. It&#039;s like blindly taking out all the contents of your refrigerator and throwing them into a blender, and hoping that the resulting slurry turns out to be tasty (protip: it probably won&#039;t). There are so many characters that are just thrown into the show with barely any explanation whatsoever, so many plot twists that come across as pulled totally out of nowhere, so many underlying themes and deeper messages that will fly completely over anime-only viewers heads due to lacking proper exposition, and so many supposedly emotional scenes which wholly miss their mark partially because they feel spontaneous and unnatural, and partially because the show does almost nothing to make you empathize with its characters due to how little development they get. Also how they insist on using some of the amazingly beautiful soundtracks from the visual novel for a few such scenes feels almost insulting due to how low the actual emotional impact of the scene itself is compared to where those tracks were originally used in the game... it&#039;s like watching a death scene from Another set to the music of Continued Story: you just don&#039;t.<br />
<br />
Anyway, despite supposedly being an anime original version, it&#039;s still part of the same complex universe that the visual novel routes play out in, and if you&#039;re an anime-only watcher it&#039;ll all be very confusing to watch not only because of how lightning fast the pacing is, but also because of how many scenes are omitted and how much information about the bigger picture of the world itself that you don&#039;t have. As I mentioned earlier, Rewrite is built upon having blatantly contradictory character routes which together create the overarching story as a whole. Everything is connected and part of a much greater picture. So when you&#039;re doing an anime original route instead, you can&#039;t really avoid having to leave a ton of loose ends open. As a result this is barely even watchable as an anime-only viewer, and even if you have played the visual novel it&#039;s still rather inexcusable. Yes, I might understand what is going on a lot more so than most viewers as a result, but it doesn&#039;t change the fact that the entire anime is a huge clusterfuck that doesn&#039;t even come remotely close to the level of the visual novel at any point. It just doesn&#039;t feel satisfying to watch at all, and constantly leaves you hanging with this feeling of &quot;what could have been&quot;.<br />
<br />
There are also certain plot points which are so obviously catered towards people familiar with the source material that they don&#039;t really function properly for those who aren&#039;t. For example, in the beginning of episode 8 there is a minute-long scene of a tiny rock floating through space at high velocity, eventually crashing through Earth&#039;s atmosphere and hitting Kagari right in the head. Evidentially it hit her head pretty badly because from that moment on, her personality makes a full 180, which has a rather drastic impact on the following turns of events. Now if you&#039;ve played the visual novel you should be able to figure out how and why this happened as it&#039;s certainly not anything random, but for an anime-only viewer this plot point is completely absurd. A random tiny asteroid ending up hitting a girl&#039;s head as it crashes onto the planet, forever altering her personality? I mean it&#039;ll look like the most forced plot twist ever made if you don&#039;t know any better. Sure, after the upcoming second season (and yes that was announced at the end of episode 13) they should be able to piece it together as well, but the entire joke of the scene won&#039;t really work retroactively and it&#039;ll still come across as somewhat forced that way. I just can&#039;t help but feel like this is the wrong kind of execution to do when you make an anime original route, because again it pretty much assumes that the viewer has knowledge of latter events which at the current point in time only people who&#039;ve read the visual novel will have. If this Kagari route had been part of the game, it&#039;d probably have been pretty far down on the recommended route order chart; certainly not at the very top at least.<br />
<br />
Now I&#039;ve seen some people argue that 8bit have still done a decent job under the circumstances considering that they had a basically impossible task to begin with, and while I do see what they&#039;re getting at (because let&#039;s face it, making a proper adaptation of Rewrite with this few episodes is a laughable idea regardless of who&#039;s pulling the strings), I can&#039;t really agree on it. While it is true that this anime was more or less doomed before it even started, there were definitely things they could have done a lot better. For example, episodes 4 &amp; 5 were in my opinion a complete waste of time. What I was promised was an anime original story focusing on one of the girls that didn&#039;t have a normal route in the visual novel, Kagari, and nothing more. I wasn&#039;t exactly satisfied with that prospect but I could live with it given the lack of realistic options. But despite that they still insist on spending entire episodes solely on going into the backstories of some of the other heroines in an incredibly rushed manner of fashion that not only felt extremely unsatisfying on their own due to the terrible pacing, but also it has almost nothing to do with the anime original route itself. So why even adapt it? Like you either adapt a route properly or not at all, don&#039;t just throw in abridged versions of them out of nowhere just because you can, geez. In the first place, what&#039;s the point of teasing so much about the other girls when you&#039;re not ever going to follow up on it and properly show the full picture of what the truth behind them is? To tease people into buying the game I guess? Perhaps even more importantly though, by doing this you&#039;re taking away precious screen time that could have actually been spent on developing this original arc you&#039;re so insistent on doing. Like if there&#039;s one thing which you should never end up having pacing issues with, it&#039;s an original anime. I mean the entire scenario script is supposed to be written from scratch specifically to fit the episode count damn it.<br />
<br />
Another thing I found really disappointing is how incredibly casual the anime is about revealing the supernatural. In the visual novel you don&#039;t even find undeniable evidence that there even is anything supernatural until the end of the common route (adapted in episode 7 in a different version), which is almost 20 hours into it. Yes, you know Kotarou can rewrite himself, and yes, you encounter ominous-looking black dogs in the forest and the city at night as well as numerous suspicious people, but that&#039;s about it. Then when the actual reveal comes, it hits you like a hammer with how dramatic the tone shift is. The early part of Rewrite is supposed to be school/comedy/mystery, and then in the actual character routes it transforms into action/drama/supernatural. But in the anime, they&#039;ve kind of just... jumbled everything together. Kotarou is like yeah I have a super power, Shizuru casually reveals hers without much explanation provided, and when Kotarou is given his &quot;claws&quot; then you&#039;re just going to have to accept what you&#039;re watching because the anime sure isn&#039;t planning on explaining where they came from anytime soon, etcetera. It all feels very mish-mashed without any clear direction, almost as if they did everything in the wrong order. I don&#039;t know, making a good anime out of Rewrite with such a tight schedule is probably impossible no matter what you do; even an original route like this doesn&#039;t really work because the world itself is far too complex for you to be able to make a satisfying standalone arc without it becoming entangled in the &quot;real&quot; story of Rewrite in some way, causing a ton of loose ends that will never be able to followed up upon. It only forces 8bit to include a bunch of scenes they seriously shouldn&#039;t, wasting even more of what little precious screen time they have at their disposal. It&#039;s no wonder the pacing is so all over the place. On top of that the anime also has some incredibly awkward usage of CGI for all the various types of familiars it contains, so the action scenes aren&#039;t exactly a pleasure to look at either. Hell, even the regular 2D art really dips in quality every so often, especially in the last few episodes of the show. It felt like they were having some serious budget issues here, and as a result there were a lot more derp faces than I would have liked.<br />
<br />
As far as the characters goes, I&#039;m also pretty disappointed. I actually consider the visual novel&#039;s character cast to be in my top 5 even to this day, due to its diversity, great character development on many different fronts, and for just being plain entertaining in general. But the anime does... basically nothing to showcase either of these things. First and foremost, there are simply way too many characters in Rewrite for such a short anime to support. It&#039;s a very complex universe including multiple factions, people with drastically different ideals and goals, driven by their own respective backstories, etcetera. There just isn&#039;t anywhere near enough time to explain who they all are and what their purposes in the story really are. Especially considering that (you guessed it) for many of them, said explanations are provided deeper into the various heroine routes of the game, and they&#039;re not just something you can throw out at a moment&#039;s notice. In other words they really never had a chance to be anything more than random supporting characters in the anime because the script doesn&#039;t permit their characters to ever be properly explained or developed. Maybe you should have thought about that before you decided to go full anime original? And this is just talking about the supporting cast; if we talk about the actual main characters here then it&#039;s obviously even worse because all the original main heroines (Kotori/Chihaya/Lucia/Shizuru/Akane) just come across as random harem members in the anime as none of them get any proper characterization to speak of at all. Why? Well... because their routes aren&#039;t adapted. It all keeps coming back to that, doesn&#039;t it? Even Kotarou suffers from this because he&#039;s supposed to grow in those arcs as well.<br />
<br />
Sooo I don&#039;t know, I don&#039;t straight-up hate the show but I just can&#039;t help but feel that it&#039;s so pointless. If you&#039;ve played the visual novel, the anime feels like a massive downgrade in comparison, and if you haven&#039;t played it then you&#039;ll be missing out on so much that it&#039;ll barely be comprehensible due to how confusing the story will be, how much content is cut out and how rushed it is. So what is the target demographic supposed to be? No one can say they&#039;re truly 100% happy with this anime. At least on that front it&#039;s certainly no different from Kajitsu.<br />
<br />
I think the obvious yet unfortunate truth here is that the whole point of this anime is nothing more than to be an advertisement for the Rewrite+ release of the visual novel, which is a new version released on July 29th in Japan this year, I.E: shortly after the anime started airing. It contains new CGs, more voice acting, slight scenario revisions, etcetera. For a long time I was also under the impression that this release was going to contain the new Kagari route as well in visual novel format, but as it turns out that&#039;s actually not the case. It doesn&#039;t really seem to contain any noteworthy new story content at all. So my hypothesis is that the release of Rewrite+ in combination with this original anime is nothing more than a marketing ploy, where people who have no prior experience with the franchise will get a first-time introduction to it through the anime and get interested enough to at least be willing to purchase the game. Then of course since Rewrite+ has just been released recently, which sounds like a much cooler version than the original for people not knowing any better, those new fans will throw their money at the much more expensive &quot;new&quot; game instead of the cheaper &quot;old&quot; Rewrite from 2011. Again, this is just my theory but honestly it&#039;s the only idea I can come up with that can financially justify re-releasing a game 5 years later with hardly any noteworthy changes made, as well as simultaneously making an awful anime adaptation of the same game that is neither satisfying for old fans of the games nor anime-only watchers.<br />
<br />
So with that said, in the end... I can&#039;t help but feel like this anime is meaningless, or at least it&#039;ll only function as a sales booster for the new game release, which is nice for the creators I guess but that doesn&#039;t actually make the anime itself any better for me personally, nor should it for any other viewers of it.<br />
<br />
It has to be said though that if we ignore this show&#039;s origins for a second and just look at it as any other anime among the thousands of others out there, then it&#039;s not the worst thing I&#039;ve ever seen, far from it, but it&#039;d probably be something most people would forget about almost completely within a day or two of finishing it. However, we can&#039;t avert our eyes from the truth that much, and the fact of the matter is that this is supposed to be a representation of one of Key&#039;s three biggest visual novels, alongside Clannad and Little Busters. Personally I&#039;d even say Rewrite is the best of them all; I played all three of them back-to-back way back in the beginning of 2013, and at least for a short time afterwards I actually considered Rewrite to be my favorite visual novel. It might not have maintained that spot for too long but either way the point is that... it just deserves better than this. Yes, I&#039;ve known ever since the day I finished the game that making a proper adaptation of Rewrite was probably impossible no matter what, but I was still hoping for a lot better than what this anime gave us. At the very least it should have gotten more episodes than this; Clannad got 4-cours and Little Busters got 3, why is Rewrite stuck with merely 2? If anything this is the one which needed the most episodes out of the trio since it has a lot less content that can be omitted. Realistically speaking 4 cours would probably have been the optimal pacing-wise given the length of the game. But I guess that&#039;s just the world we live in nowadays: anime are mostly produced in order to promote their source materials and boost the sales of those, and as a result we very rarely see shows with more than 2 cours anymore. For a lot of series that&#039;s totally fine and all, but for ones with very long source materials like this, it&#039;s basically a killing blow, unfortunately.<br />
<br />
Last but not least though, as mentioned previously we are at least getting a second season for Winter 2017 (so it&#039;s a split cour), and this is giving me a certain feeling of déjà vu. See, as badly as 8bit destroyed Grisaia no Kajitsu two years ago, they actually did a very respectable job with its sequels, Meikyuu and Rakuen, and the main reason for that was simply that the sequels are way shorter to begin with and thus much easier to adapt since they didn&#039;t have to rush them so badly, unlike with Kajitsu. And I feel like the same thing could very well happen with Rewrite. In case you don&#039;t know, the visual novel has one route for each of the main heroines (Kotori/Chihaya/Lucia/Shizuru/Akane) and then a two-part True route at the end, with the first part being called Moon and the second part being called Terra. Now in the anime they&#039;ve basically replaced the five girls&#039; routes with this original Kagari route, and the upcoming second season will adapt Moon and Terra. In other words the second season should actually not be anime original, unlike this one. There will probably be minor changes in order to accommodate for everything they&#039;ve done in the first season, but for the most part I reckon it should be pretty much the same as in the game. And above all, just Moon and Terra on their own should actually be doable in 1 cour, so we might actually have acceptable pacing next time around as well. With all that being taken into account, it could actually turn out to be a pretty good anime. The downside is of course that we seriously lack proper buildup for it since none of the heroine routes were adapted first, so I&#039;m not sure how everything will turn out in the end regardless. But I think it at least has decent potential to come out alright for those who are already familiar with those routes, I.E: those who have played the visual novel first. And for those who haven&#039;t... maybe, I guess we&#039;ll just have to wait and see.<br />
<br />
If nothing else, given how unsatisfying this first season has been on its own it can only go upwards from here. Let&#039;s hope the second time&#039;s the charm in this case. Then again I know better than to expect much from 8bit no matter what by now, so I won&#039;t get my hopes up too high just yet.

    A lot of anime each season tends to adapt material from a different medium. Manga, light novels, videogames, and sometimes even visual novels. Of all of them, a visual novel is arguably the hardest to adapt. Why, you ask? Since visual visuals novels tend to have branching narratives with multiple possible storylines and alternate endings, it’s difficult to simply “choose” one to adapt or adapt the “right” one and pull out a good anime from. <br />
Decisions made by the player during the game compound on top of one another and can eventually change which storypath the VN goes down and lead to an alternate ending.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230165">
        It’s not uncommon for VNs to have well over 5 alternate endings, so when it comes to adapting it to anime, how does it actually work out? How do you adapt multiple story lines into one 13 or 26 episode anime? <br />
<br />
In the case of Steins;Gate, studio White Fox decided to adapt a “true ending” route, which is the route that tied up the most loose ends and had the most satisfying ending. In the case of Fate/stay night, studio ufotable and studio DEEN both adapted two out of the three distinct routes from the original VN, and next year studio ufotable will adapt the final route in a trilogy of films titled “Heaven’s Feel”. So when it comes to Rewrite, a commercially successful and critically acclaimed visual novel with around 5 distinctive routes, what does studio 8bit decide to do? Well of course, fuse half of them into one monumental mess!<br />
<br />
Adapting a VN is hard enough, so why does 8bit try and make it harder for themselves by blending multiple stories into one? The original alternate story lines are alternate for a reason; they are purposefully set as different playable routes for the player because of their distinctive nature. The main character, Kotarou, forms different and unique relationships with each of the supporting characters in their respective routes, so what happens when you blend half of them into one? Disharmony is what happens. Unevenness. Asymmetry. A narrative that isn’t well-rounded nor that has a clear and defined goal is what is produced. I can say with sufficient surety that nobody watching Rewrite as it was airing (without prior knowledge from the visual novel) was able to understand what the main conflict or goal was that was present in the story. Studio 8bit’s unreasonably resolute determination to adapt a careless fusion of routes spawns a monstrosity of an anime that forces its viewers into a submission of perplexity.<br />
<br />
Rewrite’s disjointed narrative overflows with a smorgasbord of elements that just don’t click with one another. Slice of life moments, pseudo-harem elements, convoluted supernatural magic powers and giant CGI monsters that will more often that not leave you bewildered and lost rather than intrigued. The stakes are raised to unfathomably unreachable heights, but it is difficult to grasp them tightly enough to take seriously, what with all the convoluted magic stuff and the irrepressible escalation of “what the fuck” moments. <br />
<br />
The problems arisen from the show that materialize from its poor adaptation are mostly contained and limited to the first half, in which Kotarou forms and develops his relationships with the all-female supporting cast he’s constantly surrounded by (hence, “pseudo-harem elements”). Originally, Kotarou is supposed to develop separate and unique relationships with all the girls individually, but since 8bit decided that “just didn’t cut it”, Kotarou insteads fleshes out relationships with only half of the cast. This results in back-to-back episodes expanding on Lucia and Shizuru’s backstories (“sob stories” would technically be the more accurate term) that collectively feel episodic in nature and superficial in execution. It’s very obvious, almost as if explicitly implied, that the show just had to find a way to squeeze in these two character’s backstories because those were part of the routes 8bit decided to fuse together. No real respect is offered towards the rest of the cast, they all feel like plot devices used to escalate the narrative towards the back stories of the two. This lack of authenticity makes the show and characters mechanical and robotic, the only characters that you can empathize with are the two the show force their backstories into. <br />
<br />
Now of course, the poor adaptation isn’t to blame alone. The original narrative of the Rewrite visual novel has its fair share of innate problems that deserve a respectable portion of the blame as well. The narrative of Rewrite shifts its focus from cute girls, high school club goals, supposedly heart wrenching sob stories and then finally sets it sights on world destruction and human extinction. How can it all connect? Where is the delicacy in execution? Earlier I said the show had an irrepressible escalation of “what the fuck” moments. This isn’t an escalation of say, running up a set of staircases dangerously fast like a frantic 10-year-old who’s been suppressing his bladder all day; it’s more like a clinically insane and frenetic individual rocket jumping from the CN tower to the moon, only because the moon “looked cool”. Shifting from cute girls doing cute things to a commentary on the nature of humanity and world destruction is already a pretty implausible change in tone, but actually not entirely impossible. <br />
What Rewrite lacks is a sense of scale. It starts small, with a comfortable high school setting and fictional city within its reach, which disallows room for expansion of tackling immensely bigger topics and more impactful themes and premises; it started with a small scale, when it should have started with a large one and focused on a small part of it; It outlined and gave away little information, when it should have outlined a lot and gave only a small part of it. If it did those things it would transform its irrepressible escalation of “what the fuck” moments into an irrepressible escalation of “oh, that’s how it connects. Awesome!” moments. <br />
<br />
So how could they have adapted it properly? While we’re asking that question, let’s go a little broader. How can an anime adapt its source material properly? Well, the answer is simple: with care. Just care. A little attention to detail here, a little improvisation there, and maybe, just maybe, they’ll be able to translate a possibly great work into an equally great medium. <br />
<br />
Overall: 3/10 || Enjoyment 4/10<br />
<br />
Amongst many avid visual novel players unlike myself, Rewrite is beloved. Talked and praised about endlessly, news of its anime adaption left its near-obsessive fans with a bloated sense of ecstasy; just think, the joy of having something you truly love with all your heart being reshaped into the medium that you love just as much… It’s an unfathomable state of euphoria, albeit if funnily enough trivial, that just can’t be achieved by other things in life. Nothing else raises people’s moods quite like that. There is a “but” though, and it exists because of a studio’s lack of care; not to say studio 8bit didn’t necessarily care for the work, but more so the evident absence of care in execution that can be seen by anyone who’s experienced both the visual novel and the anime adaptation. This execution that lacks finesse and charm unfortunately forces Rewrite to join its brothers and sisters in the collection of anime grouped as “the source material was much, much better.”<br />

    Well well well, Romeo Tanaka. We meet again. It hasn&#039;t even been a year since I reviewed that last atrocity with your name on it, and now you&#039;re teaming up with a company that people only remember at this point because After Story still ranks high on MAL after all this time in order to get recognized by anime fans who will never play your supposed masterpiece Cross Channel, and thus will only remember you as the guy who made Humanity Has Declined and a load of shit that no one cares about. I sympathize with you. I really do. The anime industry is a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review231809">
        fucked up place that holds back actual talent. We all know that by now.<br />
<br />
But like the people who okayed that godawful Ratchet &amp; Clank movie, you&#039;ve got to ask yourself this: is having an anime adaptation of your work really the ultimate prize it&#039;s all cracked up to be? Don&#039;t you realize by now that you work in a video game industry, and thus are inherently incompatible with an entertainment medium that the viewer can&#039;t physically interact with? Don&#039;t you realize that for ever Steins;Gate and Madoka Magica that ends up making it big, there are fifty World Conquest Zvezda Plots, Robotics;Notes, and Classroom Crises. And assuming you do know this, don&#039;t you know that teaming up with fucking 8-bit is considered a mistake in every sense of the word? I mean who even remember what anime they made? Oh right, these are the guys who made Grisaia. And yet somehow, even when you&#039;re working with them, they end up creating a product several times worse to the point that I could have done better.<br />
<br />
You&#039;d think I&#039;d have spent all my outrage regarding Rewrite after the last post I wrote about it and you&#039;d be mostly right, but the thing about this show is that it&#039;s my favorite kind of bad to review on the grounds that it fucks up so royally that you could write more essays about what it does wrong than you can about the many interpretations of Utena. It&#039;s not bad in that &quot;incredibly lackluster to the point that I can&#039;t even remember what it is I&#039;m supposed to be complaining about&quot; that characterized the last few shows I reviewed. This is straight up &quot;I see how this could have been better if it was handled by people with actual talent, or at least a chimpanzee&quot; bad. And even when I&#039;m being calm about it, there&#039;s so many words dripping with unsubtle bile I can write about the product that I can actually cause some impact on the industry by making the producers lose even less money than they already have. Hell, I&#039;ve already written quite a bit and I haven&#039;t even actually started describing Rewrite as of yet. Girls Beyond the Wasteland wishes it could have fucked up as much as this.<br />
<br />
Rewrite is an anime about a young boy named Kotarou Tennouji, living all by himself (of course) in the incredibly environmental-friendly town of Kazamatsuri. A town which houses a bunch of mysterious secrets such as dodgy CG crabs and annoying fairy creatures that our git of a main lead just has to discover the truth about, so he ends up joining an occult club and recruits members to help him out that all happen to be female and only two of them at best exist for the sake of more than just fetish fuel. Of course, in this show&#039;s defense, there is some semblance of a reason for his decision to only invite girls to hang out with him on one of his nature walks whilst ignoring the one male dude who he antagonizes more than Bugs Bunny did to any of the other Looney Toons. It&#039;s because he&#039;s a grade-A pervert who thinks sexually harassing his friends and touching their boobs is a charm point. Hey, I didn&#039;t say the reason wasn&#039;t &quot;pants-on-head&quot;levels of retarded.<br />
<br />
But as is usual for visual novel anime, this is all just a smoke-screen for some upcoming serious plot that the writers seem to think would be a good idea to wait until halfway through the show to introduce for some reason, and in Rewrite&#039;s case, it turns out that Kotarou&#039;s friends actually belong to secret government organizations that are in conflict with each other because one side wants to destroy the world in order for it to be birthed anew and the other side wants to protect humanity even though said world is a morbid state of affairs where humans can kill trees without any repercussions. Yes, the plot is basically X/1999 if you replaced all the pretentiously cool CLAMP characters with little girls who would rather drink tea and bathe in hot springs than actually do something interesting. And yes those are your eyes that just rolled on the floor right now, because your mind can&#039;t comprehend how fucking retardedly mismatched the two plotlines are. I mean what&#039;s next? Harem school club anime that suddenly turns into Breaking Bad?<br />
<br />
Admittedly though, Rewrite does lean heavily on one of its mismatched sides to the point that the other one doesn&#039;t cause much interference. It&#039;s just too bad that said side is the banal school life side where nothing interesting ever happens and there&#039;s no drive to events other than curious retardation. Yeah, remember how I said before that I hate most visual novel anime (and most anime in general for that matter) because for some reason people can&#039;t get it into their heads that &quot;comedic episodes and light conflicts that solely exist to build up the world and the characters so that when the true dramatic story hits, it&#039;s all the more effective&quot; is an absolutely awful concept that no one with a brain would possibly enjoy, let alone prefer to just &quot;starting the dramatic story at the very start&quot;? Well generally, these sorts of shows stop with their inane prologues by the halfway point, but Romeo Tanaka adaptations just can&#039;t seem to grasp the definition of the word &quot;stop&quot;. It takes more than three quarters of the runtime for both Girls Beyond the Wasteland and Rewrite to get something even approaching an ongoing plot, and even then the latter seems to think that it can take a break and let girls relax in hot springs as a sort of reward for all the action that occurred previously, even though said action is only a minor skirmish against a twat that looked awful and no lasting impact because apparently stab wounds are easier to recover from than paper cuts.<br />
<br />
The show is just littered with every bad adaptation choice you could possibly make when adapting an interactive non-linear product to a non-interactive linear world to the point that it feels like we&#039;re living in that shitty visual novel adaptation phase of anime again. Do you remember how one of my big complaints about Charlotte was that it had a severe lack of drama when it was desperately needed? Well it seems Rewrite misinterpreted the complaints people have made about Key products being overly manipulative even harder and decided to only give service to the company&#039;s token melodrama in the worst way possible. There&#039;s only two episodes that try to tug at the viewer&#039;s heartstrings and of course, it&#039;d be directed towards the two girls with no plot-importance whatsoever, as well as being fucking botched to boot.<br />
<br />
Just as an example, one of the episodes in the first half of the show is centered on the purple-haired girl, Lucia, and plays out like a bad horror story with its poorly directed attempts to be creepy that end with Kotarou discovering it was her who was causing all the strange things to happen because she has the ability to poison anything she touches thank to experiments done on her. Said episode ends with her throwing a hissy fit, accidentally poisoning Kotarou, him fixing himself up, revealing that she works for a secret organization, and then happy school life continues again in the very next episode. Excuse me Rewrite for not having the tear ducts required to appreciate sadness caused by &quot;magic&quot; that has never been foreshadowed until now, has no impact on the story beyond a few plot points that you could have conveyed better by shooting someone, doesn&#039;t further anyone&#039;s characterization, and indeed is never brought up again after it&#039;s told!<br />
<br />
I could go on listing all the bad adaptation decisions...so let&#039;s continue, shall we? The animation is uglier than Andrew Lloyd Webber, looking like one of those crappy flash animated shows from the early 2000s with the shining buffed up a bit. And that&#039;s not even getting into the 3D animation for the monsters in this show, which looks so retarded and clashes so badly with the backgrounds that Polygon Pictures themselves would have fired the people working on it. And even by visual novel standards, the characters are just completely unlikable. Kotarou basically bullies and sexually harasses his friends for no reason, constantly begging to touch their breasts even during serious moments to the point that you sympathize with Lucia in regards to wanting to murder the bastard. But for some reason, the girls still hang out with him like the moe tsundere sycophants they are. Even dressing into cat-eared maid costumes at his request because apparently we&#039;re living in an age where people still think it was funny when Higurashi did this. It&#039;s like someone took a bunch of dating sim stereotypes, tacked on an arbitrary twist to each of them, and then beat them over the head with a crowbar that was made out of concentrated STUPID.<br />
<br />
Finally there&#039;s the ending, which is both the best part of the show in how laughably terrible it was in a &quot;I can&#039;t believe you did that&quot; kind of way, as well as the worst part of the show because you couldn&#039;t believe they actually did that. To those who played the visual novel, remember how every single girl&#039;s route would end with the world getting fucked? Well instead of using one of those endings to cap things off, the producers decided to go a bit more original...by ripping off Evangelion like every other anime under the sun. One of the girls performs a ritual that kills off every human being on the planet and turns them into glowing orbs so that our plant life sovereign can reign supreme in a manner that would make Poison Ivy blush. No, I am not kidding. That is actually what happens, and before you guys start thinking &quot;hey, that actually sounds pretty awesome&quot;, note that a sequel adapting the true route that will no doubt retcon the ending harder than Aldnoah Zero did after its three-month break is coming out next season because the creators were so confident that die-hard fans would want it after sitting through this misery. Starting right at the end of this sentence, you have one second to name a single anime where keeping the prologue and the actual meat of the story divided into two distinct series was a good idea. Time&#039;s up. That&#039;s what I thought.<br />
<br />
I am not exaggerating when I say there is literally no audience for this show at all. If you&#039;re a fan of the visual novel, you&#039;ll be turned off by the insipid adaptation choices that basically scream &quot;fuck it, if they paid full price for that Little Busters anime, they&#039;ll pay full price for this&quot;. And if you&#039;re not a fan, you&#039;d be clawing your eyes out at the complete lack of fun on screen assuming you can work up the interest necessary to acknowledge Rewrite&#039;s existence in the first place. I don&#039;t know how well the blu-rays sold, but the number can&#039;t be high. I mean we&#039;re living in an age where the fujoshi market makes up the numbers now and Rewrite definitely doesn&#039;t have much in the way of manservice for fangirls to slobber over. The only people I can possibly see enjoying this show are those with a lead pipe shoved in your brain&#039;s front lobe, and if that&#039;s the case, it&#039;d be cheaper and more exciting to just shove poo down the pipe&#039;s hole.

    Really good anime, as usual for a Key VN adaptation.<br />
Though of course like any other visual novel, unfortunately the reviews have run amok with morons endlessly bickering over how the VN was adapted. Can&#039;t please &#039;em all I guess.<br />
<br />
Anyone interested in this anime, go for it. Definitely give it a watch. Unless you&#039;re one of the bizarre new race of try-hard anime critics who couldn&#039;t judge something well or properly if their lives depended on it, you will enjoy this anime.<br />
<br />
I have a strong feeling season 2 is much better, just given that they decided to adapt a specific route from the Rewrite VN, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review241061">
        season 2&#039;s is more interesting. But still season 1 did a solid job. I don&#039;t really have any complaints really.<br />
<br />
Obviously this isn&#039;t a proper review, it was just disgusting seeing the review section of this anime being such a horrid garbage fire. Really i&#039;m sure most intelligent anime fans don&#039;t actually read the reviews on this site, since within 2 sentences you can already tell it&#039;s just complete trash. But for any that stumble on this review with the thought of not watching the anime because of what others have said, give it a shot. Just do it. It&#039;s only a 13 episode anime anyway.

    This is one of the worst adaptations I have ever seen, and easily the worst Key anime to date.  8-bit, Tensho, and the entire staff should be ashamed of what was produced here.  This Rewrite adaptation is in the similar vein as M Night Shyamalans &quot;The Last Airbender&quot; adaptation where you have characters with the same names and some of the story elements, but presented without soul and crushed down until it possesses none of its quality.  The original source material wasn&#039;t perfect.  In fact I would deem it inconsistent and flawed, but it was refreshingly different from other works from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230037">
        Key and was a very interesting read.  However, to see it degraded to this ugly mess was utterly depressing.  <br />
<br />
Story: 1/10 (atrocious)<br />
<br />
Seriously!?  Who is this adaptation for?  Studio 8-shit thought it was a great idea to horribly rush events directly from the VN for the first half, and then go anime original into a rushed incomprehensible second half.  Like... if you don&#039;t have the time to adapt it and were going to make most of it original, you might as well have made it completely anime original.  If you wanted to adapt the whole thing then trying to do it in merely 13 episodes was a terrible idea in the first place.  The first half will immediately turn off people who haven&#039;t read the novel since it appears to be something generic with rapid tonal swings and horrible pacing.  The second half only goes out of its way to give fans of the novel the finger by creating a train-wreck of several side routes combined into a weird anime original clusterfuck with only one frigging thing original outside of the source material.  Finally if your a Key fan, you will be so emotionally distant from the generic underdeveloped characters that if you were hoping for the famous &quot;feels&quot; you won&#039;t even get that.  There are many elements of the story that will probably seem incomprehensible to new viewers, and when you need the source material to understand what is going on, then it has failed utterly as an adaptation.  <br />
<br />
Characters: 2/10 (terrible)<br />
<br />
Incredibly thin and underdeveloped.  Like the other flawed Key anime Charlotte, most of them only have time to be defined by some single trait that is repeated for punchlines.  &quot;Pervert and lets be BFF generic&quot; Kotarou, the ribbon girl loves coffee, Chihiya is a dumb jock, you have tsundere &quot;don&#039;t touch me pervert&quot; Lucia, you have &quot;cute loli that defends protagonist no matter what&quot; Shizuru.  I don&#039;t even remember what they gave Kotori as a character in the anime.  Two of the characters are given backstories with some scenes that feel like they were on fast forward... I am not even kidding, all of it is so rushed that even as someone who read the novel, I was BARELY able to follow, and felt disconnected pretty quickly.  When you speed up events with no flow or breathing time, it ends up moving too fast for you to digest and process what is going on and what you should be feeling.  The result is a rapid slideshow summarizing whats going on without giving you time or space to feel or care about the events on the screen.<br />
<br />
There are only two characters in the show that could be somewhat entertaining.  One of them is in it for like 10 minutes (Yoshino), and the other was the ribbon girl who ironically has the least personality in the original source material.  The ribbon girl has an anime original circumstance that occurs, and there is a charm to her that sort of works for a single episode that I thought was passable.  <br />
<br />
However, it was when I saw the final episode that I realized how terrible the cast was treated in this horrid adaptation.  You see characters being injured, dying, yelling and screaming in a chaotic battle with supposed high stakes in the air.  Yet, despite having read about them for 50+ hours in the novel, I simply watched bored and emotionally disconnected from everything happening onscreen.  I didn&#039;t care about any of these characters that I remembered liking so much from the visual novel.  None of the charm, fun, or heart of these characters were there.  They were became nothing but hallow shells carrying their names.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation: 3/10 (terrible)<br />
<br />
Rewrite looks ugly.  The art and animation is somewhat passable for the first couple episodes, and then it takes a quality nosedive in the second half.  8-shit decided to make this show CGI heavy and the result is atrocious.  It honestly gives Berserk 2016 a run for its money in awfulness.  I hate the character designs, which look too small and way too &quot;cutesy&quot; for my liking.  The character are very often off-model and look awful in motion at times.  Tensho, the director, is also very weak at framing good actions sequences so even if your just there for decent spectacle it can&#039;t even manage that.  Plus, a personal gripe, why is the lighting always so bright?  Jesus!!<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10 (very good)<br />
<br />
Like... the one saving grace?  Maybe?  Something good to say about this trash is the soundtrack that was taken straight from the visual novel...<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1/10<br />
<br />
I honestly wished this anime didn&#039;t exist.  The fans of the visual novel and of Key deserve much better than this.  I feel very bad for people who loved the original material and was expecting something good.  Unfortunately this isn&#039;t the adaptation you were looking for.  If you aren&#039;t a fan of either Key or the novel, I don&#039;t recommend this either since there are much better options out there.  This entire adaptation needs a rewrite, and from a studio that doesn&#039;t rhyme with shit.  <br />

    Rewrite. The second highest rated Key Visual Novel on VNDB, only surpassed by Clannad. Something more than well worth reading, in my eyes. <br />
<br />
That&#039;s not what this anime is, at all. Not only was it hardly an adaptation with its gratuitous anime original content, but they managed to ruin any small thing they did adapt. <br />
<br />
Therefore, I&#039;m going to review this while trying to put aside my thoughts of the original material.  <br />
<br />
Story: 1/10.<br />
-What is the premise? What am I watching? Where is the plot?- All questions asked throughout Rewrite&#039;s duration. None of which were answered. The fact is, this series had no direction.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230250">
        We have &quot;twists&quot; that are in no way surprising, and generally poorly executed. We have info dump after info dump of information that in the end, really amounted to nothing, and yet we still were left with a plethora of questions. We also got an ending with a vague after credits scene to try and lure us into the next season. A complete, and utter mess. The only reason I rate this a 2, is due to the fact there was a beginning and end, something that I admittedly cannot say for some anime series. <br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
-While obviously lacking, and rather flat, I can&#039;t say I have much to complain about on this front. It was derpy, but hey, with the schedule Aniplex gave 8-bit, who can blame them?<br />
<br />
Sound: 2/10<br />
-The Sound Director for this series... was not originally a sound director. Poorly placed BGMs that blended together awfully, despite being very pretty on their own. Cringe like screams and grunts that generally felt unnatural. Only thing redeeming was the OST itself, which is absolutely perfect. <br />
<br />
Characters: 2/10<br />
-A large cast of characters, of which really only two were given any real development, which even then was minimal. Felt nothing for them, and little to no attachment to them existed. Only rated 2/10 because none of them were bad characters, just very two dimensional and forgetful. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 2/10<br />
-When the pacing and overall themes are so much of a mess they don&#039;t make sense, things go south quickly. <br />
<br />
Overall: 1. <br />
<br />
Honestly, I would&#039;ve dropped this at around Episode 3, if not for my fondness of the somewhat related original material. The show on its own didn&#039;t feel like a chore, but wasn&#039;t something I particularly looked forward to. I honestly wouldn&#039;t reccomend this anime to anyone, even to people who enjoy the genre. If it must be anime, I would have to reccomend something else. <br />
<br />
I do hope that the second season, supposedly adapting the later parts of the original, will be done well. I assume the only people watching it will be fans, or people who actually enjoyed the first season. If that&#039;s the case, let&#039;s hope for the best. :)<br />

    As someone who has played the Visual Novel, this adaptation is disappointing. It is not impossible to create a perfect depiction or adaptation of a VN, a fine example would be Clannad which just happens to be another Key VN.<br />
<br />
I am not saying it has to follow through the VN&#039;s story completely, I am fine with many new plot twists because new content actually excites me. However it is obvious that 13 episodes is not long enough to condense the story of a VN no matter how much you twist and turn the storyline. I wouldn&#039;t hold my breathe for the announced 2nd season either.<br />
<br />
My

          <span style="display: none;" id="review231937">
        advise to whoever is interested in picking up Rewrite is, play the VN first then watch the anime. <br />
<br />
For me, my experience with Rewrite the video game has been truly astounding. The animated adaption has only served me as fanservice.

    The first two episodes are funny school life characterization stuff that was genuinely enjoyable to watch. Then the mystery, supernatural, and action elements begin to become more prevalent, and my interest dived.<br />
<br />
This anime is plagued with issues. Some of them have to do with having too much source material to adapt and thus make the anime feel rushed or overall poorly paced. I will not be talking about those issues.<br />
<br />
Even if an anime is poorly paced, there is a limit to how much an anime can jump from one scene to the next with wildly different tones without it being jarring. One scene can seem

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230047">
        pretty tense and traumatic, and then the next scene goes to a short BS school drama thing and sours all of the emotion of the previous scene. The characters act as if they have NO MEMORY of past events unless the plot demands it, and it screams bad writing. This occurs from the very first episode and doesn&#039;t stop until the plot kicks into high gear around episode 8-ish (your mileage may vary). <br />
<br />
The animation is serviceable in the slice-of-life-y portions, but in action scenes apart from maybe the last episode, the animation is cringe at times and almost laughably bad at others, especially with the anime&#039;s heavy use of CG. Even when the characters are standing still, I don&#039;t remember any points where they looked great. There is nothing visually interesting in this show, which really hurts it since some characters are supposed to be super powerful and action is supposed to play up the tension in some areas.<br />
<br />
These two things alone make the anime painful to watch, but if you are willing to look past them, then you might find a surprisingly interesting story with a few twists. The problem is that the storytelling is bad enough that you might not see the story. <br />
<br />
At the very least, I kind of liked the ending, for both ironic and non-ironic reasons. It sort of hints at the possibility of a continuation. Idk, it could go either way, but I can&#039;t say I&#039;m excited to see another whole season with this kind of quality.<br />
<br />
My advice: Maybe watch the first two episodes. If it looks something like you&#039;d be interested in experiencing, stop watching and figure out some way to play the game. The anime has a different story from the routes in the game, but every route in the game is probably way better than the anime so don&#039;t look back.

    I had to write a review for this. Because Rewrite is my favorite Key work of all-time. Because it deserved better than this.<br />
<br />
If you are wondering if this anime is worth your time, I say this: if the premise catches your eye, or the character designs, or anything at all, I absolutely implore you to check out the original visual novel. It&#039;s deep. It&#039;s beautiful inside and out. It&#039;s got a message that cannot be ignored. None of which can be said about this travesty of an adaptation. 8bit did not know what they were doing, and do not deserve five hours of your time

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230104">
        spent here. Avoid this trainwreck at all costs.<br />
<br />
The story jumps around like a pinball in a dryer. There is no semblance of cohesive storytelling to be found. It takes bits and chunks of the branching &quot;routes&quot; from the visual novel and attempts to tie them together in a haphazard, charmless sort of way. At first I wondered if this was on purpose, like the show was just meant to be a treat for people who have already read the source material it is based on, but no. No reader of the visual novel can find anything redeemable at how badly 8bit botched this.<br />
<br />
Characters have been derailed extensively. Shizuru, Lucia, and especially Kagari act in ways that are unthinkable for their VN counterparts. Kagari is supposed to be an ominous, mysterious entity, a legitimate threat to Kotarou&#039;s peaceful life and instead becomes a caffeine-addicted, narcissistic victim of fart jokes.<br />
<br />
The one thing that Rewrite gets right is the music. It&#039;s taken straight from the visual novel, some truly great pieces that practically tell a story all by themselves. The voice actors are all returned to reprise their roles for this adaptation, but Chiwa Saitou, whose turn as Kotori Kanbe made the character one of the most beloved in the novel, sounds almost chronically bored. It&#039;s a shame, but I think even she saw that this script and this adaptation would be lovingly omitted from any resumes she makes going forward. Kana Hanazawa, my favorite seiyuu of all-time, returns as Kagari, but I&#039;ve already mentioned how badly they&#039;ve botched her character, and it feels like KanaHana knew it too. She puts forth only just enough effort to keep the dysfunctional train on the tracks.<br />
<br />
The art is dreadful. The characters, whose designs are lovingly detailed in the visual novel, are reduced to frilly moeblobs with very little detail. There are some decent panning shots of Kazamatsuri, but that&#039;s about it. And the CG monsters that crop up routinely during the show are just about at the point where they might have looked passable in a 1980s Gundam show. But it&#039;s now 2016, and these CG dinosaurs and leaf dragon look pitiful. Perpetually locked at somewhere south of 18 frames per second, it feels like you&#039;re watching a particularly unappealing PlayStation 2 game.<br />
<br />
In short, this is something to be avoided. I thought I had learned my lesson when I watched their dreadful Absolute Duo adaptation, but at least that was a case where the source material was also uninspired and trite, so 8bit could be almost excused for going through the motions in adapting it. Rewrite is not only great, but a downright tome of greatness, with nearly 100 hours of content. There was no way they were going to be able to do it justice with just 13 episodes, but I would have at least respected an honest attempt to try. Instead, I got a fanservice-laden clusterfuck of scenes that go nowhere, schizophrenic pacing, dull action scenes, and an ending that teases the inevitable second cour. I&#039;ll be taking a pass on that, 8bit. Don&#039;t take it personal. I&#039;ll be too busy &quot;Rewriting&quot; my brain to cleanse it from this disaster.<br />
<br />
Until next time, may the Song of Destruction be heard all across 8bit&#039;s headquarters.

    Rewrite tells the story of Kotarou who has the ability to rewrite parts of his body giving himself superhuman strength or speed. The show follows him as he joins the Occult Club to research supernatural phenomena along with several girls from his school. He is also followed by a mysterious ribbon-wearing girl named Kagari who kills him in one of his dreams, causing Kotarou to consider her a threat.<br />
<br />
The anime is split into two story arcs with the first being the better one out of the two. In the arc, Kotarou learns a lot about the girls during their club activities. At times he is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review231453">
        also attacked by mysterious creatures forcing him to use his abilities to survive. The overall story of the arc is interesting and later takes a lot of unexpected turns. At times however, the plot can seem a bit rushed and may leave the viewer with a lot of questions.<br />
<br />
The second arc mostly follows the ribbon girl, Kagari, as Kotarou learns more about who she is and why she’s following him. Although the arc starts out pretty well, in the end it turns into a rushed mess with the anime trying to explain all the questions raised earlier in a way too short span of time. It also does constant twists that are all done in such a short amount time they only end up confusing the viewer. The ending feels like it was intended to be the something amazing but the writers simply didn’t have the time or the talent to execute it properly. In the end it turns out to be nothing but random events and twists happening constantly with the viewer having barely any idea of what’s going on.<br />
<br />
The interactions between the characters were the best parts about the show for me. One of the most enjoyable things about the first arc was watching Kotarou and the girls living their school lives and doing Occult Club activities. Also, the first half of the second arc, which heavily features both Kagari and Kotarou, was the best part about the otherwise lackluster arc for me.<br />
<br />
Kotarou is very different from the characters in other Key series. He doesn’t have the personality of the typical harem protagonist, making him one of the most unique main characters in a Key anime. Kagari starts out as an emotionless character but later on goes through a change and learns about the positive aspects of humans. The girls in the Occult Club are also very interesting characters. At first, they seem to be there just to create the harem setting most Key series are known for, but throughout the anime it’s revealed that there’s more to them than meets the eye. Some of the girls also have interesting backstories. While they help flesh out their characters, they end up feeling a bit too rushed to have any kind of emotional impact present in other Key anime. The show also feels way too short for the amount of characters in it which leads to a lot of the side characters not getting nearly enough screen time.<br />
<br />
I have some mixed feelings about the animation. The 2D animation for the most part is decent but can dip a lot in quality in certain scenes. There are still certain moments in the series such as the first ending theme that I feel are really well done. The 3D animation is definitely one of the weakest points in the series. It can be very low quality and feel out of place in a lot of the scenes that use it. Even the frame rate in some of the 3D scenes is very low, which should be unacceptable for a pre-rendered scene.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is really good which is to be expected from a Key series. It fits the overall theme of the show really well and does a good job supporting a lot of the scenes. I also liked the opening and ending themes as well as the voice actors of the show. One of the noteworthy performances to me was Hanazawa Kana voicing Kagari as I felt like she did a good job portraying the curious nature of this mysterious ribbon girl as she learns about the daily lives of other people.<br />
<br />
I have a lot of mixed feelings about Rewrite. The show has its moments but ends up being way too rushed. It has a lot of potential with the story and the characters being interesting but suffers from poor execution. The anime felt like it was way too short to properly tell its story and flesh out all the characters. I’d recommend skipping it unless you’re a big Key Studios fan.<br />

    KEY Anime Adaptations plus those KEY Original Anime have been disappointing me for the past few years because of poor handling of said series and the goddamn pacing. I get that producing a 2-cour series is expensive than 1-cour but due to how KEY&#039;s story structure is set-up, 1 cour is NEVER going to work. <br />
<br />
<br />
[Story]: (5/10)<br />
A lot of KEY fans who read the Rewrite VN hyped this series even though the red flags were already raised and flying. I do understand why though. Firstly, it&#039;s a KEY work. Their works are usually really great with great story and amazing characters. Secondly, I just started

          <span style="display: none;" id="review231349">
        playing the VN 2 weeks ago and it&#039;s a lot better than the anime but I&#039;m not going to do a lot of VN - Anime comparisons for this review. I&#039;m just going to write this review as if I&#039;m writing this with no knowledge of the source material. What were the red flags you ask? For starters, 8bit is handling the adaptation and the director is the same director who also directed that messy VN anime adaptation called &quot;Grisaia no Kajitsu&quot;. I mean, need I say more?<br />
<br />
We all thought that 8bit was going to prove themselves by producing a 1 hour 1st episode. Turns out that wasn&#039;t the case. The biggest problem with Rewrite is how rushed the series is. The story wasn&#039;t even bad, by any means, but most of the time, the story can get really confusing because of how rushed it is and how they spend little-to-no time explaining what the hell is going on. The pacing did slow down a bit once the Common Route was over and switched up to the original route called &quot;Kagari&#039;s route&quot; (but it was still rushed as fuck) which wasn&#039;t present in the VN. Not like I have any problem with 8bit doing original route. That was kind-of the purpose of this anime adaptation. To advertise Rewrite and also, to present a new-original route for &quot;fans of the VN and new fans alike&quot;. Notice the quotation marks? Take that quote as you may but my eyes were rolling when I read that quote.    <br />
<br />
If you&#039;ve seen a KEY anime work before before then you&#039;re familiar with how the show is going to be structured. Rewrite&#039;s first 7 episodes is basically the Common Route. It introduces the characters, show some happy and fun slice of life moments and all that crap. I already mentioned this but I&#039;m going to say this again but the pacing pretty much ruined the first 7 episodes. How am I supposed to know the characters properly if the pacing is so rushed? I just didn&#039;t feel for the characters when the show decides to abruptly switches from a slice-of-life moment to dropping a dramatic character flashback right at my face. There&#039;s just no way in hell that&#039;s going to work if the show decides to focus on a certain female character for just 1 episode then her problem gets resolved at the end of the episode and switches to another female character in the next episode. <br />
<br />
Now I want to talk about the episodes past episode 7. Episode 8 and the rest of the episodes after that was when the plot finally began. The show introduces us to the Guardian and Gaia organization. They both work differently so that&#039;s why they fight each other but they have the same goal. Saving the Planet. It&#039;s just that their ways of achieving their goal is completely different from one another. One of the organizations (I forgot who it was) decides to get rid of the humanity because of how they ruined the Planet Earth. Yes, the plot is like some Environmental Awareness ad, to remind us how we&#039;re ruining this planet and to also, probably, make us feel bad about our actions. Kagari is also a major character for this arc and she got more character development than the rest of the characters in the series. That&#039;s not really a praise since Kagari&#039;s character development was just too messy, really rushed and the development wasn&#039;t that much. There&#039;s also a few plot twists, here and there, like how Kagari is actually the Key....whatever the fuck that means...And etc. Some surprised me, some didn&#039;t and some I just didn&#039;t care. <br />
<br />
Rewrites comedict aspect was a hit-or-miss. At times, it made me laugh and at times, it made me laugh...awkwardly. More like the show was trying to force me to laugh. I just didn&#039;t like Rewrite&#039;s sexual jokes. It was mostly Kotaru &quot;accidentally&quot; grabbing someone&#039;s breasts or that he always thinks about groping the &quot;president&#039;s boobs&quot;. I&#039;d like to think that Rewrite&#039;s fanservice was anime-original because there&#039;s no way in hell that these fanservice scenes are present in a VN that&#039;s rated for &quot;all ages&quot;. <br />
______________________________________________________________<br />
[Art/Animation]: (6/10)<br />
I&#039;m going to be in the minority here when I say this but I&#039;m not really a fan of KEY&#039;s art style and the Character Designs in their VNs. I just find it really ugly. Because of those reasons, I prefer 8bit&#039;s Art Style and the anime&#039;s Character Design. Now, in terms of Rewrite&#039;s Animation, it&#039;s very mediocre. You can tell that 8bit wasn&#039;t given that much time to produce this series. Since Aniplex and a whole load of big-name companies are funding this production, I&#039;m very sure that the Animation Issues that this show had wasn&#039;t because of Budget Issues. For example, when it came to the fighting scenes, the staff had to resort to cheap animation tricks because of time constraints. The fighting scenes didn&#039;t even look good and it&#039;s just very unappealing to watch. Even in the 2nd OP Animation, you can tell that the Animation was just crap. <br />
______________________________________________________________<br />
[Sound]: (9/10)<br />
If there&#039;s one thing that the staff did justice in this Anime Adaptation of a Visual Novel, it&#039;s the soundtrack. The VN&#039;s soundtrack sounds really good and it&#039;s one of KEY&#039;s best OSTs yet so I&#039;m glad that 8bit kept most of the OST. Even the 1st OP and ED from the VN was also in the anime. As the show&#039;s OP and ED theme song. For the first 7 episodes, at least. <br />
<br />
The OP theme songs are &quot;Philosophyz&quot; by Runa Mizutani and &quot;End of the World&quot; by Anri Kumaki. I&#039;m really glad that 8bit reused and even remastered the 1st OP, even if it was only for the first 7 episodes. Right now, I love the anime version&#039;s OP way more than the VN version. The anime version sounds more modern and puts more emphasis on the background, something the VN version lacked. As for the 2nd OP, it sounds really weak compared to the 1st OP. It&#039;s not a shitty song, per say, but the 1st OP is miles better than the 2nd OP. However, I still like the 2nd OP though and I like it way more than the VN&#039;s 2nd OP. I hated that song and it baffles me that a lot of people even liked that song. So I&#039;m glad that 8bit made their own OP instead of re-using/remastering the VN&#039;s 2nd OP. <br />
<br />
The ED theme songs are &quot;Sasayaka na Hajimari&quot; by Runa Mizutani and &quot;Word of Dawn&quot; by Aoi Tada. You wouldn&#039;t believe how much I squealed when I heard the 1st ED in Ep.2. The VN&#039;s ED is one of the best ED&#039;s (Also in my Top 10) I&#039;ve heard in a long-ass time and hearing the remastered version in the anime makes the 1st ED sound more beautiful. I also like the anime version more than the VN&#039;s version. Just like the 1st OP, they put more emphasis on the background and making it sound more modern which is the reason why I prefer the anime version. As for the 2nd ED, it sounds surprisingly great. I mean, it&#039;s not better than the 1st ED but it sounds really great and unlike the 2nd OP, the 2nd ED doesn&#039;t sound weak at all. <br />
______________________________________________________________<br />
[Characters]: (5.5/10)<br />
Honestly, the only characters that I liked in the series are Lucia and Kagari. I liked Lucia because she&#039;s a tsundere and I&#039;m a big fan of tsundere girls. I also like Kagari because she&#039;s the only funny character in the series. As for everyone else, they could have been a lot better if they&#039;ve gotten a lot more screentime. Or in other words, the series needed MORE THAN 13 episodes to flesh out the characters instead of rushing through their character development. Also, those 1 episode arc that focuses on Shizuru and Lucia was simply not enough for me to give a crap about their past and the problems that they were facing in the present. They were simply too rushed. <br />
<br />
Now I&#039;m going to talk about some of the main characters. Kotarou Tennouji, the main protagonist of the series, is a high school student and has an ability called &quot;Rewrite&quot;. I really have no more idea what to talk about him because his character is bland, his personality is really inconsistent, and he barely got any character development.  Why is his personality inconsistent, you ask? The guy doesn&#039;t have his own personality. His personality somehow switches depending on the girl that he hangs out with. The guy gets all perverted and idiotic around Akane (The president of the Occult club) but he acts differently when he&#039;s around with Kotori or Lucia. He&#039;s like a different person depending on the girl that he hangs out with and I just couldn&#039;t figure out his TRUE personality. <br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s Kotori, a childhood friend of Kotarou. She seems like an innocent normal person at first who doesn&#039;t know anything about the supernatural things but then there&#039;s a plot twist about her. I was, honestly, surprised learning the truth about her. Then there&#039;s Chihaya, a girl with super-human strength. Chihaya felt like she was a non-existent character. The show didn&#039;t really focus that much on her. It&#039;s like she only got 5 mins. of screentime every 2-3 episodes. Hell, I didn&#039;t even know her name throughout the show. While the show was airing, I kept calling her the &quot;Orange-dressed Tsundere girl&quot;. I wasn&#039;t even sure if she was a tsundere but since she was an almost non-existent character, I just don&#039;t care. <br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s Akane Sunri, the president of the Occult club. She&#039;s a gamer because she can be constantly seen playing a FPS (First Person Shooter) game and she has the personality of &quot;Why the fuck am I here&quot; type of girl. Then there&#039;s Shizuru Nakutsu, a loli girl with an eye-patch that made her look like a chuunibyou at first but turns out, it was more than that and there was a reason why she was wearing an eye-patch. Then there&#039;s Lucia Konohana. All you need to know about her is she&#039;s a stereotypical tsundere girl who punches Kotarou from time to time and if you pay attention to her hand, there&#039;s a reason why she&#039;s constantly wearing a glove and that&#039;s where her 1 episode-arc will focus on. I admit, I enjoyed Lucia&#039;s arc but it could have been better. <br />
<br />
Last but not least is Kagari. A mysterious character who kept popping up on Kotarou&#039;s dream and making mysterious appearances on Kotarou&#039;s bedroom and his school. Kagari became my most favourite character in the series after episode 7 because I love her personality and she was really hilarious. Her jokes did become overplayed on the later parts of her arc. For example, her &quot;FEECOF&quot; jokes were funny at the start but became somewhat annoying at the end. I can&#039;t wait to see more of her in the next season because I heard from VN readers that she gets more focus on the &quot;Moon&quot; and &quot;Terra&quot; arc.<br />
______________________________________________________________<br />
[Enjoyment]: (6/10)<br />
Despite how mediocre this series, I still somewhat enjoyed this series. The 2nd arc was more enjoyable and bearable then the &quot;Common Route&quot;.  I wouldn&#039;t say that this is the worst anime I&#039;ve ever seen because there&#039;s a whole lot more anime this year that&#039;s worse than Rewrite. <br />
______________________________________________________________<br />
[VERDICT]<br />
Rewrite could have been a great series if it had 26 episodes but sadly, it suffered the same fate as &quot;Charlotte&quot; and &quot;Angel Beats&quot;. The story and the characters needed more than 13 episodes to flesh out the story and its characters. Instead, what we got is a series with a very rushed/poorly explained story and a cast of characters with barely any focus, screentime or character development. If you&#039;re a fan of the Rewrite VN or you&#039;re looking for a great KEY anime then Rewrite is not the anime you&#039;re looking for. Charlotte and Angel Beats were also rushed but not as rushed as Rewrite and those series were more bearable to watch than this. <br />
<br />
<br />
[OVERALL]: (5.7/10)<br />
<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
+Amazing Soundtrack, especially the remastered OP and ED theme songs from the VN<br />

    Ill write the same review as I did with the second season. If you just watched season 1 or haven&#039;t watched a season feel free to read because I didn&#039;t really wrote any spoilers<br />
<br />
When I watch, finish, understand and feel an Anime I get depressed after I finish it, thats how I rate an anime. <br />
<br />
This anime made me feel mixed emotions specially at the end of the two seasons. The end of season 1 was depressing and could have kept me depressed for a long time if I watched it while it was being aired but since I watched it  late season 2

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289425">
        was already waiting for me. Of course that didn&#039;t lessen the impact the scenes gave. Plot wise id say it made my feelings dance. Specially season 1 where there are good mix of comedy specially between Kotarou and Yoshino, Romance and friendship between Kotarou and his harem. The lacking of action was understandable and it was also Okay considering their  age in season 1. <br />
<br />
 Season 2 was kinda depressing specially after you build up ships and favorites in season 1. But it gave a new taste to the anime too and kinda a huge leap in terms of character development for the characters. The first episode was really emotional and may confuse other people(I wasn&#039;t) but those scenes was really specially to how the story will progress around Kotarou. Personally I didn&#039;t ship any because it was kinda obvious already AND I didn&#039;t really like Kagiri character wise but plot wise she did blend well. The ending may also confuse some people but if you look at episode 1 and the major happenings in season 1 you will understand why Kotarou progressed to that. It was very depressing but it kinda gives you that peace in mind knowing what happened and you can already guess what will happen even if the anime didn&#039;t continue. <br />
<br />
In short I describe this anime as &quot;Having a Beautiful Story and Character design.&quot; I&#039;m guessing not everyone will like it and of course it didn&#039;t reach the mainstream flatform but that&#039;s okay because this anime is really special

    This review is split into two sections:<br />
- The first section is devoted to those who are new to Rewrite and are contemplating watching the anime adaptation. This section is entirely spoiler free.<br />
- The second section is dedicated to those who have already read the Visual Novel. This section contains major spoilers.<br />
<br />
First Section (for people new to Rewrite)<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
An Introduction: Key is a company that is renowned for its visual novels, most of which enjoy critical acclaim. Almost all these VNs have anime adaptations, which enjoy varying degrees of fame – be it Clannad, which holds the position of one of the top few anime of MAL,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230614">
        or Air, which is relatively unheard of. Whichever the case may be, the general consensus is that all these anime are quite good, since they all take advantage of the ‘feels’ factor (as in making the viewers attached to the characters and then making them feel some degree of emotional turmoil by putting those characters through adverse conditions). Rewrite is Key’s latest flagship VN, which was released way back in 2011. While Rewrite was very successful in the market, it still took around 5 years for it to get an anime adaptation, which we see here today. I shall be going into some detail about this anime in the paragraphs to come.<br />
<br />
Story (3/10):<br />
While the plot itself is passable, let me remind you that plot is not the only element under consideration in this section. The biggest issues with the story are the pacing and presentation. <br />
The pacing is extremely haphazard and the various scenes seem to jump from one to another without any concern for flow. This often ruins the impact of many important scenes and makes the viewer wonder what exactly is happening. The presentation of many scenes tend to unnecessarily give the viewers the wrong idea about these events of the anime, which can lead to a good deal of frustration.<br />
When you try to cram a 60+ hour Visual Novel into a 13 episode anime, there are two possible outcomes – A badly paced rush-job or a completely different story. While Rewrite was supposed to have a different story from the VN, it has all the features of the former case. <br />
<br />
Characters (3/10):<br />
I knew that the short duration of the anime adaptation would limit the amount of character development that could be given to most characters, but I never expected it to be this terrible. <br />
The characters are extremely clichéd to begin with - a happy-go-lucky protagonist, a childhood friend girl, an ‘aho’ transfer student girl, a modern tsundere class rep girl, a healing presence/small furry animal type kouhai, a domineering yet lazy senpai, a mysterious loli and a chuunibyou delinquent – basically a buffet of all the stereotypical characters that you may find in any school-based anime, with some combinations thrown in the mix…. And that’s the good part.<br />
A little later into the show, development is forced on the characters so hard that almost all of them feel broken by the end of it. Some of the characters are changed so much that they’re not even the same characters any more. Viewers who are new to Rewrite will have a lot of difficulty understanding the behaviour and dialogues of many of these characters.<br />
<br />
Sound (7/10):<br />
The soundtracks and the OPs are just remixed versions of the same from the VN, but are still quite pleasant to the ears, though there are some moments where the soundtrack doesn’t match the situation. The EDs are above average.<br />
<br />
Art (4/10):<br />
This is where the low budget of Rewrite really shows. The regular animation is passable at most times, though you’ll find a lot of horribly warped faces and such if you happen to pause at the wrong moment. <br />
It also makes use of some really clunky CG at times, which serves to further ruin the effect. The main issue is that the scenes where CG is used tend to be rather important to the plot, thus decreasing the enjoyment of the series on the whole.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (4/10):<br />
The anime version of Rewrite seems to be fan service aimed at those who have already read the VN. Those who are new to the series will find it extremely difficult to follow. It is quite dull for the majority of the episodes, while some episodes are mildly intriguing.<br />
<br />
Overall (4/10):<br />
You’d think that 8bit studios might have learned something from their extremely messy adaptation of the Grisaia trilogy, but guess what – Rewrite is an even bigger abomination. I had predicted that it would end up something like Charlotte… looks like I was mistaken – Charlotte is infinitely preferable to this.<br />
As I have already mentioned before, the main purpose of this adaptation seems to be – to appeal to the pre-existing fans and to advertise the source material. Both of these seemed to have failed rather miserably.<br />
Verdict – Don’t watch it. You’re just spoiling a perfectly good Visual Novel for yourself. Even if you’re not planning to read the VN, the anime is still not worth the effort. Give this one a pass unless you really want to waste a couple of hours of your time (for which there are far better methods and shows).<br />
<br />
Second section (For the Rewrite veterans – HEAVY SPOILERS)<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
I’ll mainly be talking about the story and characters in this section.<br />
As you may already know, the anime was supposed to follow an original route, which should give a brand new story. In fact, what we actually got here is an amalgamation of pretty much all the routes, done in a very messy fashion. <br />
The base is the Terra route, with a few scenes from the Moon route thrown in every now and then. The first parts (back-stories) of Lucia’s and Shizuru’s routes are given one episode each, while Chihaya and Kotori are largely ignored. Akane gets a little bit of time, but more focus is given to her transformation into the new prophet rather than anything else. Pretty much all of them are broken or close enough to make no difference. In fact, the only character who actually got a decent representation was Yoshino, short as his screen time was. Kagari is the most messed up of the lot, as they completely changed her personality… and not for the better.<br />
In the end, this anime can be considered a tutorial on ‘How to butcher a perfectly good Visual Novel’. If you absolutely must watch it, go in with zero expectations, with only the hope of revisiting the world of Rewrite. Otherwise, just don’t bother.<br />
With this, I conclude.<br />

    Have you ever look forward to a new episode that you can’t stop thinking about all throughout the week? Well, that was the exact opposite with me and Rewrite. Trying to make a joke about wanting the show to be “rewritten”, but now I just wished it wasn’t written in the first place. Everything about it was a whole lot of wrong.<br />
<br />
I’ll admit, I have not played the original visual novel. However, I won’t use that as an excuse to why I didn’t like it. There were other adaptations of works by Key that were fairly decent. Planetarian was one that was came out the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230103">
        same time and was much shorter, but at least that was more entertaining. Again, I know nothing of the original source, so I don’t know what is faithful or not. But, that doesn’t mean I can’t distinguish a good story from a bad one.<br />
<br />
That brings me to the story. It’s so difficult to describe that I’m having trouble figuring out what to write in this section. The one thing that bothered me the most, when it comes to the story, is the lack of context. Rarely were things explained, and if so, it was in the vaguest way possible. What’s worse than a bad story is having horrible pacing added to it. I first noticed it in an early episode that focused on a certain character. We get their backstory, and it’s done so quickly that it gives us no time to appreciate (for a lack of better terms) this character’s history. The second half of the show goes so downhill and becomes mind-numbingly ludicrous that I didn’t even react. The overall mood was kind of a mix, as well. It seems serious at times, but isn’t afraid to put in a random fart joke (there’s only one, but it’s really off-putting).<br />
<br />
While the story may be out there, I can’t say the same thing for the characters. Zero personalities, zero chemistry, zero everything. There is not a drop of redeeming quality to these people that we’re supposed to follow for twelve episodes. I have the strange suspicion that they were well written in the visual novel because we’ll have more time to know them better. For me, I wouldn’t care if the story was terrible, as long as the characters were interesting enough. That’s definitely not the case with this. I couldn’t care less what happens to anyone, and when things did happen to them, I didn’t bat an eye.<br />
<br />
The only thing worse than a bad story and a bad set of characters is bad animation, and it really shows here. From episode one, right off the bat, the visuals were unpleasing, and it actually managed to get worse with each week. Not only do we get terrible-looking character designs and action sequences, we’re even presented with horrendously rendered CG creatures. When both of them are shown together, it is an eyesore. There was never a single moment where I was able to say that something “looked nice”.<br />
<br />
For the most part, I can get behind the idea that not everyone has the same opinions on something. Yet, there are shows like Rewrite that makes me wonder why there are people who did enjoy it. Currently, it has close to a rating of 7 on the site, and that puzzles me. How can one look at a single episode of this and say “that was good”? I knew, from the beginning, this show’s fate was already chosen. I knew what I was getting myself into.<br />
<br />
There is just one thing now I don’t understand: Why is it getting a second season?

    If anyone has read some other review that he has done he will know that clarifies whether or not it contains romance and this is no exception.<br />
Rewrite is a full-fledged harem but it gives more importance to the mystery than to the same romance but of course the romance is more than present, each heroine has its own small story that helps us understand why its actions but not this Deceive them since centering more on the mystery leaves you more doubts than answers so if you are of people who hate not knowing what happens best think twice before seeing it, entering more into

        the romance could describe it as boring and deceptive but clear Is my opinion of the first season, as it seems that the second will bring great changes. In short Rewrite is an anime that I catalog as a gamble as it may interest you or it may bore you.

    Key&#039;s claim to fame has always been supernatural harem VNs with deeper meanings and plotlines that go past your typical romcom-style visual novel as themes involving them are usually thought-provoking to some extent and have more value to them with each route that the player accomplishes.  Pairing up with animation studios like Kyoani and P.A. works, the newest Key adaptation comes from our friends at 8bit who can&#039;t create a bloody cohesive story, Rewrite.  And I must beg the question.  8bit, you sure this series DIDN&#039;T need a rewrite?<br />
<br />
Story: Tennouji Koutarou is a classic harem protagonist going to a school that has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230076">
        rather ornate-looking female uniforms.  Upon finding himself associating with the occult club, he is asked a question from its president asking whether or not if he had the choice, would he save the world?  <br />
<br />
Following what has been confirmed as one of the final routes of the Rewrite VN, the story of this adaptation is...messy.  Yeah, I&#039;m not gonna sugarcoat it, it&#039;s confusing as f**k.  The first problem that comes from Rewrite as a whole is the fact that the entire series follows one of the ENDGAME ROUTES of the entire visual novel, you know, the route that you&#039;re only supposed to play or have access to when you have completed everything else and get an understanding for everything?  And so, because of this, the show comes as a confusing mess that attempts yet fails miserably at really creating a cohesive and concise story to explain the  themes and overall plot of the series.  Examples of this are when several characters talk about specific things or epiphanies which when you watch without any context, really doesn&#039;t make any or very little sense.<br />
<br />
Context aside, the bigger problem that I see with Rewrite is the fact that the show has awful pacing.  The show spends about half of its runtime with high school romcom/harem-esque setup that not only squanders the runtime, but takes away from the show&#039;s second half with a war between the two factions that this show exhibits, Gaia and Guardian.  I personally find this to be a huge shame to this series because the actual content of this series actually seemed interesting and it was a real downer to see that the show really didn&#039;t deliver on its potential.  Though granted, I&#039;m not sitting through 20 cours of material to get the full scope of this series, so...yeah.  Its rushed pacing broke the second half and added only more and more loose and poorly executed details that ended in an ending that unless you&#039;ve actually played Rewrite, you will most likely not get.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Actually interesting storyline<br />
-  Piss poor pacing<br />
-  Endgame route which without context, doesn&#039;t make much sense<br />
<br />
Characters: Visual novel characters from Key always have a tragic or less than happy backstory to coincide with the overall nature of their works.  Rewrite is no different, and therefore has problems because lol8bit.<br />
<br />
With Koutarou, you get what you would expect from a Key protag, which is basically the kind of character who is the complete opposite of your generic harem protag who gets flustered around women and is denser than the earth&#039;s core.  But really, that&#039;s all you get.  The pacing of this series is done in a way that as a character, anything regarding Koutarou&#039;s character in the slightest doesn&#039;t really change.  He&#039;s pretty stagnant all the way and things in the series just kinda...go along whether it&#039;s under his power or not.  Any and all change that he does have feels unnatural and rushed and overall doesn&#039;t really make his character any more or less interesting.  Granted he is a VN protagonist surrounded in girls, but hey, Key always somehow makes the player character interesting in some way, so it&#039;s not impossible to make them cool or at least interesting.<br />
<br />
The last character I will talk about is &#039;Ribbon Girl&#039;.  I&#039;m not spoiling her name for anyone who actually wants to watch this series (lol), but I will say that her name does actually get announced in the series, but it&#039;s so painfully late that I&#039;m still calling her &#039;Ribbon Girl&#039; for the rest of the series and as I&#039;m writing this.  Now, Ribbon Girl is what would arguably be this route&#039;s heroine.  The problem is, you don&#039;t really get to know or understand much about her.  The series treats her as the plot device object that everyone wants (which she...kinda is) but as a character, we don&#039;t get much about her.  She doesn&#039;t feel developed beyond some comedic character traits and understanding of such a character feels and is really minimal.<br />
<br />
As for the rest of the girls in the series who belong to their own respective routes that we&#039;ll never see...well, they&#039;re shafted.  There&#039;re really no two ways to go about it since that&#039;s just how these VN adaptations go.  For a few of them we do get a bit of an understanding of their tragic past and how they ended up the way they do, but they&#039;re just really unnecessary details that I feel really shouldn&#039;t even be bothered because the series doesn&#039;t focus on them since they&#039;re just treated as side characters in this specific adaptation.  Other side characters have even less detail and I would argue to not really give much thought to any of them if at all.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Interesting and entertaining characters<br />
-  All members of the cast have little to no actual depth to them<br />
<br />
Art: As expected with 8bit, the artwork and overall style that they went with was pretty on-par with their standards and quality.  They stuck true to Key&#039;s moe artstyle and the entire look of the series has this nice bright sheen to it that adds to the overall quality.  There&#039;s little to no actual ecchi as you could expect in a series like this, so I suppose that&#039;s a sort of plus.<br />
<br />
However, what does bother me personally is the usage of CGI in this series.  The CGI that the show uses really clashes with the overall look of the handdrawn animation and is actually quite jarring to look at, especially since its usage is increased dramatically as the episodes go by.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Good quality hand-drawn animation<br />
-  The CGI clashes with the look of the series<br />
<br />
Sound: Apart from the second OP in the second half of the series known as &quot;End of the World&quot; (Hmm, I wonder what could be happening in this show?), the rest of the soundtrack really isn&#039;t all that exciting or memorable.  Only this one OP is perhaps the only real notable track that I could find throughout the entire series.   <br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment: Admittedly, I like Key.  While their works don&#039;t always get the best reception or adaptations due to the way that their visual novels are structured, I was intrigued to see what kind of things 8bit, a company that I&#039;ve had a pretty rough history with would do to completely and utterly destroy the kind of content that Key has made.  Watching Rewrite...I don&#039;t really know what I expected to be completely honest.  I went into this series thinking it was going to be subpar at best, and despite getting something that was admittedly worse than my original expectations, I didn&#039;t really expect anything less.<br />
<br />
Did I like this series?<br />
<br />
I like the characters.  While they were lacking in the development or backstory department as Key always does, their base character traits, especially Koutarou were enough to keep a smidgen of interest for me to continue, although the lack of development probably pissed me off more than it should.<br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I like about this series?<br />
<br />
Ok, I never played Rewrite.  I went into this series pretty much completely blind.  Things.  Didn&#039;t.  Make.  Sense.  In order to make sense of anything in this adaptation, I had to resort to wikis and other information sources on the plot of Rewrite to even get an bit of an understanding as to what I was watching here.  And even with that, I still didn&#039;t get what was even happening.  This, this I hate.  I get that this was supposed to be an adaptation for the last route of the game, but at the very least, try and make the whole series somewhat cohesive.<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this series?<br />
<br />
Hmm...no.  My suggestion is to just play the VN is you actually want to understand the Rewrite series.  The actual content of this adaptation isn&#039;t terrible, it&#039;s just not that good and really doesn&#039;t have much merit to it because of the sheer number of plot holes and execution problems that this adaptation had.  Content-wise, it had something to it.  Execution-wise, terrible and should be ashamed of itself for its piss poor pacing.
