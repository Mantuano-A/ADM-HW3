    One of the most annoying things about the anime industry is the seemingly ingrained belief that bandwagons, when jumped upon, have the mystical ability to carry studios into money. It&#039;s a sad fact that every season will undoubtedly see the release of one or more shows that clearly attempt to piggyback on the success of something that has gone before. Thankfully following trends isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing, and every so often a series comes along that can be considered a superior example of its genre.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately that also means that the majority of titles that do jump on the bandwagon are mediocre at best.<br />

        light novel series by Sugii Hikaru, Kamisama no Memochou (God&#039;s Memo Pad), tells the story of a socially awkward high school student, Fujishima Narumi, and his exploits with the NEET Investigation Firm (apparently &quot;It&#039;s The Only NEET Thing To Do&quot;). The story begins with a series of text messages that lead to a seemingly unrelated scene in a love hotel involving a school girl, a businessman, a delinquent of some sort, and an attempt at blackmail that ends with an ashtray to the head. Narumi, having recently moved to Tokyo, finds himself geographically challenged to the point where he&#039;s in a perfect position to see that same girl jump out of a window.<br />
<br />
After that things get a bit random.<br />
<br />
One of the major problems with Kamisama no Memochou is that the plot doesn&#039;t really have any particular goal or objective. The story is told in a series of short arcs that often have very little direct relation to each other, and while this does tie in to the idea of individual cases at an investigation firm, the lack of any real focus causes the narrative to meander before any conclusion can be reached. In addition to this there&#039;s a surprising degree of contrivance apparent in the development of the plot, and while it&#039;s true that certain events are necessary to implement the growth of particular characters, it&#039;s much more preferable to have such things implied, inferred or even insinuated.<br />
<br />
That said, there are some interesting threads woven into the plot that lay a good foundation upon which the story can be told, and if one is able to ignore the obvious prefabrication in the narrative then there is a degree of entertainment to be found.<br />
<br />
Which brings up the issue of the company that Alice runs.<br />
<br />
NEET simply means &quot;Not in Employment, Education or Training&quot;, which is a roundabout way of saying that a person is not just unemployed, but also has no real intention of finding a job. Given this fact, how can a NEET Investigation Firm exist when the simple act of working means that a person is no longer a NEET? To many folks it may seem like nothing more than splitting hairs, but in actuality it&#039;s the most prominent example of the mentality behind the series (more on this in a bit).<br />
<br />
Because Kamisama no Memochou is set in the &quot;real&quot; world, there&#039;s a degree of mundanity to the artwork that is surprisingly well suited to the series. There&#039;s also little in the way of flamboyance where the characters are concerned, but while the design principle seems focused on normality, the series suffers from a certain tired old saw involving beauty and people who aren&#039;t very nice. On the plus side, the animation is pretty decent for the majority of the show, and is only really let down by some poorly incorporated CG or the odd repetition of particular sequences (there&#039;s one in the first episode - see if you can spot it).<br />
<br />
The series opens with a rather straightforward introduction to the main members of the cast, all to the tune of &quot;Kawaru Mirai&quot; by Choucho. On the other hand the main ending theme, &quot;Asunaro&quot; by Suzumura Kenichi, is set to a montage that focuses on Alice and Narumi, and features lots of tumbling negative words and rapid fire photos. In addition to this the first episode concludes with a a rather dizzying series of photographs and images against the backdrop of &quot;Colorado Bulldog&quot; by Mr. Big (and if you want to know who they are, google it or ask your older siblings or parents). As for the background music, while the tracks on offer are varied and atmospheric that doesn&#039;t mean that they&#039;re always necessary, and in truth several scenes would be better without any sort of accompaniment.<br />
<br />
When it comes to storytelling it&#039;s often the case that a relatively weak plot will be masked by philosophical or psychological discussions, and that&#039;s pretty much what happens here. The script has a tendency to get bogged down in semantics and there seems to be an almost desperate need to expound upon the reasons for every action taken. Thankfully the voice actors are a pretty decent bunch, and while there are occasions where the performances are a little too excitable or overbearing, for the most part each role is handled fairly well.<br />
<br />
One of the more interesting aspects of Kamisama no Memochou is the manner in which the characters interact with each other, especially the contrast between the established relationships and the manner in which Narumi&#039;s connections to everyone evolve over the course of the series. Now while this suggests some very good character development, sadly that&#039;s not the case as the story follows the old idea that drama leads to growth.<br />
<br />
As the main lead much of the focus tends to fall on Narumi, but aside from certain events that force him to take charge he doesn&#039;t actually change very much until the last few episodes. One could argue that his introspective monologues are symptomatic of his evolution, but in truth the conclusions he reaches aren&#039;t reflected by any substantial changes in his personality. Right up to the end of the series he remains a figure who seems ill at ease with his role, and this seems like a wasted opportunity to explore what could have been a very interesting character.<br />
<br />
The downside to this is the lack of attention given the rest of the cast, and there are a number of points that remain unanswered come the end of the show. Who is Alice? Why did she start a detective agency? How did the rest of the team gather? Not once does Kamisama no Memochou attempt to address these questions, and worse still, Narumi doesn&#039;t even ask them. Apparently his character is content to remain ignorant of things that anyone in his situation would naturally want to know.<br />
<br />
Which neatly brings us back to the mentality behind the series.<br />
<br />
Intelligence is a difficult thing to gauge when it comes to stories, and one of the common assumptions is that the reader or audience will be unable to understand the choices, motivations and actions of this or that person. Writers make an effort to counter this, and the usual response is to load the dialogue with lots of big words, philosophy, psychology, psuedo-science, and other highbrow musings. The problem is that they often become so enamoured with their own intelligence that they begin to lose sight of what&#039;s important, and elements begin to creep that really don&#039;t belong or should have been thought out properly.<br />
<br />
In the case of Kamisama no Memochou this manifests itself not just in the name of the company. One has to question the basic premise of a girl of indeterminate age (but probably around 12 or13 years old), with a mild Dokupe addiction living alone surrounded by high tech equipment. In addition to that one has to wonder why a show about detectives and mysteries would need an episode dedicated to fanservice or baseball.<br />
<br />
This series has the potential to good, if not great, but there are far too many occasions where it takes its cues from titles like Gosick, not the least of which is the inclusion of an eccentric loli detective and her well meaning, yet slightly bumbling &quot;assistant&quot;. As with many other tales of mystery, there&#039;s an element of entertainment that stems mainly from the viewer trying to figure out who, what, why and how, but that&#039;s where the magic stops. Although there are occasions where the show is interesting, and sometimes a little charming, these are always overshadowed by one question - who is Alice?. The lack of any explanations about her places a burden on the narrative that remains throughout the series, and while the show tries to mysticise her character from time to time, this is nothing more than an attempt to stop the viewer asking unwanted questions (&quot;it&#039;s magic so it doesn&#039;t need an explanation&quot;).<br />
<br />
Kamisama no Memochou is, at best, an interesting mystery anime, but like so many other shows that are the product of jumping on the bandwagon, it relies too much on the success of titles like Gosick, and too little on what it could have been.

Kamisama no Memochou is more than just a detective anime featuring not-really-NEETs and a loli mastermind. It&#039;s an anime that really takes the time and effort to create a realistic yet fantastic world and populate it with some of the most endearing characters in all of anime. The plots of each mystery is engrossing and exciting; the characters are not at all static, growing and changing as the anime moves forward.<br />
<br />
When it comes to good detective animes, this is about as close to perfection as you&#039;ll get.<br />
<br />
Story (9/10)<br />
Art (8/10)<br />
Sound (9/10)<br />
Character (8/10)<br />
Enjoyment (9/10)<br />
<br />
The story of KamiMemo is both cliche as well

          <span style="display: none;" id="review102643">
        as original. The first episode starts off pretty predictably: ordinary high school boy accidentally encounters strange people/event, gets curious and ends up being involved in some way shape or form. Don&#039;t let this banal opening discourage you! The rest of the anime picks up the slack and really shows off the depth of this series. The Angel Fix case is truly a climax and arguably one of the most well-done story arcs in anime history.<br />
<br />
Even the filler episode is done with a planned beginning, middle, and end, as well as a key plot element that both initiates and resolves the conflict. If that&#039;s not good writing, then I don&#039;t know what is.<br />
<br />
The anime demonstrates an exceptional grasp of the concept &quot;detective anime&quot;. &quot;Detective&quot; implies that the plot must contain a great deal of mystery, of assumption and deduction that should engage the audience, while &quot;anime&quot; means that this is, above all else, a show meant to entertain and impart something valuable to us viewers. KamiMemo balances between these two aspects by focusing more on the &quot;how&quot; of the mystery rather than the who, what, when, or where. While the actual truth may not be all that surprising, the process and methods that Alice and her gang employ to uncover the truth gives the anime the atmosphere of being &quot;on the case&quot;, which makes the anime that much more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
KamiMemo doesn&#039;t have the best art I&#039;ve seen, but then again I&#039;m probably being spoiled by Oreimo. The art is very similar in style to TMoSH, which further deepens the similarity between the two anime (explanation in Characters section). Good artwork all around, no derpy, awkward angles, and characters are portrayed both distinctly and realistically. Emotions are very easy to read, and mood is well-portrayed through the colors.<br />
<br />
I originally found this anime because Kakenukeru Anison Medley I ended with an extremely long excerpt of Kawaru Mirai. Which happens to be an amazing OP; Choucho sings some of the best OPs out there, along with Kawada and Lia. The rest of the OST is filled with solid music overall. Notable mentions include Teddy, the haunting song played whenever Alice explains the harsh truth.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t understand what the emphasis on NEETs where - Alice makes tons of cash from taking her cases. NEET detective is quite the awkward irony. Besides that point, the characters in KamiMemo are very well done - they immediately and easily reach beyond their given roles in the story. For example, Ayaka is supposed to be just a schoolfriend, but ultimately becomes such an integral part of the NEET squad that her tragic fall in the final arc really makes an impact on both the viewers and the characters.<br />
<br />
One of the unique points of the anime is that the protagonist, Narumi, is given the Kyon effect. The Kyon effect is given to a high school boy, either in their first or second year, who is perfectly normal yet manages to attract around him an array of weird and bizarre characters, many of whom are quite gifted or have surreal abilities. Through these people around him, the Kyon-effected boy is given a chance to break out of his normalcy and become something more than what he was before by the merits of his character and the power of his will.<br />
<br />
While it may sound overused (and it only does because Haruhi is ridiculously overreaching), the Kyon effect is in fact not commonly used because of its delicate nature and the mixed reactions that the community usually gives in return. Narumi plays the role perfectly, becoming a hero in his own right through the course of the anime. Instead of a pathetic character who only knows how to voice snark comments and play the tsukkomi, Narumi pushes himself to his own limits and does everything in his power to protect those he truly cares for.<br />
<br />
tl;dr KamiMemo does some seriously incredible things with its characters. I won&#039;t even begin to mention just how perfectly amazing Alice is as a beautiful balance between a tsundere 12 year old and a calculated professional detective.<br />
<br />
KamiMemo was one of those &quot;love at first episode&quot; animes for me. It immediately gained a spot on my Top-10 anime list, and Alice became my 5th favorite character in all of anime. I was honestly impressed by the dynamic nature of basically every character. Even Alice grows and matures through the course of the anime, though remaining true to her detective creed and ideals. Watching the anime was simply a blast.<br />
<br />
Overall (9/10)<br />
The first season of KamiMemo covers volumes 1-4 of the light novel series. With 4 more volumes still untouched, I sincerely hope that somewhere on Heaven&#039;s Memo Pad is an entry for a season 2.

    When I heard that this anime would involve a detective-loli, I instantly had my suspicions. With Gosick being released the season before, however, I had already learned to swallow my pride and initial thoughts and bite the bullet. I enjoyed Gosick. The characters were likeable - except for Kujo - and the cases were coherent, but admittedly involved some ass-pullery from Victorique. Despite that, I still felt satisfied with how the cases went.<br />
<br />
Not with this one.<br />
<br />
In this one, the cases are sometimes so incoherent and rushed, that I actually have to make sure I didn&#039;t miss an episode. The cases seem to follow the same

          <span style="display: none;" id="review43259">
        format: 1-2 episodes used to introduce the case and key players within the case and 1 more on the end for Alice, by some ridiculous stretch, to solve the case by some obvious case point that the audience should have known as well. Well, I enjoy the detective genre of anime as much as the next guy, but in the ones that I truly like, the answer is never obvious, but it&#039;s there at any rate. Anything else that happened during the case? Left unexplained. This anime&#039;s &quot;obvious&quot; is just some data on Alice&#039;s screen.<br />
<br />
Ah...Alice. She&#039;s merely one of a bunch of unlikeable characters in the mix we have here. You&#039;ve heard of them all before, so let&#039;s introduce them all! We have...-drumroll-...the spineless male lead! The highschool friend who likes the invertebrate! The loli-detective! The tough guy with hidden soft spot! The tough bitch! The foreigner! And many more! Put them all together, and you get a swirling ball of WTF, like the Prisoner Horde in Demon&#039;s Souls; it makes no sense, they just flail around and it&#039;s ugly. This anime seems to pride itself on having a NEET based cast, probably no doubt &quot;Don&#039;t worry, watchers of this anime! You can be like this too!&quot;. Only we can&#039;t. Nor do we want to be. Moreover, it&#039;s almost a &quot;joy&quot; to guess to what Alice will spout her nonsense of &quot;I&#039;m not a normal detective. I&#039;m a NEET detective. I&#039;m a speaker of the dead blah blah blah&quot;. If I were a client of hers, it wouldn&#039;t strike me much confidence if she said that she was a speaker of the dead...I&#039;d rather have my detectives prevent crimes from causing me much personal harm, than be like a fire-inspection officer after the fire has started &quot;Oh yes...the fire started around this corner of the room. It seems that accelerants were use-&quot; &quot;That corner of the room is where I spoke to you, and the accelerants were when your guys decided to piss off the perps!&quot;.<br />
<br />
The art style and animation can&#039;t salvage this wreck from the bottom of the sea. All it can do is preserve the wreckage after it&#039;s being pulled out, just so we can all see why, quite clearly, why this anime&#039;s story, plot and characters are unlikeable. Sure, it can look quite marvelous, but the ship still won&#039;t be able to set sail; no matter how much I wish it would set sail and sink somewhere deeper in anime history.<br />
<br />
As with all things, some things will be liked by some people and others not. If you happen to like the major stereotypes that have plagued the anime industry for several years, then this anime is straight up your alley. However, with many other detective anime already showing the brilliance of the genre, this one&#039;s flaws and pitfalls are made even more evident. This one will just be another J.C. Staff Light Novel adaptation that is, surprisingly, par of the course for an extremely disappointing Summer 2011 season.

    The word &quot;NEET&quot; is used almost interchangeably with &quot;bum&quot; and &quot;hikikomori&quot; in Japan. KamiMemo is about NEET detective Alice and her so-called assistant Narumi solving various cases in Tokyo with the help of three other NEETs and a Yakuza group. While the premise and the main characters are strikingly similar to that of Gosick, they are very different shows in that KamiMemo is more about the drama than mystery.<br />
<br />
The story is arc-based with at most two characters for every case. This ensured great character development for the featured characters, which is the driving force behind this series. Unlike your typical detective show, the cases are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review44041">
        often simple. They&#039;re often very much solvable thanks to the abundance of hints planted throughout each arc. KamiMemo was far more engaging than Gosick to me as I found myself thinking about each incident with the characters rather than just watching a detective story presented to me. The downside of simple cases is that the story seems dull at times, though it makes up for it by adding drama and inspiration to the story.<br />
<br />
Despite being a detective anime, KamiMemo is filled with themes typically found in shounen (especially battle or sports) anime such as friendship, determination, justice/morality, belonging, search for a purpose in life, and love. There&#039;s also quite a bit of action, and like in the real life, many things are settled by brute force in the end rather than intelligence alone.<br />
<br />
The characters are rather stereotypical, but the anime spends a significant amount of time developing each person involved with each crime. Though Alice, Major, Hiro, and Tetsu were underdeveloped and functions almost exclusively as case solvers to advance the plot. The focus is on Narumi&#039;s growth as a person and clients of the NEET Investigation Firm. Their past, hopes, and desires are carefully presented to build up for the climaxes. While it can difficult to accept the corniness of Alice&#039;s speech and the convenience of the buildups at times, you are always rewarded with touching drama and inspiration by the end of each episode.<br />
<br />
The art and animation quality is absurdly high for a series of this type. Characters designs are very generic, but everything is detailed and maintains extraordinary consistency (even in a baseball filler episode). There are some sloppiness when characters are shown from distance, but this is only noticeable because of the amount of detail and fluidity in regular scenes. Overall, the visuals are far above par.<br />
OP/ED are very addictive songs that fit the show perfectly (I didn&#039;t even skip them!). Voicing is a perfect match for every character, and BGMs were decent.<br />
<br />
Episode 1 (double-length) was an original story specifically written for anime by the author of the novel, and in my opinion it was by far the best, most well thought out arc. I think this shows J.C. Staff&#039;s inability to properly pace and adapt novels. Everything was summarized pretty well in the final episode despite it being volume 1 out of 7 in the novels though. There were many instances where I felt the anime was saved by the inherent strength of its source material, but I found it to be very enjoyable overall.

    Kamisama no Memochou (God&#039;s Notebook) is one of the slightly darker &quot;high school mystery&quot; anime I have watched. It may not seem like it at first, but this anime is not as lighthearted as something like Hyouka. Hyouka doesn&#039;t have anything like suicide attempts, money stolen from the yakuza, or mind-altering drugs.<br />
<br />
Story - 7/10<br />
<br />
The only real problem with the story of Kamisama no Memochou is it&#039;s slow and cliche start. The first four episodes are really nothing special, but after that, the latter two slightly longer arcs that make up the remaining 8 episodes are almost as good of mystery arcs as some of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review106387">
        Death Note arcs.<br />
<br />
The story follows Fujishima Narumi. At the beginning, Narumi&#039;s nothing more than your usual male protagonist who is somewhat forced into an uncomfortable situation (he seems and looks a lot like Ryugamine Mikado from Durarara at first). Narumi&#039;s father works abroad for all but around 5 days out of the year, so he lives with his older sister who works to support both of them. Because of this, he is forced to move around often, has changed schools many times over the years, and has become used to moving and avoids making many friends. One day, he is up on the roof of his current school in Tokyo when a girl named Ayaka sees him. She is the single member of the Gardening Club and is growing plants on the roof.<br />
<br />
After forcing Narumi to join the Gardening Club, she takes him to a ramen shop which is where she works occasionally and where a group of NEETs (people who are not employed, in education, or training) meet. Narumi is welcomed into the group despite stating that he is not a NEET and has no intention of becoming one. The three NEETs are all there because they are working for the NEET detective, Alice, who lives in a room above the ramen shop (which is her main supply of food as well).<br />
<br />
Alice is an introverted detective with incredible hacking and computer skills who loves stuffed animals and a soda called Dokupe (which is clearly not advertising for Dr. Pepper).<br />
<br />
From there, the group is involved in several cases (as I mentioned, the first few are a little boring). Eventually Narumi gets more involved with the group and becomes more of a leader who has the respect of the other NEETs and a gang who is closely tied to the group of NEETs.<br />
<br />
Trust me, if you don&#039;t completely hate the beginning of the show, don&#039;t give up on it before Episode 5. The story really picks up then and Narumi starts becoming a much more interesting character.<br />
<br />
Art - 7/10<br />
<br />
Alice&#039;s room looks really great with the computer lighting and stuffed animals and the very final scene of the show looks spectacular, but other than that, the art is mostly average. It&#039;s set in a city, which is drawn well, but I think Durarara and Death Note (which have similar settings) have much better art.<br />
<br />
The character designs are also similar to other characters (I mentioned before Narumi looks like a copy of Mikado with brown hair instead of black). Alice is your typical &quot;loli with long hair&quot; female lead as far as looks go. About the only design that stands out is Hirasaka Renji&#039;s due to his odd, dyed blond bangs which make him look more like a Yugioh character than someone fitting in with the rest of these more normal looking characters. I actually really liked his design since it was so unique and interesting.<br />
<br />
Sound - 5/10<br />
<br />
There&#039;s no problems with the Japanese voice acting, but the soundtrack is a little strange. It&#039;s usually not even noticeable (with the OP and ED [I don&#039;t include them in the score] overshadowing almost everything). There are a few good tracks, but there is also one weird &quot;song&quot; which sounds like a woman saying some words in English with long pauses in between each word. There&#039;s not much other than that that I remember.<br />
<br />
Character - 8/10<br />
<br />
I thought the characters at first were just a bunch of bland copy characters from other shows, but they really had some good development that changed my mind completely around 7 or 8 episodes in. I didn&#039;t think Alice ever really developed much, but she was interesting from the beginning so that&#039;s not really a problem.<br />
<br />
Narumi is definitely the most developed character in this show. Despite his whole reason for getting involved in this story being pretty cliche, he really does a good job and actually turns into a good leader. Several characters mention that he should become a con man, which I could see happening in his future if he wasn&#039;t so nice (though he has a nice breakdown later on).<br />
<br />
Hinamura Souichirou (Hina) is also an interesting character. He doesn&#039;t necessarily develop, but he has a really good role in the first &quot;good&quot; arc. Hina is a gang leader with an extremely loyal group of followers. He can be very intimidating and strong when he wants to, but he is also kindhearted and has a very interesting backstory. He works with Alice and the other NEETs a lot and forms a strange bond with Narumi.<br />
<br />
The other NEETs who help Alice are Tetsuo, who is skilled at boxing, Hitoshi, a skilled hacker who looks like an elementary school kid, and Hiroaki, a gigolo who uses his female connections as a wide source of information around the city. Along with them is Ayaka, who is only occasionally involved in the cases (the last one has a lot to do with her) and mostly just helps by working at the ramen shop and making sure Alice bathes.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 7/10<br />
<br />
While this anime gets off to a very slow start, it really picks up around Episode 5 and becomes a good, fairly dark mystery anime. The characters become much better after that point and just the overall arcs and story becomes much more unique. While there isn&#039;t really any overarching plot aside from Narumi&#039;s development, it&#039;s just interesting to watch as the story progresses. Kamisama no Memochou does a good job of pulling you into the NEET detective world it sets up in Tokyo and connects you to the characters slowly throughout the 12 episodes. Some similar shows would be the more lighthearted Hyouka while Durarara and Death Note have similar settings and some similar characters (Alice and L are kind of similar detectives who spend most of their time inside). Shindere Shoujo to Kodoku na Shinigami is a manga with a similar balance of comedy, drama, and somewhat dark mystery.<br />
<br />
I would recommend this manga if you like mystery anime at all. It may start out slow, but it&#039;s rewarding to stick it out until it starts becoming more unique around halfway through.

    To be honest, this anime is another one that present only moe and nothing else, and its worse than K-On as how its supposed to be a detective anime. The &#039;detective-ness&#039; it gives is dull, so it fail to fulfill its goal as a detective anime and not like how K-On have achieved its purpose of being mass of simple moe and nothing else.<br />
<br />
The girl named Alice, while many would find her cute and attractive, I find her terribly annoying and illogical. She said she had observed the world from her screen, which with that meaning that she have witnessed countless crimes and tragedies, yet

          <span style="display: none;" id="review42679">
        she will make a crying face when she unintentionally broke her chopsticks. Her intelligence did not meet up with her arrogance and demands at all as she couldn&#039;t figure out some obvious facts and have Narumi, a dumb average Mr.Mundane solve it for her, and she&#039;s supposed to be a genius detective right? And at the conclusion of ep1 she chose Narumi to be her personal assistance despite having other acquaintances she had worked cases with before(so maybe the ep1 case was their first case and Alice and team have never solved any crime before? oh they might be too busy setting up cameras around the city and work jobs to pay for all the cameras and screens, along with the massive electricity bill Alice devour each day maybe? That may be a logical answer to why she need Narumi, she couldn&#039;t solve stuffs herself like she&#039;s already supposed to be able to prior to the story), and lastly, the name &#039;Alice&#039; is simply the most overused name of all Japanese fiction media, the reference to Alice in Wonderland now became non-existent and so the name can apply to all girls that lives in their dreamy room or have any relation with either literal, emotional or figurative fantasy, and it is not only getting old, but already had.<br />
<br />
Lastly at the conclusion of ep1 they still didn&#039;t tell why the victim girl committed suicide. Yeah you might say its given that the girl was too pressured with life so she decided to die, that&#039;s really retarded, she was regarded as the &#039;perfect female of the school&#039;, if she can&#039;t handle it and yet have enough free time to get money from prostitution, keep a healthy relationship with a male and female friend separately, and along with keeping her &#039;perfectness&#039; up, why not just yell at all those people pressuring her and loosen the valve to the point she can handle it? With that much given free time it should&#039;ve been so easy, and if she was smart enough to do well in school she should&#039;ve figured that out.

    Kamisama no Memochou is an amazing anime that shows how a little girl can solve different cases. Age does no really matter in being a detective. You just need good observation skills and the wits. ;) The main character really has a high pride about herself.. She is not just a detective... She is a NEET detective. ^^ I really liked this anime and the characters.. :D<br />

    First of all, I don&#039;t write reviews. I just watch the anime, take note of it, put a score on it, and remember it if was good. The fact that I&#039;m writing this is quite important. <br />
<br />
Now I gave this a 10. <br />
<br />
Story: 10<br />
I had just finished watching &quot;The Mentalist&quot;, a television show about crime and mystery, with comedy in between. So landing on Kamisama no Memochou was great for me. I was able to enjoy the story because, like &quot;The Mentalist&quot; the story was well thought out. The story starts and follows the general mystery solving format that makes it good. First, recognition of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review193881">
        the crime, planning, first scouting, planning, first action, and then the reveal. Or something like that. I really appreciate that the series takes ~40 minutes to start and end a mystery. This shows that Alice and the detective squad are really well at what they do. Now of course there were stories that took longer than 2 episodes. These stories...omg they were awesome. Each scene exists for a purpose in the development of the detective skills. Each scene progresses the MC and the viewer ahead and also allows us to find the personalities of the characters involved. For a story that is deep, proper, and meticulous in the way the mysteries are solved I really liked it. <br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
I&#039;m too picky about the art style since I understand each studio follows their own way of drawing. So every now and then I pause the episode to notice the detail in a frame. The art was well, nothing lazy. Sure, a few frames had simple drawing but nothing that would remove from the show a lot. Everything that needed focus had detail and that&#039;s all that mattered.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8 <br />
Again, sound is great if it matters and if it doesn&#039;t then it&#039;s just another thing for the acoustic value in a scene. I like anime such as Kill La Kill and Katanagatari in the way they use a special song or tune for a certain type of situation or character (s/o to Blumenkranz for Ragyo). I noticed that in this anime there are a few empty scenes with no BGM. Otherwise there is something to fill the airwaves. And then there are a few reoccuring songs to match a situation, and I really liked that. I.e. when Alice explains something, a really cool female vocalization song starts in the background and adds a special intensity. <br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
Never get your characters wrong. I really liked how the characters in each crime were explained in a nice and detailed way. Sure, some of them were regular characters that already existed in our knowledge before they make their &quot;request&quot; but still...characters that stay for a short time or have importance for a short time still get enough presentation to show themselves to the viewers. Characters with longer importance are slowly revealed to the viewers. And I liked that. The pacing of revealing the backstories of characters was great. There were a few episodes just to reveal the backstories of two characters, and another single episode to reveal the story of another. Each was very well presented. The NEETs are highlighted for their abilities, and they&#039;re &quot;powers&quot; are constant, no deus ex machina here. I really like the MC because he isn&#039;t the dense type and he is smart in his own way. His pairing with Alice is great too and in that way the viewers get the inside scoop on what she is thinking because, as they point out in the anime a lot, the MC is talker and not a thinker. The reason why I think the characters aren&#039;t super awesome is because, well the author uses concepts so out of the norm that it becomes unique...and that hurts it a little. Near the end I saw the MC become a little different and succumb to the generic MC style where &quot;he is weak and confused but now he is strong, but isn&#039;t always strong...just when he wants to be&quot; and that was annoying to me because I really hoped the anime wouldn&#039;t end like that.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
Like I said, I just finished watching 7 season of &quot;The Mentalist&quot; in which I thoroughly enjoyed. Coming to this only helped extend the enjoyment I had in that show and so seeing the pacing of this anime and how there was a smart character who didn&#039;t do much, and a not as smart character who ran around a lot helped me relate back to &quot;The Mentalist&quot;. For anyone who hasn&#039;t seen the show I&#039;m talking about...well if you like to think a little in an anime and like a bit of problem solving and connecting the dots...I think you&#039;ll like this too.

    Kamisama no Memochou is an action/coming of age story about a young man in high school who is swept up into working for a detective agency headed up by a young girl (Alice) with extraordinary computer skills. She&#039;s more Victorique (GOSICK) than Sherlock Holmes, but she has a crew of NEET helpers who do the grunt work and she puts those pieces together with what she can find by either hacking databases or accessing surveillance cameras.<br />
<br />
This is not a moe series, nor does it try to be. Yes, Alice is demi-kawaii and demi-tsundere, but as the series continues, she doesn&#039;t have that much screen-time. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review42763">
        stories focus on the protagonist, Narumi, and how he manages to help those around him and become stronger in the process.<br />
<br />
The series is solid in terms of production values, with good sound, art, and writing. The OP &amp; ED are a bit lack-luster, though that&#039;s offset by the fact that the incidental music is really effective at times.<br />
<br />
The comedic timing is good and the side-characters are interesting enough that you find yourself wishing that they had more screen time. Not all the cases/resolutions are serious and that gives the show a bit of an uneven feel, but it&#039;s not enough to take away from the enjoyment of the more serious arcs.<br />
<br />
One of the biggest bonuses for me in this series (so far) has been watching minor characters emerge into significant and important roles. I haven&#039;t read the manga and the series hasn&#039;t concluded yet, and that will be the real test, whether they can pull all the threads together into an emotionally torturous and yet satisfying ending. If they manage that, I may upgrade my rating. For now, I&#039;m going to wait, watch and see.

    Story: 5<br />
The story shoots between complete predictability and utter nonsense. I still don&#039;t understand how the protagonist ended up as &quot;assistant&quot; to the detective other than &quot;Oh since you don&#039;t have anything else better to do with your time, be my assistant.&quot;<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
The art is about the only thing going for it. It&#039;s well made. Then again, what isn&#039;t these days?<br />
<br />
Sound: 6<br />
The voices are ok. The op and ed are boring.<br />
<br />
Character: 3<br />
<br />
I have no idea what is going through the characters minds. The detective calls herself a NEET, but since she works as a detective, she is technically employed. Why did the protagonist join the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review43045">
        yakuza? Are they yakuza?<br />
The behavior of the characters is confusing and nonsensical. Easily the low point of this show.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5<br />
<br />
I was so confused I could not follow almost anything that was happening. I mean, following one episode was one thing, but I for a show with arcs, they did not play off each other very well.<br />
<br />
Overall: 5<br />
<br />
The show gets a 5 (Mediocre) for its overall score. Descent art is brought down with a lackluster story and poor character development. Not really worth the time.

    Kami-sama no Memochou (God&#039;s notebook) is a must-see series.  Bottom line.<br />
<br />
Like any series, it is hard to be hooked in right from the start, but there are dozens, literally, HUNDREDS of animes that start off that way but are now beloved by millions.  This short 12-episode series is among them.<br />
<br />
As the story progresses, it keeps throwing you cliffhangers that make you want to see another episode and another and another and then BOOM!  PLOT TWIST!!!!!  TRAGEDIES!!! CONSPIRACIES!!!  DRUGS!!! GANG WARS!!!  EVERYTHING IS MOVING SO FAST!!!  The writing for this show got really intense midway through.  <br />
<br />
And even

    Kami-sama no Memo-chou  is not a typical mystery anime when the &quot;detective character&quot; seems to be a little like Sherlock. This anime is about &quot;NEETS&quot; or school drop outs that take requests from clients who need help in finding someone or figuring out why someone did something. Each of the characters in this anime have distinct personalities, some with the typical norms in other characters such as Alice; typical Gothic loli who is a bit of a tsundere - She is quite similar to the girl in Gosick.  <br />
<br />
Considering how short the anime is it has a great story line and  you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review171007">
        can really get into it, I love this anime, the art is lovely, the characters are great and the story is good too. I love how the characters developed over the 12 episodes and how the anime hits home in reality and things that can happen in real life.  <br />
<br />
This review is not very detailed due to spoilers and to be honest I am not good at typing reviews at all but I hope it at least helped a bit.

    Overall [9/10]<br />
This was.... amazing. Throw away the typical geniuses (although the characters are in their own way) and place people who decide to find something better in the world in a different ways.<br />
Plot [8/10]<br />
The plot may seem a bit of a lackluster at first but before you know it, you&#039;re stuck in their loop, unable to tear your eyes away from the screen. Watch the protagonist go from someone who barely interacted with anyone and threw around fake smiles to one of immeasurable power and find his own worth, neither exaggerated nor underestimated. Narumi was heartbreakingly human.<br />
Character [9/10]<br />
Alice; the speaker of the dead. While uncovering,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190048">
        she shoulders the burden that she could have done something had she been earlier, but she always reaches one scene too late.<br />
Renji, Hiro and Master; seeing the world with different eyes through connections and technology, usually indirect than direct.<br />
Sou... the anti-hero in the story. Doing things that people in full view of the public cannot, bring justice his own way even if its outlawed.<br />
Narumi... the high school student that wanted to find the bigger picture, something bigger than life and found it in words he spoke and wrote.<br />
The main cast were beautiful and flawed in their own ways, so I loved them all, even the supposed villains who were also trying to find their own place.<br />
<br />
In general, I love this anime ;)

    Kamisama no Memouchou (God&#039;s Memo Pad) is a story about a boy who meets a girl, and in turn meets a group of NEETs led by Alice, the ultimate NEET detective who solves multiple crimes and mysteries in the city with little more than just her set of computers in front of her. It is short, so the maximum score that I can give this anime is 8 points, 8 points being the perfect 13-episode anime (such as Angel Beats!). 2 points are automatically deducted from both/either story and/or character respectively, since it is virtually impossible to produce a complete story and comprehensive character development

Plot: 5/10<br />
<br />
The anime starts off like the usual - introduction of a kid in school called Narumi, who is quickly thrust into this NEET worlds, which becomes very interesting in the subsequent few episodes when they managed to solve the case of a murder. That&#039;s all fine and good. They also manage to solve a crime regarding misappropriation of funds, okay, that&#039;s the end of the first part, aka introduction to the life of Alice and her group of NEETs.<br />
<br />
The second main arc describes the ongoing conflict between Sou and his long-lost friend, Renji, who fell out a long time ago due to a misunderstanding over a fatal incident. This particular arc I had alot of problems with. First of all, the relationship between Narumi and Renji was kind of boring. All they did was talk a bit here and there, meet up here and there, and poof they are sworn brothers. But not really, they still don&#039;t really know each other very well.<br />
<br />
The other problem was that the entire conflict seemed too insignificant to invest a good 4 episodes into it. Two rivals who were once friends, fight in the midst a Feketerigo concert that is backed by the shadowy underground Hirasaka group, just because of a misunderstanding that they probably could have cleared up if they just talked. Nice twist at the end about the true fate of Hison after the stabbing, though. Still, it makes hardly any sense for two rivals to nearly try to kill each other over something that Souchirou obviously knows is a misunderstanding. They honestly are not taking this friendship thing too seriously.<br />
<br />
Jump to the third main arc about the Angel Fix, and I must say, it was a pretty gripping plotline, albeit with tons of plotholes. Wait, so the police couldn&#039;t find out exactly where this drug was coming from and had to leave it to the NEET detectives to solve it? What the heck are the police doing anyway, they didnt even show up in the anime - oh wait, I believe Hirasaka group was standing in for the police. Ah that explains it.... Anyway, the other main problem was when they dramatically HAD NO CHOICE but to make Narumi take the Angel Fix drug, potentially risking death, in order to find the bad guy&#039;s hideout (and by the way, he even issued a challenge, so confident that it would not be found).<br />
<br />
Hang on a second, it&#039;s all really touching but couldn&#039;t they have just trailed ANOTHER angel fix user? I mean, it&#039;s widespread right, there&#039;s absolutely got to be a chance to get hold of AT LEAST ONE OTHER angel fix user around the ENTIRE town! Oh well, even Alice didn&#039;t think of that. And the next thing, So Angel Fix users follow their &quot;illusions&quot; and this illusion somehow leads them to black alleys. I know hallucinations and drugs come hand in hand, but it&#039;s not technically possible to use a hallucination as a GPS/navigation system, especially since it&#039;s not possible to control exactly WHEN or WHERE the user takes it, and hallucinations often differ from person to person.<br />
<br />
It started off well, was shaky in the middle, but ultimately managed to get off some flawed but at least touching story at the end. On the whole, the story was mediocre. There was also no main overarching story throughout, it was more like many separate events, with only two main big ones. I gave 2 points for the last arc and 1 point for the second arc, 2 points for the first introductory arc.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
<br />
Art was definitely top-notch. I loved the OP and ED scenes, they were all so beautifully designed. Character designs were pretty neat too, they were all unique and there weren&#039;t two characters that were visually alike in every way.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
<br />
One of the best music tracks I&#039;ve heard in a while. The OP and ED track were both absolutely amazing, and completely drew me to love the anime. Also, background music a suitable and was tense at the right moments.<br />
<br />
Character: 7/10<br />
<br />
Here we go again. Another random kid who wants to do his best. It&#039;s the typical shounen character who meets the typical tsundere. Oh wait, no, actually they are not THAT typical.<br />
<br />
Narumi may look like the same old clueless dude that seems to be what all main characters sound like in all school-related animes, but he really isn&#039;t. He doesn&#039;t whine or be useless as often, and most of the time his determination and strength allows him to find out things that other characters miss. Hence, he is more than just a guy who receives growth from the other characters, he contributes to the team as well, and even early on.<br />
<br />
Then we come to Alice, who yes, is kind of stereotypical, but actually she&#039;s kind of cute. I love it when she blushes and I love how she calls all of her soft toys names (lol what kind of name is Moggadeet?). And as an avid lover of computers, it&#039;s a wonder she doesn&#039;t need to wear spectacles when she sits 30 cm away from 6 computer screens and just stares at them the entire day. She&#039;s abit useless though - I cant&#039; really imagine someone not being able to open a drink can, yet being able to swing a bat (yep that&#039;s inconsistency right there).<br />
<br />
The other characters, besides maybe Ayaka (main character in arc 3) and Sou/Renji/Yoshiki (main characters in arc 2), unfortunately, are sadly sidelined despite their awesomeness. You have Major, who is the genius inventor from college whom you unfortunately, after watching till the end of the show, have no idea where he comes from or whether he actually has a family. Next, you have Tetsu, whom you pretty much also don&#039;t know anything about. Then you have Hiro, the playboy whose promiscuity makes you wonder why he doesn&#039;t have aids yet.<br />
<br />
Actually, if you think harder about it, you don&#039;t really know where Alice comes from either - how did she get so smart? How old is she even? Let&#039;s look at Ayaka - sure her dark past is intertwined with her brothers&#039; but what about her interactions with other friends? Couldn&#039;t she at least have confided with some of her classmates, she must have some OTHER relationship other than that with Narumi. Her past? Umm... I don&#039;t really know. Other family members maybe? Only Sou/Yoshiki, I felt had any real substantial back story to them, but Yoshiki herself, had some lack in her story, since she wasn&#039;t a main character.<br />
<br />
So in the end, while there is character growth, this is shown ONLY in Narumi, everyone else seems the same start to end, with a little growth in Sou/Alice regarding how useful Narumi is. Character background and development is greatly lacking in most characters, as most of them have linear/monofaceted personalities.<br />
<br />
Minus 1 point in growth, 2 points for lack of characterization. But the interactions between the characters are generally good, enjoyable, funny, touching, emotional and genuine. So at least, I applaud for that. The ending part was quite touching, Ayaka x Narumi is quite the destined pair.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6/10<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t rate this very high on the enjoyment scale, because I had to bring myself to watch through the middle segment of the show, rather than be so hooked that I HAD to watch it. I would have been fine with dropping the series halfway because it started to get slightly uninteresting. But, pretty distinct, strong personalities with interesting quirks and interactions, made the series quite enjoyable overall.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6/10<br />
<br />
This is actually not too bad. It&#039;s two points off full marks. While it didn&#039;t fail to deliver a complete and satisfying resolution, it failed to properly fit into any real genre I could think of. I have a feeling it was going for this &quot;Mystery&quot; thing, but honestly, it llacked a lot of suspense.

    When I saw the list of Summer animes, I was interested in this! So when I found out the episode was out already I was overjoyed! Though I was shocked to see it longer than usual (40 something minutes) .. I&#039;ll keep this short and simple because I&#039;ve only watched one episode  but I agree with roriconfan&#039;s recommendation.<br />
<br />
The potential is there but the actual anime is not. The motivation for me to watch this cute loli was because of the twist of being a &quot;NEET&quot; (my first time experience in having a main character like that). Though as it progressed, I was losing my

          <span style="display: none;" id="review39006">
        interest but the thing that kept me strong was the interest I had for this and the case being solved! <br />
<br />
At the end, I was disappointed. The crime was very simple but it seemed like no one knew why the girl disappeared or her motives. Even if it was said it to her best friend (in the flash back) and when they find it, it&#039;s like OMG WHAT HAPPENED? Probably the most interesting concept of this entire thing was how they found her and the quote POSSIBLE SPOILER:  &quot;I wish time could stay frozen like this forever&quot;  The anime doesn&#039;t let you know much while trying to solve the mystery but Alice (our loli) knows all. This anime ... (I hate comparing but...) was like Gosick but worse. The pairing, the mystery of it all, but the twist of technology and NEET-ness. Was the very end a bit of fanservice? That I was disappointed it. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ll watch out for the next episode because I still like the concept  but I&#039;m possibly dropping this one from my anime list. ;c

    I am a fan of detective-like stories. And being a NEET myself, I can somehow relate here to Alice. And just as she said<br />
<br />
&quot;I have been gazing through windows across the internet to see the world. A grossly limited and twisted world, isn&#039;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyway, I just finished seeing this anime. Knowing it&#039;s been completed quite a while back, I&#039;ve only got the time to watch it recently. And I&#039;m glad to have watched this series. It got me really satisfied with all the turn of events.<br />
<br />
This was another series that got me really hooked up from the very first episode up to the last. if

          <span style="display: none;" id="review55297">
        only I could watch it continuously without stopping, I might have.<br />
<br />
Story: Great stories. There are some episodes that kinda throw me off a bit. Like I would have thought to myself &quot;seriously, this is just a stupid kind of case. you just wasted an episode!&quot; But after sometime, things began to get interesting once more. Yeah, the story was just your typical detective story there is. But it has something that not all detective stories have. It has a great plot. Something that&#039;s continuously progressing until you reach the very conclusion of it. every episode has deeper meanings than just seeing it. It&#039;s like you don&#039;t have to watch it with your own eyes and just enjoy the episode or get bored by it. You have to watch it very seriously, carefully, chewing every words, digesting every information and let the conclusion not just stir your brains but your very emotions as well.<br />
<br />
Art is Good. typical art. Not very catchy but at least it doesn&#039;t hurt the eyes.<br />
<br />
Characters are quite great. they have really different characters being portrayed. Not everyone is similar. Really unique individuals that found each other and formed a bond. Well, that&#039;s how things are but then there was not an annoying character ever in the whole series.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment, well yeahh I actually enjoyed the whole series. Like I said, I am a fan of detective type stories.<br />
<br />
Over all: This is just a great anime. Totally love everything about it. And the ending is beautifully written and portrayed. A bit sad, yeahh but the kind of sadness that doesn&#039;t really hurt. Two thumbs up.<br />
<br />
This might be below the belt/crossing the line but those who rated this anime low might have watched this only with their eyes. They didn&#039;t savor every moment and maybe didn&#039;t really get the true meaning behind the story.<br />
 But then, every people has their own opinions, so I&#039;m not one to talk.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!

    Imagine a riding a rollercoaster. It starts off by building up your excitement as you are slowly ascending the tracks while, at the same time, speeding up. The rest of the ride then consists of ups and downs, loops and turns, and random spins, before ending with a final surge of exhilarating speed. That is how I felt when watching Kami-sama no Memo-chou. The first episode made the series seem promising but it eventually failed to deliver, despite having a decent ending. Let&#039;s see how it fared in the usual four categories of art, character, sound and story. <br />
<br />
Art (7/10)<br />
Animation quality usually takes a backseat

          <span style="display: none;" id="review47567">
        to the characters and the story when I watch anime. However, when those two categories end up being bland and uninteresting, I am forced to focus on other aspects of the episode just to prevent myself from being bored out of my mind. The artwork in Kami-sama no Memo-chou isn&#039;t outstanding, but it isn&#039;t horrible either - just your typical run-of-the-mill quality. Nothing more to say here so let&#039;s move on. <br />
<br />
Characters (6/10)<br />
Maybe a 6 is a bit generous for this category because, at the end of it all, I couldn&#039;t really say that there was a character that I &quot;liked&quot;, unlike in most anime that I watched. Yes, there was some character development, but there wasn&#039;t enough for my liking. My image of the main protagonist, Fujishima Narumi, didn&#039;t change at all throughout the whole show; he was still a plain and boring character to me, for the most part. On top of this, I slightly disliked Alice and her personality. The previous sentences are, however, just my opinion so you may not necessarily agree. However, I do believe that I&#039;m not the only one who feels this way. Non-memorable side characters make this category suffer even more. To sum it all up, the characters in Kami-sama no Memo-chou are nothing to be happy about, so don&#039;t expect a lot if you are someone who pays a lot of attention to character development. <br />
<br />
Sound (7/10)<br />
Once again another generous mark is given, this time to the sound category (it may seem like I&#039;m starting to pity the anime and that&#039;s probably the case). Aside from the OP, everything was just &quot;decent.&quot; The ED, BGM and voice acting were, at best, average. With that being said, I admit all my expectations were lowered drastically midway through so this category should technically receive a lower score than what it currently has. Anyhow, I found the OP to be the lone bright spot in terms of sound. Kawaru Mirai only took a few episodes to get me like it. It is upbeat and catchy with surprisingly good vocals to go along with it. You can say that half of my motivation to download and watch each episode was because of the OP. <br />
<br />
Story (7/10)<br />
One may choose to say that, if the story is able to overshadow everything, bad art, characters and sounds can be excused. However, this is unfortunately not the case for Kami-sama no Memo-chou as the story is just as bad as the other categories. Maybe it won&#039;t seem that way after the first episode, but as the series went on, the story definitely didn&#039;t live up to the expectations of many viewers. There were some parts which were surprisingly interesting while others were absolutely horrid. Looking at the big picture, I personally didn&#039;t feel that the plot advanced far enough. For a 12-episode season, the story moved way too slowly with barely anything important happening. It is only during the last few episodes that the plot was developed the most. Overall, a disappointing story. <br />
<br />
Overall (7/10)<br />
Kami-sama no Memo-chou is a good example of a light novel adaption gone wrong. Average artwork, boring characters, unimpressive sounds and a disappointing story just screams &quot;don&#039;t waste your time!&quot; While I don&#039;t want to scare people away from watching it, I would just like to give a word of warning to those who are not sure if they should watch it for not. By all means, go try it if you have nothing better to do or like &quot;mystery&quot; anime. Whether you agree or disagree with me at the end of it all is totally up to you. All I will say is this: while it is supposedly a &quot;mystery&quot; anime, Kami-sama no Memo-chou is undoubtedly unable to reach the level of success that big titles such as Detective Conan have. Don&#039;t expect too much.

    Kamisama no Memochou (Heaven&#039;s Memo Pad) has really good art and character design. The animations by J.C. Staff once again are on par with shows like Railgun and Index the environment design especially are great however the story is dreadful and doesn&#039;t even make sense half the time. I was truely disappointed by this such a good art style and character design yet such a shit and terrible story. If your looking for a 12 ep filler because your bored or have nothing else to do its worth watching however if you are wanting some good story and enjoyment don&#039;t go anywhere near this shit

    Kamisama no Memochou is not an anime for you if you&#039;re looking for real detective-mystery. It deals with relationships between the characters and the problems they face, which the loli detective solves for them. If you don&#039;t like lolis, rest assured, there is more emphasis on the reckless main character, the people around him and the yakuza.<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
Decent story, good concept. I like how the story turns from loli to yakuza and brotherhood. There are different arcs which are all interesting. The last two arcs were especially interesting.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
Good animation, thankfully, the characters didn&#039;t look like kids. The animation is smooth enough.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
Voice acting was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190267">
        good, opening was a big disappointment (I listened to it every episode and I still forgot how it went). The ending was okay. The background music was really good.<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
Other than the irritating tsundere loli, all characters were really good. Thankfully, the main character is reckless but not an idiot. There are many cool male characters and also a lot of character development between each character. There are less female characters but they, too, were good.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
I thought it was boring until episode 5. But later, it was all about yakuza and promises. Then it went into drugs and a lot of other things. <br />
<br />
Overall: I&#039;d say 6.5 something but I&#039;ll give it a 7<br />
It was rated less, even though I praised it this much because it didn&#039;t turn out to be a good mystery anime. I can say, Kamisama no Memochou has more drama than mystery. Nothing is so mysterious about it. Being a huge mystery fan, this was a let down. It&#039;s worth watching but I wouldn&#039;t watch it again.<br />
Give it a try.<br />
<br />

    Heaven&#039;s Memo Pad may seem like a noteworthy anime at first glance. I mean, the concept is a fairly interesting one. A bunch of NEET&#039;s spending their days solving mysteries? I for one, found this to be an intriguing premise, and as several fans of the show compared it to the excellent Durarara!! and the somewhat disappointing but still decent Eden of the East, I pre-ordered this show and couldn&#039;t wait to watch it. Imagine then my disappointment when I finished the last episode, only to feel cheated, angry, and somewhat sad as just how much of a missed opportunity this show turned out to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review133395">
        be.<br />
<br />
I could go into depth about each and every single character, but I really don&#039;t see any point to it, as not a single one of them has anything noteworthy about their personalities or designs that make them stand out in the slightest from your stereotypical slice-of-life anime, not at all helped by how overly sexualized every single female character is in this show. The main protagonist Narumi Fujishima may be the most whiny, self-righteous hypocrite I have ever seen in an anime. This is made ten times worse by the fact that every single character in the show seems to worship the ground he walks on. Not that the rest of the cast is any better. Yes, even the much revered Alice, the heroine of the show, fails to be memorable in the slightest. This isn&#039;t entirely because the character herself is bad per say, as I&#039;ll admit she is at least somewhat better than the rest of the awful cast this show has. It&#039;s rather because the show prefers to show her being a stereotypical tsundere crying because her teddybear got dirty than ever actually showing her intellect, which we are told about at least thrice every episode, but never get to witness first-hand. She&#039;s supposed to be an ace-detective and master hacker, yet we never ONCE see her actually conduct any research or get to see her thought-process when solving a crime. Rather, she just tells us how the crime was done, and then it&#039;s back to showing her getting scared because the lights went out.<br />
<br />
Now, this wouldn&#039;t be such a big problem if it wasn&#039;t for how seriously the show takes itself. More than once I found myself surprised at just how deeply the show wanted me to care for a character I had just been introduced to. Or other times, it would show just how &quot;close&quot; Narumi was with a person he had met twice, and hardly even gotten along with at first, before suddenly having no qualms about sacrificing his own life for that person. This is only made worse by how poorly told most of the &quot;mysteries&quot; are, which range from being mediocre to flat-out offensive, but I&#039;ll get to that in a second.<br />
<br />
The &quot;mysteries&quot; themselves are often not even mysteries at all, and instead of actually giving the viewer the necessary clues to solving the crime on their own, the show rather purposefully HIDES information from the viewer until the last second where they will quickly explain the mystery in a way that makes it seem like even the writers of the show have lost interest and just want to explain it quickly and be done with it. Each episode often ends with an incredibly cliched and boring &quot;philosophical&quot; (and I&#039;m using this term loosely) monologue which only serves to hammer in the point the episode very obviously is trying to get across. Most of these points are either incredibly obvious, or just downright stupid, but it wouldn&#039;t be such a problem if the show didn&#039;t constantly shove this point down your throat just to make absolutely sure that you get it.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of other problems with the show as well, like the mediocre voice-acting, the forgettable soundtrack or the cliche script. But by far the biggest problem the show has, is just how UNINSPIRED it feels. This show claims to be about NEET&#039;s, showing the society that scorns them just how much they are capable of, yet it&#039;s hardly ever brought up, much less focused on. Alice is the only NEET in the entire show with any importance whatsoever, and even then it&#039;s not as if the show actually discusses this matter at all. Not a single character ever looks down upon or even seems to care that she is a NEET, nor does it add anything to the story. The writers or the show could have easily cut out the fact that she and some of her friends are NEET&#039;s, and the story would not be altered in the slightest.<br />
<br />
The other topics the show focuses on, like prostitution, drug-addiction and gang wars are all horribly presented, and obviously written by people who have no knowledge or understanding of any of these topics. The gang war is portrayed in such a black and white manner it borders on being comical, and the shows portrayal of drug-addicts is so biased and ignorant it is bordering on being offensive. The show portrays drug-addicts as literal scum, people with no sympathetic traits whatsoever, only looking to hurt others and get high, because as we all know, drug-addicts are all evil and hate everything good in the world. Having known several people whom have struggled with drug-abuse, I can&#039;t say how distasteful this show portrays drug-addiction and it&#039;s victims. The entire moral of the &quot;drug-arc&quot; seems to be that all people who do drugs are evil, and they should be scorned rather than helped. Honestly, as if the show didn&#039;t do enough wrong already, it will now try to force a very ignorant message on it&#039;s viewers when it&#039;s crystal clear the writers of this show have no knowledge on the subject.<br />
<br />
Despite how much I&#039;ve ranted, not every little thing about this show is terrible. The show does have some decent animation, and while it fails to deliver any of what it promises, it does, if nothing else, at least have the potential to be good. Had the show been given more time to establish it&#039;s characters and storylines, as well as being written by more talented writers, I have no doubt this could have been a good, if not even great show. As it currently stands however, it is not a show I would really recommend to anyone, no matter their preferences, as there are much better shows that go into a lot of the same subjects as Heaven&#039;s Memo Pad, like Durarara!! or Paranoia Agent, and unlike Heaven&#039;s Memo Pad, they are written by people whom seem to actually know what they are talking about. If none of my arguments have shaken your resolve to watch this anime, at least be wise enough to watch it online first to be absolutely sure you actually want to PAY someone for this drivel. Your hard earned-cash is better spent elsewhere.
