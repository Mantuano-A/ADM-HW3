    &quot;Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that? We must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing, at whatever cost, must be attained.&quot; - Marie Curie<br />

Everyone wants a second chance in life, amirite? Whether is it to resuscitate loved ones that could&#039;ve a chance to live if not for reckless decisions made internally or externally, or to amend for mistakes done so badly that he/she falls out of grace from their passion at life? Well, look no further than Bokutachi no Remake a.k.a Remake our Life!: the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418231">
        fortunate pairing of one of the best AniManga tropes ever seen on the face of the earth (which is time travelling, Steins;Gate or Tokyo Revengers style), together with the abundance of school and working life (that are striking similarities to both Re:LIFE and Sakura-sou no Pet na Kanojo). And if the series&#039; tagline of &quot;Let&#039;s time-travel to 10 years ago and re-enjoy creative and sweet youthful days.&quot; doesn&#039;t get to you, then I don&#039;t know how to sell this show to you.<br />

&quot;When you have confidence, you can have a lot of fun. And when you have fun, you can do amazing things.&quot; - Joe Namath<br />

There&#039;re dreams and aspirations that each and everyone of us wants to chase become, whether is it through influence or birthed from young (and it runs in the family), those are expectations. But the world isn&#039;t so kind to both good and bad boys and girls like us, such as the thought that the yearning or longing is but a distant dream left in our wildest dreams, that is reality. And for MC Hashiba Kyouya, everything about him screams like your typical MC with no backbone, but only a failure of a life lived with every regret on his shoulders: his 28-year old self being at the despicable end of his young adult life with a company-bust bankrupt of a salaryman&#039;s passion job. Even joining hands with one of his co-workers for a quick hand at a similar job also proves to be a bust. Well then, he&#039;s out of options, and out of jealousy for this group of people dubbed the &quot;Platinum Generation/Era&quot; that had a tumultuous ride in a different profession from Kyouya, and what is the next logical step down the pipeline? A night&#039;s sleep worth of rest to somehow mysteriously bring Kyouya back 10 years into the past of his beginning college days at the Oonaka University of Arts, and that&#039;s his new reality to start things afresh with the foreseeable future in mind to rid of potential missteps in the timeline. <br />

&quot;Believe it can be done. When you believe something can be done, really believe, your mind will find the ways to do it. Believing a solution paves the way to solution.&quot; - David J. Schwartz<br />
<br />
This is where the Re:LIFE similarities end, and in comes Sakura-sou no Pet na Kanojo with the whole vibe livening from the cast of characters and the aforementioned setting: the school life and the shared dorm house of these talents (which they form the Platinum Generation/Era). The Share House Kitayama consisting of the talents of illustrator Aki Shino (everyone just calls her Shinoaki), singer Nanako Kogure and author Tsurayuki Rokuonji, add Kyouya into the mix and you&#039;ll have an exact copy of Sakura-sou of young adults just living life together both at home and in school, where these 4 trudge through the usual tendencies of school with their Arts program of learning essential skills pertaining to video making, while keeping their friendship as a track record together. I&#039;m very sure that we&#039;ve all been through college at one point, and depending on your IRL relationship, these are the last memories of friendships before the adulting stage, where everyone just forgo friendship to chase after their dreams. Even with rival and future co-worker Eiko Kawasegawa, these dreams don&#039;t come easy, as Kyouya dips into each of their lives, trying to amend their mistakes by following the future already foretold, that he simply forgot that this absolute madman of a control would come back to haunt their lives. &quot;S(he)&#039;s a super freak, super freak&quot; as Rick James would sing out. Keep a look out for Keiko Tomioka, she&#039;s not only a veteran in the game industry playing the Senpai role to the rest, but because she&#039;s part of the reason why this show works, with or without reason.<br />

&quot;Doubt can motivate you, so don’t be afraid of it. Confidence and doubt are at two ends of the scale, and you need both. They balance each other out.&quot; - Barbra Streisand<br />

Personally, Bokutachi no Remake touches the heart pangs of a specific life chapter where all of us wanted to be: if we could just Re:LIFE, and relive a time in our lives again to fix all the loopholes and missing pieces of our lives being a huge jigsaw puzzle of sorts. But being human, it&#039;s easy to be misled that nothing is ever 100% perfect in the first place. There will always be that 1% failure rate where something goes wrong that&#039;ll unconsciously balloon into situations or circumstances that we can control, but cannot tamper with the end result that&#039;s directed from our actions. And this is what this series tries to attempt at: being a work of art that not a ton of stories like this manages to do so brillantly well, while some can label the story setting as the same generic stuff seen all over again. I kid you not that Bokutachi no Remake is something really interesting and special: a story about regrets, confidence, perseverance, and &quot;Teamwork makes the dream work&quot;. And this is no more indicative best than from Stewart Stafford&#039;s quote: &quot;Confidence is when you believe in yourself and your abilities, arrogance is when you think you are better than others and act accordingly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Confidence is a lot of this game or any game. If you don’t think you can, you won’t.&quot; - Jerry West<br />

Studio feel. is back after finishing the ultimatium that is OreGairu Kan (and that one Fruit Tart idol show), and man, does it feel great to see this studio&#039;s production still remain stellar from the work ethic of 1 or 2 anime produced per year to give its staff some breathing room to do the best that they could without feeling the crunch. And by far, Bokutachi no Remake is yet another crowning achievement of the stellar and vibrant visuals and animation that we&#039;ve come to know of the studio, that quality is more than quantity, leading to better produced shows overall. Especially though in the OP and ED visuals, those are some really striking visuals (and not just for fanservice reasons), and my eyes are easily blinded by such incredible talents working on this show. So I must say that feel., you&#039;ve done it yet again.<br />
<br />
If anything, I&#039;m very drawn to music bands from Bushiroad&#039;s many franchises (because of D4DJ), and the OP/ED set by BanG Dream! idol groups Poppin&#039;Party and Argonavis are great, upbeat songs. No favouritism, but while Poppin&#039;Party&#039;s OP is good, Argonavis&#039;s ED is a perfect fit that vibes along with the heartstrings of the anime&#039;s themes of possibilities. Also, since this Summer season is a season where EDs are a lot better than OPs, Bokutachi no Remake is no exception to that moniker. I just love the sound of youth from Argonavis which brings the early 2000s teen movie vibes, and I&#039;m all here for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Love who you are, embrace who you are. Love yourself. When you love yourself, people can kind of pick up on that: they can see confidence, they can see self-esteem, and naturally, people gravitate towards you.&quot; - Lilly Singh<br />
<br />
There a lot of charm that can be said about Bokutachi no Remake, but it would be best said if you watched the anime and let those feelings tug at your heart. To see its underlying profound effects and lessons learnt about risking life at its best and worst, even in the wildest imaginations of a re-do at life. It&#039;s a passion project of a  lesson that tells of how to use your life to the fullest, and not procrastinate at even wish fulfillments that feels far from reach. Stretch out your hand, and make it your best shot. Don&#039;t go at it alone, build friendships, be motivated to work it out, and most importantly, have fun in all that you do, because we only have one life, and that&#039;s all it matters.

    This is one of the few anime that I’m looking forward to watching in this season. I didn’t expect much at first, but as I finished the first episode, my mind was completely blown away. <br />
<br />
First of all, I didn’t read the manga, so I’ll write based on what I see in the first four episodes. This will be more like my first impression rather than a review, so I won’t dive much into the details.<br />
<br />
It started with a guy that’s been struggling to find a decent job. Apparently, things never go his way. Then, a miracle finally strikes. There’s this one girl that he

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409686">
        met at the bridge. Luckily, her company was looking for an editor. He knew that it’s his chance to rise to the surface. Unfortunately, as always, things didn’t go his way. Their project was declined. He was so lost that he was hoping he could go back to change his past. He was determined that the reason he’s been failing is because he chose the wrong path in university. He picked something else, instead of art, so he wanted to change that. He thought maybe if he had chosen art, he could go big in life. He closed his eyes, and the moment he opened his eyes, he caught himself living in the past. He’s back to where he was 10 years ago, where he went for art. Things start to get interesting after that. <br />
<br />
To be honest, I was kind of confused by the plot at first, considering it was such a simple storyline. I can’t seem to wrap my head around it. But once I got a grasp on it, I knew that I was going to like this anime. I could get a clear idea on what to expect for the outcome if he had already turned back in time. Story aside, I fell head over heels for the art style, specifically the eyes. It looks charming as ever. Well, I did expect it, as it was coming from ‘feel’, the studio that has been getting a lot of recognition for the past few years. Character wise, they’re very likeable. The voice actors have successfully brought each of the character’s persona, especially Aki and Eiko. Oh, and one more thing. The main character in this show kinda reminds me of the main character from Sakurasou. Both of them have been struggling to find what they’re good at, while living in a circle full of genius students. <br />
<br />
I’m very satisfied with the first four episodes. They’re kinda exciting to watch. Not to mention, I have to give proper props to ‘feel’, as it has successfully made this anime stand out in this season. A must watch anime for sure.

    Honestly, I’ve been sat here for the past hour or so trying to come up with some profound introduction and explanation as to why I liked BokuRemake. I ultimately failed. The waifus carried it. No, in all seriousness, It’s a show that I struggle to quantify what exactly made it tick for me.<br />
<br />
 I guess if there’s one lesson to be taken away from the series, it’s that you should pursue things you’re passionate about when the opportunity is presented. The MC’s whole dilemma in life and ultimate time travel scenario is set up because of him not going to art school. Instead of starting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418254">
        a coup and genocide as a result, he just works at a video game company before being transported back in time.<br />
<br />
 I loved the characters in the show and thought their chemistry was really good.  The MC basically becomes the glue that holds a talent generation of artists together. I felt at times he was used as primarily a tool for their growth rather than actually being his own character. I don’t think it was detrimental to the overall story, but it was noticeable at times. I also found the direction of the plot to be a bit confusing at times. Especially in the final stretch of the cour where it seemed like there was twist after twist with little time to explain in 3 episodes.<br />
<br />
The show ultimately gets more right than it gets wrong though. I love shows that focus on creatives. Artists have their own unique issues and we get a little exposure into that world. While dramatised, we also get a pretty nice look into the world of video game design and Japanese work culture in general. The pressure that the MC’s team is under while designing a video game in a couple episodes was really palpable. I also enjoyed his problem solving skills and seeing him overcome seemingly impossible odds in some scenarios.<br />
<br />
Time Travel anime can either be hit or miss. They’re usually all worth watching and BokuRemake is no exception. I certainly loved watching this show and have it in my top 3 of the season, but at times the story feels a little… lacking? The main sell here is the waifus and slice of life moments, which is more than enough for me in fairness. <br />
<br />
BokuRemake gets 9 out of 10.

    Remake Our Life is the type of show where it takes a commonly used plot mechanic (time travel) and builds around it with a main character. It&#039;s not exactly an unique idea but let&#039;s face it, we&#039;re in 2021 and most ideas have been overused already. Remake Our Life decides to use time travel as a catalyst to remake a main protagonist&#039;s life.<br />
<br />
Based on the light novel of the same name, the series is fundamentally what it sounds like. The chance to go back in time and remake your own life is something that I&#039;m sure some of us have wished for in our lives.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418233">
        As a video game creator, Kyouya Hashiba gets his second wind when he wakes up 10 years from 2016 to 2006. The story drops him into a timeline where he gets the opportunity to turn his life around and avoid a catastrophic future.<br />
<br />
Watching Remake Our Life was a bit cautious at first because time travel can be a risky plot device. Some anime can work wonders with such an idea while others is almost unacceptable. How should time travel be accepted into this show? Well for starters, we have to understand that Kyouya is 28 years old who became unemployed after his dream job company went bankrupt. It&#039;s a circumstance that happens often in the video game industry. By getting the break he needs with this time travel, Kyouya literally can make his own life successful again by becoming a more creative game creator. It&#039;s harder than it sounds but thanks to the second chance, he can follow his dream and not be a washed up salaryman.<br />
<br />
Despite being the main protagonist, the show shares a fair amount of screen time for it leading cast. It&#039;s almost if the cast is linked and destined to meet one another. The character roster includes Aki Shino, Nanako Kogure, Tsurayuki Rokuonji, and Eiko Kawasegawa. Most interestingly, these characters are young adults than the typical high school kids you find in light novel adaptations. As the series wants to explore a more young adult environment, it&#039;s more refreshing and also allows the audience to see the what the video game industry is like from inside and out. At its core, the principal character cast here are unified almost like a family together.  They are all there to be in their own roles and also support Kyouya in some way or form. It&#039;s also realistic at the same time as we see the hardship of working. A risky problem for Kyouya is how much he has to carry the burden and keeping the passion alive. Watching him take calculated risks such as coding games and building projects shows how much of a daredevil he is. Not only is he risking financial investment into games, he also risks his mental health and relationships with his co-workers.<br />
<br />
Speaking of relationships, the main triangle (or perhaps more suitable as &#039;love triangle&#039;) is between Kyouya, Aki, and Nanako. One of the episodes specifically dedicates time to give Kyouya and Aki intimate time with a festival mood. Throughout the series, it becomes more obvious that Nanako also harbors feelings towards Kyouya and it&#039;s hard to decide who to root for. More interestingly is that the show focuses a lot on realism involving character relationships. With each passing episode, you almost forget the anime had a time travel element in it. Furthermore, Kyouya&#039;s friendship and rivalry with Tsurayuki is a cleverly executed as the two brings out the best from each other. Tsurayuki himself is also a fascinating character after we see his involvement with a girl from the past. The show builds him as a secondary protagonist with his own assets and characteristics. Furthermore, the anime also establishes Eiko as a mature young woman with skills in the video game industry. It&#039;s pleasing to see the show not forget any of its main character cast regardless what timeline they are in.<br />
<br />
Among many subjects, one of the bigger sell points of the show is realism. This has been mentioned before it&#039;s very refreshing to see young amateurs build their way up and learn about the video game industry such as Kyouya. Has to learn and experiment with creating video games firsthand to understand its mechanics. It&#039;s more than just textbooks that he learns at school and we can see how difficult is to become succcessful at making just one game. As a gamer myself, this show drew me as it shows how every game has its own challenges to make whether it&#039;s coding, researching or crunching hours to meet deadlines. At its apex, I believe this show has an inner psychology that explores the realism of adult working people. And that is a something that should be respected for this anime.<br />
<br />
With a character cast of young adults, the anime has an overall more mature feeling. The female character has their alluring tones such as Aki&#039;s big breasts or Nanako&#039;s lavish blonde hair. Eiko herself is quite a looker with her scarlet red hair. Kyouya lands a bit lower in the looks department but he attracts at least two girls in the show. And while the anime is very light on fan service, it still has some compromising moments and the obligatory beach episode. <br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t a difficult anime to get into and you can watch this without breaking a sweat. It&#039;s a simple show that uses time travel as a plot device but ultimately doesn&#039;t rely on it to sell its main story. Instead, it&#039;s the character cast that carries the show together staring Kyouya. For an anime like Remake Our Life, it&#039;s so pleasing to see it turn an overused idea and turn it into a blessing.

    All of us have looked back on our past and felt unfulfilled. It&#039;s natural to regret poor decisions. All of the missed opportunities, people you never met, mistakes you made. If you could change the years you regret the most, would you?<br />
<br />
Kyoya is a failed adult who gets a second chance to relive his college years. After getting fired from his dream job at a game company, he mourns his wasted youth. He regrets not enrolling in an art university, then falls asleep. Upon opening his eyes, he is ten years in the past and instantly decides to go to college. Once enrolled, he immediately

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418241">
        recognizes his roommates as successful artists from the future. His writing skills impress everyone—because he accidentally stole the idea from his only male roommate. Though he regrets benefitting from his friend&#039;s failure, he still reaps the rewards. Some of the rewards include ladies who quickly take an interest in him for his very generic looks and filmmaking talents. <br />
<br />
He is where he belongs: A place where people recognize his talent. Kyoya embodies the everyman trope prominently utilized in isekai light novel adaptations. A businessman in a dead-end job living with his parents, he yearns to relive his youth and gets transported into an idealized version of college. He lacks discernable characteristics or individuality, making it easy for you to project onto him.<br />
<br />
All the girls are the same height and body type to be as marketable as possible. For this reason, I will refer to them by hair color first. Though three out of five of the main cast are women, their dialogue is mainly with Kyoya or about him. As the poster art suggests, this is somewhat of a harem anime. You&#039;ll see plenty of fanservice at inconvenient times, but they tone it down after the first couple of episodes. Shinoaki, the blue-haired girl, is a sleepy and airheaded artist. Her character arc begins and ends in one episode—she questions her talent, and Kyoya quickly reassures her that&#039;s not the case. This moment sparks a flame of love. There is no romantic progression or chemistry between the two, and it just happens to us. We are helpless passengers aboard this slowly derailing train. The red-haired girl, Kawasegawa, is a little too confrontational for her own good. Frequently she harshly criticizes people for justified reasons; however, the direction frames it as a bad personality trait. Suddenly dark music plays or cuts out altogether, and they use close-ups to emphasize the anxiety she causes. She works through this flaw—which being critical isn&#039;t really a flaw at all, and that&#039;s the crux of her arc. She has a cute side that she only shows to the main character. Is it love? Watch to find out. Her primary purpose in Kyoya&#039;s story is to provide motivational speeches and assist him on art projects. <br />
<br />
Whereas Nanako, the blonde girl, is stern and has character development—reserved for the show&#039;s first half. She becomes irrelevant afterward. As an actress who is conflicted about her future, she deals with self-doubt and insecurities. Although her turmoil seems exaggerated with melodramatic dialogue, she is more compelling than the rest. She, too, has a cute side that she only shows to the main character. Their romantic development is gradual rather than forced. If only Kyoya had the character depth to compliment hers. The dialogue, especially involving Nanako, is awful: they utilize her for fanservice and to fawn over Kyoya, only to sideline her shortly after that.<br />
<br />
What the hell kind of friend are you? There&#039;s a recurring problem here: Kyoya assumes the wants and needs of his friends without actually asking them first, and the story rewards him for this. At best, it&#039;s presumptuous to believe you could solve someone&#039;s issues for them. Though the show pays lip service to this idea, it is ultimately a mistake it continues to make until the end. I wouldn&#039;t say I like the term &quot;self-insert&quot; because it implies the author wrote himself in the story as the main character. Instead, Kyoya is an avatar for the audience. He is an everyman—generic in every sense for us to project onto him. We can live our fantasies like a hot successful college film student surrounded by single attractive women. And no judgment if that&#039;s what you want. The ladies vie for his attention; one girl even says the classic &quot;I won&#039;t lose&quot; line, implying she&#039;ll never give up on her love. The other men are, of course, perverts, unattractive, or lacking the talent Kyoya possesses. There are a couple more recurring faces that leave little impression. <br />
<br />
Attempts at self-aware humor fall flat without follow-up. Kyoya&#039;s friend says, &quot;All of those girls, for no reason, are in love with me as soon as the game begins!&quot; He shrugs it off, and then things move on to normal. Cue the fan service and girls fighting over him despite being thoroughly mediocre. Jabbing at the cringe-worthy nature of dating simulators is funny but woefully misguided here. Remake engages in the same harem cliches it mocks, and in the words of a better writer than me: &quot;Self-awareness does not absolve anybody of anything.&quot; We&#039;ve been aware of a problem the show has, but there&#039;s no subversion. Shinoaki continues to dizzily follow Kyoya around like a lost puppy, and Nakano pines for him in the background. Tsurayuki, the aforementioned male roommate, has the unfortunate role of getting pushed around by our hero. Kyoya does his best to apologize and explain, and it works to keep him in order. Similar to the ladies, his insecurities manifest as imposter syndrome. He worries he&#039;s not contributing enough—and this is an intriguing theme that Remake cuts short. <br />
<br />
The art is utterly forgettable—generic character designs, bland background art, and minimal animation. Of course, dynamic artwork is unneeded for a shallow harem LN adaptation primarily made up of tedious conversations. The music adds insignificant emotional impact because it&#039;s recycled repeatedly—kind of like a typical visual novel soundtrack. The catchy opening track sung by the leading ladies somewhat makes up for the lackluster OST. The outro is mellow and relaxing, shown on a movie reel to reference the film they created. Remake suffers from coming off as insincere in its portrayal of artists at times; during the film screenings, characters tell us how great the short films were, but the viewer rarely sees them. When we&#039;re supposed to believe these are super talented artists, you have to prove it. There were moments it did prove to us their talents, such as with Nanako&#039;s singing and Shinoaki&#039;s art, which fulfilled this potential. <br />
<br />
In the ninth episode, the show evolves. Right as it sunk into mediocre melodrama, it threw a curveball to grab our attention. The author finally made use of the time travel mechanic, though it was ultimately in vain. He attempts to confront the implausible fantasy premise of the show with a Butterfly Effect sort of twist. Credit where credit is due, Kyoya develops ever so slightly, but not enough to be relatable. The dialogue primarily consists of narration to catch us up on new information—similar to a recap episode. And you have to admit, recap episodes are pretty dull. Despite the balls it took to make drastic changes so late, this was ultimately the weakest part of the show. In forgoing the character development of the first eight episodes, there needed to be a worthwhile reason.<br />
<br />
Imagine the most generic school harem anime possible: Remake Our Life is what comes to mind. Forgettable character designs, monotonous background music, and archetypal love interests compete for the everyman protagonist. Ten years ago, the tacked-on-time travel premise would&#039;ve been inventive. Today it&#039;s derivative. Better anime have done this premise before Steins;Gate, ReLife, Orange, and even Erased. Ironically, the main character travels to the past to relive his youth, never realizing our experiences—even the cringe-worthy ones—make us who we are today. Flawed, imperfect, but unmistakably ourselves. Like Kyoya&#039;s memories, mistakes, and poor choices, Remake Our Life should&#039;ve stayed in the past.

    Remake Our Life! was an anime that I stumbled across and when I took a glimpse into it, I knew I was going to get into it and see the story as a whole. A time-travel anime about a man who failed in life that went back 10 years ago, definitely doesn&#039;t sound like plagiarism right there.<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
The story is definitely not the most original you can find or sink your teeth in for a brand new experience, but the plot execution is done well and introduces good set pieces that mean something as you progress later into the story. Around the last quarter, it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418234">
        begins to unfold its real message. The twist is well-built and realistic that you wouldn&#039;t expect it to come in the first place.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
The character designs and art background absolutely delivers it. They may not look like the most beautiful art to ever been witnessed, but they sure look pretty good and the animation is smooth. It may have some odd moments, but I was interested to look more at what the anime has to offer.<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
There are some good characters that are proof of the author&#039;s genuine attempt at making someone and not a carbon copy of one&#039;s personality, but some of their dialogues and interactions with one another can be a bit predictable and hard to look at. Indeed, the main character doesn&#039;t have the best personality, but the storyline makes it doable for him to be worth the attention.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
I really enjoyed it because I goggled a lot at the art of some characters and thought to myself of how gorgeous do these people were designed. It&#039;s not pretty bad and I&#039;m glad that the story was able to keep me intrigued from the whole start to finish. Though the first episode can feel dragged. The anime was a great experience and I hope for a possible sequel.

    There is something about this show that just really clicks to me. For a number of reasons. The medium of creation is just too beautiful to put into words. Where you are in it for script writing, filming, or just drawing and making a dream tat you are chasing being realized. Combine that, with the idea of a second chance, and to see the possibilites that can happen during and because of such. It makes a recipe for success when it comes to this show.<br />
<br />
The story follows tat. Our MC, Kyouya Hashiba, has been given something that most of us crave, depending how our lives

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409695">
        went. A second chance at life. A second chance to make the dreams that he didn&#039;t chase, become a reality and true. While the story didn&#039;t completely start from there, but it does set it up perfectly, for wen the moment happens, it adds more to the story, which is really well done. As we follow Kyouya, doing his best to make good use of his second chance, along with befriending and understanding new friends along the way.<br />
<br />
<br />
The main take from the characters is that they are beautiful and unique in their own way. As I stated with everyone chasing their own dream. Along with each of them having their own personality, but one thing that just inspires me about this cast, is just ow driven and passionate, and determined that they all are. As if they want to one up each other, in a friendly competition like way. Pushing each other to do their best in every step of te way. Stuff like this, makes for a great cast.<br />
<br />
Art and sound<br />
What I really dig about this shows art, is not only does it make each scene look great in many areas. Where it be a more lighter setting, or one more dark. It also really puts the own characters within the show&#039;s art to life in perfect form. Good stuff all round. While the sound is top notch also. Can&#039;t go wrong in either department.<br />
<br />
There is a lot of charm to this sow, I&#039;m certainly enjoying it, and you should be too! Start watching it now if you haven&#039;t done such already!<br />

    Bokutachi no Remake is a disaster. Generic, tropey, pacing issues, and bland characters; it&#039;s a watered down version of multiple shows hamfisted together.<br />
<br />
Story: There&#039;s nothing wrong with having a generic story that&#039;s well executed. The issue is that Bokutachi no Remake lacks execution. It&#039;s mainly hampered by it&#039;s pacing. The setting and relatable feeling of wanting a &#039;redo&#039; in life are the main hooks of the series. It&#039;s a train wreck watching these college students &#039;work&#039; as a team on projects when the show skips over the process of it entirely. One minute they&#039;re setting up equipment, the next they&#039;re done presenting in front of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409711">
        the class. You have to wonder how there&#039;s suppose to be any satisfaction watching the mc or other characters go through tribulations with pacing this quick. Oh and every episode throws in a random fan service scene just to make sure the viewer is awake. 2/10.<br />
<br />
Art: feel. does an ok job with the art. There&#039;s a handful of scenes that look great but it&#039;s very safe and average for the most part. 6/10.<br />
<br />
Sound: Nothing notable. Enjoyed the voice acting for the most part other than the mc and the baffling decision of having Aki Shino sound as annoying as possible. 3/10.<br />
<br />
Characters: An abomination in this category. Mc who can do no wrong and everyone goes to for help (self-insert), the obnoxiously voiced character you would be surprised isn&#039;t a child, generic girl #2, and generic guy #2. Yes there&#039;s nothing more to them they&#039;re that simple and painfully shallow. 1/10.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: While a college setting is always welcomed, that&#039;s about all the enjoyment Bokutachi no Remake gave me. There&#039;s no time to care about the characters (who are for the most part extremely poor anyway), there&#039;s no satisfaction seeing them succeed, the execution is extremely lacking, and there&#039;s bad comedy to top it all off. 1/10. <br />
<br />
Final thoughts: If you enjoy self-inserting, harems, and the occasional fan service scene, I&#039;d give it a try. Otherwise avoid.

    Note: The ep count is a mistake on my part. Currently up to date with the release.<br />
<br />
This anime deals with themes that are supposed to be appealing to both men and women since both go through the qualms of regrets of our youth, academic and work decisions, and the choices we make along the way. Plus the anime doesn&#039;t have any harem, ecchi tags, right? So I walked into it thinking I&#039;ll have a nice show to watch with decent characters.<br />
<br />
1. Misplaced fanservice:<br />
<br />
Bokutachi no Remake is apparently a show about a man with underutilized creative potential getting a second chance at life, and he gets

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409740">
        to intermingle with 3 of the most talented people in the industry in his new life. In his rewound timeline, after taking the road previously not taken, he finds himself in a dorm with 3 people. Hmm, I wonder who they are? By the way, the main cast comprises 2 males and 2 female characters.<br />
3 episodes in, you explore the male characters&#039; personalities, their strengths, and weaknesses.<br />
But the first female is introduced by a boob shot, and the second one gets bra shots and has so little spatial awareness that the only way to file cans in a shelf in an empty room is from behind the male MC in a way that her chest rubs against his skull. Right after a ruminative moment.<br />
<br />
It is disheartening that in an anime that is supposed to have themes most people can relate to, half of the main cast is sexualized in these immoderate manners which often break the immersion or ruin the tone of the narrative. What exactly does this anime want its viewers to do? Contemplate life while getting a hardon? Ofc if you only watch anime for fanservice, that&#039;s a different devil.<br />
I will exclude harem, ecchi-tagged anime from this sort of criticism because they&#039;re what they&#039;re supposed to be.<br />
<br />
2. Plot<br />
<br />
This will be pretty short but here&#039;s the gist. What is the point of having an MC remaking his life if apparently, he&#039;s already so adept that he becomes everyone&#039;s saving grace? Is he a relatable MC or is he what we wish we could&#039;ve been? <br />
<br />
Some dialogues flow as if they were written by a preteen. Interactions are so mechanically emotional, it&#039;s akin to watching a melodramatic play. Why is X just frowning while Y (a stranger for all that matters) is spitting hostility towards him? Why does Z accuse X of doing something really specific only to casually take it back for pseudo-bonding after a &quot;fight&quot;? <br />
<br />
My complaints would likely increase as I keep watching because the episodes keep declining in their consistency. Overall, the appeal of this anime seems to be on the themes that may be found as relatable to many, but for a lot of reasons, it falls short.

    oh boy... here we go<br />
<br />
I was (moderately ) hyped for this show... well because of the big &#039;plot&#039; on the poster lmao and tbf this season was very mid with exception for few animes that I&#039;ve watched.<br />
I watched the first ep and thought to myself that it was somewhat decent but i still think that it could be good after few eps or so i thought....<br />
And here we are, all wrapped up, and with my score, you can probably tell what I thought of it.<br />
<br />
The premise is interesting, but the execution is disappointing because by the end of it, u don&#039;t even know what was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418235">
        the point of kyouya going back in time other than use it as plot device?. Interestingly enough this show setting is in college, which is refreshing since a lot anime deals with high school story. Unfortunately, the college setting wasnt really use that well because when i watched it, it felt like im watching yet another high school harem , slice of life, wish fulfilment anime and its really sad tbh . At first, I didn&#039;t like how kyouya solving every basic stuff for his friends but after that, the show took a surprising turn where we see kyouya is in a devastating state after what he did to the platinum gen in one ep but fear not jesus kun was able to pick himself up and able to solve a company issue in the next ep. In a nutshell, this is a decent time-waster but ultimately disappointing.<br />
<br />
This show gave me a lot of stress and irritation to see how much love this show is getting, while im sitting here and wondering how the hell u think this show is great?. its so annoying to see on reddit, mal, yt or Instagram praising tf out of this show ( yes, im well aware that enjoyment is important but like i dont even see a lot of the ppl pointing out how terrible written this story is ) .Also, im not even watching anime to be objectively critical or whatever i just wanna enjoy anime but with this anime i cant even turn off my brain to tolerate some of the writing. Every time a new ep comes out, i always try my best to enjoy this show but bruhh some of the sloppy writing in this show gives me headache. also, the fanservice in this show is stupid and weird and also completely disrupting the tone of the narrative that the show trying to potray. The choice to make kaguya&#039;s va sound like a toddler is stupid because when a scene involving her talking something important, it makes me hard to not pull a face. Talking abt aki, why does maki look exactly like her mother? geez, talking abt taking laziness to another level. <br />
<br />
The problems that i have with this series:<br />
<br />
1. the pacing or details<br />
<br />
This show could&#039;ve been more than 12 eps considering how many things that they skipped over and how badly pace it was. For example, in ep 2, kawasegawa came out of nowhere starting to accuse kyouya that he&#039;s underestimate filmmaking and basically saying her team is gonna be better than kyouya&#039;s team. Now, this could&#039;ve at least expand more or show us or tell us on why kawasegawa acting like this or maybe she just plain rude ( but i dont think thats the case ) or jealous because later on the story she became somewhat friendly or not the same person as she was in ep 2 - ep 4. Even if it was abt competition ,its still weird  . Moreover, they didnt even show us how good her video was and this becomes a trend where the show just gave us the students perspective or comments or how they feel abt the video presentation . Lets go on to ep 4, this is where the drama starts or should i say melodrama, kawasegawa was asked by her sister to join kyouya&#039;s team but again they jump straight to a new semester and completely disregarding kawasegawa&#039;s impact on the team. We could&#039;ve seen her bonding and building a relationship with the team and kyouya ,but no, all we got was a time skip and a badly written conflict between kawasegawa and nanako. Let me breakdown the situation, they had another film presentation and what a surprise they didnt show anything abt both kyouya and this student&#039;s team video. All we had was (again) the comments from the students saying that one of the member students&#039; team did a wonderful acting but nanako&#039;s acting was a bit robotic ,again from the student&#039;s perspective. How can u expect us, the audience, to care what kawasegawa said to nanako, for all we know nanako&#039;s acting probably didn&#039;t suck because its a matter of perspective, one can say that aki&#039;s voice is annoying asf but the other will say that its terrible. That scene can be much appreciated if we developed kawasegawa , as a new member, being implemented in kyouya&#039;s team and as well seeing her understanding nanako ( especially her personality), because for her to do that is a humiliation for nanako and besides, they won the bloody presentation so for her to do that is hella dumb. (imo) They could&#039;ve done one more presentation where kyouya&#039;s team lose because of the team not performing &#039;seriously&#039; ( because they want to focus on that topic so much ) and it took eiko to step up and hit reality on the team but noooo. A proper build up can make the audience more caring abt that moment and make kawasegawa to not look like a jerk. Moving on, in ep 5, this is where i got respect for kawasegawa because she knew she messed up and had the balls to confront nanako ahhh such a sweet moment but wait our beta mc ,kyouya, had to ruin that moment. im sorry but why in the fuk did u do that? who are u to say that kawasegawa didnt need to apologize? im actually baffled when that scene happened, he completely stole nanako&#039;s right and stole that beautiful moment. The first half of ep11 was weirdly pace that u are confused to how kyouya manage to solve this company&#039;s problem because we didnt see him contacting anyone or discussing with anyone abt fixing the problem in the last ep and somehow he gave a document ( out from his ass i guess ) abt this new engine. There&#039;s also a weird transition happened in ep 4, where it cut from kyouya in the share house to a cafe scene just like that.<br />
<br />
2. Kyouya<br />
<br />
If u fully expecting to have something that u can relate with the mc or seeing the mc going through such obstacles to achieve his goal, yeah u will not get that with this anime .The relatable part of the MC starts and ends with the first episode where he is depicted as someone who has made mistakes throughout his 20s. After that, he ceases to be relatable and becomes Gary Stu/Jesus-kun where whatever problem is thrown at him, he magically resolves it(and before anyone says &quot;he has experience from his old life&quot;, the problem with that is that, there is no &quot;presentation/process&quot; of him coming up with his solutions, hence, instead of looking like a genius, he comes out as someone with bullshit powers of problem-solving). idk how to describe it because throughout the show he show no weaknesses and his surrounding was sucking him off as if he was a reincarnation of god, and that&#039;s a big problem for this show is that the mc is too perfect that is too hard for ppl to root for him cause u know he&#039;s gonna succeed at it and it can be boring af. Can u tell me if this good? because later on the only &#039;mistake&#039; that he done throughout this series is ruin the platinum gen ( i mean yeah that&#039;s big ) but really? the only way to make him a good protagonist is to make his character have many flaws and relatable i guess. He&#039;s adaptable, competent , op and many more characteristic of an self insert harem protagonist . Overall, he suk . idk if this is a good analogy but whatever, kyouya is basically where u completed a game and it showed that u got a bad ending and u remembered that there was a choice to either have a gun or a knife but u chose a knife instead. Usually, when a player completed the game, they will be given the ability to go back to a certain checkpoint or mission to redo or to try differently from what the player initially did and also the player will have all the abilities unlocked for them to use . Essentially, I&#039;m saying kyouya is op because all he had to do is to choose art college and boom he have a &#039;perfect&#039; life. All im saying is this show doesnt need time travel because in ep 9, where he got sent to the future by keiko, he suddenly able to do his job just like that without any confusion abt what he&#039;s got to do or anything, like the dude just stupid op. What was the point of the time travel? and mind u this dude only been in college for 2 semester and a half, i know he have experiences in the og timeline but come on. Im just gonna say that he&#039;s too lazy to find another job when he was 28 and then wuss like a little puss talking abt i wanna redo my life just to have a better future.<br />
<br />
3. Romance<br />
<br />
I love romance story, i adore it but i have to say Mal should remove the romance tag for this anime, literally zero romance happened in this anime other than the kiss. Throughout the series, i dont see Kyouya have any sort of romantic feeling for all the girls that he met and he even said it. Literally, the decision to make aki and kyouya married was retarded, like there was never a proper build up or development in the romance department for aki and kyouya to even justified that they are married. Also, why do they ended ep 5 with a kiss and then the next ep not addressing anything abt that kiss? im sorry if a girl just kiss me, i will definitely ask her &#039;why did u do that?&#039; and also what was the point of letting nanako witnessing the kiss? i though there will be a drama or something. i guess thats one more thing abt this show that makes it bad. Overall, the romance in this show serve nothing to the plot other than to please the 14 yrs old seeing their waifu end up with the mc. Zero progression in the romance part and stupid attempt to make as if nanako had a chance with the mc. Also, continue on the kiss scene was dumb because there is no real buildup to the romance scenes or context, (for God’s sake the main characters doesn’t even likes her other than admiring her art) which makes the scenes unsatisfying and coming out of nowhere. Dont watch this show for the romance because u will get none of it.<br />
<br />
4. Time travel and keiko<br />
<br />
The time travel concept in this show is barely explored in any imaginable way and feels like it&#039;s only a plot device to works conveniently in favor of the protagonist. Questions like: &quot;Why Kyouya? Why not Kawasegawa? Or Tsurayuki?&quot; , &quot;Who or what triggers the time travel?&quot; and &quot;Is a deep-seethed regret the prerequisite to be a candidate for time travel?&quot; never occurs to the mc and its actually ridiculous considering how this anime trying to be realistic. Throughout the series, we never learn anything abt how kyouya got back in time and also why &#039;they&#039; choose kyouya?,Questions like these, haven&#039;t been answered after 11 episodes, and if the final episode doesn&#039;t give us anything about the time travel, then it is sufficient enough to conclude that it&#039;s nothing more than plot device and it&#039;s just there to &quot;satisfy&quot; Kyouya&#039;s desire for change. the explanation is just stupid, how can a man got travel back in time ( he even said before that it was impossible ) and not even bother to question abt this phenomenon that is happening to him ( or at the very least tell us that he did try to investigate but didnt get anything that is useful but in the mean time, he just need to move forward) and even the second time, he didnt do nothing to question abt keiko sudden appearance and as well as how he got back in the future instead he just live his normal life just like that and able to adapt to his new job . He&#039;s a 28 yrs old man, shouldnt he know that someone&#039;s future will change if he interrupts someone&#039;s past but i guess he didnt care that he got back in time. Also, why did his goal change? he goes from i wish i can go back in time and choose art instead to he&#039;s here to help the platinum gen, whatttt???? im so confused to his logic, look i guess he&#039;s a bit retarded that he took awhile to realise that aki was a member of the platinum gen but like shouldnt u be thinking that they will become famous in the future so their problems will be sorted by their own but instead he tries to help everyone. I mean i guess it cant be helped that he had to meddle their problems but shouldnt he strategies abt how to approach this guys problems and not to disrupt their future that much. Now, he got to face the consequences that he didnt meant to do and as well was somewhat innocent from the first day since he got sent back in time out of nowhere. Look, no one is asking for the time travel to be amazingly explained or whatever but pls make it logical instead of this crap. if the show make the mc awares abt the time travel and as well make the mc&#039;c personality less generic, i would accept that but yeah instead we got this crap. Questions need to be answered here, who&#039;s keiko and why?oh well kyouya dont care at all since his look in the last ep just says it all that this show dont care if they use the time travel as a plot device.  No normal human being will react like that .<br />
<br />
<br />
In conclusion, ill say that this show couldve been better if the EXECUTION was done right and if they make this a 24 ep show and make the pacing be decent. Truth be told, this is a mediocre series and couldnt understand the positives vibe that it gets. I can see what the author is trying to tell but it turns out to be a huge disappointment, the Ln is probably better but idk. Overall, idm u enjoy this show but pls stop saying its great or a masterpiece or even good because its sure is not, it had some good moments and message but its fall flat by the piss poor pacing and story telling. If u want to watch some deep stuff, better off watching sakura sou or ping pong or even 3-gatsu no Lion than this garbage, at the very least sorata is a way better mc than this self insert mc. If u want to watch ppl make games, just watch saekano, they have better fanservices than this one. Thank god, its over.

    You can&#039;t change the past, even so I....<br />
<br />
Hashiba Kyouya, a 28 year old game developer.  With bad luck because his company went bankrupt, and he lost his job. He returned to his hometown, and could only see the success of the creator at his age at that time. It&#039;s just that Kyouya can&#039;t forget the time after high school graduation, he was given the two greatest options. Determined to go back to 2006 so he can go to film school (Oonaka Art College)<br />
<br />
Some of you may be surprised, or maybe some already know, that the first episode for the anime Bokurema (short for Bokutachi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409689">
        no Remake) is 50 minutes long!  This duration is the same as watching 2 episodes of TV anime at once. Unmitigated this anime uses a slightly different method from the others, so that the prologue of the story can be conveyed to the audience/viewer as well.<br />
<br />
For starters, even though this is only episode 4, I can quite recommend this anime, especially for those of you who are currently in education (especially students).  Here you can be inspired because you see the lives of students/campus life who take their studies to explore the sciences to hone their talents. Here you also learn, what is the fate of someone who is serious about studying, or who is too serious, or who is always relaxed, even lazy.  This will affect the quality of your work later. You are lazy to study? you can watch this anime to motivate you.<br />
<br />
This is an anime full of intrigue and drama, Is this in the Harem? Yeah, this is a Harem. This anime is a romantic genre, even so, the struggle to achieve that success is playing this anime project. How can they make a movie, How to organize a discussion, and also how they do team work. In a work team, anyone in your team must have experienced failure, and some have experienced success. When there is a problem in the team, each member must have a different path.  Giving up is not a solution, and if you have a problem with your work team, try to be more open to your fellow members, then think of ways to overcome the problem. <br />
<br />
If you can&#039;t get up on your own, ask someone else for help.<br />
If we are already destroyed by our own mistakes, then wait for the right time to get back up.<br />
If you can&#039;t invite other people, walk side by side with them.<br />
<br />
Everyone have weaknesses.<br />
It all depends on how we see it.<br />
<br />
That is called a &quot;Life!&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah, it just nonsense

    Basically RE life,  but better . I will not lie, many people after reading the synopsis and watching the first few episodes will be immediately reminded of Relife which is why i will write first about why this seems to be a better take of improvement and character development than the very famous relife.<br />
<br />
We had two 1 hour debut this season one was the highly anticipated tantei wa mo shinderu and the other was this one ,No one had any high expectations of bokutachi no remake but the 1 hour special definitely was a great decision <br />
<br />
SO why do ithink this is better than

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409709">
        Re life which is already a very amazing anime?The one hour special is the answer.<br />
<br />
1)The first episode makes it very clear of the current situation if the MC and where he currently stands and what he does etc and why he is here. The whole problem was caused  since he refused to be admitted into art school even after being accepted after highschool, in Relife we know he is a failure but not why . <br />
<br />
<br />
2)We are also  shown that the MC always did try to improve his situation , yes this is a big factor and certainly makes him likeable in relife the MC just cries about his situation and we never shown did he even try to improve his life ?<br />
<br />
<br />
This show has production values that might make movies fall to shame since the art is beautiful and gorgeous .the sakura scene at the end of episode 1 was truly magical , the voice acting is great with the exception of the loli voice of the female lead who is supposed to be in her 20s ,the story is nice with a good take on redemption which i cannot see failing (unless the erased  cocblockending is repeated ;/)<br />
<br />
Just watch the first episode and your sure to fall in love with this one<br />

    This could quite possibly be one of the worst takes on the idea of time travel I’ve ever seen in anime. You have anime like Steins Gate, Re:Zero, or Tokyo Revengers managing to add something new to the concept, and while not everyone might like them most people should agree that they’re all at least somewhat unique in their own way.<br />
And then you have Bokutachi No Remake give its spin on time travel, following our main character after he gets sent back in time and decides to… enter an art college?  <br />
<br />
The story kicks off with the painfully generic main character, Kyouya, struggling to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418229">
        find a stable job in his current life. When life is looking worse than it’s ever been, he makes a wish to get sent back in time, and would you believe it? His wish conveniently comes true! Apparently, the only other possible choice he has to fix up his life is to enter an art college so that’s exactly what he does. I’m not sure why he doesn’t become financially stable using his knowledge of the future to win some bets or lotteries, but each to their own I suppose. Once he settles into the college, he enjoys making films and various pieces of media while being surrounded by his own harem, what a lucky guy. The aspect of time travel barely phases him, and rather than try to figure out the source of it he simply enjoys life as a 28-year-old in an 18-year-old’s body. Oh boy, it sure is great getting to project myself onto another pathetic main character who’s been put into a situation that others would only dream of.<br />
<br />
Mr. Self Insert isn’t without his flaws, however. You see, he’s too amazing for his own good, often negatively influencing other people’s lives by simply being too perfect. This is a major issue that Kyouya is forced to overcome with each episode. Maybe his genius is from his extra 10 years of experience, or perhaps he’s naturally talented and wasn’t given the correct opportunity in his previous life. Either way there is very little attempt made to justify his amazingness, and you just have to accept that he is and always will be an incredible human being. They’ve made sure to give him the same character design as every other light novel character to ever exist, so you will have no problem imagining his experiences as your own.<br />
“After all, no matter how amazing an individual is, they’re less interesting without some kind of flaw.” This is a quote taken right from the very first episode, and it is absolutely hilarious to look back on after having watched all 12 episodes. It dares explain basic storytelling techniques straight to the audience and then completely butcher it in practice. To state out loud the character needs flaws, then to proceed to write a main character without any, is one of the funniest ways I’ve ever seen an anime screw itself over. It can’t go an episode without contradicting itself in some way and it’s almost impressive.<br />
<br />
But I don’t wanna bully the poor main character too much, as there are plenty of other characters to focus on as well. There’s a writer, a voice actor/singer, and an artist all living with Main Character-kun. They aren’t great, but when compared to the main character they are a massive improvement in terms of writing. They help provide a good insight into the struggles and hardships of various artistic industries while actually adding a sense of life to the anime. Granted it’s not perfect, but I can appreciate how the series at least attempts to show some of the struggles of real-life through the characters. An artist might lose their motivation to draw, a writer might be overwhelmed by how hard it is to become truly successful, or a singer might lack the self-confidence to truly work for their dream. These are all shown to some extent through the character decisions and various pieces of dialogue. It isn’t great, but at least there is something there in terms of character depth.<br />
<br />
For a show that likes to ramble on about media and storytelling it really sucks at both. There’s one scene in the first episode where we get to listen to a characters explain some screenplay techniques. This was more for the sake of showcasing the characters’ intelligence than anything but seeing as the anime went out of its way to spend five minutes explaining it, I might as well see how well it goes when paired against its own advice. It brings up the idea of ‘complications,’ an unpredictable turn in a story that leads to the protagonist failing. In this anime, however, you’ll find that the ‘unpredictable turns’ are simply terrible. The twists make no sense as this anime is pack-full of plot contrivances. Our protagonist never truly fails, and small inconveniences are overdramatised to the point where they just looks silly. This anime will try to make you believe that minor incidents are huge failures when they’re obviously not. Also, in case you’ve forgotten the main character is a generic self-insert, and no one wants to insert themselves into a guy who fails at something. Seeing him effortlessly complete every task that comes his way is anything but a complication, and no, I don’t count the fact that he is too good at everything for his own good to be one.<br />
<br />
Scenes will often feel incredibly forced, with numerous out-of-character moments that only exist to make something is happening on screen. There is never any sense of fluidness in the writing, and the entire anime is filled to the brim with ridiculous plot conveniences. The main character makes progression in a relationship? The love rival appears. The protagonist needs help doing something? Another character will appear with exactly what he needs. Multiple characters will act different to their usual selves in some scenes for the sake of the plot, completely ruining everything that had been built up about them previously. It’s lousy writing down to the core, and everything about it feels forced.<br />
<br />
The art and animation are subpar for the most part. A decent amount of effort was put into making sure the girls were cute enough, then the bare minimum was done for everything else. Character expressions are surprisingly well done for the most part and you’re able to get a good understanding of the characters through them. The soundtrack was forgettable, and I still can hardly remember anything about the opening or ending after having finished the anime.<br />
<br />
Bokutachi no Remake had the comedy tag when it began airing, but by the end was labeled as a drama with touches of supernatural and romance. Childish ideas are hidden behind failed attempts at a dramatic telling of a situation many people may wish to find themselves in. Because of this, this anime will never be anything more than another typical and forgettable light novel adaptation full of plot conveniences and lackluster characters. There are much better time travel anime out there, and there are other anime that manage to achieve what this anime attempts at a much better standard. If you want to see an adult re-live their school life, go read Re:Life. There’s no place for Bokutachi no Remake, and honestly there was never going to be.

    I first want to clear out some discrepancies that seemed to have arisen with this anime.<br />
<br />
1. I was told this anime is similar to ReLife. Because of how doltish and clueless ReLife is, Remake Our Life is *ONLY* similar to it in the time travelling aspect. You can ask for a link to my Anilist review to understand how stupid ReLife is.<br />
<br />
2. This anime is also said to be similar to Sakurasou, though this is a bit more warped comparison. The two main girls are both artists, but other than that, this anime is similar to Toradora, Bunny Girl Senpai, Golden Time, quite literally every

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418227">
        romance with drama you can think of. Of course, it just has its own little twist to give it its own name.<br />
<br />
Now onto the analysis.<br />
<br />
Remake Our Life isn&#039;t anything new to the mix of romance anime, though in saying this, it works at both ends. It&#039;s not an enlightening piece of media one may never see the likes of again, but it also isn&#039;t so abysmal you&#039;d lose faith in humanity. It&#039;s just like everything else, as I have pointed out. So honestly, there is no real reason to work my way through the narrative/characters and what have you because in what I would imagine is a largely popular genre, people will already understand what the ridiculously consistent logic will have to say about this anime, that is, basically everything you&#039;ve seen and known thus far. <br />
<br />
The only thing I can really talk about is the gimmicks and how effective they are at making this anime physically able to stand by itself. I came out of this anime not actually having too much memory as to what differentiates this from everything else, sure there was the time mechanic, but that wasn&#039;t explored too much in this anime unfortunately and seemed to be a back-of-the-head thought brought up every now and then. Self-aware note here, I am literally trying to think of other aspects that would otherwise make this anime more independent and nothing comes to mind. The only thing I can praise is Hashiba&#039;s leadership which seems to be non-existent with our young anime protagonist, at least most are have self-competence.<br />
<br />
The audiovisuals here basically fall under the same o&#039; so tyrannical order romance anime kneel down to, so I don&#039;t need to go over that, but the character designs are nice here for originality, though one could easily superimpose that with any other anime and get some similarities. There was an attempt at least.<br />
<br />
I am not sure what I was expecting from light novel adaptation #40904, but I thought this would turn out to be a lot more different than I anticipated. I guess I enjoyed it, I guess everyone will enjoy it, I mean, even if generic (which doesn&#039;t mean bad), who doesn&#039;t like a good romance anime? But this anime seems to get a lot more traction than I thought was possible, and there were tropes here that have gone past the expiry date of unique quality, which this anime doesn&#039;t seem to realise. At the end of the day, it&#039;s a nice story, but there is nothing here to suggest it is a big deal. I&#039;d recommend it to all, looking for something to watch when you have nothing else. But there is better out there in terms of high school stories.<br />
<br />
I suppose I will give out a few:<br />
<br />
Kimi ni Todoke - elaborates on its bliss; how ecstasy feels<br />
High Score Girl - romance in the gaming world and how one has to fix that in with reality<br />
Beastars - a great idea with a great presentation of social order in school (Warning: 2nd Season goes to shit towards the end, imo at least)<br />

    Escapism isekai-level bullshit <br />
<br />
It&#039;s a story about a guy who isn&#039;t special enough so he wishes to be reborn as a talented artist<br />
only half of that works (being sent 10 years in time) and he decides to use that excuse to live his unfulfilled romantic fantasies around his idols from his original timeline.<br />
So rather than using this as an oportunity to get good and grow as a character, he does what every other harem protagonist does best (simping every girl around him and avoiding the harsh reality)<br />
<br />
The itself is super contradictive with the theme, the art life being something one should take with maturity, because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411123">
        anyone in the field knows the diference between those 90% who just screw around at parties during school  and those 10% (sometimes 1%) who make it, with an idea like this I can&#039;t understand how it can be executed with the same old love-triangle-escapism-ecchi format.<br />
<br />
<br />
I feel so weird watching this it feels like a total insult to artists in real life and whoever had to put so much effort working on this <br />
This is a straight up insult to the whole anime industry<br />
<br />
I have nothing against ecchi anime, it&#039;s not what I watch or consider good, but if it stays in it&#039;s own place I&#039;m fine with it, just how I&#039;m fine with reality tv and low effort zombie movies, I just don&#039;t watch it and pretend they don&#039;t exist, because they are part of a different market/demographic that will always exist.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This anime deserves the &quot;what not to do in real life if you go back in time&quot; award<br />
The guy should have just bought bitcoin or something lmao.<br />

    Alright, let&#039;s talk about Bokutachi no Remake. <br />
<br />
Story 3 : So, Bokutachi no Remake is kind of similar to &quot;ReLife&quot;, you have a salary man who is sad and have regrets and wants to go back to the past. The main difference there is, is that here the MC just doesn&#039;t like his job, and basically wants to go back in time to change jobs and take a more risky way. In ReLife, it was more to &quot;solve&quot; a trauma the MC had, so the purpose was arguably &quot;bigger&quot;.<br />
<br />
I think the premises were interesting without being exceptional. The problem lies into its execution. We have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416369">
        an MC who doesn&#039;t know how he went back to the past, but also doesn&#039;t care. He basically lost 10 years of his life and is like &quot;I came back ten years in the past... That&#039;s crazy... Well anyway, gotta go to school then !&quot; so how the MC is living the story is pretty stupid, making the story a bit of a mess.<br />
<br />
Also, I&#039;m not gonna go into details, but the time travels are poorly done honestly. If I go into details it will spoil some stuff but let&#039;s say, for a 12-episodes season, you need to pace the time travels to fit in this format. Nobody wants a 8 episodes streak of nothingness like in Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu season 2.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art 6 : The art is fair, average without any impressing stuff, your SoL typical art.<br />
<br />
Sound 5 : The sound is quite average too but I would go more to the &quot;mediocre&quot; section, OP/ED are average and one special mention for the awful karaoke on &quot;God Knows&quot;. Like, you can put all the epic OST you want afterwards, with the MC saying how he was impressed, it doesn&#039;t change the fact that it was trash. And get you own song for a school festival event like, that&#039;s really stingy.<br />
<br />
Character 3 : So yeah we talked about how the MC is the type of person who is time traveling and doesn&#039;t really give a damn right ? So, that&#039;s probably because he&#039;s a robot with only one trait character, &quot;to not give up&quot;. Always smiling, always doing his best when times are hard, but when times are at peace, he&#039;s just chilling. Whether he lost 10 years of his life, or what happened to the world before or after his time travels is not his concerns, as long as his work is done and it&#039;s sunny outside.<br />
<br />
So if you understood the sarcasm, the problem here is that we have one-patterned character who can only express one thing and are defined by it. The singer who lacks confidence, the drawer who is an extrovert, or the writer who is a pain in the ass and the generator of &quot;drama&quot; to fuel the poor story.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment &amp; Overall 3 :<br />
<br />
The anime is already truly bland when you watch the past story execution, his life at school etc. It&#039;s truly like Overlord in its execution without the great story/world building/characters. It&#039;s basically &quot;Sasuga Hashiba-sama&quot; through the end. But when you add the non-logical time travel and how the MC doesn&#039;t give a shit to the story change, you just want to give up that anime.

    Bokutachi no Remake is a series adaptation of Japanese light novels written by Nachi Kio and illustrated by Eretto. Media Factory has published eight volumes since March 2017 under their imprint MF Bunko J. A manga adaptation featuring art by Bonjin Hirameki has been serialized through Kodansha&#039;s Suiyōbi no Sirius service since November 2018, being compiled into two tankōbon volumes. An anime series adaptation premiered on July 3, 2021, and its first episode lasted one hour.<br />
<br />
First of all I had my expectations a bit high with this anime and I am sure that when it ends it will be forgotten like any other anime of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review412429">
        the season<br />
<br />
The story is nothing innovative and new, it is rather another recycling of going back to the past and correcting your mistakes, ok until there is fine, it depends on how it is executed but unfortunately it also fails, literally a slice of life idealizing the protagonist in everything , favoring him in all the situations that there is to make him look good, they make him too nice and he is the only one who solves the situations where they are in trouble, this makes 2 women fall in love with him, this is the power of the fuck script, the rescue of him The series is its few drama scenes that there are and the little depth and background that the characters have, nothing new since this is seen in any anime drama to this add that the series makes you feel as if you were also a student of the University where is the setting of the series seeing how it works being a cartoonist or an animator, obviously it does not teach you anything but you feel it. As a spoiler alert, Shino Aki who is the pro Female tagonista stays with the protagonist and they have children, the protagonist managed to change his future from being a loser without a job to finding love and doing what he likes.<br />
<br />
<br />
In general, another anime that is not very redeemable in season.

    I&#039;ll be blunt, ten episodes in and I do not enjoy this show one bit.  Before I lose you all, allow me to explain: It starts off strong, undeniably.  It has a slow burning, but well written 50 minute first episode to provide the setup for the MC Kyoya, and the quality is good for the next two episodes.  From there, however, is all downhill.<br />
<br />
This show has ZERO sense of pacing, scenes fly by and any conflict that feels like it should last for longer than an episode to develop characters who we should become very acquainted with are just dealt with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416330">
        in a matter of a few lines.  It&#039;s a show that seems almost disrespectful of its side characters, we never understand them or their motivations.  In fact, it’s even worse when they become completely irrelevant by the time you get to the last hurdle of the show — they proved to have no impact whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Ironically for a show about creative arts students, it lacks creativity.  The characters almost never do anything without Kyoya getting involved, and for a series with a teacher who seems to be teaching her students to think outside the box (aka like the stereotypical beret wearing art students), this show falls sinfully back on very tacky visual &#039;symbolism&#039; that miss the mark entirely.  The saddest part being that this show looks SO GOOD but is let down by thoroughly weak writing with many, MANY, plot holes and poorly written moments.  Interestingly, some of what I mentioned IS something that is addressed, but good grief it&#039;s executed so horribly that it renders it pointless.  Even then it explores a twist 10 episodes in the making with shocking levels of poorly thought out conversations, character logic, and a situation that’s hardly given the room to breathe.

Remake our Life!<br />
<br />
Note I am not an english speaker therefore this review may contain some errors.<br />
<br />
<br />
I had high expectations of this show. I have been interested for a few years in the art of photography and cinema. I thought that the setting of the show was written for me. The main character, Kyouya , after failing his first video game industry job is thrown back in time 10 years into the past. He then decides to enroll in an art college. The show has promising themes like regret , finding a creative voice or the struggle of creating art etc... Heck, maybe along the way

          <span style="display: none;" id="review412162">
        we will learn more about technical aspects of art. Sadly, the show wasted its premise.<br />
<br />
The show doesn&#039;t really use the premise to its advantage. The main character doesn&#039;t have a goal beyond doing well in school and he doesn&#039;t have anything that he misses or needs. That is how the show wasted the potential themes that it set up in the first episode. And in addition creates a boring character.   <br />
<br />
In addition, sequences in the show flash by in an instance which result in a feeling that things are just happening without any pay off. For example, in one of the episodes, “screenplay dude” gets the wrong camera for the filming. The solution is that the main character learns how to photograph. There are no scenes where the kyuya learns how to photograph or makes any mistakes. We aren&#039;t taught the basics of photography. We are only shown him getting dericons over the phone. And that is the only thing that the show does with the problem, other than more set up. There is no real depth/ build up /consequence to any of the problems. When it does try to raise an interesting personal problem, because of the pacing, the solutions feel unearned.<br />
<br />
There is no reason why the story had to be set in the past. The main character could have just gone to college, found a new job related to video games or made his own game. The only reason was to make a power fantasy.I think the show is somewhat self aware about it. Episode 6(10:00-10:55 and 15:30-16:00) points out good meta points about the show. The fact that the main girls are in love with Kyouya for no reason and that nobody talks in real life like anime characters and that school romance anime sells well.<br />
<br />
 By sending Kyouya to the past he gets some kind of superpower. He is able to know what is successful and use that knowledge to his advantage. I wouldn&#039;t mind this superpower if they did something interesting with it but they only use it as a part of the power fantasy.  I think that the show wants us to be aware that he is from the future but at the same time not. Because if you think about it you would realize that he is dating a girl that is ten years younger than he is.<br />

    Remake My Wish Fulfilment.<br />
<br />
Remake My Life is one of those anime which came out at the right time to the right market. That is, to millennials and gen z-er&#039;s who are all regretting their life/career choices in the midst of a global pandemic, social upheaval and wishing they can go back in time and have a redo.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not the first anime or *sigh* light novel of it&#039;s premise and it certainly won&#039;t be the last so, what makes Remake so special? Well... not a lot really. After being down on his luck Kyouya Hashiba somehow manages to go back 10 years into the past to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417259">
        attend a fancy arts university instead of acquiring the actual useful degree that he achieved so he can more easily break into game industry. Whilst there he discovers that he will be house sharing with 3 (yet to be) famous artists in their field, one of which is his favourite artist from his time period. <br />
Now the first episode is a lengthy 50 minutes long which put me off watching for a while, but I will say that the time was much better utilised than something like &#039;The Detective is already Dead&#039; which came out in the same season (and was worse). After that you will settle into the normal 20 minutes of slice of life, university anime shenanigans. <br />
<br />
The characters are... fine. Honestly, there is nothing too them that you haven&#039;t seen before. Kyouya is a boring, flat, harem protagonist (which he really shouldn&#039;t be considering he is mentally 28), but has enough going for him to not be a total audience insert character. Aki Shino is a moe blob, Nanako Kogure is a ganki girl and Tsurayuki Rokuonji is the brash, but cool best friend type character. Eiko Kawasegawa, a classmate on their course (and Kyouya&#039;s future boss) fills the Tsundere role with a good&#039;ol &quot;It&#039;s not like I did this for you or anything... b b b baka!&quot; <br />
These character archetypes are my biggest problem with the show. University is a completely different experience compared to high school, but these characters simply do not reflect that kind of maturity. In fact the wish fulfilment is strong in this one, but unlike thrash harem or good, horny parody which knows what it is and isn&#039;t taking itself too seriously as a show, Remake My Life takes itself VERY seriously with it&#039;s premise and these pandering, wish fulfilment moments start to ruin our view of the characters and actively takes away from the good moments the show has to offer.<br />
When Kyouya wakes up in his room to find Aki asleep with her face in his crotch (they hadn&#039;t even met yet) and then wakes up to drink day old yogurt out the fridge or when Nanako walks into the room to shout at her friends only to say &quot;What do you mean I&#039;m not wearing clothes? *looks down* AhAHHH!&quot;(she&#039;s 18 -20 by the way) it comes off as the author wanting to eat his cake and fuck it too with one hand holding his pen and the other holding his cock. <br />
<br />
Overall Remake My Life is Mediocre/fine. There are some great moments which did keep me coming back week after week, but eventually it just felt like another high school, slice of life, wish fulfilment anime which I&#039;ve watched a million times before with the caveat being that it&#039;s set in a university. Now apparently a huge twist has happened towards the end of the season, but I&#039;m not particularly invested enough to go back and see what it is. I can definitely see why people are raving about this anime, but for me there are better things to watch.<br />
<br />
... look all I&#039;m saying is Aki should know what a blowjob is.<br />
<br />
5/10 Mediocre
