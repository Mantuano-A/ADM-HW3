“Ishuzoku Reviewers” is PEAK culture. <br />
<br />
If you’ve been a part of this community for a respectable amount of time, it’s no secret that anime has a skeevy underbelly that your average bear isn’t quick

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328038">
        to embrace. But for those of us who have, we can recognize the more scientific appeal of the ecchi. I’m always open to watching the latest ecchi anime, not only for research purposes but because it’s interesting to see just how much further this medium can sink into the depths of depravity. <br />
<br />
Ishuzoku doesn&#039;t exactly move the needle much farther in regards to what I’ve seen come out of the more extreme entries in this genre. Don’t get me wrong, Ishuzoku has a thick oily film on its surface left by a cheeky porno-stached mangaka duo, as all good ecchi should have. However, despite the overtly lascivious draw of its concept and unabashedly lurid presentation, Ishuzoku is actually not without a sense of purpose or self-awareness. <br />
<br />
It flourishes in this strange dichotomy, a plane of existence that teeters between both the politically incorrect and all-encompassing, and it does so with a confounding lack of effort. It indiscriminately acknowledges that people of all shapes and sizes walk the earth and in some form desire copulation. As crazy as it might sound, or as drunk as I might be, this show kind of embraces inclusivity. It’s a stupid show, without a doubt, but it’s stupid in a way that can get you to think critically in ways you may not expect. <br />
<br />
I try to keep my political reservations in check when I consume media, I mean, there are such awful things going on in the world right now that a trio of fantasy characters going around having fantasy sex is pretty damn quaint in my book. Not to diminish the perversity of this show, it is very much so what it advertises itself as. Hell, this is pretty on-brand for what people associate with when it comes to the more fetishistic side of anime. For anyone who on principle dislike ecchi anime, the inherent absurdity of this show’s concept just might be enough of a distraction to the ALMOST pornographic content being portrayed on screen, otherwise, expect an unfettered onslaught of smut, ecchi-fans. <br />
<br />
Another aspect of Ishuzoku that I feel isn’t being addressed in favor of its surface elements is just how gleefully it takes the piss out of review culture. I’m not quite as dedicated or as skilled at writing reviews as most of my peers regularly clocking in their hours on this site, clearly, but I’ve been around. You’ve heard the phrase “different strokes for different folks”, never has that been more aptly applied to anything than with Ishuzoku, and I mean that in a very literal sense. It does such an excellent job of characterizing just how flippantly people will form their opinions and does so with such a sophomoric irreverence that I can’t help but laugh at the deliberate self-seriousness of these characters getting their rocks off. This is serious business to them, and that’s patently ridiculous, but I’m here typing a review for a friggin cartoon about this shit and for the outside looking in that’s probably just as ridiculous. It’s kind of a big fat middle-finger to the pedantic snobbery of people who critique entertainment mediums as serious art-forms, and I say that as someone who’s no stranger to that. <br />
<br />
The real...uhh…“meat” of Ishuzoku’s content comes in the form of the reviews themselves. Stunk, Zel, and Crim all have very different reviewing styles cleverly illustrated by the limitations of their species. As innocuous of a detail as it may seem, the simplicity of having a human struggle to efficiently have sex with something a fraction of his size because he’s too well equipped or the dwarf feeling smothered by the ponderous weight of something more than ten times his size shows me that the writer on top of being a huge pervert is also a bit of a pragmatist. <br />
<br />
Technically speaking, I can’t say that Passione has wiped the slate clean, still, I genuinely enjoy the art-design of this show. The character designs are varied and unique and the world feels surprisingly lived-in which can be the crux for a lot of fantasy anime with middling visuals. The music also isn’t really anything spectacular (not that I expected it to be) although the opening theme is fun and anthemic. <br />
<br />
So, just how long before one of those pearl-clutching vape-juice huffing &quot;columnists&quot; over at AnimeNewsNetwork conjures a stink-piece on how this show actively champions sex-trafficking and perpetuates a narrative of misogyny in-between sips of Pamplemousse La Croix? Ishuzoku isn’t so much the resuscitation of ecchi that so many of us thought it needed as much as it is the legitimizer that fans of this genre have been waiting for. At just 4 episodes, this is already one of the most impressively written ecchi I’ve ever seen, and even setting aside the fact that it proudly wears its ecchi tag as a badge of honor without pretense, there’s enough there that just makes this a really solid anime. It’s meta, it’s relatable, it’s clever, it has heart, it’s funny, and most importantly it respects the genre it owes everything to. <br />

    If big titties and uncensored nipples are going to bother you, find another anime that will Meet Your Standards. And if any children are reading this, GET OUT! <br />
<br />
In this review, I will be analyzing one of the most visceral depictions of lust, desire, and sexuality ever produced. A tragically misunderstood series in twelve volumes that asks controversial questions no other media would dare to ask. Which monster girl is the best fuck?<br />
<br />
I am, of course, talking about Interspecies Reviewers. A story about three legendary men who journey across a fantasy realm on a quest to find the best brothels to enjoy the supple women

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333363">
        on offer, then review them. It is a lot of sex. Elves, fairies, cowgirls, catgirls, demons, and much more. There are succubus women fulfilling a broad range of fetishes. It needs to be remarked, the bewitching bodies of the ladies are drawn to appeal to those of a certain ‘thicc’ disposition. Breasts so big it defies reality, thighs thicker than a queen-sized bed, and fat bootylicious butts. If you want small tits (or none at all) you won’t find what you’re looking for here. For the meat lovers, Interspecies has you covered.  <br />
<br />
To the untrained eye, Interspecies Reviewers may appear like degenerate pseudo-hentai clickbait fodder. But we, the men and lesbicious women of culture know better. Stunk, Zel, and Crim are not merely sex-crazed pussy slayers. They’re pioneers! Trailblazers paving the path for the fetishistic sexual awakenings of the audience. It really rattles my elitism when people say this isn’t a good anime. It’s too lewd, the ladies look too unrealistic, and there’s no substance. To that I say, how dare you for accusing it of entirely true things. What did you expect? It makes its intentions very clear in the first episode. Saying “It’s not anime enough to be a good anime, but not hentai enough to be a good hentai,” is not valid criticism. The meat of this anime is the sex scenes. Going around having sex all the time is pretty much the dream for men with too much testosterone, a dream shared by these three men (+1 guest reviewer). The crew visits a brothel, sometimes multiple brothels, every episode, gets it on, then writes a review. All of them bring different opinions to the table; They describe the ladies, the sex, pros, and cons of their species. The sex scenes are very detailed and animated fluidly. <br />
<br />
These naysayers who publicly denounce Interspecies Reviewers, while probably beating off to other fetishistic hentai, are lost souls. Of course, they wouldn&#039;t appreciate the bouncing uncensored breasts and the bodacious booties of these fine feminine specimens. I&#039;m laughing just imagining those Funimation simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Passione’s animators ejaculate on their cum covered monitors. I pity the fools who are too blind to see the orgasmic artwork. Over here in the real world, there are sex workers. Whether you’re a woman, man, catgirl, or succubi, there’s no shame in it. It’s a very real, but heavily stigmatized, industry. Believe it or not, Interspecies Reviewers is a sex-positive ecchi anime. If you think prostitution and sex work should be illegal, I disagree. <br />
<br />
Most sex workers are pushed toward the profession because they’re unable to pay their rent, pay for their kid’s daycare, or buy food. You make a decent amount of money doing it, way more than you would be working at Walmart. But because prostitution is illegal in most countries (legal in one state in the USA), sex workers are unable to legally hire bodyguards or work from home safely. This means if you are caught protecting a sex worker, you are an accomplice to a crime. If you pay for it, you are a criminal. If you rent out an apartment to a sex worker, you are harboring a criminal. You don’t often hear about cases in which sex workers are murdered due to unsafe conditions (which could easily have been prevented), and suicide due to such a heavy stigma towards them. Imagine living a life so stigmatized that people who jack off to you in private refuse to give you rights, let alone basic human decency, in public. Even though the focus of Interspecies is the three heroes, there are after-credits scenes that feature the ladies discussing their sexual endeavors. It’s much-appreciated humanization for them, reminding us sex workers are people with lives outside of their pornographic presence. <br />
<br />
I wholeheartedly disagree with Funimation, Amazon, and many other channels that decided to cancel Interspecies Reviewers. Considering there’s so much more filth on TV these days, like Eromanga-sensei and Shimoneta, it’s complete hypocrisy that this one got so much hate. The animation is consistently good, the voice acting is great, the dirty jokes are hilarious, and both opening and ending credits are contenders for the best of the year. When the director goes on Twitter and says “I’m going to push the limits of how sexual this can get on television,” I’m not overly surprised that TV stations avoided it like the plague. At the end of the day, this is just a good hentai-lite made with a LOT of love, some may say too much. Interspecies Reviewers may turn many people off due to its themes, but to everyone who just wants a damn good time...<br />
<br />
LET&#039;S GO TO PARADISE!

    I must confess that I am writing this review as a virgin (I&#039;ll let you decide whether I&#039;m a Male or Female).<br />
<br />
&quot;Ishuzoku Reviewers&quot; is the same borderline hentai that we&#039;ve all previously seen and yet, it has gotten a praise beyond belief. It doesn&#039;t offer anything new, it doesn&#039;t try to elevate itself and it looks ugly (as usual) so why the love then?<br />
<br />
It appears this anime portrays every man&#039;s dream. A dream everyone has had at one point of life. Fucking all them bitches because yes, the female portraying is the usual although here it&#039;s slightly pushed to the next level. Every female here

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333233">
        is destined to work as a prostitute and I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve seen a single character opposed to this cruelty. They like it and that&#039;s all the explanation we got.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ishuzoku Reviewers&quot; isn&#039;t really good and one of the main reasons is the sex, it&#039;s main subject matter. It&#039;s hentaish and you know what that means... it sucks. For some reason every sex scenes in anime doesn&#039;t work too well whereas in manga it does. If this was a manga instead I might have liked it but because it&#039;s in an anime i&#039;ve FELT a level of disgust to watching it. I&#039;ve seen a lot of hentai and there&#039;s only one that was decently made but that was because of its story, in &quot;Ishuzoku Reviewers&quot; that&#039;s not the case since there&#039;s not story. Stuff happens throughout the show but it leads to nowhere... well that&#039;s not exactly true since everything leads towards sex and our guy, Rance&#039;s older brother Stunk who will take care of them pusss, amirite!?! Jesus o lord I ask your forgiveness for having seen this abomination.<br />
<br />
The characters are weird. Their design seem to be coming from hell itself. Especially the females. Because there are so many it&#039;s hard to draw them properly and it leads to some creepy looking ones. Christ, I&#039;ve seen a 70 years old naked and she&#039;s pounded by a kid. Now yes, he&#039;s over 200 years old but because the age here is out of charge It&#039;s hard to know how old someone might be or not. Unless they&#039;re explicitly mentioned there&#039;s not way of knowing a kid has been infiltrated there to fuck some chicks... for whatever reason... Someone please call Chris Hansen.<br />
<br />
The worst part of the anime is the sex duration. We don&#039;t actually get a specific time of its duration but it&#039;s pretty clear that the main characters has been having sex everyday multiple times which leads me think, is that even possible considering one of them is a human? Because, if it&#039;s based in real-life then it shouldn&#039;t be possible for a human being. For the other characters, it&#039;s hard to tell since they&#039;re a different race but i&#039;m sure there&#039;s a limit. It&#039;s not you can go and bust out at any given time, amirite? I know what are you asking? But why? I want it to be realistic, that&#039;s why. What we get to see is definitely not that. In the anime seems like the main characters can have sex all day whereas that&#039;s not possible especially for the human dude. He&#039;s the one with the most screentime and yet, we get to see him all day smashing everyone.<br />
<br />
The animation was probably the best i&#039;ve seen in hentai, period. Unfortunately we&#039;re cursed to having always bad animation in them since even if they had a great animation no one would contribute to buying anything related to that. It&#039;s one of the reason why stuff like &quot;Ishuzoku Reviewers&quot; exists so people could actually spend some money on. Ultimately, I won&#039;t be the one spending for this crap.<br />
<br />
Look, I like hentai (a few of them) but in anime they never get portrayed accurately. In the manga is much better, at least in perspective. Whoever draws them know how the body autonomy works. The animators clearly don&#039;t.  Moreover, borderline hentai has no future. Either you turn into a full hentai or you go with ecchi. There isn&#039;t a middle section nor will be one. Just, FYI.<br />
<br />
Go watch Rance 01 if you want something decent. Its one of my all-time favorites.

    You know, I was fully intending to slap a 10/10 on this review for the memes as well as to garner some petty attention, but you know what? I’m actually gonna be completely real with you guys about my thoughts on Interspecies Reviewers. Yeah, I know that reading some comedic satire would have been more fun for you, but I’m gonna take a show about intercourse with anime monster babes seriously!!! It’s always good to joke around and have fun with scores since everyone’s entitled to their own opinions and can rate things however they want (Wow, it’s sad that I have to state the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333284">
        obvious, but here we are!), but if Interspecies Reviewers has taught us anything with both its in-anime reviews AND real life scores, people actually give a damn about the authenticity of ratings and often use them to make decisions and sway their views on what’s being analyzed, no matter how ridiculous the material may be.<br />
<br />
But wow, who would have thought that the anime of the season would be about some sleazy dudes getting it on with monster girls!<br />
<br />
Now hold up, before you roll your eyes at this statement and label me an untrustworthy perverted degenerate (which I’m not denying but…moving on!), I’m not trying to incite that Interspecies Reviewers is a great anime by any means, because it clearly isn’t. It’s unique for sure in that it crosses all pre-established bounders for ecchi anime and wasn’t afraid to notch up its perversion to levels previously unheard of for anime of its genre. For that I commend Interspecies Reviewers for being brave, bold, and…quite sexy. However, despite the abundance of unique monster girls featured each week for our protagonists to bang, the anime didn’t captivate me as much as I initially anticipated. I don’t want to say it got repetitive, but upon reflecting, the formula for each episode is nearly identical with the exception being the species that is being reviewed. This is perfectly fine if you’re into the featured girls. I admittedly had a good time with the, uh…birdmaids, golems, and…n-never mind! I’m not revealing anymore or my fetishes! But the problem is that when the monster girls of the week aren&#039;t that interesting to the viewer, which unfortunately happened to me on several occasions, the experience becomes as bland as watching a bad hentai that you know will be garbage but you have nothing better to do with your pathetic life, so you watch it anyway. Wait, that’s just me? Well…moving on!<br />
<br />
Of course under normal circumstances, an anime like this would probably just be watched by a small assortment of men of culture and then quietly fade to background as time went on. But in this situation, there was a whole uproar surrounding this anime that started with Funimation dropping it entirely which then spiraled into a sequence of events that led Interspecies Reviewers to become the most relevant show this season. And that is why it is the anime of the Winter 2020 season, because of the sheer impact that it has had on the entire anime community.<br />
<br />
I would talk a little more in depth about my thoughts on the whole Interspecies Reviewers fiasco, but screw it, you&#039;re not here for that! You&#039;re here for the real MEAT of the show, aren&#039;t ya? And I don’t mean the story, because let’s be real, there really isn’t one. No, I mean the juicy PLOT of the anime, if ya get me~ But yeah, it’s a decent show overall that follows an assortment of characters who write reviews discussing the quality of a wide variety of luscious monster girls. It’s basic but can be fun for anyone who just wants to have a good time and see some sexy comedic situations with interesting characters.<br />
<br />
The main characters themselves are a laid back group of adventures who, unlike 99% of anime protagonists, actually get the girl. Or in this case I should say girls. Cuz they have sex with practically anything that breaths and has female parts. No wait, they’ve done it with creatures that lack both of these so…I guess they’ll bang anything that moves? Anyway, they’re a fun loving bunch whose antics were enjoyable to watch for the most part. Stunk and Zel are complete perverts, which is a trait that I enjoy in characters as long as it’s implemented appropriately. Crim ended up as the most entertaining of the main trio for me due to his shyness and general awkwardness. It was just amusing to watch honestly. Yes, they lack depth and intrigue, but the only bit of quality that I care about when it comes to them are their monster girl reviews! These sexy succubus sluts don’t really have a lot of character, but they have LOADS of PERSONALITY, ya get me~? And there’s so many of them, they just kept CUMMING, ya know~? Now these girls are actually the most vital part of the anime, because the lewdness involving them is literally the only reason why anyone would watch this anime, and if you say otherwise, you’re either lying to me or yourself. I’d have to say that I was impressed with the sheer variety of monster girls. The author must of really did his research! I ultimately enjoyed the uniqueness of a lot of the girls and it helped to elevate this series to be above average in my eyes.<br />
<br />
I’m of course mandated by the anime reviewing kami-sama to give my output on who I think is best girl. So I’d like to congratulate Meidri for being in my humble opinion the hottest chick of the bunch! No wait, I guess the fiery salamander girl is technically the hottest, but…anyway! Meidri wins the award of best designed girl from me as I just find her aesthetic to be quite alluring. 9/10 would watch her lay eggs again. Well, this just got disturbing, so…moving on!<br />
<br />
The aesthetics are the best part of the show. While there isn’t any flashy animation or breathtaking effects, there are hella cute anime girl designs, so all is right in the world. I believe that this is the best visual work that Studio Passione has done thus far, and the way the characters are drawn is just so appealing. Good thing too, because the enjoyability of hentai…and this anime…really bank on the quality of their visuals. Cuz I mean let’s be honest, we are here to ogle hot anime monster girls after all! And I can say with confidence that the girls generally look great. The sound work is standard, though I did get some lols out of the lyrics to the theme songs. Where the sound department truly shines is in it’s voice acting. The seiyuu have to moan and squeal like they’re getting the icky sticky contents of a long, thick bottle of mayonnaise squirted all over their bodies. Ad you know what? They really sell it. Maybe a little too much sometimes, but hey, I’ll take overacting when it comes to cute anime girl noises.<br />
<br />
So to conclude, I have to say that while I think that Interspecies Reviewers is a fun ecchi, I personally wasn’t as entertained by it as most cultured anime connoisseurs, though I still ended up having a good time with it. I guess I just wanted to see some more fleshed out characters. Yes, even if this is just an ecchi anime I still would have loved to see some depth, who would&#039;ve thought? But I will say that if you’re looking for something sexy and fun, then give Interspecies Reviewers a shot. You might even end up discovering a lewd fetish deep within yourself that you didn’t know existed!<br />
<br />
Just…keep it to yourself if you do. It’s probably best that way.

    Well, this anime is crazy.<br />
<br />
The story is about 3 buddies going around to have sex everywhere possible with different species of creatures. Such as demons, monsters, elves, angels, ghosts as well as legendary creatures I had never heard of before. They have sex with them so that they know how the experience differs from each creature to another and they review them and publish their reviews in a bar so that people know whether or not it is advised to have sex with these creatures. But in a very exciting and funny way, as hell. Plus they get paid for it! You will see things

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328035">
        about sex you have never seen before, and porn clips you haven&#039;t seen in any anime before (except in Hentai, of course). Milk, giant breasts and nipples, gays and lesbians, hybrid creatures that have both sexual organs, different sexual positions, many things that I cannot say in order not to spoil you.<br />
<br />
The characters are not at all special, but they are as funny as hell. Just imagine with me 3 buddies reviewing brothels, what will the events be like, the situations and the reactions, you will laugh and get excited like never before. I recommend it to you from here before the end. We have Crimvael who is an angel who meets Stunk and Zel while he&#039;s about to be killed by a giant monster but the two save him. Crimvael asks them to stay with them until he is healed so that he can return to heaven and they accept that, but only if he takes them with him when he heals so they can fuck angels. The two tell him what they do, I mean, reviewing bitches, and so he becomes their partner. Zel hates elves, especially the older ones, while Stunk loves them because he is human and thus cannot distinguish whether they are old or not since they do not grow old even if they are 500 years old. The interactions between these three are hilarious especially because each one of them has a different taste in girls so they always argue wich girl is the best.<br />
<br />
Music is not such a thing, the soundtrack is not something to remember, but the opening is great. At least I liked it because it set the mood for the episode.<br />
<br />
Animation may seem bad to you at first, but when the fan service starts, you just can&#039;t get your eyes off it. The worldbuilding is cool and it gives the atmosphere of a fantasy world. the character design is okay and bit ironic sometimes.<br />
<br />
To be honest with you, the anime does not focus on any topic that may benefit you in your life or anything like that, it is just a crazy comic and fun story. Perhaps the majority will find it ridiculous, and I understand that because I was one of them. But when thinking about that, I think it is not necessary that the anime should be meaningful and beneficial in order to enjoy it, because pleasure does not come in one way but rather in many different ways, so the fun will not be the same. My advice, just ignore most of the flaws you will notice, ignore the critical side of you, be open and try to enjoy as much as you can.<br />
<br />
Overall, this anime is really fun, and unique, I have never really seen any Ecchi anime like this before, and it will probably be the best one that has been produced so far. If you are a fan of this stuff, then run to it now, if you don&#039;t have experience with this stuff or don&#039;t like them, I advise to stay away from it, but if you want to get into them, this is the best start. So GO!

    Well we did it, we have a show that embodies diminishing returns and makes ass, tits, and the idea of sex such a dull experience. <br />
<br />
It’s not the content&#039;s fault, that’s ok for what it is, but it’s more on how repetitive the structure of the show is. With mostly every episode focusing on one or two different types of girls or activity, and making a few sentence review of their brothel excursion. It is obviously a more episodic show, but none of the events really stand out from one another. Most of them are so interchangeable with only the minuscule of detail making them

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333232">
        watchable in chronological order if there is any at all. This comes down to most of them just being just downright forgettable with the only memorable ones being the weird ones like the egg laying one.<br />
<br />
Hell it doesn’t even stop at the structure of the show, a lot of the “sex” scenes are repetitive as well.  It’s obvious that they have only so much wiggle room, but come on. Just a bunch of girls touching themselves, girls focused from belly up bouncing up and down,  a bunch of innuendo for fornication, and a couple camera pans to boot. There are only a few moments where they step a bit past the line to make it look like out right sex, but it’s still few and far between. None of this would really bother me, but I just happen to notice them because there’s very little else interesting going on.<br />
<br />
Down to it, the fact one-dimensional characters boinking highly feminized one-dimensional fantasy species in a nondescript psuedo-european fantasy setting doesn’t suit my fancy. Or maybe it doesn’t because the act of them “doing it” really isn’t that titillating or entertaining.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are ecchi shows that are more hardcore than this show, and hentai that are just as softcore. And if you are reading this, then you obviously have access to them and are more deserving of your wasted time and genital juice.  While this show isn’t bad if you look at it from the appropriate perspective, there’s nothing in it that makes it above being average at best.<br />
<br />
Also if you are wondering why i kept up with this show anyway. It’s because crim is a cutie pie ;)<br />

    Disclaimer: This show is one of those special shows that the viewer needs to know what they are getting into and what to expect. I still never understand how people complain about the amount of ecchi scenes in a show that is clearly filled with fan-service ecchi from the get go.<br />
<br />
Interspecies Reviewer (or at least the first four episodes) is a joy to watch for any fan of fan service ecchi shows. There are countless times while watching this show that my jaw has dropped because the show took it to places I couldn’t have even comprehended, and it’s amazing, simply amazing. It’s one of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328112">
        those shows that makes you say “Man... I love Japan.”<br />
The show’s animation and visuals look amazing. <br />
The OP and ED are excellent and I could never imagine skipping either. The OP is especially awesome, and it is probably on my top anime openings of all time.<br />
Lastly, the characters are all lovable and enjoyable as they go on their quest to review the various brothels. The two lead characters are both great and the banter between them is always a treat.<br />
<br />
Anime watchers looking at this show need to keep in mind, this show is as borderline into crossing into hentai as possible, and if that does not interest you, simply don’t watch this show. You won’t like it. This show is for me and my fellow degenerates who are fans of the fan service in shows and only focus on the “important stuff”. <br />
If you are the type of person to complain about the amount of ecchi fan service a show has, don’t watch shows that are entirely focused on them. However, if you are someone who is a fan of that sort of stuff, this show will be everything you want and more... much much more

    Do you know what it’s like to sleep with different female creatures? Do you know which species give you the best pleasure? Ever wanted to know what kinks and fetishes suit you best? Well, there’s one group of sex-crazed guys that can give you horny bastards an answer.<br />
<br />
Welcome to the most culturally PEAK and most sexual show of 2020 (and maybe of all time). A show that first flew under most people’s radars, but soon exploded in what became one of the most unexpected and controversial shows to air, causing a ripple of discussion, memes, and changes to flow throughout the anime community and here

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333244">
        on MAL. <br />
<br />
When we think of ecchi, we think of flashing tits, “accidental” groping, the Monogatari toothbrush scene, walking in on your crush getting changed, and lesbian couples stranded on an island French kissing &amp; pleasuring each other to turn into powerful weapons. We truly had some good ecchi series that aired in the past that provided us with good fan service, but this show takes ecchi to the extreme in terms of how far they can push the limits of what they’re allowed to air on TV. Comparing this series to the manga, the manga is tame in comparison. The manga doesn’t have ANY nudity or sex scenes, so the director decides to bless us by going far and beyond what the manga has done so far to make this series what it is today, even catching the censors in Japan off-guard. Seeing how the show is borderline hentai, in terms of ecchi and fan service, this show takes the cake as being one of the best in the genre. <br />
<br />
There isn’t much of a story in this show, only loosely-connected plot points that allow the series and characters to develop and continue after each episode. This show is very episodic in nature and the premise of the show is quite simple; it’s about the gang heading to different brothels to experience different types of species and fetishes. I can say that the world building is also quite good for an ecchi series, seeing how the main cast of characters are adventurers, having to fight different monsters and go to distant lands to visit new brothels. <br />
<br />
The comedy in this show is incredibly funny and oftentimes vulgur. This show also is both politically correct and incorrect when exploring different topics about human nature and the body, and different groups of people. What I mean by that is when exploring very crude and used-to-be unspoken topics in media such as intercourse, sex &amp; gender, body types, size, age, fetishes, and races, the show pushes these discussion points and issues into the limelight and without hesitation of backing off or pandering to minority groups or the Twitterati, and instead they embrace them and use them to portray a message of inclusivity, body positivity and giving the TV censors the middle finger. <br />
<br />
However, there were quite a few people who probably aren’t as knowledgeable on anime, especially what to expect of an ecchi series (especially this one), that were outraged or triggered by the show’s “apparent” portrayal of prostitution and female body types, even if they&#039;re out of proportion (it&#039;s fiction and it&#039;s not representative of real life) – most likely just for the sake of being outraged and gaining brownie points online *cough cough* ANN. You would surely expect to see different body types if a show was all about exploring the idea of having sex with prostitutes of different body types and species. The producers and the show take jabs at different groups of people such as critics and reviewers. If you’ve seen South Park, then you might have seen the “You’re Not Yelping” episode; this anime somewhat parodies what that episode focused on (watch it if you haven’t, season 19, episode 4). <br />
<br />
A good ecchi show isn’t complete without a good set of characters. The main trio of reviewers are Crim, Stunk and Zel; characters with different tastes and preferences and who are of different species. They are often joined by another side character when they enter a different brothel, though there are some good and sometimes funny side character inside the bar and some brothels who have their moments. One factor that makes the cast and show so interesting are the different scenarios they are put in and the struggles and limitations of having sex with certain species or viewing different perverted and often disturbing stuff. One example is having sex with someone who is many times smaller than you, another is when the group head to an egg-laying brothel, which for the main trio, they felt very uncomfortable, whilst snake species and mermen highly enjoyed it, as they can purchase the freshly-laid eggs that are auctioned off. Their interactions with each other as well as the show’s comedy is funny, adding more to their character dynamics. It’s great to see them arguing amongst each other about which type of girl is best, as well as the show’s self-deprecation and character’s self-awareness. The OP &amp; ED are alright as well, they’re more like meme songs just added with a lot of nudity, and the opening is very similar to YMCA by Village People.<br />
<br />
I honestly think Passione has done a great job of taking the reins and adapting the manga, even taking the extra steps in adding a shitload of hentai-esk material and fan service whilst staying true to the manga. The art style is clean and the animation during the action and sex/ecchi scenes were nicely and smoothly animated. It’s clear that the studio took great pride (if they have any left) and passion when creating the show, and if they keep up that level of care and quality, you can hopefully look forward to future projects such as High School DxD season 5 (hopefully soon) or another season of this show. Maybe it’s a good idea to keep Passione on your radar for future projects.<br />
<br />
If I have to choose what the best episode of the series is, and what would rival most top-tier ecchi series, then I would have to go with the gender bender episode (ep.3), as that left me in a state of shock and confusion and with an erection wondering as to how something that great was allowed to air on TV, it’s also what lead to creating all of the controversy and de-platforming. Make sure you watch it uncensored for all of its glory. Overall, I think this a marvellous adaptation of what is an alright manga. This show is perfect for any ecchi-loving degenerate such as myself to watch, make sure you lock your door and plug in your headphones when watching the crazy ride that is Interspecies Reviewers.<br />
Overall score: 9/10

    In this next edition of “I can’t believe it’s not hentai,” we have a show that takes a bold new direction while also not being ashamed for what it is, Interspecies reviewers. A new ecchi comedy by studio Passione and is a show for the true men and women of culture. A truly intellectual show that asks some important questions. Questions that can shape the very nature of humanity and bring forth a golden age of wisdom and enlightenment.<br />
<br />
Of course, what I’m saying is absolute bo***cks and what we actually have here is probably the most crass/raunchy anime I have ever watched. It really does

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328078">
        have no shame about what it is and has no intention of hiding it. Which is a good thing because it only means you won’t be hiding anything (except a couple of things for obvious reasons) and fully embracing it. That takes guts which studio Passione has plenty with them showcasing everything Interspecies reviewers has to offer so far. <br />
<br />
But what is Interspecies reviewers about? Well, it is about our main leads Stunk, Zel and Crim experiencing what every species of girls has to offer...in the brothels that are scattered around the town. From there, our characters go into the brothels, experience what they have to offer and review the experience. That sets the structure for every episode where our characters experience what’s it’s like to have sex with these, “Succugirls” as the show calls them and review it. But it isn’t just the same species reviewing them because our main leads are different species with Stunk being a human, Zel being an elf and Crim being an angel (yes you read that right, an angel having sex in a brothel). So the experience will be different due to the characters being different species as well as different tastes. For example, Stunk might have a better time having sex with an elf due to her sex appeal and experience. But Zel might not like it because he is having sex with an elf that is 500 years old. So there has actually been thought into how experience get reviewed with everyone&#039;s different tastes. <br />
<br />
Now this show does teeter on the line between being an ecchi series and a full blown hentai with its visuals. If not crossing it. While it doesn’t show full blown nudity that would warrant it becoming a hentai. It does comes damn close. Episode three especially has imagery that would make you go, “Woah, are they really doing this?” Well if you watched the uncensored that is (like a proper person of culture), otherwise you would have to experience a black screen with the words “Please enjoy the scene without the visuals.”  It’s impressive though that the staff working on this show managed to do this and push some boundaries while making sure that it is an ecchi anime. Beside from that, the show does look good. It’s colourful and vibrant with the character designs  of the Succugirls having plenty of sex appeal to make them desirable. This is definitely important because for an ecchi series, you have to make them cute and sexy and this show definitely does that. Soundtrack wise, there isn’t exactly much but is good to setting a scene with an emphasis on music to know it’s sexy time. Although going back to listen to it, It is surprisingly varied  although can be basic in order to maintain a light hearted tone. <br />
<br />
So after four episodes, I’m curious see how this show continues on. We have already seen some nutty stuff and apparently, it’s just going to get wilder from here. Of course, that could just leave the show constantly trying to one up itself and failing in the process. But besides that, this show has been by far one of the most entertaining shows this season for me. It’s raunchy as all hell and might turn people off immediately after watching episode one. But I found it really enjoyable and something I can just sit back and enjoy the ride. So if your curious, check this one out. Just make sure you watch the uncensored version and you watch it alone okay? <br />
<br />
First impressions <br />
Story: 6/10<br />
It is a basic plot and expands on it with each episode. <br />
Characters: 7/10<br />
They lack depth but they are defined enough and their chemistry with one another is great. <br />
Animation: 7/10 <br />
Bright, colourful and has plenty of sex appeal. Yep, definitely done good here. <br />
Sound: 5/10<br />
It is basic but it is varied and the opening and ending is fun to watch and listen to watch. <br />
My personal enjoyment: 10/10<br />
Yeah, I’m loving every minute of this show with it being funny and very sexy at the same time. <br />
<br />
Overall score: 7.0/10 Recommendation: Watch it<br />

    Ecchi anime are generally shallow. I&#039;ve seen my fair share of ecchi anime (and even some hentai anime) and they rarely ever amount to anything spectacular. It&#039;s mostly junk food, quick and easy but unfulfilling a few hours later and ultimately forgotten the next day. Ishuzoku Reviewers is the 7-course Michelin-Starred dining experience of ecchi anime, served with a rotation of wines for each meal. It is genuinely a fancy dining experience unlike any other.<br />
<br />
To start, the show is actually funny. I really mean it, not in the lowest-common denominator &quot;Rito-kun no harenchi!&quot; stuff, but actual humour with comedic timings and actual jokes. It is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333237">
        for my money the funniest show of the season by quite a fair margin, with a good blend of low brow and high brow humour to go along. <br />
<br />
For an ecchi anime, hell no, for a fantasy anime, it has a surprising amount of world-building and intertia to the setting and characters. Stunk and friends are actually characters and they receive characterization and character development as the series goes along. Adding to that the main characters (+1 rotating guest) are very likable characters indeed, from their mannerisms to their personality quirks, it&#039;s never a dull moment with them onscreen. The character dynamics and relationships are also nothing short of entertaining. The various secondary characters the reviewers meet each episode is also a treat, you&#039;ll never know who you&#039;ll meet next. It really lends a sense of adventure to the show which keeps it fresh every week to see how they can top themselves.<br />
<br />
I know this all sounds like shallow praise, but trust me, you don&#039;t know how many shows I&#039;ve watched (not even ecchi stuff, I&#039;m talking proper fantasy anime) can&#039;t even approach this level of care and detail for its world and characters. It&#039;s far too likely to pluck some Joe Average from the real world and toss him into Isekailand to form harems and fight monsters. So to see a show that actually tries (and succeeds!) at giving us likable characters in a setting that is portrayed with a considerable amount of detail (hell the series goes all out to show that the world functions in a proper representative democracy of all things) is something to appreciate in it of itself. <br />
<br />
And what a wild ride this show has been. From the YMCA OP to the mythical Taiwanese broadcasts to all the cancellations on assorted TV networks and it still goes strong. The whole ongoings behind the scenes is simply a wild ride in it of itself and I&#039;m glad to have experience this whole madness live. It hasn&#039;t reached Yosuga no Sora&#039;s level of challenging Japanese TV censorship laws levels of infamy yet, but who knows what this series will bring even after the final episode. <br />
<br />
Finally, despite its subject matter and its nature as an ecchi show, it surprisingly has a mature air to it, treating its subject matter with a lot of class and respect. Again, it&#039;s not the standard cheap shots at panties or walking into a shower scene like in many other ecchi shows, but it&#039;s the protagonists partaking in the activities provided by the ladies of the night. Which is where I plucked the 7-course meal fancy dining metaphor early on. A magnificent showpiece with a ton of variety at every moment. Just an exquisite experience.<br />
<br />
As the OP puts it: Sukebe ga daisuki!<br />
<br />
<br />

    If you’re a person of culture, then this is the apex of anime you’ve been searching all your life for. Some might consider this a borderline Hentai, but a wise man once said,”Hentai is an art expressed in its rawest and purest form.” If this was not meant to be, then god himself would not have given us such a gift! I dare say this is an even better adaptation than the manga! It’s a testament to all us weebs, otakus, veteran watchers, and even the casual anime fanatic’s faith that we were bestowed such a miracle in our time of need. <br />
<br />
Now I get

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328279">
        skepticism might be shown such as,” you’re just a degenerate” and I say quite possibly yes! But I’m one with taste. You see my children, we are only blessed with such a fine and unwavering adaption in every aspect of the word unwavering only every couple of thousand. I have shifted through the endless seas of anime trash to bring to you this holy grail. I parted the red seas of isekai, walked across the lakes mecha, I changed yaoi to yuri and vice versa because I can! Some of you may think that the ecchi genre has died so what’s the point? I tell you this! Heros never truly die, but even so that’ll be resurrected soon enough. For all of you who have yet to see this for the masterpiece it truly is, you definitely need some kind of healing. Unfortunately my powers only go so far. Hopefully one day you’ll find that scrumptious doctor. Now most importantly, of all that I have achieved to get this far, I have never left anyone without the sauce, you shall never be lost in my care.<br />

After hearing about my trials and tribulations to unearth such an underrated godsend this season,let’s get into why you really want to watch this. So.. what are you missing out on? I’m not gonna lie when I say this has some juicy plot. Is there anything more touching than seeing adventures on their mission to protect what’s truly important to them?  I say nigh! Why almost? Because these aren’t just your average run-of-the-mill protagonists looking to slay a demon lord oh no. These are the kind looking to do a far greater justice... do you know the horrors of going into a brothel and not knowing what you’re getting yourself into? Because I don’t, but with this highly educational anime we won’t need to! These heros are on a mission to visit every monster girl brothel known and unknown! To smash where no person has smashed before. I dare say one day their research may even save lives! These are, the Ishuzoku Reviewers. <br />
<br />
“Doesn’t this get repetitive and boring?” You must have been watching the show with your eyes closed and your ears plugged. If you can’t watch anything with ecchi and refuse to believe anything good can come from it, let’s agree to disagree. There’s a PLETHORA of waifus in this show! and everyone knows if you watch anime at all you have to at least have one. You like Minotaur girls, this might be for you! Lactose intolerant? No problem! It’s even got the fan favorites, cat girls! There’s even ones to suit the more.. exotic tastes.. with all the myriad beings there’s going to be at least one that finds it special place in your heart. Or make you pick up a bible. There’s really no in between. <br />
<br />
“I’ve also heard this show gets very.. intense to say the least..” and you’d be right! However the white rains that could cure Africa’s drought that would be depicted in a hentai are nowhere to be seen! I do recommend headphones or to be alone if you’re more of an introvert otherwise it’s a great bonding experience with others! Have a friend who wants to get into anime and have already recommended them boku no pico? Try this! There’s also monster musume and freezing which are gems in their own respect.

    With the big fuss erupting around this, I figured I&#039;d check it out. I dislike when self-appointed moral guardians decide to impose their &#039;standards&#039; on grown adults and I was half-inclined to give this a 10 just on principle. <br />
<br />
But then I watched it.<br />
<br />
And, oh boy. It is not good. Like... it&#039;s really bad. <br />
<br />
I think this has enough conceptual meat for maybe a ten minute short and then the joke at the core of the premise is completely played out. As far as mockeries of isekai and fantasy anime tropes go, this is a pretty poor offering. It lacks even the tiniest of fractions

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328732">
        of the humour and charm of something like Konosuba. I think my mouth might have twitched in the direction of a smile once or twice, but there were no laughs here.<br />
<br />
So does it work on any other levels? Well the plot is thin, the characters only loosely sketched, and honestly, I don&#039;t care about any of them. So you can forget story and character.<br />
<br />
But surely, with the all the talk of it being borderline hentai, it&#039;s at least decent ecchi? No... it really isn&#039;t. It&#039;s about as stimulating as watching rhinos fuck on a nature documentary. I mean, hey, if that does it for you, all power to you. But yeah, this did nothing for me.<br />
<br />
I think in part the above is because I just don&#039;t enjoy the art style at play here. In fact about the only thing I find decent is the OP which is reasonably catchy. <br />
<br />
So yeah, I think Funimation&#039;s censorship shenanigans are pretty shitty, but I&#039;m not sure this was the hill to die on when it comes fighting moral panics and their instigators. It&#039;s, simply put, a struggle to watch.

    I never thought the day would come where I would write a review about an anime that&#039;s all about guys writing sex reviews (with girls from different species nonetheless).<br />
Now, what can I say about this masterpiece that surprisingly isn&#039;t a hentai? <br />
It&#039;s absolutely PHENOMENAL ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <br />
<br />
Ishuzoku Reviewers is without a doubt the best Ecchi I have ever seen and will probably keep this spot for eternity, and it has a really good reason for this. This anime isn&#039;t afraid of displaying or showing what others may consider &quot;too fucked up&quot;, it simply has no limits and it&#039;s exactly this that makes it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333274">
        just so damn good. <br />
<br />
Ishuzoku Reviewers completely exceeded my expectations. When I first read the synopsis and saw the first trailer, I instantly knew that this anime was going to be great, but boy I wasn&#039;t expecting it to be this good. <br />
<br />
The story is about some fine gentlemen reviewing sex with girls from different species. That&#039;s it. This is without a doubt the best story that I&#039;ve seen in an anime ever. Period.<br />
<br />
Now for the art... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <br />
Ishuzoku Reviewers has two different versions; the uncensored version and the censored version. I personally have only seen the uncensored version because let&#039;s be real... Uncensored &gt; Censored. Just who wouldn&#039;t want to see some big ol&#039; uncensored cow girl anime tiddies am I right? <br />
Anyways, the art style is fucking amazing. Just absolutely everything about it is brilliant, from the main characters, to the monster girls to the phenomenal sex scenes. It&#039;s fucking GORGEOUS. (Bubulala is also the most beautiful girl. Change my mind).<br />
<br />
The sound is also fucking perfect. I mean, who doesn&#039;t love some moaning from girls from a bunch of different species. The voice actors all did a phenomenal job and I congratulate them for this.<br />
<br />
Out of the other hundreads of animes I&#039;ve seen, I&#039;ve only given one other anime a solid 10/10 (Made In Abyss for those of you curious), but now I can proudly say that I found a worthy contender for that 10/10 anime throne and that of course would be no other anime than Ishuzoku Reviewers. &lt;3

    This anime is brilliant. Finally a show about the real enjoyment of a fantasy world. Anyone denying that is probably denying their sexuality as a whole, but that grade of immaturity is expected in the current situation.<br />
<br />
The story is about 3 people reviewing different brothels each episodes of different species, while making money of the reviews they write each time afterwards. Their reviews are always genuine with attention to detail of what might impact the score from a human/elv or angel.<br />
<br />
The Art is very erotic and high quality. Animation is as fluid as it should be in 2020 and everything you expect to be animated

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328633">
        is.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t really pay attention to the soundtrack, but it&#039;s definitely not bad. Also the opening and especially the ending are absolute bangers. I love to listen to them anytime I can, they&#039;re totally perfect and hype-inducing.<br />
<br />
The characters are well written and have nuances for their respectiv species. The dynamic between the main cast is also very enjoyable, since they play off of each other in a funny, entertaining way.<br />
<br />
My enjoyment from this show is very high up until now and I hope it stays that way. <br />
Overall a 10/10 so far. I hope it stays that way.

    Coming from the manga, I am even happier this got adapted, and there is an uncensored version, its like monster musume season two but better.<br />
<br />
Story 8\10<br />
our group goes around and reviews brothels, a simple set up but pretty unique and does the job well. Many echii anime don&#039;t touch brothels for the sake of the MC needing to have a harem but this anime you straight need cash, which is kinda realistic in a sad way but true and a good twist. Story pacing is nice and honestly good comedy that flows naturally.<br />
Art 8\10<br />
Animation is good, titties got good bounce and the girls are all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328313">
        animated great, its pretty good and honestly with the uncensored version this is not practically, but actually is just a straight hentai.<br />
Sound 6.5\10<br />
Music is subjective, but the op sounds like YMCA and the ending is fun to watch as well. However the music besides that is just your standard songs besides a select few but we are not too far into the anime yet.<br />
Characters 8.5\10<br />
I mean they still have more personality then the normal MC and are able to be funny, all reviewers and our MC not only have traits distinguishable to them, but also play off each other perfectly. Besides them its nothing much but the girls are all pretty great but again, not there for long.<br />
Enjoyment 10\10<br />
This is the new guilty pleasure anime of the decade so kissxsis better move over lol. I love this anime, made me laugh like konosuba, opening hypes you up and the girls are all great more hot monster girls is great. for an echii anime its a top 5 up there with high school dxd as one of the best and I only see it getting better and better.<br />
Overall 8\10<br />
This is currently an 8 but ill add more halfway through the series and adjustments, but this anime will be a cult classic remembered for a long time, and I think many echii lovers are sleeping on it. I recommend it to anyone who loves echii for sure. Also funimation decided to cancel the dub because of twitter puritans so the anime gotta be worth watching. <br />
Actually, this anime is worth a 10 considering everything new it does

    In the West, Anime and Manga are often conflated with Hentai. This is because of their often use of pervy jokes, skimpy and risque outfits, and at times, even nudity. So generally, the medium is looked at as a perverted one. This is due to the differing values between Japan and the West. While the West is more than happy to show violence, killing, and gore, sexual things are often considered taboo. This is the exact opposite of Japan; sexual subject matter is fine, as it&#039;s a natural thing we all feel. While violence is often censored or used sparingly. These cultural differences are why

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333344">
        there are a multitude of Anime and Manga with at least some sexual content.<br />
<br />
Then, there is of course the Ecchi genre that&#039;s dedicated to all things pervy. There&#039;s a pretty wide spectrum for the genre; series that are fairly mild all the way to being borderline Hentai. You start with more mild series like Food Wars and Fairy Tail with quick and often censored shots, then up to series like Highschool DxD and To Love Ru where boob flashes and groping are commonplace, finally all the way up to the extreme envelop-pushing Prison School and Shimoneta. I personally never thought something would eclipse Shimoneta or Prison School, but once again, Japan has surpassed my expectations and introduced us to perverted masterpiece that is Interspecies Reviewers.<br />
<br />
Interspecies Reviewers was so perverted and rife with controversial material, it was dropped by its English licensor Funimation and even multiple Japanese television stations. But make no mistake, this series is a titillating tour de force.<br />
<br />
Here we follow Stunk, a Human male, and Zel, a male Elf as they go on a quest to sleep with every kind of species in the wide and diverse world they inhabit. They accomplish this task by visiting Succubi Brothels, then they review the Brothels and post their thoughts at local Inns and Taverns; hence the name Interspecies Reviewers! One day, they come across the rarest species of all, an Angel by the name of Crim. They befriend Crim and show him(her?) the world of Succubi Brothels.<br />
<br />
I think this show&#039;s strongest aspect is its sheer originality and creativity. The girls range from ultra busty cow girls, to on fire salamander girls, to undead cuties, and everything in between. Many of these species are known to anime fans as &quot;Monster Girls&quot;. These have grown in popularity in recent years thanks to many manga, anime, and eroge games. But this series takes it to a whole other level with how unique each species can be. This was a vital aspect that the mangaka/writers HAD to get right if they wanted viewers to come back, and they absolutely nailed it. Every week was a total blast seeing what wild and crazy species the gang would jump into bed with next. Be it busty cuties, sexy and slimy hotties, or creepy but alluring babes, the girls were a feast for the eyes.<br />
<br />
Continuing with the sheer originality and creativity point, another part of the show was actually reviewing said species. While we got plenty of bed action like sucking, thrusting, licking, and everything in between; the hilarity came from the various visual gags the writers used to get the opinion of each character across. After each hot and heavy scene, we would be shown the gang writing and talking about their thoughts of brothel they were currently partaking in. Varying from subtle to in your face gags, the visuals used to describe their feelings of pleasure, or at times displeasure, were genius, hilarious, and wildly entertaining.<br />
<br />
Visually, this was of course, very appealing. The art style was soft and cute and sexy all in one. If I could compare it to something, I would say that &quot;soft&quot; feeling was similar to a show like Sora no Otoshimono (another ecchi masterpiece). The designs were unique, cute, sexy, and just plain hot. Of course for a show with this subject matter, this was an absolutely essential aspect to the overall success of the series. The animation, while nothing spectacular, was good in its own right. Great jiggle physics and often above average motion when things were getting hot and heavy.<br />
<br />
The story itself is simple, yet intriguing. Going from brothel to brothel reviewing their personal experiences is just downright entertaining. Again, thanks in part to its creativity for each species. This never tried to be anything more than it is, a show about sex, and it wore that as a badge of honor.<br />
<br />
While the soundtrack was not something I would call outstanding, the music was appropriate where necessary. Nice baby-making piano and jazzy pieces to help set the mood for each sexual situation. The real draw was the terrific performances by the actors, both male and female. Moans of pleasure, hilarious one liners, and overall very believable performances helped make this even sexier than it already was.<br />
<br />
The characters themselves were all lovable in their own way, each with their own fetishes and preferences that helped make things more diverse depending on what you&#039;re in to. It never got boring because of this. Stunk, our relatable human protagonist preferred them young, beautiful, and busty. While Zel, our Elf protagonist didn&#039;t really care about looks, but more about mana, but still enjoyed his fair share of cuties and large busts. Other side characters liked things such as collars and masochistic fetishes, others were worried about smells, while Crim, our third protagonist was more innocent and was forced into things with a sort of &quot;virgin&quot; perspective.<br />
<br />
On the subject of Crim, I think he&#039;s(she&#039;s?) a little divisive. Often in Anime/Manga, Angels are shown to be hermaphrodites. With both functional male and female parts. This is the same with Crim, who looks both girly and a bit boyish as well. I personally, wasn&#039;t a fan of Crim because I wasn&#039;t interested in watching a girlish/boyish child having intercourse. But in the end, Crim was a &quot;necessary evil&quot; as they are used a vehicle for the viewer to help understand the world of Interspecies Reviewers better. Because Crim was new to the world, Crim would often ask questions about customs, cultures, and so on.<br />
<br />
As someone who has seen his fair share of ecchi, I can confidently say Interspecies Reviewers has cemented itself as a masterpiece in the ecchi genre. I have not seen a series that has pushed more boundaries or has been more unique than this show. Entertaining, extremely sexy, unflinchingly confident, and downright hilarious, Interspecies Reviewers will always make me want to come back for more.<br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s go to Paradise!

    How is this not a hentai?<br />
<br />
O praise the all mighty studio Passione for granting us mortals this gods gift to the world. We all know anime is more tame compared to the manga, but this is the opposite, while here we see all the sexual acts, but in the manga they are not there, well at least the things that happened in episode 3.<br />
<br />
Story: It is quite simple. This show is about reviewing brothels. There are many different kinds of brothels, for every gender and every weird fetish one may have like Birds, Cows, Slimes, Hyenas, Genderbend, Elves, Humans and many other creatures. Our main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328044">
        heroes Stunk, Zel and Crim go to try every species and make reviews for the horny people to know are they how fuckable species and can you enjoy them<br />
<br />
Characters: Stunk is a human adventurer who is very rich so he can go try every species. He seems to be the only one who likes elves for some reason. Zel is an elf who is Stunks trusty sidekick, he for some reason is attracted to humans and mostly for this old lady who looks like a dried fruit. Crim is an angel and a futa. Finally a futa in an anime and not in hentai. Of course she/he has the biggest dick of the bunch.<br />
<br />
The opening sounds like a knock off of YMCA. The song is still pretty good and visuals very interesting.<br />
<br />
If you like hentai or ecchi and want to awake a new sexual fetish then watch this.

    The anime about reviewers is bad, really bad.<br />
What does it do wrong? a lot.<br />
The story of the anime is a poor excuse to spin the wheel of sex scenes that have to happen cause this anime needs them to exist.<br />
The sex scenes themselves are so unenjoyable i recommend reading a doujin, instead of suffering through this awful, R-15 experience of a show. Cause this show cant show genitalia, it&#039;s a horrible watch that is almost equal to condensing few seasons of To-Love ru, and getting a high potency blueball potion. Don&#039;t say drinking it won&#039;t you wanna vomit.<br />
The characters of the show are indeed, a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328837">
        boring bunch of archetypes made up by author to please as much fetishes, ending up pleasing none. Explaining every non-human character would be too long, but lets say none of them seem inspired at all, they are more like generic examples of monmusu etc.<br />
The protagonists are unbearable, and annoy the hell out of me - I feel like when they cant shut their stupid mouths, they spew out what in doujins is written on side of the action. When girls in doujins think something, it&#039;s usually shown in boxes, same here.<br />
<br />
The sex scenes feel like you are watching hentai with one of these annoying aquaintances who explains everything you see, its a torture.<br />
<br />
Now what about the reviews - While the show does what it promises, gives reviews, no one cares - Would you care what an elf thinks of a human woman? Well I don&#039;t, so in that regard show just felt boring to me, with a lot of characters talking about stuff I don&#039;t care about.<br />
<br />
Artstyle of the show is.. fine.. I can give it that, I only hated how sometimes anatomy of characters is very cartoony and not always sexy - Of course a bad show must have something awfully appaling in its first episode and for me It&#039;s the obvious and migrene inducing joke about age preferences. Please stop, just stop, what single maniac enjoys every dripping second of this show.<br />
<br />
Overall I cannot stand it. The rule of &quot;you dont like it so don&#039;t watch&quot; of course doesn&#039;t apply - I had high hopes for a show that could be fun, and had stuff that picked my interest. I was surprised there is a show with a trap angel, big tiddy cowgirls, and monmusu.<br />
<br />
Sadly the show fails so miserably to bring any of this to you without slapping you with bad jokes, cringy writing and mediocrity in every field it tries to step on.<br />
<br />
I dislike the show on 2 fronts, for what it IS, and for what it, sadly, disappointingly, ISN&#039;T, but could&#039;ve been. There is a lot of hentai that could be just adapted to a show, but no, Passione picked up a really pathetic ecchi that fuels the fire of trash shows that just tickle the peepees of viewers who call this &quot;culture&quot;. The show isn&#039;t cultured, it&#039;s fanservice in WORST rendition.

    So, I&#039;ve never really written a review before, so this is a first.  While only four episodes in, I must admit that this is a good show, and in my opinion one of the best this current season has to offer, especially insofar as comedies.<br />
<br />
The story, admittedly, is basically the premise, but that&#039;s fine, because that&#039;s the driving point.  It&#039;s simple, raunchy, funny, and fills a niche some hentai attempt and fail to, making it fairly appealing to from what I&#039;ve seen, a lot of people.  The story is likely the weakest part of it, but that&#039;s because what occurs serves primarily

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328575">
        to drive the humour.<br />
<br />
This humour is largely centred on character interactions and the premise, both of which are highly entertaining, with some very funny and likeable characters to fill the cast in.  Personally Crim is my favourite.  Now, the series banks on the different characters and they do bounce off of each other really well, which keeps everything feeling fairly light-hearted, aiding in the absorption of the uuuh, ecchier side of things that defines the series, which is fairly intense.<br />
<br />
This ecchi is probly among the most extreme I have ever seen in an actual anime, especially one that would be airing on television, with it going so far as showing uncensored genitalia in the opening in the uncensored version, which surprised me a LOT.  And frankly, for what it is, I like the art style, and I think they pull off the ecchier scenes well, and also have a largely dynamic range of character expressions, which adds a lot to the visual comedy.<br />
<br />
SOooooooo yeah, at least so far, it is definitely worth a watch, 100%.  Whether it goes downhill or not is to be seen, but honestly, it&#039;s my favourite new show this season, and I think that&#039;s for good reason.  All said, for true culture, watch the uncensored version (the poking fun at censorship within it is lovely and cracks me up every time), and the opening and ending are just way too catchy (I mean the opening is basically an anime village people mashup, which is amazing).

    The anime that broke Funimation and MAL itself...and it&#039;s borderline hentai anime...a GENTAI.<br />
<br />
Ishuzoku Reviewers to go straight into brass tax, is an anime where a group of &quot;reviewers&quot; consisting of a hume Stunk voiced by Junji Majima, Zel the elf voiced by Yuusuke Kobayashi and latter on Crimvael the angel voiced by Miyu Tomita to uhhh &quot;do it&quot; with other species and reviewing them to a bar and that&#039;s it. Ishuzoku Reviewers&#039; ummm &quot;scale&quot; of sexiness breaks the bar as to how it can even get by TV standards, it doesn&#039;t as it got cancelled on some Japanese TV stations because of it!. Yes for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333317">
        a borderline hentai, LA means a BORDERLINE HENTAI because it gets that raunchy.<br />
<br />
So how raunchy well...<br />
<br />
From doing it with mushroom babes, Salamanders, Birdmaidens, Cyclops and the list goes on and on and considering how broad Ishuzoku Reviewers gets with it, yeah expected alot of fetishes comes through with this anime one way or another, with LA actually liking the Salamander girl in Episode 4...*ahem* literally too hot for LA. But yes due to the scenario Ishuzoku Reviewers gets itself into and how uhh graphic Ishuzoku Reviewers&#039; gets with it&#039;s H scenes...YEAH take that like you will, unless your unfazed by it, then this might as well be the Holy Grail of off-brand anime hentai anime.<br />
<br />
If anything Ishuzoku Reviewers makes the main cast going to brothels and doing it with other species, yet it goes hand in hand with the brilliant world building that was emphasized to every episode where the main cast are &quot;doing it&quot; with certain succu-girls. Like take LA&#039;s favourite episode of the Salamander Girl where it makes sense the Salamander brothel to be a hot climate, second if the climate is VERY hot and salamanders themselves don&#039;t mind it, why not make it a pseudo-BBQ place where SHE &quot;cooks the food&quot; and the entertainment of the brothel, like it&#039;s weird but it just makes sense. Ishuzoku Reviewers from this alone isn&#039;t just about sex, Ishuzoku Reviewers does an amazing job that LA didn&#039;t even realize until now that it&#039;s world building was ON POINT. LA actually loved it even in Ishuzoku Reviewers&#039; weirdest episodes, because Ishuzoku Reviewers does go out there and for an anime that&#039;s by anything taking things that the TV stations and licensing companies can&#039;t handle, it&#039;s a refreshing and interesting experience LA had seen in which Ishuzoku Reviewers was thee ONLY anime from Winter 2020 to even to take it that far and to execute it ALL THE WAY which LA praise even for what people might see it as an extremely raunchy ecchi anime borderline hentai.  <br />
<br />
The animation done by Passione, well LA will say this, but try and find the uncensored vers. if your in it for the Holy Grail of gentai as it gives you the best experience in it, BUT LA mostly watched censored vers. (though LA kinda wanted to watch it mostly uncensored but cie la vie) anyways the censored vers. has ALOT of censors but we &quot;get it&quot; on what happens but still sterilizes the animation and mostly makes it censors bars throughout. Nonetheless the animation done by Passione for an ecchi anime, was taken up the bar especially with the risque scenes to some decent character designs from ALL characters what with the setting of Ishuzoku Reviewers.    <br />
<br />
The voice cast is pretty extensive with some of the veteran and rookie seiyuu&#039;s going into this from Hiromi Igarashi, Yoko Hikasa, M.A.O and Natsumi Takamori to Miyu Tomitaand Reina Aoyama. LA would be going all day with the extensive of a voice cast as this so LA will say that Miyu Tomita as Crim and Yuusuke Kobayashi as Zel were pretty good but overall the voice cast even to it&#039;s huge voice cast were ALL GOOD.<br />
<br />
Ishuzoku Reviewers is that rare species of anime that is borderline hentai and anime and it KNOWS what it&#039;s advantages of both sides (with some disadvantages from both but nonetheless) of it, from the ACTUAL world building of a succu-girls fantasy world and how the succu-girls factor into it and the hentai that leads to it, learning just a little bit of the core cast time to time and all the while we get QUALITY...in the uncensored vers. of it. Ishuzoku Reviewers by all intents and purposes does what it does without hesitation and it KNOWS hentai very well.<br />
<br />
Audience: Wait if Ishuzoku Reviewers knows hentai so well, doesn&#039;t that mean LA knows it too<br />
<br />
LA: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Ishuzoku Reviewers very good 9/10, if you like a good gentai Ishuzoku Reviewers. For the fucc, vote Succ.<br />
