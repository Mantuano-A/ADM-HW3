    Okay, let&#039;s get it out of the way: If your still watching at this point, you probably don&#039;t have a problem with ecchi, boobs, panty shots and ALMOST hentai. SO going on that basis, I&#039;m not going to cater to the type of person wo&#039;s gonna whine about the obnoxious Boob/panty shots.<br />
<br />
 This show is awesome. Seriously, it&#039;s the best ecchi show ever created (and believe me, I&#039;ve seen a few). And why? Because it doesn&#039;t take itself seriously. Some shows, like Highschool of the Dead, would be good if not for the fanservice, but Dxd works in the opposite way. It would suck without

          <span style="display: none;" id="review128531">
        the comedy, fanservice and stupidity. Let&#039;s break this down:<br />
<br />
STORY: For what it is, the plot of DXD new is actually fairly serious, without seeming dumb. . .much. The first arc is actually quite dark, and all in all I enjoyed the greater scale the second season had over the first. The best/worst point about the plot, depending on who you ask, is the fact that the writers always have a new plot device to the pull out of there ass to explain why something happened. Which is great if you can look past it, but some people can&#039;t. <br />
<br />
ART: Probably the worst aspect of the show, the art is pretty standard, and the show basically goes at the basic level you would expect for an anime in 2013. Probably because the animators were too busy drawing boobs.<br />
<br />
SOUND: The music for this show is legit good, although I would say that neither of the openings in this season lived up to the awesome one from the first. That said, all the main themes that play through out are pretty good, both light-hearted tunes for the comical half of the show, and epic orchestra&#039;s and simple wind sections for the more dark/serious portions. <br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: You either try and take them seriously, and hate them, or you don&#039;t, and love them. I think that Issei is great, because he&#039;s basically ME if I was in that situation, and all the new side characters are pretty great (Go IRENA!!!). And a couple of the original team get some fleshing out, namely Kiba and Akeno, so good times.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: All said and done, this is why I gave the show a ten: It&#039;s fun. Highschool DxD is the best show to just relax and watch, with a box of chocolate/kleenex, depending on which way your inclined. And as Ecchi shows go, it&#039;s definitely at the top end of the scale. Can&#039;t wait for season 3!!!

    With the onslaught of ecchi titles that have come out this past year or so, there haven’t been many of them that have the distinct charm or courage as some of the great ones. They are all devoid of any pleasure or wit in how fan-service can be portrayed as colorful and sometimes ascetically beautiful in its artistry and dialogue. However, with that said, there are occasionally great gems hidden in the genre that does provide great comedy and memorable characters. Enter High School DxD.<br />
<br />
The series started with the first season as, in my mind, as a decent comedy/fan-service show with plenty of entertainment to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review115581">
        behold. Unfortunately, to its set-backs, most of the characters didn’t get enough deep characterization except for Rias, Asia, and Issei. Now we have High School DxD New, with a new story, plenty of glorious fan-service that makes the previous series pale in comparison in this aspect, and plenty more character development that was lacking in the first season. It is because of these three examples that make this season the best one of the series so far.<br />
<br />
It’s one thing if there are plenty of fan-service to your show to rank up with the great ones, but how does the art design fair with the show? By far, this series has some of the best character designs I’ve ever seen in any ecchi anime. All of the girls are drawn exquisitely gorgeous and are very easy on the eyes. Typically in this type of genre, you have to talk about the breasts and whether if they are over-emphasized to the point where they don’t compliment the girls’ figures. While it may depend on what you feel is too much for your size, the breasts in this show compliment all of the girls’ bodies and don’t feel out-of-place at all given how they are beautifully drawn. It is also a huge plus for the studio’s part to show the breasts in full uncensored glory and no annoying white fog.<br />
<br />
Now with the actual fan-service itself, there are plenty of reasons to like certain fan-service scenes in any show, but if you want to make it fun and exciting for someone like me who wants good writing put into his fan-service show, you can’t always put one in every single minute. Contrary to popular belief, there can be an intelligent way of putting fan-service into your anime. The key is good pacing in-between each joke and good writing that is both quirky and funny that doesn’t feel old after each continuing episode. In DxD New’s case, they actually spread the fan-service far apart enough to where they all feel new and fresh every time you are shown one. From the first second of the show, you’re already put into a situation where you have Rias’s gorgeous naked body cuddling with Issei, and it’s done with very smart intentions thanks to Issei’s funny dialogue.<br />
<br />
Onto the actual characters themselves, they all are still lovable and charming as ever in this second installment. At first, Issei can seem a bit over-eccentric at times with his love of oppai, but it’s one of those things where you can’t help but love the guy for his pure passion for something that he loves. It does help that he is voiced by the always mystifying Yuki Kaji who seems to always pop up in the most random shows these days; I also consider him somewhat the king of perverted characters in this current age of anime at this point. The one and only Rias Gremory is back and isn’t afraid to rev up the funny nature of the show up a notch with her fantastic body, and it doesn’t help for us with poor hearts that the always sexy Yoko Hikasa voices her, which in mind is just perfect casting. However, the one character that has now shot up to new heights of greatness is Akeno who is given more development that she so desperately needed and good heavens were it an enjoyable experience seeing her hilarious seductive moments to Issei.<br />
<br />
Supporting cast is, unfortunately, hit and miss for this season. We’ve already had Asia’s development in the previous season so there’s not much to talk about in her role here but it is nice to see her jealous moments here and there, always a nice laugh. The ones that are a hit are Xenovia and Yuuto who are good for different reasons. Yuuto’s plot arc involving him and his role in the club is now fully developed in his plot arc in this season and it’s actually done with good effect in his own personal struggles with coming to terms of his past. Xenovia is good in a different way. Not that her development was bad by any means, but her dialogue involving Issei is some of the funniest of the season by far. Her wanting to have a baby with Issei has to be the most brilliant comedic scene in the entire series in how it comes out of nowhere and how it is written so funny. The rest of the good characters in the season are definitely Rias’s brother and father who I would love to shake their hand in showing us an embarrassed Rias.<br />
<br />
For the ones that were a miss are the ones who don’t leave much of an impression, unlike the ones I’ve mentioned above. There are times where characters, one in particular Irina Shidou, seem like they are going to have a more significant impact with the show’s story but they are hardly even there once the story progresses. It is a real shame because Irina seemed like she would be an excellent character see in funny situations with Issei. Koneko is another character that is hardly ever given anything to work for other than to show off her combat abilities and say disgusting remarks at Issei’s perverted behavior. With the side characters, they aren’t initially supposed to have a lot of material to heighten the plot and comedy, but the writers could’ve at least come up with more exciting things for them to do so we can care for them.<br />
<br />
Now with the characters out-of-the-way, how is the plot fare with the fan-service? While the plot in the first season wasn’t anything groundbreaking or unique, it was mostly driven through character interaction and with this new season it fares a little better in how they introduce interesting plot arcs. Luckily the melodramatic moments in the first season are hardly in this season, so it doesn’t seem so hokey and eye-rolling in how undramatic it was. Not to say there aren’t any serious moments, there are plenty of them, but they aren’t done in a way where I would roll my eyes in how out-of-place it is with the tone of the show.<br />
<br />
So with all that’s said and done, High School DxD New is a welcoming sequel to the lovable franchise that shows no limits to censorship and great oppai. Unprofessional as I make it be, there’s an underlying fact of life that we are all human and we love to look at pictures or videos that gives us pleasure and makes us happy to be alive. We all need to keep this in mind when judging shows such as High School DxD, whether you love it or hate it. If there is something we can all agree on, is giving us the existence of Rias-senpai; what more could you ask for?<br />
<br />
Grade: B+<br />

    Let&#039;s get out of the most obvious factors first. For those already familiar with the High School DxD franchise, you&#039;re probably already familiar with some of its elements like the ecchi fanservice, harem building ethnics, and clothes tearing off through battles. More than that though, High School DxD New surprisingly has a plot. Can you believe it? An ecchi series with a plot! Well, if it means anything, it also involves a young man named Hyoudo Issei as he makes his goal to create his own harem and become a harem king. <br />
<br />
As part of the continuing show from the original High School DxD that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113837">
        aired in 2012, High School School DxD New continues directly as a sequel series. It adapts material from the light novel (novel volumes 3 + 4) based off the same name written by Ichiei Ishibumi and illustrated by Miyama-Zero. The show returns with delicious fun and trouble for Issei and his friends as startling revelations are exposed and conflicts are established.<br />
<br />
For a breath of refreshment, Issei Hyoudo is the typical high school kid who has no girlfriend but instead fantasizes about women (usually ones with big breasts). Then, he has this date after being asked out by a cute girl one day. If you thought your date ended up being terrible with the girl of your dreams blowing you off, then think again. Issei&#039;s date gets himself killed and in the worst way possible. But luckily, fate strikes as he is bought back as a devil and servant but the beautiful Rias Gremory. Now, Issei is part of a greater destiny. <br />
<br />
Now with that out of the way, we can move on because Issei has learned quite a bit since he was killed from the first season during his first date. For instance, he has been perfecting his &#039;Dress Break&#039; skill to many degrees that tends to result in compromising moments against his female opponents. At the same time, Issei has also began to make new relationships whether friend of foe. There is a certain instinct in Issei throughout the series that makes him....desirable in a way for his female companions despite them seeing him as a pervert. For Issei though, he is still often despised as a pervert at school wherever he goes. It doesn&#039;t seem like the way other female students at school has changed his views on him since the first season either. To make factors worse, there are also rumors being spread between him and another fellow student – Yuuto Kiba. It&#039;s not the prettiest picture when rumors saturated with BL undertones are being spread around a co-ed school that was once a female only academy.<br />
<br />
But with that being said though, it is surprising that Yuuto Kiba gets quite the highlight especially in the first half of the season. Normally in harem series like this, you&#039;d expect the main guy to be the center of attention trying to hog all the girls. However for the first half of the anime, we get to see a different side of Kiba than his usual cherry self. This relates to an incident in the past as we get take a little trip down memory lane. From that path, Kiba&#039;s past is not only revealed but we also get to see many startling revelations. Along with that though, new characters also makes their appearances from the light novels. Plot-wise, the second half focuses more on the ongoing conflicts going throughout the world of High School DxD. These conflicts become more grim and grimmer as we encounter antagonists that puts nearly everyone&#039;s lives at danger. Even with Issei, Rias, and her servants on the good side, there&#039;s a sense of hopelessness and anger-like atmosphere present. That&#039;s definitely a lot worse than failing an exam during high school.<br />
<br />
As this is the sequel of the original High School DxD, most of the main and supporting characters return while newer ones makes their appearances in the show. Of the most prominent female characters returning is Rias Gremory, the most admired beauty at school. However at the same time, we also can&#039;t forget the other girls like Asia, Koneko, and Akeno. This is especially true as Akeno herself also gets a spotlight and revelations are revealed about her. The certain degree in which her character shifts between flirtatious and moody makes viewers questions a bit about her past similar to Yuuto Kiba. It&#039;s from this sequel that we learn more about them as well as the new characters. <br />
<br />
As more secrets are revealed, conflicts also emerges throughout the series. This time around, the Occult Research Club really has their hands full not just dealing with the typical assignments but also saving the world. It&#039;s about survival and various instances puts many characters&#039; lives at risk. The risk involves the new antagonists with seemingly incredible abilities. They&#039;re faster, smarter, and stronger. Even the new supporting characters seemingly gets on the bad side of Ria&#039;s Occult Club that rises some angry eyebrows. <br />
<br />
Judging the action of this show, High School DxD New maintains balance of fighting and comedy the same time. It&#039;s surprising though since shows like this should be parodied with fighting especially with Issei&#039;s forbidden &#039;Dress Break&#039; technique, a skill so lustful that any female getting a taste of it might not feel the same way again after its first experience. Maybe I&#039;m exaggerating here but the show presents it in a way that is laughable but also the same time serious with its atmosphere. The majority of the main female cast all possesses skills in the arts of fighting with various degrees ranging from conducting electricity, healing, or throwing hardcore knockouts with a simple knuckles&#039; fist. It&#039;s obviously by now that we realize the female characters of this show represents a sort of antithesis as to the typical feeble or frail girl. At the same time, Issei himself shows a bit of experience and determination whether it&#039;s in battle or conflicts. This is what earns him the respect and even admiration of his peers. <br />
<br />
The show has fan service. This is obvious for those who are familiar with the first season. It doesn&#039;t go tame in any way in this sequel though. Even the first few seconds might raise some eyebrows with our beautiful Rias Gremory and her servant. There are many instances throughout the show that presents fan service in various ways whether it&#039;s the cliche pool episode with swimsuits, naked aprons, or just...nude in general.  Fans can take this in different ways but Issei takes it as the experience of a youth. Most if not all the fan-service incidents in this show involves Issei and a female character in some sort of compromising position. These aren&#039;t always accidental either but rather intentional. What makes a bit frustrating though is how dense Issei is despite obvious hints given by the female characters being interested in him. To put it a bit simply, he&#039;s the type of guy where you need to have billboard written out to get the message through him. The various teases and delicious bodies of the girls are sometimes right in front of him, not more than 3 feet away. However, his response is generally typical and so predictable that it hurts. <br />
<br />
Visual wise, fan service is out in the open. The majority of the female characters are designed with attractive curves, crystal clear eyes, and voluptuous figures. There&#039;s many direct references to their figures throughout the show by Issei and other characters that makes it distracting to watch. But taken on a more serious perspective, there are some decent design for the fighting transformations especially for some of our antagonists. They give off a dangerous look and presents that sense of hopelessness when confronting the heroes of this show. The new supporting character also give them a more holy-like aura while one other new character might be mistaken for its gender. Yuuto of course returns as a bishonen while Issei is colored with generic flavors. It&#039;s nothing extraordinary at all but for a show like this, it&#039;s to be expected. Just take a look at their uniforms with the obvious suggestive factors and you&#039;ll get a good idea.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s uncommon these days to see a one core series getting two different OP/ED songs. This is featured for the first half and second half of High School DxD New. The OP songs has a similar premise giving the montage of the main and supporting characters with bits of foreshadowing. The OP song &quot;Sympathy&quot; by Larval Stage Planning has this eerie like tone to it while its second OP song &quot;Gekijouron&quot; by ZAQ expands a bit of its first half. If fans remember the original ED song from season 1 with the pole dancing and very suggestive poses, then the first ED song might be a bit of disappointment in terms of service. The second ED song  though brings back that delicious fan service factor fans might be hoping for. It&#039;s noticeable that both songs are performed by the voice actresses of the same characters in the show as well. (Yoko Hikasa, Shizuka Itou, Azumi Asakura, Ayana Taketatsu, Risa Taneda, Ayane Sakura). The OST is consistent enough but sometimes seems out of space. Well what do you expect though? The boobs are back.<br />
<br />
In essence, High School DxD New is what fans of the original series may want with the fan-service, action, and plot progression. Yes, I said plot progression. Even for an ecchi show like this, there&#039;s development with certain characters that progresses the plot in its way. This series is definitely not the best show out there but it has its moments. If I had to describe this show, it would be sexy but also equally annoying to watch at some cases. Emphasis on the sexy.

    Despite the echiness, this anime really has it something. The story and the beautiful soundtrack makes the anime more than a teenage boys fapping material. The story is unique with a spice of fan service. I really like the idea of demons and angels and the action really nicely put up together. There is always something that I&#039;m eager to find out of the plot and i cannot stop myself watching it all over again. <br />
Don&#039;t take the series as harem ecchi, take it as a well made science fiction series with intriguing plot, interesting characters and mysterious hidden story behind the world that is

    Alright people, heres to the second season of demons accompanied by  boobs boobs more boobs and some stuff that almost crosses lines into the hentai realm, but hey, isn&#039;t that what we&#039;re all here for at this point?<br />
<br />
Sure there are haters out there that are going to accuse anyone who enjoyed this show(or me for giving it a 10) of being an idiot who only cares about boobs, but that is not the case and I will explain why I think its a good show throughout the course of this review.<br />
<br />
Story: Issei is back trying to get all the women for his harem or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review118725">
        whatever, and while the show cant be entirely be carried by shots of boobs (god bless them for trying though) it has enough of a story to keep me interested. Basically like the last season theres a bunch of boobs with a story in the background threatening issei&#039;s future hopes of being surrounded by boobs, all ending in a semi anti-climactic battle where isseis only motivation is (you guessed it) boobs.<br />
<br />
This isnt bad though, because one thing that ive learned is that you cant have ridiculous amounts of fanservice and an award winning story so i wont hold it against them for sacrificing one for the other.<br />
<br />
Art: Once again, if the animation team could draw circles and make them bounce, they were golden. Seriously though the art is very nice (very nice--said in a creeper voice) and i think it looks pretty friggin sweet.<br />
<br />
Sound: You hear three things in this show: shit blowing up, a bouncing noise(i cant imagine what for), and the words &quot;ara ara&quot; as such, since those three things were done well enough, alls well in the sound department.<br />
<br />
The characters: Yes yes yes we&#039;ve seen the characters before: the perv, the bombshell, the loli, the man candy, the shy girl, and the lightning wielding sadist... okay well maybe not the last one so much. Frankly though, i dont care if ive seen these character types a bunch before because in this show they all are perfect for what theyre doing and I cant find flaws with any of this.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: lots, lots and lots of enjoyment. I just have alot of fun watching dxd and thats something that i cant say for many animes.<br />
<br />
Overall: I really have fun with this show, I know that theres a large fan base out there, and I think that thats what counts at the end of the day. If I didnt seem to say alot about the show in the review, its because I am writing this for those who have seen everything up to this point and need nothing more than this. Honestly though, those who have seen and enjoyed season one dont need me to tell them to watch this.<br />

    Oh Pie, Oh my and Oh No, so what&#039;s my verdict for this 2nd season of High school DxD? Not good, and here&#039;s why:<br />
<br />
Story: Fair 6.<br />
<br />
The genre was still the same genre, the plot was a bit new and a bit boring, the only thing that studio  TNK does was to add new characters for every climax that comes along. Then again the part where the harem becomes intense was nice to say the least and Rias getting serious with stupid Issei also adds spice to this anime&#039;s story plot, but it kinda annoys me that he&#039;s too hesitant to bang either one of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113927">
        them and let&#039;s not forget about Akeno and Xenovia whom has no reservations of being the guy&#039;s concubine. <br />
<br />
Art: Outstanding 10.<br />
<br />
Oh PIIIIIEEEEEE! So I&#039;m guilty of enjoying this anime&#039;s fanservice, in fact it wasn&#039;t a surprise that this is where studio TNK is banking. I also like the scene where Issei is with Rias and Asia.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: Good 7.<br />
<br />
 I like both the 1st opening theme and the 1st closing theme, but not much on the 2nd closing theme and the 2nd opening theme, in fact those 2 new themes came in too little too late.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Character: Mediocre 5.<br />
<br />
Well, the character where still the same, we still have stupid Issei who still wants to be the &quot;Harem King&quot;, Rias is still present and so as the rest of the &#039;Occult Club.&quot; however the introduction of new members aren&#039;t that of a surprise since there characteristics have been already featured from the manga, as for the vampire, Gasper Vladi I kinda find it disgusting that he has to be this cross dress, day walking, half vampire and half human thing, I would have been nice if he was presented as a she and become another competition for Issei&#039;s affection. As for the other support characters... I just don&#039;t have much to say about them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Very Good 8.<br />
<br />
I said it before that I enjoy the fanservice that comes with this anime and it is the fanservice where studio TNK is banking on, everything else was too annoying especially Issei who would do anything for sex and his dream of being a &quot;Harem King&quot;, that is if he ever bangs anyone in his club, school and in his household since all of the clubs girls are now living with him, which is fair to say that such scenario does add to this anime&#039;s enjoyment.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: Pathetic 1.<br />
<br />
If I were to view this in an objective manner, I would say that season 1 was a bit fine compare to this sequel, co&#039;z in this sequel the expected battle between the Welsh Dragon and the white dragon has ended in a draw when some new character from the Khaos Brigade came by to interrupt, and really Son Goku from &quot;Saiyuki&quot; have to be the interloper?????????Corny!!!!!!!!Also, the main character Issei is way too annoying and there isn&#039;t an episode where you don&#039;t hear him say OPPAI, OPPAI and more OPPAI, man, he should be banging Rias already, frankly, his annoying and horny character alone,really makes this sequel too pathetic.<br />
<br />
Adios amigos. <br />

    Highschool DxD New has been a very popular series among the fans of Ecchi/School-life this season, but does it really live up to the hype? What follows are my honest opinions on it. <br />
<br />
Let me begin by saying that I don&#039;t wish to be flamed for what I write, and if you take what I say that seriously, than you should think of a decent way to refute my reasoning. <br />
<br />
To begin: the story. The story was horribly executed, with any drama in it being written off for scenes where they could make the moral reasoning for the character be nothing more than: &quot;I want

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113851">
        to see Rias&#039;s tits&quot; The story had a bit more to it than what I originally expected, but it didn&#039;t do much better than the first season, and as such shouldn&#039;t be rated above it. Now, I will admit that the addition of a few new characters was interesting, but it didn&#039;t drive the plot quite enough. <br />
Now, considering this is ecchi, the plot is definitely more than what I&#039;d originally expect, but it&#039;s nothing special. A solid 3/10 <br />
<br />
Now onto the characters. Considering that I look for characters with depth, while many of you look for the outer image of them, I&#039;ll split it into two categories. <br />
<br />
Character Physicality: As always, Rias and Akeno&#039;s proportions are very exaggerated, and I cannot support those kind of appearances. However, the addition of new girls with average/realistic body-types was a plus. I enjoyed seeing the new types of girls that they produced, and the way they acted based on the tropes of the series. 6/10 <br />
<br />
Other Character Traits: The characters didn&#039;t really garner any more depth than they had in the first season, and the only real development was around Akeno. Not that quality in this regard. However, they did add a bit more depth to the characters they added, and as I mentioned Akeno, which leads the character development to not be awful, but still be sub-par. 3/10 <br />
<br />
Animation: The animation is very basic, and is mostly made up of bland backgrounds and talking heads. However, seeing that it&#039;s basic for current animation, I will not rate it too poorly. Also, considering that they did crisp up a bit of a faulty bits of animation from the first season, and it did mature a bit in regards to how polished it looked. 4/10<br />
<br />
Sound: The voice acting cast is not bad, but in no regards are they amazing. The music/soundtrack is fairly basic as well, but it&#039;s not bad. With the songs being made up of similar music to the first season, and the OST being set to only a few scenes each episode, there wasn&#039;t a lot to base this score off of. However, seeing as it wasn&#039;t terrible, the following score is fair. 6/10<br />
<br />
Overall (I added 1 point for enjoyment value): The story is better than a lot of other ecchi, but it pales in comparison to the first season, and other than a few better-characterized females joining the harem, the story didn&#039;t develop too much, and left far too much unanswered. By no regards is this show above-average. What they could have added based on the source material, they disregarded. They turned what could have been fights based on love and such (similar to the first season) into more intense duels, and yet they turned them into gimmicks to have Issei pray for Rias&#039;s tis. However, I couldn&#039;t really expect less from an Ecchi/Harem. 5/10

    With the coming of High School DxD New (Second Season), it once again delivers on a high note, giving fans what they desire the most (No not just Oppais).High School DxD New concocts a remedy of action / comedy / supernatural / School Life and good ol harem. To top it all off, the audience gets a overly gracious amounts of fan service. This anime clearly is catered to the male audience, but however it possibly wouldn&#039;t deter females from also watching it as well for various reasons. Reasons such as having consistent enjoyable episodes, which are usually never dull, a rather above average story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review128557">
        with several plot twists, and lovable cast of characters with different personalities; whom actually have some type of character progression &amp; back story.<br />
<br />
Just a warning to those who want to try out the High School DxD series, whether it be from the first or second season, there are truck loads of fan service / Ecchi (particularly Nudity) There are only a several of animes that actually can pull this off and be considered a pretty good anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 8.3 -<br />
<br />
The story isn&#039;t particularly a very complex one just by reading the synopsis, but this anime provides twists and turns on a consistent basis. Pacing is right on the mark, for example a huge fan service episode (Typical beach episode) then suddenly it continues, with actual plot progression. That deserves some credit where its due. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Animation: 8.5 - <br />
<br />
Overall animation is very well done, not over the top &amp; fancy, but never below average. There&#039;s a great usage of neutral colors, because essentially it is sort of a dark premise. A lot of warm pinks and reds colors if you know what I mean are present as well. The action scenes are fluid and amazing to watch.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 8.5 -<br />
<br />
The characters in High School DxD are all surprisingly and distinctively different from each other. I believe this is where  High School DxD New&#039;s strong suit lies, other than its over the top fan service. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow Factor: 8.5 -<br />
<br />
Every episode is always enjoyable to watch and is delivered on a yes, consistent basis, the way they manage everything is amazing. Without a doubt High School DxD New keeps the audience thoroughly amused and wanting to know what happens in the next episode. A great anime with an over abundance of enjoyable fan service, very comedic / humurous, yet can switch gears nearly on a dime, to a more serious mood. High School DxD New is definitely worth a watch, you shall not be disappointed!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Final Grade: 8.4 / 10 -&gt; 8 (Anime List)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
           + The balance between the plot &amp; ultimate fan service<br />
           + Overall Consistency<br />
           + Angels, Demons, Swords and Oppais<br />
<br />

    If you watched the first season of this series, then you already know what you&#039;re getting into: a very fanservice-heavy harem romantic comedy with good action, decent plot, and memorable characters. This second season doesn&#039;t deviate much from the formula - everything you loved before is back, and probably better than ever before.<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
The story here is even better and more complex than the first season&#039;s. The main characters are all back, and the first large story arc deals with Kiba&#039;s backstory and expands his character a great deal, while the second arc sheds more light into the whole demon-angel-fallen angel war. Both stories are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review114145">
        pretty well thought-out and give the characters good development, all the while introducing new interesting characters who deepen the plot. The only weakness to the story is that it is still a bit predictable, especially the fight scenes, which play out kind of like Dragon Ball Z (strong villain shows up, friends get beaten up, main character gets insane power-up, villain is defeated, stronger villain comes out).<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
The fight scenes are pretty well animated and it is easy to tell what is going on. The characters are very well-designed, and girls all have pretty unique... um... &quot;features,&quot; if you know what I mean. The fanservice is once again on the heavier side, and it is something that, in my opinion, sometimes gets in the way of the rest of the scene. For the most part, though, it is something that doesn&#039;t harm the show. But you should already know what you&#039;re getting into if you&#039;ve watched the first season.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
The openings and endings are all very well done, though only one or two of them are really memorable. The background music supplements all the scenes well and helps create or dissolve tension as necessary in the story, though none of them are stand-outs that I would want to listen to on my iPod over again.<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
The biggest improvement to this season is the characters. We learn a lot more about all of them - their feelings, their histories, their families, their motivations, their problems, etc. Because of this, the characters have become even more endearing than they had been after Season 1. If you liked the series because of the characters, then you definitely won&#039;t be disappointed here. This season will make you want to watch more of the characters and their interactions and see their stories unfold.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this series, despite a few mild problems here and there and a bit too much unnecessary fanservice on a few occasions. If you liked the first season, then there&#039;s no reason you won&#039;t like this one.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />

    (This has been adapted from my reddit thread)<br />
<br />
(This is a review for both Season One and Season Two)<br />
<br />
In anime, there are many types of shows, from dark fantasies focusing on action to romantic comedies with a splash of drama. One genre in particular, ecchi, is mainly aimed at providing more sexual themes/happenings than other genres. For many ecchi shows, their focus on &quot;fanservice&quot; tends to diminish the show greatly. However, with High School DxD, the fanservice is actually used in more ways than one.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
High School DxD stars Issei, a normal high school student who is famous for is extremely perverted sense of mind. After unfortunate

          <span style="display: none;" id="review160921">
        (fortunate?) events, Issei becomes a devil and subsequently a part of the Occult Research Club. The club consists of Rias Gremory, the President, Akeno, the Vice President, Kiba, the pretty boy, and Koneko, the small-but-tough girl.<br />
<br />
One of the things that I found most enjoyable about the show was the way in which it handled the fighting, or more specifically the class system. Essentially, each club member is a chess piece; Rias is the King, Akeno the Queen, Kiba the Knight, Koneko the Rook, and Issei the Pawn. It seems simple when writing it out, but the writers do a nice job of incorporating the games pieces into the actual lore of devils and the ways in which they fight. This is especially true in the second arc of the first season where even chess tactics are used to overcome the enemy.<br />
<br />
Besides the use of chess, I found the world-building itself to actually be pretty good. Nothing is overly-complicated or even completely original, but I liked the dynamic between the angels, fallen-angels, and devils throughout both seasons. They introduce different aspects, such as historical events and nice descriptions of what each side is fighting for or against.<br />
<br />
Season one focused on introducing the characters, background lore, and Rias&#039;s relationship, whereas season two focused even more on characters, new story arcs, and giving our protagonist his &quot;final boss&quot;. I think I found the stories for both seasons to be equally as good. I enjoyed season one since it focused a lot more on Rias. Season two was good as well because it not only increased the overall world in which the characters were taking part, but also because more of the characters were explored and introduced, ultimately leading to more shenanigans between the girls and Issei.<br />
<br />
Also of note is how the fanservice within the show is actually used as a combat device. Issei&#039;s love for boobs and women in general (especially boobs) is used as a weapon not only against his opponents but as a way to increase the strength within him. Meaning, the fanservice really wasn&#039;t just for show; the plot was both plot and plot.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, the animation is actually pretty good. Many of the fight scenes are choreographed well enough, with fluid character movements and cool tricks used by all sides. I was actually somewhat taken aback during many of the fight scenes for how nicely they looked. Granted, the actual art style is not on the same level as something like Fate/Zero, but regardless the animation is still good.<br />
<br />
Being ecchi, the show also puts in considerable effort to make the women of the show look beautiful, sexy, and many times even lewd as much as they can. Now, going into the show knowing this, I expected there to be some fanservice. However, the version I watched had no qualms with showing the women completely naked (minus their vaginas). Meanings, and if I am not mistaken, there was always at least one naked breast shot per episode. And again, the animation and even the art here is nicely done, with appropriate physics and appeal to match.<br />
<br />
This is true for both seasons; the animation quality and amount of boobs never wavers.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
I think the characters within DxD tend to be a little tropey (loli-girl, sadist girl, super nice girl, tomboy girl, etc.) but I actually thought the show did a nice job of trying to provide good backgrounds for all of the characters. Now, some of them have yet to be fully explored, but I am sure with the coming season (and others?) they will to.<br />
<br />
Season one took its time with Rias and Asia. Season two decided to go with Kiba, Xenovia, and Gasper (and slightly with Akeno). Also, the final boss character I also really like. He isn&#039;t just evil for the sake of being evil, but rather has his own goals and ambitions or things that he wants to accomplish. And as you learn, he is literally Issei&#039;s rival. In that regard, I think season two does a nicer job with the characterization, even if they didn&#039;t focus as much on Rias as I would have liked.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
The OPs for both season one and two were not that good. However, season one&#039;s ED, which can be listened to here, and season two&#039;s ED, which can be listened to here, were both not only catchy but extremely pleasing to the eye. That is to say, visually the EDs are probably the most sexually suggestive things I have seen in anime (obviously not counting the show itself).<br />
<br />
I thought the voice acting was appropriate for their roles, but nothing in particular stood out to me performance-wise. I recognized some of the voices from some of the characters, but that is besides the point.<br />
<br />
I should note however the sound effects, specifically the one associated with each woman&#039;s pair of breasts. For the more endowed woman, there would occasionally be this &quot;squish&quot; noise associated with their boobs moving/colliding with one another. This isn&#039;t anything spectacular, but when I first started noticing it, I thought that it was quite interesting that the studio put that much detail towards the boobs. I think at this point, it should have been expected!<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
While the story is nice and the animation is good, in order to fully enjoy the show you have to like boobs. I&#039;m not kidding, there are a lot of naked women that show up over the course of the show. From the OP to the ED and everything in-between, the show will not hesitate to show you boobs. And for me that was perfectly fine. Being a young man myself, I like naked women, so the show was definitely pleasing to watch.<br />
<br />
But like I said, it is more than just naked women. There is actual world-building and character development that takes place. I would say that the show does a nice job of balancing the two sides.<br />
<br />
I wouldn&#039;t go so far as to say that the show is porn (there is no actual sexual activity, even if it is alluded to), but I haven&#039;t seen a show that was willing to go as far as it did with its women. I really don&#039;t mind fanservice, but if you do, then this show is definitely not the one for you.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY, SEASON 1<br />
<br />
Story: Fine, interesting lore and clever use of class mechanics<br />
<br />
Animation: Good, good looking women and nice fighting scenes<br />
<br />
Characters: Fine, nothing groundbreaking but characters are explored<br />
<br />
Sound: Bad, only the ED is worth listening to and even then you are probably only watching for the visuals<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Great, funny, nice lore, and plenty of boobs<br />
<br />
Final Score: 6/10<br />
<br />
SUMMARY, SEASON 2<br />
<br />
Story: Fine, ups the ante while providing us with more lore to work with<br />
<br />
Animation: Good, quality persists from season one but with even more girls to look at<br />
<br />
Characters: Good, more characters are introduced while previous ones are developed<br />
<br />
Sound: Bad, again just the ED (but still for the visuals)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Great, the story, characters, and boobs are in full-force once again<br />
<br />
Final Score: 6/10

    If you are reading this review, then most likely you have seen the first season and gotten used to the high amount of panty shots/boobs. That being said, I&#039;m going to jump right into the review of this boob-filled wonderland that we call High School DxD. <br />
<br />
Story 9/10<br />
Most harem anime have little to no story, however, High School DxD is the exception to that rule. The story that it has is a genuinely good one. In this season there is a lot of focus on characters other than Issei. A few of the episodes go into Kiba&#039;s past and how he was reborn as a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review134859">
        devil, and also some very intriguing things about Akeno. It also introduces two new characters, Irina and Xenovia. This season introduces quite a few new characters that will play a part in future conflicts. However, there is still enough of Issei to go around. Whether it be him dealing with chicks, or fighting with his Sacred Gear. <br />
<br />
Art 8/10<br />
The art in season 2 is definitely superior to the first season, they pay a lot more attention to details. However, they still do put a lot of emphasis on boobs/panties, but that is to be expected. Overall I found the art to be very well done and detailed.<br />
<br />
Sound 9/10<br />
The music for this season was awesome. And the voice acting was beautiful, what stuck out to me the most was Akeno&#039;s voice. They could not have picked a better person to voice her, it was cute and yet seductive at the same time. The other voice actors did a good job as well, such as Issei when he is raging or in full perv-mode. The emotion in the actors voices were very real and refreshing.<br />
<br />
Character 9/10<br />
They went quite in-depth for the characters surrounding Issei. They gave quite a bit of information regarding Kiba, Akeno, Irina, and Xenovia, as well as other supporting characters. It made those characters that much more likable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
I thoroughly enjoyed High School DxD New and can&#039;t wait for another season! There isn&#039;t much to not like in this show, it gives you the action of Issei kickin&#039; ass, and all the Ecchi you could ask for. <br />
<br />
Overall 10/10<br />
This is definitely one of my all-time favorite anime. It has the Ecchi/harem I was looking for, and tops it all off with a powerful yet comical main character. Plus, their storyline isn&#039;t full of cliche&#039;s like most Ecchi/Harem type anime, which gave it a unique and more enjoyable feel to it.

    *will edit when issei reaches 3rd base<br />
The wait for season 3 felt like the ending of school days, empty, like a womb<br />
Let starts this review with a quick back story, i had to replenish a years worth of lotion and tissue to accommodate 4 episodes worth of this blasphemy of an anime<br />
Secondly, i had to install 5 A-grade locks, set up 6 security cameras around my rooms perimeter, an emergency kill switch and hire an ASSASSIN to watch this anime safely, you&#039;ve been warned<br />
With that being said, i expected nothing less from the 3rd season of Highschool DxD<br />
What we came to love about season 1

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214121">
        boobs season 2 boobs has all been brought to the next level<br />
<br />
Character: How can a Male Lead that is a manifestation of every single living male being on the face of this world be anything but god-like <br />
Issei Hyoudou is the quintessential character that makes this anime different from the rest. His pursuit of happiness can only be admired by the viewer and anyone who thinks its gross should get a life.<br />
That being said, every other character in this anime seems to play a pivotal role in making Issei look even more fking amazing.<br />
<br />
Music: After listening to the amazing opening, ending, and in-anime music i can&#039;t help but question my existence and why i wasn&#039;t born in a parellel universe where life is depicted like anime, i had to punch a newborn child to come back to reality<br />
<br />
Story: The development of the story in this season so far is amazing and can only be described by 1 word, bust-a-nut-worthy<br />
<br />
Plot: Talking about the the PLOT would require more than 69 kazilionbillion words, lets leave it at nice, also, this season has many new introductions of mythology which really was surprising and adds another dimension to the storyline<br />
My will was tested and i lost, tears flowed down my cheeks, this season so far has everything, heart break, love, action and friendship.<br />
<br />
Art: The art causes a symptom known as tight pants-eritus, every shot, every scene, and every camera angle brings a new level of beauty and brings enjoyment level over 9000, the detail around the jugs of the girls are a step in the right direction and shows us how far we have gone in boob making technology as a species<br />
<br />
Overall: I thoroughly enjoyed it and I could never look at women in the same way, my expectations have skyrocketed<br />
<br />
My review of probably one of the best harem, ecchi animes in recent and probably future history is completed. Highschool DxD is simple, it does not try to be the next Stiens Gate or Full Metal Alchemist, but plays to its strengths. This 3rd installment of the series is a MUST watch because of the reasons stated above, such as the Art and Music. We may take our body pillows on dates but our desire to find our Garden of EDEN will not be stopped, Highschool DxD is our gateway.<br />
That is why i believe Highschool DxD BoRN is Infinity/10!<br />
<br />
Whole Season : Even with a 10/10 score this season didn&#039;t feel the same compared the season 1 and 2, i can&#039;t pinpoint exactly why but it felt like something was missing and maybe this was because it deviated from the Light Novel. With that being said, even with a somewhat of a downhill ending, season 3 still managed to clear my stockpile in a matter of seconds

     An English professor who once taught me argued that you could tell a lot about a work of fiction, whether a novel, movie, play or a TV show, by examining its first line. This is clearly true when examining the second season of Highschool Dxd, also called Highschool Dxd New. The season’s first line is “boobs”, a line which pretty much sums up the entire show. Now don’t get me wrong, Highschool Dxd is, at its core, an Ecchi about boobs and other naked female body parts. However, like its predecessor, it still manages to provide a somewhat interesting and coherent story with decent

          <span style="display: none;" id="review155555">
        characters whose overtly sexual natures can be overlooked due to the shows genre and purpose. <br />
The story picks up shortly after the end of the first season with not much having changed. Primarily, this season focuses on the conflicts and interactions between the devils, angels and the fallen angels. Surprisingly, the devils continue to be the “good guys” in this conflict with the sinister fallen angels being the source of most of the stories evil. This time around the plot is more compelling than in the first season, and comedic undertones continue to reappear. Honestly though, whether you’re watching Issei employ his sacred “pervert power” or the absurd sexual logic of the main characters, this show is hilarious. With all this being said, the story, when compared to other anime, is somewhat weak, and one must recognize that Highschool Dxd New is a show that values nudity, fan service and ridiculous sexual situations more so than a compelling story.<br />
The characters are definitely more captivating this time around. In the first season, some characters such as Kiba and Akeno felt completely undeveloped and simply seemed to hang around in the background. Now, these secondary characters are portrayed in a new light, and actually have personalities detailed enough that one could actually discuss these characters in more depth than just by comparing their bodies. There are also some new characters added to the mix, such as Xenovia and Irina, two members of church, as well as other devils and fallen angels. These new characters result in some interesting subplots and even more comedic situations. This second season also acts as more of a traditional harem than the first, as an larger amount of the female cast becomes interested in Issei, unlike in the first season where it seemed that Issei had only two love interests. So, I suppose if you’re into harems that’s a plus for you. At the same time though, it becomes annoying for every character to randomly fall in love with the main character for little to no reason what so ever. Furthermore, it becomes downright silly when various unbelievably sexy girls come onto the main character, basically crawling on him naked, and he is unable to act for whatever stupid reason. This is just so unrealistic that it becomes bothersome. However, this is the kind of stuff that will occur in shows like this, so it is somewhat forgivable. In the end, in comparison to other movies and anime, the characters are quite lackluster, but in the realm of ecchi, there pretty good. There is a large variety of girls, all attractive for their own reasons, as to appeal to different tastes. One would be hard pressed to not find at least one suitable wiafu when watching this show.<br />
The art is great, and damn do the animators do a good job at making animated teenage girls so hot. The physics are also excellently done, resulting in fluid and believable bouncing of breasts with characters every movement. Aside from the characters, this is a fairly new anime with some great art, and overall everything is crisply animated.<br />
The soundtrack is similar in quality to the first two seasons, and the opening and closing credits are quite catchy. I watched the Japanese sub for season 2, unlike for the first season where I watched the dub. The Japanese dub is good (but not great) and is a significant step up in quality as opposed to the English dub.<br />
Obviously, if you’re not a fan of the whole ecchi genre this is not a show for you. However, if you enjoyed the first season of Highschool Dxd, your likely going to enjoy the second season just as much, if not even more.

    Here&#039;s my review of High School DxD New.<br />
<br />
The story of High School DxD New follows the events of the first season when Rias moves in with Issei and his family. The plot centers around volumes 3 and 4 of the light novels. The first half show gives you a glimpse into Kiba&#039;s past and how he has the last survivor of The Holy Sword Project and how the leader of the project reemerges and wants to use the four holy swords to start a war. The second half of the show is about a truce between the angels, devils, and fallen angels. In addition, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review166721">
        clash between Issei, possessor of the Welsh Dragon Ddraig and Vali, possessor of the Vanishing Dragon Albion.<br />
<br />
Some of the characters are more fleshed out in this show for example Akeno. She starts having lustful desires for Issei and starts to fall in love with him. She is also revealed to be a reincarnated devil who was once half human and half fallen angel. Rias has more of a jealous personality when the other girls try to flirt with Issei. Also we get introduced to some new characters, but the three I am going to talk about are Gasper, Irina, and Xenovia. Gasper is a first year student at Kuoh Academy and is a cross dressing vampire who is timid and afraid of people, but gets development as the show goes on. Irina is a childhood friend of Issei and is a reincarnated angel. Finally, there&#039;s Xenovia a reincarnated angel who later joins Rias&#039;s peerage as her knight and wants to bear Issei&#039;s children.<br />
<br />
The show isn&#039;t that much different from the first season. I still find it very entertaining. There are some pretty funny moments in this show. Overall I think the show is great and say that if you want to watch a show that you could just sit down and watch just for the hell of it I recommend this show and it&#039;s predecessor.

    Story: 9/10<br />
<br />
Way better than 1st season, the kiba past is very sad emotional given him more of a character grow that rare in this type of anime. Rias jellousy &amp; akeno seduction of issei is fun to watch. The second arc which introduce the leader of the faction the summit of the 3 power have a lot of surprises &amp; twist that keep you guessing what gonna happen next. The villians issei and the gang face this time is a step up from last season, kokabiel &amp; vali is very  powerfull foes to overcome &amp; that last episode fight is epic. There a lot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review114951">
        of ecchi fanservice as expected from dxd.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
<br />
To me high school dxd art is beutifully drawn &amp; a lot of colours use especially on the dragon armors.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
<br />
Wow! super impresive, oscestral to rock music is use perfectly on the scenes it made me very sad &amp; sometime very pump up.<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
<br />
Azazel is hands down the best character this season of high school dxd, hes so lay back, fun, badass  &amp; very interesting to watch. Xenovia come close her actics with condom &amp; strait face is hilarious. Irina &amp; gasper is ok characters but nothing beats azazel &amp; xenovia. Funny a lot of anime like to make angels to be a badguy its a refresing to see the head angel micheal is nice &amp; all the 3 faction work together &amp; resolve problems.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
<br />
I really enjoy this season more than last &amp; last season is great!<br />
<br />
Overall 9/10: <br />
<br />
Dxd has its problems &amp; not for everyone but if you enjoy great humor, ecchi fanservices &amp; over the top action your going to love high school dxd new.<br />

    *WARNING! THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS FOR SEASON 2 OF HIGH SCHOOL DxD* <br />
<br />
What do you think of while watching the Ecchi genre? For me, at least, I think about how corny the story line is and how boring the characters are. I&#039;ll admit it, Ecchi shows don&#039;t interest me. Then came High School DxD, a show with a lot going for it, but the execution wasn&#039;t exactly the best. How do you fix something like that? Add another season of course!<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10 - The story for the second season doesn&#039;t completely overhaul the foundation the first season laid out, but rather expands upon

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178191">
        it, which is a good thing in my opinion. It can get a bit silly at times, and often times the show does not know when to take itself seriously or not, but overall High School DxD has proved that even borderline porn can have a plot. While I would like to go over the general storyline some more, it has multiple arcs to it so going over everything that season 2 has to offer will take a lot more time than needed.<br />
<br />
Animation: 10/10 - Wow... There is not a word I can say to describe how breathtaking the art is. When they are not flashing giant boobs in your face, they are displaying some of the most intense fight scenes that anime has to offer. I like to consider the fight scenes as &quot;Beautiful Destruction&quot;, the world MAY be exploding... but it looks so damn awesome that you can&#039;t help to be amazed at the chaos. This is something High School DxD does best, it goes ALL OUT with the fight scenes, and it is truly a marvel to behold. <br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10 - While the dub to this show (in my full opinion) is one of the strong points, the soundtrack could of been a lot more intense. To be honest, both of the intros to this show weren&#039;t exactly memorable, and the background music often leaves a lot to be desired.   <br />
<br />
Character: 9/10 - Wait, what?! An Ecchi show where the characters have personality? What is this? That&#039;s right. Something Season 2 did great on was expand upon Akeno and Kiba. Akeno became a lot more than just Rias&#039; sidekick, and a lot of backstory was revealed about Akeno to prove that she isn&#039;t just a pretty sight. And as for our &quot;Prince Charming&quot;, Kiba? He probably got the most character development this season than anyone else in the show. The thing that really made Kiba&#039;s back story depressing wasn&#039;t the fact the he abandoned his faith, but rather how his faith abandoned him. Also, there were a few characters that are new to this season. Let&#039;s start with Xenovia: Being a strong believer in the church, she set out with her best friend on obtaining the stolen pieces of Excalibur from a fallen angel, but in the process, she learned the ugly truth: God is dead. The church realized she has learned this and ex-communicated her, and with no where to run, she joined up with Rias and became a devil. One other character I would like to go over is the adorable vampire: Gasper. Gasper was born half-vampire and half-human, and as a consequence, he was stuck between both worlds. He wasn&#039;t strong enough to have the vampires respect him, however, he was also viewed as a &quot;monster&quot; by many of the humans. So our ol&#039; friend Rias decides to take Gasper in to become her Bishop. The problem, however, is that Rias wasn&#039;t able to contain Gasper&#039;s powers and he was locked away, but now our shy little vampire makes his debut when his powers are truly needed. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10 - There is not much I can say to describe how much I enjoyed watching this show. When I wasn&#039;t laughing, I was engulfed by the insane amount of awesome fight scenes, or focused on Kiba&#039;s quest for revenge. Finding a boring point to this show is probably the second hardest thing the show will give you. If you catch my drift. <br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10 - Was it a bit cheesy? Yeah. But, with a passable storyline, INSANE animation, great dub, likable characters (who are more than just eye candy), and an intense amount of enjoyment,  High School DxD truly deserves it&#039;s title as the &quot;King of Ecchi.&quot;

    Before we start, this review is on the SHOW. As good as the oppai might be, it wouldn&#039;t be a proper review if we focused on dem tittays. Therefore we shall be talking about the plot, and not the &quot;plot&quot;<br />
<br />
High school DxD is what all ecchi should be. When a friend mentioned to anime to me I thought it was going to be a boobfest with little to no plot at all. I was wrong. I mean , the boobfest was still there but it was accompanied with a plot. A good plot. <br />
<br />
STORY: now I won&#039;t be spoiling any of the plot here, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review169359">
        trust me when I say that it&#039;s a solid story. Not the best but a story that goes deeper than you would think for a ecchi comedy. Not too deep though. Deep enough to enjoy but not deep enough for you to wake up at 2 am and scream &quot;I UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING NOW&quot;.<br />
<br />
ART: I mean, it&#039;s standard. Average. Yep.<br />
<br />
SOUND: Sound is actually not to bad. Not the best openings and closings I&#039;ve seen. but I mean hey, it&#039;s pretty good. Dark parts of the anime have dark music and light parts have light music. Funny parts having funny music. Music does its job well.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER. I didn&#039;t hate a single one. Not even the villains. Okay maybe one or two villains but the characters are very enjoyable. Likable and realistic. To a degree. Because ya know. It&#039;s an ecchi.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT. Absolutely enjoyed this. This is one of those animes that really is solid once you get over the boobfest. <br />
<br />
OVERALL: story is great, art is average, sound does its job, characters are likable and solid. Really enjoyed it. It&#039;s a fun little anime that is worth a watch. <br />

    Despite the echiness, this anime really has it something. The story and the beautiful soundtrack makes the anime more than a teenage boys fapping material. The story is unique with a spice of fan service. I really like the idea of demons and angels and the action really nicely put up together. There is always something that I&#039;m eager to find out of the plot and i cannot stop myself watching it all over again.<br />
Don&#039;t take the series as harem ecchi, take it as a well made science fiction series with intriguing plot, interesting characters and mysterious hidden story behind the world that is still
