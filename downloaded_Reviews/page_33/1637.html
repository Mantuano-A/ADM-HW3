    Have you ever had one of those moments where after you finished watching an anime series, you got a feeling of “damn, I wish I had finished this sooner?” Or maybe, after you finished watching it, you thought, “this NEEDS a season 2”. Well, I&#039;m sure most people who have one of those moments sometimes in their lives after finishing watching a certain series. It can be something based out of enjoyment, something fresh or unique that you never originally thought you&#039;d encounter, or maybe just something that was just hell out of a right whether subjectively or objectively. Regardless though, this series known as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review89831">
        Problem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren&#039;t They sure hit one of those marks because I got one of those moments.<br />
<br />
Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? (also just known as Mondaji for short) is an anime series adapted from the light novel of the same name. The series takes place in a fantasy world featuring four prominent characters. I have not read the LN version of this anime so I came into this with a fresh start. But from what I got was more than just a fresh start but rather a pleasurable experience. <br />
<br />
To reiterate things, the majority of the series takes place in a fantasy world. More specifically though, it focuses on the “No Name” community, a place where there is trouble loose. It&#039;s up to our protagonists to help save their world after being invited by a flamboyant rabbit. Sounds strange right? This is obviously supported by the fact that the protagonists themselves are troublemakers. Take for example, Sakamaki Izayoi. He is portrayed as the badass and arrogant young boy. He does what he wants, when he wants, and how he wants. In general, he is a &#039;problem child&#039;. His love for violence can be seen earlier on even from the pilot episode when he gets involved with some other kids. Yet behind that outer ulterior, we can see that Izayoi is a boy of intellect through his strategic thinking and ways of dealing with problems himself. At even one point, one of the main characters admits that “you really are smart” directly. Despite his arrogance though, Izayoi does seem to care about his comrades and dangerous events as he puts himself at risk. The way he expresses it though...not so much being the &#039;nice guy&#039;.<br />
<br />
That of course only makes up one third of the trouble making trio.<br />
<br />
Among the group are also two young girls named Kudo Asuka and Kasukabe Yo. They seem to exist in opposite of personalities as Asuka seems to be play the role of a girl who has a more open personality while Kasukabe Yo maintains a more quiet posture. This is even evident through Asuka&#039;s ability where she is able to command others through speech. And of course, they join in the fun after the faithful day when they are asked to help with problems in the &#039;No Name&#039; community. In fact, all three of these characters seems to be bored of their normal day lives and seek a bit of joy. There&#039;s no better place to do that in the &#039;No Name&#039; community.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which now, I almost forgot to introduce that certain bunny-eared girl. With fluffy ears, a shy personality, but a heart of determination, she invites the trouble makers to stop the trouble. So without further ado....let&#039;s introduce that Bunny Girl...Kurosagi! Literally translated as “Black Rabbit”, she is the girl who sets the plot and gives the problem children a little joy to their boring lives. Although portrayed as being 200+ years old (is this even true??), she has the personality of a normal girl and that is being easily embarrassed at certain situations and sometimes insecure about the events going around her. However, there is one thing that is for sure. She wants to overthrow the Demon Lords from her world who have been causing nothing more than trouble. <br />
<br />
The series adapts many supernatural and fantasy themes through its setting. In fact, the world that the problem children ventures into is nothing like the world they once knew. There are mystical creatures like dragons, jack-o-lanterns, vampires, and everything we don&#039;t see in our modern day world. Despite the dangers some of the creatures pose, the problem children deals with them like another day in the park. In fact, I can safely say that their abilities are far too overpowered with some of them literally getting back up after being battered, shattered, and broken. Izayoi&#039;s “Code: Unknown” along with his psychic powers makes him one of the strongest characters in the series. Because of his confidence and strength being nearly unrivaled, no wonder he is often so bored with his life. Asuka&#039;s power to control others through words is also seen as a very dangerous and useful ability that extents to animals, humans, and even other gifts. Last, we have the shy girl Kasukabe who rules over the animal kingdom with her skill to communicate and gain their abilities. If you put the three together, it seems to almost like a dream team. However, this is not always the case as the group seems to have problems and ideologies between themselves.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, there are many adversaries in the series ranging from vampire lords to aristocratic individuals who claims themselves as Gods. They set the premise of this series as being the ones causing the trouble and it&#039;s up to the problem children to stop them. Yet, there are many instances in which the show takes the wrong turn and make their encounter seem too eccentric. However at other cases, I find the politics and rivalries to be entertaining; more often times with Izayoi because of his personality and speeches.<br />
<br />
While the series seems original, it does have a few issues. Personally, I found some of the jokes to be a bit too repetitive. This is especially true to our beloved little bunny-eared girl where she becomes the center of attention to lewd jokes. Although amusing to watch at occasions, it becomes old and repetitive. Additionally, the theme of traveling to another world to fight in competitions is not new. Series like Dog Days and Ixion Saga DT have taken such themes before and also performed similar stances. It&#039;s been done. The series&#039; pilot episode also seems to be quite rushed with a lot of information thrown in at once rather than expanding them further. I guess this can be related to the issue with the length of the series. It&#039;s only 10 episodes so pushing it throughout each episode might of just been too much. Regardless these flaws though, it still makes its exciting point across.<br />
<br />
In terms of visuals, the series sets itself with the fantasy themes. The Little Garden, the way Kurosaki is dressed, and the mystical creatures are all proof of this. Additionally, the various games themselves revolves around events that are magical. However, I do admit that the characters&#039; designs are a bit too generic. For example, Kurosaki fits into the role of the typical bunny girl with her outfit. The rest of the world where most of the events take place have that fantasy feeling.<br />
<br />
Regarding the soundtrack, the series makes excellent use of its scores. The soundtrack works well in general and often or not, it&#039;s fun to hear it balance out between exciting moments (the game competitions) and some of the more lighthearted times. The OP song, &quot;Black † White&quot; by Iori Nomizu, is very catchy with the way it presents itself with words like “bam!”, “1, 2, 3”, “black, white”, and other fun words being used. The ED song  “To Be Continued?&quot; by Kaori Sadohara gives the main characters a super flat deformed version of themselves and presents into in a fun way. (I&#039;m looking at you Izayoi). It&#039;s pure fun to watch it to be honest. Do not skip that ED song.<br />
<br />
Overall, this series is the golden egg for me in 2013 so far. Well, at least it&#039;s amusing and strange enough with its small cast of badass characters. Oh sure there is some fan service and dirty jokes here and there, but it overall maintains its themes well with the initial premise. In fact, most of the episodes sets with its intense atmosphere related to the games with the main characters each getting his or her own spotlights. And oh, how can we forget that badass Izayoi? The guy has both brains and the brawn that exists entirely opposite of the typical, wimpy, and indecisive male of a harem. So yes, this series was a surprise watch for me. It&#039;s only 10 episodes so why not give it a try?

    I felt compelled to write a review for this anime so as to balance out any other reviews which might entice people to give this one a go.<br />
<br />
My initial thoughts to this anime was that it was interesting, engaging and entertaining.  The initial premise of the series seemed interesting enough for me to continue watching it.  The animation itself is really well done for the most part, so I thought, hey, give it a go.<br />
<br />
And I&#039;d say the first episode is engaging and humorous enough to make you watch a second.  But after, that&#039;s where it dropped.<br />
<br />
Let me explain:<br />
<br />
The first thing is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review89997">
        the complete lack of explanation of the world in which the three gifted human protagonists find themselves in.  Although the three characters are likeable enough, I found myself very confused as to what the actual plot was about.  The bare bones I understood, but basically this was like a mmorpg set in Wonderland with a ditzy ecchi bunny as a tour guide.<br />
<br />
Essentially there are communities that have to fight, or play &quot;gift games&quot; (yeah, what the hell does that mean?) in order to win gifts for the community, so the community can prosper and move up in the &quot;world&quot;.<br />
<br />
Each &quot;gift game&quot; has certain rules - that usually don&#039;t make any sense to the watcher -  that the &quot;players&quot; have to abide by.  But essentially the &quot;rules&quot; mean squat, the protagonists just have to beat up their opponents.  At first I thought the &quot;gift games&quot; would be interesting where the &quot;players&quot; would have to use their wit or skill to traverse and win, but the &quot;rules&quot; or mostly nonsensical, nonexistent, or completely superfluous to the outcome anyway, making the crux of all conflict in the world difficult to swallow.<br />
<br />
The protagonists themselves have superhuman powers which the show doesn&#039;t explain at any point.<br />
<br />
And then there is the ecchi.  Okay, so maybe people like fanservice.  Hell, why would the animators do it otherwise?  But there is a level of, yeah okay I&#039;m willing to overlook that, and then there is a point where I say it becomes distracting and pointless.  The constant sexual innuendo of the bunny is tiresome, and I found I couldn&#039;t think of a way to sit through the rest of the series.<br />
<br />
And after 9 episodes I found the plot, or lack thereof, not deep enough, believable enough, or sustaining enough for me to want to continue.<br />
<br />
If you like a very light-hearted and simple anime with a decent amount of mostly harmless but constant fanservice, I&#039;d go for this one.  If you don&#039;t mind being confused about the story, or befuddled as to why the story is so lacking, then give it a try.<br />
<br />
The art is decent.<br />
<br />
Story: 3<br />
Art: 7<br />
Sound: 5<br />
Character: 3<br />
Enjoyment: 3<br />
Overall: 4

    &quot;I&#039;m bored. I&#039;m so bored. If i could sell my boredom, i&#039;m sure i could make a living.&quot; -Izayoi<br />
<br />
Ever dreamed of being the most powerful human on earth? The ability of giving absolute orders to others, or maybe be able to interact with animals? I&#039;m sure you all have. But, despite having these great powers, three teenagers (or we could say problem children) from different worlds and timelines felt bored. That is until someday they got a once in a lifetime chance to abandon their worlds and live in a dangerous, strange, yet fun and interesting world called &quot;little garden&quot; instead. <br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara

          <span style="display: none;" id="review132233">
        Kuru Sou Desu yo? follows the story of three problem children with psychic powers -and a rabbit- in a strange world called Little Garden, a world in which you must win the so called &#039;gift games&#039; to achieve higher reputation or authority of your &#039;community&#039;. <br />
<br />
The story itself is served in a rather fast paced way, so fast that even yourself might not catch up. Even so, it was never boring. There&#039;s always something new and unexpected every episode. Several myth such as gods from greek mythology, mystical creatures, magical spirits are presented in the story, eventhough they were modified a bit. Well, maybe a little more than a bit. The Jokes aren&#039;t something that could be forgotten. Personally, it got me laughing everytime and i just can&#039;t see it coming. <br />
<br />
Character progression is something that is quite lacking in this anime. They&#039;re too overpowered from the start of the first episode to have a decent progression. But who cares when you could enjoy watching teens fighting gods and demons -and winning- with a little to no effort at all. You might see a bit of some developing interaction between the characters, but don&#039;t expect too much from it tough.<br />

Graphics are quite stunning. Characters and backgrounds are drawn nicely. The colors are put beautifully. Animation seems wonderful too. Simply put, artwork and animation exceeded so well. It went all up my to my expectations, no, even higher. Such beautiful art is what present animes needs to have. <br />
<br />
Given all that, sounds are nothing exceptional. The soundtrack of this anime (the OP and ED) are originally made for the anime, and we could say that they did quite a pretty good job. I&#039;m not going to go too deep on the sounds, but i could say it really makes the mood. I kept singing it for while after watching it (which i rarely do). But i think what matters the most is music tastes. I don&#039;t know what you guys think so the judgement is all yours.<br />
<br />
Final Words<br />
<br />
10 episodes may not seem as much, but those 10 episodes that i watched really got me on a string. I enjoyed all those 24x10 minutes very much. I didn&#039;t regret those times i spent on watching at all. I even rewatched it. Why? Because, umm ,you know, ITS SO AWESOME. I hereby highly recommend this anime for everyone looking for a good time to waste on their screens. Trust me. Have faith in my words. <br />

    Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? Is easily the best anime of a lackluster winter lineup. Every Friday I start my day off hoping this anime is subbed by the time I wake up.  <br />
<br />
Story:(9)it&#039;s original, fun and new elements can be added in each episode.  There are some parts that I would like to go in further detail but that just knit picking. <br />
<br />
Art-(9)The art is clean with nice visuals and good actions scenes.  Though I don&#039;t care for the visuals too much so I can&#039;t go in further detail. <br />
<br />
Sounds-(9)The voice actors are all great.  The songs

          <span style="display: none;" id="review86107">
        even remind me of is this a zombie?(which is great)<br />
<br />
Character-(8)Now the 2 characters I love are black rabbit and Izayoi.  Black rabbit reminding me of hemeji from Baka and test.  While Izayoi is a strong character who seems to have it all.  Without going into to too much detail those two are defentitly refreshing from the weak willed characters.  My only problem is that Asuka and You do not have the same impact but that might change later since I am only 4 episodes in.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment-(10)When I watch this anime time just seems to fly by.  I don&#039;t even realize the end of the episode until the ending song begins.  Some animes I watch, I always end up looking how much time is left. This anime always leaves me wanting more, which is all I can ask for in watching an anime. <br />
<br />
Overall-(10)My overall is heavily based on enjoyment, which is the most important element  in my opinion. It has a little bit of everything from action,fantasy,romance and originality. Hopefully this anime doesn&#039;t let me down and make me eat my words.<br />

    Anime is a way for many of us to escape from our boring realities, and immerse ourselves into the worlds quite unlike our own.<br />
 <br />
Why did I start with such a cliche and cheesy statement on a review? Is this starting to sound like an essay? <br />
<br />
Well, to be fair, Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo (Problem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren&#039;t They) caters towards the type of individual described above. Individuals seeking to escape reality and adventure into a world of the unknown.<br />
<br />
Too bad the world in this anime stays &#039;unknown&#039;.<br />
<br />
There are many anime that take on the storyboard of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186878">
        &#039;traveling to a different dimension&#039;. Its a born and bred technique that, with minimal uncertainty, will definitely succeed to draw in the common anime watcher. Anime like Log Horizon, SAO, and No Game No Life first come into mind. However, with all my pride of an anime watcher at stake (if I have any), I will say that there is enjoyment in seeing this style of anime does entertain me to a certain extent. The creativity of the setting astounds us, and the ideas hidden within the protagonist&#039;s strengths evokes our imagination.<br />
<br />
&#039;Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?&#039; follows three characters with the extraordinary powers. The Strongest human, the ability to interact with animals, and the voice of absolute command are all, &#039;coincidentally&#039;, powers that immediately pop into the mind when speaking of supernatural powers that everyone wants.<br />
These three characters somehow are summoned into the dangerous world of &#039;Little Garden&#039;<br />
<br />
Hardly dangerous. <br />
<br />
In fact, the anime was very fast in introducing the power of our superhuman Izayoi, who defeats a water &#039;god&#039; in the span of 2 episodes. its a common event that we see in some anime like this. Antagonist underestimates protagonist at hand greatly, protagonist demolishes them with an unexplained skill, and the antagonist regretfully admits his/ her mistake. Of course, on paper it sounds cliche and cheesy, but fans love the moment when the antagonist is overwhelmed due to their sheer incompetence in fighting. Come on Water God, don&#039;t challenge our shounen protagonist with only your puny god fighting skills.<br />
<br />
The anime is hardly to blame for this. We see it regularly. Sora and Shiro from No Game No Life easily dispatch their humanity hating enemies. Don&#039;t get me started on Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei. In fact, this anime does well to show that brute force doesn&#039;t always win battles compared to the others. Strategy actually appears, albeit occasionally, in the anime. When it does, its hard to watch, as the enemies are so remarkably stupid it makes the strategy in place look well thought out.<br />
<br />
What the anime did well in though, was introducing the setting and story. The back-story is developed fairly well, and the majority of the plot-holes in the history that appear are subsequently covered with a brief explanation. Our protagonists discover the dilemma of the community of &#039;No Name&#039;. This community was at the bottom of the food chain in the world of Little Garden.<br />
<br />
What the story does not go in depth however, is the setting itself. Remember when I said the world stays unknown? The beautiful, imaginative idea of Little Garden is hardly developed. Its a flaw in the style of anime. Make the anime short and risk under developing the setting. Make the anime long to delve into the world and lose action and fast-paced storytelling along with it. Its a problem that is hard to correct. <br />
<br />
For a anime that deeply involves its characters into the plot-line, Character development is a missing piece to the puzzle. A short 10 episodes may attribute to the lack of development, but the reality is, the characters have no where to go! The moment the land on Little Garden, our protagonists are as overpowered as Goku is by the end of Dragon Ball Z. There is a bit of marginal growth for our characters power wise, of course with the exception of Superhuman Izayoi, who is so perfect in the power category that its hard not to become worse.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I go quite overboard with my little jabs at anime. The artwork in Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? is beautifully done. Characters have no glaring differences in artwork from one point of the anime to the next. The backgrounds are populated with significant detail. Every character looks unique in their own way, and are very distinguishable through artwork.<br />
<br />
Through there is far little in character development, the personalities of our protagonists are actually very unique and fairly intriguing. Each character has a unique personality that quite often suits their abilities and appearance. Because of this, when these characters initiate their abilities, it actually feels as if the the abilities they possess are unique to them only.<br />
<br />
                                       ...<br />
<br />
When individuals rate an anime, they rate it either through their enjoyment or how well the anime is made. Of course, both these two factors influence one and another, but they are also distinctly separate. Someone can watch a plot-hole filled, disturbing, unimaginative anime and still receive enjoyment because it may fulfill with what that individual may want. Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? has some glaring mistakes that all anime of its type possesses, but I cannot say that it didn&#039;t have its good points, and that I didn&#039;t enjoy it. Many of its problems revolve around the shortness of the anime, along with the cliffhanger ending. However, there is more to come, and when that time comes, there will be individuals to either praise it, or judge it no matter what the outcome. <br />
<br />
6/10 - Good<br />
<br />
<br />
(Please don&#039;t think that 6 is bad, for those of you, because I base my ratings off of the word descriptions (ie good, very good, mediocre) rather than the number)<br />

    First time writing a review but I&#039;ve wanted to give it a go for a while now.<br />
<br />
Anyways!<br />
<br />
For me this was one of those anime that gets you so engaged that at the end of each episode you are like &quot;god dammit not another week!&quot;<br />
<br />
Well it was like that for me.<br />
<br />
First let&#039;s talk about the story, not going into this too deeply the story is about three kids from different backgrounds who have a gift and are sort of bored with their lifestyle until a letter appears transporting them to this brand new world.<br />
<br />
The series revolves around gift games. These are pre-arranged battles with specific rules.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review89839">
        In such games I suppose one could say a wager is placed. I want to explain this more but I really don&#039;t want to spoil anything! So just watch ha.<br />
<br />
The artwork is beautiful. I can&#039;t say much more about this. So much &quot;aww factor&quot; The ending is cute!<br />
<br />
Sound, well the voices are beautiful fitting the characteristics of everyone perfectly! and the music is fitting. I love the OP theme so much and the ED theme is cute but not enough to avoid being skipped now and then haha.<br />
<br />
Character, Well perfect!<br />
<br />
The male protagonist is so cool. (like he should be) the female leads are cute. What I liked about this anime is that even though vulnerability was around it wasn&#039;t to the point where you had wasted episodes of the characters reflecting on how much they suck and just being a downer. Which in all fairness I understand why it is used in most anime as it gives us something to relate to! but we don&#039;t need that in this one!<br />
<br />
It&#039;s all about being awesome. Because you know. It is. which brings me to enjoyment I loved this anime. What more can i say? The fight scenes are amazing! So much diversity and not every battle is the same. Each fight had a different purpose and type of opponent and the tactics changed making things so much more interesting! <br />
<br />
And fan service? Well the problem with a lot of anime is that they rely on just fanservice for their laughs. Which being a guy I get it. (yeah you know what i mean -dirty grin-) but in this anime i wouldn&#039;t say it was suttle but it was just not overpowering? If it was removed yes it wouldn&#039;t be so funny but the anime would still be great!<br />
<br />
So overall? I gave this a 10/10. The few qualms I have are that the anime is too short! and because of the attitudes of the characters you kind of know how things are going to end but that is made up for with how they are going to get there. But yeah, this has to be the best anime this winter. So much rewatchability, there&#039;s a few episodes that I watched an extra time already.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d recommend this to anyone whether they be hardcore anime nuts or just casual. There is something here for everyone.<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading. I hope my first review was good enough. see you again. Maybe. :)

    It&#039;s kinda sad that I have to give this show such a low score but it was just very generic... enjoyable non the less, but generic.<br />
<br />
From the synopsis it already sound generic as heck, 3 teenagers with superpowers go to an alternative reality to fight a demon lord. Well if that isn&#039;t something we have never seen before...<br />
<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The story makes hardly any sense and I also had a hard time following all the concepts that are thrown at you. That was mostly because of the bad pacing the show had. It felt really rushed (obviously with only 10 episodes) and thus never had time to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review90525">
        explain anything in greater depths.<br />
What was that world, how do these gift games work, how does the whole timeline thing work. All these things have to be excepted to enjoy this show, because they get loosely attention, while the story never really focuses on something.<br />
Well besides the whole No-Names and building up their reputation.<br />
On a good note I can say it was sometimes really funny and because of its length never felt unimportant, the episodes also all were quite enjoyable to watch even though it kinda jumped in time here and there without any sense of progression.<br />
<br />
4/10 Decent<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
From a realism point of view the characters all felt quite one dimensional and stereotypical, but have shown possible character development. It all hinges upon the number of Episodes and how they tried to tell and show you as much as possible, character had almost no time to establish. But they sure gave all the characters their screentime without focusing on one too much and on the other to little.<br />
Motivations of all characters felt very sketchy though, be it villain or hero. They all just kinda did their stuff.<br />
But I can say that I still greatly enjoyed them. Izayoi was pure gold being a bad ass superhuman he was, was fresh and entertaining. The girls where all likable and gave you some fanservice points if you are looking for that, at least each girl was for some sort of fetish available.<br />
<br />
6/10 Fair<br />
<br />
Animation<br />
Studio Diomedea who animated this show didn&#039;t really do anything outstanding.<br />
Actionscenes were mostly cut and static, or did use pan shots to save work/money. Overall the quality was rather generic as well as the artstyle.<br />
I did like the character designs. They kinda reminded me (in case ofAsuka) of Type Moon. It didn&#039;t look bad but also not great. There isn&#039;t much to say here to be honest.<br />
<br />
5/10 Mediocre<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The opening was pretty cool and I liked that Iori Nomizu sung both (OP and ED).<br />
I liked her performance in the openings of Kore wa Zombie desu ka? a lot, this song wasn&#039;t as great as the catchy rocksongs in Kore wa Zombie desu ka?.<br />
The Ending was kinda meh... didn&#039;t like it.<br />
Though both fit the show, energetic, kinda cute.<br />
As already mentioned Iori Nomizu voiced Kurousagi and I just like her.<br />
The other VAs did a good job as usual in most anime nowadays. Nothing stood out besides Satomi Arai which has one of the most unique voices in the buisiness. She is known from the Raildex shows as Kuroko and I just love her quirky voice.<br />
Funny thing to mention as a side note, in this show she also plays the roll of a lesbian pervert DFC loli...<br />
The OST is forgettable and not mentionable.<br />
<br />
6/10<br />
<br />
Value and Enjoyment<br />
I fused both to one together because they are kinda similar.<br />
I think I will not re watch it or some episodes, but I sure would watch a second season if one comes out.<br />
On a sentimental level it had no big impact. I don&#039;t wanna keep it, or will remember it for a great anime I&#039;ve seen. It was enjoyable as it lasted but nothing worth while.<br />
On a historical level there is no arguing that this anime will be forgotten quickly and will have no impact what so ever.<br />
<br />
I did enjoy the characters, from both an design standpoint and form a personality one. The opening was also okay, but the rest was kinda meh.<br />
<br />
5/10<br />
<br />
Overall this anime gets a 5/10 which is sad, I think it could have been better. <br />
<br />
But as said in the introduction, it was really enjoyable. If you are looking for some fantasy action show with some cool characters that are a but out of the general stereotypes give it a try.<br />
If not you are not missing out.<br />

    Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? is a very good anime series. It&#039;s a kind of Alice in Wonderland mixed with Fairy Tail sort of series. Each of the three main characters have unique abilities and they all fill a nice little niche in this show. I have to say that it is much better than it sounds from the synopsis, and it had me from the first episode. This series is a high 8 in my book, and I highly recommend it.<br />
<br />
The artwork and animation are of course very good. In the last few years animation has really shined with embracing high

          <span style="display: none;" id="review89857">
        definition, and there is a certain quality that we are getting used to (and in some cases expecting). This series holds that quality and doesn&#039;t waver. It has catchy intro music, and the songs throughout each episode fit very nicely into the story. Best of all, the voice acting works really well. This series delivers in the most basic and necessary of areas which gives it a couple of shiny gold stars.<br />
<br />
The characters are kind of up and down. I think it was the amount of young children characters that filled the story. It was a bit much at times, but the main and most important of characters were so well done that I could ignore that fact. Everyone had bright and lively personalities, and they were developed very well considering the lack of background stories. In fact, we do get a little of a couple characters backgrounds, but mostly we are left with questions. It&#039;s not a major flaw in the design, but it is what brought the series down to an 8 instead of a 9 for me. I wanted to know much much more about the main characters because that was the biggest mystery in this story.<br />
<br />
Mentioning story, I do have the say that the simple yet entertaining plot was fun to watch. I compared this show to Alice and Wonderland and Fairy Tail for a very big reason. You get your zany magical fighting and action, and then you have your bizarre spiritual world storyline/themes/concept. This is not a ripoff of either, it&#039;s actually very different in a lot ways, but it just reminded me so much of those two. The entire point of this story is that these three human kids from different dimensions have to help save this community of &quot;no-names&quot; by competing for them in magical games in this sort of fairy tale/spiritual dimension/world. If you love fantasy, that&#039;s what you get.<br />
<br />
Where this series goes wrong is in how short it is. I wish it was done in a few more episodes. I wish we had more background of the characters. I wish I would stop saying &quot;I wish&quot;. Seriously though, it has some flaws, but I really enjoyed it. It has high repeat value, and it has a lot of good things going for it. It is based on a light novel series that I have not read, but I hope there is more to come in a second series/season. If not, then I can whimper and say &quot;fine&quot; and maybe deal with the cliffhanger/open ending that we are left with.<br />
<br />
All that aside, this is a must see for fantasy geeks like myself. It&#039;s fun and at times a little exciting. It has good humor and much more. Check this short series out.

    Ok, so the 10 episode anime has recently ended and I like the fact that studio Diomedea has limit it to just 10 episode, so without further adieu, I present my ratings for this anime:<br />
<br />
Story &amp; Art: Mediocre 5.<br />
<br />
The story is a typical good versus evil kind of thing which is more likely appropriated for audience who are in a age range of 10 to 15 years old since the main climax was typical of people from another world whom where called upon to help fight in an alternate universe and in this case it revolves around the 3 teenagers from another world with special

          <span style="display: none;" id="review90055">
        abilities called &quot;Gifts,&quot; who where invited to join up with the &quot;No Names&quot; by a seemly clumsy bunny girl named &quot;Kurouasagi,&quot; in order to participate is the so called &#039;Gift Games.&quot;  The Art in general was for me...................just the usual though some Kurousagi fanservice would have added some spice in it.<br />
<br />
Sound: Good 7.<br />
<br />
I simply just like both opening and closing theme.<br />
<br />
Character: Fair 6.<br />
<br />
Now the thing about the characters in this anime, more emphasis was given to  the 3 teenagers which is good, but the let down was Kurousagi, she did invited the 3 teenagers to come to the &quot;  Miniature Garden&quot; and participate in the &quot;Gift Games&quot; but for her to stand as a regulator of the games while belonging with the &quot;No Names&quot;  was a bit odd. I&#039;d probably say that her character to not fight for the &#039;No Names&quot; unless there where circumstances that permits her was a total misplacement for her role. Writer  Tarō Tatsunoko<br />
 should have considered Jin Russel be in the shoes of Kurousagi, and Kurousagi should have had a separate role one which she has no alliance with anyone except be the game moderator.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Good 7.<br />
<br />
Basically, the enjoyable part of this anime was action genre combine with fantasy which was based around the &#039;Pied Piper of Hamlin,&quot; but generally speaking   it was Izayoi&#039;s kickass action that makes up for the enjoyable part of this anime.  <br />
<br />
Overall: Fair 6.<br />
<br />
The anime did have a comedy genre, but it was limited to Kurousagi being pissed with the 3 teenagers who are looking for action, thought the title  &quot;Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?&quot; trasnlates to &quot;Problem Children are Coming from Another World, Aren&#039;t They??&quot; was a bit of a patsy it was fair enough to be enjoyed. But for this anime to be given higher score for its overall, doesn&#039;t really count since studio Diomedea misuses the children&#039;s fantasy story &quot;The Piped Piper of Hamlin&quot; by giving it a darker side was unnecessary to say the least, as for the anime&#039;s title, it is something that should have been use in a genre that has a extreme action where the so called problem children are the main bad guys.<br />
<br />
<br />
And so my review ends, will this anime have a season 2?????I think studio Diomedea should just limit it to a couple of OVA&#039;s.

    Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? is one of those latent hidden gems you see every so often. People who love Dog Days will love this anime from start to finish. Which brings me to the why in the hell is there only 10 episodes of this anime. BLASPHEMY. <br />
<br />
-Story-<br />
The three main characters have these amazing powers and are bored with the regular world. An envelope arrives for each person. They&#039;ve been summoned by the Black Rabbit to help the community &quot;No Name&quot; to overthrow the Devil King.<br />
What I absolutely love about this series is how they incorporate mythical stories and what not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review89461">
        into the anime. I haven&#039;t seen something this good along those lines since Campione! <br />
<br />
-Art-<br />
The art is incredible and the characters are drawn so very well. Every character has their own unique charisma about them. Everything is colorful, the girls are cute. This is the first time I think I fell in love with a furry.<br />
<br />
-Sound-<br />
It&#039;s sound. The ending and opening themes are okay. Nothing extraordinary about this series. The cast is very awesome though. The way Kurousagi answers Yes in English is very cute.<br />
<br />
-Character-<br />
This brings the best out of the show. Due to the nature of the show every character good or bad is unique. because of the mythology incorporated into the show, this highlights how well this series is. Izayoi is the strongest badass around. Asuka needs a little more character build up, but she started to shine in later episodes getting a grasp of her powers. You Kasugabe is a unique design with the qualities of animals. Kurousagi (Black Rabbit) is just awesome all together. almost a female version of Izayoi.<br />
<br />
-Enjoyment-<br />
This series is totally worth every minute and numerous amounts of re watch. It isn&#039;t super fan serviced at all. It&#039;s just about perfect all around. <br />
<br />
-Overall-<br />
Fun and exciting. I can&#039;t believe it is only 10 episodes long. I hope to hear an announcement for a second season soon.

    Mondaiji<br />
I just finished Mondaiji and i wanted to end this in one day but it took me 5 days to finally relax myself from the things i was doing and finished this already, i felt this needed more episodes or another season because it was short, it has just 11 episodes counting the OVA and i wanted to see more, i felt hooked to follow the story and what is to come for them.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The story revolves around three characters from different times but from the same world and they receive an invitation because they have powers and they&#039;re needed, all of a sudden the three

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195640">
        of them are falling from the sky to this fantasy world they&#039;ve never seen before and they meet Kuro Usagi and she explains them the situation and ask for their help for  the community that is called &#039;&#039;No Name&#039;&#039; to rise up to be a great community with their aid, Azuka and Kasukabe agree and Izayoi accepts to help but later. The story is very good, it&#039;s well paced and really well adapted, it&#039;s not perfect and not something we haven&#039;t seen before but it makes little mistakes and it&#039;s solid and interesting.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation<br />
The art style wasn&#039;t amazing, and this anime is almost recent so they could have done the animations and background art style even better but it was good overall.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The music was great, the OP is really enjoyable and the ED is really funny, the voice acting was very good and the background sound and music fight was great.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
The development was great for being a 10 episodes anime, they give you what you need to know about them and make them interesting since the beginning and how they get to develope their powers, Izayoi is overpowered and i wanted to know the reason, we don&#039;t get to know Izayoi that much but you only ask yourself that at the end, Azuka and Kasukaba were interesting and well developed, more than Izayoi in the sense that we get to know a little more about them than Izayoi, Usagi was a great character, every episode knowing a little bit more about her and is surprising how badass she can be, there were some flaws with support characters and the Main ones but overall was very good.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
I really enjoyed this anime but i felt it was too short and needed more episodes but that&#039;s my thought of wanting more, it was fun to watch this, at first i saw Izayoi a bit like a douche and cocky but at the 2nd episode and from that on he was an overpowered cocky badass, but as i stated it was short so it was a very good enjoyment.

    It&#039;s easy to say if an anime is a Light Novel adaptation just by how long is the title. Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo don&#039;t escape the rule. Only 4 episodes are out, but by seeing how a lot of animes of this winter are boring, it&#039;s not an exaggeration to make this one of my favourite. <br />
<br />
Story - 7<br />
The story focused on 3 childs who received a power at birth, named &#039;gift&#039;. They are sent to another world by Kurosagi (Black &#039;sexy&#039; Rabbit) to help her with her community.<br />
Since this world turn around a &#039;gift&#039; competition, the show mix action, fantasy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review85539">
        and supernatural. <br />
The story in itself is good, it has some suspens, and is correctly developped.<br />
<br />
Art - 9<br />
Smooth and clean. Character design is one of my favourite, and backgrounds are nice.<br />
<br />
Sound - 8<br />
The opening is amazing, and the ending is funny. The sound don&#039;t seem bad during the show.<br />
<br />
Character - 7<br />
While Izayoi is your average cliché of overpowered-highschool boy, which I really like, the others don&#039;t really shine by themself, apart from Kurosagi who is quite funny and support what you can call a light fanservice.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 9<br />
It&#039;s really interesting to follow this show, since there is some mystery, specially about Izayoi&#039;s gift. I&#039;m personaly following this show with impatience and interest, and surely until the end.<br />
<br />
Overall - 8<br />
It&#039;s really easy to give it an 8, since it&#039;s pratically the only supernatural and action show this winter, supernatural being my favourite genre.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re going to watch this show, you should have some things in mind. Firstly, there is some &#039;light&#039; fanservice. It don&#039;t really disturb the show, but some are so haters of that, that it might be underlined. Then, it&#039;s a Light Novel adaptation, so, to keep the book being saled, it have some lacks in the story and character development. If you saw Sword Art Online, then you can deduce that it will have the same sorts of lacks, as a rushed story for example.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re into supernatural, over-powered children and a little of action and fan-service, you should give it a try.

    Fantasy, Supernatural, Action, and a little dash of Comedy. Those are just some of the ingredients that make up Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?. A Girl with the &quot;Geass&quot; type of gift, A Girl with a wooden necklace that can copy a gift of another, a high school boy that has an unknown gift that could kill gods and destroy the heavens, and lets not forget the bunny girl with huge, um... you get my point.<br />
<br />
Story/Plot: 7/10<br />
<br />
I&#039;m quite a little bit disappointed in the plot, it has this feel of having the same flow as the anime &quot;Fairy Tail&quot;. <br />
Let me site

          <span style="display: none;" id="review86803">
        the plot flow of the two anime:<br />
1.) Problem rises involving their Guild/Community.<br />
2.) Group shows a little worried on the current situation.<br />
3.) Anime shows a little shady background of an unknown character.<br />
4.) An/Most of ally gets Wounded/Captured.<br />
5.) Protagonist defeats the enemy/ wins the gift game.<br />
6.) A new ally is accepted to their Guild/Community.<br />
<br />
What i&#039;m saying here is that Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? has predictable outcomes so far after viewing the 5 episodes. The male protagonist is obviously  &quot;Imbalanced&quot; in a very obvious way of defeating Gods. But hey, the series ain&#039;t finished yet, we&#039;ll see if this deserves more than 7 in the future.<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
<br />
Just awesome, Animation is not the &quot;Moe moe&quot; type that i love, but it still gives that feel of a satisfying animation. Surroundings are well detailed as well as the characters. And may i just add, this anime has one of the best ED animation EVER! The chibis dancing in a very smooth way just makes me very very happy, and that&#039;s the main reason i gave the animation a 10.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10.<br />
<br />
Sounds here are great, the voices of the characters matches their appearance/mood. Background music was fine, yada yada yada. OP Music is like the Kore wa zombie desu ka OP/ED Music, which i find very good.<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10.<br />
<br />
Characters are very good. Although the other one that has the &quot;unknown&quot; gift is too much. Overall an 8 is quite enough. Girls that can Copy and Command, a vampire/a former demon lord, a teenage high school boy with a gift that destroys the heavens. But the bunny girl does it all.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10.<br />
<br />
Depends on how we define Enjoyment in an anime. Some defines enjoyment as having the feeling of impatience or more specifically, can&#039;t wait for a week for the next episode. Some define enjoyment as loving the twists in the plot, and making predictions and being able to discuss it with others.The unique set rules in every gift game made me excited(By finding loopholes in the rules.) and those two definitions about enjoyment made me give the 8 out of 10.Yeah sure, we all think a week is torture for waiting for the next episode, but i find this anime hard to discuss with other people, well mostly because we all have the same ideas on whats going to happen next. Unless this anime will reveal more secrets in the future. Don&#039;t forget were only halfway through the series.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8.4/10<br />
<br />
Everything is very good, except for the plot that is. A no name community that was destroyed by demon lords. Suddenly three humans with extraordinary gifts is called from their own worlds by a bunny girl(Yey!). Now they plan to revive the community to its former self. Pretty good so far right? But the Hows are my problem...<br />
<br />
So how do they revive the guild? <br />
-They participate in gift games and win!<br />
<br />
So how do they win in gift games? <br />
-By using the girl that can command almost anything.<br />
-By using the girl that can copy the enemy&#039;s abilities.<br />
-By using the high school teenage boy that can destroy the heavens and defeat the gods.<br />
<br />
TL;DR<br />
Protagonists are imbalanced, and didn&#039;t show any costs on using their powers halfway through the series. Though, it&#039;s still a must watch for me, and highly recommended.

    What can I say, after finishing this 10 ep anime, I&#039;d say that I find most of it&#039;s category as pretty much mediocre. So I&#039;m no longer gonna make any deliberations and I&#039;ll just get straight to the point:<br />
<br />
Mediocre 5.<br />
<br />
Story- The story in general was typical of a group of weak members who needs to outsource it&#039;s battle by taking in a trio of special kids whom are too bored in the world they live in, which for them to be in such alternate universe like the so called &#039;Little garden.&#039; and as usual it involves a lotta made up terminologies like the Conejo Negra&#039;s

        ( I&#039;m referring to Kurousagi) gift called &quot;Spear of Indra,&quot; Izayoi&#039;s  &quot;Code: Unknown,&quot; Asuka&#039;s  &quot;Oraculum&quot; and You&#039;s &quot;Genome Arbor - Non Priorum.&quot; Where them trio ( the conejo negra not inculded)  have to participate in the watchamcallit  &quot;Gift Game,&quot; and as usual of a typical fantasy genre it shift&#039;s from one plot to a sub plot and to another plot.<br />
<br />
Character-  The tres adolescentes which were compose of Izayoi, Asuka and You are not bad in respect to their roles, since they are the problem children that this anime&#039;s title was referring to. But to call them problem children was a bit of an overstatement since they don&#039;t look like a trio of delinquents rather they&#039;re just bored. But the Conejo Negra (I&#039;m referring to Kurousagi)... well, I don&#039;t dig as to why she&#039;s given that name since only her top blouse and her knee high socks are black- I don&#039;t know about her underwear, anyway for a character like her to be given such a name is befitting for an antagonist or to a support character who is protagonist with a dark side  and if I were director, Yasutaka Yamamoto, I would have given her role to Shiroyasha. Also, her role is some what of a double standard that though she is a member of the &#039;No Names&#039; she is also the overseer of the &#039;Gift Game&#039; that she cannot fight for her own side unless there are certain breaking of the rules that permit her to do so which is why she should have been in the shoes of  Shiroyasha, and Shiroyasha should be in the Conejo Negra&#039;s shoes.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- Humm, so I may have given this anime&#039;s enjoyment a mediocre score, but still it was enjoyable enough to be watched since this anime has an action genre in it where the battle between good and evil is something to look forward to and that&#039;s as good as it gets.<br />
<br />
Overall- Overall, the title &quot;Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?&quot; really doesn&#039;t befit this anime as a whole, but given the action part of this anime, I&#039;d say it was still worth giving it a benefit of a doubt. I do commend studio Diomedea  for just limiting it to 10 ep.<br />
<br />
<br />
Decent 4.<br />
<br />
Art- I can only say that the art was wholesome that there was no fanservice for the pirreos to howl for.<br />
<br />
Poor 3.<br />
<br />
Sound- I hate both opening and closing themes, finish.<br />
<br />
<br />
Adios amigos.

    &quot;I&#039;m bored, really bored. If I could sell my boredom, I&#039;m confident I could make a living.&quot; -- Izayoi Sakamaki<br />
<br />
There were some moments in this anime where I thought exactly this. Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? or the English name for it Problem Children are coming from another world, aren’t they? (addressed to as Mondaiji in this review) is an action anime and is very proud of being one – the anime has action flowing from its ears! Now by excluding things like plot and character development, Mondaiji has done two things which are very noticeable:	<br />
1.	Limit your audience.<br />
2.	Minimize the critique which can

          <span style="display: none;" id="review102515">
        be thrown at you.<br />
<br />
The plot centers on 3 main protagonists, namely: <br />
-	Izayoi Sakamaki<br />
-	Asuka Kudou<br />
-	You Kasukabe<br />
<br />
The first of the three: Izayoi Sakamaki is a very arrogant and cocky boy. He will do anything to get his dose of entertainment. The second is Asuka Kudou, the archetype rich girl would fit her very much, and she seems to be able to do things with her own two hands. So I wouldn’t say she is that much of a cliché. Lastly, You Kasukabe, the quiet girl of the trio. If you have seen more than a dozen of anime, she should strike you as similar. Now these three get an envelope and they are magically teleported to a place called Little Garden. They are to entertain themselves with Gift games here and to join a guild. These Gift Games can be about anything and for anything. They can help the guild you join grow, or for personal pleasure. <br />
<br />
Basically, they are roaming free in a MMORPG world. <br />
<br />
If you paid attention to that last line, it will sound very familiar. Indeed, they have also jumped the bandwagon of incorporating MMORPG features in their anime, the 2 before them are Sword Art Online and Accel World and have done similar things. But everyone has their own perception and ideas; you can do a lot of things with the gaming theme. <br />
<br />
What I found a rather good move on the author’s part was to really target a selected audience and stick with it. The fact that the main characters have no flaws, the story is not deep whatsoever and that it has a gaming theme. With these facts you can easily pick out the audience the author was trying to reach with his writing: the gamer audience who like short, sweet and action-packed anime (and might not have too large of an attention span). With this move you won’t entertain the watcher who comes across this and tries it on a whim, so I would say this anime has its fair share of dislikes due to the small audience it targets.<br />
<br />
On to the plot: Non-existent. Yes, unfortunately this anime doesn’t have much of a plot. It has one, but it is put on a sidetrack. The main characters try to revive a guild that was destroyed by an evil demon lord (which we do not see in the series). Now that is its plot, what do they focus on? Fanservice, fighting things for no good reason and generally lure you towards watching it with pretty visual and before mentioned fights. Now, with a series that lasts 10 episodes (10 x 24 minutes), you wouldn’t be able to focus on both the plot and actually fighting without moving the story slower than a snail’s dead born hatchling. So now you might be wondering, does this show only deliver fights? Yes, and with quantity.<br />
<br />
The fights which sometimes are with reason and sometimes not, are phenomenal eye-candy and most likely the only reason you would like this show. Now the so called “gifts” of this show are pretty much psychic powers, the show does a very bad job at explaining what gifts can include and what kind of gifts exist. <br />
Because the show does not clarify this, the fights the show produces are sometimes somewhat hard to follow. The main thing which irked me about this is that the main male protagonist is a mystery. He just seems to have high physical abilities. Keeping a lot of things shrouded on the action which is their main attraction is a very bad move.<br />
<br />
Another thing which caught my attention is the fact that they go out of their way to include a lot of stuff (the fact that elves, dwarves etc exist), but they never do anything with this setting. All the characters have a human form and the whole concept is forgotten about, except for the small fairy which appears the last two episodes. <br />
<br />
Now on to some positive qualities this show possesses. Not that I enjoy this myself, but the fanservice was done in a way it didn’t become annoying. The girl characters didn’t become tools for the fanservice moments which happened each 3 minutes. Although there was the occasional lewd moment, it was done subtle and I probably could count all the moments on 1 hand. So hats off to them for making it a bearable experience for the female watcher.<br />
<br />
The fact that this is only 10 episodes also has its positive effects. Since you spend a measly 240 minutes on this show, it isn’t that big of a time investment. So even if you disliked it, you wouldn’t have wasted that much of your precious, precious time. The fact that it had created such a big world with so many possibilities could mean that they can obtain a return in a year or so, depending on BD sales and other merchandise. If they were to get another season, they would have plenty of potential material. <br />
<br />
How it breaks away from other action anime is quite the pleasant surprise as well. Most anime around that genre with the demographic shounen attached to it are about the main protagonists overcoming hardships. The antagonists for each arc are consequently beaten to a pulp without too much effort. This one is quite different, the characters are already on that level, and they have nothing to overcome. So I guess you are in for a surprise when you watch this anime regardless of what you expect or do not expect. Now from what I gather on ratings and personal opinions, a lot of people liked the completely overpowered main character who wipes the floor with each adversary he comes across. Personally, I like my characters to have a taste of defeat, but again, this way it complements the fact that the series is only 10 episodes long.<br />
<br />
Now on to the animated part of the series, this includes how the characters are drawn. This is my main point of critique on this section as well. I found the characters models to be very bland. And why in god’s name is Izayoi wearing those headphones - is he listening to music 24/7 or something? Now on to more relevant stuff... The animation was absolutely amazing in this show; you would expect that when it comes to fast moving characters and projectiles the show would make them a tad static. Although there is a hint of it here and there, the actually animated parts are done nicely. So that is a plus which I would like to give it.<br />
<br />
And that concludes our animation section, as I do not know enough of studios to compare this work to other stuff they did.<br />
<br />
Now the sound, we can separate this into:<br />
-	Soundtrack<br />
-	Ops/Eds<br />
-	Voice actors<br />
<br />
The soundtrack was done up to a good standard. They had some fast paced music in there when the characters were fighting and slightly, more relaxed music as they were having a conversation. The opening and ending were pretty good. Now my main taste is definitely not in J-POP, but I kind of liked these ones. As for the voice actors, they did a fair enough job I’d say. The main male who has a very arrogant and cocky attitude was done well by his respective voice actor. I think the rest of the cast has done a quite good job as well. <br />
<br />
We have arrived at the character section now. There isn’t a lot left for me to say. We will start with the English title; Problem Children are coming from another world, aren’t they? Because problem children are what they are, they constantly try to entertain themselves, at the cost of other characters, whether it is the supporting cast or the antagonists. I talked about archetypes in the beginning of this review, the princess one/tsundere and the silent girl/kuudere one. Although there is hardly romance in this anime, so the tsundere and kuudere are not really necessary, we could view these girls as such. I think the writer has done quite well to break away from the cliché; both are not annoying within their role. <br />
 <br />
Another thing which I found mediocre on this show was the motivation, especially when they are interacting with each other. “It will be fun.” This seems to be the sole motivation for each character – and to be honest, this is a bit on the weak side.<br />
<br />
And let us move to the conclusion. So overall I thought Mondaiji was a weak anime, as it did not have a concrete plot or any apparent character development. Although these words might seem harsh, I did in fact enjoy Mondaiji. The action in it was sublime and I was as excited as any jolly teenager would be seeing this. I give it 5 out of 10! <br />

    I was only able to watch 6 out of the 10 episodes of this anime, partly because my eyes glazed over as this anime did another explanation of some rule or reference and gave a mini wiki page about it and partly because I don&#039;t want to. Some of you may call this inaccurate, I call it efficient. <br />
<br />
The plot is weak at best. 3 Kids get sucked into a wormhole and end up in some rpg type world where races and things of all sorts duel each other for supplies, goods, people and clan rights(which all gets explained in a monologue). They meet fan-service

          <span style="display: none;" id="review108129">
        rabbit and join her recently destroyed clan that has nothing but starving kids. They lost everything in a forced duel with bad people (no explanation here) and now are going rebuild and fight the bad people using the three kids that somehow got there. The general premise is overly complicated as before each new thing they introduce, they go through a monologue: Here is mushroom kingdom, the inhabitants are the cybermen, otaku, and spartans, don&#039;t worry though there is a natural light barrier that keeps the light out and otaku happy, also blahblahblah.. <br />
<br />
The over-the-top details however aren&#039;t as bad as the details that are left out and these details are the important story line ones. Both parties need to accept the duel before it is started. However the bad people can challenge us and take all our stuff even though we never gave consent.~no explanation~ (screw the rules, I have money). The bad guys have a name but we don&#039;t know what they really look like or the reason why they did this action.<br />
<br />
 It also doesn&#039;t make sense why the three kids like each-other and like the fan-service rabbit and her flea-bitten kids. The 5 second back story for each of them implies that all of the three are lonely but that makes sense because one is a control freak, one is a sadist, and the last only talks to animals. Now for some reason now that they are in a new world, they are social butterflies that do good for other people. They could go with the new world, new person path but they don&#039;t change personalities when it comes to interactions with people outside their clan. Why does the male lead wear earphones that aren&#039;t connected to anything? Are they earmuffs or is he secretly listening to Beiber or secret orders from Kim Jong Un? So many important questions go unanswered in this anime.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the art it makes Dragon Ball Z look like it came out last year. The music and sounds they play have little to no correlation to the anime and its as if the video and audio department were communicating through a pasta noodle that broke in the middle. The OP is about being forced into a imprisoning world and destroying that world but the three kids were gods in their back-story worlds. The characters and their personalities make no sense nor are they consistent and are molded to the scene by the convenience of the author.<br />
<br />
 The light and dark in this anime are poorly balanced and this is easily explained in the scene where the main characters joke about the sexual use of the fan-service rabbit then when another character proclaims his lust the tone went from joking about sex to chauvinistic men-are-pigs attitude. It&#039;s almost as if the anime tried to pander to all ages but its too dark for children and its too childish for adults. <br />
<br />
I watched this anime all the way to the 6th episode because I like giving anime a chance to surprise me, even if it starts off poorly, with something innovative or good. The only thing that has surprised me about this anime is how I&#039;ve lasted through the 6th episode without melting my brain

    *This is a review of the original ten episodes and the OVA.<br />
<br />
This was a series that I was really interested in watching, but never really got around to it until the summer of 2014. The title by itself was interesting enough, but after I had read the plot summary and saw that it had received good reviews, I decided to watch this series. I enjoyed watching it so much that I decided to re-watch it last week, and while I didn’t get the same amount of enjoyment from the first time I watched it, Problem Children was still a really fun series to watch.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Problem Children

          <span style="display: none;" id="review176849">
        Are Coming From Another World, Aren’t They (Problem Children)’s story revolves around three humans with extraordinary abilities. These abilities make everyday life extremely boring or unfulfilling for these individuals. That was until, one day, they each received a mysterious letter that said that if they gave up all of their friends, family, and worldly possessions, that they would have an opportunity to test the limits of their powers. They are then transported to the world of Little Garden, a world inhabited by several different types of creatures, and run by a series of supernatural events called “Gift Games”. The three humans run into Black Rabbit, the being who summoned them to this newfound world. They quickly discover that Little Garden isn’t just fun and games. Little Garden is the home of several different communities, each having it’s own name, flag, and status in the world. Black Rabbit is a part of the community known as the “No Names” because all of their status was stolen from them during a Gift Game against a demon lord. She brought these three problem children to Little Garden hoping that they would join the “No Names” in their quest to recapture their lost status.<br />
<br />
While I enjoyed Problem Children’s story, it definitely had its flaws. The first issue I have the story is how many things weren’t fully explained or explored. The biggest question I have about the story is about the world of Little Garden itself. You’re not really given much information about Little Garden other than the fact that it exists, and while they do mention something about a “Parallel World Intersection Theory” it is never explained. Little Garden also seems to have elements from several different works of literature and religions. It showcases characters and tales from Shinto to the Brothers Grimm, and they never explain how any of this works. Also, Little Garden is massive, it was estimated to be about the size of the sun, and so much of the world isn’t shown or explained to us. They mention that there are several communities and races within the Little Garden, but we don’t get to see a whole lot of them. Which is definitely a shame, because the world itself is extremely interesting and I would’ve loved to learn more about it. The final issue I have with the series involves one the series’ main plot points. That being how exactly did the demon lords forced the now “No Names”, and others like them, into a gift game where all of their status was on the line. It’s another thing that was never explained in the series.<br />
<br />
The story also doesn’t come to a very satisfying conclusion. While the last episode does wrap up the events of the conflict that was taking place, the journey of the “No Names” was far from over. The characters had even set goals that they wanted to accomplish earlier in the series, and we never got to see those fulfilled. Overall, even though it was a good ending to the arc they were in, it wasn’t a good ending for the series, so lets hope they decided to make a second season.<br />
<br />
As for the OVA, extra fanservice aside, it just felt like more of the same, which was a good thing. But, it just served as another reminder that the story isn’t over. It’s never specifies whether the events in the OVA take place during or after the events of the first season, but either way it only makes you want more.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
<br />
There really isn’t a whole lot to say about the animation other than that it’s good. Everything in the series is animated really well. The character models, background scenery, and fights scenes are all done really well. While there is nothing spectacular here, it is definitely good, quality animation.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Problem Children has a vast and varied soundtrack with songs that can compliment any scene in the series. If the scene is tense and a little creepy, a tense and eerie song will compliment it. If the scene is lighthearted and upbeat, the soundtrack provides us with a lighthearted and upbeat song to compliment this as well. The soundtrack features songs that have a good amount repeatability, and is complimented by a solid opening and incredibly catchy ending.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
This series stars four main characters, the three “Problem Children” You Kasukabe, Asuka Kudou, and Izayoi Sakamaki, and the person who summoned them to Little Garden, Black Rabbit. As mentioned earlier, all the three of the problem children have special abilities that made their lives boring or unfulfilling, which is why they were invited to Little Garden. During the course of the series, you’ll start to understand why each of the characters decided to come to Little Garden, and see them start of growing as characters. Initially, the characters might just seem like incredibly basic and one dimensional characters, but as the series progresses you’ll start seeing that there is more too them. That being said there really isn’t a massive amount of character development, especially for Black Rabbit and Izayoi. Those two characters are also the ones who we get the least amount of background information about.<br />
<br />
All of the characters are likeable and enjoyable to watch. The characters deferent personalities worked well together and made their interaction entertaining to watch. For example, Black Rabbit is easily flustered, and even though the You, Asuka, and Izayoi are taking on the huge responsibility of rebuilding an entire community, they are still problem children. The are constantly doing things that Black Rabbit doesn’t approve of, and that creates some very funny moments during the series.<br />
<br />
There are a decent amount of side characters in the series. For the most part, they are all given a decent amount of screen time, and at least a little background information.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed watching Problem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren’t They?. The story was interesting, the animation and sound were really well done, and the characters were very likeable and enjoyable to watch. I’m really hoping for a second season so that I can see how the story ends.<br />
<br />
Verdict and Breakdown:<br />
<br />
Story: 3.6/5<br />
<br />
Animation: 4/5<br />
<br />
Sound: 4.3/5<br />
<br />
Characters: 3.7/5<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 4.1/5<br />
<br />
Verdict: 3.9/5<br />
<br />
Problem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren’t They? is a very good series that will keep you entertained from beginning to end.

    Ok, when I see a &quot;PG13&quot; rating next to an anime, it is a clear indicator, to me, that it is childish and boring, save Fairy Tail, Dog Days, One Piece etc.<br />
<br />
The only reason i even considered this anime was: 1. I was bored <br />
 2. It had a dog days recommendation.<br />
<br />
But I was outstandingly surprised with what was presented, and I enjoyed this thoroughly and with a light heart.<br />
<br />
The Story: 8: This must have been modelled around dog days, people coming from an other world to participate in events and games (believe it or not, but war is a game in Dog Days.... who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review89931">
        knew...) and to bring strength back to a community that is in a tough spot. Really enjoyed it =D<br />
<br />
Art: 9: Very colourful and happy, with even the nights being light up with a shower of oranges, reds, yellows and other bright colours. It is a very light-hearted art style that was a very refreshing splash from usual<br />
<br />
But like all good thing this anime had its moments that were obviously made for the younger audiences with little or no over-the-top kind of fights or battles (wired, considering they are trying to defeat a demon...) that sort of makes fights seem less serious than they are<br />
<br />
In short is was very entertaining and enjoyable to watch, I loved it, and anybody who loves a good comedy and funny main, I suggest you watch this now!  <br />

    Have you ever wished life was one big game? Who am I kidding, we probably all have. For whatever reason, we wish life would lose at least some of its boredom. Maybe you find school to be naught but a chore. Maybe your job is tedious and your boss is a dick. For whatever reason, you find yourself trudging through life, unable to enjoy anything. Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo? Is an anime that explores what it would be like if the world were decided through games. Games of all sorts and varieties. You set up the rules, place your stakes, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review185356">
        play. Oooohhh, how I wish. They say that if you find a job you love, you&#039;ll never work a day in your life, and I feel this anime is one of the shining examples of that belief. <br />
I say that everything is decided through games, but that may be a bit misleading. Sure, there are a good number of literal games one can play. You want to challenge someone to pick a specific card from a deck, by all means, place your bets. But, if you want a contest of strength, where the victor is the one left alive, that&#039;s ok too. Everything in this world goes, you just have to establish the rules beforehand. <br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
I&#039;m going to be quite honest, I loved this story. But a bit of clarification in saying that- The idea of people getting transported to a foreign world to assist some underdogs in some sort of conflict is nothing new. But thanks to MAL&#039;s scoring system, I throw both the premise and the world under the category of story. This world was one that I found entirely original, and that&#039;s pretty rare these days. As you likely gathered from my preface, this is a world where everything is decided through games, “Gift Games” to be exact. The games have predetermined rules that cannot be broken, but they do not have to be completely clear for both parties involved. The games even have overseers to ensure the rules are followed. The gift aspect of that title arises from the tools participants utilize in the games. These gifts have a wide variety of possibilities, ranging from a super-power to a magic item. Did I mention that by the way? There is magic in this world. Rather, it is more accurate to say the world is magic. <br />
The world is named Little Garden. I don&#039;t know who chose this name, as it is pretty bloody far from the truth. The world is said to be roughly the size of the sun, which means it is roughly 100 times larger than the Earth&#039;s surface. Whoever decided to throw the adjective little into the name of that world certainly has an odd sense of humor. Many of the denizens of Little Garden are members of a community as it is recommended to be in one if you are to participate in a Gift Games. The communities are as they sound, a community of people. But I found that they were very comparable to a guild, like one may find in an MMO or watching Fairy Tail. A group of people who come together under a single banner to live on the same land, work together, be a team, be family, etc, etc. The specifics would vary depending upon the individual community. <br />
What I really liked about this world was the lack of a happy go lucky vibe. This world wasn&#039;t perfect, there existed slavery, kidnapping, blackmail, poverty, and death was a realistic consequence. It added an extra degree of immersion knowing that though they are called games, that was really just an illusionary pleasantry. These were high stakes contests with realistic consequences. <br />
With all of my praises, you may be wondering why it is only rated as an 8. The answer is due to the simple fact that so much of this world and its nuances remain unexplored. I have questions left about the specifics of this world, the Demon Lords and their powers, the No-Names that the story focuses on. We just aren&#039;t given enough information. <br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
The animation was very solid on the whole. The action scenes seemed fluid, I loved the scenery, a wide array of vibrant colors. I also was a big fan of the character designs, they were all memorable and an aspect I was a big fan of. <br />
I am also going to mention the ending theme in this section. Sure, &quot;To Be Continued?&quot; by Kaori Sadohara was a catchy little song, but the real reason I watched it so many times was the chibi art-style of the main characters dancing. It was just so much fun to watch, it never failed to bring a very large grin to my face. <br />
<br />
Sound: 7 <br />
There isn&#039;t a ton I can say. The OST was solid on the whole, but none of the tracks jumped out at me as being spectacular. <br />
The voice acting was pretty damn good. I have only seen the show subbed, so I cannot make any comments on the quality and/or accuracy of the dub, but the sub felt almost perfect. There wasn&#039;t a single voice I didn&#039;t find fitting, and to the opposite effect, I liked every single one. <br />
The OP was awesome. &quot;Black † White&quot; by Iori Nomizu was a very good song that quickly found its way into my musical library. The visuals were pretty good as well. <br />
<br />
Characters: 8<br />
I don&#039;t know why, but many anime throughout the years have habits of making the main characters fairly weak characters (in terms of their capabilities). Whether or not they remain weak is irrelevant, but weak characters are a very common trope. Maybe people just love the underdog story, maybe it is so the weak and timid viewer base can insert themselves into a given situation with relative ease. Whatever the reason, thank you for the breath of fresh air Tarō Tatsunoko (the author of the original light novels, I just looked it up). These characters are immediately established as being skilled. But having skill alone is not the recipe for a good character, I can point out a dozen gary stus that suck as characters. These characters all have their own bit of charm, and it makes them an extremely fun and memorable cast because of that. <br />
<br />
Izayoi Sakamaki- Here we the ultimate badass of this show. This guy has confidence and cockiness seeping from every pore in his body. Is that imagery a bit weird? Sorry for that, but it&#039;s accurate. He is an extremely capable fighter and he is quickly established as being intelligent as well. I&#039;ll be honest, he is a bit OP, but don&#039;t let that deter from thinking he is a good character. He isn&#039;t a perfect nice guy, he isn&#039;t the type to get involved in every one of his friends&#039; problems. He is a bit of a pervert, but not the over-the-top get a nosebleed kind, but a confident one who will compliment a girl and give a descriptive run down of her outfit and how it perfectly accentuates her curves. This guy honestly is just a pleasure to watch. <br />
<br />
Black Rabbit- The bunny girl who serves as the primary source of fan-service for your viewing pleasure. Ok, there is a bit more to her than that. She is a girl who brings the problem children into her community, and in a sense serves as their caretaker. Rather, that is what she is supposed to do. Quite frankly, she is outclassed. She tries to be oh so serious, but thanks to the eccentricities of the other characters, she often ends up in a flustered state. She is not incompetent, but she doesn&#039;t seem to shine as brightly as the problem children... * wink * <br />
<br />
Asuka Kudou- She is the rich girl character. She immediately displays this high class, haughty, arrogance that could only come from someone born into power and money. That is just her initial appearance however, and you see she is actually a fairly kind girl who is also highly intelligent and perceptive. Of the main cast, she receives the most (and best) development. <br />
<br />
You Kasukabe- Here we have the fairly quiet girl. Note, she is not a Rei Ayanami or Yuki Nagato, just a fairly quiet girl. I draw the distinction because I don&#039;t often see characters like her. She isn&#039;t shy or socially awkward, just quiet. But usually quiet characters are taken to the very extreme, but she strikes a nice balance. She is a nice girl with a good heart. Oh, and she can speak to animals. <br />
<br />
Granted, Asuka is the only character who benefits from any real degree of development. But despite that I still give these characters a score of 8 because they felt so individualistic and memorable. It is also their capabilities. Izayoi is most definitely the powerhouse of the show, but the other characters always have a role to play. Correction, it is a pivotal role that they play. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10 <br />
I use anime as a form of escapism, and this anime fulfills that to a tee. Magic, fighting, and all in game-like format. The characters were awesome, and their early escapades across this world created fun and exciting situations with a unique flare I have not seen demonstrated elsewhere. <br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
It&#039;s a high 8, but not quite deserving of a 9. This was an amazing world and concept with a very fun cast of characters. Its greatest downfall is ultimately the fact that it only received 10 episodes. The show thankfully didn&#039;t try and cram too much into this less than one cour time-frame, but it leaves a TON to be desired. <br />
The show is short enough that it feels just like a long movie, so it isn&#039;t even a massive time sink. This anime is most definitely worth a watch. Even if you don&#039;t latch onto the world or characters as much as I do, the whole show is just a big ball of fun.

    Tired of all your beta main characters? Well Mondaiji-tachi is one of those anime that has an awesome main character. It isn&#039;t like your typical fantasy adventure anime, but an action packed anime with good comedy. Prepare to join the world of &#039;Little Garden&#039;.<br />
<br />
Izayoi Sakamaki may be one of the bad ass character I&#039;ve seen. He isn&#039;t as beta as Ichika Orimura from Infinite Stratos. Before I go down explaining the characters, there are two type of main characters; alpha and beta. Alpha main characters would be one of the main character that viewers would like and would be a dominant person rather than backing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review100839">
        off in certain situations. Beta main characters are characters that are indecisive and doesn&#039;t know how to handle an event. The current anime trend tend to have beta main character as some may see them cute. Now Izayoi is one fine gentlemen that was able to deal with many situations which makes me enjoy the anime. It wasn&#039;t rage inducing because I didn&#039;t feel disappointed in his decision makings. The only anime that I can see has somebody that is similar to Izayoi is Kaze No Stigma. The other characters like Kurousagi, You Kasukabe and Asuka Kudou are very unique. Having the anime explain the backstory of where these children came from made me feel that I was able to connect with the characters. It is significant because they&#039;re all from different timelines and each one have their own problems. Thus, it makes the title: Problem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren&#039;t They?<br />
<br />
The plot was great. I was able to enjoy it because of the action. It may be cliche, but it followed the light novel. It was sad that the anime only became a 10 episode anime. There are more materials in the light novel. The adventures the children had was great. There are scenes that were funny. There are scenes that are serious for those who enjoy the plot. To sum it up, the plot is where the Kurousagi asked the children for help to save their squad in &#039;Little World&#039;. The children had to build the squad from the bottom after a drastic incident. There are many problems the children had to face in order to help Kurousagi.<br />
<br />
The music was great and enjoyable. The opening was well made. It is by Iori Nomizu and she tends to have a rock type music. It seems fitting because you want to have that bad ass feel when watching this anime. The ending was cute and I&#039;m sure those who watched this anime have felt that the ending was good too.<br />
<br />
Overall, I felt that this anime was airing at a wrong time (the winter season). Many people hated the winter season and this anime was what kept me through the winter season. I wanted to share this anime with more people that haven&#039;t seen it. It is great and if you like Sword Art Online or any of those fantasy adventures, Mondaiji-tachi would be one of your interest.
