    So I went to see the first show of opening day of the kancolle movie and I&#039;d like to share my impressions of it.<br />
<br />
now I&#039;ll try to be as spoiler free as possible but there may be some spoilers so be careful.<br />
<br />
So the movie takes place at the Iron Bottom Sound and Fubuki and the gang led by Nagato (Teitoku is somewhere else) have to investigate the strange crimson sea of the iron bottom sound. Basically it&#039;s the battles of Solomon.<br />
<br />
The movie also reveals secrets of the kanmusu and the abyssals and their relationship. They even show how drops work with the drop of a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review234534">
        certain kanmusu after a battle. The movie also shows why Fubuki is so important even though in actual history, she didn&#039;t really do anything great.<br />
<br />
The animation was great with many of the new Kanmusu (Chokai, Tenryuu, Kako, Furutaka, Kinugasa, Aoba) having good parts in the action. Ships that didn&#039;t have much time to shine in action during the anime like Yuudachi and Yamato each had some great action scenes as well. There is also more much less of the Cg and everyone moved like how you expected them to move. Compared to the anime the action is much more fluid with many awesome scenes.<br />
<br />
Many different Kanmusu have made cameos and if you listened carefully you could here them talking in the background in some scenes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now the story itself might be met with mixed reviews. I won&#039;t say anything about it but some people might not like certain events. The story is mainly quite serious with only bits of slice of life. I personally found the story to be quite interesting as it helped with concluding Fubuki&#039;s story.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall it was quite an enjoyable experience and I can safely recommend the movie to anyone who likes  Kancolle. I also recommend  people who didn&#039;t like the anime to watch this as it fixes a lot of problems the anime had. <br />

    Why does EVERY military-esque anime movie LA comes across always knows how to do anime movies correctly!..well to LA&#039;s standards anyways.<br />
<br />
Kantai Collection&#039;s anime series was iffy but not outright horrible for the most part, being either too unfocused with it&#039;s comedically overbloated slice of life episodes to being confused in terms of plot direction as well as it&#039;s CGI not up to snuff...however LA still liked Kantai Collection&#039;s anime series for two reasons.....Kongou and the anime&#039;s &quot;attempt&quot; in trying world building for a web browser game anime adaptation.<br />
<br />
So what&#039;s Kantai Collection&#039;s movie about?...after the events of the anime series, the Fleet Girls hear an eerie

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257045">
        voice in Ironbottom Island and within this island starts spreading corroding discolored waters, thus the Fleet Girls must figure out what or who and how to stop this, with Fubuki being mysteriously linked to all this.<br />
<br />
Kantai Collection&#039;s movie right from the offset ticked many of LA&#039;s boxes of how to do an anime movie correctly, from now upgraded and far more detailed animation to the mere fact that this movie makes callbacks to the anime that becomes one of the primary focus to this movie. Best yet is that the movie manages to redeem what world building the anime series did especially when concerning the odd &quot;hope&quot; or &quot;fate&quot; that appeared in the anime series as well as the Abyssal Vessels themselves are looked upon.<br />
<br />
Kantai Collection&#039;s movie character focus are towards three characters, Fubuki, Mutsuki and Kaga for the most part. Kaga&#039;s focus helps immensely with world building of this movie, Mutsuki helps with the emotional side of the movie especially when one character who we thought sunk in the anime series comes back and this brings in Mutsuki&#039;s emotional clutch to the movie. Fubuki helps with the goal-orientated plotline for this movie mainly to do with Ironbottom Island and the voice that keeps calling out to her. To be fair this format of having three simultaneous plotliines linked to three characters is good for plot progression. <br />
<br />
For the minor characters, they are essentially supporting characters and the MANY MANY characters have a chance to shine as well as bringing us tension if some of our favourite characters might sink or kicks Abyssal butt. LA&#039;s favourite character from Kantai Collection easily goes to Kongou (she&#039;s in LA&#039;s Favourite characters!) however she has a shorter screentime which LA gets, the movie is much more serious, plot focused and intense than the anime series so LA could see her screentime slimmed down, HOWEVER Yamato (LA&#039;s second favourite character in the series) got a bit more of the spotlight from this movie and her being badass so LA is completely ok with that.<br />
<br />
Kantai Collection&#039;s movie does imply something with it&#039;s Abyssal Vessel and Fleet Girls lore and the world building this movie implemented and by the finale of the movie goes full lotus eating machine on us. Nonetheless Kantai Collection&#039;s anime series hinted at this but the movie outright brings this up and makes an interesting notion of the Abyssal Vessels from the web browser games and just the notion of &quot;enemies&quot; in general have, the movie basically saying that the enemies we fight are not just a targets or points, they too have a goal not just as an enemy but as a &quot;character&quot; and they are more tragic characters than the &quot;evil enemies we have to fight just..because&quot; which is easily manifested in Fubuki&#039;s end goal &quot;villain&quot; though they leave this notion up in the air by the end of this movie however LA thinks that&#039;s the point, character-wise and sequel-wise.<br />
<br />
The animation once again done by diomedea as LA mentioned is definitely a step above from the anime series, from really detailed and consistent animation with diomedea finally doing many of the naval battle skirmishes beautifully and gloriously fluid and action-heavy, best yet is that the CGI is now integrated to it&#039;s traditional animation, though sometimes the CGI are shown at times but not as blatant as the anime series. Either way, LA can see that diomedea step up their game for this movie and it god damn shows.<br />
<br />
Now voice acting...Jesus who to start?...Yuka Iguchi as Kaga, Rina Hidaka as Mutsuki and Sumire Uesaka as Fubuki were great however here comes the most obvious MVP of Kantai Collection&#039;s movie...Ayane Sakura voicing SIX characters, they being Jintsuu, Mutsu, Nagato, Naka, Sendai and Shimakaze all with differing accents and voices. Though Ayane Sakura takes the easy MVP seiyuu for this movie, LA&#039;s favourite voice actor for this movie however would actually go to Rina Hidaka however if only because she goes into more of the emotional range her characters goes through helped. LA just wished Kongou had more screentime...then LA could had easily put Nao Touyama in LA&#039;s favourite voice actor in this movie.<br />
<br />
So yeah, if it isn&#039;t blindingly obvious, Kantai Collection&#039;s Movie is another breath of fresh air when it comes to anime movies for LA, having this movie tie back to the anime series as well as focus on plot points brought up from the anime series and give us an original story in the process, NO anime movie-only character schthick, no recapping wasting time instead this movie getting straight to the action and as such progressing the plot forward instead of being a one-off instance (with it&#039;s world building and character development) and the most obvious reason being that the movie outdid the anime series in many differing aspects from the plot to characters all under 90 minutes, all this is seriously how you get into LA&#039;s best standards in making an anime movie and Kantai Collection&#039;s movie succeeded impressively.<br />
<br />
If this is the plot and character direction the Kantai Collection media is going, then LA will be quite interested in how Kantai Collection Zoku-hen will lead to...<br />
<br />
Hopefully with more Kongou...

    Alright, honestly I just watched the movie since it just got released with English subs but I found the movie just needs more time. I will try to keep spoilers to as little as possible.<br />
<br />
Story 8/10 : I found the story to be pretty well written, although nothing out of the ordinary. Yes it&#039;s about what happened to Kisaragi but like my main thesis said, the movie was just so short falling in at an hour and thirty that it couldn&#039;t get all the details out.<br />
<br />
Art 8/10 : The art was pretty good for CG 2017. It&#039;s still similar to the anime version but just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256673">
        slightly improved, nothing much of a difference here.<br />
<br />
Characters 7/10 : The character&#039;s were memorable to me but this could be a different statement for someone else. We still have most of the same characters returning from the original anime in the movie. Although we have some additional characters starring such as Amatsukaze, Choukai, etc. I noticed though they got little screen time in the time the movie had. Not too much of a vast improvement here.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 8/10 : I really enjoyed this movie since it followed up from the anime pretty well. Some plot holes were covered up and we got to see new characters that people wanted to see. Could use improvement though.<br />
<br />
Overall 8/10 : I would most likely give this movie a 7/10 but the budget I heard wasn&#039;t too much so the people who had to do this did what they could which I can understand so I&#039;ll bump it up to an 8/10. Well done movie, but could use more length to it.<br />
<br />
TL;DR : Watch the movie if you enjoyed the series, plot holes fixed, continuation, although short.

I will start off with that I wasn&#039;t really into Kancolle main series since  the original source was a web base game. Note that I really like old time battle ships and tanks.<br />
<br />
After watching the movie, I will say it actually adds a lot of world building to a game that doesn&#039;t have a story. I can&#039;t really give details but give the movie a shot. You probably will like it. <br />
<br />
If I remember correctly the PV threw me onto the wrong path on how the story will play out.<br />
<br />
Bonus points for adding more cast like (Chokai,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314721">
        Tenryuu, Kako, Furutaka, Kinugasa, Aoba)  with parts that add to the action.<br />
<br />
Animation~<br />
There is  CGI but it was rendered where you probably won&#039;t notice it as much. And probably didn&#039;t think it was really CGI. The battles were more fluid with many awesomes scenes that I can re-watch again.

    This review assumes that you have indeed seen Kancolle the movie and while care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there may be spoilers within character analysis.  <br />
<br />
A battle to save a most cherished friend and comrade in a war that become clearer and more personal to the cutest warships ever seen. <br />
<br />
Military themed animes are perhaps one of the most common themes used in animes in this era and is one that Kancolle uses to good effect. Kancolle the movie based upon the popular browse game of the same name that was already adapted into an anime that preceded this movie.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review259244">
         A military, action anime with elements of drama and sci fi mixed in Kancolle the movie like the anime before takes place in a fictional version of the Pacific Ocean specifically in the area around the Solomon Islands an area well known as a battlefield both in this world and the real world and when combined with what the main characters represent especially relevant. <br />
<br />
The overall story for the movie follows a relatively large cast of various world war two era warships that had been recreated in this world as cute fleet girls and depicts the girls attempts to discover the truth about the war that they have been fighting for so long. Though the series features a great many characters the main characters here include Fubuki an earnest but determined young destroyer, Akagi a positive but wise carrier, Mutsuki a cheerful and upbeat destroyer. Together with their comrades these three ships would fight hard to protect the oceans from the abyssal ships and rescue a cherished friend as they discover the true nature of the war and the enemies that they have been fighting.  <br />
<br />
Fubuki <br />
<br />
Fubuki voiced by veteran seiyuu Sumire Uesaka of Hand Shakers fame is one of the main characters of the movie and is the main protagonist of the move. A positive, hardworking and honest girl Fubuki in both the movie and the preceding anime is a member of the destroyer class girls that are lightly armed with both light gun batteries and torpedoes. While still new to the role of a fleet girl Fubuki despite already having several kills to her name is a humble and kind-hearted person that is friendly to everyone that she meets which ensures that she’s popular within the fleet girls. While hardworking and friendly Fubuki’s most prominent trait is her determination not just to complete the missions that she has been assigned to but also to complete them while keeping her allies and friends safe so that they can finally end this war. <br />
<br />
Akagi <br />
<br />
Akagi voiced by veteran seiyuu Saki Fujita of Attack on Titan fame is one of the main characters of the movie. A veteran member of the Fleet girls and a member of the carrier class that has as their main role the launching of their embarked carrier air wings to both launch attacks and defend their fleets from attacks. A quiet, composed and cautious person by nature Akagi is someone that behaves very much like a big sister to her younger fleet girl subordinates always ready to listen to their problems and provide advice when needed. While quiet and composed Akagi’s most prominent trait is her approachability in that unlike the likes of Kaga who can be intimidating to talk to due to her stoic nature Akagi is someone that’s the complete opposite being friendly, warm and always ready to listen to what others have to say. <br />
<br />
Mutsuki <br />
<br />
Mutsuki voiced by veteran seiyuu Rina Hidaka of SAO fame is one of the main characters of the movie. A fellow destroyer and fleet girl of both Fubuki and Akagi Mutsuki is a cheerful, upbeat and positive young girl that emphasizes the innocence of the girls that are engaged in this fierce war perfectly. An honest and happy person Mutsuki is someone that values friendship, loyalty and duty seriously and will do her utmost to protect her friends and allies from danger while also taking the fight to the enemy. While a cheerful and typically go lucky person Mutsuki is shown to be very perceptive at seeing the feelings behind people and is often able to tell what they really are feeling. This ability to be able to understand someone’s true feelings and her willingness to stand with her friends plays a large part in the underlying plot for the movie something that I liked to see as it added a more emotional side to the story.  <br />
<br />
AMV (Animation, Music and Voice acting) <br />
The animation for the movie I felt was actually pretty strong especially with regards to the battle scenes not just between the girls and the enemy fleets but also with the aerial battles that took place between the carrier’s fighters and their enemy counterparts. Character design for the series I felt has always been excellent and in this movie, this was maintained. The character of Kisaragi and her gradual change as the story went on I felt was done really well as her outfits and character design gradually reflected the changes that she herself was going through. Music for the movie I felt was actually pretty strong with the scene music in particular being especially impressive. A common problem that animes that have large casts of characters have is that they usually don’t give enough screen time to them all. In this I felt that Kancolle did a smart thing by focusing on short but memorable scenes on certain characters so that each can get a moment to shine in the movie without wasting too much time with best examples being Yuudachi’s berserk fury against the enemy ships, Mutsuki’s determination to save her sister overriding her timid nature and Yamato’s chance to unleash her full broadside against an approaching enemy squadron. These individual moments I felt were well done and each showed a hint of the personalities that the girls had in addition to giving them a chance to shine. <br />
<br />
Overall conclusion <br />
<br />
Overall Kancolle the movie was a movie that I really enjoyed because it focused on its main strengths while also trying hard to get rid of the weaknesses that the anime itself had. In this I felt that it was relatively successful in both tasks. The main strong points for movie I felt was its premise, strong story, excellent characters and well-designed battle scenes.  The overall story for the movie which was also connected with the overall premise of the movie I felt was really strong and far more focused than what was seen in the anime before which actually was one of the main criticism’s that I had with it. The combination of the revelation of the true nature of the enemy faction that the girls have been fighting against for so long and the need to solve the central mystery of the story I felt was a great move as it ensured that the story while retaining a central objective as its main focus also included a certain element of emotional attachment to the story and to the girls as well. This was also reinforced by the character of Mutsuki and her bond with Kisaragi. In the end Kancolle the movie was a movie that I really enjoyed because it focused on its main strengths of friendship, unity and bonds and its application in combat and unlike the previous anime never lost sight of it. In terms of final score, I believe it more than warrants a 10 in my books as I loved the more focused story, the revelations about the enemy and slick but smart battles scenes which together with the emotional story between Mutsuki and Kisaragi really made it amazing in my eyes. The voice acting was also something that I was truly impressed with especially with regards to Rina Hidaka who ended up having dual roles here and showing her skills at voice acting have really improved substantially. <br />

    There is literally, ONE! review for this movie! ONE! ...well, two now. Let&#039;s get started. <br />
<br />
Kantai Collection -movie sequence- is a hour and a half long movie that should be watched after you watched the anime. Or played the games. Or both. Unless you&#039;re a big fan of KanColle, you probably won&#039;t be as attached to the movie as much as the guy beside me during the release over in Indonesia, but I digress.<br />
<br />
Here is a review from a person who knows about KanColle and has (tried to) play the games.<br />
<br />
Due to lack of synopsis, I shall add my own. It&#039;s really short though.<br />
<br />
==Synopsis/Story<br />
<br />
In the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review252348">
        middle of a sortie, a fleet finds a fleetgirl emerge from a Abyssal, followed by strange noises coming from the sea. Admiral is slacking off, so everyone else has to find out what that is. Also, the sea now has the debuff of &quot;Rust&quot;, gradually damaging all the KanColle girls who has the Fleet Girl title. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s really simple. You can consider it to be a OVA. Go buy the ticket to support the creators. They deserve it.<br />
<br />
==Art<br />
<br />
As expected of a movie-budget anime + literally one of the most popular web games in Japan, everything in this show is pretty. Very much so. The crying emotion on the faces of (one) cast was really well made. <br />
<br />
Also, as one who has watched (way) too many anime, I can tell you that the use of CG was really well done. You won&#039;t notice it unless you look for it (I did it subconsciosly, and it was using the same 3D filter as Soul Worker, so it&#039;s really good.)<br />
<br />
==Sound<br />
<br />
Nothing special. I didn&#039;t really notice anything about it. It suited the situation but didn&#039;t really do much to add to the experience.<br />
<br />
==Characters (Personal Rating: 7, Actual Rating: ???)<br />
<br />
Did you watch the anime? Any number you give to the characters from the anime should be the same amount for the movie, since no one really developed from the anime. But we did learn that one girl never really got over a death(capsized). That was really sad to see.<br />
<br />
==Enjoyment<br />
<br />
Personally, It was okay. I mean, it&#039;s cool to pass the time but nothing I would really recommend to anyone unless they&#039;re a huge fan of KanColle. I expressed interest in the franchise, but that only got me so far. If I was watching this at home, I would&#039;ve switched channels.<br />
<br />
==Overall<br />
<br />
It&#039;s fine. Go buy a ticket to support the creators. Who knows? You might like it as well.

    The original Kantai Collection anime was a mess, even to the point that the studio that created it admitted it was not their greatest work and that their sales did not meet the criteria they had hoped. I frankly did not have the movie on my priority despite being one of the biggest fans of the game thinking it would have been mundane as the anime. I am happy to say after watching it, the movie is good and an enjoyable watch for fans.<br />
<br />
Most of the faults of the anime in that it was slow, had inconsistent tones, a failure to advance a story/setting, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256988">
        a horrid use of CGI and lack of effort in battles is addressed in the movie. The plot and goal of the movie is addressed very early on in the film; the ocean water around Ironbottom Sound is starting to turn red and a mysterious voice centered around it indicates Abyssals will quickly destroyed life unless stopped. The first hour of the film does a fantastic job of developing the main characters and providing service with the addition of numerous fan-favorite characters from the game, all the while advancing the story and getting to the eventual battle sequence in a reasonable amount of time. <br />
<br />
The writers actually grew some balls for the movie. The relationship between the Kanmusus and Abyssals are established in the movie and the film puts in to cement certain fan theories. This is a huge step up from the anime where it seemed none of the writers wanted to place concrete lore in fear of fan reaction. <br />
<br />
The battle sequences are by far the most enjoyable parts of the movie. Rather than relying on that horrid CGI and lazily way the battles were drawn in the anime, all of the scenes are hand drawn and crafted in beautiful fashion. You actually see the girls dodging and zipping along the waters to avoid shots. You see the girls using searchlights in night battles to confirm targets and draw in fire for the other allies to move to safety. Because of how swift the battles look, it actually feels like there is a palpable danger to the fights. And there is a lovely dogfight between the fairy fighters and enemy planes.<br />
<br />
With all of that said there are of course certain faults to the movie. While it finally does create a plot and establishes lore/setting, most of it is pretty cliche and cheesy. The story sadly does not give any real interesting perspective or things to think about that have not been done many times already.<br />
<br />
 One of my big personal gripes was how much the film sucked off Fubuki. Despite doing very little in the movie and the film focusing more on Mutsuki&#039;s development, it still presents Fubuki as the most special girl of the entire fleet on the level of Madoka Kaname. It rather irks me that the petty girl who was jealous of Yuudachi getting a remodel and was moping around because she didn&#039;t participate in a few battles in the anime is apparently the biggest hero of the film. <br />
<br />
But it in the end the film was very crafted well. There should not be a single reason why a fan of the game would not at least enjoy parts of the movie. And yes, I compare the film to a lot to the anime. Because I know there are fans out there who hated the anime as I did and I want them to give the film a shot. If there ever is a season 2, hopefully the production quality (Probably not) is kept and the writers continue to establish the plot/lore without pitter pattering in fear of fan reaction.

    Hi, hello, greetings. The Kancolle Movie that was just recently released for wider audiences. Now, it should be noted I am a massive Kancolle fanboy, playing the game for almost 3 years, and knowing majority of the characters and backstories, I will try to keep a fresh unbiased perspective on this movie. And unlike my previous review of the series, I will structure this review differently, into what I liked and didn’t like, what worked and what didn’t. Without further ado, let’s dive into it. <br />
<br />
The Good<br />
<br />
Narrative Goal<br />
One of the problems I had with the anime was the lack of an overarching goal. The girls

          <span style="display: none;" id="review267424">
        would fight the Abyssals, but like why? Why are the Abyssals attacking and what is the end goal of all this? The movie fixes this problem by addressing who are the Abyssals. They pull some Puella Magi Madoka Magica stuff by giving the Abyssals a tragic origin story related to the ship girls themselves. Don’t want to give spoilers, but because of a clear and established goal, it gives us the audience a reason to cheer these girls on, albeit even if it is a vague reason. <br />
<br />
Fubuki<br />
Fubuki was one of my favorite characters from the show because she was one of the few that got any actual development and characterization. She grew into a competent ship girl, able to hold her own against an Abyssal and work well with a team. Fubuki in the movie had some interesting development as it ties into the origins of the Abyssals. It is a rather big plot point not only in the movie, but to the series as a whole. It works because it established Fubuki’s role in the story as this beacon of hope for all the ship girls and the goal at hand. This further develops Fubuki’s character as a whole, and I appreciate what they are doing with her character, even if it is grandiose in scheme.<br />
<br />
Mutsuki and Kisaragi’s Relationship<br />
Mutsuki was another favorite of mine as her development in the series opened up some sense of reality for the ship girls. She was rather fond of Kisaragi, so her “death” in the anime was extremely impactful. Kisaragi’s return was an extremely endearing scene. Just seeing these two interact gave excellent development to both Kisaragi and Mutsuki.<br />
Further into the movie, it is revealed that Kisaragi is actually an Abyssal, or is slowly starting to grow into one. This ordeal creates a challenge for both these characters as Kisaragi tries her best hide her secret while trying to be the role model for Mutsuki, and Mutsuki has to again slowly accept the reality they are living in and accept the fate that has befallen upon her. Moments like these really give characters some depth. <br />
<br />
Kaga’s Experience<br />
I don’t want to get too in-depth into this but I feel like this should still be highlighted. The situation Kisaragi is in is not the first to occur. Kaga has gone through a similar situation, becoming an Abyssal upon sinking as ship girl. However, being shot down as an Abyssal somehow revived her a ship girL. This plot point becomes really important to the goal of the movie as it ties into the grand scheme overall. Her experience not only gave some decent character development, it gave some nice interactions between Zuikaku, who at first was ignorant to the situation but later grew to understand what was going on, and the main three, Fubuki, Yuudachi, and Mutsuki. Although her time was brief, Kaga still played a relevant role to the movie as she did in the show. <br />
<br />
The Meh<br />
<br />
Animation and Art<br />
The art and animation style did not change much from the show. Each character is still drawn in a really unique and distinct way. However because of the time constraint, these characters unfortunately become background filler. The animation is nice and consistent, and although it isn’t flashy, it gets the job done.  <br />
The use of CGI in battles were a major problem in the show as the models didn’t match the art style the anime was going for. As a result, the transition between hand-drawn animation and CGI was incredibly jarring. On the bright side, CGI was really limited in the movie, resulting in a consistent production and viewing experience. <br />
The background art was nice overall as well, where instead of a naval academy, majority of the movie was set in a random island with some buildings here and there, almost like Truk island from episode 8 in the show. The nice lush green scenery really helps emphasize the bright color palettes of the characters. <br />
<br />
Unused or Pointless Characters<br />
As I said before, majority of the characters with unique designs end up as background filler. It is a shame too as a lot of the characters have really amazing designs that can tell a story on its own. As a fan of the franchise, seeing these girls animated will suffice for my enjoyment. However, I really would have loved to see more interactions amongst the different characters.<br />
Speaking of interactions, there are a few characters that stand out and end up getting some screen time. <br />
&lt;insert tokistukaze, amatsukaze, tenryuu, tatsuta&gt;<br />
Although brief, fan favorites Amatsukaze, Tokitsukaze, Tatsuta, and Tenryuu all have minor interactions with Fubuki and the gang. However, they feel out of place in the story because it begs the question “When were these girls ever introduced.” They kind of appear suddenly, in which a newcomer to the series will be really lost to their presence. In the end, they contribute nothing to the overall story, except for Tenryuu and Tatsuta mentioning the strange occurrences from the sea. And like usual, fan favorite Yuudachi really didn’t do much. These girls are most likely here for fanservice, which isn’t bad per se. <br />
<br />
The BAD<br />
<br />
The Pacing<br />
OH GOD the pacing in this movie is bad. The opening act showed a lot of promise, providing a nice battle sequence, Kisaragi’s rescue, setting the story overall. However, towards the middle act, the movie slows down a lot. While I did enjoy Mutsuki and Kisaragi’s developing relationship, the entire middle act is filled with uninteresting dialogue, tons of exposition, and twists the viewers could already see coming. The movie picks the pace up towards the third act, after the ship girls launch off into battle. While the third act was the more interesting parts of the movie, the entire middle portion of the movie slows down the movie a lot. The problem is that they tried to stretch out each scene as long as possible to fill in that movie time quota. As a result, the movie ends up suffering a bit due to the pacing. <br />
<br />
Cop-out ending <br />
While I do appreciate Diomedea giving the series an overarching narrative, this movie obviously serves as a bridge between season 1 and the upcoming season 2. The events of the movie takes place some time after the end of season 1. The transition feels smooth, but this movie can’t stand on its own without prior knowledge of season 1. Because of this, the movie needed to make up for the mistakes of season 1, which was the lack of a end goal. The movie not only had to set up what should have been established in the show, but also had to end in a way to transition into season 2 as well. Lots of series does this, so I have no major gripes with it.<br />
However, the ending really doesn’t conclude anything, as it obviously just builds more for season 2. Not to mention a deus ex machina after credits scene. I am sure fans of the character would be happy, but as a whole feel like one major cop-out. <br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
Overall, this movie is a step in the right direction for the series. It establishes more of the world and story that the show originally neglected. I am looking forward to where this series is heading. As a whole, the movie is a slight cut above the show, with some nice action sequences, limited CGI, some good character development for Fubuki and Mutsuki, and a much needed push for an overarching narrative. However, the entire middle portion is such a slog and slows down the movie as a whole. In the end, it is a decent movie that bridges season 1 and the future season 2. <br />

    I had a lot of fun with Kantai Collection, so I thought that watching this movie would be a good idea. So, was it any good? Well, let&#039;s hop on and find out, shall we?<br />
<br />
Warning! Spoiler alert!<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The movie sees the Fleet Girls fighting the Abyssals for control of a mysterious island, while Fubuki tries to understand the purpose behind the Fleet Girls&#039; existence. This story is surprisingly darker and more intense that that of the TV show, but it doesn&#039;t get any grittier and more violent. I&#039;ve never believed that a story becomes automatically better if it takes a darker and grittier route, but the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377870">
        movie does a good job at keeping the comedy to a minimum and focusing on the more serious and intense side of naval warfare.<br />
<br />
The dramatic tension and the emotional stakes reach an all-time high in this movie, as the Fleet Girls struggle to survive against impossible odds and doing their best to protect their own faith and hope in the darkest of times. In fact, hope can be considered the central theme in this movie. (7/10)<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
Fubuki, the protagonist, gets a pretty good character arc in this movie, as she struggles to hold on to her principles and have faith in her friends during the middle of a huge war. I also liked how the movie handled the relationship between Mutsuki and Kisaragi because it gives both characters so much pathos. You care about them and you feel for them and the situation they&#039;re in. (8/10)<br />
<br />
Art<br />
This movie is absolutely gorgeous to look at. Everything, from the character designs to the battles looks amazing. (8/10)<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
Enough praise cannot go to the epic soundtrack used for battles. At the same time, I really liked the performances of Sumire Uesaka (Fubuki), Rina Hidaka (Mutsuki and Kisaragi) and Nao Touyama (Kongou). (8/10)<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
If you enjoyed Kantai Collection, you&#039;ll definitely have fun watching this movie. It improves on the TV show&#039;s flaws and delivers an incredible experience. (8/10)
