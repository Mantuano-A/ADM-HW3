    This show works on so many levels it can whizz right past viewers heads because of its frenetic pace and glorious slapstick behaviour, but make no mistake there was plenty of thought put into the script of this 90&#039;s classic.<br />
<br />
Nadesico is a love letter to the space/mecha genre, both laughing at it and along with it with the same level of panache as Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.<br />
<br />
It parodies the genre with clichés, and honours it by keeping to them itself.  For example, Nadesico lampoons over the top sacrifices via its in-show 70’s/80&#039;s inspired mecha anime ‘Gekigangar 3’ then does the same thing itself anyway,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15735">
        revelling in the genre trope.  It has a young adult unwillingly thrust into a mecha on an almost daily basis, yet his mecha is pink for crying out loud.<br />
<br />
It’s actually a smart comedy because beyond the love for the mecha genre they&#039;re playing with, the writers are self-aware enough to acknowledge the details that a serious story would tackle, such as the (contractual) consequences of a corporation funding a military ship, funerals for the deceased, the effects of anime on viewers, and the different cultures of Earth, but never stopping the laughs along the way.  They even justify the sillier stuff in the show such as having such an airhead for a captain, by again satirising corporate tendencies. (the concept of tailor-made captains because of technology handling the rest of the ship)<br />
<br />
The backbone of this show, the factor that keeps it from descending into meaningless skit show histrionics is the attention to detail, on both a narrative level and thematic level.  It has the enthusiasm for sci-fi so much that it goes to lengths to explain many of its technologies using nano-machines, cyber-networking and boson particle manipulation and any number of concepts that any avid reader of hard sci-fi will automatically recognise.  Bear in mind this was released in the mid-90s before nano technology had hit the mainstream media as it has today, in the way it’s overridden nearly every mainstream sci-fi story as an explanation for fantastical stuff occurring on screen.<br />
<br />
On top of that, the show for the most part avoids one of my own little pet peeves, that of ships in space taking hits from lasers and not blowing up instantly, as if they were back on Earth and only got hit by a few stray bullets.  This little annoyance is avoided by the usage of actual force fields bouncing lasers off of the hulls.  The animators even show waves in the ocean peeling backwards as the Nadesico hovers above.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s this trivial, yet much welcomed, attention to detail that helps elevate the anime above mere comedy.  It&#039;s not just about making you laugh, but immersing you in its world with consistency and delivering a genuinely engaging story.  Rather than be a gimmick, the Gekigangar anime actually becomes more and more relevant to the main story in interesting ways that are better left unsaid in a review.<br />
<br />
The story flows between cliché and creativity every five minutes constantly surprising you.  Individuals who in no way belong on a ship are brought together anyway, characters who look like they&#039;ll be in main roles are dispatched speedily, enemy ships get progressively stronger, generic alien bad guys are revealed to be not so faceless or generic after all, a brilliant time-jumping Memento-esque episode that riffs on Evangelion&#039;s psychoanalytical finale in a humorous (yet always honourable) fashion also pops up, it’s just a complete mix.<br />
<br />
And every single character on the Nadesico gets some level of development, which is no mean feat considering the comedic nature of the show.  Even Nadesico&#039;s successor, TTGL, didn’t develop every character to any kind of level (Leeron for example), so when Nadesico goes out of its way to give a little detail to the past of a random pilot who you figure is only there to give bad puns, well you really appreciate it.<br />
<br />
The actual plot of Nadesico when you strip everything else away is actually pretty interesting, which is why the anime works, it’s built on a good foundation.  What starts as a generic ‘faceless aliens invading Earth’ story ends with the characters and viewer not wanting a victory for either side at all.  The Nadesico ship itself belongs to a corporation, hence justifying the motley crew of misfits and the airhead of a captain.  Because their superior technology is mostly automatic the captain was chosen for her looks, tailor-made for the crew&#039;s emotional wellbeing.  It’s crazy, it’s cynical, but you just know corporations could be that stupid to do such a thing one day, obsessed as they are with end results and not the methodology to get there.<br />
<br />
The mega corporation responsible for the Nadesico ship is also a brilliant way to force conflict and danger upon it, from both Earth&#039;s self-defence forces who don’t like the idea of corporations messing with military matters, and of course the invading aliens who don’t like the Nadesico for its pesky meddling.  This is much more interesting than having a generic plotline where a military ship goes &#039;rogue&#039; for the billionth time in a sci-fi tale. (ok, that happens later as well)  As the threats to Earth get larger, and more time passes, uneasy alliances are formed, love triangles are formed then imploded, revelations are uncovered, suppressed memories are, well, unsuppressed.<br />
<br />
The first three episodes are perfection, throwing you headfirst into its pitch-perfect comedic tones with hilarious stuff involving humour on both a physical and meta level.  The voice acting is oldschool 90&#039;s assured goodness.  Nadesico has some of the best and funniest ‘Engrish’ I&#039;ve ever heard in anime.  The soundtrack is also very decent; nothing too memorable except for the OP music, but the soundtrack isn’t too generic either.<br />
<br />
So as stated earlier, Nadesico shares much in common with TTGL for its skill in blending irreverent humour with its homage to a very popular genre of anime, but a key difference between the two is that TTGL is not afraid of leaping outside the box and tossing physics to the side to bring almost-abstract comedic imagery, whereas Nadesico is always weighed down by consistent logic whether in physics or narrative.  <br />
<br />
This is to say, no matter what crazy stuff happens in Nadesico, unlike in TTGL, there&#039;s always a reason behind it.  In TTGL Kamina&#039;s sword can stretch to infinity for no reason other than to make you laugh.  In Nadesico, for example, there’s a reason why only certain people can boson jump, it’s not used for convenience’s sake.  Nadesico is actually a better homage in that it uses meta-humour with the Gekigangar TV show, not for a gimmick but as part of the actual plot.  Nadesico is actually a decent analysis and commentary on anime.  The latter half of the show ups the drama and emotion, and pretty much blatantly celebrates the very medium itself with bold proclamations that are infectious.<br />
<br />
Nadesico is an essential anime for sci-fi/comedy fans.  Observe a young guy with suppressed memories get pushed around the solar system by a blue-haired witless captain of a White Base-ish ship blowing up insect-looking baddies while watching mecha anime in his spare time.  The ending is far from cliché, however much it will leave some viewers disgruntled for its unresolved story, the fact is that everything of importance in the narrative actually IS resolved; it’s a cliché-avoiding ending that doesn’t resort to what Gekigangar, the mirror of most mecha anime, does. <br />
<br />
It doesn’t force an ending on you with cheap happy shortcuts, Nadesico is better than this, going at its own assured pace always treating story and characters with respect.  If you’re the type that just has to have every single plot point wrapped up and a more ‘complete’ ending, then there is the subsequent Animage Grand Prix Award-winning movie Nadesico The Movie awaiting you, though the movie is a separate beast entirely, different in tone from the series.<br />
<br />
So there is only one Nadesico folks, one specific combination of humour, drama and space hijinks that hits the right spot each time.  “Gekiga In!”

    While there are mounds and mounds of great anime, there is also most certainly mounds and mounds of bad anime. In fact, the number in the &quot;bad&quot; category surely surpasses the amount in the &quot;good&quot; category. It&#039;s clear what my stand is on this anime by just looking at the rating which I have given it. However, the tough part is knocking the feelings when viewing this anime into a simple coherent review. Bear with me, as this is my very first review....ever. <br />
<br />
STORY - I guess I will start with the story, the fantastic story. The story is mostly a parody of more modern

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25533">
        mecha anime, which just so happens to include a parody of your typical 70s/80s mecha anime. Fans of every genre will find something to like within this series. Fans of harems, romance, action, mecha, comedy, parody, and drama will all find something to like here. It&#039;s simply a jack of all trades among anime. Truly one of the more diverse series. After the halfway mark, the story begins to answer questions found earlier in the series. The story takes a life of its own and is no longer just a simple parody, and several twists take place. Though the comedy fades slightly, I&#039;m willing to bet it will be near impossible for anyone to drop the series at this point as it still retains its delightful addictiveness. <br />
<br />
ART - Yes the art is from the mid to late 90s which may cause a problem for some people. It did for me as I&#039;m very much now used to the extravagant art of today&#039;s anime. There&#039;s nothing really wrong with it, it&#039;s just dated. I did notice some problems with Haruka Minato though. For some reason it just seemed like she was differently drawn than the other characters. Once you get by the fact that it&#039;s from the the mid to late 90s, you&#039;ll have no problem enjoying the art. Another thing to point out is how well the 70s/80s stereotypical mecha anime characters are included into a more modern mecha series.  <br />
<br />
SOUND - The opening theme, &quot;You Get to Burning&quot; is insanely catchy and will probably stick in your head for awhile. The ending theme, &quot;Watashi Rashiku&quot; is equally as good, and will probably follow suit, and stick in your head as well. The bgm is typical science fiction fare. It fits the setting, and none of the music is out of place, which is great, considering the diversity of this series.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER - One of the best features of this show. You get great diversity within the cast. The tomboyish girl, the moe girl, the ditz, the justice loving guy, the &quot;afraid to fight&quot; guy, etc...etc. The best part is how wacky the crew is, yet they are all extremely qualified for their positions. You&#039;ll see what I mean when you first see Yurika. The relationships between characters are also really well done. You&#039;ll feel sorry for some, while hating several others. In my opinion that equates to a great series. To fully appreciate the cast, if it weren&#039;t obvious enough, the series must be watched in full. Also, I feel it&#039;s near impossible to not fall in love with Ruri, you&#039;ll see what I mean. <br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT - The series is highly addictive and very entertaining. When you&#039;re not laughing, you could be feeling one of many emotions guaranteed while watching this show. It has its dramatic moments, but you&#039;ll be mostly laughing throughout the series. It&#039;s a great anime, and I feel it would be very hard to not appreciate at least a little. <br />
<br />
OVERALL - I make it my goal to watch a series that usually places among those considered the best in anime, and though I just finished this series, I have to say it is one of the best I&#039;ve ever seen. It was highly addictive and hilarious. It had great characters, and a decent plot. Oh and did I mention it was hilarious? One of the best features is the diversity of genres within Martian Successor Nadesico. There is literally something there for fans of nearly any genre to appreciate (except for horror). I would certainly make it in my best interest to view this series as soon as possible. <br />
<br />

    I consider myself relatively new to the mecha anime genre, with my main exposure to it being in the form of Evangelion, Gundam, and a little bit of Macross. So when I heard about Nadesico and its parodies, I figured that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t hurt to give it a go. To be honest, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve laughed more throughout any other series.<br />
<br />
Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a seasoned veteran or new to mecha anime, Nadesico doesn&amp;rsquo;t fail in its quest to poke fun at its ancestry and let you know about it. It&amp;rsquo;s rather fun to watch the show and point out the parody moments in each episode.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4635">
        It even contains a parody within a parody in the form of Gekigangar 3, a spoof of the mecha anime of the late 70s and 80s. Don&amp;rsquo;t think that parodies are the only things that will make you laugh. There are many points where the crew takes over and keeps the laughs coming with their daily interactions.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but fall in love with the crew of the Nadesico. Each crew member is unique and memorable in his or her own way. The entire spectrum is there: the otaku, the diva, the quiet one, the pervert, etc. It&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to not find one character that you can relate to in one form or another. The seiyuu do an equally great job at fleshing out their respective characters. Houkou Kuwashima (InuYasha&amp;rsquo;s Sango, Azumanga Daioh!&amp;rsquo;s Kagura) does a wonderful job as Yurika, switching from heartfelt to hyper with ease.<br />
<br />
As the series cruises along the half-way mark, the focus changes. The rampant parodies are taken back a bit, and a solid plot emerges. There are several psycho-analytic moments that blatantly poke fun at Evangelion, but I just didn&amp;rsquo;t find myself laughing as often as before. As everything hit the fan and the end began to come in sight, I was waiting for the epic conclusion that I had planned out in my mind. What I saw was nothing close to my hopes. Rather, Nadesico simply ended.<br />
<br />
The ending left me with mixed feelings, and it will most likely be seen as a love it or hate it ending among others. On one side, there are numerous plot holes that are left wide open, and several events are left unexplained. To put it simply, under most circumstances, I would see such an ending as a failure. However, I found it to be fitting finale for such a quirky series. There didn&#039;t need to be a perfect ending. I was able to leave the Nadesico with a smile on my face and a satisfied feeling, and that&amp;rsquo;s what matters.<br />
<br />
Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a fan of mecha anime or not, I still highly recommend this anime as an enjoyable comedy. Sometimes, you just have to take some time to laugh at yourself, and Nadesico does just that.

<br />
There were times as I watched Martian Successor Nadesico when I honestly began to wonder if I was having some elaborate prank pulled on me. The space opera genre has always been somewhat of a trophy for the anime medium, no other medium seems to do it justice; I mean Starblazers, come on! A classic in every way. But here was this obscure anime from 1996 practically yelling at me during its first dozen episodes: &quot;why the hell do you like anime? If all of this stuff: grandiose spaceships, a crew of highly trained teenagers that are respective prodigies in their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195890">
        fields, and a war across the stars against a vague, menacing and evil alien threat, were actually real... it would f*cking suck.&quot;<br />
<br />
     And it was odd, because as the episodes dragged on towards the inevitable finale, I honestly couldn&#039;t decide if I was watching some sort of meta-critique of war, the space opera genre, or maybe even anime in general ... or one gigantic celebration of it. And when it was over, I needed to close my laptop, lean back in my comfy chair, and sip on some cranberry juice for awhile, and do some thinking. Undoubtedly, all the commonalities of the genre were present in Nadesico, but they all seemed mutated into a form that I couldn&#039;t comprehend, at least on a level I was used to in anime. But some weeks after the fact, I think I finally have a concrete answer of what Martian Successor Nadesico is, or, at the very least, what it was trying to be.<br />
<br />
     Hello people of &quot;The Wired&quot;, my name is Quan, I hope you&#039;re having a positively spiffing day, and welcome, one and all, to a brand new anime review. Today, we take a look at the somewhat forgotten 1996 anime: Martian Successor Nadesico, and try to figure out what the hell it is. So, in other words, buckle up ladies and otakus, there&#039;s a lot to talk about. Now then, let&#039;s get started.<br />
<br />
But before I can get to things such as the plot and the characters, we need to go over some technical jibble-jablle. Nadesico was animated by studio Xebec, quite the veteran studio who have produced many different anime over the years(though actually, Nadesico was their second ever work), though I can&#039;t say I&#039;ve seen much things from them and have been impressed. To wind them down to highlights however, they are most prominently known for their work on MM, To-LOVE-Ru, Love Hina, and of course, Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2199.<br />
<br />
     The director was Tatsuo Satou, who I can&#039;t say has done anything else I particularly care about, but you may know him from his work on Shigofumi and Uchuu no Stellvia. The writing was divided between three people: Hiroyuki Kawasaki, Naruhisa Arakawa and Shou Aikawa. Since neither of us don&#039;t want to be here all day, I&#039;ll give you an idea for what these three have done over the years, gifting us the scripts for anime such as The Irresponsible Captain Tylor, Jinsei, Eureka Seven AO and Fullmetal Alchemist(2003). Finally, the anime is 26 episodes long, and ran from September 30th 1996 to March 24th 1997.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
Akito Tenkawa has never really wanted to fight. He was born on Mars in the midst of the brutal war between the united forces of Earth and the despicable Jovian lizards, a mysterious alien race seemingly intent on completely annihilating the human race, but after the traumatic childhood event of seeing his parents and friends slaughtered before his eyes, he has lost any desire to ever put himself onto the battlefield again. Rather, Akito follows his dream of being a cook, at least until his normal life is interrupted by the sudden reappearance of his old childhood friend on Mars(at least until she was transferred back to Earth by her father): Yurika. Yurika, as it turns out, is the captain of the Nadesico: a new private space-battleship that is possibly humanity&#039;s last hope of taking back Mars after its destruction by the Jovian lizards, and maybe, also of avoiding extinction. The last thing Akito wants to do is board the Nadesico, especially since because he has the special nanite implant that makes him one of few people able to pilot mechas, but on the other hand, enlisting on the Nadesico may be the only way to answer some of the many mysteries of his childhood. For instance, what was the real reason his parents were killed? Or, maybe even more important, why, as Akito was about to be slaughtered along with the rest of the population of Mars, was he instantly transported to Earth with absolutely no explanation? Yeah, that&#039;s also probably important.<br />
<br />
     But things on the Nadesico aren&#039;t exactly as Akito imagined. The majority of the crew, though experts in their respective fields, are misfits of society by any definition: otakus, ditzes and general weirdos. The mecha pilot: Gai Daigoji is a full-grown man completely obsessed with the anime Gekiganger 3, a mecha anime that Akito also watched while growing up on Mars. The smartest person on the entire ship is a 12 year old girl named Ruri, and the captain and Akito&#039;s childhood friend Yurika seems determined to marry Akito by any means possible... for some reason.<br />
<br />
    But as this eccentric crew bravely sails into the unknown battlefield of space with the hopes of all of mankind on their shoulders, it quickly becomes apparent that things aren&#039;t going to go exactly as planned, as the truths about the real nature of the Nadesico&#039;s purpose and the entire war are revealed. In an ever darkening limbo of vile secrets and conspiracies, Akito must gather all of his strength and will to push forward, and believe that even in a world that is far cry from the giant robot anime he loved while growing up, somehow, a happy ending is possible.<br />
<br />
Now, let me lay something on you that may be sort of unexpected. I don&#039;t know what you&#039;ve gathered the tone of the anime is like from that hefty description I just gave, but I can almost guarantee you&#039;re wrong, because despite Martian Successor Nadesico having the premise that it does, it&#039;s actually... a comedy. Yeah... a comedy, or to be more specific, more of a parody of these type of shows in general(at least at first). And it&#039;s actually pretty damn funny.<br />
<br />
     I watched the dub, as you should too, because the character chemistry between the crew of the Nadesico is pretty amazing to behold. Characters(especially Ruri), are pointing just how stupid the situation is, and the show does its best to parody most of space-opera&#039;s genre&#039;s tropes, to great effect, as the crew blunder their way through every threat the Jovian lizards lay in their path. It mocks such tropes as the obsessed childhood best friend, the overprotective father, and many more, making the first few episodes or so of the anime feel light, like a party of fun that everyone is invited to. Decent action is also inherent with the mecha battles, which is even more impressive because, remember, this is 1996. Serious moments will fall very unexpectedly occasionally, and could be seen as tonally incoherent, but as I see it, Nadesico was just foreshadowing what it would eventually become. Because, after all, the fun can only last so long.<br />
<br />
Beneath this comedic aspect, well, I wouldn&#039;t say there&#039;s a malicious edge, but as the anime goes on and the plot begins to come into view, harsh realism starts creeping in between the cracks of light comedy. It&#039;s an interesting mixture, to say the least, and probably won&#039;t be everybody&#039;s cup of tea, especially as the line between comedy and tragedy starts swaying uncontrollably as the plot continues its merry path, making the result sort of fascinating. Hell, for about half the show, I was nearly convinced that Nadesico was a full-blown deconstruction of the space opera genre, as the narrative starts to ask tougher and tougher questions that most other anime simply wouldn&#039;t. Would any kind of government bet the existence of all mankind on one single ship? Is negotiable peace after decades of war even possible? And lastly, would a ship mostly consisting of teenagers, eccentrics and people like Akito, really be able to save anyone at the end of the day, really? The answer to all of these questions... is a definitive &quot;no&quot;.<br />
<br />
     This is where the greatest weakness of Nadesico&#039;s plot comes into focus however, as it can&#039;t seem to decide which stance it wants to take. It&#039;s not a harsh deconstruction of the space opera genre, because for all the serious moments and cliches it rips apart, the comedic tone is too overbearing for that along with the huge amount of cliches that do find their way into the story unaddressed. It&#039;s definitely not a straight comedy though, and it doesn&#039;t seem too keen on celebrating the genre in general. What you get in the end is a mixture of extremely interesting elements, all of them deluded by how overcrowded it is. Nadesico would have done itself a favor by just playing its cards straight, because while this mixture undoubtedly makes a very good and intriguing anime, it may have been able to accomplish more by simply going one route.<br />
<br />
     As for the plot itself though, when taken at face level and not trying to decipher whether it was trying to be a deconstruction, or a celebration or whatever, it remains the anime&#039;s strongest element. What I appreciate most about it is how it takes its time; Nadesico uses every single one of its 26 episodes to build either the world or build the themes, leading to what I would say is a near perfect blend of episodes focusing on the world, focusing on the characters, or revealing something huge that takes the plot in an entirely new direction. Sure, while you&#039;re watching Nadesico, it can admittedly seem a little aimless at times, but make no mistake, nearly everything plays a part in the narrative later, one way, or another. For such an excellent build-up, the ending isn&#039;t... great per say, leaving a lot of things out in the open, but it&#039;s far from bad. It&#039;s just not quite what I was looking for, as for all the playing around Nadesico did with deconstructions and whatnot, it doesn&#039;t really go for any of that in the end; playing the last episode more or less straight, like it was from any typical space-opera. And... I just wasn&#039;t completely satisfied with that.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I don&#039;t want to spoil too much, but I would like to touch briefly on the &quot;anime within the anime&quot; Gekiganger 3, which is one of, if not the most important plot point in the entire show(which is why I&#039;ve made a point to mention before now). I won&#039;t tell you why this is, but just know that if you want to fully appreciate just how much thematic density Nadesico has, it&#039;s something to keep in mind, though admittedly, during the last couple episodes, that probably won&#039;t be that hard to do. The anime is not exactly subtle about it.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
Characters is where the anime takes its biggest hit. Now, as expected of a space-opera, the cast is extremely large, but this also means that while some characters get ample amounts of development, others are basically ignored. It also seems a little arbitrary who gets this treatment; for example, Ruri is given an entire few episodes to herself, episodes which provide possibly one of the most heart-breaking back-stories I&#039;ve come across for a great long while. On the other hand, Yurika, who remember, is the main love interest, gets almost nothing in the entirety of 26 episodes, which is a little odd for me. Ultimately, Nadesico is probably a little below average when it comes to characters. Obviously, there&#039;s way too many to fully develop the entire cast, but if at the end of 26 episodes only 4 or 5 of them have any real depth to them... that&#039;s a problem. Of course, I can&#039;t go over those lucky few here, it would take way too much time; but I will spare a moment to talk about our main character.<br />
<br />
     I wouldn&#039;t classify Akito as a particularly great character, but he&#039;s not bad for what he is. He has depth, and has a congruent arc that stretches throughout the duration of the anime, but he&#039;s annoying hesitant to development. We get to see him grow from a timid and mentally unstable boy into someone ready to fight for what he loves, but the development is extremely choppy, a &quot;two steps forward, one step back&quot; kind of thing. Obviously, to avoid spoilers I can&#039;t give details, but often I couldn&#039;t quite tell if he was actually growing from the experience or not, as he kept falling into the same habits he had shown at the beginning of the show. I guess what I&#039;m trying to say is that while Akito undoubtedly develops through the 26 episodes, it seems to fluctuate, and is hard to track mentality and the such. It&#039;s a little bit sloppy, not really strung to together strongly, but the bonds are there, enough to carry his character from the beginning to the end. I suppose, that&#039;s all I should really ask for.<br />
<br />
Presentation &amp; Sound<br />
<br />
Now, the simple truth is that some people may not be able to look past this part. Nadesico was animated in 1996, and looks pretty mediocre compared to the stuff coming out right now; that&#039;s not Xebec&#039;s fault, but that&#039;s the way it is. However, I&#039;d like to say that actually, when compared to things of its time, Nadesico looks pretty good. I remember watching Trigun(that came out only a year later than Nadesico) a while ago, and being struck by just how bad the animation was, and yeah, I know that&#039;s just me being a prick and not understanding the times, but with Nadesico, I never had that problem. The animation is fluid, and the fight scenes engaging, and while colors are dull, the obvious skill and effort that went into drawing this thing more than makes up for whatever bias you have against anime produced before 20XX.<br />
 <br />
     The same can sadly not be said for music. The OST was composed by Takayuki Hattori, who literally has done absolutely nothing I give any amount of craps about, though I have it from a good source that his music in other works has been quite good. All I can judge him for now currently is Nadesico&#039;s OST, which while is definitely far from average, isn&#039;t exactly something I&#039;d recommended listening to on your own. There&#039;s definitely a couple of fun songs that aren&#039;t your typical slice-of-life jingles however, the track &quot;Schiaparelli Project&quot; is quite excellent, and there&#039;s a orchestra cover of the opening that is pretty awesome. Speaking of the opening &quot;You Get To Burning&quot;, is probably the best the anime has to offer music wise, being exciting, catchy, and even really memorable, worthy of any classic space opera anime you could think of.<br />
<br />
Verdict<br />
<br />
Needless to say, Martian Successor Nadesico is one of the oddest anime I&#039;ve ever come across. An intriguing mixture of juxtaposing elements, it ultimately forms one of the most under-appreciated anime I&#039;ve ever seen, and of course, I&#039;ll end this review with a recommendation to watch the hell out of it, and while you&#039;re at it, spread the word to anyone else you think may enjoy it. But with all of that comes an air of disappointment when it&#039;s all over, because though Nadesico was unique, it ultimately chose to be normal in the end. And of course, there&#039;s nothing wrong with being normal, normality defines the rules that the media of this world, giving us boundaries to both obey and push, but for an anime to fall into the damp musk of it... a little disappointing in the end. And though it wasn&#039;t what I wanted it to be in the end, Nadesico is such a concoction of comedy, drama and bombastic passion that I must say, I would be shocked if anybody could walk away after episode 26 without finding at least a little something to love about the crew of the Nadesico. Maybe that says something. Despite how &quot;out there&quot; Nadesico can seem at times, still managing to use its charm and wit to appeal to nearly everyone; that seems to be an accomplishment if anything. And in the end, regardless if it&#039;s being a comedy, or a drama, or a romance, or an action series, or a deconstruction, or a celebration, or a straight-faced retread of a genre through references to its unique culture, there was one thing Nadesico never stopped being. And that... is good.<br />
<br />
Final Verdict: 7.5/10<br />

    I would call this my first anime. Now I did see Pokemon, Digimon, Yugioh, Sailor Moon and maybe some other air to tv series that I&#039;m forgetting, but this was the first introduced to me as anime. Now that I got that preface out of the way this has been my favorite anime since I first saw it, nearly ten years since it aired. <br />
Story has the reluctant hero finds his way, classic heroes journey. Add mechs, unmanned drones and a level of awareness to tap on that 4th wall, and you have the anime that I have come back to time and time again.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review400663">
        The music has been so ingrained in my head that I often play it for my own bgm at work or doing chores. The music well conveys the intended feeling the scenes try to invoke.<br />
I always try to push this anime because I really love it and feel that others can find this really enjoyable. Please if you&#039;re on the fence watch three episodes you won&#039;t be dissapointed.

    I heard rumours that this was once voted by Japanese viewers as the best anime ever.<br />
<br />
Why????<br />
<br />
&quot;Martian Successor Nadesico&quot; follows the crew of a battleship named, er, Nadesico, as they travel through space while battling alien forces. Having watched this show, it&#039;s quite clear that it&#039;s the inspiration behind &quot;Vandread&quot; - you can see that just from the strikingly similar character design styles with their ultra round eyes . &quot;Martian Successor Nadesico&quot; itself also seems to be derived from &quot;Super Dimensional Fortress Macross&quot;. Perhaps it&#039;s trying to parody that classic anime, but it&#039;s hard to tell, since I don&#039;t find &quot;Martian Successor Nadesico&quot; to be very

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31454">
        funny despite its best attempts at comedy. The comedy is the kind that I loath. Occasionally, some parts did made me laugh, and most of these involve the anime&#039;s parody of old, cheesey mecha anime from the 70&#039;s and 80&#039;s. I remember one scene in particular where a bunch of guys are scrutinising one such anime called &quot;Gekiganger 3&quot;, and one of them made a side-splittingly funny comment on the fact that the pilots are constantly shouting out the moves they use. Man... what a classic line that is, so I won&#039;t spoil it for you here :P Other than its piss taking of old mecha anime, most of the rest of the comedy is pretty rubbish. Most of the jokes fail miserably, and in fact sometimes I didn&#039;t even realise that a joke has been attempted till a few moments afterwards because the punchlines are so understated.<br />
<br />
The production of &quot;Martian Successor Nadesico&quot; is not great. It has such a strong outdated early nineties/ late eighties feel to it that I couldn&#039;t believe my eyes when I read that it&#039;s a show from 1996. The animation looks old-ish, the audio is a bit on the quiet side and sounds slightly muffled most of the time, causing the voice acting to sound flat. The worst thing though, is that everything seems to happen in such a casual manner, and there is no emphasis on key events when they occur, resulting in most of them flying straight past me without me noticing. The story feels like it has a lot going on, but I found it difficult to follow, partly due to the aforementioned under-emphasis on important moments, and partly because I found things were often moving too fast for me to pick up what was going on. It&#039;s a good example how NOT to build up and execute twists in the plot. All of this adds up to a rather lacklustre, detached viewing experience for me, as though I&#039;m watching it from afar and not really feeling engaged with the anime.<br />
<br />
I sense the characters has some substance, but the constant slap stick comedy makes it hard to tell, since you need to cut through such a thick layer of crap just to get a better idea. And in Ruri they have another one of those stereotypical anime girl with a deadpan voice that usually bugs the hell out of me. But wait! This one actually has a reason for being the way she is, and so I&#039;ll overlook this small annoyance in the her case. In fact, the episode uncovering Ruri&#039;s past is arguably one of the finest in the series.<br />
<br />
On the whole, I found &quot;Martian Successor Nadesico&quot; to be a laborious task to watch. The whole thing feels dull and amateurishly put together, and even though the last few episodes are relatively exciting (key word there being &quot;relatively), the plot is even more difficult to follow in those episodes. If this series is more exciting, like &quot;Last Exile&quot;, then I might be more motivated to try and work out the story, but in the case of this &quot;Martian Successor Nadesico&quot;, that just feels like a waste of time - why try and work out something you don&#039;t particularly care about? At the end of the day, it probably says a lot that I rather have watched that &quot;Gekiganger 3&quot; anime that the crew of Nadesico was watching than &quot;Martian Successor Nadesico&quot; itself - at least the former looks like it&#039;s rather entertaining, and it reminds me of the likes of &quot;Getter Robo&quot; which I used to love when I was young. As for &quot;Martian Successor Nadesico&quot;, I&#039;d have to be tortured before I&#039;d watch it again... in fact watching it itself can be considered a torturous activity.<br />

    Nadesico is an amazing gem that is often overlooked because of its mix of genres. While it has mechs, it&#039;s not necessarily a mech show. While it&#039;s sci fi, it doesn&#039;t officially focus on the universe.<br />
<br />
I frame it like this: Nadesico is the show to get people into anime if they can&#039;t get into Gundam or Evangelion. The characters are the focus of the show, with even the ship itself having a personality through it&#039;s AI, Omoikane. Coming out to the US market after both Gundam Wing and Evangelion, it was often overlooked, especially since it was never aired on television in the west. The

        comedy still cracks me up, the sad moments still hit their cue as well. While it has some small flaws, it&#039;s still one of my favorite shows that I return to yearly.

    Even though the intention of this anime is meant to be a satire on mech, in a way, it has its own distinctive story that you can easily follow, and is very intriguing with its conspiracies, which for some reasons, you can take seriously. I credit the show for being more character driven which has mostly been the nature of the mech genre, and though the characters are meant to parody of archetypes and standards, they are still likeable and distinguishable. Though the main cast such as Akito, Yurika, and Gai are air headed and stupid, they are still good natured and passionate which are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review8580">
        portrayed in a way where you can like them. Especially Gai. You just have to watch the show to see what he&amp;rsquo;s all about. He&amp;rsquo;s the heart and soul of the show. With the female characters you got the tomboy with a soft spot for Akito, the childish and energetic Hikaru, the side dish Megumi and many others that have their own contributions to it. But back to the story, the best thing about it is also somewhat its worst quality at the same time, and that the story has unpredictability and has its use of plot twists and resolutions. Though they may come out of nowhere and strike you, they can be anti-climatic at times, especially the ending. <br />
<br />
<br />
Being a parody of the mech genre, the mechanical designs of course are taking influence from other mech series. Such as the title Nadesico battleship is based on the White Base or the Pegasus class ship from the Gundam series. While the Aestavalis, the mechs in the series tend to have a Gundam esque design to it in relation to frame, but has an Evangelion and Virtual On edge with the color scheme. The engineering is also unique such as you can inter-change the cockpits of the mechs which is demonstrated early in the series and sets up really intense and hilarious action sequences. The fights are really engaging in their own rights themselves. Gai with his &amp;ldquo;blue prints&amp;rdquo; was like the coolest thing I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen, which you can see for yourself. Also, there is no use of lasers in the fights so you have use of more traditional war fare projectiles meaning missiles and bullets. Sorry, no lasers. Also features they have are that they can punch their hands out like rockets in relation to old school mech, and they can generate force fields which intensify their punching attacks sometimes so it adds more elements than just traditional military mech to it.<br />
<br />
The character design also perfectly reflects the intended nature of this show. Daigouji Gai with his side burns and long hair represents the main characters from the 1970s super hero mech shows, Yurika is meant to be a homage to Linn Minmay from Macross, and Ruri is of course a nod to Quess Paraya from Char&amp;rsquo;s Counterattack. Even though the designs are basic, the costume designs and the use of colors and resolution makes it look more cool and complex. <br />
<br />
The music is very intense and knows how to set the mood whether comedic, dramatic, or energetic. It has impact. The opening theme, You Get to Burning really makes you feel like you&amp;rsquo;re watching a true legitimate mech anime rather than a comedy. The lyrics itself is more about giving it your all and being with the one you love. The ending theme, Watashi Rashiku sung by Yurika&amp;rsquo;s voice actress, Kuwashima Houko tends to be very cutesy, and centered more on her character. It has a Girl&amp;rsquo;s Just Wanna Have Fun kind of feel to it. Other songs featured is Ruri&amp;rsquo;s single, Watashi no Ichiban ni Naritai. It gives her character more personality. And during a Christmas episode, they make their own Christmas song. The music overall is very outstanding and the regular background music also sets the atmosphere that it really creates your reactions.<br />
<br />
I have to say the Japanese version of Gai is just awesome who is played by Tomokazu Seki. He uses the voice he used as Domon Kashhun from G Gundam but makes him sound more funny and I believe plays homage to that character in that form. Akito played by Ueda Yuji is also pretty cool. The way he makes his character react negatively to situations makes him very funny and can make him sound serious when he reflects on his situations. Kuwashima Houko does a great job as Yurika. She can make the character sound air headed, or serious or sad. There is one early episode in the Japanese version where they speak English and it&amp;rsquo;s so hilarious. As usual, it&amp;rsquo;s very rare for me to dislike or badly criticize the Japanese acting because of how multi-talented some of the featured actors like like Tomokazu Seki.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I haven&amp;rsquo;t really seen the dub which I have no intentions of seeing. To me, I just don&amp;rsquo;t think this anime can work in English in the way this anime is intended to be because in the English speaking world of anime, there really is no base or approach on how the characters should be portrayed. <br />
<br />
If you make the choice to watch Nadesico, than you got something that has action, comedy, some romance, and a bit of everything except sex and nudity and extreme violence. You got a story that advances and will take you by surprise. However there is a movie sequel, but I personally didn&amp;rsquo;t like it because it&amp;rsquo;s not as fun as the series. Plus, you have to play some Saturn game to understand the plot. I believe this anime appeals more to casual audiences than Gundam, Evangelion, or Macross can because of the comedy and has minimal harem qualities that are more prevalent in Tenchi and Love Hina though it does not have the same amount of fan service. Despite that, it&amp;rsquo;s still something different because of how this anime approaches itself by being satire and something serious at the same time.

    Nadesico is like a coin. Simply put, its got 2 sides. Nadesico is known as a parody/tribute to mecha anime such as neon genesis (Nergal/Nerve...DUH) and etc... But its also got a much more serious side, showing the way of war, and that life isn&#039;t always a giant robot show. That being said, i would like to make clear that this is one of the best shows i have ever had the pleasure of seeing. <br />
       The story and its plot devices aren&#039;t the best ever, in fact they have probably all been done before. Usually, i would say

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36734">
        this is a bad thing but for Nadesico i say &quot;SO fucking what.&quot; The story does flip and change directions a lot, but in the end it gets its point straight across. The objective also isn&#039;t  always clear, but in the end it pretty much boils down to stopping this war that was brought up by greed, and that neither side wants to fight anymore but they want it their way or the highway. So the people of the Nadesico Kind of become there own civilization that want to end the war. <br />
      Art is no complaints, because well you know, its like 1997. Its old and the fight graphics real are cheesy but in the greatest ways. Gekiganger flare and passion slash man.<br />
      The music sound track is great, basically fitting in everywhere. The greatest theme song of all time is in there, Gekigangar 3 theme, and the op You get to Burning grows on you.<br />
      Ok this is the best part. Characters. The crew in the beginning is described as having &quot;a few personality disorders.&quot; In my opinion you have one of the most diverse and funny crew in any ship i have ever seen. My favorite character is one thats used a lot, he died twice. Gai daigoji, if im spelling that right, or Jiro Yamada. He is the soul of this show, the goofy hot blooded mecha character. He dies early but his spirit is carried on throughout the show, pushing the main character Akito onward. Gekiganger 3 is the infamous, &quot;show within a show&quot;, a Mecha cartoon series that is in Nadesico. They talk about it in every episode, and even have one dedicated to a Geki-Fest. Its the energy driving through that show that gives Nadesico its not just goofy and hot blooded side, but the one that makes each character go through their own changes and each evolve after every ordeal that they have to face that life is not Gekiganger, but that doesn&#039;t mean they cant strive for tomorrow with the same amount of hot blood that can sear threw metal like Gekiganger. There is tons of jokes in here too that crack me the fuck up, a especially the whole Yurika wanting Akito thing(plus every other girl because to the other male crew members hes a lucky ungrateful bastard).<br />
       I enjoyed this show to the fullest, each episode going by quick and wanting the next one. I lost sleep to this show, lets just say that. This show doesn&#039;t have one of the greatest endings. In fact theres so many loose ends and questions that its pretty obvious that there was gonna be a sequel. I dont think this detracts from the show though. It is what it is, i know people say to just enjoy something for what it is, but i usually have to criticize. Not for Nadesico, its ending was perfectly fine for me. It did what it had to do.<br />
        Overall i loved this show. Thats all i can really say. Its definitely at least in my top 6. Any advice would to not watch the movie. Ever. It will detract from the value of the show. Alot. Enjoy. <br />
     <br />

    Ah Nadesico, how I love thee. Personally, this is my favorite anime for multiple reasons, so let&#039;s just take a look at what makes this show worth it. Nadesico follows a fry cook reluctantly turned pilot through his screwball life in outer space with multiple dysfunctional characters exploited a hysterical level. Normally, this spells generic, but Nadesico takes a different approach to it. <br />
<br />
The show&#039;s most endearing trait is its ability to stay upbeat despite the fact that this show follows a war in space that threatens the extinction of the earth. You will never truly feel saddened by any major plot points except for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review8608">
        a possible one or two that will be painstakingly obvious once you watch the show. This ability to stay upbeat keeps a viewer from wanting to stray away from the series out of depression or just plain seeing too much of the same sad story. Nadesico can hook you in. Yeah, there&#039;s some dark spots, but Nadesico has the ability to go straight from light to dark back and forth over and over like points on a heart monitor.<br />
<br />
The next most important trait is Nadesico&#039;s characters. I&#039;ve already noted that they&#039;re dysfunctional beyond belief, what more could you want me to say? Oh yeah, they&#039;re so likable it&#039;ll kill you inside. There&#039;s a strange ability that the writers gave this show that allows the characters to all grate on each other yet grow closer to you. The interactions always breed chaos and this just makes things like a trainwreck, impossible not to watch. <br />
<br />
Clocking in at the bronze medal trait is the themes of the story. Yeah, I know I sort of talked about this at first, but you don&#039;t understand something. This is more about just how quickly your viewpoints change on things throughout the series. Your feelings towards everything just fly out of control and from then on it&#039;s just fun fun fun...<br />
<br />
The honorable mention goes to the VAs. Normally, I do find subs to be slightly better, if it&#039;s close i&#039;ll watch it, but Nadesico&#039;s dub is at least equal to, if not better than the sub. You owe it to yourself to watch the dub and at least try it before immediately going sub.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s alot more awesome stuff about Nadesico, what I said barely scratches the surface, but I can&#039;t write you a 30-page essay on it so take the scores and what&#039;s already been said to heart and watch/buy this.

    Martian Successor Nadesico follows the story of young cook/pilot Akito Tenkawa and his adventures (or lack thereof) aboard the private battleship ‘Nadesico.’ Based off this brief, single sentence description of the series, it could easily be dismissed as another Gundam clone, or just your standard, run-of-the-mill sci-fi anime. However, writing this series off as such would be a terrible mistake, as Martian Successor Nadesico has a story to tell, and you would be remiss to ignore it.<br />
<br />
Nadesico is a difficult beast to analyse; being somewhat paradoxical in nature. It does embody some of the traits of the ‘real robot’ mecha anime of Gundam fame, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review145495">
        this does not constitute its entire being. It takes elements of ‘super robot’ anime, like Getter Robo or Gurren Lagann, as well as a dash of more traditional drama and exploration-based television series, creating a sort of hybrid creature. By all means, Nadesico is not the first series to take on such an approach, but it does certainly stand out as one of the best examples of a multi-focussed series. It utilizes all of these different elements to create something that is more than the sum of its parts, something that by all logic shouldn’t work. The end result is a series that walks the fine line between chaos and control; at any moment the sheer number of different themes at work can create an utter mess, but for the most part, it all works rather well, and the series is better off because of this risk.<br />
<br />
Confusing conjecture about plot theories and influences aside, the real meat and potatoes of Nadesico comes in its plot. Throwing us right into the thick of the action of the human-Jovian conflict, the series doesn’t shy away from the central theme of war. While it may be disorienting at first, with little to no context given at the start, before long all of the plot pieces start coming together. However, it’s at the approximate midway point in the series that the story really comes into its own. Nadesico stands as one of the few series to really give a background into both sides of a conflict. It’s this multi-faceted nature that once again gives Nadesico a certain appeal. Without going into too much detail, the relationship between the two warring factions is deeply explored, and both sides are given reason to fight. A particularly intriguing sequence of events in the final few episodes sets the scene for what would be an epic conclusion. Nadesico then, tells a story not of war, but of the bonds between people and society; an aspect rarely covered in modern media.<br />
<br />
So then, in a series where the key focus is society, it would be expected that the character development would be excellent, right? Unfortunately, this is not the case. While a few characters are well defined, the vast majority suffer from poor design or just a general lack of development. Akito Tenkawa, the lead character, is the best example of character design in the series. This can largely be attributed to his time in the spotlight, but he is immediately the most relatable and likable character in the cast. From beginning to end, Tenkawa undergoes constant development, questioning the motives of not just himself, but those around him. The end result is a strong lead who is very easy to engage with. On the other side of the spectrum, literally every single female character is weak-willed and suffers from a lack of development. Yurika, the captain of the Nadesico, spends  a great deal of time in the spotlight, but ends up exactly the same as she was at the start of the series; a ditzy, shrill voiced, slightly insane woman. While it is certainly true that the majority of characters are likable, the lack of development is a major oversight, and would have gone a long way towards improving the series.<br />
<br />
There really isn’t anything particularly noteworthy regarding the presentation of this series. Character and mechanical design are rather nice, with a good use of colour, and in regards to the mechs, a good use of angles makes them seem rather realistic. It’s a sign of a good deal of research on the part of the mechanical designers, and although it may not really add much to the series, it is a nice piece of eye candy. In terms of the characters, no design was particularly noteworthy, but there isn’t really anything to complain about either. Sound design was rather mediocre as well, with an incredibly solid opening theme, but rather lacking incidental music. Sound effects were frequently reused, but what’s there is of good quality, so it can be forgiven. Also of note in terms of sound design, the opening theme to Gekiganger 3, the series that takes place within the world of Nadesico, is ludicrously catchy, and definitely warrants a listen, regardless of your stance with the Nadesico series. Animation is fluid, with no major issues. As a whole, it’s quite plain to see that the focus of this production was not presentation, but overall it gets the job done, and doesn’t really detract from the experience.<br />
<br />
Before I wrap this up, I’d just like to go into a bit more detail regarding the aforementioned Gekiganger 3. This series-within-a-series is absolutely essential to the plot of Nadesico, becoming a sort of focal point for the series. Oftentimes it’s used to compare and contrast the views of the Nadesico crew with the views put forward by popular culture, in the form of an old-school ‘super robot’ anime, in the vein of Getter Robo. The way it’s used to compliment the plot is a rather interesting idea, and it works incredibly. The relationship between the two ‘worlds’ is explored deeply, and leads to some spectacular moments in the series. In essence, Gekiganger 3 functions as not only a major plot device, but also as a ‘character’ of sorts, one which the other cast members can bounce ideas off, and one that sparks a great deal of change within the crew of the Nadesico. There is a lot more to be said about the role of Gekiganger 3, but I’d rather not ruin the surprise.<br />
<br />
All in all then, Martian Successor Nadesico is a series with a mission: it has a story to tell, and nothing else matters. Various parts of the series suffer because of this singular focus, but the quality of the story works to counteract this deficit. The story arc is incredibly well written and performed (English dub or traditional Japanese, both are equally effective) and shows a great deal of thought and planning. It’s a plot that will incite thought, but one that may prove difficult to follow if your attention lapses. The only character that is easily relatable is the lead, which is rather disappointing, but one solid character is all that’s really necessary. Yes, it could’ve worked better with more developed characters, but it is acceptable as it is. Production quality too, is acceptable but not too flashy. It works to get the message across, but not really much else. There isn’t a whole lot in the way of eye candy, but the use of colours and lighting is appealing. To summarize, Nadesico is a series that offers a lot if you’re willing to engage with the story. If not however, you’ll find a somewhat pleasant series lacking in character development, but still an enjoyable experience.<br />

    It&#039;s surprising when your talking to your friend one day, and your friend pops you a question out of the blue. &quot;Have you ever heard of Nadesico?&quot; The response was immediately. &quot;No why?&quot; &quot;It&#039;s rated as one of the greatest Comedy anime series in Japan&quot;  Now with that said, i was curious about Martian Successor Nadesico, i was curious as to why it was rated one of the greatest comical anime series in Japan, as my friend mention and showed me in one of his magazines. So i decided to watch it. What happens after that was probably one of the greatest enjoyments of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25292">
        my life. Never have I witness a Anime series where it is so light hearted, and so....just so funny and yet there&#039;s people dying here and there, but that doesn&#039;t stop the series from being more funny, I mean, i never seen a anime series that has a anime inside of anime, yea i know your probably wondering how is this computing, but when you watch it, you will figure that out. If it makes it simpiler heres a simpliar way to explain it<br />
<br />
Anime A is Nadisco,  crew members in Anime A watch Gekigangar which is Anime B, now one episode Anime B which is Gekigangar is watching Anime A which is Nadesico<br />
<br />
Story = 10<br />
<br />
The story is Mars being invaded, and the main character mysterious teleported to Earth at the time of the invasion, while being attack. Anyways the main Character Akito, is a cook employed by a private battle ship Nadesico, though the cook is always complaining that he just wants to be a cook and not a pilot. Unfortunately it doesn&#039;t quiet help when he has something that allows him to pilot the mechs. The story has a couple of screw and curve balls and never have i seen a series where you have people die, and then something happens to lift the serious and brooding tone, i mean the brooding tone doesn&#039;t even last for 15 minutes, because something happens to bring  back the funny atmosphere. Sometimes I wonder if it was spoofing the infamous series Neon Genesis Evangelion since the english actors who play the character in Neon Genesis also voice act in the series too, as the voice actor who voiced Shinji is voicing the main character Akito Tenkawa<br />
<br />
Art = 10<br />
<br />
Art- Art is impressive, love the design of the mechs, and especially  the craftsmanship of the design of the Spaceship Nadesico. Also impressive is the art style of the characters, the character designs are very unique, which i believe setted up templettes of other characters to come, such as Primula from Shuffle! looks awfully a lot like Ruri from this series. Being that this is a 90&#039;s show the art is still impressive.<br />
<br />
Sound = 8<br />
<br />
The music sets the tone, and in this case Nadesico successes in that aspect, also the music makes this series stand out somewhat from other series, though its may not be the greatest soundtrack ever created, it certianly is good nonetheless, as i believe after watching the opening of the show<br />
<br />
Character = 10<br />
<br />
This is where the magic of the show drags you in, as you slowly begin to learn each and every crew member. I especially think Ruri was extremely well done, i have never laugh so much from a girl whose dead pan and smart attitude cracked me up so much. As i said all the crew members are well done, you get to learn every one pervious jobs, like the pilot Minato, whose previous job was being the secretary, though being on that ship i wonder why did we let a secretary pilot a top of the mil spacecraft.<br />
<br />
Lets go through some characters shall we? <br />
<br />
Akito Tenkawa- Major goal in life is to be a cook, but is having a hard time achieving that goal due to some techinal diffculties of being a backup pilot, despite his most memorable quote &quot;I&#039;M JUST A COOK!&quot;<br />
<br />
Captain Yurika Misumaru- The childhood friend of Akito, and is probably one of the most ditzies captains i have ever seen in anime existance, well ok maybe not the dizties, but very close. Usually absent minded, thinking about her crush, which can sometimes put the entire crew in dire straights, but being the best in her field as a captain she usually pulls through<br />
<br />
Gai Daigoji- In my wildest dreams, never...i mean NEVER, would i have thought about meeting an otaku pilot. In fact i think its the first character in anime history i have ever seen being a Otaku nut pilot. He loves the anime Gekigangar and the show is the reason why he is a pilot so he could accomplish his dream of piloting a giant mech<br />
<br />
Ruri Hoshino- Probably the most funniest and the memorable character, her deadpan tone and witty nature just makes me laugh with her usuall catchphrase being &quot;Idiots&quot;<br />
<br />
Enjoyment = 10<br />
<br />
The series has a lot things that is enjoyable and makes me laugh, especially after the fact that the series has its own anime in the name of Gekigangar, which spoof the late 70&#039;s anime shows. The show even has an Otaku Pilot for crying out loud! Never have i before seen a anime series that has a otaku piloting a mecha. Occasional witty humor especially from Ruri. Also never have i ever seen a anime series that successfully broke down the forth wall and then procede to do what they were doing like nothing had ever happen<br />
<br />
Overall = 10<br />
<br />
Overall this is a series you should not miss. If you like a series that lampoons Mecha&#039;s, and has a great story, then this is the show for you to watch!<br />
<br />

    Now people that have been reading other reviews that I have written might know that there is one thing that I severely crack down on, and that is overused character types and clichés, and this anime is just overflowing with them.<br />
The characterlist consists of the biggest amount of over-the-top cliché characters, the situations are all so familiar and the story seems to be rather generic at first.<br />
<br />
Yes that&#039;s right, at first. In this anime the clichés actually work and the characters fit perfectly into the story, even if you get the standard practically emo main male character, the airhead that has an overobvious affection for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review13245">
        him, the tomboy, the robot-loli girl and everything else that you can possibly imagine. And it works beyond comprehension.<br />
The reason for this is that the anime is set out as a parody on all the clichés and the generic mecha story telling. It&#039;s so far over-the-top that they even do that with all the clichés and surprisingly that&#039;s what makes them all funny again.<br />
You know the cliché about a girl wanting to make lunch/dinner for the guy of their affection and it turns out she can&#039;t cook to save her life and it ends up being pure poison? Well, that one is in here too, however the guy is the ship&#039;s cook, and it&#039;s not one girl but three that try to push their poison onto him. The situation surrounding that whole tired old cliché is so absurd and completely ridiculous and the way the characters react and interact make it absurdly funny again, and it continues that same trend all the way through the anime.<br />
<br />
However, this anime isn&#039;t just a vehicle for bizarre takes on clichés, it also has an incredible story and takes some completely unsuspecting plot twists, and because of the characters, and the empathy you&#039;ll start to feel for them as the story progresses, it turns into something that many mecha anime of today can learn a great deal from.<br />
Nadesico can truelly strike some serious hits in-between the maniacal comedy, and that&#039;s a feat of amazing writing.<br />
<br />
Now after this lengthy intro, let&#039;s look at my scores:<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
What can I say, the story is a work of art. Even if it&#039;s over-the-top in some places and filled with clichés, it works amazingly and it can really immerse the viewer. It works in both the comedy and the serious parts and the plot twists can take the viewer completely by surprise and throws all speculations to the ending overboard.<br />
There were several moments when I was really wincing at what was going on because at times the story just goes too far with being over-the-top and that lowered the score for me a bit, because wanting to press forward to get past several parts isn&#039;t really what needs to be included.<br />
But overall, an amazing story, so a 9.<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
The art in the anime felt rather generic for a mecha anime at most times, but since it&#039;s intended to appear like that, I really shouldn&#039;t complain.<br />
It works well with the story, even if and maybe because it looks so generic.<br />
And since it works, it earns a 7 for just being good.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
Well, to be honest, I&#039;m a story and character kinda guy so I don&#039;t really pay much attention to the sound, I do put on the original Japanese version because I can&#039;t stand most of the American voice actors and I think in most cases part of the story gets lost in translation, and a little feel for the characters since the Japanese are usually better at fitting voice actors with the characters they represent.<br />
But I digress, the sound didn&#039;t bother me in one bit and the mood fitted well, so a 7.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8<br />
I&#039;m a bit split on this subject. The characters are completely generic, cliché and over-the-top, so I should be rating this a big fat 1, however they fit so perfectly with the feel of the anime and the whole story that it wouldn&#039;t be the same (or any good) without them being the way they are.<br />
So I guess I can do little else besides rate is as an 8.<br />
It&#039;s very good, even though over-the-top, generic and cliché.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
Seriously, this is one of the most enjoyable anime I have seen.<br />
Immersive story, loveable characters, great humour, immense depth and still able to be serious to the point that the viewer will actually take it seriously instead of thinking that they are trying to be pretentious.<br />
There is hardly any comment to make... It&#039;s enjoyable to the extreme.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
Taking all of the above comments and scores into account, I can only say that this anime is just great!<br />
It&#039;s sadly underrated in my opinion and should deserve much more attention than it has gotten.<br />
There is hardly anything left to say, so I give it a 9 for being overall great.<br />
<br />
<br />
Afterthoughts:<br />
Too bad that people that are going to watch Nadesico from now on will try to make comparisons with Gurren Lagann...<br />
I can only say to those people that Gurren Lagann is indeed just as far over-the-top and cliché as Nadesico, however Nadesico shows clearly that it&#039;s a parody, using great humour and a captivating story, while Gurren Lagann doesn&#039;t clearly show that it wants to be a parody (I don&#039;t even think that it is meant as a parody).<br />
In my opinion there isn&#039;t much on which you can compare them, except that they are both mecha anime that are a bit over-the-top and full of clichés. The major differences lie in how they present themselves, which is something that in my opinion works extremely well for Nadesico and what breaks Gurren Lagann for me, since it seems TTGL tries to be serious and not a parody.<br />
<br />

Thank you in advance.

    There was a guy I know back in 90&#039;s Sacramento known as Steve McIntosh. He introduced me to Nadesico... I have never heard from him again and I guess, maybe, it&#039;s a good thing for me. Back when I was watching Nadesico; I was &quot;super-naive&quot; and thought I could accept anything. I was also a &quot;(damn) fool.&quot;<br />
<br />
Onto my so-called &quot;review&quot; and WHY I consider this animu &quot;THE WORST EVER CREATED second only to Evangelion.&quot;<br />
<br />
* The &quot;harem animu&quot; elements ruined its &quot;serious mecha anime&quot; elements.<br />
<br />
* Akito, the shounen lead, is &quot;afraid of women&quot; (an element required for the otaku-base to self-insert into). His inability to handle

          <span style="display: none;" id="review68739">
        women and his own hormones transfers into his (in)ability to fight in his mecha.<br />
<br />
* And while this &quot;love-shape&quot; is going on with Akito; every other guy is getting dumped and sidelined, sometimes for comical effect at a guy&#039;s expense.<br />
<br />
* I lean more towards &quot;real robot&quot; shows like Tomino&#039;s / UC era Gundam (than &quot;super-robot&quot; shows). But even a thin-skinned, no-talent hack can create better enemies to fight against than this. Then again, I guess I&#039;d feel a little better if the enemy had been squared on the first episode; as opposed to being trolled because a creator doesn&#039;t have a clue on how to make convincing enemies.<br />
<br />
Speaking of being thin-skinned; I reminded myself of how horrible my experiences were from watching this poorly-written, by-and-for the otaku harem animu masquerading as a mecha anime. I didn&#039;t get a chance to watch all of Gundam Wing but it was a pretty good show; one that can remind people of how much better a mecha show can be without focusing on harem antics as some cute girl&#039;s behind.

    I just ADORE this anime!!! It&#039;s one of my favorites!! I hadn&#039;t even heard of it until one of my friends mentioned it to me. <br />
<br />
The story is amazing. It&#039;s an awesome mixture of funny and serious. The plot is interesting and it keeps your attention. I know a few times I was just like wha-?! and totally caught off guard by the plot twist. I especially love the anime within an anime concept. Hehe. <br />
<br />
I thought the animation was good. The dubbing is amazing too! I love the dubbed version personally. As for the characters, they&#039;re all so different and have little problems of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10701">
        their own. They&#039;re all very likable and after watching just a few episodes you feel like you know them and are a part of the Nadesico crew. You&#039;ll get so drawn in and you&#039;ll HAVE to see what comes next!<br />
<br />
Overall, this goofy, satirical and sometimes serious anime is really a lot of fun to watch.

       Whoever said that a series couldn&#039;t have too many wacky female characters hadn&#039;t seen Martian Successor Nadesico. 80% of the cast are women with personality defects, not that the men are completely sane. <br />
   This show takes the &amp;quot;one guy living with a group of crazy girls who are all in love with him&amp;quot; formula and combines it with a Mobile Suit Gundam reminiscent plot. Y&#039;know, a sympathetic war/ space odyssey type deal. Does this work, one man, trapped on a space battle ship with countless beautiful women? Well, strangely enough, it does.<br />
   A friend of mine described

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6063">
        this series as having some of the greatest anime characters of all time, and though I don&#039;t agree with him, I see where he was coming from. If I were to describe the protagonist, Akito Tenkawa, I&#039;d say imagine Hideki Motosuwa or Keitaro Urashima but put them in the same situation as Amuro Ray or Shinji Ikari. It sounds interesting, doesn&#039;t it?<br />
   The plot sounds pretty typical at first. I mean, do we really need another humans fighting aliens with giant robots anime: Evangelion, RaXephon, Dai-Guard, Argentosoma, Voices of a Distant Star, ect. Though, as you get farther into it, the plot becomes much more deep and complex than one would imagine. There are many unexpected twists that I wouldn&#039;t dream of ruining for everyone.<br />
   Overall, Martian Successor Nadesico is something I loved but didn&#039;t expect to. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys space odysseys or anime with intense character relationships. Enjoy.<br />

    I recently rewatched this anime so it&#039;s a great time to write a review on it while it&#039;s still fresh in my memory.<br />
First thing to explain, this is anime manages the razor&#039;s edge of being both serious and a satire.    It is a rather biting satire of space animes and particularly the gundam series of anime.  This is all done subtle however, in the background while a (mostly) serious plot continues and the Earth&#039;s protectors fight against other worldly invasion.<br />
The effort succeeds greatly and this anime was a great hit in Japan when it was released but didn&#039;t enjoy much success

          <span style="display: none;" id="review13796">
        in the US.<br />
<br />
Story: The story starts with the Earth&#039;s military getting beaten badly by the attacking Jovian forces.  Fed up with the military&#039;s ineptitude, Nerghal Heavy Industries commissions and launches the battleship Nadesico.  Being a private corporation they use unorthodox criteria in recruiting the crew.  Using technology on par or even better than the Jovians, the Nadesico enters the fight, dealing with the enemy, a very jealous regular military, a popular anime show that seems to both mimic and mock events as they occurs, and of course the many neuroses and quirks of it&#039;s own crew.<br />
<br />
Art: Animated when Cel animation was still the method of choice, it can look older than it is.  This maybe partly intentional however since many of the animes it spoofing are from the 80&#039;s (Robotech, Starblazers, Gundam)<br />
<br />
Sound: Using a dramatic soundtrack throughout the course of the show really helps  The theme song, &quot;You get to Burning&quot;, is a classic of course.<br />
<br />
Character: The storyline is overall pretty serious, so it&#039;s up to the characters to drive the satire; which they do beautifully.<br />
The main character is Akito Tenkawa.  He joins the crew after encountering Yurika, the ship&#039;s captain and childhood friend, and seeks questions concerning a past mystery.  Akito joins as a cook on the ship, but is repeatedly required to fill in as part-time robot pilot (called an Aestevalis).  He&#039;s also a rabid fanboy of the anime &quot;Gekigainger&quot;.  The anime within an anime is a subtle jab at giant robot animes, even to the point where there is an episode where the Gekigainger cast is watching Nadesico.<br />
The other main character, Yurika, is a nod to female anime characters that have very important responsibilities but still act like little girls around a love interest (in this case Akito).  Her obsession with him continues throughout the series.<br />
It&#039;s really an ensemble cast that makes this work, but the 3rd essential character is Ruri (also called Ruri Ruri).  A young girl who is very smart, but also very droll and fond of calling everyone idiots.  She narrates the plot and also acts as the voice of sanity.  It&#039;s her calm analysis that keeps the rest of the crew on task, and also makes the rest of them seem that much more wacky.  Even the &quot;serious&quot; characters seem zany compared to the grounded Ruri.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: The dual-purpose of the anime can also lose the viewer, otherwise I&#039;d give it a 10.  The shifts from humor, satire, to seriousness can be sudden and jarring.  There&#039;s also some satire of &quot;harem&quot; animes as Akito is pursued by at least 3 of the female crewmembers, to the dismay of his &quot;immature&quot; personality.  This often leads to many joke of the rest of the crew demanding he send them there way if he doesn&#039;t want them.<br />
<br />
Overall: This would be a decent anime if they had decided to play it straight, but the satire of it makes it a classic.  A lot of the humor is subtle and understated.  For instance, in one episode Akito is stranded on the moon and is waiting to get picked up by the ship.  The woman at the restaurant calls it &quot;the Yamato&quot; and her husband corrects her.  Of course this references the ship from &quot;Starblazers&quot; (I&#039;m using the US title, I know that&#039;s not the original name).  It&#039;s all the small things like that, that makes this one a gem.

    This is my first review so i was wondering which anime i should review. i decided to review the anime that began it all for me. Martian Successor Nadesico (Nadesico for short) was the 1st series i ever completed and up to now it still is 1 of my all-time favorites. With a mixture of different genre, mecha,romance,comedy,harem and a little drama it makes a perfect mixture to go along with a very good story plot. To be Nadesico is very underrated or should i say very unheard of? This anime is for just about any 1 especially the people who like to see a

    At the time of release both Studio Xebec and director Tatsuo Satou were very much unknown. The only works before were unsuccessful tries into the anime industry such as Gekiganger 3 (originally created by Satou). This work over Nadesico turned out to be a raging success for Xebec for the company’s future anime endeavours and the harem genre such as Love Hina and To Love-Ru.<br />
<br />
The story in Nadesico is very very simplistic. Alien invaders destroy Mars, our main character Akito’s home, and he is transported to Earth without memory of what happened prior. Later, he joins the crew of a new battleship called Nadesico where

          <span style="display: none;" id="review219643">
        he wants to be a cook. There he meets his ditzy childhood friend, Captain Yurika. A war ends up unfolding and of course, Akito becomes the ship’s mecha pilot. Basically, the story and setting are a parody for old 70 and 80’s mecha anime such as the heavily influenced Macross.<br />
<br />
The characters are all comically put together and their misfit personalities create a comedic environment throughout the show. Sure, the anime has elements for everyone from romance and comedy to mecha and action, but the constant switching and poorly executed slap stick comedy makes for a task-filled job for watching. Each element that is trying to be parodied misses its mark and because there never is a focus, most lame jokes just fly over the viewers head.<br />
<br />
Coming out in 1996, this anime has not aged well. Even during release, Nadesico already looked old like something more out of the late 80’s. Even the poor low quality audio, muffled action sounds, and the still-shot animation during fight scenes are unacceptable. Not to mention the abysmal voice acting. While the Japanese voice acting is bearable, the English is unwatchable. Most of the voices are off key and or bland, especially our main character. Worst of all, the plot is mostly pushed aside and where key elements in the story could be emphasized, the anime decides to push it aside like a slight summer breeze and focus more on the poorly executed harem comedy elements. It is the perfect example of how not to do action, plot, and harem all wrapped into a single show. Nadesico is a plain bad anime trying to make fun of the past. Instead, this anime is laughably poorly put together.

    The kind of show I would only recommend to someone that just loves making fun of the most hysterically bad anime, a lot like Garzey&#039;s Wing. If you need an example.<br />
<br />
Before I start shitting on this anime, I wanna give it a brief pat on the back for presenting something that isn&#039;t particularly common nowadays. A romantic subplot. I haven&#039;t gotten far enough to see how it resolves, if I know these kinds of subplots I am going to make a guess and say that Megumi and Akito go out for awhile and Megumi dies. Afterwards, Akito hits dat Cap&#039;n ass and makes her scream

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265908">
        &quot;YURIKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&quot; and so forth... In hindsight, Akito was already thinking about Yurika while dating Megumi so i&#039;m probably wrong. Eh, who cares. The backspace is all the way up there; not moving my fingers that far.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the show is very spastic for the sake of telling a longer than normal story while also using what feels like increasing the speed of a nightcore youtube video to &quot;2&quot; for comedic effect. This makes it SO hard to grasp what even is happening for the first 2 episodes. And even when you know what&#039;s happening, it&#039;s absolutely mind-boggling how little they care about the things going on around them. It&#039;s like watching a whole different timeline where death is a joke to them and they constantly use it as a means for comedic episodes that&#039;s literally unimportant for the first 15 minutes of the episode until the plot decides to kick-in.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s hard to care about ANY of the characters because they are either a Shinji rip-off or a joke. Oh and the voice acting is... Hilariously bad. Not as hilarious or bad as Early Reins&#039; VAs but... Well, it&#039;s up there. I&#039;m going to laugh arrogangly now:<br />
<br />
Hahaha HAHAHA hahaha HAHAHA
