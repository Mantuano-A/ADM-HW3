Oh yes, after a long time of waiting it is finally time for the highly anticipated second season of Kiniro Mosaic.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not going to bother making a super in-depth analysis of the anime because I really don&#039;t think it&#039;s necessary. Kiniro Mosaic is an intentionally simplistic show which requires very little explanation. If you&#039;ve seen the first season of the anime (which you should have if you&#039;re reading this), then you&#039;ll know just what to expect. And you&#039;ll get it, because season two is pretty much just more of the same as the first one. Aya is still one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190831">
        of cutest tsunderes ever, Karen&#039;s English is still hilariously broken and Shino still has an unhealthy obsession with blondes. And that&#039;s all that Kiniro Mosaic really needs to be, because it&#039;s enough for it to successfully maintain its position as one of the best slice of life comedies in the anime industry.<br />
<br />
One new addition to the franchise though is Kuzehashi Akari: a new homeroom teacher at the school and one of the more prevalent characters of this second season of Kiniro Mosaic. She has a complex about her popularity, as she wants nothing more than to be liked and respected by the students in her class. However for various reasons... she is not very good at this, and more often than not ends up scaring them off instead.<br />
<br />
Some of the side characters also get more screen time than in the first season. There is the tennis club member Honoka who ends up joining Shino as her fellow sister-in-arms in the fanclub for blondes, Shino&#039;s absent-minded yet caring older sister Isami, and also Youko&#039;s younger siblings who reveal themselves to be some of the most hilarious trolls I&#039;ve ever seen. As far as the main quintet goes however, they&#039;re exactly the same as they always were, and I don&#039;t think anyone could possibly feel bad about that.<br />
<br />
The animation looks just as crisp and clean as the first season, with a heavy emphasis on moe artwork, and it feels perfectly suited to the tone of the show itself. The opening theme, &quot;Yumiero Parade&quot;, is extremely catchy and fun to listen to, and it also has some variation to it as different characters sing a slightly altered version of it every week. There&#039;s also the one-time opening theme called &quot;Kirameki-iro Summer Rainbow&quot; used only in episode 10, which is quite frankly one of the best OPs I have ever heard in anime, and I&#039;m still desperately trying to find a full version of it somewhere. The ED theme &quot;My Best Friends&quot; is less impressive but certainly passable as well.<br />
<br />
But all-in-all, Kiniro Mosaic is simply a show which never fails to entertain during even its most mundane moments, solely due to the friendly atmosphere and how enjoyable the characters are. They&#039;re adorable, energetic and charismatic all at the same time, and they always manage to make you smile when watching the anime. Kiniro Mosaic might very well be the epitome of the &quot;Cute Girls Doing Cute Things&quot; genre, and this second season makes a very strong showcasing as to why.<br />
<br />
Highly recommended.

    Do you want to escape the harsh realities of life? You sick of your anime list full of action, supernatural and mainstream shows with tons of fanservice? Are you tired of harem battles and complex story lines that lead to never ending episodes that go until to end of time? Do you want something new? Well you just found the right place. Ah.. Slice of Life. What better way to start your day by watching cute girls go to school and have fun along the way. Kiniro Mosaic has been one of my favorite cute-girls-doing-cute-things kind of show, and as a fan of the first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review187935">
        season this show has made me love the Slice of Life genre more than before. So lets go on the review..<br />
<br />
Story (7/10)<br />
As for the story line is concerned, there is basically no such thing, but it offers us the main heroines of the story living their high school lives, enjoying each others company and making enjoyable memories that they will remember instead. The thing with Kiniro Mosaic or basically every Slice of Life show is that it doesn&#039;t need complex story lines or plot twists to make it enjoyable. You don&#039;t need to use a lot of your brain cells to know about how the MC will become a Hok*ge or how will Mr. Fantastic find the 1 piece, but instead all you need to do is click on one episode and let the show speak for itself. <br />
<br />
As a fan of cute girls, this show has one of the most loveable and adorable characters in the Slice of Life genre in my opinion. Art has improved compared to the previous season, the settings and backgrounds became more vivid, colorful and brighter, making you enjoy the colorful happiness of this show. Life in the school and places in England has been displayed well in each episode. The art helps enhance the mood in specific situations thus making it one good colorful show. <br />
<br />
But wait, there&#039;s more. No Kiniro Mosaic review will be complete if you don&#039;t mention how the characters speak in english, wait pardon me but I believe the correct term for this is Engrish. This is what happens when the seiyuus try to speak a language different from their native tounge. But does this make the show bad, horrible or dropped material? No. Engrish makes the show complete and more fun to watch.  And everytime you remember Karen speaking engrish or basically all of them speak engrish becomes like an addictive drug, I found myself spending my hours watching them just speak english in youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1YSEDT-ZPc), my heart is not ready, it hurts, the moe is real. But kidding aside the engrish in this season took a major leap compared to the previous one, perhaps the seiyuus practiced hard for each english part in the script and I salute you for that.<br />
<br />
OP and ED is one of my new favorite op and ed&#039;s in this season. The ED &quot;My Best Friends&quot; by Rhodanthe is one of my most played songs in my phone as of now, because it has this &quot;English kind of tune&quot; that is rare to hear in this era.<br />
<br />
Overall Kiniro Mosaic Season 2 is a great slice of life show, like the previous season you wont get tired of the cliche comedy and friendly quarrels of every character. And even if you don&#039;t follow the chronological order of the episodes you still get to enjoy each and every one of it.  If you like cute-girls-doing-cute-things kind of shows with a good sense of comedy. I definitely recommend this to all.

    I&#039;ve been waiting for this season~ ^^<br />
Ever since watching the first season I got hooked on it!<br />
<br />
Although most of my reviews focus on the plot this one doesn&#039;t have a solid one.<br />
It&#039;s just about the characters daily lives at school. Simple as that.<br />
<br />
The part I love about this anime is the cute artwork, the characters and the songs!<br />
<br />
For people who watch this series they would have already paired the characters up as the pairings in the series is simple.<br />
ShinoXAlice, YokoXAya and Karen goes all over the place.<br />
<br />
In this season a few things change.<br />
<br />
If I continue on it will just spoil the whole series, so just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review192331">
        go and watch (If you watched the first season then that&#039;s more of a reason to continue onto the next season!)<br />
<br />
Also let&#039;s not criticize the English that is used in the series that much. I mean I understand why but still give it a break. (It has improved a lot compared to the first season! really!)

    Hello!! Kiniro Mosaic is a light and enjoyable slice of life about a group of friends. The story focuses around the contrast between two different cultures that the group faces, since two of the girl&#039;s are English. <br />
This anime will keep you engaged with it&#039;s comedy, fanservice and obviously, the strong bound that the girls share.<br />
<br />
I was quite pleased when the second season came out and watched every episode in the day of its release. I found the first season OK, so I didn&#039;t want to have high expectations for the 2nd season.<br />
<br />
Well, let&#039;s get started with the ratings<br />
<br />
Story 6/10<br />
I have to give a low

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190493">
        score in this category because since we are talking about a second season we have to take into account the previous seasons, and in fact, Kiniro Mosaic has a more complex storyline than Hello! Kiniro Mosaic because we have the growth of the relationship between Shino and Alice and Alice&#039;s arrival to Japan and her fitting in with this new culture and by result, with Japanese people. The second season is basically Shino and Alice&#039;s bound getting stronger along with their other friends and other than that there&#039;s nothing new into it from season one to two.<br />
<br />
Anyway, even tho the story didn&#039;t had any progress there&#039;s a continuous line that does not go down but also doesn&#039;t go up. There is always something new in every episode and it does not fail to contrast two different cultures and countries, being that the main goal since this anime started.<br />
<br />
Altogether I think this category deserves a 6 out of 10 because although Kiniro has a captivating story, there is no progress and leaves a bit to be desired.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art 7/10<br />
Kiniro has a good art, nothing innovating or unusual since the first season, except perhaps the change of area beyond the typical school which I was already getting tired of. <br />
There is a greater diversity of places in this second season, which undoubtedly is a plus in my opinion.<br />
<br />
The characters are well designed according to their personalities and stereotypes, like we already known from the first season.<br />
<br />
The environment in which the characters are part of is light and colorful as in every slice of life involving school, and like already said above, I liked the change of space that occurs throughout the anime.<br />
<br />
I evaluate 7 of 10 in this category because although having a nice art that appeals the observer I can’t simply give more to something that isn’t innovating facing other Slice of life anime of this type.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound 7/10<br />
Well then, regarding the sound, I can say it was good.<br />
<br />
The opening and ending are enjoyable to listen to, I even heard them a few times but I ended up passing them forward since they weren’t that catchy (no opening beats yuri yuri, sorry). <br />
<br />
Despite this, I can say that both the OP and the ED are suitable for the anime and captures perfectly the purpose, that it, the strong bond between the characters.<br />
<br />
The voice actors were properly chosen for the characters even though Alice’s voice still annoyed me a little. I can only applaud to Karen’s voice actor that did an exceptional job with her accent even tho she is Japanese, each time I heard her voice I could not help but smile or even a laugh, it just fits that character really well.<br />
<br />
Regarding the sound I give 7 out of 10, because although the characters mostly have a voice actor suitable for them, the music we hear throughout the anime did not have any connective role, the only times I noticed some kind of sound was when showing images to summarize a day they spend together, for example. There was nothing great that would capture the senses of the viewer but it was not that bad either.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters 7/10<br />
Oh wow, the characters… this is going to be complicated since they are so unique!<br />
<br />
Let’s start for the bad part… Shino and Alice were the main-main characters in season one, but in Hello Kiniro Mosaic I couldn’t be much happier that they let the other characters prove themselves out. I was really happy for that since I love Karen and Ayaya so much! <br />
<br />
In my opinion there’s nothing intriguing in Alice and Shinobu. As I said before, Alice’s voice and personality are irritating and Shino and the other tennis girl are really scary, they take their love for blonde hair to a new level… I couldn’t find that funny at all. SCARY. Shinobu and Alice are the typical cute-looking airheads, I can’t even ship them. <br />
<br />
In other hand, I couldn’t help finding Aya and Youko so cute together, who doesn’t like the tsun girl trying to voice her feelings correctly cute? And Youko is the typical boyish girl that has a soft heart for her little twin brothers that are a good add to this season.<br />
<br />
Karen was my favorite indeed! Who didn’t like Karen? She is upbeat and fun to hang around with, I would love a Karin in my life, even tho she is rich and spoiled she still is humble and a good friend, for me, the best character in the whole anime. <br />
<br />
I really like Karen-chan messing around with Kuzehashi sensei, another character that I wanted to hear more about, her reactions are really cute and show how an adult can be dorky and insecure like high schoolers.<br />
<br />
The characters in general were good. Some of them are very good and some a bit boring so I&#039;ll stick with a 7 out of 10 because I like Karen, Ayaya and the new teacher a lot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 7/10<br />
Since I watched one episode per week I didn’t had time to get tired of it or even miss the anime.<br />
<br />
I watched every Sunday each episode in its release thinking of my favorite characters, since I wanted to laugh a bit and there’s nothing better to do in a Sunday, so why not watch a single episode of Kiniro?<br />
<br />
It’s enjoyable if you watch it from time to time, but it would be boring if it was watched in a row. That’s why I will give it 7 out of 10.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall 7/10<br />
<br />
Overall, I liked this season much better than the last one because my favorite characters were more active and it’s much better in terms of FANSERVICE and also COMEDY.<br />
<br />
For the ones that are thinking of watching, first watch the first season and if you already did then proceed with this one cause you won’t regret it, but remember to not to watch this all in once, since it can may get a bit boring since it lacks of action. My advice is to watch one episode per day or even vary a bit on anime with other genres.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope my review is helpful, thanks for reading. <br />

    Cute, heart-warming ending for a perfect Spring 2015. And the first to be completed on my spring list. So what do i think about this sequel? <br />
<br />
I supposed to give 5/10 but because it ended nicely, i gave the rate of the story 6/10. It doesn&#039;t really have any plot about the series, just a series about girl&#039;s everyday life and CGDCT. Though it has no plots, the story continued where season 1 ended. Entering their second year, goes to same school but this time Alice and Shino are in different class, which makes Alice feel lonely. Well though no plots, at least im happy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review187340">
        to see Aya&#039;s tsundere mode.<br />
<br />
The art, doesn&#039;t change a lot since it&#039;s similar alot to season 1, fluidity of the animation is decent and background images were appealing too. So i give a rate of 7/10<br />
<br />
The sound, they just recycled the OSTs from season 1, only changes is the OPs and the EDs, ED song are more based on Britain culture. OP song was energetic. Rate 7/10<br />
<br />
The characters, i typically like would be Komichi Aya, since she had that tsundere trait and that &quot;get fast blushing face&quot; whenever she is with Youko, i just love her reaction, on other side, her maturity was really nice. Kujou Karen, who is half-Japanese and Britain but speaks japanese more than engrish, the way she speak is so similar that i can compare it to one of the Kancolle characters whom she is from Britain too. Energetic kind of person and loves to engage socially with other people. Rate 8/10<br />
<br />
By far, i have enjoyed watching this series, it lifts my spirit up or make my depression *poof* after watching some of the feels anime for such Plastic Memories, it will make you laugh and also refresh your day if you watch in early morning, in my case 6 AM since i got school so yeah. Rate 8/10<br />
<br />
Anyway I&#039;m glad that they made season 2 because i was expecting a lot from them since season 1 was having a good reputation. They did a good job on season 2, hopefully they would make a season 3 or at least an ova to finish off the manga volume left, anyway perfect end for my spring list, now i have to finish off the rest of the other spring list and move on to summer list.<br />
<br />
Overall 8/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Those who haven&#039;t or currently watching:<br />
~Happy watching~

    (This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)<br />
<br />
In elementary school, my four closest buddies and I would call ourselves “The Five Musketeers.” That’s because we did pretty much everything together while at school: sports, group activities, hanging out, making jokes, etc. We always had a blast and created memories that will last a lifetime. While we slowly drifted apart to the point that we no longer see each other, I’ll always remember them as the best friends that I ever had. Hello!! Kiniro Mosaic follows a similar troupe, showcasing impossibly cute moments while demonstrating the bonds of friendship in a familiar way.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Kinmoza 2

          <span style="display: none;" id="review194317">
        (as it will be called from here on out) is the sequel to “Kiniro Mosaic.” Shino, Alice, Karen, Ayaya, and Yoko are back, alongside a few new characters, to bring about their signature adorableness once more.<br />
<br />
This cannot be overstated; the Kinmoza series is near the top, if not the pinnacle, when it comes to cuteness. Often times, anime is known for shows being of the “cute girls doing cute things” variety. But in Kinmoza 2’s case, the second half of that phrase is dropped. It’s simply “cute girls.” The girls don’t do anything pertaining to the plot, they aren’t striving for a particular goal, and they aren’t necessarily interested in doing anything completely out of the ordinary. It really is a show designed around a bunch of girls being as cute as possible in everyday situations. They visit the beach, each other’s houses, other countries; they have picnics at school, tennis matches, study sessions; and they even gather at the mall and on the street. The anime is everyday happenings with the added benefit of watching these girls interact with one another.<br />
<br />
There could be an argument for the anime being more than “just” a bunch of high school girls having a good time together. This harkens back to the introduction: the idea of friendships and the memories we share. Such a notion works to an extent, considering how much the girls do pretty much everything with one another. But the idea loses its focus when it goes back to Shino fawning over blonde hair or Karen acting extremely hyper. They are good friends and they are making memories they’ll never forget, yet they’re never too worried about the future or even the past. To them, and the anime, all that matters is what is going on now, at a singular moment in time.<br />
<br />
At this point, there isn’t too much else to say, really. Kinmoza 2 isn’t looking to make you think critically or provide profound themes that inspire one to question his or her philosophical being. It’s a slice-of-life show aimed at making the audience smile. To that end, the characters are the driving force, not the narrative. This is evident in what the anime offers. Looking at it closely, it is (like its predecessor) a lot of repetition in terms of jokes, gags, and general comedy. Ultimately the situations boil down to whose shtick is holding the spotlight or is being used in unison with another character’s personality. The events don’t mean anything; rather than the characters and what they do being a byproduct of the situations they find themselves in, the only purpose is having Shino and the gang be as cute as possible.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
<br />
One of the ways in which Kinmoza 2 achieves maximum “moe” is through the art and character designs that it utilizes.<br />
<br />
The art itself is very soft in its presentation. The colors aren’t invasive or distracting on the eye, there’s a soft, white hue surrounding the shots, and the locations visited provide the appropriate setting – the school, Shino’s room, their local meeting spot, etc. – without being overly intrusive. In short, the show is gently inviting the audience to relax and simply enjoy the characters and their antics. At the same time, the show incorporates “chibi” or “minimalist” techniques to make the characters less detailed, often smaller, and therefore cuter because of it all.<br />
<br />
Inspecting the character designs, it’s easy to see once again how much attention is placed on making the girls as cute in appearance as possible. The veterans return with their signature looks – Shino with her medium-length hair and obscure fashion attire, Karen’s long blonde hair with matching Union Jack coat, and Ayaya’s blue twin-tails with constant blushing, to name a few. Newcomers Kuzehashi-sensei and Honoka maintain the cute factor as well. Kuzehashi-sensei’s side ponytail mixed with her secretary-like work outfit is a nice look for the woman and Honoka’s long brown hair and general plainness contrasts well with the other girls, proving that the show can create nice designs even for the additional cast members.<br />
<br />
Actual animation remains somewhere around average. The anime mostly moves from one shot to the next in order to keep up with the quick pace of the comedy. Reactions are mostly comical expressions, actual movement is usually not too involved besides the occasional hop, skip, or hug, and even then, the characters are usually standing around. There does exist particularly high-quality animation sequences – such as when Kuzehashi-sensei and Karasuma-sensei attempt to high-five – but they are so few and far between that they aren’t entirely worth mentioning.<br />

Like the plot, Kinmoza 2’s characters aren’t there to be expounded upon. They don’t develop and they don’t really grow as people. They’re more or less the same girls from start to finish. This is, again, a perfectly acceptable direction given the format of the anime and its overall goals. Since the characters are formatted as such, there isn’t a whole lot to say once more, at least with the main cast. Shino still wants to be an interpreter, Alice is continually mistaken for an elementary school student, Karen never stops smiling, Ayaya does her best to keep the others reeled in, and Yoko manages to go along for the ride.<br />
<br />
So what is it that makes the girls so cute then? It’s already been established that the narrative does nothing for them and their individual quirks aren’t too compelling. The answer lies in something briefly mentioned earlier: character interactions. What the anime excels at is using the characters not on their own but in unison with each other, giving them the opportunity to be adorable through the relationships they share. It’s seeing the girls have fun together, and not simply being who they are by their lonesome, that provides the experience the show wants. For example, Shino loves blond hair, but it’s her doting nature and inseparable bond with Alice that brings glee to anyone who sees it. There’s Ayaya’s clearly romantic feelings and embarrassment towards Yoko that one can’t help but root for. And Karen seems to be on the same wavelength of every girl at once; she’s sporty with Yoko, serious with Ayaya, innocent with Alice, and supportive with Shino. This is just the tip of the iceberg; each girl interacts with the other main (and side) cast members in a way that not only coincides with their own traits but also feels unique within the anime. Such relative and different relationships is what gives the show the chance to branch out in as many cute areas as it can, with the result being a bombardment of elation that never ceases.<br />
<br />
It’s for this reason – the character interactions and relationships having such high importance – that makes Kuzehashi-sensei arguably the best character out of the entire cast despite being introduced just this season. She’s someone who is seeking these very relationships; she isn’t the best at establishing a connection with the people around her due to her outwardly misjudged hostility and shyness, but she tries to understand her students (Karen especially) as much as she can. But it’s a bit more than this. Kuzehashi-sensei holds a special position in regards to everyone else: she’s the “median” between the teachers and the students. With her, the audience gets to see a new outlook in regards to the interactions held, because she’s not entirely seen as a teacher by her fellow peers. Instead, due to her wanting to be more personable with the people around her, she comes off as being less of a work-buddy and mentor and more of a really good friend to the people she meets.<br />
<br />
The same reasoning can also be applied to the other new character, Honoka. She’s painted as a sort of Shino clone but for Karen, not Alice. This is mostly likely done to complete the “yuri trifecta” – Ayaya and Yoko, Shino and Alice, and now Karen and Honoka. But again, it’s not her love of golden hair and the broken Japanese-speaking girl that makes her a welcome addition, it’s her determination to create relationships with Karen and the other girls that gives her character more strength than it should have. She, too, has a special position: she’s an “outsider” looking to become friends with the rest. So with her and Kuzehashi-sensei, watching as they try to make and maintain connections with everyone else, gives them their own brand of cuteness that the anime hadn’t seen before.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
The opening theme is surprisingly catchy, with the beginning trumpet, various instruments, and quick-paced beat being fun to listen to. The lyrics are cute, the vocalists are cute, and the changing tempos are cute; it’s a piece that perfectly fits the mood of the show. The ending theme definitely feels “English,” not just in the visuals but in the jazzy composition crafted by the trumpet and tapping drum. It’s not as catchy as its starting counterpart or as cute, but the track itself still has a charm about it that remains consistent with the anime.<br />
<br />
Kinmoza 2’s remaining soundtrack is filled to the brim with whimsical pieces that are quite dainty. There are a ton of tracks in total – nearly 40 to speak of – that all sound more or less the same. “Haikei Alice Desu” feels like riding on air due to the extravagant violins and wooden flute, “Sensei To Seito” is a signature track that captures the tone of the anime wonderfully, “Kawaii No” is very simple and therefore very cute because of it, “Eigo De Kaiwa” goes more homely in its presentation, “Mata.Ae Ta Ne” is mostly piano that has a certain nostalgic presence, and “Hamabe Nite” goes more Hawaiian with the acoustic guitar and maracas. They’re nice tracks when coupled with the show but aren’t necessarily strong as standalone offerings.<br />
<br />
Voice acting for the anime is above average. Special shout-outs are deserved for Manami Tanaka as Alice and Nao Touyama as Karen for some of the best English-speaking lines in anime, Asuka Nishi as Shinobu for her cute way of talking, and Risa Taneda as Ayaya for her constant stuttering and flustering.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
I’m a big fan of “moe” in anime, and this one gives it in droves. It’s cute beyond measure and always, without fail, made me smile for nearly the entire season. I remember Shino putting herself in Alice’s luggage so she could go with her best friend making me laugh pretty hard; Ayaya daydreaming about “yuri” moments with Yoko and proceeding to get mad at her since it was “her fault” was always funny and adorable; and Kuzehashi-sensei’s peering around corners, wanting to do her best as a teacher, was very endearing to see. Speaking of Kuzehashi-sensei, she’s now one of my favorite characters in the series. Ayaya is still the best due to her unending shyness and blushing, but Kuzehashi-sensei mirrors these mannerisms all the time, too, and is a very close second.<br />
<br />
Thinking back on the season one last time, I don’t hate Yoko, Karasuma-sensei, and Honoka, but I never got as much entertainment from them as I did from the rest of the characters. Again, the connections they have with the other cast members are fun, but that’s because they’re interacting with characters that I do like as opposed to being cute by themselves. Even Yoko’s younger siblings and Shino’s older sister Isami were more comical than those three. That’s not to say they weren’t funny in their own right, they’re just less so when compared to everyone else.<br />
<br />
Hello!! Kiniro Mosaic is a nice sequel and an affable little anime that knows itself well. The adorableness is off the charts, the characters are likable, and the show never stops trying to make one smile. While there isn’t much of a story and the music is better in conjunction with the anime, these “Five Musketeers” and their other friends demonstrate that the relationships we have with the people around us bring more happiness than we will ever know.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Fine, “moe” to the max, with lots of repetition and no real purpose<br />
<br />
Animation: Good, nice art style, nice character designs, average actual animation<br />
<br />
Characters: Good, Shino, Alice, Karen, Ayaya, and Yoko return as themselves, with them and newcomers Kuzehashi-sensei and Honoka exemplifying cuteness through their relationships<br />
<br />
Sound: Fine, good OP, okay ED, okay soundtrack, above average VA work<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Good, Ayaya, Shino, and Alice are hilarious, Kuzehashi-sensei is a fantastic new addition to the cast, with Yoko and a few others not being as strong as the rest<br />
<br />
Final Score: 6/10

    Have you ever expierenced a show you can honestly call &quot;dangerously moe&quot;.<br />
Something that gives you permanent heart damage ever episode you watch?<br />
Kiniro Mosaic as a series that I find capable of this over and over<br />
<br />
It&#039;s been about 2 years since the 1st season of Kiniro Mosaic which immediatly became one of my top anime. Many a manly tear was shed on the last episode, but this is a review for it&#039;s sequel so let&#039;s dive in.<br />
<br />
Story 7/10<br />
The daily lives of our cast of 5 continues to be filled with diverse adorable hi-jinks and needs to be nothing more, it is a moe show after all.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195272">
        *barely spoilers*<br />
The closest thing comparable to conflict in this series is the last 2 eps where Alice and Karen leave Japan for a week to go to England, this of course breaks Shino&#039;s heart but is played as comedic and sweet.<br />
<br />
Art 9/10<br />
Same look from Kiniro Mosaic season 1, not much animation to speak of except for the comedic pop ups in the background on funny scenes. No exceptional settings except for England maybe. The art is still as moe as you remember.<br />
<br />
Sound 9/10<br />
The music in short is heart warming and happy as the show is in whole. I&#039;m not one for remembering anime OST but what was presented here definetly stuck out to me.<br />
Characters voices are all very fitting and cute, hearing Karen&#039;s broken Japanese or the Engrish never fails to make me happy<br />
<br />
Character 10/10<br />
Hello! Kiniro Mosaic contains a few obvious character archetypes, maybe with some quirky qualities to them, not worth going over though. Seeing them all interact together or individually is very enjoyable, and this season added some new side characters to the mix, although some don&#039;t seem to get much screen time. Still overall great<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10 <br />
The &quot;10&quot; up there is all they would let me have, but my enjoyment for this series far exceeds that. This show made me laugh out loud many times and is always reliable for bring up your mood.<br />
<br />
Overall 10/10<br />
Hello! Kiniro Mosaic is a show I always watched sparringly and hesitated in trepidation at starting the next episode, because I don&#039;t really enjoy the thought of blowing through a season I&#039;m loving ever second of. However I completely reccomend this series as in my opinion the best moe anime series. Thanks for reading

    Premise:<br />
Hello!! Kiniro Mosaic is the continuation of Kiniro Mosaic an adaptation of a popular 4-koma manga about 5 highschool girls, Shinobu, Alice, Karen, Aya and Youko, who live their life and have fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: You can&#039;t say much about the story because Kinmoza doesn&#039;t have a profound story, and it doesn’t want to make anyone think critically or deliver deep themes, it&#039;s just a &quot;cute girls do cute things&quot; show, therefore are the characters the most important aspect. But there are slight changes to the predecessor because our main cast is now in their second year of high school which means that they are all in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review391084">
        different classes now than before, that&#039;s why we see new character interactions which are the driving force of the anime. We follow the main cast going through different situations such as going to the beach, being in school or even going to the pool. Every time they do something, they end up in funny situations which are filled with jokes.<br />
On closer inspection, it is (like its predecessor) a lot of repetition in terms of jokes, gags and general comedy. Ultimately, the situations boil down to who is currently in the spotlight. The events have no meaning. Instead of the characters and what they do being a byproduct of the situations they find themselves in, the only purpose is for Shino and the gang to be as cute as possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: So what makes the girls so cute? It has already been established that the narrative does nothing for them and their individual quirks are not too convincing. The answer lies in something briefly mentioned earlier: character interactions. The anime stands out for not using the characters alone, but in unison with each other, giving them the opportunity to be charming through the relationships they share. It&#039;s important to see the girls having fun with each other and not just being who they are alone, but providing the experience that the show wants. For example, Shino loves blonde hair, but it&#039;s her inseparable bond with Alice that brings joy to everyone who sees it. There&#039;s Ayaya&#039;s clearly romantic feelings and embarrassment towards Yoko that you can&#039;t help but hope for her. And Karen seems to be on the same wavelength with every girl at the same time. She&#039;s sporty with Yoko, serious with Ayaya, innocent with Alice, and supportive with Shino. This is just the tip of the iceberg; each girl interacts with the other main (and secondary) characters in ways that not only match their own characteristics, but also feel unique in the anime.<br />
<br />
Such relative and different relationships give the series the opportunity to branch out into as many cute areas as possible, resulting in a perpetual bombardment of excitement. It is for this reason - the interactions and relationships between characters that are so important - that Kuzehashi-sensei is arguably the best character of the entire cast, even though she was only introduced this season. She is someone who seeks those very relationships. Due to her outwardly misjudged shyness, she&#039;s not the best at connecting with the surrounding people, but she tries to understand her students (especially Karen) as best she can. But there&#039;s a little more to it than that. Kuzehashi-sensei occupies a special position compared to everyone else: she is the &quot;mediator&quot; between teachers and students. With her, the audience gets a new perspective on the interactions being carried out, as she is not quite seen as a teacher by her colleagues. Instead, she is less of a colleague and mentor and more of a really good friend to the people she meets.<br />
<br />
The same reasoning can be applied to the other new character, Honoka. She was drawn as a sort of Shino clone, but for Karen, not Alice. This was probably done to complete the &quot;Yuri triumvirate&quot; - Ayaya and Yoko, Shino and Alice, and now Karen and Honoka. But again, it&#039;s not her love of blonde hair and broken Japanese-speaking girl that makes her a welcome addition. It is her determination to build relationships with Karen and the other girls that give her character more power. She also has a special position: she is an &quot;outsider&quot; who wants to make friends with the others. Watching her and Kuzehashi-sensei try to make and maintain connections with everyone else gives them their own kind of cuteness. Development which is triggered by Karen who is always trying to be friends with her until she gives in.<br />
<br />
Art: The artwork itself is very soft in its presentation. The colors don&#039;t seem intrusive or distracting to the eye, the shots are surrounded by a soft white hue, and the locations visited provide the appropriate setting - the school, Shino&#039;s room, the local hangout, etc. - without being too intrusive. In short, the show gently invites the audience to relax and simply enjoy the characters and their antics. At the same time, the show incorporates &quot;chibi&quot; techniques to make the characters less detailed, often smaller, and therefore cuter.<br />
<br />
Looking at the character designs, it&#039;s once again easy to see how much emphasis has been placed on making the girls look as cute as possible. The characters that have already been introduced return with their characteristic looks. Newcomers Kuzehashi-sensei and Honoka also stick to the cuteness factor. The actual animation, however, remains average. The anime mostly moves from one shot to the next to keep up with the fast pace of the comedy. Reactions are mostly comical expressions, actual movement is usually not too strong aside from the occasional jumping, skipping, or hugging, and even then the characters are usually just standing around. There are some particularly high-quality animation sequences, but they are so rare that they aren&#039;t really worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
Music: We see various variations of the opening with each character singing it at least once, it really fits the vibe of the show, and it sounds wonderful. Especially the beginning of the ending is just a blessing for the ears and I have never skipped it even once.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion: I recommend this second season to everyone who has watched the first and when you haven&#039;t watched the first yet, do yourself a favor and watch it.

    Welcome to Robert&#039;s Too Late Reviews! The biggest thing to note in this review is that it obviously deals with the second season of Kiniro Mosaic. I&#039;m coming from the assumption you&#039;ve seen the first season, and if you would like, check out my review on that, as I&#039;m going to reference a bit of what I said there in this review as well. Let&#039;s fly away!<br />
<br />
Story: 5<br />
The story is very much the same as last season, basically moe girls doing slice of life things, and dealing with the same issues. There&#039;s a few new wrinkles thrown in, such as the addition of a couple

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313206">
        of new characters, and sadly the loss of the first season&#039;s charming little &#039;side scenes&#039; that lasted a few seconds to a few moments to tell a somewhat plot related joke. This time we don&#039;t get the cutaways and I think the overall feel of the show is slightly lessened for it. <br />
<br />
The yuri overtones are still present, though again they are still minimized, but they&#039;re in there. Shinobu and Aya seem to be the biggest offenders at reading romantic intent in their classmates actions, the same as last season. There&#039;s not a lot of character growth to be had, but that&#039;s pretty obvious from just watching season one. The personality types stay the same, we have the blonde obsessed Shinobu, the nervous Aya, the hyperactive Karen, and so forth. <br />
<br />
The series is still charmingly cute, but make no mistake, the whole thing is covered in a *thick* layer of sugary sweetness. This time around we&#039;re seeing bigger events, such as Alice and Karen returning to England for a visit. This actually causes a bit of a plot hole that bugged me badly. Karen&#039;s family in season one is stated to have moved to Japan outright. Yet when the two Brits go home, Karen&#039;s family is mysteriously back in that country. Why would they leave Karen behind? She&#039;s not shown as living with any of the other classmates (such as Alice living with Shinobu) so who is she staying with and why did her parents up and leave her to return to England? Otherwise, it was an easy watch, going with the flow of events. <br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
The look is nearly spot on the same as last season, which is to say it looks pretty nice. The colors all work well, and the girls themselves are drawn in an interesting manner. If you liked the way season one looked, then you&#039;re set for season two. <br />
<br />
Sound: 5<br />
I ranked the sound a little lower this time around because it seemed to be more &#039;screechy&#039; to me this time. I am fully aware that high school based slice of life shows are usually filled with super high pitched teen girls, but this season strayed closer to annoying for me. The theme songs aren&#039;t anywhere as good either. They&#039;re not bad by any means, they just don&#039;t have the catchy effect season one&#039;s had.<br />
<br />
Character: 7<br />
Most of what was said last time still applies. The characters are fairly thin, but they work well enough to make the viewing enjoyable. Shinobu is still blonde crazy and nearly loses her mind when both blonde Brits go home for a week. Aya is still nervous and kind of introverted, while Youko is optimistic and fun, but not overly hyper like Karen. <br />
<br />
There are basically two new characters brought in for this season, a teacher to befriend the first season&#039;s teacher, and another high school girl that shows up to serve as Karen&#039;s best friend. The new teacher is written fairly well and appears in several episodes, giving the old teacher someone to interact with on a peer level. <br />
<br />
The problem comes with the new friend for Karen. She&#039;s not shown all that often, yet Karen comes right out and says she&#039;s her very best friend. It appears to be a somewhat sloppy attempt to balance out the cast situation from the first season. We have the established &#039;couples&#039; of Shinobu and Alice, Youko and Aya, and then Karen was kind of left in the wind. This new girl seems to be set up for Karen&#039;s interaction only. It&#039;s an acceptable idea, but was badly under used. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7<br />
I did enjoy watching, though I do believe season one is the superior version. It is by no means a bad watch at all, however. That is if you care for moe-ness and the whole slice of life genre. The show is still silly and fun, and the writers clearly tried to keep the spirit of the show alive, even if the quality dropped off a slight bit. It still didn&#039;t blow my socks off, but I never had that moment where I considered dropping it either. Just a cute little show among so many others. But there&#039;s a reason why there are so many cute shows, because when done right, cute works. Kiniro for the most part achieves this, but in a rather mundane manner. It&#039;s biggest sin is being pretty much average. <br />
<br />
Best Girl: Still Komichi Aya and her tendency to take things out of context and become incredibly embarrassed at the drop of a hat. Even so, she&#039;s a loyal and devoted friend in the group, and it&#039;s enjoyable to watch her. <br />
<br />
Obviously watch season one first, if you haven&#039;t. If it worked for you, then you&#039;ll likely like this season as well. They didn&#039;t go off and try to &#039;reinvent&#039; the show or anything like that. They stuck to the formula and the show feels like a natural extension of the previous season. It&#039;s a silly and fun little show, and there&#039;s nothing wrong with that at all. Still two thumbs up from this strange old man.

    Yessss, more fantastic episodes containing Alice, Karen, Yoko, Aya and Shinobu!<br />
<br />
 In season 2, we continue the super fun adventures of the girls, following a super episodic format so it&#039;s all self contained and very fun. The girls are super cute and absolutely adorable, I&#039;m in love with Alice, she&#039;s so pretty and fun! Shino and her blonde fetish never gets tiring. Aya and her difficulties confessing her feelings to Yoko is still extremely cute and funny. Karen and her broken Japanese continues to be some of the funniest stuff I&#039;ve ever listened to/watched/read; she&#039;s just way too much cute to handle.<br />
<br />
 I love how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review198223">
        everything is self contained and episodic, it makes watching Hello!! Kiniro Mosaic so easy and fun. Everything is relaxing and there is never any stress involved. One of the best shows to just sit down, get happy and squeeeeeee all over the place, because it&#039;ll happen over and over and over again, just squeeeeeeee!! ~~~~<br />
<br />
The English (Engrish) is amazing this series, I swear I think the seiyuu got better at speaking in English, which was a whole ton of fun to listen to.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m really glad that in the second season more characters had more screen time, seeing more people get involved with the girls was great. Kuzehashi-sensei or Kusshi-sensei was a welcomed character. The way that she had trouble expressing her feelings to the students was fantastic; always ending up staring in a mean way making all the students get back in &quot;line&quot;, totally unexpected, but the way she ends up getting more fuwa fuwa with everyone was great. <br />
<br />
 Seeing more of Karasuma-sensei was great too, she&#039;s an amazing sensei who&#039;s super kind, caring and loving too, so adorable; she could be a student and fit in with the girls no problem at all.<br />
<br />
Having Honoka get a lot more screen time this season was also great. She gave away sweets to Karen a lot during the first season, but didn&#039;t really have a role; in the second season, she still has a crush on Karen, but she gets acquainted with Shino and realize they both have blonde fetishes, it&#039;s so funny to see the both of them lose their minds thinking about blonde hair.<br />
<br />
Isami also had more screen time and even an episode dedicated to her, this was pretty fun too. We saw a bit of Isa-nee from the first season, but not enough to leave a memorable impression. She&#039;s a total sis-con and it&#039;s pretty cute, she loves Shino so much!<br />
<br />
 The art style is still one of the best that cute/moe anime can adopt. It&#039;s light, it&#039;s cute, it&#039;s easy on the eyes and the simple drawings are so nice. The character designs are ridiculously cute and the girls are all 10/10, just fantastic. Love &#039;em all, especially Alice. I didn&#039;t notice it last season, but it was very noticeable this season, the girls have those extra cute red blemishes on their knees and elbows and things, it just exudes that this is a super cute show with an adorable cast.<br />
<br />
Kiniro Mosaic and Hello!! Kiniro Mosaic is some of the best moe slice of life I have ever seen. It is extra cute, extra fun, extra squeeful and just makes me want to hug the girls so much, it&#039;s like.. &quot;Squeeeeee~~&quot;. One of the best series I&#039;ve ever seen. I hope a Season 3 is announced for 2016 or something, one more year left for the girls in high school.

    Keep in mind that this is solely my opinion and my opinion only. Also, if I don&#039;t make sense in some instances while writing this, my bad, I&#039;ll get you some orange soda to compensate. (these reviews are starting to get old and simplistic)<br />

8 on MAL is very good, and 8 seems like a fair rating to give to Kiniro Mosaic&#039;s sequel. I actually didn&#039;t know that Kiniro Mosaic had a sequel until like months later. Since I had watched the first season, I had my hopes high for this one. Although it had provided a similar basis, Kiniro Mosaic S2 had some other specialties

          <span style="display: none;" id="review341791">
        up its sleeve. Once again, short review.<br />
<br />
The basis of Kiniro Mosaic S2 is just a continuation of the gang&#039;s funny, cute, and wacky adventures (in school and outside of school), just that they are separated into different classes. Not a very interesting twist but it&#039;ll do for now. They could&#039;ve included a game changer that would&#039;ve made this anime more eye-catching and better.<br />
<br />
Once again, the art here in S2 is even better than S1 and I like it. The cute drawings and characters is what I like about Kiniro Mosaic S2. <br />
<br />
Sound is sound, not a lot to say here. The sound in S2 was decent, and the opening and ending was great. Props.<br />
<br />
The characters in Kiniro Mosaic S2 are awfully similar to those in S1. We are introduced to plenty of new characters, however, they didn&#039;t really interest me a lot because of their small amounts of screen-time. That still doesn&#039;t stop me from saying that the characters in S2 are good though. Still cute, loli size, and funny.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t enjoy S2 as much as S1 because of the basis of the story. The first season was enough for me. Two seasons might be a little bit pushy for me. If there was a big change in the story/episodes, it might have convinced me to enjoy this more.<br />
<br />
In the end, Kiniro Mosaic is still a good watch despite following in S1&#039;s footsteps. A big twist would have made this anime better. If you watched S1 of Kiniro Mosaic, I&#039;m sure you will love S2 of Kiniro Mosaic.

    You know the saying, sequels are better than prequels. And damm right they are! At least for Kiniro Mosaic. I thoroughly enjoyed the 2nd season of Kiniro Mosaic, more than the 1st season of it. It&#039;s way funnier, entertaining and relaxing. Perhaps this season or even series might be one of my favorite animes of all time! Anyways enough with the small talk, let&#039;s get on to the serious business.<br />
<br />
Story: I would say that the story is similar to that of the first season, except that they added in more characters and for some reason increased the humor level by over 9000!!!!! Loved the story,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279470">
        and even though it&#039;s not the most serious or may not be the most interesting, boi is it funny! Unfortunately one thing which I wanted to see but the anime did not show is the characters all going to England, cos hey why not the ending for both the first and this season shows the characters in England. <br />
Rating: 10/10<br />
<br />
Animation: I&#039;ll give the same rating for animation as I did with the 1st season.<br />
Rating: 8.5/10<br />
<br />
Sound/Music: For some reason, Kiniro Mosaic gets everything right with the music and background sounds. The opening and ending are both enjoyable and the background sounds are relaxing. A solid rating!<br />
Rating: 9/10<br />
<br />
Characters: Alright granted the first season I had no particular favorites, but this season I have one! And that is none other than Tsundere Aya :v. It&#039;s damm funny to see here blush and push away Yoko when she&#039;s embarrassed. On top of that, twin-tails! I mean, who doesn&#039;t like twin-tails? This season highlights more of the character&#039;s feelings, their thoughts and their interactions with other people and their friends, which in my opinion is the main factor as to why I find Hello!Kiniro Mosaic better than the first season. And it&#039;s nice to see the unbreakable bonds that the main characters have with each other! <br />
Rating: 10/10<br />
<br />
Overall, a 10/10 anime. Does it need a 3rd season? Maybe, because as mentioned earlier the endings for both the 1st and 2nd season shows the characters in England, but the anime doesn&#039;t show that, plus, I would want to see the characters in England(and not just Alice and Karen). So maybe a 3rd season about the 5 characters going to England for a holiday or something will definitely be interesting! Or maybe an ova or movie about that. But hey that&#039;s for future talk. What matters is the 2nd season and yes it is definitely a step above the first in nearly every aspect. <br />
Final rating: 10/10!

    I&#039;m gonna tell you the truth here - I started with the second season. Well, I didn&#039;t know it was the second season back then, but let me explain.<br />
<br />
The fall of 2014. I was really new to the anime community, and my first show was SAO. I cried when I first saw it. Whenever I try to rewatch it now, I wanna blea--- Hang on, that&#039;s a diffrent story, let&#039;s get back on track.<br />
I got thrown into the story of Kiniro Mosaic without a warning, but hey, I liked it. I had no clue whatsoever who any of the characters were, but I managed to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review224779">
        wrap my head around it, and ended up loving it. I fell in love with the characters, the simplistic art, everything. I laughed my way trough the whole thing, and I have to admit, I needed a pillow to bite sometimes. It is the funniest show I&#039;ve seen.  I&#039;ve watched shows that made me cry a lot, shows that made my adrenaline rush, but nothing that made me laugh like this. I honestly enjoyed both the seasons of Kiniro Mosaic more than I enjoyed YuruYuri, and let me tell you this<br />
<br />
&quot;But Karls, isn&#039;t Kiniro Mosaic a discount YuruYu-&quot;<br />
No it isn&#039;t. You&#039;re wrong. I am right. Now go to bed my child.<br />
<br />
In all seriousness, Kiniro Mosaic and Hello!! Kiniro Mosaic, are two of the best animes I have seen. And thus, I recommend this to anyone who wanna have a nice, cute, funny Slice Of Life. <br />

    Maybe I am 5 years late to the party, who knows. I appreciated the first season of Kiniro Mosaic, although probably not as much as I should have. I liked it mostly because of its originality when it comes to, for example, Christian values: a specific and uncanny attitude towards Christmas, mostly for Karasuma-sansei’s part (that I have never seen actually in media, except the catholic ones!). There was also rejection of human jealousy (Alice was doing it so well, and she struggled so hard to remain friendly when Karen came and disturbed her space!), as well as multiple forms of deepening friendship and companionship

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361490">
        among schoolgirls. I don’t know if any of creators is actually a Christian, but that anime had some particular deeper elements to draw from if you wanted search for examples to illustrate or even follow. Nonetheless, what would be a good CGDCT anime without funny scenes? The first Kinmoza had plenty of it but...<br />
<br />
The second season Hello!! Kinmoza is actually faster, cuter, smarter and better. Gags are done so well and their quality exceeds adopted cute girl anime standards over and over again. Perfect comic timing? No problem. “Lol XDDD” randomness? Count me in! Some of the jokes work great, for example the straw millionaire story reinterpreted by Alice. Or when she wanted to become a delinquent for some bizarre reasons. She is by far my favorite character out of the group. She’s as cute as it is physically possible, and she always delivers a good laugh and bunch of heart-warming moments. You just want to see the happy, lovely bullying perpetrated on her by the other girls: Shino, Youko, Isami, Ayaya and Karen. Although some of the girls remain the same as in the first season, the creators of Hello!! Kiniro Mosaic fixed Karen! And thank God! She isn’t this irritating genki foreigner anymore, she’s just as kind and precious as anyone else. There is no such thing as jealousy in this season! Shino doesn’t have to choose friends to Alice’s disadvantage, therefore Alice Cartelet stays in her comfort zone. Karen seems to be more weird and joyful, maybe on Toshino Kyouko’s (YuruYuri series) level. She uses her particular gracefulness in her frequent encounters with the new teacher, Kusshi-sensei (who cannot smile at first, and she’s very upset for that reason). Are the protagonists one-dimensional? Maybe, if you want to nitpick! This is where you find the pure chemistry among characters within the show’s short stories! World building and storytelling based on gags and jokes? Hold my beer, said the creators.<br />
<br />
Overall, I could rarely see a “cute girls doing cute things” anime being so funny, so cheerful, so fast, so clever, so crazy, yet so generic and... regular? There is nothing new here: high school, kawaii girls, slice of life formula, transfer students being transfer students. Some people don’t like when high school students behave like adults or even experienced philosophers. Here, they can dislike the main girls for being extremely childish and carefree. But you know what? This is what CGDCT really is. And Hello!! Kiniro Mosaic understands this concept unmistakably.<br />
<br />
8/10. My mouth is banana-shaped all the time. Love it!<br />
