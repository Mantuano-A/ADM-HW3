    At first glance Tokyo Mew Mew basically looks and feels like a rip-off of Sailor Moon with maids and catgirls, and for the first 15-20 episodes that’s pretty much what it is.  But a funny thing happened on my way through this series; it got surprisingly good and wonderfully addictive.  It should also be noted that my three year old daughter thinks this is the best thing in the history of television.  While I certainly wouldn’t say that’s the case, watching her sing and dance to the opening  &quot;My Sweetheart&quot; is almost too adorably cute for me to bear.<br />

The plot is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19193">
        standard Mahou Shoujo fair.  Our heroine Ichigo finds herself in the possession of unwanted, embarrassing, and often uncontrollable magical powers.  These powers involve her growing cat ears and a tail and having many feline abilities and characteristics.  She joins a group called Tokyo Mew Mew to fight against mysterious aliens who are trying to kill off the human race.  Other Mew Mews steadily join the group until it reaches five.  From here the true motivations of the villains become more defined and the episodes start to play out very much like most magical girl series do with a monster of the week which the girls must use their combined abilities to defeat.  As I mentioned earlier, it all feels just a bit too familiar and predictable in the beginning portions of the series.<br />
<br />
That all begins to change though as Tokyo Mew Mew starts to carve out its own identity.  Even the battles themselves become a bit more sophisticated and unlike many similar shows like Sailor Moon, it doesn’t always feel like I am watching the same battles recycled over and over in every episode.  While I wouldn’t say the magical action and special effects are amazing or even all that good, by the end they were far more impressive and interesting than most series of this type.<br />
<br />
What was really surprising to me was just how satisfying the romance elements of the plot played out.  Ichigo is pretty singularly focused for the most part on her main crush Aoyama, who eventually becomes her steady boyfriend.  Though this doesn’t prevent her from occasionally having conflicting feelings about other boys which given her age is not all that surprising or unexpected.  It was also nice to see that other characters were given their own relationships though some were better than others.  (One in particular was frustratingly annoying)  Ultimately the ending both for the main plot and the romance is extremely satisfying and well done.<br />
<br />
Ichigo emerges as a very good lead.  She shares many of the characteristics common with magical girls; ditzy, not overly bright, not very brave, a bit whiny, but extremely loyal to her friends and courageous when it really counts.  She grows up a lot over the course of the story and her burgeoning romance with Aoyama and her own doubts about her own feelings and his feelings for her are compelling viewing.  Though at times her personality can be a bit annoying (a lot like Usagi from Sailor Moon) but it’s impossible to dislike her.  Saying you hate Ichigo is kind of like saying you hate kittens.<br />
<br />
Aoyama is very much a background character for the first half of the series.  As the story progresses though his role with the Mew Mews and in the plot becomes more and more important.  Though I felt at times the story put some unnecessary and fairly ridiculous cockblocks in the way of his relationship with Ichigo it never reaches the levels of frustration I often feel with the romances in series like this.<br />
<br />
The remaining Mew Mew&#039;s were all a pretty good mix.  They all received enough screen time to develop their characters adequately but not too much that they took away from what was really important.  My favorite of the group was Zakuro who was a bit like an older sister or even a mother to the rest of much younger Mew Mew team.  Lettuce fulfilled to moe role on the team and I personally liked her a lot too.  Though of all the characters I really would have liked to see a bit more back story on her.  Pudding is the resident loli and while I was initially mostly annoyed by her she managed to grow on me as the series progressed.  The only one of the girls that I can’t say I really liked was Mint.  She has her moments but most of the time she just comes across as a spoiled selfish bitch.  The only male members and founders of the team, Shirogane and Akasaka are interesting and likeable.  They are initially fleshed out pretty well but seem to become less involved with the story as it reaches its conclusion.<br />
<br />
The villains also deserve some mention.  They actually have some depth to them unlike a lot of similar series.  Their actions and motives are quite evil but even so they don’t seem like evil people.  Though many of the things they do are pretty unforgiveable I think the depth of character they display and the fact that they are not all black and white is what made this series so compelling to watch.<br />
<br />
Even though some aspects of the artwork and animation are a bit dated when compared to what we are used to today, I still found Tokyo Mew Mew to be very good visually.  The character designs were cute and not too perverse or unrealistic.  Since this is Mahou Shoujo that means transformation scenes!  Thankfully these aren’t shown to us in their entirety for the whole series.  While some of the animation footage (we pretty much always seem to see Ichigo&#039;s complete transformation and battle animation) gets a bit repetitive this is primarily in the first half of the show.  When things start getting interesting towards the end and the cast is bigger the show does not waste half of its runtime showing scenes we’ve already seen 40 times before already.<br />
<br />
Where I really fell in love with this series is the music.  I mentioned how much my daughter loves this show, and that is almost totally due to the cute and entirely addictive OP and EN songs.  It’s been a little more than 2 months at the time of this writing since I finished Mew Mew, but I would say not one day has passed since that I have not heard &quot;My Sweetheart&quot; playing in the house.  It’s adorable, clever, and always brings a smile to my face.  The same goes for the EN song, particularly when coupled with the chibi goodness in the closing animation.  The voice cast gives a very strong and delightful performance.  I should warn you though, do not bother with the English dub.  It is a horrible 4Kids fuck job and an insult to the senses.  Thank goodness those no talent hacks are going out of business.  Good riddance.<br />
<br />
Those of you who enjoy magical girl series should watch this series without fail.  Additionally any of you with kids under the age of 10 or younger siblings should also take the opportunity to watch this with them.  Tokyo Mew Mew is a rare show that is just adult and serious enough to appeal to older viewers but still youthful enough to charm the little ones.  You shouldn’t miss it!<br />

    Tokyo Mew Mew tells the story of Ichigo Momomiya, a clumsy but kind girl who loves protecting the environment and who has a huge cruch on Aoyama-kun, the coolest and hottest guy in school. However, on thier first date together, Ichigo is hit with a mysterious beam of light which changes and mixes her DNA with that of a rare wild cat. Now by she is half school girl, half super hero with some embarassing feline tendancies. It&#039;s up to her to find her super hero team mates, save the world from interdimensional aliens AND keep her new boyfriend from discovering her secret!<br />
<br />
When I first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6324">
        had this anime reccomended to me online I thought I&#039;d hate it, it sounded so cheesy and girly. But actually I was instantly hooked! The jokes are funny, the tension is well excecuted and it&#039;s just fun and exciting to watch. It doesn&#039;t really drag, despite the number of episodes, however, within episodes there are a lot of repeated sequences when the girls are transforming into thier super hero alter egos. Otherwise it&#039;s all great, you&#039;ll want to watch every single episode!<br />
<br />
The artwork isn&#039;t too bad, The characters look cool and the costumes are fun. The only problem is the repetition, each character baisically has one outfit which they wear constantly. It&#039;s no big deal though. The designs for the characters are really good, their faces match their personalities well and over all the emotions are pretty nicely portrayed.<br />
<br />
On the sound frount, this is a brilliant anime, the opening theme is uber catchy, you&#039;ll find yourself humming along almost instantly, really cool lyrics and nice and uplifting. The ending theme isn&#039;t as great but somehow you fnid yourself sitting through it so as to get the &amp;quot;next time...&amp;quot; bit at the end, it&#039;s ok though. One VERY important thing: WATCH THE SUBTITLED VERSION! the american version is awful with everyone being renamed and whiney voices cutting into your brain. Seriously, the Japanese voice acting is excellent, everyone sounds awesome.<br />
<br />
The characters of Toyko Mew Mew are the really great thing about this anime. Although at fist it seems everyone just has their one trait (rich, nerdy, childish or loner) as the story progresses everyone has a deeper side to show. our heroine, Ichigo, is a girl most of us can symathyse with, unlike many leads, she&#039;s not wet blanket Mary-Sue, she&#039;s clumsy, funny and passionate, one is always pleased to see her win through. Of course I couldn&#039;t go through a character review without mentioning the greatest villain I&#039;ve ever seen in an anime! Kisshu the inter-dimensional hovering elvin alien is hilarious, flirty and evil is always a winning combination, I found myself cheering every time he made his entrance in each episode! Undoubtedly, the characters get right into your heart.<br />
<br />
Overall, this is a great anime, it has humourand action but also heart-wrenching romance and teenage angst. I&#039;d recommend it to anyone, there&#039;s something there for all of us.

    Story: The story is about a team of magical girls who have to protect the earth from aliens. For some reason these aliens only attack in places where the main characters currently are, even though the aliens want to control the whole earth. There is nothing really wrong with the story, but there is nothing special about it either.<br />
<br />
Art: The artwork looks fine, but the battles consist 90% of the old battle scenes and are VERY repetitive, especially since every character only has one attack. And the same transformation and attack scenes just get copied over and over again. I think this makes the animators

          <span style="display: none;" id="review2625">
        look very lazy.<br />
<br />
Sound: The opening isn&#039;t too good, and the ending just sucked. But luckily, you can skip them. The voices are good though, fitting and cute. The only problem is that in transformation/attack scenes they get copied too.<br />
<br />
Characters: The characters are great, and what this show is all about. They have good personalities and designs. The fact that the main characters have part animal DNA is a funny idea,  Ichigo is really cute to watch when she behaves like a cat.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: This show is rather funny, and there are a lot of laughing moments, at least when the girls aren&#039;t fighting monsters.<br />
<br />
Overall: This show is good, but all the repetition in the fights makes it really annoying sometimes. The animators should have spent more time on the fights, they should at least have animated each characters attack more that once, I mean it&#039;s not like thats to much to ask. There are 52 episodes after all.<br />
The non-fighting parts are sometimes really good though, so it you have enough patience and nothing better to watch, you should try watching this one. Doesn&#039;t that sound positive? :P

    Tokyo Mew Mew is a really awsome anime to watch.........everything about it*in my opinion* is SO awsome!i mean its story, art, sound, characters, and everything else is awsome ^^.<br />
<br />
Story:the story is about a girl who, when on a date with her crush, is zaped by a light and her DNA is merged with the DNA of a Iriomote Wildcat. Ichigo*that girl* and 4 others, Mint, Lettuce, Pudding, and Zakuro, must save the world from being takin over by the aleins, Kisshu, Taruto, and Pia. So that is pretty much the plot to it all.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation:Again its very good. How they drew everything was awsome. The animation

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1345">
        behind this show is pretty much like other anime like this one but its still one of a kind.<br />
<br />
Sound:The sound is *again*awsome. Its begining &amp;quot;My Sweet Heart&amp;quot; is so cool. Ihavent really heard the ending so you might wanna get that somewhere else ^^. Also the Mew Mew&#039;s transformations songs are pretty cool and they fit with which character they play for.<br />
<br />
Characters:The characters like have their own special personallity per character. Like Ichigo is all out sweet while Mint is a full out snob. Lettuce has a shy and sweet personallity. Pudding is this hyperactive little girl which leads to her personallity....wanting to have fun all the time. Lastly of the mews in Zakuro who has this loan wolf personallity leading to probibly why her animal is a Grey Wolf. The others just go their own way with their personallitys. ^^.<br />
<br />
Overall:This anime is one of the best i&#039;ve watched*is still watching*. Take it from me....if your in to magical girls fighting evil to save their planet from being takin over...i highly suggest you watch Tokyo Mew Mew<br />
<br />
Thx for reading....hope this helped ^^.

    ((This is for the subbed or raw Japanese version, not the dubbed version.))<br />
<br />
Tokyo Mew Mew was, basically, my first anime. It was, overall, actually a pretty good place to begin.<br />
<br />
Right then, story wise it&#039;s interesting but more in a new-spin on an old idea way; the concept of adding the environmental and animal focus to the magical girl idea was neat and I liked that some of the animals were less typical. The basic collect-the-pieces-and-destroy-the-monster plot is nice enough and pretty entertaining, and comes across as less repetitive as some could. There are some decent twists and turns, and I like one early on where

          <span style="display: none;" id="review2905">
        we get a total 180 for Lettuce. The romance is... generic, but oh well.<br />
<br />
Art wise, it&#039;s nice. I like the style, it&#039;s very much modern girly anime and it&#039;s wonderfully bright a lot of the time. It has the frilly lolita sections, the girly cafe... it&#039;s all just so girly looking, but not in a bad way. And design wise I love it- the magic-girl uniforms have something that sets them apart from most, they&#039;re a bit different, nicely designed, especially Ichigo&#039;s.<br />
<br />
Sound wise, it&#039;s fine. Decent voices... nice opening theme... obnoxiously catchy ending... Nice.<br />
<br />
I like the characters, too. They&#039;re stereotypes, but very well executed ones I think. Mint sticks out as the one that you&#039;d expect to be all rich and aloof but secretly &#039;omgLONELY&#039; but they really kind of diverted that one away. Ichigo is cute, no Mary-Sue and she feels well rounded. Pudding is cute, does the whole kid-with-responsibility thing nicely and is, well, cute. Zakuro is the least interesting, very cut out but never annoying, and Lettuce is sweet and has some development I feel.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the whole thing. Funnily enough, more the start than the end, which is odd for me, but it&#039;s a good anime to watch when you need something quite light, happy but still solid and it really is something that just cheers you up.<br />
<br />
Never, EVER watch the dub though.<br />
<br />
EVER.<br />
<br />
Whooooole &#039;nother story.

    This review may be very biased, be warned. <br />
I first watched tokyo mew mew in the summer of 2009. Back then I watched the dubbed version of this anime, and loved it. Looking back I would have to politely disagree with my past self, as the dub was horrible. However, I have come to appreciate the sub, as it is pretty good in comparison. Now on to the review. <br />
<br />
Story: 4. <br />
The story isn&#039;t as drastic or detailed as madoka magica or sailor moon or any other popular magical girl anime. It suffers from a lot of Ichigo&#039;s stupidity and overall lack of common sense,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320095">
        which can bring her into dangerous situations. However I commend it for at least being slightly unique-r than other magical girl anime. It has a theme of saving the environment, in which I haven&#039;t seen much in other magical girl anime. However a lot of the story is based off romance (which is fine if it can work accordingly) however it didn&#039;t work much in this anime. A lot of Ichigo&#039;s decisions is made off her love of her crush, often dismissing others for her crush and in return showing a bad image. Not bad, not good. So I rate it a 4.<br />
<br />
Art: 8. <br />
The aesthetic of this anime is very nice and has pretty fluid animation. It isn&#039;t the best animation but is certainly darn good. I love the usage of colours and I believe it fits perfectly with the themes of the anime. <br />
Backgrounds look fairly decent as well. <br />
<br />
Sound: 6.<br />
The songs and themes are very nice, but in compared to the dub it sounds pretty mediocre. This may be the only time I appreciate the dub, because the songs on the dub are quite good and catchy and better in comparison to the sub. The songs in the sub are good but nothing compared to the dub. <br />
<br />
Character: 6.<br />
Got to say the characters are pretty decent. Of course they have lots of room for improvement, but I must say its not the worst characters I&#039;ve come across. The characters have differing personalities correspondent to their magical ability (e.g. pudding, the monkey, has a very energetic and cheeky personality). They somewhat flesh out the characters and made me come to appreciate their backstories and ambitions. I believe it would have been better if ichigo would have been a bit more intelligent, however as I believe her idiotic personality made the show a bit harder to watch at times. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10. <br />
Despite overly critiquing this anime, I must say I am very fond of it. It was my first anime, after all. It holds much nostalgic value and I loved revisiting my childhood. I missed all these characters and came back to loving them once more. I believe the anime could be improved greatly but I love it how it is for its pure value to me in how it helped me. <br />
<br />
Overall: 10. <br />
Yes, this may come as a surprise, but Tokyo Mew Mew is very dear to my heart. I love it dearly and nothing could replace it as my top anime. Besides its major flaws I&#039;ve come to love this series with all of my heart.<br />
<br />
I highly recommend this anime if you are into magical girls anime and for a wild nostalgia trip. However with its many flaws I wouldn&#039;t recommend this to the average viewer.

    What can I say for this amazing magical girl anime?<br />
<br />
Where should I start? The story is being developed on Earth where the peace is distracted by monster attacks  and the enviroment is at stake! Two men are trying to bring peace back to the universe, Keichiro and Shirogane  are planning to restore the planet but they are no match for these monstrous and evil creations! Their only hope is to find the rest mew mew girls, bring them together and fight the evil to the core. Ichigo is a student bored of studying and living a normal life until she notices that she

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290869">
        has special abilities of a cat. She is in love with a boy and her new change is making her life difficult now. Shirogane meets her at last and the story starts when her first mission is to transform to a mew mew and fight an evil mosnter. I will say no more... you should find out!<br />
<br />
I really love the character developement in the series and their appearences are very lively and colourful! The sound effects and music are out of this world and their transformations are very special and the best in my opinion! The art is &quot;normal&quot; not so detailed but still nice and soft to the eye so its very enjoyful to watch the show!<br />
<br />
I like that it is not copying Sailor Moon at all and is following its own steps and special story. Many other magical girl anime is just a good copy of other anime and you just see a princess that she didn&#039;t know she was one and later on when she found out, starts fighting evil and stuff...<br />
<br />
 Tokyo mew mew is about enviroment, love, animals and creations! <br />
<br />
I recomend it, enjoy it!<br />

    Although this is my favorite anime, I will try to ignore that fact as I review this.<br />
<br />
So, here goes:<br />
<br />
Story: 10<br />
<br />
I think the story is great because of the villains. Mainly, Deep Blue (Diipu Buruu). He was wonderfully kept in the dark for most of the series to avoid spoilers, but when he was revealed he was almost like an X-Men villain (like Apocalypse). The overall plan of the aliens was to destroy the humans on Earth so they could take it for themselves, and, unless you watched the English dub, they had their own morals on the matter. Apparently, they were trying to &#039;reclaim&#039; the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review224086">
        Earth for their species. Their species originated on Earth. The main three aliens, Pai, Kisshu, and Taruto, were enjoyable to watch, and they seemed to care for each other very much, the only thing throwing this off was their individual loyalty strength to their species.<br />
<br />
The Mew Mews themselves were great, too. Unlike the manga, Ichigo was not the only focus. The gave character development to the other four. You even get to learn about some of their families. I did not think at any time that they were annoyingly obnoxious.<br />
<br />
Ryou and Keiichirou were mysterious and funny at the same time. Ryou was, thankfully, less perverted than he was in the Manga. The mystery of his character was well-kept, too, I think.<br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
<br />
Okay, so the art was not that great in the beginning of the show. It does get better as the story progresses (especially in the last 3 episodes). Look on the bright side! You get some great, funny in-between shots!<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
<br />
I thought the background music was okay, I mean, I even downloaded almost all of it on my computer. There are some songs I prefer over others. The actual character songs are AMAZING, though.<br />
<br />
The voice actors are some of the greatest, I believe. We have Canna Nobutoshi as Pai, and Sakaguchi Daisuke as Kisshu. They are one of the reasons I like this show so much, they fit their character roles so much!<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure I already mentioned how great they are in the story section, but I will go over all the main characters here.<br />
<br />
Ichigo; Cute and funny pink Mew Mew. She is the main character and following her in her story is very enjoyable and emotional at the same time. While she has a lot of guy problems, that is just what happens when you watch a magical girl show with romance. I completely agree with her when it comes to how she treated Kisshu (do not kill me!). I mean, I would want to avoid him, too, if he were stalking me, especially if I was in love with someone else.<br />
<br />
Kisshu; This guy drives me crazy. I do not hate him: he is hilarious, adorable, and awesome, but he can be over the top. Despite what I said before, I do like him with Ichigo, but that is only because I think Masaya (Ichigo&#039;s boyfriend) is better with someone else. Kisshu, I think, is not sure how to handle his feelings and his loyalty at the same time, but I guess that is why he gets so much sympathy from his fangirls.<br />
<br />
Masaya; He is adorable, in my opinion. He is so sweet, but the fandom seems to hate this guy. I do think he needs someone better than Ichigo, but I do like seeing how him and Ichigo react to each other in the anime. I dislike his manga counterpart (he is a little too forceful), but I will not let that ruin my thoughts on his anime version.<br />
<br />
Ryou; A mysterious guy who seems to have a love for magical girls XD I like this character. So many secrets throughout the anime, but they are all answered pretty well, I believe. He is funny, too!<br />
<br />
Minto (Mint): The blue Mew Mew. Snobby, rich, and a wonderful dancer, I ADORE this character. She is hilariously lazy, but at least she is serious about her job to save the Earth. She is one of the best written characters, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Retasu (Lettuce): The green Mew Mew. Besides Ichigo, she has the largest amount of love interests. She has a crush at the beginning of the series, she has a crush on Ryou later, she dances with Keiichirou at one point, and Pai seems to have a crush on her. Despite this, she (and Pai) is my favorite character. She is shy, but grows confidence as the show progresses, and her motherly instinct is adorable. Her love of books is awesome, too.<br />
<br />
Bu-ling (Purin; Pudding); The orange/yellow Mew Mew. She is the youngest, but she has the canon ship that everyone likes. XD Her and Taruto have a little romance, yes. She is great, in that she is surprisingly responsible and silly at the same time.<br />
<br />
Zakuro; The purple Mew Mew. She is more mysterious than Ryou; we never even learn her past! She is one of my favorite characters, though (but I like Retasu, Pai, and Minto more).<br />
<br />
Pai; The eldest of the alien trio. This guy is very serious, but, surprisingly, he smiles at the most random times in the anime, but you have to squint to see it. His loyalty to both his brothers and his species tears him apart at times, it seems, but that is one of the reasons I love this guy. Also, his crush on Retasu is the most adorable thing, in my opinion! Anyway, this character is well-written.<br />
<br />
Taruto; The youngest of the alien trio. He is very funny. He is very cute, but will try to beat you up if you ever tell him that. XD He and Bu-ling are adorable together, too.<br />
<br />
Keiichirou; Ryou&#039;s best friend, and gentlemanly chef. He is so sweet, and nice to pretty much everybody. He has some scenes where he is action-packed, too.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
<br />
I enjoyed it a lot! Only thing is Ichigo&#039;s boy-problems (Kisshu, especially), but I ignore that for the most part. However, this show is amazing, and I highly recommend it. A warning, though: there is some innuendo, but it is not as bad as the manga. Beware the last chimera anima, though. XD<br />
<br />
Overall: 10

    People should not throw Tokyo Mew Mew away at face value. Truly the show is much more complex than it seems at first, and it is honestly one of my most favorite animes. You&#039;d never expect such themes of betrayal, true love, and determination to be in a seemingly small kids show. Please give it a watch and be more accepting! <br />
<br />
The reason why I like the show so much is because of how surprisingly dark and addicting the series gets. With 5 girls running around in frilly costumes to save the day, the dark themes and heart breaking scenes are a shocker but are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265449">
        beautifully executed throughout the series. For me it made the show all the more enjoyable to watch. I connected with the characters on a personal level and even shed a few tears here and there. Even if you arent exactly a hardcore shoujo fan, I believe this show is overall an amazing watch. Though the show does start out slowly and a little contrived, try to get passed the first 12 episodes. You will be pleasently surprised with Tokyo Mew Mew&#039;s excellent character development, undeniably cute moments, and impacting values. Tokyo Mew Mew is the perfect example of the expression &quot;Don&#039;t judge a book by it&#039;s cover&quot;.

Tokyo Mew Mew was referred by a friend of mind, and she warned me that it was a pretty girly anime...well she was definitely right about that, although it was the lackluster love story, and the horrendous battles that did me in. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story is pretty noble but also pretty cheesy. I like the fact that these girls want to save the world and all.. and the fact that the bad guys use endangered species is pretty troublesome. there is also a pretty good love story, but it gets old rather quickly... icigo has a super hero alternate persona i will call strawberry, and 1st

          <span style="display: none;" id="review16119">
        off, her lover can&#039;t even see the obvious that they are the same people. also he is way too shy i don&#039;t get it.. i wish some girl like her would constantly hit on me. but he is a typical guy girls will fall for, has a cute face, is rather innocent and smart, cares about the world and saving the whales, and is somewhat shy. which, i might add is the reason most people will give a 10 on this series. The individual episodes don&#039;t always have anything to do with the main story.. except for the fact that they are bringing more world peace or something like that. But the story is decent. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Very cute art, lots of bright colors and such. Cute girls... hmm yeah the main base for the girls looks like the gingerbread house or something, rather delicious :]<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
meh, nothing special about the music, although it does has some good tracks thrown in. <br />
Oh but every single battle uses the same tracks, which i will explain in a second.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
pretty good characters here. You tend to fall for one or two of the mains (most likely strawberry and someone else) oh and yes they are named after food. I like key lime pie.. or was it lettuce...idk but she was one of the green ones. and then there&#039;s pudding, and mint, and tart, and pie... oh didn&#039;t i already use that one? <br />
well you see the idea, it is a rather immature anime. I told my dad he shuld watch some animes, and this one... well would make sure he NEVER watched another again. But strawberry and her love interest are a pretty good connection. She is pretty confident and is the leader of the girls, and loves the color pink yay!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Well, I started out kinda liking this anime, although i felt guilty for doing so. But i finally gave it up for two reasons. <br />
1: at 52 episodes the rather dull story didn&#039;t hold my interest. and the love story was good, but not my pot of tea, i like more intriguing love story&#039;s, this one is rather simple. <br />
2: Battles. <br />
I hated battles in this anime... they were HORRIBLE. <br />
every  character has their own weapon and when they go into &quot;battle mode&quot; suddenly their theme starts to play.... the SAME one every time. And you are forced to watch their minute long introduction all the time.. not only that but they only have one attack... not punches or kicks either, they just use their wand, or bow or conga clams...whatever they are... and have a little scene where they attack. shout they attack&#039;s name, get another theme song, and get the same animation again and again... then the monster dies.. or another girl uses her one attack and finishes it off... it gets tiring VERY fast. if you watch this anime i suggest you dont sit on your bed while you watch it because you are going to have to FF the battles every time..<br />
<br />
that is all.

    I thought this show was promising at first, probably because I thought it would maintain the same level of appeal that Sailor Moon had. Tokyo Mew Mew basically exhibits all the characteristics of a typical Shojo story, which alone would not have turned me away completely from the show. What kept me from finishing the show was that I couldn&#039;t care about the main characters, and the one&#039;s I did like were not developed enough. <br />
<br />
Story 7: Like I said, the story is decent. It has a few twists here and there, but nothing too surprising. I actually found some of the filler episodes entertaining

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19993">
        compared with other shows. But I definitely think it would have been better if this show was half as long. I wasn&#039;t able to sustain interest in the main plot line for 52 episodes. <br />
<br />
Art 6: The art is fine, nothing too special. Very bright colors, and pronounced lines. I think the animation fits the genre. <br />
<br />
Sound 6: The music was nothing very memorable. I did like the theme song, though. That might have been what drew me into the series, just because the theme song was so catchy. <br />
<br />
Character 4: This is one area where the show did not appeal to me. The main heroine is just a typical boy-crazed middleschooler, whose somewhat clumsy, with no other defining traits. The rest of the girls are other stereotypes: Mint, the talented, snobby one; Lettuce, the smart, shy one; Pudding, cute, though somewhat annoying; Zakuro, the antisocial, kind of edgy one. There was nothing wrong with the girl characters; just nothing about them stood out. However, the one character I could not stand was Masaya, Ichigo&#039;s love interest. He was completely bland and not a likeable characters at all in my opinion. Maybe he just seemed so boring because he was next to Ryou Shirogane and Kishu, two much more interesting male characters, who should have received more attention and development. There was an interesting twist with Masaya, which I won&#039;t reveal, but it still redeem the character for me. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 5: I didn&#039;t ultimately finish this anime because it didn&#039;t seem worth it. I was frustrated half the time because I didn&#039;t like the main character or the choices she made. Characters who seemed to have interesting personalities and back stories were not given proper development, and it was very cliche.

    Let me just say something. It’s hard to find anime legally. It’s even harder to find English dubbed anime legally. And, wouldn’t you know it, I’m one of those people that likes to make it a point to obtain my anime in both of those fashions. Sure, call me a weenie, call me an uncultured couth, but at least I have a guiltless conscience. Of course, there is one English dubbing company which I truly hate and despise. It is truly a force for evil in this universe, and while with other dubbing companies I make sure to buy their stuff (even though I’m saving

          <span style="display: none;" id="review83819">
        for college so no I can’t get the latest book of Bakuman or the complete collection of Martian Successor Nadesico even though it hurts even though it makes me grind my teeth even though….but I digress), with this company I specifically make sure to do whatever is in my power to hurt them and grind them into bankruptcy. Yes, I think you know the one. 4Kids Entertainment. God, may there be nothing left, not even ashes, once they are inevitably destroyed.<br />
<br />
But anyways, it was in this fashion of looking for ways to obliterate Britannia- I mean, 4Kids Entertainment, that I stumbled across Tokyo Mew Mew. Just so everybody knows, I am what most Western European ideals would consider completely masculine. I’m tall, relatively healthy, and I’m not sexually attracted to other men. But I actually have a sweet spot in my heart for classic Magical Girl anime due to the fact that the only anime I ever got my staunchly anti-anime sister to watch, and love, was Cardcaptor Sakura, a delightful little gem which was hacked into a barren husk of its former self by the Canadian version of 4Kids, Nelvana (God, I hate 4Kids). So since I hadn’t been able to find any new English dubbed and legal anime, I decided to watch Tokyo Mew Mew simply to chip away at 4Kids’ holding on something. Hehehehehe, God I love being morally ambiguous.<br />
<br />
So, if I were to give a simple analogy regarding what I think of Tokyo Mew Mew, I’d say it’s like the Animal Man of anime. No, there isn’t any Grant Morrison. No, there aren’t any intellectually compelling thoughts on meta-textual awareness. And no, there aren’t any yellow aliens. There is, however, a genuinely enjoyable story that spans over a long amount of chapters which manages to blend two ideas (Superpowers and Animal Rights) in a way that isn’t cheesy or seemingly trite. While I didn’t find Tokyo Mew Mew as enjoyable as Cardcaptor Sakura, that’s mostly because CCS was done by CLAMP, and CLAMP is legendary, and so of course anything that tries to do something like CLAMP will pale in comparison, simply because it isn’t CLAMP.<br />
<br />
The basic premise is as such: Ichigo Momomiya is a normal Middle School girl (Yes, one of those. Please, no gagging.), who one day, whilst on a date with her longtime crush, is bombarded by a strange energy, which gives her the power of a cat. Along with super-powers, this has the nasty side effect of making Ichigo’s behavior more and more catlike, causing cat-ears and a tail to pop up when Ichigo is excited, and making her chase mice, devour fish, etc. etc.. As the Italians would say, “Momo Miya!” Hehehehehe, you…you get it…..because….because normally it’s….it’s….yeah, okay, not funny, moving on. After becoming a cat-girl, Ichigo is approached by two scientists; Ryoo Shirogane, who constantly dresses in sexy bad-boy fashion for no explicable reason, and Keiichiroo Akasaka, who dresses like he’s an extra on the set of Hello Dolly. The scientists explain that it was they who bombarded Ichigo with the strange energy, and it was because they needed her to fight monsters created by aliens that are all named after pastry dishes and who want to invade the Earth. Oh yeah, and there are other people that can become super-heroines like Ichigo, so she needs to go find them and awaken their power. Wow, mentor figures who are actually upfront and honest about everything right at the beginning with the heroine. That’s new. But anyways, Ichigo gathers the other Mew Mews, as the super-powered girls are called, and fights the aliens and their monsters. Meanwhile, as all this goes on, everybody learns the reason why the aliens want to invade Earth: it turns out that they were the original inhabitants of Earth, but they had to leave due to environmental disasters, and they ended up on a real crapsack planet, causing them to revere and hold up the Earth and its natural beauty as a hopeful ideal which they could one day return to. However, once a group of aliens (led by Quiche, a strange little bugger who falls in love with Ichigo) did go back to Earth, they found how humans had polluted and defiled the world, and the group decided they needed to restore their original planet back to its former glory, so that they could all come back home.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you haven’t guessed already, that means that the invading aliens have to completely wipe out the humans to make this dream happen. This provides a surprisingly mature element to the show, because both sides are technically just in their motivations for fighting. One of the reasons Tokyo Mew Mew is a good show is that it shows both sides of the issue. It consistently shows at how humans have messed up the planet and at how we really should pay for our sins, but at the same time, it shows that the extreme methods of the aliens are wrong, and that extremism, even in the name of a good cause, is unwarrantable. This duality keeps Tokyo Mew Mew from becoming too preachy, and also, at the end of the day, it’s about a cat-girl and her super-powered friends fighting aliens. How cool is that? They could preach a lot of things and still make it digestible thanks to the show’s packaging.<br />
<br />
Also, another enjoyable part of Tokyo Mew Mew is, surprisingly, its length. At 52 episodes, it’s a little over twice the average length of anime shows nowadays. But these aren’t 52 episodes of 10% plot and 90% filler, oh no. These are 52 episodes of slow, detailed character progression, development, and focus. Everybody gets at least one episode where the show focuses on them and their character. Heck, even Masha, the little pink puffball who follows Ichigo around and alerts her to the presence of aliens, gets his own episode.<br />
<br />
As for the characters themselves, they’re just like the show, enjoyable. Ichigo Momomiya is a truly strong female lead. Even though she has a love interest, she’s the one who at the end of the day, saves the world and kicks serious alien butt. But she isn’t just a character that’s basically a guy in a bra. She likes cute things, she goes stupidly happy in love around her crush, Masaya Aoyoma, and she does things that you would normally expect a girl to do. What’s nice is that neither of these parts of her character is overshadowed by the other, which makes Ichigo an honestly memorable character.<br />
<br />
As for the other Mew Mews, the first one we encounter, Mint Aizawa, seems like a spoiled rich girl at first, but shows remarkable depth at surprising moments. Again, two parts of a single character which don’t overshadow the other. The next Mew Mew, Lettuce Midorikawa, doesn’t have a duality about her. But she does truly grow as the series progresses, from a shy, introverted girl, into a confidant young woman. The fourth Mew Mew, Pudding Fong, is disgustingly cute (extra emphasis on the disgustingly part), but even so, she has her moments, which make everyone glad that she’s around. As for the final Mew Mew, Zakuro Fujiwara, she’s the only one I’m a little disappointed in. We never really find out much about her, and her character remains as an enigma who knows something everyone else doesn’t. And yet, for some strange reason, this works. It normally wouldn’t, but it does.<br />
<br />
I’d go on about the other characters, but this is a review, not an encyclopedia article. If you want more info, go to Wikipedia, or even better, go and actually watch the show. Yes, there are several unexplained plot holes. Yes, there are names like Mint, Lettuce, and Pudding. And yes, there are scores of fan-girls who go gaga over Quiche-Ichigo even though Quiche was NEVER INTENDED TO BE A SERIOUS LOVE INTEREST (Yeah, you hear that, fan-girls? That’s the truth! The cold, hard truth which you can never accept! Get over it!) But in the end, Tokyo Mew Mew is truly worth watching all 52 episodes, and so it is without any reservation that I recommend it highly to you.

    This is oft&#039; suggested with Sailor Moon. So naturally as a die-hard Sailor Moon fan, I had to watch it. <br />
<br />
The first 10 episodes I found to be kind of a bore, yet interesting enough to keep me hooked. I was wondering why on earth anyone would suggest this for Sailor Moon fans. Yes, it&#039;s magical girl but it&#039;s target audience is a little younger than the Sailor Moon crowd...Only from Episodes 11-12 it got good. <br />
<br />
It becomes rather more serious than a whimsical kids magical girl anime. My attitude went from &#039;oh man! there&#039;s 52 episodes of this!&#039; to &#039;Oh my god! there&#039;s only

          <span style="display: none;" id="review202864">
        13 episodes left! why?!&#039; <br />
<br />
Story: Starts out pretty generic but I feel as it progresses it really starts to hold its own as it introduces some complexities later on, though I&#039;d have liked to seen more time gone into these aspects.<br />
<br />
Art: Pretty good. I especially liked episodes 26/27 I think, some extra effort went into those episodes. Love Quiche&#039;s character design.<br />
<br />
Sound: Didn&#039;t like the songs at first but they&#039;re dead catchy and actually pretty good. &#039;IT&#039;S SHOW TIME!&#039;<br />
Ace V.A&#039;s<br />
<br />
Characters: All pretty good. I feel one of the main guys faded into the background once the other took the limelight and so he was just kinda there. And one of the main team of girls I didn&#039;t like. Not entirely sure why but I just didn&#039;t care for her. Other than that all pretty good and their personalties really grow together once they&#039;re a team.<br />
<br />
So if you&#039;re going to give this a go, reserve judgement for a while.

    This is actually one of the first anime I ever watched and was the anime that got me started watching anime, so I may be a bit biased here, I apologize. I&#039;ve seen this anime a grand total of five times pretty much all the way through. I skipped a few filler episodes, though. So I guess you could say this is my favorite animes of all time, I used to know the opening by heart because I thought I wasn&#039;t aloud to skip it. I was a weird kid. I should also say that I&#039;ve read the manga several times as well and this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review253350">
        anime is very accurate, some of the names were changed a bit, and there was a lot of filler.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the story is rather simple, but can get a bit complicated depending on what your definition of complicated is. It&#039;s basically a middle school love story, but gets ran over by a huge truck full of magical girl magic and sexually harassing aliens. So, yeah, it&#039;s a bit weird, but not unusual for a magical girl anime. I love the story, obviously, and I actually like most of the filler episodes because I think it gave the characters more depth. There were a few occasions the anime got a bit too cliche and I felt the battle scenes were sometimes pointless or lackluster, but other than that, no problems at all.<br />
<br />
The art is the typical old-ish anime look, since it was produced in 2002. The one thing I didn&#039;t much care for was the repetive attack scenes. The fact I still have all of them ingrained in my memory forever, kinda proves that point. Honestly, I could do every single transformation and attack perfectly, well as perfectly as my unfit self can do. I used to do them when I was in my room when I was younger when I was really bored. Ah, memories. Also, I&#039;ve always loved the openings and ending, even if they were a bit cliche with the silly glamour shots, it honestly makes the anime more charming in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Anyway, sound was awesome. Voice acting is great, so is the opening and ending theme, again, I used to have the opening memorized start to finish.<br />
<br />
The characters, oh my the characters. I LOVE the characters, I could honestly say that the characters are the best part of the show. They&#039;re all dynamic and have such wonderful personalities and they can all be relatable to anyone. From the quiet, reserved character or the rich, misunderstood character. This anime pretty much has any character trope, that&#039;s excuted so nicely.<br />
<br />
If it isn&#039;t obvious enough how much I&#039;ve enjoyed this anime, I don&#039;t know how else to express it. This anime is so awesome and this is coming from a person who doesn&#039;t typically like the cutesy love story. I highly recommend this to young people or maybe anyone  who just want a fun anime, full of laughs, tears, and cheesy moments.

    ...Too pink and too girly. I can&#039;t even pass the whole 1st episode of it. I&#039;m not saying that I&#039;m a cat hater, it&#039;s just too girly...and also annoying. Has the most pathetic storyline (on my opinion).<br />
<br />
Story: 3<br />
I HATE THE FREAKING STORY SO MUCH. It&#039;s very pathetic, I know. This annoying protagonist is the most annoying character I&#039;ve ever seen, besides Yuuki (from Vampire Knight.). The story is about the main heroine had a cat DNA- no, that&#039;s just...weird and freaky. I mean, what the hell?<br />

Yes...because of the super annoying characters, and stupid storyline. End of the review.<br />

Yup....I like the sound and art. Hate the characters and storyline. And my enjoyment is very low on this anime.

    First off, I would like to say, I enjoyed it. It had great songs, good plot twists, and just has a good feel. There are some down sides to this anime though. Even though I didn’t find it annoying too much, I can see someone getting annoyed with the transformations of the girls. Also, the episodes tend to get very tedious at some points.<br />
<br />
The opening and ending got me wanting more in the anime and had me watch more of it. The sad part is, though, that they only have one opening and ending for 52 episodes! At the end, I still did enjoy them,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review28562">
        just not as much. One nice little touch though was that they had different intros before the opening according to the story. Also, they did change the visuals to the opening but were very minor. <br />
<br />
Many people say that the music in Tokyo Mew Mew is good, and I would agree. There always is a song that fit the mood very well to what was going on. From very touching scenes, to exciting action pact parts, there was always a song that you can enjoy. I still will just listen to the music even without the touching or action filled parts just because they are so good.<br />
I will say one thing to those who plan or are watching Tokyo Mew Mew, if you ever want to quit, don’t. At times, it can get very tedious every episode being very similar. Just pull through because it will get better later. Also, the transformations of the girls could get annoying. I think they did nicely by not showing the whole, long transformation every time. They did well on cutting some things out, so it just shows that they transformed.<br />
<br />
Overall, this anime was pretty good. It can get tedious, but it is enjoyable. The plot may seem bland at the beginning, but it does thicken as it goes on. So, this anime isn’t the best, but there are many good points to it. <br />

    I loved Tokyo Mew Mew since I was probably 10 way before I even knew what anime was.   I discovered this show by watching the edited dub version that fans seem to loath known as Mew Mew Power.   I don&#039;t care what haters say.   I really enjoyed the dubbed version more than the subbed and I always hope that one day I&#039;ll wake up on a Saturday morning to find that one of my favorite childhood memories will return.   This anime is the very reason why Magical girl anime have become my favorite genre.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The story is about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236220">
        a girl who gains powers to transform into a magical cat girl to fight aliens and find other girls who have similar abilities.   I really enjoy the story.    But there are alot of filler episodes.   The story has a lot of comedy, romance, action, and a few weird surprises.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
I don&#039;t have much to say about the art style in this anime.   I&#039;m not an art style expert.   I think it&#039;s really pretty.   I always preferred the art styles in anime from the late 90&#039;s to early 2000&#039;s.<br />
<br />
Sound <br />
To be honest, I am not a huge fan of the music in the subbed version of the series.   I prefer the music from the dub.   I used to go on YouTube and replay the dubbed theme song over and over again.    When I watch the subbed version, I still enjoy listening to the opening My Sweet Heart.   If I don&#039;t like the opening of an anime I usually skip it.<br />
<br />
Character <br />
My favorite thing about this anime is the characters.   They are not just magical girls.   They are animal themed magical girls.    My favorite character is Ichigo because of my obsession with cats.    Each girl on the mew mew team has their own unique personalities.   Ichigo is the normal school girl trying to get her crush to like her.   Minto is a snobby rich girl who would rather sit around and drink tea instead of working.   Lettuce is the smart girl who tried to get people to like her by doing other people&#039;s homework.   Pudding is the youngest member She has to take care of her younger siblings by herself.   She puts on her own little circus acts to try and make money.   And lastly there is Zakuro who is a famous superstar who Minto looks up to.   There are lots of other characters to get attached to as well.  <br />
<br />
I overall enjoy this anime sub or dubbed.   I&#039;ve probably watched this anime the whole way through maybe 3 or 4 times and I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll watch it again in the future.<br />
<br />
Overall I highly recommend this anime to anyone who loves either Magical girl anime or characters with animal ears.  Or even fans who like aliens in their anime.

    **I use TMM to represent Tokyo Mew Mew in this review**<br />
<br />
I honestly don&#039;t understand why I loved Tokyo Mew Mew so much. <br />
<br />
When I was looking for a new series to start, I was craving for something like Sailor Moon.  And boy let me tell you, TMM actually felt like it hit the spot. <br />
At first glance I thought TMM was going to be stupid. Lmao I guess you shouldn&#039;t judge an anime by its&#039; cover.<br />
TMM&#039;s story was good! The art and sound (I thought) was good! TMM&#039;s Characters went beyond my expectations. From what I can recall, Ichigo wasn&#039;t that one &quot;dumb&quot; main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review192602">
        character, she actually made some sense. <br />
I don&#039;t know if it is just me but, I would&#039;ve liked different transformations to the characters, not only a small change to Ichigo&#039;s weapon. Besides that, I very much enjoyed TMM.<br />
I definitely will recommend TMM to people that like the Sailor Moon kind of series.  <br />
<br />
Overall rating- 7.5!<br />
(might as well round up!)

    Well, when I first heard about this anime, I thought it&#039;s not that awesome as many told me, but when I watched the first episode of it, I was hooked totally. This anime is energetic and mostly happy and joy, but there is lot of sad parts on it too. Some parts made my cry a little, especially the ending, so full of sadness and happiness too, oh that was so wonderful^^<br />
<br />
Okay and now some introduce about this anime (May contain spoilers, sorry but don&#039;t read if you don&#039;t want^^)<br />
<br />
So the story tells about Ichigo Momomiya, first she was normal school student but then at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14977">
        one day at the park, she got the DNA of Iriomote Wildcat. Second day she figured that DNA makes some changes for her normal living. Cat ears and tail will pop out if she gets too excited about something. Then the reason why she got the DNA was that there was project named Mew Mew Project and Ichigo and her friends who got DNA too, have to protect the earth from aliens, and there the story will start!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh I so loved this series... I may even watch this again someday, this is just so perfect on my mind, so best^^

    To be honest with you all, I think the reason I truly loved this anime is because it was my favorite show when I was a kid, and as such, it stuck with me. But, as a teen, I was finally able to read the original Japanese version and truly appreciate it. Of course, the hardest thing was to learn the Japanese names. <br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
This anime does have quite a compelling plot, but there were times when I felt an episode was completely unnecessary. These episodes were few and far between (only about three of them). Sometimes, I felt the show did not give enough

          <span style="display: none;" id="review153109">
        spotlight to the other characters and that the focus on Ichigo was overwhelming.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
This might be because I&#039;m only just getting into anime but I felt like it flowed well. Also, the emotion wasn&#039;t always shown properly<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
Freaking. Catchy. Songs. The reason it lost the two points is because the ending theme had patches where it sounded like they got a three year old with a sore throat to sing it. Also sometimes, the voices lacked emotion, but again this was a rare occurrence. And sometimes, the background music didn&#039;t match.<br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
Why did this lose a point. One word. Masaya. Masaya Aoyama annoyed me so much and, although I could see why Ichigo like him, he just seemed so one dimensional. He was too perfect.<br />
Ichigo annoyed me from time to time. This is probably because I felt she was on the screen to often. But she is a fun character<br />
Minto was one of my favourites. I loved the way she was kinda bitchy but she really cared about the people she was close to. Since she had a hard time making friends, she, in her own little way, was quite protective of the ones she had.<br />
Lettuce was one of those characters I saw as the reason the team didn&#039;t go to far in any direction, personality wise. She was very grounded.<br />
Pudding was easily one of the most lovable characters ever. She was full of quirks and was a little ball of energy. She was the little sister of the group and was immature and innocent and quite naive, shown later in episode 40 (i think)<br />
Zakuro was a lone wolf but was, in fact quite protective of the others.I felt like she saw them as her younger siblings. She was always on hand when they needed advice and looked out for them in a fight<br />
Kisshu. i fell in love with Kisshu almost right away. He was fun to watch, easy to love and hard to detach yourself from. Nothing more to say without spoiling<br />
Pie was so devoted to his mission that I felt bad for him. I can&#039;t say much about Pie without being a spoiler so i&#039;m gonna leave it at this. He pissed me off so much in episode 51.<br />
Taruto was great and his dynamic with pudding made hime brilliant. if those two were in the same place at the same time, I would start feeling all bubbly and prepped to laugh.<br />
I&#039;m not going to discuss Ryou or Shirogane because i felt like i could only spoil them.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, this show was worth watching. The first two episodes never really clicked with me but after that, especially after episode twenty-ish, this show really kicked off. Well worth the watch
