    Although vampires have always been quite popular in the western culture they have never been mainstream in the anime medium. There are only a few titles which have the &#039;let&#039;s kill the vampires&#039; premise, like Owari no Seraph and Hellsing, and they all have their own folklore and way to depict vampires. Now, does Sirius bring anything new to the table? Let’s find out.<br />
This review contains some spoilers.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Set in 1930, Sirius the Jaeger follows the story of Yuliy and the “Jaegers”, a vampire-hunter group which is chasing the Ark of Sirius, the plot device that gathers both sides of the conflict. As the Jaegers start

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290197">
        their race to find the mysterious item, they find out they’re not the only ones interested in the Ark, since vampires are also chasing it. Although the premise sounds really cool on paper, its execution was rather poor not only because of the extremely linear plot and uninteresting characters, but also because of the weak way everything was presented: the dreadful main character, the unexplored setting, the forgettable villains, just to name a few things.<br />
<br />
First of all, the author forgot a crucial thing about making a vampire story: that the audience actually cares about the vampires. In Sirius, they’re just boring creatures with not much detail and there’s just nothing that differentiates them from other shows that have vampires in them. The only things about the vampires that should have been explained in order to enrich the world building are unexplained so that the audience can figure them out. And even if they are given an objective –like being immortal- the vampires are presented in a very shallow way, so you won’t care when they are killed. If you want the audience to care about the enemies of your story don&#039;t just present them as one-dimensional monsters whose only trait is to kill humans.<br />
<br />
However, the main problem with Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger is that it doesn’t really do anything with its setting or characters. You have a cool group of guys that kill vampires and carry their weapons in musical instrument boxes and you don’t do anything with it? It could have worked perfectly as a rule-of-cool type of show or even as a drama, but somehow they managed to make it a typical action show with nothing new. At least the battles are great, right? Unfortunately, no. Despite being well animated, there are no tactics or strategies involved in any of the fights, it’s just a typical combat with no real way to know what each character will come up with or if they’re going to use an inventive way to take down their enemies. The only thing you know for sure is that Yuliy is somehow going to win.<br />
<br />
-MAJOR SPOILERS-<br />
<br />
Another thing I should mention is that the last episode seems completely disconnected from the rest, pulling things that were not foreshadowed or mentioned before –like the role of a Sirius saving the world and to let humanity live in peace with other races or the other sirius box that literally comes out of nowhere-. So I guess the sales are going well and P.A Works thought it would be a good idea to end the show hinting a second season.<br />
<br />
-END OF SPOILERS-<br />
<br />
Not everything is wrong with this anime, though, and it’s actually satisfying that it doesn’t try to be melodramatic or sad except for a few scenes and it always keeps its serious -no pun intended- tone, without adding unnecessary comedy. Plus, its pacing is actually bearable for the first part, since most of the chapters have a decent amount of action to keep things interesting and the plot doesn&#039;t seem as rushed as the second part, but that’s just it.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
The main character is that one we’ve seen dozens of times ever since Attack on Titan came out: I want to kill all the titans-, I mean vampires! Yeah, he is also the only one the conveniently survives the massacre of his village and conveniently gets chased by only 1 werewolf and conveniently awakens his true powers, wow! How original was that? Even if he&#039;s given some development, it feels so rushed and disconnected from his original character that it makes it laughable. He changes at the very end of the story with nothing happening in between that would make him start thinking in another way.<br />
<br />
All the secondary characters are just blank pieces of paper and serve no purpose in the story since they never have a big impact in the grand scheme of things and most of them are not even fleshed out. In a 12-episode series, you would generally expect to have at least 2 or 3 important characters on the spotlight for a couple of minutes but here no one is allowed to kill the enemies except for the main character. If the author at least bothered giving each of the Jaegers a backstory or some sort of development this wouldn&#039;t be so significant. The thing is, we don&#039;t know anything at all about them! The only member of the group which is given some screentime is Phillip and even that doesn&#039;t really tell us anything about him. The others -Dorothea and Fallon- are completely useless and are not given any sort of development.<br />
<br />
Then there’s another particular character which for practical purposes I’ll be calling the ‘stalker girl’. She is basically the generic love interest that is constantly trying to get some attention from the main guy. The stalker girl also constantly follows the main character wherever he goes (imagine if it was the other way around) and for some reason she is at least given some focus throughout the story. The funny part is… She was completely useless! She didn’t have any purpose to be in the show and things would have been exactly the same if she wasn’t there.<br />
<br />
Now about the villains… they’re just as bad as the rest of the cast. When the first episode came out and a dozen villains were introduced it was quite obvious that they would be the generic one-dimensional villains that the good guys defeat in a single episode and you wouldn’t remember their names afterwards. Also, as I mentioned before, there are a lot of things that were not explained about them. What’s the origin of vampires and why is the rest of humanity not aware of their presence if they’ve been around for so long? Not answered. What’s up with the vampires’ decease? How does it only affect some vampires and why did they think that the Ark of Sirius would save them? Not answered either.<br />
<br />
Siriusly, considering you have a boring and cliched main character, an underdeveloped cast and forgettable villains how can you root for any side or character in this show?<br />
<br />
ART AND SOUND<br />
<br />
Visually speaking, it is decent enough. The art style reminds me of other Bones shows, and especially resembles a lot to Bungo Stray Dogs (they even share the main character&#039;s voice actor). Most of the fights are, although bland, really well choreographed, the animation is fluid most of the times and the backgrounds are nothing special.<br />
<br />
The art director worked on many great titles like Gundam: The Origin and Cowboy Bebop and the one behind the sound direction was the legendary Jin Aketagawa, so you can expect quite a lot from the production values. The music in particular was actually really fitting, and the guy who composed it also produced Fate/Apocrypha and Iron-Blooded Orphans soundtrack, which are enjoyable at least. The voices are done by all well-known actors which play the same roles as they usually do (like Takehito Koyasu and Kenjirou Tsuda playing the villains) but nobody really stands out.<br />
<br />
CONCLUSION<br />
<br />
All in all, Sirius is a forgettable, shallow and generic show. It doesn’t do anything with its setting or characters and apart from the soundtrack or animation, there’s really nothing fresh or new that would make it stand out from any other vampire show. If you are looking for good vampire action go watch Hellsing Ultimate or Vampire Hunter D. The first one is more of a rule-of-cool with silly comedy while the second one holds a more dramatic tone. In any case, both shows deliver a more compelling story and at the same time have a much more interesting cast.

    Once in a while, I tend to enjoy a vampire theme show that is packed with action heroes and drama. Unfortunately, I can’t remember any series of similar nature that intrigued me from these past few years. Many of them run with recycled concepts that includes Beauty and the Beast romance tales or the same survival themes over and over again. Then came along this show called Sirius the Jaeger.<br />
<br />
It’s quite unusual for P.A. Works to jump into a show with a vampire genre. They’re mostly known for their slice of life shows and coming of age stories. Sometimes, they can pull out a surprise

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290164">
        or two like Spring 2016’s Kuromukuro. However, this isn’t mecha so you’re not going to encounter giant robots. Instead, Sirius the Jaegar deals with a time of crisis when vampires are on the loose in the city. In the year of 1930, we are introduced to a group known as the Jaegers who act as specialized hunters with a goal to exterminate vampires. The plot focuses on a young man named Yuliy with a vengeance to kill vampires after his hometown was terrorized by them.<br />
<br />
Sirius the Jaeger marks its spot very early in the show with its beautiful setting of the 1930s. The dark domain of Tokyo looks and feels like it’s a time era for revolution. In fact, the first minutes of the episode had my eyes glued just at the background setting. P.A. Works are well known for their well-polished cinematography and production quality. In this series, they didn’t disappoint with that in any way. The eerie alleyways, artistic architectures, and the old fashioned vehicles are just a few innovations to admire. Still, I think what people mostly are interested in here is the story. Vampire storytelling tends to be very niche these days that often involve in soap-opera like modern stories. For this show, it takes on a darker tale of revenge and self-discovery.<br />
<br />
In wasting no time, we discover quickly that vampires are ravenous monsters with little care about mortality. In essence, they are beings with a desire to eat and kill humans for their own desire. Some vampires in the show are more sophisticated than others but most if not all possesses a insatiable appetite. They attack a party in the first episode while Yuliy and his gang of Jaegers hunts them down. It established them as a mercenary-like group who work like professional hunters. Yuliy tracks down a vampire named Agatha and the expression on his face says it all. It immediately gave me the impression that his hate of vampire runs much deeper than just what they are. Through flashbacks, we also learn about his past and how he became the person he is today. It’s a tragic story that changes a person forever and he still seeks vengeance for his loss. Meanwhile, the vampires themselves have their own goal in the story and that’s to find a mysterious object known as the Ark of Sirius. <br />
<br />
At the heart of the show is still Yuliy. No matter how you look at it or accept him for who he is, it’s very plot driven about his character. Yuliy is bent on revenge although he also cares about his comrades and certain people in the show that he encounters. This includes a girl named Ryouko who gets involved in his affairs. While not being an official member of the Jaegers, she does learn much more about the nature of vampires and occasionally provides assistance. The series also made it obvious that she develops affections towards him although their relationship doesn’t really become a loving couple. This falls under a bit of the character cliché that I’ve seen over and over again in vampire theme shows. However, there are several other characters in the show that are worth looking into. First, there’s Williard, a man who acts as commander of the Jaegers. He genuinely cares about his comrades and the show makes it clear how far he is willing to go to make the world into a better place. Dorotha is introduced as the main female of the group. With her expertise using firearms, she provides invaluable assistance on their missions. Similar to Yuliy, we also meet Philip, who shares a hate for vampires. Fallon offers more of the muscle for the group as the Jaegars needs a balanced team to get their business done. As impressive as this cast is, don’t expect too much characterization on them. Yuliy is the one that gets the most spotlight and his character relationship with others is quite important.<br />
<br />
One of the most prominent character relationship in the series is between Yuliy and a man named Mikhail. Rather, they are actually brothers but now stands on the opposite side of each other. While Yuliy plays the role of an action hero, Mikhail follows a darker path that resulted in him becoming a vampire. As such, he is now the very embodiment of what Yuliy despises in the world. Their complicated relationship is told through meaningful dialogues, flashbacks, and how much each have changed. It sort of gave me the impression of a show called Owari no Seraph so for those who are familiar with that, this anime may be a treat for you. On the other hand, the vampire side of this series is mostly clouded in mystery. We meet characters like Yevgraf and Kershner with mysterious motives. Others like the vampire girls in the series are mostly added to bring in more action. There’s even a mad scientist named Klarwein who allied himself with vampires for his experiments. I’m also quite disappointed that one of the vampires advertised for this show  got killed off way too quickly. In retrospect, I think there’s a big gap between the antagonists of and heroes of this series in terms of presentation. And unfortunately, the vampires took the pitfall.<br />
<br />
Original series made by P.A. Works can be a bit of a hit or miss. But as I mentioned before, it’s hard not to take eyes off of the exceptional visual quality of this series. From the very first episode to the end, everything looked fluid and in style of the 1930s. Vampires are designed with a menacing look and their action speaks for themselves. Expect graphic violence to happen often in the show including blood being spilled by being bitten brutally or limps being torn off. It sells its fan service to make the vampire society look as dangerous as they can be. The Jaegars themselves also have distinctive looks especially for Yuliy’s trademark blue eyes and hair style. Others such as Mikhail and Yevgraf are dressed in a more gentleman-like manner as a deception of their true nature. I should also mention that characters in the series all speak in their native tone regardless of their origins. Most of them deliver their personalities to the bone. Similarly, the theme songs in the show adds a feeling of dark melodrama with and unsettling mood. <br />
<br />
I think in the end, Sirius the Jaegar is a show that took on the vampire theme and made it into an action thriller with a feeling of suspense. P.A. Works remains one of my favorite studios for not just their production quality but also being able to continuously reinvent itself. For this particular show, it managed to do that by taking on a darker side of storytelling. To me, that’s a thing of beauty.

    Vampire series that are actually worth a praise are rarer than tinder users looking for serious relationship. My expectations were similar: 5/10 experience offering momentary satisfaction and some sucking. Turns out it has a story to tell, presents it with some humor and it&#039;s something bit different from the usual. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Even after 3 gigazillion different anime series about the same subject, the vampires still haven&#039;t learnt no matter who kicks their asses and how. This time our blood-sucking vampires are on rampage and give no shit about anything or anyone, baka. Lucky for us, intergalactic jazz band lands to Tokyo with their airship, and starts

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285370">
        kicking vampire butts in a way that goes beyond your wildest imaginations! Unless you have already seen the movie &#039;Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter&#039; in which case you will be entertained in the animated manner. <br />
<br />
The story is pretty bro. Our main characters are part of this vampire hunting organization which is almost like a mafia where everyone is part of the family. They go from place to another and save the day because they are real heroes and real men (/women). All of this is pretty based, of course, but its cliches are mainly presented in comedic manner, making sure viewers realize that the author is well aware that these are general tropes under these settings. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Little boys descending ropes while one handedly using a minigun. Rambo and Arnold make way, new GAR Jesus is in town and he weights like 60lbs. Another dude is probably Donatello&#039;s cousin or otherwise has mastered his art. There is also a dude who wears a monocle because he used to slaughter vampires before it was kewl. The real main character who can tell from the smell of a flower how well its roots are doing.<br />
<br />
The vampires aren&#039;t typical villains who go insane and love murder because they do. Rather,  seem to have similar thing going on among themselves as the vampire hunters have. Our characerts are also not heavily protected by plot armors and nakama powers because characters can actually die in this narrative. <br />
<br />
Production:<br />
<br />
Interesting choices exist here. The approach is rather similar to Princess Principal which had similar settings within almost the same time period. We get tons of scenery and design from the early 20th century from cars to city lights within the atmospheric towns. The art isn&#039;t amazing, but slightly above of the current medium quality. The series is not super detailed either, but some ideas have been executed in quite respectable manner, moon shots, for example. Seiyuu works aims to deliver seriousness and achieves it. The OP is also my personal favorite from this season, easily.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
This series is fun as heck. Vampires drop like it&#039;s Skrillex with bass. It&#039;s almost hard to contrabass how well Jaegar succeeds with its entertainment value. <br />

    I&#039;m usually against writing a review for a series so early on but I&#039;ve been reading some knee-jerk reactions so I wanted to offer an alternative perspective on what I think is a refreshingly great series in a very long time. Don&#039;t skip over this one.<br />
<br />
A lot of people are hating on this piece because of the whole vampire/werewolf cliche. To be somewhat candid, if you hate cliches you probably don&#039;t actually like anime. Cliches are what defines genres in this scene and it&#039;s really not indicative of a series being bad or not (although it can definitely seem that way since so many bad

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285778">
        anime use a terribly large number of cliches).<br />
<br />
Forget about that for a second and you&#039;ll find beautiful artwork, an engaging story line, great soundtracks, vibrant characters, smooth plot progression, well balanced tropes, and just an overall well coordinated anime. Now at the time of this review 4 episodes have come out so I&#039;ll definitely end up changing my final score for this anime (will almost probably drop from a 9 to an 8 in the middle and definitely drop again towards the end) and I really wish MAL would block people from reviewing anime until the whole series comes out but in any case here&#039;s my 2 cents on this in the hopes that you won&#039;t be deterred by the cliches!

    You know what we have a lack of lately? Good vampire anime. Which is a shame because vampire anime can be diverse from the typical Horror anime to a more light hearted comedy anime. Normally, vampire anime land in the former with vampires either being the main villains or just being bad asses as the main character. Thankfully, P.A works has given us a vampire anime following a group of vampire hunters hoping to wipe them all out and stop any plans that they may have. But is the anime just style or does it have substance as well? <br />
<br />
Sit back, relax and burn all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290167">
        copies of Twilight and then show the fans what a real f*****g vampire looks like as I present to you the anime review of Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger.....wait. When did they decide to change the name? Oh never mind. Lets begin shall we?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 4.5/10<br />
<br />
In this world, vampires have been manipulating humanity for a very long time, influencing events so that they can maintain a food source, like the entire Earth is just one entire farm for them. However, once people starts realising what&#039;s going on, they will retaliate. Enter the Jagers, group of vampire hunters vowed to hunt down every single vampire. One Jager, Yuliy, has a bigger reason than most since he is the last survivor of his village which was destroyed by vampires. That is until his brother, Mikhail, returns from the dead and says that the vampires are looking for their peoples&#039; greatest treasure, The Arc of Sirius. So Yuliy and the Jagers must stop their plans and kill all vampires that stand in their way to obtain The Arc of Sirius. <br />
<br />
Sounds like a pretty good base for a story right? Well, when you start watching it, yes. The show does start out good with some bad ass vampire slaying and an overarching major plot element that is building in the background. But it then starts to slow down and the momentum of this show starts to halt. Now I blame this on the fact that the story just doesn&#039;t have substance to it. There are side plots in this show that don&#039;t get developed enough to make them interesting and can make them forgettable. But these side plots could have helped make the story more dynamic and added some context to some of the characters motivations. <br />
<br />
The focus is always placed on stopping the vampires from obtaining The Arc of Sirius, but it stumbles in that area too. It lacks detail and context behind some elements in the plot that can help make the plot more interesting and dynamic to help give intrigue of what the actions of the heroes and villains could cause to the main plot of the show. I&#039;ve watched all episodes and I still have no idea what The Arc Of Sirius actually is. Instead, things just simply happen and we then move on to the next part of the story. <br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 3.5/10<br />
<br />
The shows biggest weakness is without a doubt its characters. Outside of one character, the cast of characters are just either boring, bland or just one note. Yuliy exemplifies this because he has no unique qualities. He is single minded and filled with revenge against the vampires for destroying his village. He sees his life have no purpose outside of killing vampires and when he hears about The Arc of Sirius, he realises he has a purpose in life but he must do it alone because only he can do this task and must shut out everyone. Talk about being boring and generic. When I saw that Uemura Yutto was voicing Yuliy (who also voiced Hiro from Darling in the Franxx this year, who I also thought was generic and boring), I knew that we were getting a generic character. What Yuliy says and what he does doesn&#039;t surprise or intrigue me because his motives are nothing new or unique from what I&#039;ve seen from other main characters so I get an idea what he will say and do next. <br />
<br />
This also applies to the Yagers as they are just as uninteresting as Yuily. Willard is the level headed leader of the group. Fallon is the happy and strong &quot;bro&quot; character. Dorothea is the smart but sexy female character. And Phillip is the back talking, sarcastic t**t character. The fact that I dismissed these characters with one sentence just shows how uninteresting they are. Willard is the only one that has some intrigue due to his backstory but not enough to get me interested. There is even a love interest, Ryouko, that goes nowhere. Like seriously, she has no relevance to the plot whatsoever and normally ends up being at the wrong place at the wrong time.  <br />
<br />
The only interesting character is Mikhail, Yuliy&#039;s brother. Since he became a Vampire after their village was destroyed, he essentially becomes a point of conflict with Yuliy&#039;s desire to kill all vampires. But even though he his essentially the enemy, there are hints that he might be indirectly helping Yuliy stop the vampires from obtaining The Arc of Sirius. He becomes a more intriguing character than Yuliy because you don&#039;t know where his true loyalties lie until near the end of the series. Does he want to help Yuliy or does he merely manipulate Yuliy to trust him only to betray him later on? <br />
<br />
<br />
Animation: 10/10<br />
<br />
This show&#039;s animation is fantastic. Whether it is from the art direction or the fight scenes, everything in Sirius the Yager looks superb. The 1930s setting is greatly captured here with the character and environment designs being very distinct from one another. Now, in terms of the animation in the fight scenes, it is important that the fight scenes are fluid through the animation itself or though its use of clever cinematography to capture each scene. Thankfully, P.A works capture this very well and the fights are just an enjoyment to watch every single time due to the fluidity to it all. It helps distract the viewer of the poor story and characters because it is fun just seeing them slaughter vampires and show them who&#039;s boss. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 7.5/10<br />
<br />
The OST is something that also captures the scenes but not enough to make it stand out. But unlike other shows, I know that it is there and is does help set an atmosphere and I appreciate that. Rather the sound effects were more noticeable to make it sound more realistic and add to the scenes. This especially true in the fight scenes where the clashing of weapons helps us feel the impact of each swing and clash. <br />
<br />
The opening &quot;Sirius&quot; by Kishida Kyoudan &amp; The Akeboshi Rockets is a very solid opening. Its use of silhouettes in its imagery help set a rather dark and broody atmosphere with the song being catchy enough to make the opening enjoyable to watch and listen to. The ending is again, very solid. It helps emphasise the fact that Yuliy and Mikhail were very close as brothers and had a lot of fun together before being torn apart when the vampires attacked their village. Kind of sad when you think about it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
<br />
The main problem that I have with this show above everything else is that the overall show is just....boring outside of its animation quality. It&#039;s difficult to review something that does not do anything good but not anything bad, but instead is just bland. I said earlier that does this show just have style or does it have substance? No. It is all but style and little substance. The high quality animation can only carry this show so far before its story and characters have to help carry this show but it then stumbles when this happens. It doesn&#039;t develop its plot well enough and its overall characters are just too one note and boring to make me care. I like to prioritise story and characters to look for good anime since animation and sound only enhance the anime. This show is the opposite of this and it is a shame because I wanted to enjoy this show. It looks and sounds good but unfortunately, that is all there is to it. <br />
<br />
<br />
My Personal Enjoyment: 5/10 <br />
<br />
Overall score: 6.1/10  Recommendation: Don&#039;t Bother

    Watching this series reminded me so much of spectacular vampire-supernatural series that have gone by like Hellsing Ultimate or Owari no Seraph. It&#039;s a good series through and through, and although there are many whom have milked the genres and put their own spin on it (only to fail badly), Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger offers something up its sleeve to the point of being captivating, and yet being so underrated.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Similar to series like Princess Principal for the old 20th Century London-esque time period, we have the usual Van Helsing or Constantine type of shows, where said person arrives in some place that is chock-full of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290172">
        vampires to hunt, then meet up with people (presumably the Japanese government) that liaise to do and deal the same treatment: investigate, plan, seek, kill and destroy the source. That&#039;s what Yuily and his team of vampire exterminators are here for this purpose.<br />
<br />
For Yuliy, it&#039;s a fight that has been overbearing since his childhood days: The village of Dogville, the people residing there may look normal, but with Yuliy being the last of its kind as Sirius, there presents an unescapable fate with what is the triggering catalyst: &quot;The Arc of Sirius&quot;, a ball-shaped item of powers unimaginable meant to keep both Jaegers and vampires away that could reshape humanity according to the user&#039;s wish. This is protected by Yuily&#039;s father, in preparation for the future to come, and for both survivors of the massacre, Mikhail (older brother) and Yuliy (younger brother) must both protect at all costs. Midway, the unexpected betrayal ensues that Mikhail changed sides to help the vampires (with Yevgraf), presumably to keep his life intact from protecting Yuliy from the vampires. With that in mind, Yuliy has a number on his shoulders to not just fend off vampires alone, but to awaken his brother back to his senses.<br />
<br />
For such a story, it&#039;s refreshing to have an omage to certain series and the tried-and-true methods past. However, you&#039;re gonna have to plunder through boring and slow parts (say for the majority of the series), but when it picks up steam, that&#039;s when the story gets more interesting and engaging with the ever-so-constant build-up towards the end.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
The &quot;Jaeger&quot; team: Yuliy, Dorothea, Philip, Professor Williard + the side counterparts (Fallon etc.)<br />
A merciless band of vampire slayers crafted from their usual expertise, I must say that these characters, as fun as there is to watch their every move, they give the sense that for all their strengths and weaknesses, they balance well together, making up for the subtle differences which testifies their skills to a T. And if you can tell from the usual cliche of a team of men and a woman, where the female is the damsel in distress? Sorry, but that ain&#039;t the case as Dorothea is a skilled shooter herself, firm and able to be trusted with much. <br />
<br />
The commoner team: Ryouko, Hideomi (and I know I&#039;ve missed a few others)<br />
For once, I thought that her love obsession with Yuliy was just for show...but for her to follow Yuliy along with his plan is underwhelming to say the least. At most, she&#039;s just there for story exposition to make Yuliy&#039;s life a bit more interesting, but other than that, a filler character. At least there are people in the Japanese government would be concerned<br />
<br />
The vampire team: Yevgraf, the vampire Twins (vaguely shown), Kershner, Klarwein, Mikhail (through blood pact), the catalyst Agatha<br />
Yevgraf is the epitmony of evil: the Devil incarnate himself. Awaiting the Arc of Sirius that has been laid dormant for the vampires for an insane amount of time, he does not stop at anything to achieve his ambitions, at the expense of others. The fearsome enemy who uses a blood pact to hold those who has been resurrected as vampires, and then sees them as a tool to help aid in his efforts. Kershner is no different, except that he sees it as being Yevgraf&#039;s strategist and most capable helpline to him. Same issues and characteristics with Klarwein, the insane experimentalist (equal to Back to the Future&#039;s Doc Brown). All are committed to seeing Yevgraf&#039;s vision happen, with the side-effects of being tools just for the moment.<br />
<br />
An overall (almost) well-rounded character lineup, but the problem of being one-dimensional is truly the weakest connection here.<br />
<br />
Art and animation:<br />
Whenever P.A. Works are down for almost any anime, I&#039;m a hardcore fan for whatever shows they make for their beautiful artwork and great animation, and Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger doesn&#039;t disappoint. Since it&#039;s an action-oriented show, what better way to call forth a director who handles good action, and that name is Masahiro Andou, known for his works on Fullmetal Alchemist, Ghost in the Shell and more.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that this series is a major departure from their usual SoL or coming-of-age of works past, but what&#039;s best to know is that everything about it is left intact, and is safe to say that this series stands out because of impressive art and animation. Good game and a job well done.<br />
<br />
Music:<br />
Damn, yet another area where the series nailed it to perfection. The OST is a spectacular pickup just for the series alone. Both the OP and ED helped set the pace for the series to follow, shadowing the events that lie ahead for everyone (especially Yuliy and Mikhail), and is a blast listening to. As with any action series, the SFX really gets loud under load so much so that it causes some distortion and causes a major distraction sometimes. It&#039;s noticeable, yet it feels just about any other action anime would be at its best caliber.<br />
<br />
Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger is quite the production, but production itself can&#039;t tell the whole story, and that&#039;s where the series&#039; Achilles Heel start to show up: The slow and methodical story along with the characters, emotionless and only care about their field of range (or mission). After being burnt by so many vampire series, I&#039;d say this is at a level where it&#039;s neither good nor bad, but the hopes of knowing whatever the heck is going on here is least to say the best. Good try, but one could hope there&#039;s improvements to be made. Recommendations though? Just purely for action alone.

    well if you a fan of Vampires and werewolfes is sure a nice ride too catch <br />
and i really will keep watching but still, somehow it feels like it can make so much more of itself and it doesnt. Soo many things going on on top but no one realy explaining details here at all what people would be interested ... like the think how mikhail packstory and stuff you get just always the side of the yeagers but not what the vamps are about and their reasons -- really angers me .<br />
and also really bad = ui watched the 4th ep yesterday and have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285455">
        too say come on <br />
finnaly a little action and than the ep is over wtf i mean from a ep with 24 mins i enjoyed the last 7 mins soo not really satisfied since it really could make soo much of this show but it seems the love is missing totally in it. <br />
still love the art/ seiyuus and ost + hope also the story gets more thrilling from now on

    - Story -<br />
Seems like a fairly standard story involving different factions, the main two being the Jaegers and the Vampires. As of episode 4, the pacing feels a little slow for my taste. Most of the story elements are all things that we have seen before in other anime, and they are told in a very familiar way, as well.<br />
<br />
- Art / Animation -<br />
Very solid and consistent so far. The fight scenes are 90% the reason why I&#039;m still watching this.<br />
<br />
- Sound -<br />
Sound is great, especially during fight scenes. No complaints here.<br />
<br />
- Character - <br />
This is where the anime fails for me. In the first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285695">
        episode, we are introduced to Ryoko, a character that falls in love with the MC (not sure why). Her character feels completely useless to the story and she does not seem to serve any purpose other than the writers wanting to shove an unnecessary love story down our throats. She is given way more screen time than she deserves, screen time that could have been used to develop other interesting characters (i.e. the MC or the Jaegers). <br />
<br />
To be fair, she is the character that is most removed from any of the conflict in the show, therefore offering us a unique perspective. Unfortunately, her perspective is boring af, she is simply uninteresting and irritating. IMO, some of her actions are irrational and make little sense for a girl her age, and make her character even more insufferable. <br />
<br />
Because they are giving her a fair amount of screen time, I believe they are planning some type of arc for her trash character. Which is a shame, because I just don&#039;t see it paying off, and I would have liked to learn more about the other characters.<br />
<br />
- Enjoyment -<br />
As you can probably tell so far, I really enjoy the fight scenes, they are certainly the highlight of this show for me. However, the slow pacing, partially due to the writers giving a shitty useless character too much screen time, is really making my viewing experience unenjoyable. <br />
<br />
- Overall -<br />
Story feels unoriginal, but not too cliched or tropey. <br />
Animation and fight scenes are great, so far.<br />
Ryoko is a shit character and I hope she dies. <br />
<br />
TLDR<br />
Would have been a perfectly fine - good anime if it weren&#039;t for a POS character.<br />
<br />

    This anime confuses me so much.<br />
<br />
As some others have pointed out, it&#039;s rare for PA Works to go into this kind of action, thriller anime.<br />
<br />
It started out brilliant. The first few episodes were clever. It made no shounen anime-like pitfalls, no cringes, and very clever directing, full of unexpected and interesting cuts. I was sure that this would be a strong runner for the best anime of the season.<br />
<br />
But from this anime, I realize a lot of series could be measured using a two-number metric. The first number is the episode where you cringe for the first time. The second number is the episode where

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290681">
        you feel like everything is falling apart; the art quality is no longer brilliant, the directing is no longer interesting, the plot has succumbed to cliches and boring tropes, the characters no longer have a distinct shine.<br />
<br />
For me, for this anime, these two numbers were 7 and 10.

    Oh Lord, where do I begin with this anime.<br />
<br />
First things first, I have a bit of a weak spot for trashy vampire animes. I&#039;d had my eye on this one for a while and finally decided to boot it up on Netflix to play in the background while I worked. I was a bit concerned at first that I might miss parts of the plot, but...yeah...I&#039;ll get to that.<br />
<br />
So Sirius the Jaeger is basically another Vampire vs Werewolves show with a magical macguffin that one side wants to use to have ultimate power, blah, blah. It&#039;s far from groundbreaking, but that&#039;s part of the fun.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304695">
        The first few episodes are really good and fun to watch and I binged all of the way to episode ten without hesitation. <br />
<br />
When it&#039;s good, this show is on a potential par to shows like FMA (some arcs of it really reminded me of FMA). When it&#039;s bad, it&#039;s a mess, and for the most part it&#039;s a mess.<br />
<br />
Sirius the Jaeger suffers from SEVERE pacing issues and a lot of that comes down to its 12 episode run time. The story line, world and characters simply don&#039;t get the time, love and attention they need, except for Sirius, which again, I&#039;ll come to later. In one scene, it&#039;s revealed that there&#039;s conflict between two of the main characters because of something very bad that happened in the past (trying to avoid spoilers), but it&#039;s not really touched on ever again. Early on there&#039;s a plotline with a doctor that reminded me of the Tucker arc in FMA, where the doctor character lives with his cute daughter and is doing desperate experiments. It&#039;s a really interesting arc and given a good deal of gravitas...but soon afterwards that plotline is quite literally dropped and when we hear about it again it&#039;s played up for a weird kind of comic relief by a villain who literally falls down a cliff face after what might as well be a five second fight and is never heard from again. Like...what?? Discount Shou Tucker didn&#039;t die for this level of disrespect. Even the final battle falls flat to the point of being funny because there is no build up or tension.<br />
<br />
The pacing also causes issues with continuity. One character basically leaves home and their family follow them (to ANOTHER country I might add), only for them to come back a couple of episodes later like yup, I was being young and stupid I&#039;ll be good now...and it&#039;s literally NEVER commented on or addressed. Did the family ever find out? Are they still randomly stuck overseas? Are they still looking for them?<br />
<br />
We never really find out much about the mysterious order that Sirius and the others belong to. Heck, we don&#039;t even find out much about the Ark, which is the core of the plot. I got all of the way to the end of episode 12 without really understanding what it was beyond the fact that the Vampires shouldn&#039;t get it because That Would Be Bad.<br />
<br />
The only character who gets a decent character arc is Sirius, which I don&#039;t mind because he is semi decent as an anime protagonist for the first half of the show. By the second half, the storyline about his brother and the Ark and his tribe borders on contrived and at the end I was pretty bored of him because he fell into almost every protag cliche in the book. Run away to deal with things on your own even though it just...DEFIES logic? Check. Keep the valuable object on your person even though you KNOW you&#039;re going to end up in a fight soon and it&#039;s probably going to get stolen? Check. The final episode has a very, very emotionally charged scene, but it falls completely flat because of the terrible pacing.<br />
<br />
So in summary, this show isn&#039;t awful, but it could have been so much more. It&#039;s fun to watch, but that&#039;s about it. It&#039;s not going to leave you thinking afterwards, but it will leave you wanting more (if that makes sense).<br />
<br />
End note: are his tribe supposed to be Inuit? Because if so that&#039;s HILARIOUS... inuit...inu...they&#039;re werewolves...<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll let myself out

    This is a vampire action anime with a nice setting of the 1930s, one of the anime&#039;s strongest points is the overall atmosphere of the pre world war 2 ambience which is embedded splendidly into the animation of the show.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
The story is average at best and it is out of place for the most part, it felt like some subplots were a lot more interesting than the actual main plot. The first few episodes start on a good note but around episode 7 everything seems to get random and weird in a bad way. Everything gets weirdly rushed with little to no explanation of most

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401398">
        plot elements. There is no build up for anything after the first few episodes where there were some actual extremely enjoyable and strong plot lines but that build up is completely gone towards the end and it becomes dull, boring and rushed.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
The main character is the typical &#039;&#039;I want to kill all bad guys cause they killed/destroyed my family/village&#039;&#039; but it had some nice development that could have mattered if the other plot points were strong and connected but nah.<br />
<br />
All the other characters are completely empty, Supporting characters and villains are both tedious. This anime has probably the most forgettable villains ever, I don&#039;t think i even remember their appearance 2 days after being done with the show.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
<br />
This is a generic show that has poor character development and repeated plot, but it is enjoyable if you like the setting and atmosphere, that is the strong point of the anime and it can get you hooked up until the end without getting bored to death listening to side characters and villains.

    I am confused by the reviews that I’ve been reading. I have never considered to write a review until now. I feel like this show needs to get the defending it deserves. <br />
<br />
No, the anime isn’t perfect. The show pacing is a little rushed and there were times where the main characters revealed something or made some sort of revelation that got me thinking, “huh already?”. They definitely could have drawn some things out more, but it didn’t take away any of the enjoyment out of the show for me. The anime also doesn’t shy away from blood (lots of vampire sucking action going on)

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310443">
        and it delves into darker themes. If you are a little squeamish and are looking for something lighter hearted, you should probably avoid this one. <br />
<br />
However<br />
The plot is interesting, the artwork is BEAUTIFUL, the sound (there honestly isn’t much music throughout the series, and I’m that beach who skips the intro and credits so I wouldn’t know if those songs are any good), and the character development seemed well done and typical of most anime. At first, I was worried that the main character was going to be emotionless and robotic throughout the series. However, it is soon revealed why he is the way he is and the reveal is presented in a way that makes the viewer root for him. <br />
Throughout the series there are some unexpected plot twists. I found myself never really knowing where the show was going to take me. I binged the first couple of episodes because I wanted to know what the relationship was between the reporter, military, vampires, gangs, and shipping companies had to do with one another. The creators also took the cliched trope of vampire vs. werewolf and put their own creative twist to it.<br />
<br />
Overall the show has been enjoyable, and I hope anyone who reads this ignores the other reviews and give this anime a shot. <br />

    Let me preface this by saying if you liked the films Van Helsing or Interview with A Vampire, this shows premise will entice you. But be warned that there is an element in this show that, at least for me broke my enjoyment to where it became unwatchable.<br />
<br />
Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger has a lot of promise, but at least for me it was bogged down by the one aspect of anime that can make or break a show; the romance element.<br />
<br />
 Character is the lifeblood of a visual medium as we the audience have no other means to immerse ourselves in the world we are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review286320">
        presented in than through the characters presented. For the most part, the main cast look promising with every flavor of character type you usually run into in action anime. However, what goodwill I have for the story stops the minute the designated romance character enters stage left. You will know her when you see her, trust me.<br />
<br />
From the minute this character shows up and every scene that follows with her she annoys. She feels like less a character and more a device set up solely for the purpose of being with the main character. You just know the story will bend to the will of the writers insistence on her importance and her being with the main character, and that is the saddest part.<br />
<br />
Now of course, I could be wrong about all of this. However, from the 5 episodes I watched, it became increasingly more plausible that the story would suffer with her inclusion. <br />
<br />
Just a warning to anyone wishing to actually watch an enjoyable anime and not just self insert like this is a visual novel.<br />
<br />
Animation: 5/5<br />
Music:4/5<br />
Enjoyment: Groanworthy/5<br />
<br />

    Sirius the Cringe Beast Review (Minor Spoilers You Won&#039;t Really Care About)<br />
<br />
I think the most analogous scene to summarize the whole of this series can be found halfway through the end of its final episode. In that scene our main character says this, &quot;I know what to do, I&#039;ve finally found my path&quot; and he is then immediately punched straight in the face and sent plummeting into the depths of the Atlantic fucking ocean. Visually, this is a pretty great looking show, the lighting effects and fight scenes can be pretty entertaining, but it is also somewhat inconsistent with quite a few instances of comically

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298312">
        janky animation in less action-oriented scenes.<br />
<br />
The main cast consists of a ragtag group of the most bare bones, stereotypical members of your party in literally every JRPG ever made. There&#039;s jolly buff guy with beard, special agent d cups, edgy guy with dark past, elderly mentor wearing a monocle and of course, twink, how could we forget about good ol&#039; twink? The antagonists on the other hand are stock mini bosses and minions ripped straight out of Castlevania led by possibly the most insufferable Shakespearean twat with a top hat in the history of anime.<br />
<br />
To get a good grasp on the entertainment value of this show, here&#039;s a description of a portion of its epic final battle. An insufferable twat with a top hat eats a big marble and transforms into a gargoyle with the face of Anthony Hopkins, but also somehow transforms his full suit into a bedazzled black unitard with sparkling elf shoes that somehow grow back even after you cut his legs off. Now that&#039;s anime. The first 3/4ths of the show were actually decently engaging and entertaining, but man oh man, grab yourself a couple of buddies and brews and you will have a banger of a time watching the bombastic circus fire it devolves into for the final quarter. Sirius the Jaeger is an initially average anime that evolves into such supreme trash as it goes on that I&#039;d have to classify it as a 4 out of 10, so bad it&#039;s good.

    When the first episode aired, I seriously was in awe. I found Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger attractive in the art and I was drawn to its world, eagerly waiting for a new episode each week with great expectations that were never truly met.<br />
<br />
I was struck by beautiful animation and introduced to a plot about vampires, action, fight and interesting characters. And the way the first episode ended was when I said to myself: it&#039;s perfect, what else could I ask for?<br />
<br />
[ STORY ]<br />
Well, thing is, story-wise, I don&#039;t find it engaging. It lacks depth to actually make me invested in what&#039;s going on and it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287783">
        feels to me like everything&#039;s a bit messy and thrown around here and there so the pace is weird as well as the progression of the plot which by episode 7, we still don&#039;t know a lot of. It just feels so &quot;meh&quot;.<br />
<br />
I also don&#039;t know why they try to force &quot;romance&quot; (because I don&#039;t really know what to call it) in there when it&#039;s clearly unnecessary. I&#039;d rather focus on the plot than having an annoying character serving absolutely no other purpose than being MC&#039;s forced love interest to use yet another cliché trope that I can see as being the anchor of the MC for existential purposes (considering that this whole thing is taking up from 40% to 50% of an episode...).<br />
<br />
[ ART ]<br />
The art is really good and to me, it&#039;s one of the strengths of Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger. The animation is fluid, the fights are animated well and delightful to watch and I just love the whole universe they recreated and the vibe it throws.<br />
<br />
[ SOUND ]<br />
Well, to be honest, as I write this I don&#039;t even remember what the soundtracks or the OP sound like so it sums it pretty well, I&#039;d say. Forgettable.<br />
<br />
[ CHARACTERS ]<br />
The same goes for the characters. The chara-design is very unique to each character and very enjoyable but it&#039;s a bit disappointing that we don&#039;t get to dig deeper into their stories and their personalities. It&#039;ll all on the surface and just as the plot, they lack depth.<br />
Our MC gets a good backstory though, but the way he evolves to the present day and connects with the plot doesn&#039;t do it for me (especially because they use a trope that we could easily foresee). It could have been so much better. In the early episodes, I was expecting a strong character development coming from him with which we could connect strongly but it never happened. <br />
<br />
[ ENJOYMENT &amp; OVERALL ]<br />
It&#039;s still entertaining as is but mainly because I watch this weekly. I don&#039;t think I&#039;d binge-watch the whole thing with what I&#039;ve seen so far but maybe there&#039;s still a way for this anime to repent, eh? Though I don&#039;t think so.<br />
Also, I don&#039;t really care about neither the plot nor the characters and what&#039;s happening which is a shame. I really try to connect but I just can&#039;t.

    The nature of P.A. Works is defined by the company&#039;s ability to sustain itself with primarily original works with only the odd adaptation here and there with major influence by the company itself.  And so here we&#039;re presented with &#039;Sirius the Jaeger&#039;, P.A.&#039;s take on vampires and a war against them.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
In the town of Dogville lies an ancient artifact known as the &#039;Ark of Sirius&#039;, an object filled with such insurmountable power that all major countries in the world (seemingly) wish to possess it.  It&#039;s here where we meet the last Sirius, Yuliy, and the vampire hunting Jaegers who try to uncover and thwart the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290260">
        plan of the vampires that&#039;ve set foot in Nihon land in search for the Ark for unknown reasons.<br />
<br />
Spanning a vampire defeating plot that lasts a cour, Sirius is a show set in 1930&#039;s Japan that follows many of your typical revenge plot tropes in order to sustain its story.  Yuliy, being the last surviving member of his people after they were slaughtered by vampires, sets out to &#039;KILL ALL THE VAMPIRES&#039; in order to get his vengeance.  It&#039;s a show that has a decently paced by the numbers story that doesn&#039;t try to overstep its boundaries before the conclusion.  It&#039;s because of this that I find few positives to note cause nothing about its storyline is even that memorable, yet still manages to be a decent viewing experience despite that.<br />
<br />
That being said, given how this is a P.A. Works show, the importance of the story lies in its ending, as the company&#039;s history of floundering to the finish line becomes evident the closer episode twelve reaches.  Reason being is the show just throws down reasons in front of the audience for things like like why the vampires are searching for the Ark in the first place towards the end like it fixes the innate issue.  The attempt at sympathy and explaining previously untouched details so close to the end doesn&#039;t impact things too much, but instead misses the show&#039;s overall potential as the motivations and overall storytelling could&#039;ve been drastically improved had it been revealed and built upon earlier, instead of being an &quot;Oh crap, we forgot to add some things&quot; moment that muddies the overall ending.<br />
<br />
Because of this, Sirius the Jaeger ends with the same P.A. Works standard of &#039;Good idea, bad execution&#039;, as some aspects like the Sirius as a people was one that had potential, but failed due to the show never bothering with giving them the time they needed to be fully fleshed out.  Its slower climb to the climax ultimately hurts it, which is a darn shame considering the amount of innate potential that could&#039;ve happened should the series have gotten its feet off the ground a little sooner.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Decent pacing<br />
+ Good slow buildup<br />
-  Way too fast of a climax<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Personally, I describe Yuliy as a discount first season Eren Jaeger, as our protagonist&#039;s main quirk in the series erupts from his desire to avenge his people after vampires slaughtered them all seventeen years ago.  Thankfully rage isn&#039;t his only character trait, and we instead get to see a lost puppy looking for answers for a greater majority of the series.  There honestly isn&#039;t much to say about Yuliy, as the plot is pretty much the only drive he has to even do anything.  His motivations come from the events of the story, and any decisions he makes only seem to be a natural progression that results in the show&#039;s conclusion.<br />
<br />
And this sadly is a fact that the rest of the cast faces as the show&#039;s is the only real driving motivation for them.  Any actual motivation for Yevgraf, the show&#039;s supposed antagonist, is revealed so late (episode 11) that there&#039;s almost no reason for the audience to care because of it.  Sure you get some quirkiness like banter between the Jaegers and the apparent obsession of the vampire mad scientist Klarwein, but most of that is just fluff and doesn&#039;t add anything to note aside from drawing lines in the sand to note who&#039;s on what side and add the illusion to flavor in an otherwise straightforward and kind of bland show.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+/- Entire cast is just kinda...there<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
Now, this being a P.A. Works show, I don&#039;t actually have a lot of complaints for it because of how consistent the company usually is in its production.  A few off scenes here and there did happen, but Sirius is otherwise a show that&#039;s presented in the P.A. Works style with very few negatives to really speak of.  It&#039;s crisp, there&#039;s fluidity in the action, this is one of the company&#039;s aspects that deserves its share of praise.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Aptly titled &quot;Sirius&quot;, by Kishida Kyoudan &amp; The Akeboshi Rockets is a song rock/action piece that&#039;s really grown on me to become one of my favorite openings in recent memory.  Its mix of soft and louder tones at various points in the song lend it to become something that I find worth being memorable and repeat listens to.  Again, a feat that P.A. Works is surprisingly good at achieving.  By comparison, &quot;Hoshie&quot; by sajou no hana is a more somber piece that I find isn&#039;t as memorable as its OP sister, but still has its fair share of memorable points being a song that ties more into the emotional aspects of Yuliy&#039;s existence as the last Sirius, which exemplifies the point more even if the show doesn&#039;t do much to aid it.<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
The mantra I have for P.A. Works as a whole seems to always trail back to &quot;Good ideas, bad execution&quot;.  It&#039;s happened to Charlotte, it&#039;s happened to Nagiasu, Angel Beats!, hell I&#039;ll even extend that notion to Kuromukuro despite that project&#039;s rockiness from the start.  Because of this, I came into Sirius with very cautious expectations, reminding myself that things still can and will go wrong later down the line, which was an unfortunate truth that came into being, though thankfully the crash wasn&#039;t nearly from very high up.<br />
<br />
That being said, I still found Sirius the Jaeger to still be an enjoyable viewing experience.  While I don&#039;t trust that the company will ever find its footing, it&#039;s nice to see the diversity in their works and how they still have the heart and soul to create original projects even though they don&#039;t always work out like they may have originally intended.  Many things like the lore of the Sirius and that copout of an antagonistic motivation, as well the mess that was Ryouko&#039;s sideplot (which wasn&#039;t even a necessary aspect of the show aside from cheap excuse for some romance) REALLY could&#039;ve used work, but it&#039;s still all in all a decent show that makes a good callback to original portrayals of vampires as people preying, grotesque, transformed creatures of the night.<br />
<br />
My recommendation would be to watch it if you feel inclined, as its good for a piece of non-fanservicy entertainment, but not one that can garner a lot of praise due to numerous flaws and overall lack of anything new to bring to the table.  Not much more can be said, but I&#039;m at least glad P.A. Works is taking smaller risks with their original content.  Wouldn&#039;t want another Charlotte incident, now would we?

    I&#039;ve always liked vampire anime so when this came out on Netflix I was interested. After watching this anime I felt very confused. This anime had so much going on at the same time, sometimes it was too much to keep up with. I wouldn&#039;t say that this was a bad anime, I just think its an ok anime. It was rushed and a lot to follow. I wouldn&#039;t highly recommend it but if you&#039;re just looking for something to watch this is a nice anime to try because it doesn&#039;t have to many episodes. Because of this, I give Sirius the Jaeger a 6.

    I&#039;ve had this anime on my &quot;to watch&quot; list for a bit (since I first saw the trailer actually), and seeing as my school year was finished and I didn&#039;t have much else to do, I thought I&#039;d go ahead and watch it. And my overall feeling was that the anime doesn&#039;t really live up to what the trailer seemed to promise. I mean, don&#039;t get me wrong, I enjoyed this anime to a certain extent, and the vampire hunting aspect of the trailer was clearly there, but the anime seems to be lacking a certain &quot;je ne sais quoi&quot;.<br />
<br />
The story is somewhat stable: Yuliy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310680">
        (the writers were probably going for the Russian-sounding &quot;Yury&quot;, but hey, that&#039;s just my theory) is part of a globe-trotting Vampire-exterminating outfit which is based in London. They track down a head Vampire in Shanghai, who then scuttles off to Japan in search for safety, and a mysterious artifact called the Ark of the Sirius. Hi-jinks ensue, much blood is spilled, many Vampires are ashified and many plot twists are found, but basically the rest of the story is a race against time to find said Ark, before the Vampires find it.<br />
&quot;Now, we all know what a Vampire is (hopefully), but what is a Sirius?&quot; I hear you cry. Well to be honest, the series doesn&#039;t really explain as such. They seem to be non-humans, with a rather ancient and complex culture, all the while living rather simplistically in a secluded area in (what I suppose is) the North of Japan, possibly rather close to Russia. During the whole series, the Vampires refer to them as &quot;dogs&quot; or &quot;wolves&quot;, so it could be more or less safe to assume that they&#039;re a kind of werewolf-proxy which are on the brink of extinction, but they don&#039;t really take a wolf-like form: the closest they get to that (and only a couple Sirius seem to be able to do it) is a form of berserk rage they display when in danger, or angry, which apparently can consume then if they lose control (their eyes shine Will-O&#039;The Wisp blue, and veins of the same colour appear on their skin). But this ability isn&#039;t really explained much either. Yuliy (who is a Sirius by the way) uses it a couple times, most impressively in the second episode, while fighting against a female Vampire (but that gets cut short) and even more impressively some time later while fighting against the head Vampire, but more or less stops using it completely after that. And I must admit I found that somewhat disappointing.<br />
<br />
The characters were okay, nothing to write home about (still trying to work out why a British Intelligence agent looks so much like a cowboy, but hey, Japan), there&#039;s a vague, one-sided, slightly force love interest which goes nowhere, the Vampire-hunting posse is relatively fun (with backstories which aren&#039;t fleshed out enough as far as I&#039;m concerned, but this is a 12 episode anime, so I guess time was of the essence). A few other side characters which fill gaps more or less snugly, including a lisp-less, limp-less hyperactive, slightly daft Igor with only one  pair of thumbs who&#039;s not very interesting; a twist-filled elder brother covered in scars; two loli Vampires and a Head Vampire (not the one who fled Shanghai, another one) who wants the power of the Ark for a &quot;good&quot; reason and is more or less a Dandy.<br />
<br />
The art in itself is magnificent, the &quot;beast-form&quot; of the lesser Vampires remind me quite a lot of the Vampires from the Castlevania Series (the one on Netflix), some 3-D CGI pops up from time to time but it isn&#039;t too shocking (unlike that which can be found in &quot;Giniro no Kami no Agito&quot; for example). The recurring blood splatters are sufficiently splattery, the dying animation (the ashification) of the vampires is rather well done and the overall imagery is very nice.<br />
<br />
The background music is good, but it doesn&#039;t really stick in your mind, so it&#039;s somewhat forgettable. The overall sounds are rather good as such.<br />
<br />
So yeah, over all, this anime was a rather enjoyable watch, combining shônen-style combat and plot with the darker, grittier side of Vampires, all the while being very enjoyable artistically. This anime is a good way to spend a few hours, if you have nothing else to do or if you want to sit back and relax after a hard day&#039;s work.

    Ahhh this anime frustrated me; because SO many elements were done wonderfully. But there were just some foundational things that made it a complete mess.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with the good: <br />
<br />
1. Character Design and Setting--BEAUTIFUL. All the characters are visually bright, diverse, interesting and modern despite the time period of the setting. Quite a few hotties here, and that&#039;s never a bad thing.<br />
<br />
2. Action-- FANTASTIC! From the start, it&#039;s fast-paced, engaging and there are many moments where I was literally on the edge of my seat. There&#039;s a fairly badass train scene that I watched multiple times, actually.<br />
<br />
3. Story (Kind of)--There&#039;s also some bad with this,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review306993">
        but this is the &quot;good&quot; section so let me focus. The back story in particular was very well crafted. It made me care, and I easily became invested within the main characters after a few short episodes.<br />
<br />
Now the bad:<br />
<br />
1. Story-- Waaaay too complicated and overwrought. There are literally three organizations at play (and some of them have multiple code names... I had to watch it twice to figure that piece out), and it&#039;s just too much. They could have taken out an entire organization and had the same story line. I ended up just ignoring it and focusing on the other things. I&#039;m not here for all that.<br />
<br />
2. Silly Female Character that Doesn&#039;t Belong--Need I say more? Every time she came on screen, I literally yelled, &quot;What is your purpose??&quot; It&#039;s like she accidentally wandered in from the shojo anime next door, and no one has told her where the exit is. So frustrating. But to be fair, she has guts. No one told her where the exit is, but she&#039;s doing the best she can in the meantime.<br />
<br />
3. The Ending--Sucks. They spent the entire story leading us as an audience in a particular direction, then they TOTALLY dropped the ball. Why would you do that!? And you mean to tell me that no one in this entire project saw this blatant misstep?? Nobody said, &quot;Hey guys, maybe we shouldn&#039;t end it this way?&quot; I can&#039;t understand. <br />
<br />
Overall, it was a fun watch. Ignoring the politics and complex details of the plot-- the hotties, beautiful artwork and action scenes are what drove me to finish. <br />
<br />
Do I recommend? Sure. But with caution. When they start to get weirdly and overly political, just ignore it and focus on how pretty it is.

    DONT READ THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT, THIS POST CONTAINS SPOILERS. Overall this is by far one of the most enjoyful animes I&#039;ve had in a very long time. The characters were all good, although we could have gotten a little more on the backstory on the rest of the jaegers (hopefully if there is a season 2 we will see that happen.) The setting of this anime along with the plot involving vampires really works well in my opinion and makes this anime just that more immersive and enjoyable. I was slightly let down by the ending based on the fact several

          <span style="display: none;" id="review372688">
        characters died, such as bishop and Mikhail (and tamara, but that isn&#039;t confirmed.) The ending was still satisfying none the least and proves to have a plot that could be used for a second season. I am also disappointed that they ended the last episode with tamara &quot;dying&quot; although it is not confirmed since her clothing wasn&#039;t there neither her body, so she couldn&#039;t have died from the disease or have been killed from injuries. Hopefully the particles were just snow and she is alive, considering the character has grown on me a ton, considering i thought she was very annoying with her sister at the beginning of the anime, and the fact that she and yuily both lost a sibling, can maybe cring up chemistry between them. Although that is what i hope. Overall this anime was very good, and although it does have a few cliches, an anime wouldn&#039;t be an anime or enjoyable to me without cliches. Sadly we can only hope for another season since there is no manga that this show/anime was based off of, so the creators would have to write up a new story/plot for the second season if we are to get one (and covid is most likely making it even harder to produce if they are going to make another season.) 10/10 from me, is one of if not my favorite current anime.
