    It&#039;s been 2 years since 3D Kanojo: Real Girl happened. Why does that matter  you ask? well you see, 3D Kanojo was really irritating back when it first aired, depicting certain social topics in a very infuriating way to the point of being very disrespectful: From a bad depiction of a socially akward person to manipulative romance, terrible &quot;friends&quot; and parents, stupid misunderstandings and what not. That anime tried to tell a tale of a socially awkward person and failed at it horribly, what does this have to do with Uzaki-chan wa asobitai? well, they&#039;re pretty similar, not just in the way the characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357396">
        are portrayed, but in the way that both are very irritating, and out of those two, Uzaki-chan gets the cherry on the top for being the most infuriating piece of media I&#039;ve watched in my life. Up to this day I don&#039;t get why I do this to myself, I guess it&#039;s a masochist sport, but sometimes I feel like I have to contribute with a different view of something that is often overlooked, that way maybe I can help others decide whether or not something is worth their time talking about the things they might dislike. <br />
<br />
This anime starts like your usual harmless Slice of Life RomCom, it starts from Uzaki&#039;s PoV as she greets her senpai Sakurai, cheering for a successful year in college. Time goes on and Uzaki notices that Sakurai spends his time alone, doing the things he likes in the space everyone respects. Out of curiosity, she then, decides to try to enter in Sakurai&#039;s life the next year by teasing him. On paper there&#039;s nothing wrong with this, it&#039;s like Teasing Master Takagi-san, but with college students and lewd stuff, however, the way this anime attempts to create a romcom is what went wrong. This anime manipulates the viewer into thinking that the way Uzaki treats Sakurai is cute, which, is not the case. Let&#039;s view it in Sakurai&#039;s shoes instead, Sakurai is minding his own business, enjoying life the way he wants, and then, suddenly, a girl comes in and starts bothering him and starts asking questions like &quot;why are you always alone? do you not have friends or anything&quot;, then, proceeds to mock him due to the way he spends his time and proceeds to be a bitch about it. Is it really that hard to understand when people wants AND enjoys to be by themselves? No, instead, This show crams Uzaki into Sakurai&#039;s life like if he was a freak of nature which personality should be fixed, forcing their relationship. Still not convinced? let&#039;s twist the story this way, let&#039;s say that Uzaki is a boy, and Sakurai is the girl. What would your reaction be if Uzaki were the boy teasing the girl instead? Gross and creepy right? Most people ALWAYS side with the girl and of course, people will sympathize more with Uzaki cuz she&#039;s a girl and it&#039;s cute when girls want to  ̶H̶a̶n̶g̶ ̶o̶u̶t̶ ̶w̶i̶t̶h̶  stalk a guy, no matter if the guy wants her or not. See the problem now? Uzaki is an annoying girl, that is clingy and pushy towards a boy that just want to mind his own business, is it too hard to respect that? I know, Sakurai&#039;s dumb ass could have just rejected her, he does show his annoyance, but he does nothing with it, which, is one of the things that bothered me the most and shouldn&#039;t be ignored. This anime also spams you with exhaustive &quot;jokes&quot; with Uzaki&#039;s awful smug face like: &quot;HAHAHAHA, OMG YOU&#039;RE SUCH A LONER, COME ON, YOU&#039;VE GOTTA LIVE SEMPAI&quot; &quot;OMG THAT&#039;S SO VERY LONER OF YOU, TO BE EXPECTED OF YOU SEMPAI&quot; Yadda yadda yadda.<br />
<br />
The way this anime depicts introverts as freaks of nature that should be forced to &quot;live&quot; the way everyone else &quot;lives&quot; their life just because introverts are simply not &quot;living it&quot; is extremely irritating. As an introvert myself, I love to spend time alone and that&#039;s not a bad thing, being overwhelmed with attention is not good, it&#039;s stressful. Also, enjoying time alone doesn&#039;t mean that introverts don&#039;t like to interact with others, in fact, I do like it when I hang out with my friends, but they understand when I don&#039;t want to hang out. People shouldn&#039;t be afraid of saying &quot;no&quot; to others, those who respect your decision are true friends, those who don&#039;t aren&#039;t worth your time. Now, I understand that the young Japanese population is very shy and need an incentive to open themselves to others, but there&#039;s a difference between giving a small push and straight up force your way into their lives. I highly doubt ANYONE would like it if someone they&#039;re not interested in, forces their way in and overwhelms their life by being extremely annoying, pushy and clingy, the last thing they&#039;ll achieve is to be a part of their lives. This anime forces their relationship a lot, everyone ships them as if they were meant to be with each other, Sakurai&#039;s &quot;friends&quot; constantly mock him for &quot;not taking the initiative&quot; and teases him into thinking he&#039;s an idiot for not going a step further with Uzaki. This honestly pisses me off to immeasurable amounts.<br />
<br />
Ecchi on this anime is dumb, repetitive, exhausting and irritating. Most of the jokes consists of shaming Sakurai in public with very suggestive scenes and dialogues. To create drama IN PUBLIC of things that can be misunderstood is uncalled for, Sakurai&#039;s dignity as a citizen could have been compromised just as Tsutsui from 3D Kanojo, but since everything is a joke on this anime it doesn&#039;t even matter and Sakurai has no other choice but to accept it. Misunderstandings on romance anime can be fun depending on the context and the characters, but this anime goes beyond stupidity with them, we&#039;re talking about freaking adults here, not horny highschool students, how does Uzaki&#039;s mom think that Sakurai wants to grope her breasts without considering the fact that she has a cat on her lap? Not just that, Uzaki&#039;s breasts are big enough to satisfy him, I could have taken it if Uzaki&#039;s breast were medium size, but no, they had to create a dumb misunderstanding that shouldn&#039;t have happened if these characters had common sense, but they don&#039;t. This anime is unfunny and most of the jokes are exhausted to the point of being unbearable, if someone is able to endure &quot;OMG HAHAHA YOU&#039;RE SUCH A LONER SEMPAI&quot; more than 10 times, good for them, but this is a bit too much, the more I hear her screechy voice with that awful smug face, the more unbearable it gets.<br />
<br />
Animation quality is not great, it serves it purpose just fine, but nothing memorable, there was this fireworks episode that could have been really endearing if Uzaki weren&#039;t such an annoying girl, but all the emotional weight is thrown to the gutter thanks to her. Talking about her, the sound department is deplorable, Uzaki&#039;s VA did a great job at being exceedingly annoying, most of the times the characters are screaming and that is not nice to anyone&#039;s ears, not a single music was memorable, the OP is annoying and the ED... is just there I guess.<br />
<br />
Man, I&#039;m tired...<br />
<br />
I&#039;m tired of how rom/coms are portrayed nowadays.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m tired of screechy, clingy, annoying anime girls.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m tired of stalker girls seen as cute in anime media.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m tired of forced anime relationships with 0 chemistry.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m tired of stupid misunderstandings.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m tired of illogical ecchi scenes<br />
<br />
I&#039;m tired of anime portrayal of &quot;friends&quot;<br />
<br />
When will be the day where we see a new Rom/Com that isn&#039;t just a stupid waifu wars or waifu pandering garbage with no substance at all?

    Uzaki-Chan is fucking cute! <br />
<br />
Stop denying the truth, folks. Accept her as your (only) waifu.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uzaki-chan wants to hang out&quot; is exactly what the title suggests - just a girl who likes to have fun. It is neither deep nor unique. It is wholesome. That my guys is more than enough. I am someone who doesn&#039;t demand much from anime because by doing so I could reach a point of disappointment beyond any help, but I was utterly pleased with this and couldn&#039;t be happier.<br />
<br />
Uzaki-chan talks about Uzaki and her senpai Shinichi spending their time together. She is this little girl with dekai tits and her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357395">
        senpai is an associated guy. The two will love each other but never before senpai gets bullied. Although, it&#039;s sweet bullying. Something that doesn&#039;t hurt but makes you feel better. For Senpai, this is a fine task to pay to get Uzaki. He loves her but can&#039;t confess to her. He&#039;s embarrassed to even though for most of the time he stays composed. He&#039;s what I personally would call &quot;gentleman at its finest&quot;.<br />
<br />
Senpai loves Uzaki&#039;s dekai tits and can&#039;t live without them. They motivate him and give him a happy life he so deserves. She is sometimes indecent and this a good thing for senpai. Think about this, who would want to live for the entire life with a non-perverted girl? I personally wouldn&#039;t and fortunately, neither does senpai. He knows to have chosen the best girl ever - he knows that if he leaves her now someone else will take her and that someone else will be the happy guy instead. That mustn&#039;t happen.<br />
<br />
Uzaki and Shinichi enjoy even the little moments that fate has prepared for them. They waste nothing and try to be happy. Does everything need a reason? No, it does not. It happens because it happens and it works because it works. Who are we to intervene in their relationship? Who are we to speak ill of them? We are nobody and we must strive to be like them - If you are in a relationship, be like them, behave like them, learn the hardships of life like them, and you too will be as happy as they are. Perhaps, this is the only way to go about.<br />
<br />
May we one day all get a girl like Uzaki.

Uzaki-chan can be summed up in a couple of sentences. Plot service and woman has fat titties. This anime’s plot is surrounded by the one and only Uzaki-chan’s personality and the various shenanigans that occur. Uzaki built like a fucking bean. The main character is non-existent as the show centers itself around the girl. The comedy follows the &quot;if it&#039;s random it&#039;s funny&quot; with ecchi seasoned over it but is poorly executed when being adapted into a show. The fans and the people that actually enjoy this shit are braindead. I don&#039;t understand anyone that can sit through this, but masochistic, cock-for-brained fucknuts. This show

    Uzaki Chan isn’t a complicated series but for its genre it’s really good in all departments and as a manga reader it only gets better on from here content wise. Now I’m being a little partial since this is one of my favorite series but otherwise I’ll be fair with a review if the anime adaptation sucks, in this case it doesn’t suck because besides few background characters from afar are sometimes CGI from a far shot( like most anime’s) the animation is smooth and simple and definitely makes Uzaki Chan’s expressions shine more. Though admittedly the studio behind the series sometimes makes Uzaki’s eyes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350665">
        to big compared to the manga and for some reason so many people are annoyed with that even though it’s not that bad. I’m not going to get into the Uzaki drama because  it’s literally over nothing and it’s all unnecessary and totally undeserved especially since this series isn’t some trash anime of the season kind of stuff and it’s actually enjoyable with many likable things about it...so anyway the review. <br />
<br />
Story: (7) Now these days with slice of life comedy series it’s extremely hard to think of something creative since it’s slice of life after all but that’s not really important with these kind of series, what’s important is characters and comedy if both of those things suck then it’s not a good slice of life series and this kind of slice of life story fits into the same role as Takagi and Nagatoro san (series about teasing) and while those series are very good it mostly involves the main heroine teasing their friend or senpai until they develop an adorable relationship between each other and while Uzaki fits into that category it’s more mutual teasing between Uzaki and Sakurai and being in college theirs more mature things involved with their teasing and some sexual bits. <br />
But surprisingly despite Uzakis big badonkers there is rarely any ecchi scenes and it focuses more on the character interaction which is one of this series best things going for it. Which is why I think this series can separate itself from any average slice of life series because of how it portrays it compared to other series. <br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: (9) Now like I said before the key to a good slice of life comedy is fun characters and obviously good comedy. Now comedy is subjective to each person so I’ll say that the comedy itself is a mixture of fun back and forth of roasts to sometimes sexual humor to hilariously clever misunderstandings and hilarious rants of relatable and stupid things. But the main seller of this series is the characters and is why this series is popular in the first place. <br />
Now before I get to why the characters are great I would like to give a hand to the author and artist Take and how he makes both main characters attractive physically in their own ways like I think they have great personalities too and truly that’s what matters but god damn I can’t lie and so how attractive Uzaki is and the many moments of Sakurai showing off his muscles and making me drool a little bit (I’m joking about the drool but he’s hot don’t judge) <br />
Anyway simply put Uzaki is both adorably annoying to very heart warming (especially shown in episode 3) that make Uzaki not just your stereotypical pair of tits type of character and we see her growth between her and Sakurai show how she is more then boobs like most people on Twitter think and how all she truly wants is to make Sakurai happy and Sakurai himself is enjoyably funny and we see that he isn’t a self insert MC and how <br />
he’s got a personality past the one trick pony of getting nervous or angry at Uzaki I mean he does and it’s understandable why he does get mad at her sometimes especially the chicken scene in episode 1 (I felt that on a personal level) but he sees Uzaki tries and especially in episode 3 where we see him being grateful towards Uzaki helping him when he got sick.<br />
Separately they are good but together they make one of the best duos in slice of comedy anime that I’ve seen recently because even when they are just helping  each other with homework they just click it never feels like to random strangers put together out of nowhere for lol’s it feels like they are soulmates in terms of friendship and hopefully romance soon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art/Animation: (7.5) I can’t give this a 7 exactly because it has some great moments but I just can’t give it an 8 because the animation isn’t amazing and I  kind of don’t like how Uzakis eyes are a bit bigger then in the manga but it’s not the biggest deal to me. For a studio that only has done one other anime they are doing a pretty good job because nothing looks bad and even at some moments I’m impressed with the animation and they seem to focus on small details and making sure that nothing looks still and it’s appreciated. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: (7) This consists of background music and OP and Ed’s, for the background music they add a good amount of sound effects but not in a way that makes it feel overboard but sometimes it does remind me of a Saturday morning cartoon with some sound effects and I’m not saying that’s a bad thing it gives off some charm and personally the Ed isn’t anything special but I do enjoy the op a lot it was one of those op’s that the more I listened to it the more it got stuck in my head because it’s got a good beat to it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: (10) This doesn’t really affect my score but I truly do love this series and it’s characters and they always make me smile and trust me the series gets better as each chapter goes by and I can’t wait to see people’s reaction to some scenes because this series is a gem in the amount of series that are airing in summer 2020 so I hope people actually watch the series before they say that this series is nothing but tits <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: (8.5, I don’t know whether to choose a 8 or 9 for it yet so I’ll stick with one of those and we’ll see) Now the manga is a 10/10 great slice of life series but I have small tidbit issues with the anime but none of them make a big deal or anything at all it’s just that I can’t say it’s a 10/10 unless I find it not flawed at all  (even though in some cases I give 10/10 to series that I know have at least small problems but I still enjoy them anyway).<br />
<br />
Anyway hope y’all enjoy this series and if you know that you’ll won’t enjoy the series due to personal taste or what not then don’t ruin the score, if you like these genres and still don’t enjoy it then those criticisms are okay because I know that those scores are at least honest and fair unlike ANN reviews of this series

    Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! is a very varied comedy anime with touches of romance in some scenes. With the above I want to clarify that this anime is not about Uzaki&#039;s breasts, so you should not fear ending up seeing something regrettable or sexualized.<br />
<br />
Story / Plot: 7/10<br />
<br />
Shinichi Sakurai is a university student, who spends all his days alone enjoying the peace and quiet... or so it should be, until Hana Uzaki, her cute, but annoying kōhai, appeared, who refuses to leave him alone and wants enjoy time with him by constantly having fun and bothering him, going out to all kinds of places and living situations

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357397">
        of all kinds with him.<br />
<br />
Characters / Personalities: 8/10<br />
<br />
Shinichi Sakurai who is 20 years old, is the main protagonist, he is a third-grade student at the university, a part-time worker in a cafe and a lover of silence and tranquility. He is an introvert, diligent and relentless, as well as rude, but only with Hana Uzaki, who continually teases him. As for his physique, he is quite tall, measuring 180 cm, he has &quot;poor&quot; eyes and a bad face that Uzaki makes fun of, he also has a toned body, since he enjoys playing sports and exercising, it is worth mentioning that he played baseball for one year and in high school I was part of the swimming club.<br />
<br />
Hana Uzaki who is 19 years old, but then turns 20, is the main protagonist, a second grader at the same university as Shinichi Sakurai who also works part-time in the same cafe as Sakurai and is someone who just wants to have fun. She has an energetic, cheerful, confident and generally playful personality, that is to say, the opposite of Sakurai, who likes to tease and embarrass him, with him she generally behaves like a girl. Regarding her physique, she is relatively short, measuring 150 cm in height, she has silver hair, large blue eyes, a &quot;fang&quot; in the upper left part of her mouth (it is curiously the same color as her skin) and a bust pretty big. By the way, she is not good at sports that require intense exercise and endurance.<br />
<br />
Ami Asai who is 21 years old, is the daughter of Akihiko Asai and a fourth-grade college student. She is a very calm girl, who enjoys observing the interactions of others and has a fetish for the muscles of the boys. By the way, she wants to bring Sakurai and Hana together, but she doesn&#039;t like to intervene too much in their relationship and really enjoys seeing how they interact. Regarding her appearance, she has a height of 160 cm, dark purple hair, a hair clip in her left and right bangs, and red glasses that she wears at all times.<br />
<br />
Itsuhito Sakaki who is 21 years old, is a third-year college student and a handsome boy who is quite popular with girls. At first glance Sakaki seems like someone nice and calm, but this is just a facade, since in reality he is calculating and meddlesome, as seen by wanting to unite Sakurai and Uzaki just like Ami, but intervening more than her and generating situations for They interact, even if he must use a lot of money, which does not affect him because his parents are rich. His appearance as I mentioned, is that of a handsome boy, he has a height similar to Sakurai, blue eyes and blond hair.<br />
<br />
Akihiko Asai, is the head of the cafe where Sakurai, Hana and their daughter Asumi work, with whom she usually entertains herself by observing the other two interacting. Apart from the above, not much is known about him and he is only seen working in the cafe. Regarding his appearance, he is a middle-aged man (51 years old), with gray hair, a mustache of the same color and glasses that are also gray.<br />
<br />
Tsuki Uzaki, Uzaki&#039;s mother and an overprotective woman with her daughter. She is quite calm and gentle-looking, but despite this she has a strange relationship with Sakurai, due to various misunderstandings that make her think that he is going after her body, so she generally feels insecure or scared when Sakurai is around, likewise, his eyes scare her too. Her appearance, despite being 43 years old, is that of someone young and small, since like her daughter her height is short, her hair is silver, her bust is large and her eyes are blue, which, by the way, almost always kept closed.<br />
<br />
Something extra that I must mention and that is a plus point in the aspect of the characters, is that all the Seiyū of the program did an excellent job, thus giving very nice and wonderful voices to all the characters.<br />
<br />
Animation / Atmosphere: 9/10<br />
<br />
The studio in charge of bringing this anime to television is ENGI, which is probably not well known, since it has only produced two anime, Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! and Hataage! Kemono Michi, but even so, it is still good and these two anime have a medium-high quality, which sometimes becomes completely high.<br />
<br />
First there is the setting, which is excellent and quite realistic, in it you can see incredible detail in all objects no matter how far away they are. Additionally, the above is a great positive point, as it makes the program pleasant to watch and generates greater enjoyment.<br />
<br />
As for the design of the characters, this is somewhat simple if we compare it with the quality of the setting, but the design is really not bad and that is what an anime of this genre would be expected, I should also mention that sometimes there are very &quot;static&quot; scenes, where there is not much movement on the part of the characters and they are mostly dialogues.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
<br />
In this aspect, despite not having much variety in terms of sound, the existing one is quite good, it is also important to mention that without the need for background sound at all times, the comic scenes are not affected by this and continue being quite funny or at least lively.<br />
<br />
Now I will go on to talk about the opening theme (Nadame Sukashi Negotiation), which in a few words can be defined as fun, happy, exciting and catchy. To tell the truth, the rhythm and the voice of the singers is excellent, so much so that, I think that anyone who has heard the opening theme just once is already able to recognize it wherever they hear it. As for the background video, I must say that it is perfect and combines completely with the anime, in the same way throughout it they show us all the characters, but mainly Sakurai and Uzaki in many mini-situations that in themselves are quite funny.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, there is the ending theme (Kokoro Knock) which, unlike the opening theme, maintains a calmer rhythm, but which as it progresses becomes animated and, in a few words, I would define it as calm, peaceful and encouraging. To tell the truth, like the opening theme, this one manages to convey a feeling with ease, since normally the anime maintains an atmosphere of joy and fun, but at the end, the shock of said joy with the strange feeling of &quot;loneliness &quot;Or&quot; peace &quot;that generates and transmits the ending theme, it may stir you up a bit inside, but in the end you will end up, at least, with a tear in your eye wishing this story would never end or with a big, full smile of hope.<br />
<br />
Enjoy: 10/10<br />
<br />
In short, this anime can be enjoyed by almost anyone, since apart from the excellent sense of humor, the anime maintains an atmosphere and sound that are a perfect accompaniment and that is summarized in that you will spend a pleasant, contrary to what others say regarding this one. I should also mention that in terms of the characters, these are somewhat different from the usual ones, so most of them may find them pleasant and somewhat “new”.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here ends my review, thank you very much for reading it and I hope it has been helpful, but more importantly that you enjoyed it. Any kind of comment do not hesitate to do it on my profile, I will respond as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Have a happy day.<br />

    I love this smug gremlin to death. <br />
<br />
As she was initially described, the phrase &quot;Annoying! Cute! But Annoying!&quot; hits the nail on the head. The illegally Dekai Sugoi&#039;s might be the initial point of interest, but I honestly believe letting yourself be swayed by design preferences into max horny or max disgust will make you miss out on one of the best characters in a good while.<br />
<br />
While it might be just another ecchi rom-com SoL in its core, Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! brings one of the best character dynamics to table yet, blowing its competition, and their cardboard cutout counterparts right out of the water. And

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350713">
        though the cover girl definitely plays her role as such, the series just would not work without the other half. Uzaki-chan is a perfect example of a simple series that is greater than the sum of its parts. <br />
<br />
While Uzaki is a great character on her own, the series just wouldn&#039;t work without Sakurai. Unlike many other serieses with a clear main pair, the bickering isn&#039;t one sided bullying with meak retorts which hold no weight, but rather genuine back and forth banter. Uzaki is a force of nature and will do what she wants to, but Sakurai ain&#039;t no slouch either, and always responds accordingly. You never know what either of them is going to do, and their reactions are even more unpredictable. This is the first time the main pair genuinely feel like best friends, rather than strictly limited to being love interests. I can not stress how much that adds to the charm.<br />
<br />
The supporting cast is also full throttle on supporting the development between the main pair, rather than act as obstacles to it. There is no forced NTR-bait, or fake drama for the sake of furthering the relationships. The entire series is just dumb, lovable fun. I&#039;ve yet to find a character I didn&#039;t like, a joke that was too far for comfort, or a scenario that didn&#039;t bring a smile to my face. I find it hard to digest that out of all things anime, this was the one to rile people up.<br />
<br />
The voice actors are on point. None of the earlier wouldn&#039;t work without their delivery. Just Uzaki screaming &quot;Senpai&quot; won my heart over. And to be honest, the quality of the acting definitely saves a few scenarios where the shots pan on for just a bit too long. On the topic of voice actors, the OP absolutely slaps ass as well, and fits the series like a glove.<br />
<br />
I am tremendously biased. The series was practically made for people like me. If I didn&#039;t give the series a 10, who would? <br />
<br />
Endless praise aside, the Anime is Outstanding, but by no means perfect. As I mentioned earlier, some of the charm from reading the gags from the panels of a manga are lost in bringing the manga into motion. The author usually crams such massive amounts of text in when Uzaki makes fun of her senpai, that they can&#039;t read the whole line through and still keep the delivery of the joke fluid. <br />
<br />
The art quality also isn&#039;t quite on par with the source material, but it definitely isn&#039;t a low budget atrocity like what some anime unfortunately end up like. I don&#039;t really know how to feel about TAKE&#039;s KUSOCAT-mascot making sudden appearances every now and then, it wouldn&#039;t quite fit into the anime-only experience, but at the same time, it&#039;s also kinda wholesome. Really gives the anime a passion-project vibe. For better or worse.<br />
<br />
The manga was my absolute favorite, and I&#039;m glad to say that I like the anime just as much. It&#039;s all I asked for, and then some.

    I feel very conflicted about this series, more than just the comedic rom-com that all of its genres seemingly is mashed together to create a lookalike Takagi/Nagatoro-san, but with slice-of-life-ish ecchi that is boisteringly over the top baseless and full of cringe. With that said, this review is gonna be SUGOI DEKAI to the max, and I don&#039;t freaking care, because love it or hate it, Uzaki-chan TRULY wants to hang out to the extreme, and her &quot;Annoying! Cute! But Annoying!&quot; persona to the manga of the same name that mangaka Take depicts her of, call it NSFW, SJW or other fap tags you&#039;d think

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357391">
        of, and that is all fine by me.<br />
<br />
The girl-teases-boy SoL trolling formula is nothing new, especially if you&#039;re VERY inclined into well-known mangaka Souichirou Yamamoto&#039;s &quot;Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san&quot; (the masterpiece standard) or 774&#039;s &quot;Ijiranaide, Nagatoro-san&quot; (which is said to be the most extreme form of the formula, teasing through bullying). In the case of Take, instead of just the school setting of &quot;same class hopefuls of one day becoming a couple&quot; cliche, he takes it one step further in creating the Senpai-Kouhai (senior-junior) and adds the ecchi taste to it, making it seem like in full-on preparation for the &quot;dirty jokes abound&quot; as the comedic effect plays it with varying levels of confidence to pull constant stunts off in questioning.<br />
<br />
More importantly, for stories like these to not have a central plot, it depends heavily on the characters to deal with the brunt of the figures, and it&#039;s the main characters: the annoying and heartful Hana Uzaki and lone wolf Shinichi Sakurai, that has to hit off well from the get-go. First, let&#039;s talk about the Kouhai that&#039;s one of the most discussed about this Summer: 2nd year college student Hana Uzaki. A short, petit girl with big, STACKED boobs (that screams SUGOI DEKAI!), she is the immersive extroverted kind and would be akin to the typical, most annoying person you&#039;d met in your lifetime (and won&#039;t go away even with heavy convincing), and that&#039;s because she is made that way. If you&#039;d give her enough attention, she can be very heartwarming to the friendship touch, but still yet has a composure that doesn&#039;t fall WAY OFF to the romance spectrum to keep even the lamest of &quot;sexual harassment&quot; trolls and jokes incoming. She is &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;, but in the most flattering way possible that I can still find some enjoyment to be had, true to honest. But she can&#039;t be a one-trick pony, OH NO, without the help of the &quot;I want to be alone&quot; moniker that is 3rd year Senpai Shinichi Sakurai. He is the typical average character that most of us all have been once in our lives, only that he has big muscles to boot and a heart of gold...at least for cats anyway. From the beginning, his constant deflection against Uzaki uncoincidentally pursues her interest to delve into his life even deeper, not knowing of the consequences of having such an annoying brat chasing after his ass. Hey Sakurai, you&#039;re already a damn lucky pervert to have a girl chasing you down, so why can&#039;t you acknowledge it, huh? But the charm grows on you once Uzaki knows slowly of Sakurai&#039;s unchanging habits, and the decrease in safe-distancing against her and slowly accepting her whims into his life, be it rain or shine.<br />
<br />
If I have to be very honest, the Uzaki-Sakurai duo is one of the more understandable &quot;comedic&quot; duos once you&#039;d get to know them better, and how they compliment their own strengths and weaknesses towards each other, not in the mindset of a couple, but of soulmates not randomly strewn together like a &quot;red thread of fate&quot;, makes them more appealing for a unique charm of character growth and development that&#039;s complementary to the overall series. Sakurai transforms from a stereotypical person to one that&#039;s being influenced, and Uzaki in return, can reciprocate to his needs that might not put a smile on his face, but definitely a reassurance of the heart, an anthem of the heart if you oh-so-will infer. From simple things like college homework to just plainly hanging out together for meals or working together, it speaks volumes of the manga&#039;s narrative and ambitions (and also why it went popular in the first place).<br />
<br />
Of course, without some bootlicking of the Uzaki-Sakurai &quot;romantic&quot; duo, how can this show afford to be more enjoyable? Introducing the side characters: Ami Asai and her dad Akihiko (commonly referred to as The Master) at the cafe that Sakurai works in, and his best bud of a ladies&#039; man, Sakaki Itsuhito. Ami is on a Senpai level against both Uzaki and Sakurai, and her fetish for muscles only works as an imaginary &quot;touch&quot; of Sakurai, and of course, the Master himself, is a wise man of confidence. But deep down, the father-daughter duo are matchless when it comes to Sakurai and his job, and thereafter when Uzaki&#039;s interference of the lame man poses a bigger opportunity to work together with him, ensuring that both Ami and her dad get tons of &quot;stalker&quot; enjoyment watching them from afar, all for some whisk of romantic progression to munch on imaginatively. Sakaki on the other hand, enjoys his time being popular with the ladies, but the finest moment of his life is joining forces with Ami (though their disagreement in the beginning wenches each other&#039;s favour to the betterment of how they should view the comedic duo). And HELL NO, how could I forget about the mother figure of Tsuki Uzaki, certainly I&#039;d expect the &quot;like mother, like daughter&quot; cliche to throw up its punchline? Scary...<br />
<br />
OH, AND THAT KUSO CAT that is symbolic for manga readers, and now with the anime with it appearing at scenes of highly sexualized favours of romance *muack* (and anywhere where &quot;appropriate&quot;), plus the Uzaki house of cats which have SOOO many misunderstandings of &quot;petting&quot;. Leave the sexual tension to yourself, mate.<br />
<br />
This is the 2nd work of Kadokawa&#039;s new subsidiary studio ENGI (the first being the subpar adaptation of KonoSuba&#039;s novelist&#039;s work on Hataage! Kemono Michi), and comparing against the 2, whatever that is viewed of the former series can be applied here without a doubt. The same lack of soft art and &quot;less is more&quot; animation is a serious drab to look at, even with the use of CGI in the OP. But regardless, the job of the production team is to get one thing done right: getting on par with the manga visuals, and I can say that while it&#039;s not amazing, it gets the job done at least without looking bad (or should I say, it&#039;s so bad it&#039;s good).<br />
<br />
Again, nothing impressive in the sound department, but it sure is as hell as boring if there ain&#039;t some comedic BGM to follow up through the constant nitpicking and tension of the characters, to which I appreciate really having it there, even if it&#039;s to showcase the &quot;background audience laugh&quot; that was once a chore, to which it grows as time passes. The OP between Kano and Uzaki-chan&#039;s VA is a love-hate relationship that I&#039;d thought was thought-provoking, but also, the passing of time shows its fruits of labour, and gives off a good vibe that I can&#039;t stop ringing my ears to the song&#039;s influence. Don&#039;t know much about YuNi&#039;s lineup of songs, but the ED is comforting enough to end the episodes on a kind note.<br />
<br />
Overall, this is a show that will definitely turn off the heads of the normal otaku to even regular anime-onlys for doing a disservice on its plot which is just full-on horny and sexualized favours looking for the main couple to get laid on. But give it a second chance to see from another view, and you might just have been converted from an elitist hater to a best lover. Once again, a disclaimer, it&#039;s not for everyone, but only to the faithful of sarcastic narcissists who can find an inch or 2 of this gem to like about and proclaim its genuine greatness.

    Uzaki-chan is a small girl with a sugoi dekai…heart. And breasts. Abnormally large breasts. I mean seriously, is this girl ok? Her proportions give cause for concern. The main dude should really get her a doctor or something!<br />
<br />
The anime itself is pretty simplistic. It’s basically akin to Nagatoro-san and Takagi-san in that it features a cute girl pestering a flustered guy with the end goal being that they’ll probably get together by the conclusion of the series.  Except so far, I don’t believe that Uzaki-chan has reached the level of the two aforementioned series. The comedy and interactions between the protagonists has had its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350668">
        moments, but generally I find myself getting bored with some of the scenes and dialog. And since this is the type of anime that won’t really have any drastic changes throughout the rest of its runtime, you can probably expect a similar execution for each remaining episode. I just hope that future scenarios will get me more invested.<br />
<br />
While Uzaki as a character is pretty cute and energetic, I found myself liking the cafe owner the most. This dude and his daughter have honestly been the best part of the show for me, and I’ve been amused at how they just observe the main characters and provide commentary.<br />
<br />
Audiovisuals have been fine so far. Voice acting is appropriate and the soundtrack is fitting. I’ve liked a lot of the backgrounds like the university and tech store, and the character designs look standard. Except Uzaki. There’s just something quite bizarre about her aesthetic. Though I guess I should say somethings, since there are actually two bulging problems with her look. But hey, I’m sure she appeals to a lot of people, so it’s fine I guess? Yeah, ok. <br />
<br />
Uzaki-chan is a cute, lighthearted anime that should be watched if you just want to see some fun character interactions. Now there might be some depth to the show later on since it’s been teased in brief flashbacks that Uzaki drastically changed as a person thanks to her interactions with senpai back in high school, but we’ll just have to wait and see if that goes anywhere. Until then, Uzaki-chan will most likely continue to be a pretty basic anime.<br />

    I’d like to consider myself an observer rather than an active participant in the pernicious social media discourse that’ll orbit a show like this on principle. People fascinate me, truly, because in the midst of what has been the most challenging and bizarre year in our contemporary human history, we can still find the mental vacancy to compartmentalize all of that bullshit and draw our ire towards the REAL issues...the Tid. Or more specifically, the 2D Tid, you know, like the kind you can’t feel? But I guess to properly enjoy a show like “Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai!”, you need A LOT of mental vacancy. I’m

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357398">
        not going to pay much heed to any of the facile rhetoric lobbed towards this anime, because quite frankly, I don’t give a shit one way or the other. Unless a show is deliberately trying to ram a narrative down my esophagus, it takes a lot for me to roll up my sleeves and polish my ivory sword, even more so if that show is a fucking cartoon. <br />
<br />
Uzaki-chan is one of those rare instances where I was already fairly well-acquainted with the source material and author before having watched its adaptation. While half of the Uzaki stanbase at large was drying on their parents’ mattresses, I was already hip to this shit (another notch on my anime hipster belt). I have to hand it to Take (the mangaka) though, the man’s a genius. Whether it’s rabid affection or vehement disgust, Uzaki’s viral marketing potential speaks for itself. This obstreperous oblong drove stakes through my eardrums and burned herself into my corneas well before her anime was announced. That’s due in part to Take’s distinct...idiosyncrasies as an artist. <br />
<br />
Take made a name for himself as a decently popular doujin artist before making the eventual transition to serialization. I follow quite a number of independent artists myself because more often than not, independent artists don’t have to worry about time crunches and have far more freedom to work at a pace that will produce the absolute best result. That said, I can’t say Take’s particularities really measure up to the best of them. He’s not exactly punching under his weight, he has his niche, clearly, and I can respect that. I mean, who else can we turn to when we’re craving malformed prenatal pagan ritual eldritch moeblobs like Uzaki? I mean look at this snaggle-toothed, bobble-headed, big-eyed, monstrosity of a character design. She looks like a jack-o-lantern carved by Ray Charles with that gaping half-moon watermelon mouth and skin-sheath covering her fang. What does she even need that thing for? Will she get tetanus if that thing scrapes against her bottom lip? <br />
<br />
As a virile young 20-something like myself, I have to admit, breasts are indeed tantalizing. There’s nothing wrong with watching this show purely for the proverbial “eye-candy” if ecchi anime do it for you, but what good is enjoying a piece of eye-candy if you’re just sucking on it with the wrapper still on? The boobs are a gimmick, clearly, but they don’t really do all that much with them. They’re just kind of there to throw darts at as an easy punchline when it behooves the script to do so. My point being, if you’re going to draw a character like this in a transparent attempt to exploit her design, why pair down the fanservice? We’re living in an era where “Ishuzoku Reviewers” masterfully broke every single rule that an ecchi should and could. When I watch a show like Uzaki-chan proudly whore their mascot out on the corner with 7 layers of thick sweaters and winter boots on the half-hearted promise of the occasional flaccid skirt lift, I can’t help but feel cheated. Uzaki-chan is about as sexy as a stubbed toe (and twice as bulbous).  <br />
<br />
You could make the argument that Uzaki as well as the whole of the Uzaki clan at large are “just drawn that way”, but that’s woeful ignorance. This is a series spearheaded by someone who cut their teeth drawing “paizuri” comics for a living. Uzaki’s “Sugoi Dekai” t-shirt is this generation’s “Mega Milk” except not nearly as fun, if you know what I mean by that. This anime lacks the sex-appeal to get away with designing a character like this for any good reason other than to just bounce your eyes from any given corner of the screen like a game of ping-pong. <br />
<br />
It’s nigh impossible to have a discussion about this anime that doesn’t ultimately circle back to this little shit’s design. It’s fundamentally baked into the spine that supports the bosom of this show’s trademark. But why dwell on this for as long as I have? Because there’d be fuck-all to talk about otherwise.  <br />
<br />
Uzaki is just one half of a brilliant Manzai duo, and believe it or not, her partner in crime, one Shinichi Sakurai, almost annoys me as much as his...heh...“titular” co-lead. Shinichi is such a transparent case of pandering wish-fulfillment that it’s impossible to buy him as the role he wishes to inhabit. Through no fault of his own (because of his “mean face”), he’s a loner but he just so happens to be conventionally attractive in every conceivable way. He’s tall, muscular, young, and has sharp eyes which puts him in the top 5% of all knuckle-draggers roaming the land and planting their seeds. He’s such a failure of a loner that his only real problem in life is that he’s drowning in tits at any given hour of the day, oh woe is him. The mean-eyed gag is used so sparingly that it makes it even harder to believe that this man has much difficulty with ANYTHING because of his face. <br />
<br />
Uzaki-chan’s endgame as a story (besides the boilerplate slice of life hijinks) is to have Uzaki facilitate Shinichi’s social competency. There is absolutely nothing wrong with living a solitary lifestyle if that’s your preference, but Uzaki-chan has absolutely no idea how to broach this topic in a clever or didactic way. It’s perfectly content with taking a flippantly dismissive stance against people who choose to do so. I don’t know about you, but if I were a character like Shinichi being pestered by some manic pixie dream goblin, that would make me even MORE of a recluse. Uzaki-chan reads to me as an unrefined amateurish work conceived by someone who knows how to sell their manga but with only a tenuous grasp of what to actually do with it. <br />
<br />
Anything that gives this show a sense of identity is effectively dismantled by and cherry-picked from other properties that rock it better. Why watch this show for the T&amp;A if there are any number of functionally better cartoons to get your rocks off to? Why watch this show for the character dynamic when you can watch or read Takagi-san or Nagatoro-san that do far more interesting things than just “BAHAHAHAHAHAH SENPAI!!!” ? Why watch this show for the high-pitched squealing and sleep-paralysis gremlins when Keeping Up With the Kardashians is 19 seasons deep, dog? <br />
<br />
Suffice to say, anime is perhaps the most renewable resource on the planet. There’s a school of thought not just among anime fans but with people who regularly consume media whose core tenet is to defend mediocrity because originality is overrated and doesn’t always pay off so we may as well just accept recycled tried and true formulas as long as they are competently executed. “Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai!” isn’t just mediocre, it’s AGGRESSIVELY mediocre. This show isn’t bad enough to knock a few back with a group of friends and enjoy with tempered irony. But it’s not good enough to recommend in any capacity. We all know why people bother with giving this show the time of day, it’s in the title of the damn thing, but hey, I’m not one to point at and laugh at one’s proclivities (as vexing as this one in particular may be). But come on guys, you can do SO much better. <br />
<br />
Your time on this earth is finite my friends, don’t waste it on shit like this just to prove how “red-pilled” you are, nobody’s impressed. I do it so you don’t have to.

    [TLDR at the bottom]<br />
<br />
Look at the poster for this anime. You see that thing? That sad excuse of a character design? Those giant fucking eyes with that stupid fucking hair with that obviously pandering skin fang? Those stupidly massive tits that take up half of her body mass? <br />
<br />
Just one look at this anime version of a skin gremlin is enough to tell you about her entire personality. Just as she looks like a monster, she acts like a monster. Constantly annoying people that are just minding their own business. Constantly trying to grab someone&#039;s attention. Constantly laughing in your face at your expense. Constantly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357431">
        trying to make this about herself without giving any care to anyone around her. She isn&#039;t just a character. She is the embodiment of all things evil in the world.<br />
<br />
Well, maybe it&#039;s not that bad. After all, she seems to only acknowledge one person in this entire anime. Except that he sucks too. If I were to direct your attention to the poster, you would see that this is a guy you can find in any other anime. Completely boring and unremarkable character design. Except this time he yells. And gets angry. Do you like angry people? I don&#039;t. But this guy&#039;s anger stems from Uzaki herself. Which is completely and utterly understandable. If only he cut ties with her for the rest of his life. But no. This motherfucker has the gall to fall in love with that thing (even if he doesn&#039;t know it in typical rom-com fashion). <br />
<br />
Do you see the psychological manipulation this girl is doing? After constantly harassing this man who is just trying to mind his own business she ropes him into romantically tense moments. There is no chemistry here. They don&#039;t seem genuinely happy being with each other. One harasses another. The other can only get angry but for some reason lets this shit happen over and over again.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m being overly dramatic here. It&#039;s not something to get that angry about. It&#039;s worse. It&#039;s boring. It&#039;s the worst combination of being both anger-inducing and being the same sleep-inducing rom-com shit every episode. This anime does nothing new for the genre.  Misunderstandings that get dragged on and on for the entire episode. Side characters whose entire personality is wanting the main two to get together for fun (which might work if I actually wanted these two to get together). Giant tits that keep accidentally being grabbed. Characters that comment on how big the fucking tits are. Did I mention how fucking big these tiddies are? Maybe it wouldn&#039;t be a problem if there was good fanservice here, but believe me I was flaccid watching this entire season. <br />
<br />
The art here is pretty bad. For some reason there is very little contrast here. A lot of the scenes I see are dominated by gray and brown colors. And as far as the music department is concerned, I can&#039;t recall a single track. But the opening annoys the shit out of me. <br />
<br />
[TLDR] Actually. Watch the opening of this anime. Because that embodies this entire show. If for whatever reason you like the opening or Uzaki&#039;s character design, you&#039;d probably like this anime. But for someone who wanted to curb-stomp the main character since the beginning, this was the first anime I&#039;ve given a 1/10.

    &quot;Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!&quot; is one of the most offensive anime I have seen. And by that I don&#039;t mean offensive jokes, or gore, or something like that. What I mean is that the show has no respect for its audience. It knows the bare minimum required for its target audience to eat it up, so it does that, and nothing else. There was next to no effort put into this show.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s get the Twitter drama out of the way. I do not like Uzaki&#039;s design. Not because it&#039;s &quot;problematic&quot;, but because I just hate characters with massive boobs. But that&#039;s just personal preference.<br />
<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357748">
        first thing you might try to say to me  is &quot;It&#039;s a slice of life comedy! It doesn&#039;t have to have deep, complex characters or a riveting plot. It just has to be funny!&quot; And I don&#039;t disagree with you. However, the comedy in this show is so lazy, that I&#039;m allowed to look at and critique the other aspects of this show as well. Now what do I mean by lazy? I mean that the jokes present in Uzaki are a compilation of the most common and overused jokes in these types of slice of life romcom shows. They have the indirect kiss (person a takes bite or sip out of something then offers to person b, person b thinks about how it is indirect kiss and gets embarrassed), misunderstandings (person a talks about something, person b thinks they are talking about something sexual, hilarity ensues), and even the ecchi signatures such as girl spilling fluid over herself so you can see boobs, or guy falling onto girl, touching her boobs in the process. There is not a single joke in this show that I couldn&#039;t find in 20 other romcom slice of life anime. There is zero effort made to come up with unique jokes, instead it copies jokes done a thousand times.<br />
<br />
Now that I have explained why the comedy falls flat on its stupid face, allow me to discuss the other aspects of this abomination.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
It&#039;s a slice of life<br />
<br />
Characters: <br />
Our male MC, Sakurai, is about as close to a plank of wood that you can get. His most defining features are he has mean looking eyes (never seen that before, *cough* Toradora *cough*), he&#039;s a loner, he&#039;s athletic, and he likes cats. His entire character is an introduction statement you&#039;d give on the first day of school. Now let&#039;s talk about the star of the show: Uzaki. She has big tits, uh, and she likes to pick on Sakurai? That&#039;s all that she really has to her. The other characters aren&#039;t even worth mentioning because they are just as flat if not more flat than these 2 main characters. <br />
<br />
Art/Animation and Sound:<br />
The art is about as generic as you can get. When you ask a person that doesn&#039;t watch anime what they think &quot;anime&quot; looks like, the style that they are imagining is probably exactly what this show looks like. The lighting is horrible. Basically every character in every scene has no shadows and no definition to their face. The soundtrack is forgettable, so I won&#039;t talk about it. The sound effects used are so bland, and reused multiple times. They even used the generic &quot;record stop&quot; sound effect. No passion was put into anything regarding art, animation, or sound.<br />
<br />
*Spoiler for episode 11 ahead*<br />
Before I finish this review, I want to talk about one last thing that really infuriated me. The ending of episode 11 offended me to no end. The fact that the show thinks that it deserves the viewers emotional investment, and for them to actually feel sad is an insult to the viewer. The show did absolutely nothing to deserve the reaction that they desire from the audience, yet they have the gall to do it anyway.<br />
<br />
If you thought that &quot;Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!&quot; was funny, then good for you. But if you think this show is a well done piece of fiction, then you have been tricked and exploited.<br />
This is my first review, so I would love to hear some feedback on what I did well and what I can do better. I know that this might seem like more of a rant than a review, but I hope I was able to get my points across regardless. Thank you for reading :)<br />

    As an incoming college student, I actually would want to see some of my underclassmen go to the same school as mine when I become a second year. The sheer happiness of someone who you spent time with still goes with you in a different school is just amazing to think about. This is why I can really relate, or more accurately, be somewhat jealous of what&#039;s happening in this series. <br />
<br />
Four episodes have passed since this series has started, but all of my opinions since episode one still hold true, if not, becoming better each episode that passes by. The story is about Hana

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350646">
        Uzaki, a rather cheerful and pompous college student who is clingy to her upperclassman Shinichi Sakurai—the same upperclassman who she shared the same club with in high school. There, Uzaki does what she can so that Sakurai won&#039;t be a &quot;loner,&quot; which little the both of them know, will soon entangle them into many sidesplitting misunderstandings in the future.<br />
<br />
I am going to admit, the setting is very cliched. The premise is used in many other forms in many other stories which are too many to count. Even so, that does not mean I don&#039;t like it. While that kind of cliché is something that reflects on the lives of many people as well, the series has done well in portraying that, although I might admit that Sakurai got very lucky, regardless of his annoyance. I may want something new or something innovative, but when it comes to stories—or rather premises like these—I don&#039;t mind. In fact, I welcome these with all my heart to enjoy what it offers.<br />
<br />
The characters are quite colorful as well. Here, we have the stereotypical girl—Uzaki—who likes to tease the boy she acquaints with, or rather, likes. Then, we have the typical tsundere character—Sakurai— which by now I am not surprised that it went to a male character. The bottom line is, it&#039;s as cliched as it can get, but once again, it doesn&#039;t mean that I hate it. I am loving the characters and the way that they are written, and the way they do their roles is as amazing, too.<br />
<br />
One thing that confuses me, to be honest, is our female protagonist, Uzaki. Before watching this anime—even before this anime was aired, there have been some dislike against her, most notably is her character design. I did not get, nor I would want to attempt to for even a second to understand how people could not like her design that much, to the point that it became well-known through the internet, when for me, it&#039;s very adorable, cute, beautiful, and other synonyms that one can think about. Uzaki&#039;s design, especially that flesh fang is something I haven&#039;t seen in some time, and it feels refreshing to see when she appears onscreen. Each man to his own, I guess.<br />
<br />
As for the sound, I think the most notable part would be the OSTs and its cheerful and adventurous tone and melody. That particular scene in the first episode where Uzaki goes after Sakurai as very, very amazing. It has that certain rhythm that would make you pumped up, and in my case, made my body feel the chills, but that&#039;s because of how good the music is, reverberating through my spine. I go as far as listening to it when I think about it, making me remember how good it is—were those trumpets? I think those were trumpets. Either way, I would really want to listen to these tracks when they get released in CDs.<br />
<br />
The opening theme does not disappoint either. It&#039;s so good to the point that I could sing it whenever anyone would ask me to. When you listen to the very first line, the sharps and tritones that you could hear makes me very motivated. The ending song is also amazing: relaxing, meaningful, and easy to sing along with. I won&#039;t be surprised if I fall asleep with the song one of these days. The refrain part also hits me hard—that impact on how the notes just blends together in perfect harmony and the perfect voice execution really is superb. This is why I love Japanese anime music.<br />
<br />
The art is also well-done, seeing as I could notice how the characters are well-animated. Making me go through four episodes worth of Uzaki&#039;s cuteness and pulchritude is something comparable to… eating what you want when you want… something like that. Just seeing her many faces, sad, happy, in pain, laughing, annoyed, pensive, poker, angry—I can&#039;t get enough of how adorable she really is. The sceneries and backgrounds do not stray far from the typical anime perspective and art style, and I also appreciate the fact that such effort in animation is not something held back on a slice of life anime like this. Nevertheless, that also applies to character designs like how I repeatedly said it earlier: Uzaki&#039;s design is cute, and I like that very much, same with the other characters.<br />
<br />
In just four episodes, I am feeling very elated and excited as to how things could go as more episodes get released. Seeing how wacky and funny Uzaki is when socializing with Sakurai and the others just makes me want to see more, and that by itself why I consider myself unfortunate. Waiting for a week for an episode is too long. Even so, I will strive to wait—all for the glory… ahem… all to see much more hilarious hijinks and shenanigans my beloved characters will ensue. I even enjoyed this anime so much that I keep watching the episodes I have again and again and again, and will never get old—I am even listening to the opening and ending themes on repeat while writing this review.<br />
<br />
Overall, this series is not good. Yes, you heard me, it&#039;s not good—basing on the episodes so far, and what I am expecting in the next episodes, it&#039;s one of the best not only in this season, but maybe overall if you ask me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kokoro no tobira wo tataiteru, hitotsu, futatsu, narihibu NOKKU, dare ni mo kikoenai mama, kimochi ha nemuru…&quot;<br />
<br />
The ending song that might translate to what the anime will become in the future brings me with excitement as well as a little bit of anxiety. Will this innocent slice of life anime go towards the path of romance, or will it become as that? No matter what, I look forward to more episodes. Boku ha ganbarussu!<br />

    Uzaki-chan was a pleasant surprise of this season. <br />
In a way, almost every anime that came out on Summer 2020 ought to be a pleasant surprise, since, you know. BUT uzaki-chan really amazed me <br />
<br />
It&#039;s a story about two college students who, by the sake of destiny, are together to ~hang out~. And they are as sweet as a college student can be.<br />
<br />
Uzaki-chan is a dream friend, she is cute, energetic, caring and has a ~Sugoi Dekai~ pack. And her senpai is everything she isn&#039;t, and they make THIS messy relationship to have so much chemistry together, it&#039;s really a relief. <br />
<br />
Sure it has a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350650">
        lot of ecchi...esque themes going on in every episode, but the characters compensate that with a REALLY good comedy. <br />
<br />
Overall it&#039;s an 7/10, you should definitely check this out.

    I gladly present you Hitomi Tanaka-chan Wants to Hang Out! review.<br />
<br />
Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! focuses on Hana Uzaki, who meets her high school friend and senpai, Shinichi Sakurai. Having observed his actions for some time, Uzaki comes to the conclusion that her beloved senpai has started to act like a grumpy old man and that he hardly has any friends because of that. Hana, without giving it a thought, immediately decides to fix this unjust cruelty and to hang out with a lonely senpai of hers.<br />
<br />
I am going to be honest here, this is going to be the most difficult review out of all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357387">
        the shows from the summer. First things first, Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! is a romantic comedy, at least, it tries to be such, but later about that. The storyline is not that bad and it even has enough material to be good. However, the moment the anime starts, you quickly forget about any hopes that this romantic comedy might actually be fun to watch. Do not get me wrong, as I have mentioned already, story wise, it is not that bad. The problem arises later on, when you meet the anime’s characters. <br />
<br />
Character wise, this is where Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! becomes Hitomi Tanaka-chan Wants to Hang Out! Take for example one simple fact that romantic comedies are supposed to have some chemistry between the characters, which makes them interesting and heartwarming to follow. Here, however, the characters receive such a terrible development that I do not even know what joke, or pun I should use to demonstrate you how bad they actually are. There is nothing unique about them and that is the main problem; the series does not even try to be ‘somehow’ unique. Hana Uzaki has quite a chest and it is absolutely fine, that is not the problem at all. The problem, however, is the fact that when watching the anime, it, just like an annoying spam message that you cannot close no matter what you do, tries to show you that Hana has big boobies and the show tries to show it so hard that it is simply laughable. <br />
<br />
What should I write about a show that does not have anything unique about it at all? I do not know. If I want to see big animated boobs, I would rather watch some hentai, which I highly recommend you to do, as well. I do not know, if it is bad writing, or if the voice actors are to blame for the fact that Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! is just beyond boring. I do not know how I should react to all these ‘hey, that vibrating exercise equipment makes Uzaki’s boobs jiggle like crazy’ moments. This, indeed, used to be an amazing joke that was funny, when I found out that girls’ breasts develop during puberty. <br />
<br />
On this very positive note, if you are looking for some jiggling boobies, Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! is exactly what you are looking for. Tastes differ, some people like something that others hate. However, if you are looking for a romantic comedy that tries to be unique, for a romantic comedy that has good chemistry between a man and a woman, I would recommend you to refrain from watching this anime.

    An insanely derivative anime. Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai is dull even for the SoL genre.<br />
  <br />
<br />
The artistic style is neither awful or revolutionary, it&#039;s just fine. This anime sports an artistic style akin to any other generic SoL anime made after 2010.<br />
<br />
The characters are boring. The only redeeming or memorable character is Uzaki herself, but that isn&#039;t saying much. The protag comes off as a one dimensional self-insert character. <br />
<br />
The story itself is non-existent, it&#039;s a trope-filled SoL/RomCom like any other. Expect cliches like beach or shopping episodes.<br />
<br />
And by far it&#039;s worst trait: it fails as a comedy. The &quot;jokes&quot; often end up being unintentionally

          <span style="display: none;" id="review352856">
        embarrassing. I had to drop the show after Ep6, when the protag wearing a blinder accidentally gropes Uzaki and mistakes her breasts for a watermelon, a &quot;joke&quot; that was more-or-less already done in the first episode. It makes me question whether or not the studio has already run out of ideas for the show.<br />
<br />
Anime like Uzaki-chan is shallow and devoid of any cultural significance, like many anime of it&#039;s kind, it exists only to sell overpriced merchandise. This show will be forgotten entirely in a few years time.

    A pretty simple concept, but one that I really like.<br />
Similar to anime like Takagi-san or to manga like Gal Gohan.<br />
<br />
The main core of this anime is Uzaki-chan and I like her a lot, she has a really nice character. She teases the main character just right and is really cute on top of that.<br />
I also like that she is not just teasing him because, but because she cares about him and doesn&#039;t want him to be a loner all the time.<br />
There are also a lot of funny scenes and Uzaki-chan is not the stereotypical tsundere, but an unique character.<br />
<br />
The main character is also fine, not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350656">
        the overly shy type, but more confident and not awkward like a lot main characters in this type of anime/manga.<br />
<br />
If you don&#039;t have too high expectations, like expecting a great story or something like this, you will enjoy the show, if you like the concept itself and Uzaki-chan<br />
<br />
Overall 8/10 so far. <br />

    When you first see this anime you might think that it’s just the same old anime where the male mc is awkward and a nerd and female mc is popular and a tsundere and they repeat the same jokes and in the end they fall in love with each other, but sorry to disappoint you that’s not the case. Uzaki chan wants to hangout is a masterpiece of slice of life and comedy genre! Episode after episode I craved to have a glimpse of this anime, I Laughed a lot and if this anime doesn’t get a second season... *sad music*  MY HEART. WOULD

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357419">
        BREAKK. INTO LITTLE PIECES. *sad music* now now let me review the individual components of this show.<br />
<br />
Story-10/10<br />
In the synopsis the story didn’t seem interesting at all, but when I witnessed this anime eye to eye, it was love in first sight. The jokes, the misunderstandings, felt so good, it was really outstanding, had quite a nice time while watching it.<br />
<br />
Art-7/10<br />
Well there’s nothing bad with art, but I wouldn’t say it was a masterpiece. It seemed to be well suited with this anime. Btw I loved the character design.<br />
<br />
Sound-9/10<br />
The sound and the ost was pretty good. The voice actors sure have put there whole heart in it. Also the op was amazing.<br />
<br />
Character-10/10<br />
The characters were amazing! The male protagonist seems to be a bookworm and not popular among others, but he’s a god damn athlete! But I couldn’t promise you on the popular part ;) the female protagonist is also so goddamn great! She’s annoying sometimes but you can’t seem to ignore her other qualities(like annoying male mc lol). The other characters are also unique and have a good chemistry which improves the show.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-10/10<br />
Enjoyed it a lot, never seemed to be bored of it. Would recommend it to get into slice of life and comedy anime, its a must watch!<br />
<br />
In the end I would just like to say that Uzaki chan wants to hangout is a great anime! Of course everybody have their different opinion and that’s okay with me. But you should definitely check this out!

    I don&#039;t know why people give such a harsh review. Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! is a very simple straightforward anime - a girl who&#039;s trying to help her sempai have a more interesting life. Sure, the plot is cliche, but once you watch many styled anime like this, the story frame is usually going to be the same, it&#039;s just of a matter of how they execute it. <br />
<br />
I like the art of the character, I&#039;m not expecting a &#039;blow me away&#039; animation like Makoto Shinkai&#039;s animations. The theme song kinda gives me the Haganai vibes, not sure if it is the same artist but it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review351309">
        sure does feel like it. <br />
<br />
Personally I am enjoying this ongoing anime. Simple, fun, straightforward. Don&#039;t go to every anime expecting to scrutinise everything. This anime engages me even with it cliche story.

    SUGOI DEKAI<br />
<br />
Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! does exactly what is says on the tin and all the comedic hijinks it goes along with it.<br />
<br />
Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! or Uzaki wants to Hang Out is about Sakurai Shinichi voiced by Kenji Akabane who just wants to have the loner life in university but Uzaki Hana voiced by Naomi Oozora however thinks otherwise and gets Sakurai to be less of a loner and stoic type and more outgoing and thus starts a brilliant yet funny relationship between the two with many a smug smiles, innuendos and teasing to go around.<br />
<br />
The basic premise is nothing but that, Uzaki getting Sakurai to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357481">
        go out and &quot;have fun&quot; but it&#039;s how Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! executes this and goes ALL THE WAY with it is what makes this anime VERY good.<br />
<br />
Before LA begins LA KNOWS this anime has some unwarranted controversy about it and to that once again it&#039;s just people who barely looked at the anime itself and judges as so, no Uzaki is not 14 or something, the anime itself makes it clear she&#039;s in university thus 18 or so and yes the anime itself does bring in some fanservice jokes about Uzaki&#039;s &quot;SUGOI DEKAI&quot;, but that&#039;s more or less them screeching for the sake of screeching, this comedy anime in itself revolves around Uzaki and Uzaki makes Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! what it is and &quot;changing&quot; it just ruins the anime in it&#039;s entirety.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can hate whatever you want, but don&#039;t diss what someone else likes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ok with THAT out of the way, Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai!&#039;s primary focus is towards it&#039;s comedy and bringing Sakurai into funny situations and his quips towards Uzaki that&#039;s one of the best selling points of this anime is IT&#039;S GOLD, to the point it&#039;s pretty much lampshaded and used as a running gag with the bystanders of Ami Asai voiced by Ayana Taketatsu and her father along with Itsuhito Sakaki voiced by Tomoya Takagi &quot;eating rice&quot; off those situations.<br />
<br />
Now Ami and her father more or less have this bystander approach into nudging Uzaki and Sakurai into a relationship whilst Sakaki takes a more forceful approach, something Ami doesn&#039;t like, same goals, differing methods.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless the main focus of the anime is Uzaki wanting hang out with Sakurai with MANY comedic hijinks ensuing.<br />
<br />
Now the comedy itself does seem refreshing what with the setting of Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! being in university thus what Uzaki wants to do for fun though mostly in the anime template still has it&#039;s REALLY funny moments at times and along with the MANY innuendoes both visual and verbal and the great amount of character jabbing at the expense of Sakurai and the awkward settings Sakurai gets into thanks to Uzaki (sometimes Sakurai&#039;s own doing), the comedic timing of Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! was just on point and better yet we have audience surrogates of Ami and Sakaki for those who wants to just see as a bystander (Ami) and those who wants to push their relationship (Sakaki)<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! does nudge the relationship angle between Uzaki and Sakurai alot and though in a meta-sense that Ami and Sakaki also wanting to push that in their own way, the anime DOES dive a little deep into Uzaki and Sakurai&#039;s relationship including why Uzaki even wanted to help Sakurai have a fun university life thus instigating the entire &quot;plot&quot; of Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! in the first place which was in itself a nice touch in their relationship.<br />
<br />
Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! may be minimalistic but what it lacks in &quot;plot&quot; it adds itself to the execution of the premise and it&#039;s lovable characters.<br />
<br />
The animation done by Studio ENGI and really for their SECOND animation job, it pretty standout, sure it&#039;s not exactly action packed and it&#039;s more or less a comedy but the comedic timing for the animations to it&#039;s vibrant character designs especially with all the outfits the cast goes through. Nonetheless ENGI&#039;s animation was juuuust right for this anime and rightfully so.<br />
<br />
The voice cast though as minimalistic as the &quot;plot&quot; the voice cast of Naomi Oozora and Kenji Akabane pretty much carried the anime, what with Naomi&#039;s smug but genki as all hell cadence to Kenji&#039;s one liner quips towards Uzaki was on point and to that end, Ayana Taketatsu also bounced VERY well between Kenji and Naomi&#039;s roles in this anime as well with finally Saori Hayami rounding things up as Uzaki&#039;s mom bounced off VERY nicely with the rest of the cast as the oblivious &quot;out of the loop&quot; ojou mother to Keni Akanae and Naomi Oozora&#039;s antics in their respective roles. Really as minimalistic as this voice cast is, it&#039;s bulk and greatness comes from the seiyuu&#039;s themselves and the great comedic timings of the cast only made this anime WAAAAAY better.<br />
<br />
Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! is but a simple anime, but a simple anime that executes itself VERY well for what it does with it&#039;s characters. Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! being one of the more memable animes of Summer 2020 at that and with a lovable and funny main cast such as this akin to Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san. This was probably LA&#039;s favourite comedy anime for Summer 20202 with Uzaki and Ami being waifu material at that to boot and better yet since a second season has been announced, more antics await us with Uzaki wanting to hang out even more~!!!<br />

    TL;DR Amazing rom-com and the rumors/things people are saying are simply not true. Give it a watch, give it a read and see it for yourself. Its funny, adorable, and truly one of the best romances I&#039;ve seen in a long time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Firstly I need to say do not listen to the ridiculous things people say about this story/characters. People are acting like they&#039;ve never seen an anime girl with large breasts and that their very existence is a crime against humanity. Also there is little to ZERO fanservice, I honestly think these people don&#039;t even read the manga or watch the anime. That being said

          <span style="display: none;" id="review353597">
        I will continue.<br />
<br />
The premise is simple, boy and girl meet in the past, become friends, and later start to develop feelings for each other. Fast forward to the present they are both enrolled at a University and still maintain their friendship on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
The characters: oh my lord are they awesome. Funny, cute, and just amazingly written for this type of rom-com. They mimic the type of relationship we all want, being in love with your best friend. This works fantastically and makes you envy their situation/laugh your ass off. There are a few side characters that give life to the settings and move it along.<br />
<br />
Even though its the classic trope of &quot;boy loves girl, girl loves boy but they take forever confirming their feelings&quot; its sooooo worth the read/watch if you like rom-coms. They are so adorable together its almost a crime, plus they are hilarious.<br />
<br />
I mean its a simple enough plot but it&#039;s such a breath of fresh air to see two characters in a romance story not be all dramatic about every little thing that happens in every chapter.<br />
<br />
All in all if you usually like romance and/or rom-com anime/manga I HIGHLY recommend this. I also recommend reading the manga as it&#039;s further ahead and you get to see some more cute scenes.<br />
<br />
Lastly, again, don&#039;t listen to all the haters who for some reason have a problem with a college student with large breasts but still think highschool girls with the bodies of 24 yr old victoria&#039;s secret models are correctly proportionate ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
