     This is an interesting series to review.  First because I think a lot of people are going to read the summery of this show and dismiss it right away without even giving it a try and that is really a shame.  As far as romances go this is one of the more satisfying series I have watched.<br />

Let’s face it that for a large number of people the student teacher romance that is the core of this show is probably going to offend or at the least make people feel a little uncomfortable.  With so many high profile real life cases, this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9477">
        sort of thing doesn’t feel like the innocent school crush that I think almost everyone (boy or girl) had for a teacher at their school at some point in their life.  To be honest I felt a little uncomfortable at times with it.  Even though they do point out that Kei is 18 and do to an illness that caused him to miss 3 years of school he was held back.  So legally at least no laws are being broken I suppose.<br />
<br />
The premise of the story is, well to put it bluntly, one of the silliest if not the silliest I have ever seen in an anime (and that’s saying something really).  But what develops out of this turns into a very touching romance as both develop their love and feelings for one another.  The supporting characters also have romances of their own and it was refreshing to see a show in which all the female characters were not in love with the same guy.  The whole alien aspect of the show and Mizuho&#039;s really reason for being on earth is really just a small subplot of the series and the story is pretty much totally focused on the romantic elements.  Which is great!  Also you might think a show like this would be pretty echii but it really isn’t, which was a pleasant surprise for me.  Sure there is fan service but it’s pretty tame for the most part.  There are a lot of adult themes as well so this isn’t a show for kids.<br />
<br />
The show does a great job in developing all its characters.  The two leads and the main supporting characters all get fleshed out very nicely and by the end of the series I really felt they changed and grew.  This is really a strong point of the show.  However a couple things did annoy me that forced me to knock down the rating I gave it a little.  One, Kei constantly refers to Mizuho as Sensei, even when they are alone and intimate.  I expected him to grow in this way but with few exceptions he almost never refers to her by her name.  I know that may sound like a silly thing to some but I think it’s important.  In addition it constantly reminds you of the whole indecency of the relationship I talked about above.  Also Kei is also kind of an annoying wussy.<br />
<br />
The acting is pretty good, Kei&#039;s voice actor is not that great.  He kind of reinforces the whole weakling aspect of his character that got on my nerves as the show went on.  The music shines though, with KOTOKO and Mami Kawada doing the songs pretty much saves my view of the overall sound.  The art is great too, especially Mizuho and her mother.  I love Mizuho&#039;s school hairstyle and dress!  Again Kei suffers here as well as sometimes he almost looks like a girl.<br />
<br />
I think I could have gone higher in my rating on this show, but really some of the discomfort I felt about the story takes away from my overall enjoyment of this series.  But don’t get me wrong this was a great show!  If you even like romance anime even a little you should watch this.<br />

    Onegai Teacher review by realanimefan.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Well there is an alternative title to this Anime, and Onegai Teacher is the English title, it&amp;amp;rsquo;s actually Onegai Teichiya. I would actually rate this into my top 5 best watch Animes but since my favourite Animes to watch are romance ones, some of you probably won\&#039;t agree me then but if you are a lover of romantic Animes like me, then you should have a watch of this.  This series starts of with a 15 year old boy named Kei Kusanagi who is a normal boy that encountered an UFO as he was relaxing near the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review511">
        lake, that UFO appeared to be their new Japanese teacher; Mizuho Kazami.  Those two end up falling in love together.  Each episode brings some laughs as well as some really touching scenes, and some that might be for older viewer, if you know what I mean ;).  I don\&#039;t want to release all the info or else I\&#039;ll put you off or spoil it for you, so that&amp;amp;rsquo;s all I am going to write but if you really into romance, then this anime could be for you.  In my opinion, I found this Anime very touching similar to &amp;quot;Kimi Ga Nozumu Eien&amp;quot;, if you liked that Anime, then you should give \&#039;Onegai Teacher\&#039; a shot and you\&#039;ll probably enjoy it.  There is also are part 2 for this Anime called Onegai Twins, you should give it a watch as well, it will be explained in the other review, please read it.  Hopefully this has provided you with a good look at what the Anime is like.  Please have a good watch, all you Anime people out there.<br />

    Onegai Teacher is an alright show with some interesting ideas and some good characters, but it&#039;s wrapped in a completely ridiculous scenario.<br />
<br />
The premise behind the events in Onegai Teacher is pretty absurd.  Oh, the alien side of things is OK, if fairly standard. There&#039;s nothing much to either endorse or complain about that.  But I could not suspend my disbelief for any decent amount of time over Kei&#039;s illness, it was just soo silly.  I don&#039;t like the &#039;mystery illness&#039; plot device as a whole because it always seems so very contrived, and Kei&#039;s illness has convenience and contrivity coming out the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review17953">
        wahzoo.  Even though we get a faily bare bones explanation of what the disease is, what sort of stress brings on a standstill is applied pretty inconsistantly.<br />
<br />
Fourtunately the show sidelines the illness for the first half of the show and concentrates on the characters.  Aside from episode 4 being oh so very convenient, this part of the show is alright.  But when we get to the reason behind the illness, it&#039;s difficult to take seriously.  The conclusion to this is done via the introduction of a new character we only saw previously in a couple 1 second flashbacks.  Because we know so little about this character and the relationship between Kei, this part of the plot loses a lot of impact.  However, that part of the story does have a sound basis so it&#039;s not too bad.  If the illness itself wasn&#039;t so absurd that part of the story would have been much better.<br />
<br />
Where the show does shine is the characters.  The relationship between Kei and Mizuho starts off quite timidly and grows at a steady pace, and even though the Hyosuke and Kaede thing comes out of nowhere the show runs with it and makes does a good job of it.  The group of friends work quite well together.  The only characters that didn&#039;t come off well were Ichigo and Mahou.  Ichigo was just too flat and emotionless to be convincing, and I didn&#039;t like Mahou at all.  I assume she was supposed to be a character like Skuld from Oh! My Goddess, but instead of coming off as someone who adores her sister, she looks like a vindictive, possesive bitch.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s nothing much to say about the animation and artwork.  They both do their jobs well, if not standout.  Thought character designs do a good job of making each character look quite unique, and the artwork is quite colouful.  The music compliments the show, but it&#039;s pretty standard stuff.  The OP and ED are alright, but again, nothing particuarly great abou them.<br />
<br />
The dub work was good overall.  Bridget Hoffman does a fantasitic job as Mizuho Kazami, she portrays her timid earnestness very well.  Ichigo&#039;s voice was far too deadpan, even for her character and Kei did sound a little too weedy, but the others did a good job overall.<br />
<br />
The underpinnings of Onegai Teacher are too silly to take seriously, but it&#039;s got some good characters in it and some amusing jokes so it&#039;s not all bad.  More a reccomnedation for fans of the romance genre.

    Story<br />
Onegai Teacher is a love story about a forbidden relationship between a teacher and her student.  Their relationship starts out as a cover up, but grows into something much deeper and meaningful.  There is a fair share of comedic moments, twists, and misunderstandings, but this story is essentially about their marriage: its highs and lows, happy and sad moments, fights and makeups.  <br />
<br />
It is a very short series, only 12 episodes long, so there is no elaborate plot.  The alien aspect does not even play that big of a role.  They are merely devices used to create obstacles in their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5458">
        marriage.  Sometimes these obstacles can be annoying since they seem to drag the series out in the middle and stunt the relationship development.  However, they do a really great job of giving you a lot of ooh and ahh moments where you are overwhelmed with the amount of cuteness as well as suspenseful moments when you just want to scream at the tv.  <br />
<br />
Art and Sound<br />
When it comes to reviewing art and sound, I admit I am not the best judge.  I tend to think of the two elements as enhancers rather than essentials.  However, I will say that I never felt like the art or sound clashed with the story.  It seemed like they fit well and created a believable world.  There were a lot of attractive characters in this anime and very little fan service.  The OP was pretty good too, it kind of reminded me of Air (others will probably disagree).<br />
<br />
Character<br />
I won&#039;t lie, I watch anime for the characters.  Everything else takes a backseat for me.  I have to feel like I can relate to the characters and that they could be real people that I would hang out with.  Onegai Teacher&#039;s characters were the real selling point for me.  If I could describe them in one word, I would say they are all adorable.  The main characters are two people whose relationship you really want to watch develop as it can be described as an honest, caring exchange between two people who are trying to get to know each other and discover feelings within themselves that they struggle to come to grips with.  The director does a great job of putting you into the heads of the characters and if you are empathetic enough, you can really feel what the characters are feeling.  I think the best part for me was that I felt like their relationship was realistic as both of them weren&#039;t shy enough to be obnoxious but weren&#039;t falling for each other easily either.  It was clearly a mutual exchange of feelings that came about gradually.  <br />
<br />
The other characters were also a great supporting cast.  The &amp;quot;other girl&amp;quot; was very cute and if the two main characters weren&#039;t married then you wouldn&#039;t mind Kei getting together with her.  I don&#039;t want to spoil the show, but let&#039;s just say that love is all around in this series.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
This anime really serves its purpose well.  It is easy watching and leaves you with  good feelings after almost ever episode.  I smiled a lot while I watched it and I have to say that the little alien dolls were so cute that they made me laugh every time.  If you are someone who is looking for a good romance and likes to laugh, cry, and empathize with characters then you will love Onegai Teacher.  Also, if you are one of those people who has ever had a crush on a teacher (who hasn&#039;t) then you will probably also like this show.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
I started watching this show because I heard some people referring to it after an episode of Gurren Lagann and I thought it sounded like good fun.  In the end, the series is short, but it is oh so sweet.  Highly recommended.<br />

    &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot; is a series I avoided watching for a quite a while despite its popularity at the time I was getting into anime. One of the reason I avoided it was because back then, I didn&#039;t think I would like romance anime. Eventually, I came across it being aired on an internet TV channel. So I watched it. And I hated it. Now, several years on, and having watched and liked plenty of anime of the romance genre, I&#039;ve come to realise that it&#039;s not anime romance that I hate per se - it&#039;s bad anime romance. And the romance in &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot; isn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37292">
        just bad... it&#039;s diabolical.<br />
<br />
But then, what do you expect, given the premises of &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot; (which, by the way, is my second reason for avoiding it for so long)? I mean... just look at its synopsis: An undercover alien - and it just so happens that she&#039;s a beautiful woman - who is working as a teacher has her secret identity discovered by a student. And this students ends up having to marry her in order to protect her... this has got to be a bad joke right? RIGHT? Sadly, it&#039;s not even a joke - the anime is dead serious about its story, and it is every bit as ridiculous as the synopsis suggests. So anyone who is put off by that should probably avoid this show at all cost (unless they&#039;re up for a good laugh about how bad it is). <br />
<br />
Rather unsurprisingly, the worst aspect of &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot; is its farcical story. The whole student marrying his fit teacher scenario is obviously a fantasy of forbidden love lifted straight out of someone&#039;s head and, like a typical fantasy of this type, it&#039;s seriously lacking in the coherency department. The whole thing is weakly held together by gimmicks, contrived twists and bucketload of cliched coincidences and compromising situations of the type often found in harems.<br />
<br />
Hand in hand with the bullsh*t story is a weak cast of characters. Thanks to the unbelievably convoluted storyline, the characters are little more than poor puppets, constantly doing inexplicable things for inexplicable reasons, just so that the latest &quot;twist&quot; will keep the story on its intended track. As a result, most of them come off as horribly unconvincing. <br />
<br />
The majority of the characters have undeveloped personalities. The severity of the underdevelopment seems inversely proportional to the amount of screen time for the most part. Topping the leaderboard, we have the main characters Kei (the student) and Mizuho (the teacher). Kei is your average harem lead type loser, with a personality so bland that perhaps the most remarkable thing about him is how utterly unremarkable he is. Oh yeah, he&#039;s also armed with what&#039;s got to be one of the biggest character plot device gimmick ever - his &quot;stand still&quot; syndrome, which I nearly forgot about due to the overpowering blandness of his personality. As for Mizuho, note that the second half of the opening credits of &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot; mostly consist of her in various cute poses as though she&#039;s modelling for some &quot;Monthly Moe&quot; magazine... and that pretty much sums up what she does for most of the show neatly - even her voice sounds like that of a pr0n star.<br />
<br />
At the other end of the spectrum, we have the ship constrol system with an overdeveloped personality. The ship control system actually has a physical form - it&#039;s an obnoxious little... thing (for lack of a better word) called Maria. Despite just being a ship control system, it&#039;s been given a personality that, amongst other things, has a tendency to meddle in people&#039;s lives... presumably so that it can give the story a convenient push in the right direction when it needs it. It&#039;s probably meant to be a amusing, cute little mascot, but as you may have guessed already, I found it to be an annoying little sh*t instead.<br />
<br />
The only character that I kinda liked is Herikawa, whose personality seems genuine enough that I was able to sympathise with her problems. I found out later that she is voiced by my favourite voice actress, so that might have something to do with it. Another character worth mentioning is only worth mentioning for being outstandingly annoying - it&#039;s that ultra cliched girl with the monotonous voice. I honestly don&#039;t see the point in those type of characters, and I can&#039;t even begin to describe how that flat, emotionless voice grated on my nerves. <br />
<br />
Good characterisation are often backed up good script. The reverse is also true. The piss poor characters of &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot; is underlined by its corny, lathargically repetitive script. In addition to having one of the lamest catch phrases ever - &quot;It&#039;s top priority!&quot; or &quot;It&#039;s very important&quot; depending on the translation (and it&#039;s one that doesn&#039;t improve with highly repetitive use either) - half the dialogues seem to involve calling Kei an idiot in one way or another. Most of the character&#039;s own monologues also involve calling Kei an idiot. OK! OK! I get it already - Kei&#039;s an idiot... I could have told you that from about 2 min into the first episode! Also, about half the epsiodes seems to end with our &quot;hero&quot; saying things along the lines of &quot;It finally feels like the teacher and I are moving on!&quot; Well, they seem to have trouble moving on from the same two lines in the script, let alone anything else!<br />
<br />
The one good aspect of &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot; is the music. Even though I didn&#039;t think the opening theme was all that, the rest of the music is several leagues above the story content in terms of quality. There&#039;s not much to complain about the animation either, though Mizuho&#039;s hair colour stands out in a bad way for being pink/purple. All these matters little though, as the story and the characters are what makes &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot; an unsalvageable wreck. <br />
<br />
Ultimately, &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot; is as bad, if not worse, than its title and synoposis suggest. It&#039;s an abomination of a romantic comedy where the attempted romance drama fails miserably thanks to its ludicrous story, and where the comedy is as lame as a legless camel (I suppose you could argue that&#039;s gone beyond lame, but lets not be too pedantic). Still, I can&#039;t deny that I laughed quite a lot - not with it, but at it, because it&#039;s one of those shows that&#039;s so bad it&#039;s actually really, really funny.<br />
<br />
One thing that does surprise me about &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot; though, is that it doesn&#039;t contain any obvious fanservice despite the nature of its premises. But if you&#039;re disappointed to hear that, don&#039;t worry - there&#039;s an OVA episode that makes up for this oversight... but that&#039;s another review for another day.<br />

    This anime is definitely a classic.  I would have to say that if you are a fan of a romantic, fantasy, ecchi, and comedy genres, then you will love this series.  The animation is bright and very colorful, just like the characters.  The story works on a multitude of levels.  It seems surprising to me how many topic this touches on, and I won&#039;t give any of them away.  You&#039;ll just have to watch the series to find out.  <br />
While not trying to give anything away,  there are characters who have very serious moments, but also have those

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1450">
        comedic moments thrown in there as well.  The way in which the characters react stay fluid, and by the end I felt as though I was going to miss watching them.<br />
It definitely has it&#039;s ups and downs, and the ride is amazing.  While the plot tends to get really deep, it not afraid to peak back up at the surface for just a little fun, especially in the OVA.  One last note, if you&#039;re looking for the dubbed version it&#039;s Please Teacher, but if you&#039;re looking for the subbed it&#039;s Onegai Teacher.

    Alright lets do this! ^.^ but before I begin reviewing, this is my first ever review on MAL ^.^ on the anime that got me into this obsessive addiction &gt;.&lt; haha so already this is going to be a positive review :] <br />
<br />
<br />
Story - 9 (Great)<br />
The story of Onegai Teacher! revolves around 18 year old Kei Kusanagi who has the appearance of a 15 year old boy, this is due to a rare disease  known as &#039;Standstill&#039; which causes comatose (basically falling into a coma) whenever he is under severe emotional distress.<br />
<br />
Before the story, Kei has been in a Standstill for 3 years due

          <span style="display: none;" id="review47289">
        to a serious harsh event (which will be reveal in the story so don&#039;t worry), once he woke up he discovers its already been 3 years and a-lot has changed especially highschool, as most of his friends are already at university which causes a-lot of social awkwardness and difficulties. Failing to keep up with everyone, he decides to lead a new life and start highschool all over again and moves to live with his aunt and uncle who owns a medical clinic.<br />
<br />
Kei slowly settles in with his aunt and uncle at the clinic while even making some new friends from school but scared of being outcasted again, he keeps his real age hidden. (At the start of the story) One night Kei is sat/laid near a lake thinking about something one of his friends was saying to him, due to this he starts getting emotionally distressed and slowly starts going into a standstill. BUT! suddenly gusts of winds! and whirlpools forms in the lake, then a mysterious beautiful woman slowly appears (teleport-like) in-front of him.<br />
<br />
Not knowing what the hellokitty is going on, he runs for his life and while trying to escape Kei falls into a lake but the beautiful woman rescues him and even sends him back home in secret without him even knowing. Believing that all this was just a dream he goes to school as usual the next morning but all of a sudden Kei&#039;s new homeroom teacher and j moved in next-door neighbour is the same mysterious woman from his so-called dream ^.^<br />
<br />
Okay, thats basically the first 5 minutes of the anime :] so i leave the rest for you to watch ^.^ but basically the theme of Onegai Teacher! will be revolving around the relationship between student (Kei - 18 years old so don&#039;t worry) and teacher (Mizuho - the mysterious beautiful woman), because of the taboo relationship we will see some comedic moments of Kei and Mizuho trying to keep their relationship a secret from Kei&#039;s friend as well as some heart-warming moments of their love for each other. There are also other themes of this anime, but not wanting to spoil anything, i leave them out for you to find this out by yourself ^.^<br />
<br />
<br />
Art - 7.5 (Good)<br />
The artstyle and animation is fairly good considering this came out in early 2002, the artstyle however isn&#039;t anything to be amazed by, but they are still pretty good to look at :] the characters are all fairly drawn realistically like normal hairstyles (nothing OTT) with ordinary hair colours (apart from Mizuho with red hair) like blonde, brunette, and even ginger! :] Since the anime focus on the relationship between Kei and Mizuho, you can expect some change in scenery from the highschool classroom, to hotels on the beach, and even space and beyond ;] haha<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound - 8 (Very Good)<br />
The soundtrack sets the atmosphere well from comedic moments to serious ones, for most part the soundtrack really makes Onegai Teacher! More vibrant but there will also be some dark tones during some moments in Onegai Teacher! but those aren&#039;t really what i wanted to talk about, but instead the opening theme as well as some of the insert songs because those or more specifically the opening theme was the selling point (personally) for me. The opening theme was &quot;Shooting Star&quot; by Kotoko has this upbeat trance and the first time i heard it, i loved it and had to watch the anime for it ^.^ she also does a few of the insert songs somewhere near the end of Onegai Teacher! and that was also very lovely and made a impact on the mood and atmosphere, the ending is performed by Mami Kawada which was very sweet and calm to every ending of each episode :]<br />
<br />
<br />
Character - 8 (Very Good)<br />
I don’t really want to go into depths of each and every of the characters because well that’s for you to find out for yourself :] and I’m sure you don’t want to read over 9000 paragraphs of in-depth character analysis, I mean seriously this isn’t a college essay :P but all I can say is that most of the characters are love-able apart from one that I guarantee you will dislike but she will redeem herself later on (well less annoying should I say) but overall most of the characters especially Kei’s friends you will love them :] oh and also Mr Yamada one of the teachers at the school who you will defiantly love too ^.^ most of them will be useful to the story while a few are just for comedic purposes :]<br />
<br />
The voice acting (English dub, haven’t watched it in Japanese dub) for most of the characters were surprisingly well, they each suited the characters personality especially Mizuho and Kei… maybe a-bit too well for Kei, at times it sounded a little too whiney and did sometimes ruin the romantic moment a little when Kei and Mizuho are staring into each other eyes and saying their names out-loud “oh miss Mizuho” *cringe* &gt;.&lt; haha<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment – 9 (Great) and Overall – 8 (Very Good)<br />
If you are a fan of romance anime, this is one you should not miss out on! This has been in the top five of recommended romance anime :] I greatly enjoyed the story as it showed the good points, bad points and the struggles of the character’s relationship (and I don’t just mean Kei and Mizuho but Kei’s friends too), and I even felt for the characters emotion how they felt, I really loved the music especially the opening theme ^.^ after all that’s what made me watch the anime in the first place :D Overall this is a fairly good anime :] but too me it’s an amazing anime that I will always remember :]<br />
<br />

    Here is what Onegai Teacher is all about:<br />
<br />
-Boy meets girl, girl meets boy<br />
-Boy and girl get married when they hardly know each other<br />
-Boy and girl hide their relationship from others<br />
-Boy gets jealous when girl meets another boy<br />
-Girl gets jealous when boy meets another girl<br />
-Girl and boy constantly misunderstand each other<br />
-Love triangles<br />
<br />
The boy is a high school student, and the girl is an alien teacher. But so what? The story ultimately follows the same &#039;ol formula.<br />
<br />
It is unfortunate that there are no teacher/student romance premises in anime that can be taken a little seriously or have thoughtful stories. They’re usually way too light-hearted and focus on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29664">
        comedy and fanservice. That actually isn&#039;t the case with Onegai Teacher, but it still has an awful lot of annoyances.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
So Kei coincidentally discovers his teacher (aka Mizuho) when she lands on Earth, and Mizuho coincidentally moves into a house next door to him. And of course, Kei coincidentally finds out her real identity and purpose.<br />
<br />
What leads to them getting married?  Let’s see…they get locked in a gym room together, the principal discovers them and thinks it’s too suspicious, and to protect Mizuho from getting punished, Kei says that they’re married. His story is that he’s really 18 years old, and he lost three years of his life due to an illness where he loses consciousness after experiencing high stress. So legally speaking, it’s actually okay for them to be married. And guess what? Kei’s guardians (his step-parents) are incredibly supportive, and his envious step-dad encourages him to be sexual with his teacher. What kind of guardians are those?<br />
<br />
Kei spends the entire series trying to hide his relationship with Mizuho from his group of friends who have nothing but dating on the brain. And this goes on constantly. They can never take a vacation anywhere or relax at home because his friends are always there. The scenes with them just become highly repetitive and uninteresting. And just as you might expect, one of Kei’s school friends falls in love with him. This leads to a lot of “Oh no, my teacher just saw me in a trapped situation with this girl, and now she has the completely wrong idea!!” In fact, there are way too many misunderstandings like that, and after a while, they&#039;re just silly and tiresome.<br />
<br />
So here’s the bottom line. The story is a typical love triangle fest.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
Kei is a polite, reserved kid who lets others take control of him, but he can react more aggressively when he wants to. He tends to analyze his situations to make the best out of them, and he shows his serious side a lot. In all honesty, he isn&#039;t a bad character, but his illness that makes him faint all the time is overdone.<br />
<br />
Mizuho is certainly not what I expected. Despite her being a teacher, she’s very timid, sensitive, and “cute.” Her alien-related business isn&#039;t what’s important in the story, it’s just her ability to use teleportation so she can conveniently show up wherever Kei is, or teleport them out of sticky situations. While she doesn’t seem all that bad at first, she quickly turns annoying when she gets jealous of Kei hanging out with girls, or when Kei gets a kiss on the cheek from her sister. I’ve seen her teary eyes way too many times. What’s the point of making her a special character if she’s just going to act like a melodramatic crybaby? However, her younger sister is by far the most annoying character in this show. She’s just there to be loud and make sure that her relationship with Kei doesn’t move forward at all.<br />
<br />
Kei’s friends get a lot of attention as well, but they’re just ordinary. Their development isn&#039;t all that interesting to watch, and they exist only to cause Kei and Mizuho problems 99% of the time.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the point of the show is to make the characters feel as unbelievable as possible. Besides Mizuho being an alien, Kei’s guardians are way too relaxed about his marriage. And even when Kei and Mizuho start feeling genuine love for each other, I don&#039;t believe their feelings. Why DO they love each other? Nothing ever logically adds up to their feelings. I don&#039;t get it.<br />
<br />
ATMOSPHERE &amp; MUSIC<br />
<br />
This anime is all about the drama. You can definitely feel the dark undertones becoming more and more apparent as the story progresses. Sure, there is also comedy and fanservice, but they’re toned down for the most part…which is a nice surprise.<br />
<br />
The opening song sounds very pleasant and melodic; it makes you feel like you’re really watching some classic from the early 2000s, but that’s about it. I recall hearing a decent techno track a couple times, but the other sounds aren’t memorable enough to write about.<br />
<br />
OVERALL<br />
<br />
Onegai Teacher felt like a waste of time. The drama is silly, repetitive, and it degrades the teacher down to acting like a melodramatic crybaby and worrier. The story relies too heavily on coincidences, accidents, and devices used merely for convenience. Kei conveniently faints all the time, Mizuho conveniently uses teleportation, Kei’s friends coincidentally show up wherever they are, misunderstandings arise from accidental sightings, love triangles pop up, etc. But if this is your kinda thing, then go for it.<br />

    Before I begin this review I’d like to thank Google for helping me find this show completely by accident (honestly though, I’d prefer it if you didn’t ask what I was really looking for).<br />
<br />
Onegai Teacher (or Please Teacher for the U.S release) is the logical conclusion of all the wet dream scenarios of lonely students who wanted to bone their teacher in high school and the producers who wanted to make a profit off of them. Since I, like possibly most of the people reading this was a lonely guy in high school that had no date this story concept immediately appealed to my sensibilities

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36794">
        as a nerd. I watched it, yet I hated it. Publicly denounced it, yet continued to indulge in the guilty pleasure. This is probably the first bad review I’ve written where I’ve actually watched the anime from beginning to end. And why is that? Because this is the scariest fucking anime I have ever watched in my life. Allow me to explain<br />
<br />
The soon-to-be-victim in this tragic affair is Kei Kusanagi, an eighteen-year-old high school student who suffers from seizures that he calls “stand-stills” (yeah, they’re called seizures dude), wears glasses and has a pale complexion. So, basically the Anthony Michael Hall of high school characters, but of course his life is about to change. Enter Mizuho Kazami, who has a mysterious past but it is implied that she’s trying to leave behind her career in pornography where she had to take it from behind by two bald guys ten years her senior in order to pursue her dream of becoming a teacher. Oh yeah, she also lives right next door to Kei in his neighborhood and has the hots for him. Really? REALLY?? Really, really? Kei doesn’t even try to woo her besides help her move into her house. All he does that can even come close to a come on is that he trips and plants his head right into her cleavage, which from what I’ve read it is required by law to have at least one of these scenes in all harem or romance anime. <br />
<br />
So these two start holding hands and breathing on each other for the first few episodes which is pretty much the equivalent of them having hot Amish sex until they’re caught by Kei’s legal guardians. To cover up the fact that Mizuho is a cradle robber in return for making sure Kei gets an A in her class they decide that Kei and Mizuho need to get married. But, they have to keep it a secret to avoid a scandal. Oh boy, here comes the hijinks! The rest of the series is twelve episodes of giving the male viewers blue balls while they live vicariously through Kei the-MILF-Master Kusanagi. <br />
<br />
But, don’t be fooled because that is only half of the story. In fact, did you know that Mizuho is an alien? Yeah, that’s right, a fucking alien! No, I did not just make that up, nor did I pull some M. Night Shyamalan shit on you. It’s made clear pretty much from the beginning that Mizuho is in fact an alien and she wants Kei to stick every inch of his manhood into her hot reptilian vajayjay. It almost kind of makes sense, since the story takes place around the year 2011. What’s the shit that girls can’t get enough of in 2011? Twilight. Mizuho probably beamed that book up when she tried to study up on what human females find attractive and logically concluded that human males that look like Edward Cullen get massive pussy. It would also make sense that Mizuho would want to jump Kei’s bones because according to Twilight it’s perfectly acceptable to act like a total pedophile and bang a high school student because Kei is of course the most desirable male among the other students. She has been slowly seducing Kei throughout the series: wearing revealing outfits and squeezing her boobs together when the opportunity presents itself. All while wearing her fake human skin to attract unwitting human males. Why does she do all of this? Because her planet is dying. Yes, her being there to simply study the humans is a smoke-screen. In fact the only reason she is there is to breed with the humans on Earth in order to propagate her species. Though Kei even though he does know probably doesn’t mind the arrangement: He gets sex from an older woman who superficially anyway, looks smoking hot and cares about him. However, it’ll be pretty awkward when Mizuho and Kei have kids and he has to explain to the nurse at the hospital why they all look like human-xenomorph-hybrids. Along with the male killing ritual that&#039;s tradition on Mizuho&#039;s homeworld after she successfully conceives the children of her mate. <br />
<br />
In conclusion: worse Species remake EVER! <br />

    Onegai Teacher is a comedy of errors, or as I like to refer to it, a comedy of &quot;if these characters had a single brain cell between them this situation could be resolved quickly and without any of this stupidity.&quot; Of course most people just use comedy of errors because it&#039;s catchier.<br />
<br />
Basically there&#039;s a young man named Kei who looks like a teenager because he has plot convenience disease which causes his body to enter into suspended animation who&#039;s going to High School because his three years in suspended animation caused him to miss finishing the first time. He ends up married to his teacher

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37591">
        who&#039;s an alien from another planet because he saw her ship land and they got caught in a situation that looked bad and they couldn&#039;t think of a better story to tell the principle than the old &quot;we&#039;re actually married lie.&quot; It&#039;s jut as idiotic as it sounds if not more-so.<br />
<br />
You&#039;re probably thinking, is it at least funny? No, not really. The entire series has a few semi-amusing moments but it&#039;s mostly non-humour that revolves around the situation being awkward. The art in the series is decent, although they do use the &quot;cut out content for fan-service&quot; strategy. Like Bakuretsu Hunters, Onegai Teacher tries to be mostly comedic with some drama and it doesn&#039;t work. The &quot;serious&quot; moments are under-mined by the sheer idiocy of the whole thing. The voice acting is passable, but nothing special.<br />
<br />
The Yuri Factor:<br />
<br />
Onegai Teacher is one of those series where all the female characters are one dimensional love interests for the men. In all fairness the men aren&#039;t much more developed and this could just be the result of Shizuru Hayashiya being an incompetent writer. There is no yuri. 1/10<br />
<br />
Overall I give this series a 3/10. It&#039;s bad but the art and voice acting are decent. The music is also kind of good but the rest of the series is so atrocious that a 3/10 is generous.

    I really enjoyed this anime and  was not expecting to since I usually do NOT like Ecchi. But this anime really rose above my expectations. It was a nice surprise. <br />
<br />
Bad points first:<br />
<br />
Yes, there are some bad points, though some of them get fixed along the series. So I&#039;ll just point here the bad points that didn&#039;t get fixed.<br />
<br />
- I really don&#039;t think they needed the whole alien thing. The sensei being an alien is just a detail that works as a plot device at times. The story doesn&#039;t need it and if they had gotten rid of it and just dealt with the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review48453">
        situations without it this anime would be a &quot;slice of life&quot; genre classic now. As it is using the alien thing as a fix for some situations ends up coming across as lazy writing. It&#039;s a real pity.<br />
<br />
- I was disappointed they didn&#039;t focus a bit more seriously on the taboo side of it (even if Kei is 18, legal age). I really would love to have seen a bit more of them defending their marriage against society. The fact that they manage to keep it a secret successfully is unreal...I mean, he is a high school student married with his teacher on a small town...and NO ONE KNOWS?!? This is unreal. I really would love to see they confronting society prejudice an sticking together...oh well :\<br />
<br />
- What is the deal with the backstabbing mother...like WHAT???<br />
<br />
Good Points:<br />
<br />
I have lot to say here, because as I said this anime was a nice surprise.<br />
 <br />
- The Ecchi factor was there but it was very mild and didn&#039;t bother all that much. Plus not all the females love the lead which is great. It really surprised me.<br />
<br />
- The leading male character Kei Kusanagi, I really liked him. I love that the romantic male lead is a common guy, real common. He is not the funny guy, he is not the smart but quiet guy, he is not the bad boy or the great noble guy, he is definitely not the strong  fighter guy. Kei is quiet but friendly, smart but not a good student, strong willed when he has to, not afraid to fight with sensei (refreshing since most of anime boys are whipped), and he is frail because of his health issues. I love it!! I hate that most people think that to be a good lead the guy must be Naruto/Goku/Lelouch. Hurray for imperfect people as leads in animes o/<br />
<br />
-The leading female character Kazami-sensei, well I don&#039;t love her since she is the subject of most of the fan service AND she is twenty-something acting and blushing like a teen (really? REALLY???), BUT I did find myself warming up to her. She is not afraid to admit her feelings, and she is not afraid to act on said feelings, those are BIG plusses for me. She loves her man, she wants to keep her man, she is not afraid to say it and she is not afraid to act on it...You go girl!!!<br />
<br />
-A lot of characters at first seem like stereotypes, especially Maho as the annoying, spoiled, overbearing sister. However, most of the characters, even Maho, evolve, change in one way or another. Some of the secondary characters have storylines of their own and they are actually interesting. I especially liked Hyosuke and Kaede’s storyline, I would even watch an anime just about the two of them. I really liked Hyosuke, you start thinking he is the typical comic relief dumb friend because of the way he acts, but he is the most intelligent of the group, a fun guy who is actually gentle and really sweet with his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
- I love that girls here are humanized on this. It is not perfect, but it was pretty good for an anime. In most romance animes girls fall into three stereotypes (that I really don’t like): the girls that stare at the guy they love from a distance with teary eyes too afraid to even speak in front of the guy; the girl that get mad that they like a guy and are constantly ripping the guy a new one and beating him with whatever they can find; the third are the girls that are completely clueless, they act like they don’t know what “liking someone” is, they’re doe eyed and seem to not know that their actions influence other people (or how people actually reproduce), those are the ones that respond to a love confession with “I also love you. You’re a great friend” (while I’m thinking: kill her off, please kill her off). Onegai teacher has none of those stereotypes, the girls on OT are aware of their own actions and of others actions towards them. They like guys and they act on their feelings. They confess, they get disappointed, they fight for what they want. It was really refreshing, I was really happy with how the female characters personalities and actions were treated on this anime.<br />
<br />
-Finally a romance anime where things actually happen. I’m sick of animes where you wait and watch and what you get is 2 characters holding hands after 15 episodes...DAMN. Taking from the animes, sometimes I wonder if the Japanese people spring out of rocks instead of having sex, because the poor male characters have to work so damn hard to get a girl to hold his hand let alone kiss...Are Japanese girls made of ice??? I love that in Onegai teacher they hold hands, fight, kiss, have sex, all done in a surprisingly mild and tasteful way. <br />
<br />
WELL, TO SUM UP, It will not be the best anime you will ever see, that’s for sure, but it will leave you with the feeling of resolution, something you don&#039;t always get watching animes. The characters change and evolve, most of the storylines get closure, the couples do more than look at each other dreamily, and it all feels very satisfying. <br />

    Onegai☆Teacher is a beautiful anime about love and life. Its visuals are probably not the best but the story and concept will grasp your heart tightly if you are a big fan of Senseis. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve lost too many times watching this show. Too many times. I kept losing it. Losing and losing. I kept losing that it just doesn&#039;t matter how many times I lost anymore. <br />
<br />
The story is great until about half-way through the series where the drama slides in. Honestly it was both unpleasant and satisfactory at the same time. This is a romance after all. You wouldn&#039;t expect there to be no

          <span style="display: none;" id="review342265">
        drama at all. After all the drama everything just pretty much felt like a &quot;meh&#039;&quot; until the end. <br />
<br />
The main reason why I gave this anime a 10/10 is not because of the story nor the art but the characters themselves. It is nearly impossible to find an anime where a student has a relationship with a teacher. Nearly impossible. In fact, I think that this is the only anime where it fully focuses on a teacher-student relationship hence its awesome.<br />
<br />
As I said before, I&#039;ve lost too many times watching this therefore it is 10/10. Don&#039;t @ me. <br />
<br />
And yes this review is terrible. Sorry not sorry.

    What you first think about this anime is &quot;another alien to human relationship,&quot; but it doesn&#039;t stop there. I won&#039;t spoil anything though.<br />
The comedy in here is awesome, with very awkward situations and even funnier jokes (Especially when Mizuho&#039;s mother and sister return, funny stuff!).<br />
<br />
I give this a 10/10 because it packs a good dramatic/romantic punch in a short amount of time, with very sad moments.<br />
<br />
No really, (I say this a lot, but I mean it every time) prepare to have your heart strings tugged out!

    I saw &quot; Ano Natsu de Matteru&quot; long before watching this anime, and noticed how there were a lot of similarities. Then after searching online, found out they where made by the same person. <br />
<br />
An alien comes to Earth for surveilence. A human, Kei, sees her land and is immediately involved with her. Next day at school, she shows up in Kei&#039;s class as their new teacher. Eventually, after the usual antics, they end up getting locked in a storage closet and talking about the previous night. Kei agrees to keep her secret, and BAM!! The school principal shows up and is questioning them. Cause,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review188905">
        a teacher and student being locked in a closet together is indecent. That&#039;s when Kei steps up to the plate, and says that they are actually married. <br />
<br />
Later, we also find out that Kei has a very special, incurable condition. When Anxious or nervous, his body will shut down and &quot;stand still&quot; He is still very much alive, but asleep/unconscious until he wakes again. The thing is, Kei could be at a stand still for a few hours or maybe even a few days. I don&#039;t want to spoil the truth about Kei; this is all I can say.<br />
<br />
Watch if you want to see their story unfold. It&#039;s truly a beautiful story, and if you enjoy this, PLEASE go watch &quot;Ano Natsu de Matteru&quot;<br />
<br />
PS -  If you like Taiga in &quot;Toradora&quot; you&#039;ll be happy to see a version of her in both of these animes. Same person, same voice actress for these two animes, which supports these two animes being linked (Ano Natsu &amp; Onegai Teacher)

    Onegai Teacher (a.k.a. Please Teacher) is one of thoose romantic/comedy series that involve student/teacher relationships. It&#039;s also one of those that involve a 3-triangle relationship. I personallly thought that it was hilarious, though in some parts was kinda hectic.<br />
<br />
The story was very well plotted, In most animes, the couple always started hating each other then falling in love but this anime was different. The couple got together pretty early and their relationship developed from there. This anime was one of the more peaceful ones, there isn&#039;t any violence at all (that i remember). I didn&#039;t really like the problem that Kei had (stand-still). Almost every

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23043">
        single episode hada something to do with the &quot;standstill&quot; which sometimes annoys me.I loved the hilarious scenes that were put into it, it always made me laugh.<br />
<br />
The art was very well illustrated. I really liked the drawing for Mizuho (teacher). I just  loved the faces that character show in certain situations. Although there were a few, rare ecchi moments which makes it perfectly fine because it only has 12 episodes and 1 OVA. <br />
<br />
The sound was ok, not too shabby, but not very well done though either. However, I really loved the opening song &quot;Shooting Stars&quot;.  I did like the emotion that the voice actors put into it though, but sometimes i think they were a bit over the line.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#039;t fast paced, or slow, i thought it was moving at a reasonable place, not like other animes that drag on for a very long itme. Sometimes i think some scenes were easy to predict, there sometimes wasn&#039;t much of a suprise.<br />
<br />
Overall I really liked it and i think it would be suitable for almost everyone<br />

    This is one of those shows that you will stumble across and probably not think too much of based off of the show summary, I am here to say that it actually pretty decent. <br />
Please Teacher is a romantically driven show so unless you enjoy that you probable wont get alot out of it. It is the brand of romance that sets this apart from other shows, in that it is between a teacher and student. Then they kick it up a notch(or seven) by making the teacher an alien, so yeah talk about impossibilites. The romance is actually quite deep and satisfying, even if

          <span style="display: none;" id="review84699">
        at times almost childish, and it eventually spreads from two people to almost the entire cast. <br />
This is also a very humorous show, the dynamic characters and situational irony work perfectly together to form a wonderful brand of comedy. The story also has an interesting side story following kei&#039;s mystery ailment, which leads to some drama later on and the shows big twist at the end.<br />
The one issue I had with this is that kei looks like a 12 year old, and in the eng dubbed version even sounds like it; meanwhile of the flipside mizuho looks too old for him and once again, in the eng dub sounds to old for him. My way around this is actually to just watch the subbed version with japanese voices.<br />
Also, the ova episode for this show absolutely made my week when I saw it, if for nothing else than the easy feel it had, and of course the remark about a &quot;different type of cellphone&quot;<br />
Honestly I think that this is a great show even if I did come across it by accident, it just kinda grew on me. <br />
p.s.  I wont say how exactly I accidentally came across it... it is rather humiliating ;)

    Please teacher is an anime every man will fantasize about it. I had watched some of the episodes in Animax long ago, and wanted to watch it because of its art and ecchi scenes. But, recently, when I watched the whole anime I was surprised! It is not all about ecchi, breasts, busty females, but a great story and much more than you expect. I am reviewing Please Teacher having a english subbed version, so, I don&#039;t know about english dubbed version. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
In one line: a forbidden love story. Love between an alien who is beautiful, has perfect body, nice hair, is a teacher and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review191006">
        a weak, high school boy who has low grades. They forced to marry and then they fall in love with each other. There are many twist, comedy, sadness in their relationship, and being the female protagonist the teacher of the male protagonist&#039;s school, the story gets both funny and complicated. They have to hid this fact from the rest of the world that they are husband-wife. the male lead, Kei has a disease called &#039;standstill&#039; which plays a big role in this anime specially at the end. the first part is mainly comedic but second part is very very serious but still has a happy ending. There are another student teacher love story which is completely reveled in the special episode of Please Teacher. I should not tell much more about the story otherwise it will be spoiled. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Art in Please Teacher is outstanding. The characters are beautifully drawn, you will fall love with the animation. Each and every female here is very beautiful, male characters are mainly typical &#039;good boy&#039; type. Specially Mizuho(female lead), Konoha (Kei&#039;s aunt), Koishi (Kei&#039;s classmate) and Hatsuho (Mizuho&#039;s mother) are very beautiful, perfect breasts, beautiful hair, perfect body that all men fantasize. The kissing scenes, ecchi scenes are just great. The background is drawn very nicely. Its almost 13 years passed after this anime was released but it can compete with any new animes in the art department. Still Mizuho is a unbelievably popular as a MILF character.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Very very good, Japanese dub is the best according to me, if you are watching the english dub, then I can&#039;t guarantee that you will find it good. Voice acting is superb and the background music is romantic still calm, one of the best I ever heard. Opening and ending songs are very charming and melodic. The soundtrack is sometimes the main factor watching the anime, apart from art.<br />
<br />
Character: <br />
Good but not so unique, basic romance anime characters. But it fits perfectly to the whole environment.  The feelings development between Kei and Mizuho is the basis of Please Teacher. Their argue over small things, their need for each other made the anime memorable. While other side characters have importance too. This is one of the very few animes having no filler character. Each and every character has its own magnitude. One thing should be mentioned that, most people finds the Kei character is so lame. I don&#039;t think so, because you have to remember that he may be a 18 year old boy but his mental age is 15 due to the standstill disease. In the special episode somehow I felt that Kei is much more matured.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
If you are a only rom/com fan then you will be disappointed. The second part is very very serious almost without any comedy (episode 9-12) having a death which occurred at past. Personally I have enjoyed very much, finished this anime in one and a half day. We all have a crush on one of the teacher in school, we all want him/her to be our soulmate. In this anime your fantasy comes to true. <br />
<br />
Overall: <br />
An outstanding anime. Full of ecchiness, beautiful women, lovely storyline, comedy, sad moments, sweet ending. Please Teacher is the first preference regarding student teacher relationship in the whole anime world. I wish we had some more Kei Mizuho love making scene. It is hard to find gorgeous women like Mizuho and Hatsuho in animes. The end may feel rushed, but I highly recommend Please Teacher. You will melt with the sweetness of Please Teacher.

it&#039;s about a lil spaz that has no life.one day he sees a alien and that alien just so happens to be his teacher. so they marry and move in with each other. are you confused? so was i. it&#039;s truly unremarkable in almost every way. now this anime is by no means bad. it just has nothing good to speak of. <br />
<br />
the good: i can&#039;t say there was a good. the music was o.k and the artwork was not bad.<br />
<br />
the bad: the characters. ahhh, my god they were

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10687">
        so boring!!! i don&#039;t care about any of them. the only thing that could make the main character or any of the characters for that matter, interesting is if the little po-dunk town they all live in was hit by a H-bomb... no i still wouldn&#039;t care. <br />
<br />
verdict: this anime while a waste of space is not to BAD to watch. just to BORING FOR ME to watch. it moves to slow. that the big twist of the teacher marrying the student was done poorly ( mostly because the main character is a pussy and a spaz and is just a lame) so if you have some time to burn and are not looking for something GOOD to watch then this is decent i guess. just don&#039;t look to be wow&#039;ed it.<br />
<br />
this is a 4 of 10

    I love this anime that because of the romance about the boy and the teacher. <br />
The Story:<br />
            A boy named Kei Kusunagi is the main character who suffer from a rare disease, which causes a comatose state referred to as a standstill whenever he is under severe emotional distress.<br />
<br />
           When Kei was only fifteen years old, he had witnessed the suiside of his elder sister, leaving him comatose for three years. Upon recovery,he moved to his uncle to start a new life, and to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14898">
        avoid having difficulties in socializing after in keeping a close relationship with his current friends who are quite understanding, a Galactic Federation starship had entered Earth&#039;s atmosphere; thus, begins the story with Kei, after suffering a minor standstill whilein the vicinity of the lake (where the starship had landed), and then watching as a beautiful half-human alien named Mizuho Kazami materializes beside the shore.<br />
<br />
           Apparently, Kazami was sent to observe their planet. Now, if only Kei could control his feelings for this girl, then things wouldn&#039;t be so complicated.

    I was 14 years old when I really started getting into anime. I was so young and new to the anime world at the time that everything was new. At that time, every type of anime character was unique and refreshing. Obviously that stance changed over the years when I started picking up patterns in the anime genre. However at that time I do remember watching Onegai Teacher, and I remember liking the show. Not good enough to make any top ten list, but nonetheless good enough to remember. 5 years later, I decide, on a whim I might add, to reboot and watch the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review68981">
        show again. Why? I don’t know. It was a simple whim to watch this show that I hadn’t touched in years, and I am glad I did pick it up again. Upon watching this show for the second time, the show blew me away. It was an amazing watch and totally over-exceeded any expectation that I had coming in.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
You can find out about the details for the story by reading the synopsis, but at first glance this seems like your typical comedy, heavy echii type of show. And if that’s not enough to either attract or deter you, there is also the notion of teacher-student love, which a taboo in today’s society.  However, the story doesn’t focus on these aspects at all. The teacher-student taboo isn’t even mention in the anime, and though there are funny moments, the show doesn’t rely on comedy to reel you in. The echii is very low (compared to shows in the genre nowadays), and to me that was refreshing.<br />
	The plot is gradual, with only 12 episodes to tell the story, the pace was very good. The ending was very satisfying, I didn’t have any questions left unanswered (not that I had too many questions in the first place. Overall, I give the story a 10 because I have no complaints.<br />
Art:<br />
It was pretty good, especially considering that the show was made in 2002. The animation was very fluid. The character design was realistic and not over the top. I have nothing to complain about in that category.<br />
Sound:<br />
To me personally, what separates a great show from a masterpiece is the music, the background music. To me, this is what takes a show to another level. Music is able to set a mood more than anything, it can change the mood as well, and when used incorrectly, it can ruin a mood. I take great pride in being able to recognize how well BGM plays in any particular show. In Onegai Teacher, the sound and music was perfect. It was used very well; it set the mood, changed the mood, and intensified the mood. I downloaded the soundtrack very soon after watching the show. 10/10 for the sound for me.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Now, a lot of other reviewers might not agree with me, but I loved the characters. I am a little biased however. Mizuho, the teacher, happens to have the same personality as my girlfriend so obviously I didn’t hate Mizuho. I like most of the things she did and said, she was well drawn, and was a good character. The only thing about her that I would call a flaw is that she was immature and overemotional at times, but come on, every real person has flaws so why wouldn’t a realistic person have some too. Kei, the main protoganist, is a pale geeky looking boy, but surprisingly doesn’t act too geeky or shy. When he needs to speak up, he does. He isn’t scared to argue with or against Mizuho, and he has some sense. He is a very realistic character, someone you would meet in your class or whatnot.<br />
	The other cast members are okay. They fit every typical anime-character stereotypes, but they do bring some things here and there to the show. Overall, the cast is nothing to praise about, but nothing to really critique about either.<br />
Overall:<br />
When I rate a show, I usually rate it based on how it moved emotionally. Did the show make me relate with the characters? Did the mood that the show try to set move me at all? Was the comedy actually funny?<br />
I am not a professional critique, I don’t rate shows based on expectations and minute details. I based it on what is meant to me personally. Onegai Teacher moved me, after watching it a second time, I can say that the show is up there in my top 10 for sure. I love everything about it, and I will definitely watch it a third time soon. 10/10 Overall for giving me a good watch.<br />
