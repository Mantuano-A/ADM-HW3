    I don&#039;t recommend this anime.  Things included in this show are unlikable characters, terrible comedy, and essentially everything you&#039;ve already seen before.  I get it, the chibi form of the main character is cute and marketable, it&#039;s being used on banners and logos and whatnot, but it&#039;s all just a ruse.<br />
<br />
Now let me make this clear.  I love slice of life anime.  I loved Nichijou, Barakamon and the list goes on.  However this particular anime has a few breaking flaws.  First off, the main character is a bratty teenager who basically gets whatever she wants and if she doesn&#039;t,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review202015">
        she throws a tantrum.  Do you even understand how much I wanted to stick my hand into the screen and bitch slap the ever-living shit out of this cheeto lookin&#039; ass?  You know when you go out, there&#039;s always that one kid who just screams and throws a tantrum because they&#039;re spoiled to hell and their parents don&#039;t do shit so you&#039;re stuck with this terrible annoyance that you can&#039;t do anything about?  This anime is basically that.  Twelve whole episodes of that.  The characters are just not likable and the comedy doesn&#039;t vary.  It&#039;s the same shit throughout the whole series.  The main character puts on an angelic front when she&#039;s out in public and everyone loves her, then she comes home and turns into an orange potato and does whatever the hell she wants and whines when she doesn&#039;t get her way.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s the whole anime.  Not even kidding.  I mean sure, let&#039;s bring in another character in different episodes, but it&#039;s the same exact thing that happens every time.  This isn&#039;t even a &quot;this annoying character starts off as someone you hate but gradually becomes someone you love&quot; type deal.  She stays an annoying brat throughout the whole series.<br />
<br />
I am genuinely boggled that this is rated as high as it is.  I can get behind anime with the pure intention of comedy like Gintama, Baka Test etc. but this does it so terribly that it&#039;s not even funny, literally.

    I’m not going to lie. Watching Himouto! Umaru-chan (My Two-Faced Little Sister) makes me feel like a kid all over again. Each week, each episode is like an indoor and outdoor adventure of its own. Titular character Umaru Doma is the class superstar as well as the model that almost everyone looks up to. Her brother, Taihei Doma, is kind of like the sidekick providing her shelter, food, and a sense of comfort for her when she’s living at home. Really though, this series took me by surprise like an unexpected storm. And I’m talking about the type of otaku storm where you have to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199344">
        see it to believe it.<br />
<br />
Based on the 4-koma of the same name, the series is adapted by studio Doga Kobo. In recent years, they are better known for their work with slice of life stories. Essentially, that’s how this show is like. The first episode easily establishes Umaru’s ulterior character. She literally lives a double life. At school, she acts mature, friendly, and in general someone that people idolizes. At home, she is almost the complete opposite with a lazy lifestyle, obsessive otaku personality, and acts like a NEET. This makes the show a bit odd at first seeing how each episode reflects on her double life style. What the series does well on this perspective is to demonstrate genuine comedy. The show makes fun of the otaku culture by saturating it with an immense amount of parody. Umaru’s character is someone that people would least expect to be an otaku from the outside. Yet, the show satires that with her lifestyle at home. In retrospect, the show delivers what I would call a cultural comedy.<br />
<br />
The series also consists of other characters ranging from Umaru’s shy childhood friend Ebina, self-proclaimed rival Sylphynford, and the bizarre and frightening girl, Kirie Motoba. Each of them has a different personality that makes them stand out on their own. Their interactions with Umaru usually brings out the honesty of their characters. Furthermore, each episode provides a better insight about Umaru as well. We learn more about Umaru from both sides of her lifestyle. And through that, the show can make us feel attached to the characters. Umaru’s relationship with her brother can also be quite entertaining to watch. Her brother is the average type of guy with an average job and working an average salary. Umaru often makes him run errands for her although she sometimes gets scolded. Their relationship is the typical brother and sister type with no absurdity involving incest or abuse. As lighthearted as it can be though, the chemistry between some characters can be a bit dull. While most times, the on-screen chemistry has an attachable feel, the concepts are usually recycled tropes. Umaru’s otaku lifestyle can also be a bit odd to get used to considering that it’s so different compared to the outer image she created at school. Selfish and lazy. Those are not good attributes for a young girl like her. But even so, the show satires her personality and connects them with her lifestyle without over exaggeration.<br />
<br />
Despite the series focuses on a more episodic basis, there are a few reoccurring elements throughout the story. Umaru’s double life is obviously one of them but also some of the competition she faces. This includes her love of video games and she later on creates a third personality specifically used to face her rival Sylphynford. Kirie’s relationship with Umaru also brings an interesting idea to the show. “Will someone at school eventually discover Umaru’s true identity and personality?” The show almost made this slip apart in the early stages and often or not, it keeps the audience at their seat of wondering that question. Finally, while there’s no actual dramatic romance in the show, we do get a bit of the puppy love with Ebina. Like I mentioned before, the main supporting characters consists of different personalities and roles to make this series colorful and diverse. <br />
<br />
In essence, the artwork is simplistic yet effective. Umaru’s outer image is crafted with an appealing appearance with her perfectly rounded face, smile, colorful hair, and even body structure as shown in pool class. However, the more entertaining aspect comes with her deformed character. When at home, her character design is that of a kid wearing a hamster shaped hoodie. Furthermore, her behavior and reactions are often like a spoiled brat. The visual style and reactive expressions makes us believe who she is as the two-faced little sister. On the contrary, her brother looks average all throughout the series. And while there’s no explicit fan service in the series, Ebina’s character is designed ways that can raise some eyebrows. All that aside, the artwork is well done in terms of overall coverage.<br />
<br />
The show’s soundtrack is not to be underestimated. Although it lacks any sort of distinctive OST, the way comedic scenes are done is often convincing thanks to the matching soundtrack. Similarly, conversations and dialogues performed by the characters makes you curious about what they will say next often. This is especially true for Umaru as she leads a double life. And from her performance, Umaru’s VA Ami Tanaka deserves a bit of praise for portraying a character with completely different personalities. Other noticeable voices includes Kirie with her intimidating tone or Sylphynford’s pride. The OP and ED theme songs are also creatively done. In particular, the OP song fuses the double life imagery of Umaru.<br />
<br />
Although Himouto! Umaru-chan runs the risk of being a big joke, it ultimately has enough comedy and convincingly gets the audience to laugh. There’s enough jokes in the series that makes it look like satire and in general makes fun of the otaku culture thanks to Umaru. It also has enough time to not forget about the other characters. Furthermore, Umaru’s daily adventures will often get the audience curious to see what she is capable of doing next. As a series that stars a peculiar girl with two-faces, this is more than just a show about a brother and sister.

    This is the anime you probably see all over Tumblr with funny and relatable screencaps. You&#039;d think &quot;Wow, this anime must be really funny!&quot;. Well, it is; In the first three episodes at least.<br />
<br />
Basically, Umaru is a high school student who&#039;s admired by everyone because of her kind personality, looks, and brains. But once she&#039;s at home, she&#039;s a lazy weeb who bosses her brother around 25/8 to do shit for her. The art is decent, I guess, but the main point is suppose to be Umaru&#039;s personality, or at least I think it is.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s some side characters, but they don&#039;t do much. The anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204239">
        has 0 plot. The entire series is just the same repetitive scenes and jokes. Umaru doesn&#039;t improve as a person, even though there were multiple occurrences where the plot could&#039;ve developed, but nothing. Although the episode where she gets to be with her mother for Christmas was really touching, it was the only time that there was some kind of emotional factor in the series.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I watched this anime in hope that I could just relax and laugh, but after episode 5 it got pretty boring, and it was just generic scenes of Umaru being spoiled and playing video games. People hype this anime way too much. It had so much potential, but nothing happens.

    Here&#039;s my thoughts on the show summarized in one sentence:<br />
<br />
Himouto brings a fun style of comedy to the viewer for the first few episodes, and then recycles those same jokes over and over until you&#039;re sick of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the more technical side of things:<br />
<br />
Story- Umaru is a practically perfect girl while with her friends, but a little lazy weeaboo shit when at home with her brother. You&#039;d think I was oversimplifying it, but I&#039;m really not. The plot is rather stagnant and doesn&#039;t change much throughout the show (this isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing)<br />
<br />
Art-<br />
So average that it&#039;s bad. Let me expound on that sentence:

          <span style="display: none;" id="review197719">
        Most shows with an &quot;average&quot; artstyle usually have 1 especially notable thing about the art. With Himouto, you could say that this would be her childlike form, but that&#039;s  really just taken from other shows too. <br />
<br />
Sound- Decent soundtrack and OP. Nice to listen to.<br />
<br />
Characters- They all seem interesting at first, but then lose said interest when you realize how linear they are. They do their role okay though, so can&#039;t say it&#039;s the worst I&#039;ve seen.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- Show is very entertaining for the first couple episodes, then becomes stagnant. Not sure what to tell you on this one.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OVERALL- Himouto does a decent job as a comedy, and if you don&#039;t mind jokes seeming a bit similar to ones previously used, give it a shot. Can&#039;t give this show too high of a rating because simply getting rid of your boredom for an hour or two just won&#039;t suffice.

    A very peculiar creature is living among us, elusive for so many years due to its ability to perfectly imitate a human being. First discovered by SankakuHead in 2013, but his findings are in a language known only to few, but thanks to the hard work of cryptologists at Dogakobo they have provided us with SankakuHead&#039;s findings in a format we can make sense of and I am writing this report after going through their findings.<br />
<br />
Though without a botanical name as yet, but persons around it refer to the creature as &#039;Umaru&#039;, so we shall refer to it as such within the course of this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199395">
        report.<br />
<br />
At first glance the Umaru seems to be a casual and playful creature, it is largely lethargic in nature and enjoys to indulge itself in as much frivolities as it can. Its preferred natural habitat is a suburban apartment with dimmed lightning at low temperatures, it spends most of its time consuming human entertainment such as Television, Video games and the Internet, its main diet though mostly consists of barbecued foods and chilled drinks, however we have witnessed it consuming fruits and vegetables but it shows a strong adverseness to it and only consumes it when forced or as a last resort when starvation kicks in. The Umaru is capable of becoming dangerous however when not allowed its usual diet, environment or entertainment, throwing tantrums and wailing at most occasions.<br />
<br />
The most interesting thing about the Umaru though is its ability to camouflage so perfectly whenever it leaves its habitat and ventures into human society, we have no idea how its capable of doing this but when it does it takes on the form of the perfect human being; smart, beautiful and quite flawless in every aspect of its activities. This has led it to be awed and adored by most in society but heads will surely be turned if and whenever its nature in its own habitat is exposed to them.<br />
<br />
Despite its somewhat selfish and secluded lifestyle it still has a couple of close human companions which it interacts with. It has a blood brother which it lives with by the name of Taihei, but as far as we can tell from investigation he seems to be human, but being a blood relative of the Umaru that section of the investigation is marked as inconclusive at this point. Taihei does most of the housework due to the Umaru&#039;s lethargic nature, he is well aware of all its  characteristics but expresses no serious alarm about it, he does constantly try to lecture and reform the Umaru to the right way but at this point to no success. They express a fondness and affection for each other as siblings, but her usual anecdotes are a constant nuisance to him and we on the investigation team found their interactions amusing and a times heart warming to see.<br />
<br />
Dogakobo&#039;s interpretation of the Umaru and its surroundings is very lovely to look at indeed, though simplistic and not in too much detail it still carries a nice mix of color tones that is very lovely to look at. There are no overly excessive motions but constant motion even in small bouts is present to always make sure things never seem dull.<br />
<br />
In conclusion there is still much we don&#039;t know about this creature and its environment, but from the little that we have seen here it is apparent that it is a charming, playful and a times boisterous, and its many antics and characteristics have often left us laughing or at least left us with a smile on our face and we&#039;re sure will be pleasing to many.

    This anime went from being horrible to somewhat decent to horrible again.<br />
<br />
This is my first review and I plan to write more in the future, so I hope I can explain well why I hate this show so damn much.<br />
<br />
First things first: The story.<br />
There is none.<br />
Umaru, while being popular at school and great in every subject, just turns into a lazy otaku at home, doing nothing but gaming, watching anime, reading Manga and having her older brother she lives with do even the smallest things for her. <br />
That&#039;s it.<br />
There is no plot progression - aside from some season-related episodes - there is no character development,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200150">
        which would be rather necessary to get something out of the main character.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it&#039;s just a comedy&quot;, you might say, &quot;It only has to be fun, what do you expect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course giving a show that bad a score only based on the fact that it has little to no story wouldn&#039;t be fair. Instead, I should focus on the humor, it&#039;s a comedy after all.<br />
And the humor the show has... is so, so terrible. It always happens at the expense of the wrong characters, and the most unlikeable characters end up coming out on top - I can&#039;t find the humor in that.<br />
I will admit that there were a few moments that felt kinda genuine, but whenever the show tried to have emotional moments otherwise, it got immediately ruined afterwards for the sake of some bad and predictable joke. [1/10]<br />
This is, naturally, directly tied to the cast of the show, which has to be one of the most unlikeable casts I have ever seen in a comedy.<br />
Umaru is manipulative and lazy, almost sociopathic in the way she treats her older brother and there is no motivation for her to change her manners completely when she goes outside. She doesn&#039;t work as a character, because her &quot;outside&quot; and true personality don&#039;t fit together at all. There is no way someone could live like that - only hanging around at home, eating snacks and playing games, but still being perfectly healthy, slim, fantastic at sports and great at school without learning or training or doing anything at all. Also she has some kind of chibi form whenever she&#039;s in lazy mode and despite only having other clothing, no one aside from her brother ever recognizes her.<br />
Her Brother Taihei, while being pushed around constantly, tries to change his sister for the better, but always ends up cleaning after her, buying stuff for her and feeling bad because he gets fed up with her more than one time. He goes to work yet still manages the household all on his own, and he&#039;s so much into his adorable little sister it gets annoying really fast.<br />
Ebina, Umaru&#039;s friend, has even less personality than that, she likes to hang out with Umaru, is shy, dumb, in love with Taihei and has big boobs.<br />
Kirie, another friend, is also shy, but really violent with her older brother.<br />
But it&#039;s absolutely okay, because her brother, who is a friend of Taihei&#039;s, is perverted and stupid. Nothing is wrong with girls constantly hitting guys for whatever reason, right? Isn&#039;t it just fun?<br />
Then there&#039;s Sylphyn, who&#039;s competitive with Umaru, a foreigner who speaks very politely and always a bit hyper.<br />
<br />
And I&#039;m supposed to find all of this funny somehow? I can&#039;t. <br />
A character-based comedy is supposed to get the fun out of character interactions, reactions and the situations they find themselves in, but when the whole cast is either bland or horribly unlikeable, the humor doesn&#039;t work.[1/10]<br />
<br />
As for art and animation, they are okay, but not great.<br />
The anime shines with really nice colors and some good, but mostly bland character designs. [5/10]<br />
The sound is also mixed. The show has a rather catchy opening, forgettable ending and boring, bland insert music.<br />
The only thing remarkable here is Umaru&#039;s Seiyuu. In my opinion, she does a great job in trying to give anything likeable to her role and I hope she gets parts in much better Anime in the future. [5/10]<br />
<br />
As for my overall enjoyment... the show had some nice, relaxing parts in it, which is why I kept watching until the end, but after episode 12, I wondered why I bothered at all. [4/10]<br />
<br />
Total score (NOT calculated mathematically): 1/10<br />
<br />
So there you have it. What could have been a nice comedy focused on otaku culture turned into some really unlikeable characters I don&#039;t care about having fun. And also created one of my most hated anime characters of all time.<br />
Hopefully at least Umaru&#039;s Seiyuu will benefit from having been a part of this.

    If my sister acted the way the main character does in this show I think I&#039;d take her round the back and shoot her.<br />
<br />
Wow, that was quite the dark opening, wasn&#039;t it? Let&#039;s...Let&#039;s try that again (cough cough).<br />
<br />
This show makes me want to find the nearest kitchen utensil and then locate the nearest plug socket so that I will never have to look at this orange football ever again...(that&#039;s better!)<br />
<br />
If you can&#039;t yet tell from my terrible jokes I really do not like this show. What started off a harmless comedy with some fun little jokes stays as such throughout the entire show with no

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236963">
        character growth while repeating the same gag over and over again. When this anime was airing last year there was no escaping the orange tic-tac since she was used for every single reaction image and post on every website forum. She was everywhere and unfortunately is still around now. Every Comic-Con I go to, not only am I surrounded by about twenty overweight Narutos, seventy-two Rems and six-hundred Deadpools but also about a million Umarus. As far as the eye can see, all I witness is a shitty waifu. Even in my porn this annoying sister is beginning to show up...and that creeps me out.<br />
<br />
The plot of this anime is pretty paper thin and the crust of each scenario and joke is centred around the little sister character being an absolute cunt to her big brother. Teaching kids everywhere that it&#039;s fine to throw a tantrum and cry if you don&#039;t get your own way just to get your pussy of an older brother to go buy you some potato chips and some cola. Rinse and repeat every episode. Umaru, as a character, is both selfish and annoying in her lifestyle. She has two sides to her life; one in which she is a model student at her school and one in which she shrinks down and becomes the useless slob that she is at heart. While this can provide some comedy for the show most of the comedy is derivative of Umaru crying to get her own way or simply watching her play games and eating food. <br />
<br />
Umaru&#039;s main problem is that she doesn&#039;t grow as a character in the slightest. She stays exactly the same throughout the show and the fact that the show hints at her realising that she is a little too selfish is a kick in the balls to the audience as they never do anything with it and she devolves back into the cunt that she is. Many little sisters of this nature have the same problems in anime. Take for example Kirino from the anime &#039;my little sister can&#039;t possibly be this much of a cunt&#039;. She too is a selfish prick and never changes in her narrative but to be fair, Umaru is not as much of a bitch as she is...she is just annoying. Umaru, in a way, glorifies the lazy and self-entitled lifestyle that some kids are living today. You can call me cynical, and perhaps I am for thinking about this show in this nature but the entire show comes across that being a worthless member of society is okay as long as you can get someone to buy you stuff while you remain a selfish asshole.<br />
<br />
The older brother is a character whom I want to reach through the computer screen and slap. As someone who has three little sisters myself, one of which is about the same age as Umaru herself I feel embarrassed by how much of a pussy he is. He never actually stands up for himself or tries to make Umaru see the error of her ways. He is just there and that&#039;s it. In terms of the supporting cast, they&#039;re a bit more lively and interesting and have more in the way of comedy. I liked Ebina the most...especially her boobs. Yes, it&#039;s shallow but if the show is this shallow, I might as well be too. The comedy is kind of hit or miss for me. While there were some moments that I felt were generally well executed there were plenty in which I couldn&#039;t care for and most of the time the writers constantly repeat jokes throughout the show. The narrative is pretty bare-bones and I&#039;m not expecting anything remarkable out of a slice-of-life show&#039;s story but when the cast is this boring and the comedy is this stale I lose interest fast. The music was okay at best but the wooden train flute got annoying really quickly. The animation and art design was decent and get the job done but is nothing remarkable as a whole.<br />
<br />
Overall Umaru is a show with weak comedy and one of the worst main characters I have ever seen. Umaru was just too much of a dick for me to properly enjoy myself with this show and every time she was on screen I wanted to punch her through the monitor. One may argue that I am taking the show too seriously and that I should enjoy it for what it is. That&#039;s fine, but the show&#039;s comedy is so awful that I find that impossible. If you want to learn how to be the ultimate useless member of society, then watch this show. Awaken the Umaru in you... <br />

    “All I want for Christmas 2015 is Ebina Nana-chan. ^^”<br />
<br />
I first known about Himouto! Umaru-chan after searching what anime I should watch after finishing spring season. Honestly, I consider this as my main priority to watch for Summer 2015, but after watching Gakkou Gurashi! (Considered as my highest priority for SM 2015) I still make Himouto! Umaru chan as my second highest priority to watch in 2015, so no hard feelings for Himouto lovers. :D <br />
<br />
And I’m really glad I watch Himouto Umaru-chan, one of the best combination of comedy and slice of life anime in my life, I don’t know for others but it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199424">
        may depends on their perspectives but for me I totally enjoy it. Down below is my full review about this series. Other than that, I’ve learn so much from this anime that I completely forgotten to do my homeworks. And yet, most of the scenes in this series I can almost relate to my everyday life where my sister is struggling to control me when it comes to anime related staffs. Anyway, back to the review.<br />
<br />
I really like how they scripted the story from the manga, well except some of the scenes may be cut-out but overall it was well adapted and I like how they make the story simple and not too complex, (my perspective). Other than that, the pacing of the story is not too rushed or too slow, just right, (I haven’t read the manga so excuse if I’m wrong). Most of the story focuses on Umaru who has a two-faced side being one a perfect sister with strong intelligence on the outside and seconds after stepping into the house, turning into annoying yet cute otaku Umaru-chan and Taihei whom he has to deal all kinds of problems that his sister cause or make a big tantrum and this is where comedy played a big role in this series. Not much of bikini scenes except for the ED song video and the final episode if you don’t drop the series. Nonetheless, this is a good 2015 summer anime for those who loves comedy and slice of life show. Not much of romance content, but still have those ship moments. Don’t forget, this show has a lot of references from other anime.<br />
<br />
The work is done by Doga Kobo, a studio which make good anime for example Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, Yuru Yuri and recent anime Plastic Memories. Their animations are really decent, not bad for 2015 animations. The background is not too saturated as it follows the mood of the character and character designs are not too bland, in fact Umaru is quite cheerful when she is in cola mode. I love how the original character, Sankakuhead design all the characters of the series, it’s pretty cute especially Ebina. Overall, not much of weird animations made by Doga Kobo.<br />
<br />
Most of the seiyuu which I haven’t heard before are pretty new to the anime industries, yet they did an amazing job voice acting on all the characters in this series, especially the seiyuus of Umaru, Ebina, Kirie and Sylphynford. Not bad for first starters. The OP song is very catchy and perfectly match the personality of Umaru since she loves to play video games so much and the ED song well quite enjoyable to listen. OST or background music are lovely too. And the sound effects when Umaru transforms is almost related to Yuru Yuri’s “Akari disappearance effect” because the director is from Yuru Yuri!<br />
<br />
I love all the characters of this series, they all have unique appearances and personality. I love how Umaru being an otaku at home and loves to talk all about games and anime to his brother because that’s what I did in real life, but I do prefer her on the outside personality though and well the good thing about her is she cares for her onii-chan since he work really hard to financially support her. Sylphynford is Umaru’s not really kinda rival and she loves to challenge umaru just because she is below her but nonetheless they do spent together as TSF and UMR. Kirie, is more like Tomoko from Watamote except that she is cute and shy, well Tomoko is cute too so yeah. She’s having a hard time to talk with other people because of her shy personality but hopefully she would make more friends in the future, well at least Umaru help her. Ebina, ahh my favorite character of the series even though she is just a supporting character. What is so special about Ebina? Boobs? Nope, her air-headness and her kawainess throughout the series, I just wanna pet her head so much. Since she came from Akita, she is trying to improve her standard Japanese language so she can speak without making any Akita dialect, well except if she is in a good mood after tasting Tokyo’s food. Other than that i completely enjoy seeing her in each episodes, makes me happy.<br />
<br />
With most of the episodes has completely finished airing, I feel sad that the show had ended but at the same time, I’m happy that they adapted this from the manga, I would say this is the best 2015 anime summer from my perspective and I enjoyed much watching on this, it helps me to cool down my stress after heavy load of school hours and help to cheer me up when I’m feeling moody. The good thing is that, this has no incest relationship because if it does, well that’s up to your imagination. Overall, this has easily made to be one of the recommendations for anyone who wanted to watch slice of life and comedy for 2015.<br />
<br />
So to sum it all up, it has been an amazing ride with the Umaru and her friends and of course onii-chan throughout the whole series. Also thank you Oota Masahiko for directing Himouto Umaru Chan, he did well on directing this and making it a fun series to watch, he is the director who directs Yuru Yuri S1 and S2, hopefully there would be a season 2 for this, because it was freaking funny and cute to watch. Eventhough it is long and may be completely nonsense but I hope this review is helpful as I went a lot of process of thinking and rewriting the review again for the past few days. Thanks! And have a nice Umaru day!~<br />

    Most of the humour and appeal of Himouto! Umaru-chan comes from the protagonist being strikingly similar to its target audience; a lazy, entitled otaku teenager who always gets what they want. You&#039;re meant to identify with this cola-obsessed girl to the point of empathizing with her every move, and that obviously worked. Within days of the first episode airing, the show became a meme. It was (and at the time of writing, still is) hard to enter an anime discussion without catching a stray gif or picture showing Umaru in her chibi form, because people loved that they saw themselves or their behaviour in this

This isn&#039;t the first time this model has succeeded. In 2013, both Oregairu and WataMote garnished immense popularity by using a character the audience could relate to, through teen angst and depression respectively. And as much as I&#039;d like to lump Himouto! Umaru-chan in with those two, it feels different. It&#039;s not some one-off attempt at being relatable, but a series that wants to tell a story through the eyes of its audience. And I completely hated it until I came to that strange realization. <br />
<br />
While beautiful and endearingly polite on the  outside, the titular Umaru turns to a horrible blob of laziness as soon as she arrives home. She lives with her older brother, Taihei, who thankfully brings no themes of incest to the table. As Taihei&#039;s a strict and punctual businessman, the two don&#039;t exactly get along. All that happens between the two from there on does nothing but highlight Umaru&#039;s much-needed flaws (bad behaviour ahoy), but also makes you feel pretty sorry for her older brother. His patiently putting up with her and loving her regardless is what ends up turning the theme on its head—it&#039;s a critique of the consumer as much as it is a critique of Umaru, even though the characters are too one-note to allow it to work. With all of this trickery going on, the entire premise is much more suited to a drama than the mangaka may realize. Since a better option is available, it becomes pretty disappointing to see the conventional slice of life comedy route being taken every step of the way.  <br />
<br />
Aside from the aforementioned two, the entire cast is fairly unremarkable. You&#039;ve got your shy oppai twintail girl, the energetic rival, and the mysterious tsundere who has a crush on Umaru. Taihei also has two coworkers, who unknowingly happen to be related to two of Umaru&#039;s friends (sigh). Moreover, we don&#039;t get to know very much about these characters beyond their basic stereotypes. Everyone&#039;s certainly able to provide a few laughs along the way, though it always seems like a distraction from the real matter of familial tension. The team behind the anime seems to have a quota to fill for uninteresting or typical scenes, so you never get more than a five-minute glimpse at the better material. It&#039;s a sadistic game, and the way it&#039;s dragged out is extremely frustrating. In the last episode, about four of five prior misunderstandings or lies are perpetuated. Not only does this keep the plot from progressing, but the frustration is furthered when the final scene alludes to the lack of development in Umaru. As I&#039;ve said before, joking about such a serious problem instead of combatting it is a dire mistake. <br />
<br />
Complaints about the literary portion aside, it&#039;s probably the best-looking show of the Summer 2015 season. Dogakobo is clearly proud to prove that you don&#039;t need detailed cuts or any exotic art direction to make something look great, only nice colours and consistently smooth animation. If one thing were to set the mismatched anime aside from its competition, this would be it. Have you not already seen it, I&#039;d advise you to look up the OP for the show. Aside from the catchy nature of the song itself, it&#039;s a fantastic showcase of what I&#039;m talking about. <br />
<br />
So even though I wouldn&#039;t recommend the anime, you can&#039;t exactly go wrong with it. It&#039;s inconsistent in a lot of places and somewhat hard to actually wrap your head around, but you&#039;ll be sure to get a few giggles and a grand treat for the eye. Lest I forget, Sylphynford is a total cutie. If you end up having a little more fun with it than I did, you have my envy.

    Do you want to watch something that will put a smile on your face regardless of what mood you are in? Specifically, an anime that has one particular character that has the charisma and charm to make an entire series into a glorious package of fun and cuteness all by herself? If you do, oh boy, do I have an anime for you.<br />
<br />
Himouto Umaru-chan is one experience that still perplexes me as I am writing this. Not just because of how much I loved it, but also how something like this could exist. It is essentially a gag comedy anime with the most generic formula

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201833">
        you could ever witness if you were reading this idea on paper. An otaku girl who, even though she is an all-star student to her peers on the outside, tries to keep her secret away from the people around her, even her close friends. Only her brother is aware of this since he lives with her and takes care of her despite her wacky and almost nerve-racking antics that drive him almost to the edge of insanity. When you read these two sentences, more often than not, you would most likely shrug off and browse off to the next anime on the anime list. But hear me out for a spare moment of your time.<br />
<br />
I’ll start with the most substantial positive to Himouto Umaru-chan: Umaru-chan. There is no denying her cuteness exists, there’s not. But since I know cuteness is not a character structure that is very clear to many people, I will explain her merits with less vague terms than just being cute. What character merits she has, one, in particular, she manages to show off with high tenacity and spark is charisma. Thanks in no part to how she transitions from your stereotypical perfect girl to a wild chibi character who loves to play games, drink copious amounts of cola, and reading the latest manga issue. After all, who could not relate to a character that exhibits these quirks?<br />
<br />
There are two aspects to this aspect that make it enjoyable: how seamlessly the art style shifts from normal to chibi character design and how the voice actress shifts her voice pitch from this transition. It gives Umaru-chan a great sense of character, not really from a development standard, but an engaging one at that. Her presence in the world demands your attention to her in many ways that could quickly become annoying by the 2nd or 4th episode when poorly done. But to the writer’s credit, they know how to pace off the comedic chibi bits and add in new and exciting subtle ways to make the jokes involving her seem fresh and new with each episode. Even when she is outright selfish and acting like a crybaby, she still comes off as incredibly lovable thanks to the considerable charm that he inhibited from her over-the-top design and personality.<br />
<br />
Another aspect to her that I enjoy immensely is her relationship with her brother, Taihei. You could say it is a relationship, albeit a bit exaggerated, that is both hilarious and somewhat realistic if you’ve ever had an annoying little sister, or brother, who annoyed you. Despite her constant barraging of wants and needs to her big brother, they still form a close relationship of sibling love that is honestly touching in a few episodes where Taihei does good things for her out of the kindness of his heart, and vice versa with Umaru-chan. Her over-the-top personality doesn&#039;t overshadow him as he does carry himself as another funny character in what can be described as the best sibling duo in anime in recent memory.<br />
<br />
Himouto Umaru-chan’s brand of comedy is one other big positive that sets itself higher than most comedies that center around otaku life. For one, it does not overly state that the otaku lifestyle is inherently tremendous or bad at the same time. It mostly keeps the message subtle so that it does not distract us from the comedy bits too much. It has no well-defined message written into the narrative or characters since it knows what type of show it is and runs with it as a silly comedy. This is where the subject matter of being an otaku is seen better than most that try to because it can be enjoyed by everyone who has a particular view on this specific issue that can be against or for it.<br />
<br />
As for the comedy jokes themselves, most of them hit the mark quite well. A lot of it centers around satire of real-life issues that we all go through, whether it is how we go through the internet, social situations, and our need for material goods more than anything else. What’s great about it is that you do not have to be a self-described otaku, or know the culture for the matter, to get the jokes. Such as not getting any internet connection for today and realize how life seems meaningless without it, and so on. The banter with Umaru-chan and her brother is always the biggest highlight in the show’s comedy, as I’ve mentioned before about the great relationship they have. And there are even some funny moments with the supporting cast; unfortunately, they are not on the same comedic level of our two siblings.<br />
<br />
The supporting cast, what little there is that garner a significant role in a specific arc, have their moments here and there. Umaru-chan’s best friend, Ebina, is undoubtedly one note in how she is continuously shy whenever she is near people. Not to say that they are not funny by any stretch, it just does not raise the bar for one of the best shy girls in anime. Sylphinford is pretty hilarious as Umaru-chan’s gaming rival. Kirie Motoba, however, is my least favorite of the cast. It mostly comes down to the fact that whenever she is with any other character, like Umaru-chan, her personality gets overshadowed by how bland it is.<br />
<br />
I want to give an honorable mention to the OP/ED, which I rarely ever do in reviews only if it is something special. To which Umaru-chan’s is quite the special one that always sets the stage for what you are in for. Just from the first ten seconds of the OP always makes me bob my body up and down to the rhythm of the cute repetition of Umaru-chan shouting “Umr hai” over and over makes me giddy with excitement every time. Aimi Tanaka’s performance proves she can be exciting not only with her voice over but also her singing, even if it isn’t the best voice in the business.<br />
<br />
Finding a great otaku comedy is hard to come by. As many as there are, some are good or decent enough to think of it as a good time waster and some are wholly average or below that do not have any punch to their jokes. Himouto Umaru-chan has officially risen my optimism for more comedies of this nature like this one to come out more often. It succeeded in proving to me that this type of comedy is far from dead. I know some may groan at that notion, but if more studios take notes from Himouto Umaru-chan, I’m all for it.<br />
<br />
Grade: A-<br />

     I don&#039;t really recommend it. This show just tries so hard to make a cute anime but kind of backfires and gets an unlikable spoiled mary sue. The main character, Umaru, gets almost everything she wants, I mean EVERYTHING from her brother but I&#039;ve never even spotted her to be thankful.  Compared to her brother and other side characters, the main character, is just too pretty? I guess? And between her brother and her, they&#039;re not even similar as if they aren&#039;t even related. Such a bad design.<br />
 All I can see is that she tries to act cute and gets what she

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339851">
        wants, she gets good grades, has good friends, and at home, she does whatever she wants. Life doesn&#039;t work like that even though it&#039;s just an anime, in my opinion, it was annoying to watch.  I question if she even contains character flaws. They should make characters balanced. <br />
I give this 2/10. I wouldn&#039;t recommend you if you can&#039;t stand a story about the main character with no character development, nor any flaws to begin with.

    By day she is known as the famous perfect girl with princess like qualities: Umaru-sama, but by night she transforms into the fridge raiding, cola drinking, snack munching, and brother mongering girl known as: Umaru-chan. She is the epitome of cute and fun characters; she gives off the kind of aura that makes you want to forgive her for even her biggest grievances. She is adorable, she is malicious, she is conniving, and all the while still manages to be sweet. She is the kind of character who will make you froth at the mouth with anger, and then seconds later offer you her favorite

          <span style="display: none;" id="review202660">
        thing begging for forgiveness. She is heartwarming and reminded me instantly of my time watching Oreimo (How can my little sister be this cute), minus the incest obviously. We are introduced to a girl who when outside is: kind, loving, mature, serious, and someone that others look up to. However as soon as she gets home and puts on her orange hamster cloak she transforms into the annoying yet lovable pest that she truly is, a quality she is only willing to show around her brother. This show is hilarious and a blast, as it should be expected seeing as how it is a comedy.<br />
----Spoiler Free----<br />
Characters: 9<br />
Character Development: 7<br />
This show has a wonderful main character, however she is unfortunately the only character who seems to shine out of all the cast, this show reminds me a lot of Nyarko-san, in that the whole entire show is supported by a single really well fleshed out and lovable character. While the cast as a whole may have great chemistry, and complement each other perfectly (ie. Umaru and her brother) leading to tons of funny and enjoyable moments. It still must be noted that none of the other characters really get developed any further, and at the end of the show they are the exact same person as they were at the start. The same can be said for even the main character Umaru-chan, while she does face her mistakes head on, and seemingly learns from them. The episode will end and i the next episode she&#039;ll do something which basically mirrors what she was scolded for. This lack of growth is a given though, seeing as how all of the comedic elements stem from the duality in her character, and how she only reveals certain characteristics to certain people. That topped with the perversion of her originally perfect image lead to a rather jarring, and because of that funny story.<br />
Plot: 7<br />
Pacing: 8<br />
When you start up a slice of life/ comedy show, you don’t go into it expecting much in terms of plot development, the reasoning behind that is similar to why there isn’t any character development. The comedy aspect of these types of shows often relies on the state that the characters are currently in, in order to create a parody of reality, one that we as humans find to be funny. Going into more detail about that, this show has little to no real advancement in plot and stays in its comfort zone throughout the entire story. The show is divided up into a bunch of little skits, most of which take place in the comforts of their home, wherein Umaru, the main character, is made to reveal what we as an audience are seeking to see, a funny and abnormal character whom we seem to become fond of and attached to. <br />
Art: 8<br />
Music: 8<br />
Once again there isn’t much that can be said about the art. It didn’t serve us up any new kind of controversial art style, nor did it really push its own boundaries. It, like this show, stayed in its comfort zone utilizing a more warm and bubbly feeling animation style. The art was all in all well directed and fitted the tone and mood of the show. As for the music, like the art style, it fit the show well with some nice and quirky music to accompany Umaru’s escapades, and an above average intro song. The background music while not standing out did a nice job creating and maintain the atmosphere of the show.<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
In the end I find that the most important part of a show is whether it is enjoyable or not, and let me tell you, oh is this show enjoyable. I found myself smiling throughout a majority of the show and sympathizing with the characters who I had grown to adore. I considered giving a perfect score in terms of enjoyment however there were times where the comedy went over my head due to culture differences, or times where the sits just plain had nothing of interest to bring to the show. And so it is for those reasons that I award Himouto Umaru-chan with<br />
______________________________________________________________________________<br />
Final Verdict: 80/100<br />
Thank you for reading. Definitely be sure to check out the show if you haven’t seen it already, and I hope you have a nice day.<br />

    I&#039;ve never hated a character more in my life, watching this anime made me want to rip my nails out. If I believed in god before watching this steaming shit pile, this would convince me that God died long ago. I&#039;d rather watch Berserk 2016 and 17 on loop. I literally could not stomach watching the entire anime, it&#039;s not even entertaining with how bad it is, it&#039;s just grating on the soul.<br />
<br />
If this anime was never produced I know that we&#039;d be closer to world peace, but the cosmic fucking disturbance that was created by Umaru crawling out of the deepest pits of hell

          <span style="display: none;" id="review391757">
        is really hampering that.<br />
<br />
Please spare your sanity and never watch this damned show lest you actually go hollow. I legitimately despise this anime with all my being.<br />

    Believe me or not, this anime is not bad at all. Umaru-chan is genuinely a really funny show, something that isn&#039;t as bad as what many people say out there. Now that I&#039;ve made my effort to clear out the random crap, let me properly make my review on this anime.<br />
<br />
Umaru-chan focuses the most on 2 people, Umaru and her brother, Taihei. This brilliant show presents the 2 sided sister paired up with basically one of the best brothers you can ever find in this universe. Umaru, a top over-exceeding student, is a totally different person when she is in her home. She transforms into

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316917">
        the &#039;ultimate life form&#039;, becoming easily the most annoying brat there is in this whole entire world. A total meanie to her brother, is what someone else will say. It looks more like every child when they are with their parents in the toys&#039; store when they were young. When your parent won&#039;t buy the toy that you want so much, and there you go, making a tantrum and start rolling around everywhere. That&#039;s the best thing of this anime, it perfectly shows what it tells you, a perfect 2-sided sister. You can definitely see the contrast of Umaru when she is with her friends and compared to when she is with her brother or is at home.<br />
<br />
The art for this anime is displayed really well. I love how Umaru turns little when she changes &#039;faces&#039;. My theory of this change is that , this is to show how Umaru&#039;s mentality becomes equivalent to a little child. Like what I said earlier, Umaru&#039;s other face feels like a little child with her parents in the toys&#039; store. This makes my passion for this anime grow even further once I theorized that fact. I still wonder why do the hamsters look so oddly strange, that still leaves me thinking for a while. Still haven&#039;t found an answer. <br />
<br />
As for the sound goes, I cannot say anything in terms of voice actors since this is the only anime where I&#039;ve seen most of them voice act a character. Something I can say is that, they&#039;ve done a pretty good job, to annoy so many people like this. Shows that they have really done the job well and right. It&#039;s also pretty awesome how the voice actors are the ones who are singing the opening theme and the ending theme, instead of hiring actual professional singers. I really appreciate that, it might not even as well thought out or perfect as the ones professionals compose and sing. However, the effort they&#039;ve placed into practicing and playing the song is also quite a lot. I truly admire that effort that they have put into making it.<br />
<br />
Umaru herself is a pretty hard character for some people to accept, since according to people, she is considered to be an annoying character. To speak the facts, she was designed this way, to be an annoying, selfish brat that only basically thinks of herself and not others. I respect that Doga Kobo was able to perform that task out pretty well. The tantrum animations were just right on point, I had a pretty good laugh watching this show thanks to this one character. I should also speak more about the other characters while we are at it. Taihei is your generic, nice brother character that is created to get abused by Umaru, but he&#039;s really tolerant, patient and kind. I love his little friendship with Ebina, it&#039;s quite adorable. Ebina should get some more love though, I feel that she is quite an underrated character in the series. Kirie is amazingly played out, I&#039;d place her 2nd to Umaru or actually maybe on par with Umaru. She plays out the shy personality amazingly good, also the rumbling scenes when she gets pissed off is awesome. Sylphin feels like she needs to be expressed more in the series. She is like a rival, but feels off at the same time. It&#039;s either horribly played out or because this is a Slice of Life. Either reason, Sylphin would have become a way better character if she was expressed more as a rival than as a person that looks like some crazy attention seeker you will find in every class you have ever attended.<br />
<br />
I truly enjoyed this anime, however, I do get slightly pissed off when Umaru is a meanie to her brother, but it depends on the situation. After all, this is a show to presenting to you what people think of you when you do these kind of things. The comedy is really well drawn out, I had a few good laughs with this show, can&#039;t tell you which ones though. (watch yourself to find out &gt;.&lt;) <br />
Will I recommend this anime? Well, to keep this straight, I&#039;ll say yes &amp; no. Yes because it honestly give you a sense of all the guilty you have done in the past (devil face). No because some of you will get angry at Umaru for being an annoying brat, but isn&#039;t this what this show is about?! I don&#039;t get humans these days... ;.;

    3 episodes. 3 episodes is all I could muster before I wanted to toss my PC out the window and drink to wipe this shit from my memory.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever wanted to reach through the screen and slap any character before like I wanted to slap her, but that was before I saw that hamster hoodie wearing waste of space known as umaru. What can be said about her besides the fact she&#039;s a horrid creature? Honestly not much. She&#039;s a self centered child who tortures her brother with her constant screeching because she doesn&#039;t get her way like a child throwing a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411916">
        fit over being told the word &quot;no&quot;.<br />
<br />
I had hoped her brother would be somewhat better and not enable the little demon and reward her for throwing a fit like a child after being told no, but alas my wish was not to be. He has no backbone and just gives in to little monster like the bitch enabler he is and continues to reward the little monsters behaviour.<br />
<br />
I have nothing to say about the rest of the cast because frankly i don&#039;t care they&#039;re all bland.<br />
<br />
If you have absolutely nothing else to watch...look again I can promise you&#039;ll find something much more deserving of your time. I just have nothing good i can say about this show. Respect yourself more and find something that is worthy of your time.<br />

  Himouto Umaru-chan is one of my favourite anime, and I have rewatched it 4 times until today.<br />
<br />
  I wouldn&#039;t say that it&#039;s a must or a masterpiece, but the way it is presented is relaxing and enjoyable. Umaru is adorable, pretty, smart and of course an OTAKU. ヽ(o＾▽＾o)ノ<br />
<br />
   The fact that she has all these qualites makes you relate to her, and feel happy and proud about being an otaku, but also motivated to work hard with your studies and friendships.<br />
<br />
   All episodes are funny, because they depict the hardships of the otaku life, who wants

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321125">
        to stay home and watch anime or play games, but also maintain their social life without being fully exposed 	o(&gt;ω&lt;)o<br />
<br />
   I hope this anime give all of you the same enjoyment and warmth that gave to me and made me love it with all my heart	(´｡• ᵕ •｡`) ♡

    Himouto! Umaru-chan is a funny anime, does that you see them just for having a good time and laugh about the things that happens. Very short if you don´t like extended anime. Very interesting the fact that the main character have a split personality. <br />
<br />
Story : 10/10.<br />
Very short story, but funny. A lot of references of things, if you know things from Actual Japanese Culture, you´ll have a lot of fun finding them.<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
Lovely drawing style, the difference from the normal drawing and the chibi is amazing. Characters are cute.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10.<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
Lovely characters. Great develop of the characters, and very interesting the way characters react

Enjoyment: 10/10.<br />
Very funny, to see it in a row it´s highly recommended. Laughs are guaranteed.

    This anime was recommended to me by one of my friends. I&#039;m just gonna point this out now but this is pretty much your average comedy slice of life anime with cliches all over the place. If you&#039;re looking for a great story then this is not for you. Also if you dislike this &#039;&#039; annoying &#039;&#039; imouto type who forces her onii-chan to do everything you&#039;ll seriously hate this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
As i&#039;ve stated before, this doesn&#039;t have a good storyline. It&#039;s pretty much how the main characters spend their days. What i do like is however that they try to hint alot of relation and expose

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199965">
        the main things about the anime. They will try to make you hyped about when her secret will be revealed or trying to create some shipping. There&#039;s even hint of backstory. However this anime will not bother doing any of that since they have to keep the manga running forever, you know.  The loose and unconnected storyline might get you confused however remember that every episode is a singular episode with some connections here and there.<br />
<br />
This is what seperates this anime from others. It&#039;s an extremely calming slice of life without any tension or drama. This is a perfect show to watch if you just wanna laugh and enjoy since it really doesn&#039;t want to create any tensional problem or any development in anything all. This is however great since every comedy anime has some type of conflict. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t comment much on this except that the character design is good however nothing special. However sadly it is below average in terms of animation compared to today (not overall) which does minus point it, however there&#039;s nothing large to notice so do not get put down by thinking it has bad art.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem people has with the art is that they dislike chibi and moe type of character designs which is what this anime excels at. Honestly there&#039;s not really much of loliness here and you shouldn&#039;t be annoyed unless you have a grudge against moe. I personally like moe designs and also like cute female characters which is literally the definition of Umaru so it&#039;s a big plus for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The BGM is very relaxing and sets the mood most of the time. This is a very good point of the anime, but as said there&#039;s absolutely nothing memorable whatsoever in terms of OST. I&#039;ve never said &#039;&#039; yes, the OST finally came up &#039;&#039;. I even forgot it even existed. <br />
<br />
The voice acting is very good in this anime. I really think most of the characters fit their voice actors and they&#039;re also very skilled. I don&#039;t have any complaints here.<br />
<br />
The opening is probably very hated and very loved. I can&#039;t explain it so just try listening to it and you&#039;ll see what i mean. I personally like the opening, although there&#039;s nothing more to it. It&#039;s memorable due to the parodic tone the opening has. The ending song is not bad but i really couldn&#039;t care less about it. The OP/ED however sets me in a somewhat correct mood which is a plus.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Honestly you have this set of typical characters which are likeable. I even did some shippings because they were likeable and the main girl (Umaru) really takes on an interesting social point. Although it might see very common but trying to hide your indoor life from your life with other people is something we&#039;re all mostly doing and can even cost you your real life relationships if you&#039;re too deep. I really like how Umaru is trying to hide her otaku life. This is actually i myself am doing at school with like 99% of the people there. I am not open with ANY non anime watcher at all. My school personality and real life are too different.<br />
<br />
What&#039;s the problem you ask? I did say that the characters are likeable. This by no means mean that they got depth. This also means they hardly got any character development. They remain the exact same as the start. Umaru is probably the one i expected to get developed the most however i was left disappointed. She is still this character who drags around her Onii-chan to do everything. You can somewhat see her opening up to the people around her however she is still kind of the exact same thing.<br />
<br />
Obviously i know the point of this anime but it&#039;s still sad, you know :(.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
This does what it&#039;s meant to. It&#039;s really enjoyable and keeps you to watch it. I do not recommend you binge-watch it after the mid-point (the early point worked well when i binged watched it). It will eventually tire you out and you will give it a lower score than you intented to. The comedy is good but it somewhat repetitive with these overused scenes however i don&#039;t think this will stop you from enjoying it.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
This anime really isn&#039;t anything special and is pretty much a very good relaxing anime with some annoying cliches. This doesn&#039;t have any conflict at all nor does it have much character development at all. It&#039;s really just a fun anime without any cliffhangers which you might enjoy unless you really dislike moe art. What sets this back is this tone of not wanting to continue any department.

    the only difference between watamote and himouto umaru chan is that watamote main character is an ugly piece of shit. himouto umaru chan is the same as watamote the only difference is that umaru chan is attractive. but wait what about the plot dude? the plot is about a brother and sister complex bullshit if i were to have the same sister as umaru i would be completely depressed and have nothing to do in my life other than crying and praying that she grows up someday. umaru does nothing in her life her brother gets her stuff all she does all day eat food

          <span style="display: none;" id="review216103">

    I don&#039;t get how any of this is enjoyable. Umaru&#039;s character is such a brat. You would&#039;ve thought that she would get some character development, but no... she&#039;s just an annoying dweeb for the entire series. I was WAITING for the comedy but I got was actions from a little girl that was supposedly funny? Even the brother was a nuisance, he didn&#039;t actually teach Umaru any lessons and furthermore, let her do what she wants. <br />
*spoiler alert (kinda)*<br />
Something that&#039;s frustrating is that Umaru&#039;s secret didn&#039;t even get out. Are all the characters dumb or something? I would&#039;ve enjoyed the show if: <br />
1. all the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review348429">
        characters&#039; personalities get replaced<br />
2. it was actually funny<br />
3. there were some plot twists<br />
4. it didn&#039;t exist<br />
<br />
Overall, I finished this show expecting it to turn out good near the end, but all I got was nothing. :) 3/10 never again
