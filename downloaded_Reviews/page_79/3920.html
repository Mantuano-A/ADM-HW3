    -FULL FINAL REVIEW-<br />
<br />
It’s been quite a while since Gochiusa, Kiniro Mosaic and Yuru Yuri had aired. We’re quite grateful for Anne Happy, an unhappy anime but very silly, comedic and CGDCT to be adapted. This is one of the 8 SOL to be aired on Spring 2016. There is quite a lot of SOL airing this season.<br />
<br />
Anne Happy to me is quite interesting to watch though there’s not much of people watching it. The core is much formulated, it can play off anime cliché as they use many frills moments to as the comedy theme, not by throwing it unnecessarily. Of course, it has a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222161">
        pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off. <br />
<br />
In addition, Anne Happy adds comedic and gag scenes to keep the show entertaining and interesting as it helps to spies up the viewer’s perception. Anne Happy’s comedic contents are quick and snappy to understand, such as the use of manga panels to deliver the comedy at a quicker pace however the excessive use of it can be a bit hassle.<br />
<br />
By far, the story plotline is not complicated or complex to watch.<br />
<br />
Animation wise, is handled and produced by Silver Link, a great studio which made Non Non Biyori. The animation was pretty decent and manga iconography is used to express the characters feelings. The character design was what made me impressed the most, this is by far from my perspective the best character design I ever seen, not to argue I just seem to like the character design as well as their eye design. The use of color is not too saturated as colors are used lighter to suit the theme, heck even 1080p I can see the difference. I still wonder how they can handle two anime production at the same time, I&#039;ve been noticing that since fall season. In short, though a lot of loading screens are used, the character designs and animation is done pretty well by Silver link.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the OP and the ED songs, as well as the OST. The voice actors for all the characters were pretty decent, I start to notice the VA who voiced Hibari, as she was voiced Kirie in Umaru chan, I was pretty stunned how amusing her voice be, even her singing skills are pretty damn good. An’s VA wasn&#039;t bad, some of her lines were pretty cute especially the “right” line. Botan’s VA on other hand, I get confused who voiced her, she kinda sound like Hayori. Hibiki’s VA is almost too similar to Sharo’s VA from Gochiusa. In short, silver link VA selection is pretty decent though, there aren&#039;t any big VA names.<br />
<br />
Ohh btw, TIMOTHY RAP SONG IS THE BEST!<br />
<br />
Talking about the characters, Hibari-chan stand out to me the most, I love the fact that she is very oblivious to not having any misfortune, despite she has one which is love misfortune nonetheless, she is one of the ordinary type of student without having any mishaps or bad luck occurring on her. Hibari has the mature type of attitude, whom she can concern anyone if they were in trouble especially An. An on the other hand, is a cute character who unfortunately suffer a lot of bad luck, feel pity on her. Botan on other hand, she is most likely used as character gag which make everyone laugh, she is quite prone to getting injuries even the smallest hit. Really not much to talk about the characters from Anne Happy.<br />
<br />
TL;DR In conclusion, Anne Happy is a great anime to watch, even though the excessive moe content is used to much, the content of the story is still there unlike some other which only focuses on fan service and deviating out of the plot which why some people wonder what the story is all about, Anne happy is different. Animations is pretty decent and sounds aren&#039;t pretty bad. There is little structural view as Anne Happy only offer comedies to the viewers.<br />
<br />
To sum it up, Anne Happy can be watched by anyone, but it would be recommended if you have a taste on SOLs, comedy and CGDCT.

    Story: 1/10<br />
The story only fits anime with a schoolgirl theme/setting. Any other anime, it wouldn&#039;t work. So basically, it&#039;s unoriginal.<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
The art was good for the most part. It&#039;s just the right amount of brightness, which is key to a schoolgirl/moe anime and the girls are cute. But the fact that the main characters are the only people with FACES is lazy. I mean, really?? They couldn&#039;t take the time to at least put faces on the other students in the class?? Unbelievable!<br />
Sound: 1/10<br />
Awful and forgettable. I hated the opening and ending songs and the music they use in the episodes just sounds so simple

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221610">
        and retarded.<br />
Character: 1/10<br />
This is 1 of the few anime I&#039;ve seen in which I&#039;ve hated ALL of the main characters and I&#039;ve been watching anime for 5 years. You know an anime is bad when you hate the characters. Hibari is considered the main character, but we get little to no backstory on her! There are hints, but of course, they&#039;re too lazy to go into detail just like with the art. Also, her liking the construction sign is the stupidest thing I&#039;ve ever heard in my life. They basically shove it in our face that Hanako is unlucky. Every episode, something bad happens to her. We get it: she&#039;s unlucky! You don&#039;t have to remind us every single damn episode! Botan was so annoying with her constant injuries, Hibiki is a HORRIBLE tsundere, and Ren is kind of like the female version of a bland shoujo male main character. That&#039;s the #1 problem with this anime: they gave each character 1 or 2 personality traits and made it a running gag in which they showed it in each episode. I get that they&#039;re unlucky, so that&#039;s the main reason why, but they should&#039;ve figured that at some point, it&#039;s going to get repetitive, which will eventually make the anime boring and unejoyable to watch.<br />
Enjoyment: 1/10<br />
I got absolutely no enjoyment out of watching this anime. <br />
Final score: 2/10<br />
They did everything that you&#039;re NOT supposed to do in a schoolgirl/moe anime. Lazy art, annoying characters, and unenjoyable to watch. The story itself is pointless. The teacher gives them assignments to do so they can find happiness and if they fail, they get a punishment. The main characters always fail the assignments or end up in last place, but there&#039;s always a loophole, so the punishment doesn&#039;t end up being that bad. In that case, what&#039;s the point of teaching them happiness if she lets them off the hook all the time?? Don&#039;t watch this anime. It&#039;s bad. Period.

    As I am new to making reviews, please be gentle (might be some spoilers XP)<br />
<br />
Of course, their is another Moe anime in this season, but what caught my eye. The story and plot is which that caught my eye.<br />
<br />
The story is about the five girls who go to school in a class called the Happy Class. This class for the people for the unlucky and the purpose of this class is to become, well happy.  The story is different from what  I have seen from the other SOL anime. The ending was also very satisfying :).<br />
<br />
I felt the art was a good asset

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221627">
        to this. Although, if you are bothered by chibi characters, well there is a lot of them here. I&#039;m not that bothered by them but why did I grade the animation so high in this. Well the animation consists of bright colors in the most important scenes. I felt this animation was really pretty and I was glad to see  sometimes that the characters looked different with different colors. <br />
<br />
The openings to moe animes are usually upbeat or very cute. Now, this anime is different with a funky opening which gives me the feels of happiness. The ending is really good as well, the opening and ending fit this anime really well.<br />
<br />
Now now, the characters did fit in the anime but I guess I wasn&#039;t really  satisfied you could say... there is your average tsundere, kuudere, glasses, derdere and a weird person you could say. I did not hate them though, just a little disappointed  you could say.<br />
<br />
I really did enjoy this anime, seeing a different kind of style to anime is very cool and I think there should be more animes like this. Overall I give this a 7  but the anime is very good anyways. <br />
<br />
This is a good anime if you&#039;re expecting a good kind of moe anime, so just give it a try :D<br />
<br />

    As the title implies, Anne Happy♪ is a bundle of happiness that can bring a smile to anyone.<br />
<br />
The story was something that caught me by surprise since the summaries I read prior to the show&#039;s airing was pretty vague. In this case, the surprise was a good thing because I came to loving it. The show just gets wackier with each episode and that&#039;s what makes it great.<br />
<br />
I believe the show wouldn&#039;t be what it is if it wasn&#039;t for the characters. This series would be considered what the anime community calls &quot;moe blob&quot;, which basically means a show with the most adorable characters. Anne

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221617">
        Happy is definitely one of those. Normally with this type of show, the characters don&#039;t get any major developments and usually stay within their specific personality. However, that&#039;s not much of an issue when it comes to these as you end up liking the character for who they are.<br />
<br />
As I started watching, the first thing right away that caught my attention was the animation. Everything was consistent, from the movement to the character models, but what intrigued me was the look/style to it. There are lots of vibrant colors mixing together making it look like a cover of a coloring book. At one point, I began realizing that it looked similar to the series Baka and Test, which turns out to be the same director.<br />
<br />
There obviously isn&#039;t anything to grand about Anne Happy, but what made me enjoy it was all the lovable characters, the beautiful aesthetic to it, and the over-the-top comedy that ensues. It was so lighthearted that I could not hate it.

    This anime is a 10 because of that op movie, just the cutest thing i&#039;ve seen in years.<br />
<br />
Even if you don&#039;t really think the op movie is that good the anime is hilarous/cute nonetheless, a good enjoyable anime.<br />
<br />
Now, I&#039;ve gotta write a longer review but i don&#039;t know how to, so i&#039;m just gonna say that Hibarigaoka Ruri is my new Waifu (even more than Kuroneko from oreimo).<br />
<br />
Just how long is a review gotta be!? Well, the anime is about unfotunate kawaii girls doing what an unfotunate kawaii girl should do, that is, helping each other when in trouble and being cute (can i submit

    First I want to restate that this is not my got to genre for anime (that being mecha) but I have enjoyed a few school girl comedies (YuruYuri &amp; Love Lab). So when I read the premise for this show I thought I give it shot. It was worth it. It&#039;s funny, cheerful and bright. The characters are adorable because they try so hard despite their individual &quot;conditions&quot; The show can come across as repetitive, but that&#039;s what makes it so fun. You the jokes are coming so it never gets old. The fact that they all know these things befall them yet they go

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221622">
        out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts. My favourite character was Botan because no matter what she was doing you just know she going to get hurt. It&#039;s her running gag. Hanako was just as amusing because she would just find herself in these random life or death scenarios adding constant drama and change. My second favourite was Ren because despite all her good luck she has the misfortune of being friends with Hibiki. Hibiki was kind of annoying at first, but once you realize (like Ren) she just that way it&#039;s okay. Hibiki inevitably gets lost and it never gets old. All the characters are great, let me just sum it up there. I do want to mention how Punch Mind Happiness is an addictive op song. There was nothing about this anime I didn&#039;t like, I can not praise it enough. I hereby nominate it for anime of the year!<br />

    Hello yall! Today, I have decided to make an honest, and special review for one of my absolute favourite anime of all time! It is called Anne-Happy! So, what makes me like it? Well, I am very glad you asked. You see, I love this anime, because it is an absolute masterpiece compared to that of Death Note, Gintama, One Piece, Fairytail ect. Now tell meh, do you like Naruto, Dragon Ball, Pokemon, and mexican pie?? Well this is the anime for you!<br />
<br />
I learned about this anime from a good friend of mine named Jimothy. He walked up to meh one day, and with this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review225370">
        smug-ass look on his face, he said: &quot;Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?! Than watch this freaking anime!&quot; At first, I thought he was high on something, but a few into the conversation, he caught my attention. He said to meh: &quot;You&#039;ll like this anime, because it&#039;s not Naruto, BELIEVE IT!&quot; That made me intrigued, so I began binging this 12 episode work of art.<br />
<br />
So here are our cast of characters! Our main character is Anne, she has terrible luck, and acts like a complete moron, which makes her useless. She is just there, so the weebs have some kawaii fan service. Our next character is, Twilight spar-I mean.... RURI! She is very uninteresting, and worst of all, she is in love with a damn construction billboard! Like, how lonely can you seriously get?! Our next character, is squid girl, aka Botan. She has no calcium in any of her bones, and they brake all the time, only thing is, she apparently, also has the gift of regeneration... or something. Which makes her useless, just like our main hero.... THAN, FINALLY, I thought I had found the absolute best characters, Ren and Hibiki! Who although had the best relationship, and personalities, still had some trashy problems. Hibiki (My personal favourite ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) had a terrible sense of direction! And her best friend Ren, had a serious problem when it came to keepin her damn eyes open. So they become useless like all the others! I tell ya, they are all still better than L, Monkey D. Luffy, Elric Edward ect.<br />
<br />
Now, time for our sponsorship moment! DO YOU LIKE CHEEEESE?! WELL, WE HAVE GOT A FINE SELECTION OF YOUR FAVOURITE QUALITY CHEESE PRODUCTS! WE&#039;VE GOT CHEDDAR! MOSSERELLA! SWISS! AND IF YOU&#039;RE REALLY IN THE MOOD..... PERMISEEEEAAAAN!<br />
<br />
Now that we got that outta the way, let&#039;s continue! The plot is very non exsistent! Like, seriously, the writers get really bored at one point, and decide.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#039;s get some of that SAO in there, and some of dat Sailor Moon, and a bit of Attack on Titan, with a giant fluffy bunny!&quot; And don&#039;t even get me started on how they play tag! I mean, this whole anime revolves around the main characters becoming happy... So why the hell are they playing killer bunny tag, in the dark woods, with bears and such?! BTW, the teacher is a complete, and udder psychopath. Just saying.<br />
<br />
So, this anime is complete garbage, but compared to Attack on Titan, SAO, Naruto, Sailor Moon ect. It is a complete masterpiece! And that is why my rating for this series, is a solid 10 cheesey mustaches, out of 10.<br />

    Are you the type that feels a sharp pain in the chest when someone madly adorable and incredibly innocent gets hurt? If you are, Anne will constantly soothe and drop kick your heart.<br />
<br />
Many shows that focus on any variety of &quot;cute girls doing cute things&quot; forget to add something that stands in contrast to the cuteness, effectively rendering it far less intense. Anne Happy manages to merge a number of likeable characters, most notably Anne herself, with endless misfortune that causes variable suffering, again most notably to Anne. The result of this is a very intense rollercoaster of emotion, fortunately with far more laughs and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262122">
        heartwarming than moments of sadness.<br />
<br />
While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just &quot;works&quot; in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities. The art and sound are at first glance certainly unremarkable but fit the feeling of the show like a glove, like the subtle nuances in voices and the images that are not really all that simple but just &quot;clean&quot; and wonderfully consistent.<br />
<br />
My favorite moments are when Anne&#039;s god level bad luck strikes in ways that don&#039;t really hurt her, the fact that the events are already sort of impossible from the start and get even more outrageous down the road actually makes it even better, this anime doesn&#039;t take itself too seriously and it feels totally okay. I still cried all 4 season binges every time something managed to really make my adorable little Anne sad though, I&#039;m too sensitive to watch someone so blindingly innocent and pure suffer.

    My score of this is exceptionally high and you may be asking &quot;Why does a generic schoolgirl anime get this rating?&quot;<br />
<br />
Well to be put simply, this anime makes me very happy! Whenever I want something that I can just watch to decompress, this is one of the first shows that I gravitate to.<br />
<br />
Story- 6<br />
My god is the story mediocre as hell. The gimmick in this show gives it a lot of flavor though. In the end, it&#039;s still a cute-girls-do-cute-things episodic plot. Nothing gets too deep since its a slice of life in the end. A lack of depth doesn&#039;t mean that a story is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337487">
        bad though. The plot structure and gimmicks are interesting enough to make this a very enjoyable watch.<br />
<br />
Art- 8<br />
The art style itself is very cute and clean. The color choices are extremely appealing and the character designs are tastefully unique. The animation is nothing to write home about. It services the show well enough but you don&#039;t ever have a moment of &quot;my god this animation is sexy as hell!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sound- 7<br />
I can see the soundtrack being irritating for some people because it is very happy-go-lucky. I personally would listen to the intro outside of the anime. Other than that, the soundtrack doesn&#039;t stand out to me very much.<br />
<br />
Character- 9<br />
Now the characters are hit or miss in this show.<br />
<br />
Hanako was SO IRRITATING. I just don&#039;t like a plain jane happy character. I love characters with spunk and I enjoy when they&#039;re over the top in a cool way. Hanako is just not that. She&#039;s overly cute with little flaws so I don&#039;t even want to hug her or anything.<br />
Hibari was very very very very cute~ She reminds me of a more outwardly chill Hifumi (from NEW GAME!) She definitely compliments the other characters, and would initially be our usual shy character if she didn&#039;t have her crush on the sign. Her romantic interest and embarrassment about it adds some cute depth to her character. I would hug 10/10<br />
Botan was pretty irritating. Her negative demeanor made me roll my eyes constantly. She would be so much better if she was a more ara ara~ MILF type smh.<br />
Hibiki is mildly irritating on her own. She a token tsundere but actually has a reason to be like that. Her love for Ren is very sweet and adds almost a protective side to her character. Her interactions with Ren make for some good gags. By the end of the show, Hibiki was one of my favorites.<br />
Ren was my first waifu (before I knew that waifus were a thing) She has a pretty relaxed and chill demeanor which makes her a good partner for Hibiki&#039;s disheveled personality. Her constant tiredness adds to the cuteness factor too. She&#039;s a character that I look back at with fondness.<br />
<br />
To address the yuri. I APPROVE! Sometimes yuri can be very bad (like in Inugami to Nekoyama ahem) but Ren and Hibiki have a very natural bond. It makes me really happy to see well written yuri and I&#039;m glad that they didn&#039;t have to make a big deal out of it.<br />
<br />
My enjoyment of this anime is obviously very high. It just gives me the fuzzies.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d recommend this show for a snow day when you don&#039;t feel like getting out of bed just yet. Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless.

    I have to say that before watching this anime, I didn&#039;t have much of a liking for cute slice of life anime, I tried some but I never got to really enjoy them, thankfully, this changed with Anne Happy, an adorable and really fun anime.<br />
<br />
I really like the idea of this Anne Happy, basically it&#039;s a group of girls that end up in a school classroom that focuses on fixing the bad luck everyone that is there was born with.<br />

For good or for bad, atleast for me, there were two types of episodes, the ones that were focused on the crazy ideas the school planned

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222107">
        in order to (somehow) make them luckier, that were a blast to watch and the main motive that made me love this anime, and the ones that focus more in the cute SoL situations for the whole episode, that honestly were average at best, they didn&#039;t do anything better than other moe anime would, and just felt empty compared to the other ones.<br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s talk about the characters, like in most of this comedies, they follow a certain personality assigned at the start and have little to no development during the story, sadly, I couldn&#039;t get to like some of them, specially Botan, a girl with poor health and even worse self esteem, her comedy parts got repetitive fast and all the time I felt that if we had a different character instead of her, Anne Happy would have been a lot better.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, on the other side we have Hanako, that is just the most adorable thing ever, she&#039;s also the one with the worst luck and always end up in silly situations, there is also the duo Ren (calm, sleepy girl) + Hibiki (tsundere, I found her quite annoying, but she&#039;s the perfect match for Ren), lastly, Ruri, the most normal (kinda) of the girls completes the group.<br />
<br />
The secondary characters are few but amazing, Kodaira, the teacher, is just so badass and damn, she&#039;s scary when she wants, but in the end she really cares for her students, Timothy is a weird bunny-like robot that helps her and, in my opinion, is the funniest character of this anime, the best moments are when he&#039;s around.<br />
<br />
The art style, like one would expect from a moe anime, is made to be cute, I personally like a lot the way the studio Silver Link handles the artistic part, and with this anime they delivered again.<br />
<br />
The voice actors are great and fit well with the characters, I specially love the work of Yumiri Hamamori in the voice of Hanako, it&#039;s as adorable as it can be.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m honestly speechless with the opening+ending combination Anne Happy has, both songs, PUNCH☆MIND☆HAPPINESS and Ashita de Ii kara, are fantastic and grew up on me, the background themes during the episodes are kind of there, none of them stand out, nor are memorable, but it&#039;s nothing I expected neither.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re a fan of cute slice of life anime, I really recommend to watch Anne Happy, if it focused a bit more on the original school elements it has it would have been ever better, but it&#039;s still an enjoyable anime from start to end and one I&#039;m sure you will have a good time with.<br />

    Luck.  We all have varying degrees of it.  I&#039;m sure there are some of you out there that have the best luck possible and conveniently get nice things come to you cause hey, random chance.  Others...like me, however, don&#039;t really have that luxury and varying degrees of misfortune befall us.  So to bring attention to such a problem, Silver Link has brought us their new work, Anne Happy, or Unhappy as I have grown accustomed to calling this show and...wow, there aren&#039;t many words to accurately describe this.<br />
<br />
Story: Our story begins with Hibarigaoka Ruri, a first year high schooler who begins

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221653">
        her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.  After rescuing this...rather unfortunate girl, Ruri learns that this girl&#039;s name is Hanakoizumi Anne, another girl who is also in this mysterious Class 7.  Upon arriving at school, they find out that this Class 7 is known as the &#039;Happiness Class&#039; where the curriculum and reason for existence is to try to help out the girls who have been dealt a bad hand in life and are classified as extremely unlucky in hopes of helping their situation.  Oh boy, this is gonna be good.<br />
<br />
The basic premise of Unhappy is following the story of 5 specific girls in the Happiness Class as they go through their crazy curriculum of various tasks to try and improve their innate luck through the usage of various activities.  The show plays off like your generic, standard moe show with the twist being that literally nothing goes right in this show and everything that these girls do is so out there and crazy that it just becomes the kind of slapstick entertainment that&#039;s just fun to watch.  Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.  <br />
<br />
Though as far as positives go, that&#039;s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it&#039;s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it&#039;s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Unique premise<br />
+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment<br />
-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running around<br />
<br />
Characters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren&#039;t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.<br />
<br />
Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we&#039;re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her &#039;unlucky&#039; factor isn&#039;t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the &#039;straight man&#039; amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we&#039;re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we&#039;re never really explained on them.  It&#039;s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.<br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She&#039;s walking over a bridge, it&#039;ll break and she&#039;ll fall through.  She walks normally, she&#039;ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series&#039;s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she&#039;s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she&#039;s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.<br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl&#039;s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn&#039;t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.<br />
<br />
And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can&#039;t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.  <br />
<br />
As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don&#039;t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would&#039;ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they&#039;re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast<br />
+ Good side characters<br />
-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them<br />
-  Some hinted backstory but no execution<br />
<br />
Art: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you&#039;re not a fan of cute, well, here&#039;s your forewarning.<br />
<br />
Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute &#039;What&#039;, as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Colorful and consistent artstyle<br />
+ Watercolor backgrounds<br />
+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series<br />
+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)<br />
<br />
Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as &#039;Punch Mind&#039; sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn&#039;t the best, but it&#039;s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it&#039;s good, but compared to the OP, it&#039;s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, &quot;I am watching this.&quot;  Due to the show&#039;s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.<br />
<br />
Did I like this anime?<br />
<br />
While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako&#039;s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it&#039;s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of &#039;We can never win&#039;.  (I know, I&#039;m a bad person.)<br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I like about this anime?<br />
<br />
Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri&#039;s backstory, Kodaira&#039;s hinted backstory, and Timothy&#039;s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might&#039;ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this series?<br />
<br />
If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre.

    There are a lot of slice of life shows which involve cute girls doing cute things and because of this, a lot of them end up being similar to one another in many ways. Despite many of those series throwing in a twist or two to differentiate themselves from one another, the similarities make most of them not feel like anything special. However, even if a series isn&#039;t anything special, it can still be entertaining and enjoyable and Anne Happy is one of those series.<br />
<br />
Like most shows in the slice of life genre, there isn&#039;t a plot instead we are just watching events that happen

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221642">
        in the character&#039;s everyday lives. Anne Happy focuses on a group of 5 girls who are each very unlucky in their own way and because of this they are placed into a special class at school. Through-out the series we get to witness the little adventures these girls go on (such as playing a life size version of a board game) and the misfortunes they encounter. The events that happen during each of these episodes are executed fairly well for the most part, they are very light-hearted and are filled with comedy, and even though some events may seem over the top but for this series it works.There are also a large number of comedic moments in each episode and they are funny more often than not (the transitions between scenes are especially funny). The series also makes some subtle references that only add to the comedy. However some of the jokes do get repetitive (especially the ones that include the girls&#039; unlucky traits) which subtracts from the comedy. Even though most episodes have a lot of funny moments, the events as a whole, even though they are fun to watch, don&#039;t really feel like they are anything too special.<br />
<br />
The characters are the weakest area of this show. Because the series seems to focus on the events themselves, the characters don&#039;t really get explored. Out of the main cast of 5 girls, the only character that seems to be explored significantly is Hibari (Hibarigaoka Ruri for those who didn&#039;t watch). The other characters, even though they are not one dimensional, they do lack depth and not much is seen from them other than a couple of traits in their personality. Also the jokes made about the unlucky traits of the characters do get repetitive. However their personalities do work well with each other, none of them seem out of place and none of the interactions with each other seem awkward.<br />
<br />
The art isn&#039;t bad but it&#039;s not something that will blow you away either. Like any show that has cute girls doing cute things, the character designs are very cute and the color palette is very light which fits well for this show. The backgrounds are fairly simple, don&#039;t have too much detail in them and are static for the most part.<br />
<br />
The sound is good but not great and compared to other series it&#039;s not really anything special. The opening and the ending are both very cute with the main VAs singing it but compared to other series that do this, it&#039;s pretty par for the course. However, the VAs do a very good job matching the personality of the character they are playing and portraying their emotions. The background music is very simple and it&#039;s not something you would regularly notice unless you go out of your way to but the music does add to each scene.<br />
<br />
Like many slice of life shows, this isn&#039;t for everyone. If you typically don&#039;t like cute girls doing cute things then you are not going to like this but if you do then this isn&#039;t a bad series to watch. The little adventures these girls go on are interesting to watch and this series is one of the more funny slice of life shows out there. Overall, Anne Happy isn&#039;t going to blow anyone away but it is very fun and entertaining and if you are into this kind of series, it is worth the watch.

    If Bakuon!! was LA&#039;s favourite guilty pleasure of Spring 2016, then Anne Happy is a close second. Starting Anne Happy at a happy note aren&#039;t we?.<br />
<br />
Anne Happy is a rather ironic anime to watch due to the rather happy go lucky cast member going under alot of misfortune and nonchalantly being happy about it even after the misfortune.<br />
<br />
Anne Happy follows the typical &quot;girls doing cute things in a school&quot; but with a weird twist that being that the main cast is trying to cure their own misfortune and show their misfortune at the same time. <br />
<br />
Character-wise they are diverse through their personalities and brand of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221659">
        misfortune. LA&#039;s favourite character was at first Botan Kumegawa voiced by Kiyono Yasuno the unhealthy misfortune, but became Ruri Hibarigaoka voiced by Haruka Shirashi the &quot;tragic love&quot; misfortune as she had the most connecting tissue to the rest of the cast not to mention she interacted with the main cast the most, aside from them the characters do get fleshed out outside from their personalities and misfortune (in a more relational development than a character development, as the character development goes through many running gags through the character misfortune). That being Hibiki Hagyuu voiced by Haruka Yamamura, the &quot;no sense of direction&quot; misfortune along with her best friend *cough* love interest Ren Ekoda voiced by Mayu Yoshioka the&quot;even the girls loves her&quot; misfortune and constantly  sleep deprived. The most interesting character is the main character who&#039;s anime title is based on, An &quot;Hanako&quot; Hanakoizumi voiced by Yumiri Hanamori, who has the WORST luck in the entire anime that her bad luck gets ironic good luck and Hanako is the glue that gets these five unfortunate characters together.<br />
<br />
The animation by Silver Link, has a contrasting animation concerning the unfortunate main cast as everything from the character designs to the backgrounds are extremely bright and noticeable, the anime has that &quot;full bloom&quot; to it&#039;s animation palette which might be slightly too bright at times however. Nonetheless, animation by Silver Link is rather ironic considering the premise.<br />
<br />
The voice acting has some squeakers but most can be given some grace to some level, Hanako, Hibiki and Timothy (the mascot icon for this series) voiced by Chitose Morinaga, nonetheless, LA definitely thought that all the voice cast had lots of fun doing their roles especially with Yumi Hara as Kodaira (the teacher of the main cast), with her tranquil fury to deadpan snarker vocals making Yumi hara, LA&#039;s favourite VA in Anne Happy, because of that voice cast is decent at best, squeaky and &quot;annoying&quot; at worst, in which LA didn&#039;t think it was bad at all.<br />
<br />
 Ohh and LA forgot the egregious amount of yuri undertones ohh the yuri undertones, considering LA is huge sucker for yuri moe...it was something of a guilty pleasure.<br />
<br />
The ending was rather eccentrically hectic and really it gives us the same &quot;status quo is god&quot; with the girls just doing cute things by the end of it, with the Kodaira being the hero of the ending. The only plot thread however that never gets addressed is Timothy&#039;s creator, it&#039;s hinted at MULTIPLE TIMES, but never gets addressed, why is Timothy&#039;s creator monitoring the cast?, does she have bad luck to and trying to cure her own misfortune?.<br />
<br />
Anne Happy is really your typical cute girls doing cute things just with a rather weird yet unique twist to it and because of the entire spectrum of luck got Anne Happy away from the generic &quot;cute girls doing cute things&quot;. &quot;Cute girls doing unfortunate things&quot; and trying to cure them from their misfortune sounds sadistic but really it&#039;s typical moe fair and as LA said at the beginning, it was a guilty pleasure for LA watching Anne Happy.

    What makes Anne Happy different from all the other slice of life moe shows? the characters and setting. The show still maintains the generic slice of life themes with &quot;cute girls doing cute things&quot; but holds a different personality altogether that makes it unique. <br />
<br />
Story: 8: The show is about a class in Tennomifune Academy and all the students have terrible luck, or &quot;bad karma&quot; as the synopsis states. It&#039;s main focus are the three main heroines, each with different personalities and &quot;bad karma&quot; which follow them throughout the show. With the help of their teacher, they strive to have a happy school life instead

          <span style="display: none;" id="review223760">
        of being unhappy with the &quot;bad karma&quot;. Even though the three girls struggle immensely, the show has lots of comedic gags to keep it entertaining and not drain out the viewer.<br />
<br />
Art: 9: Beautiful bright and colourful visuals with a few dark-ish dull colours and scenes to go with the situations for each character. Even if you don&#039;t like the plot, the visuals can keep you watching. <br />
<br />
Sound: 7: Joyful and catchy opening, I also really liked the small piece of music they used between episodes, it actually reminded me of the show Doraemon. <br />
<br />
Character: 8: Anne Happy presents characters with some-what relatable problems. My personal favourite character was Botan, I found her the most relatable as she borderline hates herself. Throughout the show she will make a small comment towards an aspect about herself that she doesn&#039;t like, commonly her appearance. Nonetheless she is an absolute joy to watch, very kind hearted and mature. Ruri has some unique points with her personality and An is very unlucky but still manages to smile.<br />
<br />
Overall, these characters very entertaining to watch, I almost guarantee you will find a character to love. Honestly, each of them are lovable in different ways. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7: Yes, this show was entertaining but the ending was a slip up for me. It lost the &quot;slice of life&quot; premise and I felt like there are still some more things we can learn about the characters. You will also find an episode or two which drags like hell, but be sure to keep your hopes up for this show even if you do land on an episode like that. I found two of these types of episodes. <br />
<br />
Overall, if you like slice of life and moe characters but want a change from the generic personalities then I highly recommend this. You either find it cute and entertaining or still too cliche and boring as hell.  <br />
<br />

    I&#039;m very sorry to say this but,  it&#039;s very hard to find anything positive in this series, other than the art style. I normally like the SOL, school and comedy combination but this is the first time i have ever dropped a series.<br />
<br />
Before going on, i&#039;m just gonna say i dropped the series at episode 3.<br />
<br />
Story: 1/10<br />
as far as i got, there is little to no introduction to any story/backstory of anything in the series, and the story that is explained is so cringeworthy it hurts.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
i simply like the art style of the series.<br />
<br />
Sound: 4/10 <br />
to be completely  honest i didnt like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review223239">
        the OP or the ED, but i&#039;ve heard worse.<br />
<br />
Character: 1/10<br />
The only character in this series that didnt make me cringe all the time was Hanako. Rori unhealthy affection for a freaking sign, was one of the main factors in me dropping the series. Botans constant injuries gets very annoying, very fast. The teacher and Timothy, is both extremely unpleasant character, i didnt find anything entertaining about them, they could have been cut from the series to make it better.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1/10<br />
they took something thats funny and enjoyable, and ran it into the ground, so that allready on Episode 3 it had become so irritating, that i had to stop watching the series.<br />
<br />
Overall: 2/10<br />
Only redeeming factors in this series is the art style.<br />
<br />
TLDR:<br />
Series is bad, cringeworthy, and will leave you wanting to rip your eyes and ears out. could not recommend less. I have never cringed so hard over an anime in my life.

    If somebody managed to get the Timothy rap out of their head, please tell me how.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Slice of Life comedy of the cute girls doing cute things variety, so basically something we&#039;ve all seen a million times before. While this anime sure is cute most of the time, the comedy goes into absurd territory every now and then, which was kinda cool. You either find something to laugh or to feel fuzzy, so it does its job. The only downside in my eyes, is the running gags about the main casts characteristics, which get old pretty fast.<br />
7/10<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Anne Happy is very beautiful to look at. I mean,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222951">
        just look at all these colors! Some episodes highlight this especially, like the one where they&#039;re in the flower garden. They overdid it a little with the &quot;shiny effect&quot; (I know there is an actual term for that, I don&#039;t remember it unfortunately), but in general, this is a feast for the eyes (if you&#039;re into the cute kind of artstyle). I also liked the occasional comedic simplicity, like in the eyecatches.<br />
9/10<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The opening song is so ridiculous, I can&#039;t help but love it. The ending is pretty good too. The voice acting was allright, though they tried rather hard to sound as stereotypical as they could, which wasn&#039;t really necessary in my eyes. There is also the Timothy rap, which is...well, it&#039;s the Timothy rap.<br />
8/10<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
As I mentioned, the focus on the characters one unlucky characteristic does get old fast. Whenever the show decides to do something else with them however, they are all rather likeable. Especially main girl Hanakoizumi. she is just so much fun. I like how, unlike other characters, she is not completely oblivious to her bad luck, but rather decides to have fun anyway. However, I can see the possibility of the characters growing stale in a second season, so...<br />
6/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I had a lot of fun with Anne Happy. The show managed to come up with a couple of entertaining ideas and it had its fair share of feel good episodes. I&#039;m not sure if want another season though, because of the reasons I mentioned above, but for a 12 episode anime, I did enjoy it quite a bit.<br />
8/10<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
7.6/10

    My quick, short review for Anne Happy.<br />
Want a cute funny anime about misfortunes? Then this is for you<br />
<br />
If you want to watch some moe, funny, and heart warming anime then you should go for Anne Happy since it has numbers of skits and really adorable scenes. But if you are looking for the same genre where you want to focus alot on story and development, you might want to avoid this as the anime is a little bit random and quite generic. Either way, the anime provides some good lessons and realizations when you are feeling down in real life and you might relate of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264467">
        some of the main characters. The story is fair, art is good, sound is good, characters are good, quite enjoyable if you don&#039;t have anything else to watch and yes, I give it an overall 7 being a &quot;good&quot; anime.

    NOTE: This MAY contain spoilers!!<br />
<br />
Story: It contains awesome, cute comedic moments in the anime where the characters are trying to overcome their bad luck everyday. Plus, there are also weird moments in the anime that makes you want to question the show more in depth<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Hanako: Always happy (especially whenever she encounters her bad luck).<br />
Hibari: Sweet &amp; kind (I always wondered if she can face her crush on).<br />
Botan: Soft-spoken &amp; kind but always get injured really easily. (Can we please get a wheelchair for her? She&#039;s fragile!! LITERALLY!).<br />
Hibiki: Standoff-ish &amp; showoff-ish. She has a kinder side &amp; has feelings for her best friend (Ren). (I consider

          <span style="display: none;" id="review226252">
        her a tunsdere).<br />
Ren: Cool &amp; tomboy-ish (She is seen constantly sleeping or being surrounded by animals). <br />
<br />
Overall: One of the cutest animes that I have ever watched. Seeing Timothy the bunny is weird but I am wondering when is his next mixtape being released?

    Anne Happy is a slice-of-life comedy about five girls who have extraordinarily bad luck. Because of their terrible luck, the five characters are enrolled in a &quot;Happiness Class&quot; that is supposed to help them with their misfortune. However, instead of offering therapy, this class offers “interesting” (or rather, insane) activities for the girls to participate in, making their already odd lives even crazier.<br />
<br />
Positives-<br />
<br />
The characters are the strongest aspect of Anne Happy. There’s Hanako who experiences misfortune in every sense of the word; Botan who has incredibly poor health to the point where it is ridiculous and funny; Hibiki who has horrible navigational skills and easily

          <span style="display: none;" id="review226492">
        gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.<br />
<br />
With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives. We get to witness all of the crazy things they go through on a daily basis and, frankly, it is fun and amusing. The facts they all have different kinds of luck helps to make things less redundant. You never know what sort of disaster is going to befall them next. When catastrophe does strike, it is usually in a comical manner and the characters struggle through their difficulties in chibi form, giving an extra cutesy vibe to the already adorable atmosphere. The constant chibi portrayals were one of my favorite things about the show&#039;s animation. Overall, the animation gives a unique feeling to the show. Each character has adorable character designs. One thing that particularly stood out was the use of watercolor. The background uses beautiful pastel colors and water color brush marks. The show is extremely colorful and pleasing to the eyes. Another aspect, although quite minute, was the characters&#039; hair, especially Hibari&#039;s. If you look closely, her hair is two shades of purple, but it is blended so well that it is hard to notice. This attention to detail shows much effort the animators put into this show.<br />
<br />
Negatives- <br />
<br />
Firstly, Timothy, a mechanical bunny robot and the mascot of the show, was extremely annoying, in my opinion. Appear-wise, he is adorable; however, his squeaky voice and personality are irritating. But most importantly, whenever Timothy was around, the show focused on him instead of the characters.<br />
<br />
That was my main issue with the show: the story. It is a slice of life anime, meaning that, instead of a clear-cut story, the show is shown through small snapshots of the characters&#039; lives as they go through their daily routines. Because of this, most SOL anime have little, if any, story or plot. Anne Happy is much the same. However, instead of really focusing on the girls&#039; everyday lives, it focuses their experiences in the insane &quot;Happiness Class.&quot; This class, as I mentioned earlier, does all kind of ludicrous things to make the students happier. Some highlights include a life-size board game, a virtual casino, and a game of tag that was more like a man hunt.<br />
Seeing what sort of silly scenario the class had to go through was entertaining, but the show focused too much on the spontaneity of the &quot;Happiness Class.&quot; The show should have focused on learning more about the characters as people. Was there a reason for their bad luck? How did their bad luck affect their families and friends? How do the girls react to the constant stream of misfortune that seems to follow them? Does Hibari ever find a love outside of a sign post? In my opinion, this would have been much more interesting to explore than robotic rabbits and a school with an obviously outrageous amount of spending money.<br />
<br />
Yuri-<br />
<br />
Based on your personal preferences, yuri can be a good or bad thing. While it is not entirely yuri-based, Anne Happy definitely did have some yuri. The most yuriish moments are between Hibiki and Ren. As I said earlier, Ren attracts female animals because of her charm. However, it isn&#039;t just nonhuman species that like her. Human females are attracted to her as well, including Hibiki. As the series goes on, a lot of hints about Hibiki&#039;s feelings for Ren are thrown in. If you want heavy yuri, you would need to look elsewhere, but if you are interested in adorable shojou ai, I definitely recommend Anne Happy for a cute yuri fix.<br />
<br />
Despite some of its flaws, I really enjoyed Anne Happy&#039;s concept, animation, yuri, and its adorable and unique take on slice of life. Overall, I would give it an 8 out of 10.

    This is My first time review I will write this review with my best English(I not often Eng too much in my life) <br />
I want to tell you some thing if you finished or watch for first time<br />
<br />
If you watch this for first time and like Yuri Shounen Ai this was some good show it make some cute lovely and very Yuri  , you should not expect for Anne happy to much. <br />
<br />
(Alert!!  down sentence have some spoil but the spoil dont sensitive to main story because Anne happy weak story it just a secrets plot.)<br />
<br />
<br />
This show was old show but I will

          <span style="display: none;" id="review291413">
        surprised when I hear theory of Anne Happy.<br />
and I rewatch again,and I find many scene to make Anne happy have valuable than I think.<br />
<br />
This theory was about director tell former of hibari(Blue hair girls)so vaguely.<br />
<br />
when you watched  Anne happy it hard to believe this show was psychological and Social reflection.<br />
Because director hide this with lovely tone and communicate with some scene you will interested about them this is past of hibari.<br />
But I observe every episodes of Anne Happy on every scene and I find many scene just very sad and scare thing.<br />
<br />
The past of hibari look like some good joke to use in comedy plot ,she love construction mascot too much almost want to marry with them but why? <br />
You should to focus too hibari scene in every episodes you will find it like I find.<br />
For example<br />
She say goodbye before go to school alone in her bedroom , she make sad face many time, She say past of her family like&quot;Before, I was happy with my family.&quot;<br />
Not confident in her self , some scene she dont talk any thing and absent-minded.<br />
<br />
Finally I want to tell you The Anne happy in hibari past director tell her past vaguely<br />
when you rewatch this the theory will be true!<br />
<br />
Thankyou for you reading  ^w^&quot;
