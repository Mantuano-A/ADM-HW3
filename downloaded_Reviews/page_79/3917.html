    .Hack//Sign is a single part in the Project .Hack franchise, one that combines novels, manga, TV anime and OVA&#039;s to form one grand narrative with characters and events happening not only chronologically, but simultaneously as well. The review below is written from the franchise point of view, and as an standalone anime.<br />
<br />
The general consensus of Hack//Sign is that the story&#039;s boring, there is almost no action and it doesn&#039;t make fast progress. While some of these points are quite true, the story is one of character development and interaction. The viewer learn more about every side character through their interaction with the rest of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5667">
        cast, their surroundings and gradually helps move the plot. The plot is one of clashing and matching personalities, driven by mysteries.<br />
<br />
.Hack//Sign, The story:<br />
+ It&#039;s detailed<br />
- It does feel slow at times<br />
<br />
Then, we have the art, fun scenery&#039;s and great character designs do give you the feel of an online game world that was actually thought out (see the games .hack//IMOQ and .hack//Frägment). The animation however, is quite sloppy and the characters themselves aren&#039;t drawn very detailed.<br />
<br />
+ The art does create the illusion of an actual MMORPG<br />
+ Great and original character designs<br />
<br />
Then we have the Sound, if there was an option to give it more then a ten out of ten, then I would choose it. The compositions by Yuki Kajiura, are in my opinion, what lifts the anime up from a meagre 7 to a 10. With an enormous array of songs and tunes, Yuki adds depth to the art and the story, giving it time when the characters need time and hypes the viewer when it&#039;s going down.<br />
<br />
+ Yuki Kajiura&#039;s music is truly a work of art<br />
<br />
The characters of .Hack//Sign are gamers, and thus some try to act online like someone they aren&#039;t. Some take their offline situations into the game and some try to forget them instead.<br />
Complex emotions and double personalities are just some of the things you can find here.<br />
<br />
+ Character actually have character progress without it being important to the main storyline

    To the many people who play them, video games, can be a form of escapism from the real world. What could be more stress relieving than diving into a fantasy world where you assume the role of the character in the game? It sounds very tempting but if one should stay too long in the virtual world you could lose yourself in it with no way to return to the real world. In the worst case scenario you may forget which world is real and which is fake. <br />
<br />
That is the premise of .Hack//Sign. .Hack//Sign is a part of the .Hack series which surrounds the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21213">
        MMORPG called “The World” and the different characters who find the mysteries surrounding this virtual land.<br />
<br />
.Hack//Sign follows the story of Tsukasa, a Wavemaster (Spell caster) in “The World”, who suddenly wakes up in a dark dungeon with no recollection of how he got there and what he was doing prior to his collapse. While trying to gather his bearings a female Heavy Blade (sword wielder) by the name of Mimiru passes by and strikes a conversation with him. To her surprise Tsukasa instantly warps back to the town leaving her behind. It’s while he is in town that Tsukasa realizes that he can’t log out of “The World”. He is trapped in the virtual world with no way to get back to reality. <br />
<br />
If your thinking this will be an action packed show with monster fighting and adventuring you would be mostly wrong. While there is small tidbits of fighting and adventuring this show is very slow paced and mostly revolves around Tsukasa and the people he interacts with. .Hack//Sign also has noticeable dark elements to it especially when the real world is involved. The idea of escapism is really brought out when you see the character’s real life counterparts and the struggles they go through. But that is just a small part as Sign is mostly set in “The World”. <br />
<br />
Due to the slow pacing every character in this show has a chance to develop and feel more realistic. “The World” allows characters to express themselves in a way that the real world doesn’t allow. The result of this is that characters are intriguing to watch and thus provide a deep story. However this slow pace does cause most people to drop the show, as the pacing may be a little too slow and sometimes it feels that some scenes drag on. Another problem is the ending which is very abrupt and quick. I won’t spoil anything but let’s just say there is a reason why this is a part of a series of Anime shows and games. Overall the story is solid and enticing.<br />
<br />
The animation in .Hack//Sign is a very well done and fits the fantasy setting of “The World”. Every location has its own emotional feel that lends itself well to the slow pace of the show. The uniqueness of each area helps set the tone for the current situation in the Anime, as each area has its own theme and setting that really makes “The World” feel as big as the real world. Tropical forests, barren deserts and frozen wastelands litter the land with vibrancy. While this is true for the virtual world, the real world on the other hand resembles old black and white silent films.<br />
<br />
The real world is depicted as bleak and hopeless as text show up to replace verbal sound. This contrast between the vibrant virtual world and bleak real world becomes very important in portraying how “The World” seems to be a perfect escape from real life issues. The character designs are also very well done, since each character has their own design which fit the grander design that “The World” sets up. There are some parts that were a little bit grainy as I would call yet overall the design of this virtual world is truly something to appreciate.<br />
<br />
The music and overall sound in .Hack//Sign is where it really sets itself apart from other anime. The opening song Obsession gives off a feeling of trance and emptiness that really fits the mood of .Hack//Sign while the background music has a sense of tranquility and sadness that backs up the visual aspect of the show. The music also has a folklore aspect in a sense that it makes you feel like it’s telling a story or possibly narrating the situation your currently watching. One big plus is the background music with vocals in them. Key of the Twilight is one of the best songs in the soundtrack and really exemplifies how music is able to set the tone of a scene and possibly the show. However there are some points where the music overpowers a certain scene in the show which can ruin the mood but it rarely happens. So my advice is to pay attention the music as it can really pull you into the story and set the mood.<br />
<br />
Overall .Hack//Sign is something that shouldn’t be overlooked. The story of escapism gone wrong will leave you wondering if this could happen to you. The animation is compelling and imaginative while the music really sets the emotional tone of the show. I must warn you again that if you hate slow paced shows or want some action then steer clear of this show but for those who want a good mystery with a fantasy setting then.Hack// Sign is for you.

    **THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS**<br />
<br />
Okay, well, this anime is kind of awful.<br />
<br />
Chronologically, this isn&#039;t even the first in the .hack// timeline, because Bandai keeps tacking shit onto this franchise. Anyway, it&#039;s basically about what would happen if Shinji Ikari played video games. Tsukasa, the main character, wakes up in The World, the first Virtual Reality MMORPG since some supervirus stomped all over the internet. He can&#039;t remember how he got there or who he is, and soon discovers that he can&#039;t even log out of the damn game. After running into some douchebags who want to jump his ass for supposedly hacking, he acquires some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25338">
        wacky ass jello bullshit that flies around and kicks peoples asses for him. From there, Tsukasa and his friends attempt to figure out the reason as to why he can&#039;t log out, and end up unraveling the dark secrets about what The World really is.<br />
<br />
Sound cool? I thought so too. As it turns out, Bee Train pulled a fast one and replaced all the cool aspects of playing an MMORPG (like bitchin&#039; ass spells, gunblades, implying other player&#039;s parents are really the same gender, etc.) with half-assed attempts at exploring the concepts of escapism, and how interpersonal relationships affect us as humans. Now, I consider myself a sophisticated member of society. I have no problem with slow paced, character driven shows, but if I&#039;m going to be watching a show that&#039;s 85 percent dialogue, I&#039;m expecting a lot more in terms of plot and character development than what I was given. They even managed to fuck up the lesbian undertones by making one of them a cripple. Come on, Bee Train, cripple porn? I never thought you&#039;d sink that low.<br />
<br />
The art is fantastic. Beautifully painted backgrounds, imaginative character designs (although that&#039;s to be expected, considering they were done by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto) and for the most part top notch animation come together to make the anime really stand out. Plot aside, if you really dig artsy shit, you&#039;ll be able to appreciate the detail that went into the show.<br />
<br />
The sound is great too. The soundtrack has a way of both perfectly fitting and amplifying the tone of the scene, and the voice acting is pretty awesome as well. <br />
<br />
As for the characters, they start off as your typical bunch of anime cliches but then the metric fuckton of dialogue hits and character development starts to make its way through. Tsukasa starts off as a stoic jerkass who develops into Shinji Ikari: Part Deux, Mimiru is the happy-go-lucky only-sane-one (especially considering the dysfunction junction that is the rest of the cast) who plays the game for fun, Bear is the cool old guy/big damn hero/Shepard, BT is the condescending information broker (who hates lettuce, remember that), the Silver Knight is the cliche shounen hero that FIGHTS FOR JUSTICE who, through character development, stops being so bombastic and douchey and starts being a more approachable big damn hero, Subaru is the shrinking violet/woman in charge with a twist, Crim is the ridiculously over-the-top large ham with unrealistic hair and an unnervingly large sense of honor, Helba is the hacker, Sora is the lovable jerkass who assaults women in-game, etc. Most of them seem to take more pleasure in standing around talking to each other about their real lives than in actually playing the game, though. I guess that&#039;s the point, seeing as the anime is all about interpersonal relationships, but it certainly does bog down the dialogue with a lot of useless information. And implications about lesbian cripples. Ugh.<br />
<br />
Overall, if you like boring shit, you&#039;ll love .hack//SIGN.

    Overview:<br />
<br />
Before SAO, before Log Horizon, there was .hack//Sign. This was the anime that started the &quot;trapped in an MMORPG&quot; craze in anime. Although it is far superior in quality to SAO and Log Horizon, it somehow has an average rating almost 2 full points lower. Allow me to explain why this is a great injustice!<br />
<br />
Story and characters: 7/10<br />
<br />
The story will no doubt seem familiar at this point, because so many series have ripped off .hack. After a computer virus devastates the internet, a new web system is created and shortly after a massive MMORPG using virtual reality is born as the brain child of a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review165801">
        German computer genius with mysterious motives. A player called Tsukasa finds himself trapped in this fantasy MMORPG and is unable to logout, but is not aware why or even who he is in the real world. This is only a problem for Tsukasa and no other players are effected by this. What makes .Hack unique is that Tsukasa dying in the game world doesn&#039;t mean he will die in the real world. Instead, he just respawns and is still trapped, like an eternal purgatory. Tsukasa must discover the mystery of why he is trapped and find out more about this MMORPG and why it was created. The pacing in this series is slow, so it will take a while to get good. However, I appreciate that this series unlike SAO or Log Horizon focuses mostly on character development and psychological drama rather than pointless action and fanservice. Afterall, duel wielding eventually gets a little stale. &quot;Jesus Christ SAO! Duel Wielding isn&#039;t THAT cool, tone it down guys!&quot; - John Woo <br />
<br />
art: 6/10<br />
<br />
The character designs are good, but the animation is sometimes lacking. Most of the time, people are standing around talking and this isn&#039;t exactly going to blow you away with its visuals. Hack was made by a small animation studio called Beeline best known for &quot;hits&quot; like Noir and Spider Riders for Kids WB. Yes, there is an anime called Spider Riders, and it is just as bad as it sounds!<br />
<br />
Soundtrack: 10/10<br />
<br />
Hack is probably most well known for its outstanding sound track that features a new song in every episode. At one point the OST fetched outlandishly high prices on E-bay, but I am not sure what it is worth today. It is still an excellent sound track and comes highly recommended.<br />
<br />
Entertainment: 7/10<br />
<br />
Yes, I will admit that it can be a bit slow at times. That doesn&#039;t mean it is a bad series. The drama and character development make this one worth watching.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7/10<br />
<br />
This anime does have some issues with animation, pacing, and a few minor flaws. However, it is a LOT better than SAO or Log Horizon! Don&#039;t be a n00b! If you watch 1 trapped in an MMORPG anime, make bloody well sure it is this one!

    .hack//SIGN is perhaps not exactly what you may think it is, but I think you&#039;ll be pleasantly surprised. It has hardly any action, contrary to what it may seem like, and the main focus of this story is on the characters. But it is done in such an appealing way that I personally found myself not wanting to sleep until I found out how it ended. I&#039;ll warn you: .hack//SIGN isn&#039;t flashy and exciting; but it does have some fantastic qualities to make up for that fact. So let&#039;s break this down.<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
.hack//SIGN is about a virtual reality MMORPG ( Massive Multi-player Online Role Playing Game

          <span style="display: none;" id="review64015">
        ) called &quot;The World.&quot; In The World, players determine what class they would like to become, and then set out to play the game however they see fit. Some play in parties, while others choose to play solo. In this game, we meet several interesting and amusing characters - all who are playing the game differently, but whose paths fatefully cross at one point or another. But most notably of these characters, we meet Tsukasa: the ever troubled protagonist of this story. Tsukasa is met with a problem never before seen in The World: he can not log out. Stuck in the game, he is forced to face the fact that he might not even want to return to reality; but the many people whom he encounters during his stay in the game seem to be determined to figure out the mystery surrounding him, and return him safely to the real world.<br />
<br />
Now...the story moves slow. Like I&#039;ve said, there are not any flashy battles nor explosions, and what little action there is is very mundane...So, do not watch //SIGN expecting to be wowed by action scenes. That being said, there are some things that are left unexplained...but all those unexplained things CAN be explained if you read the manga. So, if you like the series and you find yourself wanting to know more about just what in the heck happened, then check out the manga or the novel of the same title.<br />
<br />
Alright. The true heart of this story is in the characters. So let&#039;s move on.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS:<br />
.hack//SIGN consists of enticing characters; each with their own stand out qualities, motives, pasts, and subsequently, problems. In fact, I must say that every character in //SIGN is extremely interesting - I found myself relating to many of them in different aspects of their personalities, and in how they handled situations...which is a very welcome feeling, as many times, characters in anime seem to be a bit far fetched as to how they deal with certain occurrences.<br />
<br />
The character development is suburb; mainly because the characters are the main focal point of the entire story. So much time is spent delving into their hearts, feelings, and minds that one can not help but get attached.<br />
<br />
ART:<br />
Its got its quirks and problems, but all around, the animators did a good job. The animators made The World a beautiful place, while also a tad bit frightening in some areas. But I&#039;m not too good at reviewing art, so I&#039;ll end this portion here and you can decide for yourself.<br />
<br />
MUSIC:<br />
Excuse me while I squee with joy. *ahem* This is one of my favorite soundtracks. Yuki Kajiura at her finest. Every track fits The World to a T; and one can&#039;t help but feel like they&#039;re inside the game in some parts. Aside from the perfect fit of the songs, they are also emotional, exciting, and just plain fun.<br />
<br />
If you decide in the end that you do not want to watch .hack//SIGN, at least go listen to the soundtrack; it is pure enjoyment.<br />
<br />
OVERALL:<br />
I loved this series. I&#039;d watch it again in a heartbeat. To me, its only downfalls were that there could have been a little more action, but it wasn&#039;t necessary to the story, and that they should have explained more in the anime. But aside from these things, my enjoyment of this series was very high. I recommend you at least give it a shot. You never know until you try! I did, and I am not in the least bit disappointed. And even if you do not find yourself a fan of the story...engage yourself in its soundtrack!

    This is a review compiled by the many members of the VIA (Value In Anime) Graveyard Division. All members who have worked on this review are mentioned at the bottom. In addition, this review will also contain a “Value in the Anime” section detailing life lessons and values that make this anime worth watching.<br />
-------------------<br />
.hack//sign isn&#039;t exactly new. Known for it&#039;s slow pace, it has a reputation as a poorly paced, often boring show. While this is true, to an extent, there is still value in this anime--life lessons that make it worth the time you&#039;re willing to invest in it. <br />
<br />
Story: .hack//sign is a slow

          <span style="display: none;" id="review117425">
        anime with an episodic format and plot to match. Often, you may feel that you might have to go back and re-watch an episode or two because might have missed something in the last scene.<br />
<br />
The pacing was bad and would have been much, much better as a one cour (12-13 episodes) series. The impact of the plot was lessened by the postponement of the primary conflict, which was not introduced until about halfway through. The ending ultimately lost impact because of the story telling, which was more or less average.<br />
<br />
Understandably, there are also some parts, especially prevalent in the OVAs, where you had to have prior knowledge for full understanding. The OVAs themselves added little to the story, mostly giving a sense of &quot;all&#039;s-well-that-ends-well.&quot; It does try to be realistic in it&#039;s approach, though it doesn&#039;t always succeed. <br />
<br />
Art: The animation style is decent, but outdated, and doesn&#039;t quite manage to hold up to today&#039;s standards--though this is to be expected. The character designs were varied and distinct while the backgrounds, though predominately dark, were aesthetically pleasing. For the most part, the animation was smooth and the jerking and stills were kept to an acceptable minimum--problems consistent with many other older anime. <br />
<br />
Sound:. hack//sign&#039;s music and sound fit well. The OST complimented the mood while the OP and ED were catchy, though otherwise unmemorable. At times, the background music was a tad overbearing-- a fault that often resulted in a ruined atmosphere. Standing alone, the music can be drab at times, but proves to be sufficient overall.<br />
<br />
Characters: This is .hack//sign&#039;s focal point. Character development is initially slow, but speeds up later on in the anime. The characters are interesting, and almost all of them contribute to the plot at some point--one of them receiving extra development during the first OVA. No characters appears similar to another, and they are easy to relate to, though they can be dull at times. The villain is good, but suffers from a lack of impact as the episodes draw on. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: In essence, this is a slow anime with poor pacing that often left us wanting more. It&#039;s worth a try if this appeals to you, but it will not keep everyone who watches awake. Because of how slow it is, it would probably be best if you watched this anime over a long period of time. Try watching as a substitute for pills or lullabies.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is nice to listen to, but gets a little tiring after a while and the art is worth a look, even if it isn’t the best. The characters deserve more than a passing glance, being the primary draw of the show. <br />
<br />
Values in the Anime: There is value in this anime that makes it worth watching--certain life lessons that we can all learn through anime.<br />
<br />
Accepting Reality: This anime shows us how dangerous it is to get absorbed in entertainment. This is an issue especially present in today&#039;s society, where everyone is on their phone or computer at almost all times. It’s good to have fun and get absorbed, but also important to stay grounded in reality as well. Recognizing that line between entertainment and reality is paramount. <br />
<br />
Games are a way to express yourself; they are a way to act as someone you’re not. No matter what though, remember that these things should stay in the game; they are exclusive to the laws of the game for a reason. Accept reality for what it is, and know the difference while maintaining a balance.<br />
<br />
Respecting Others: Respecting others is important in real life, but can be equally so in a game or online. The main character is initially rude and unlikeable, but finds the value in those basic concepts throughout the development of the story and improves themselves as a person. Connecting to other people, and observing how it affects you is of the upmost importance, and is a message strongly conveyed in .hack//sign.<br />

    As a former hard core gamer, I had high expectations of this series which has been languishing in my list of stuff to someday get to watching. So I started viewing this intending to finish all the .hack series.<br />
<br />
Story/Character<br />
<br />
The premise is exciting - one player in &amp;quot;The World&amp;quot; is suddenly unable to log out - why? The mystery gets deeper and deeper as we are pulled into his life and the life of the other characters (in game and in the real world) who either want to help him, want to solve the mystery or have some other hidden agendas of their own.<br />
<br />
The set up

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9146">
        (first 8 episodes) was very well done. Just as I started to get fascinated the series went on a philosophical bent and the plot stagnated. By the time it tried to recover I was frankly pretty bored and was just going through the motions of finishing the series.<br />
<br />
The characters are a mish mash. Some you remember and some could actually have been left out of the anime without making any impact at all. It was hard to even like any of them except 1-2 (you&#039;ll know what I mean).<br />
<br />
Art/Animation and sound<br />
<br />
The animation was great for that time. Very cute and I can see where &amp;quot;World of Warcraft&amp;quot; may have copied some of the stuff. Songs were pretty decent but not as good as the art. It&#039;s a very pretty anime and as a gamer I was satisfied with both.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
<br />
The series starts well, gets slow in the middle and tries to end with a bang but somewhat fails to pull it together. The end is ambiguous which detracts from overall enjoyment, hence the low score.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
<br />
This is one of those polarizing anime. You either love it or you hate it. There are a lot of similarities to &amp;quot;Serial Experiments Lain&amp;quot; (which I hated) but I scored this a lot higher due to the effort it took to make the gaming world realistic, which I really appreciated. Overall I gave this a 5 -- there was much more that this series could have done that they didn&#039;t do, and the slow pace really made this less enjoyable than I would have liked.<br />
<br />

    I came into .Hack//Sign with mixed reviews and no knowledge of the characters or the plot / setting. I was pretty skeptical because a couple of my really good friends said it was very boring. Then again I had friends that said it was amazing. With that being said, i just had to see for myself.<br />
<br />
Right off the bat I need to address one HUGE CON of this anime. The use of flashbacks and how many episodes they used. The large majority of .hack//sign was used having flashbacks. But not even stuff that we haven&#039;t seen yet. There was one scene  (that was several

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23482">
        minutes long) that was played AT LEAST 10 times in the series. Not to mention for a WHOLE episode they did a review of everything that had happened thus far. When you are dealing with an anime that is only 26 episodes long there is no need to do a 20 minute recap of everything that happened in the first 14 episodes! I can understand if you are on episode 150 and want to recap what has happened, because a lot of information can be forgot... but not in 14 episodes.<br />
<br />
It is my personal opinion that this anime could have been finished in 12 episodes. There were moments when the anime was boring as all Hell. Where I wanted to just say &quot;screw it&quot; and go to the next anime or skip that episode. There is tons of pointless information that could have been left out or scenes that were just not necessary. But in the end, within a couple episodes it had my attention again.<br />
<br />
Now for some Pros. There was many times in the series where I was very into the series. For example the Grunty scene where Su Casa was searching for the purple berries. It was very emotional and kept me on the edge of my seat. I did find myself yelling at the characters from time to time, At how stupid they were or in anticipation of what would happen next. <br />
<br />
There were many characters that I connected with. For example Sora. Sora was by far one of the greatest characters on the anime. His use of humor and whatnot was unparalleled. <br />
<br />
In the end the anime was good. It had its cons and pros. But evened out the anime was good. even Though it was good, the chances of me watching it again are not too high. <br />
<br />
I recommend watching it at least once and come with your own conclusion.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 8 / 10<br />
Rewatch value: Low

    In early 2004, 3 1/2 years before my foray into anime, I bought a PS2 game called .hack//Infection. I didn&#039;t particularly enjoy the game that much, and it became lost behind the newer games that came and were added to my ever-growing video game collection.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to November 2007, and I stumble across .hack//SIGN while flicking through the channels one night. I decided to watch it, and I became immediately hooked.<br />
<br />
One of the strong points of the .hack video game was the story, and the story to SIGN was also brilliantly written. I also loved the art and the characters were a lovable motley crew,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3512">
        of sorts.<br />
<br />
The music fitted in well with the atmosphere of the series. The celtic influence was notable in both scenery and music.<br />
<br />
A lot of people say this dragged on, &amp;quot;They&#039;ve all got weapons, but there&#039;s no fighting.&amp;quot; Ah, well. So what? I didn&#039;t care. I&#039;m never one to care about the pace of a telly programme, film or video game etc.<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed the series, and it pulled me in further into the world of anime.<br />
<br />
And, because of the series, Infection was pulled out from behind the newer games, and played once again. (And was completed this time around.)

    First impressions of &quot;Hack Sign&quot;... stunningly good animation and excellent music.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately there&#039;s not much more to it. This is an anime with a weak story line that contain more holes than Swiss cheese, and tries to make up for it by pretending to be deep. What they don&#039;t seem to realise is that there&#039;s more to being deep than having the characters do little more than stand around looking thoughtful and utter the occasional grunt whilst elegant music drifts past in the background. You need GOOD dialogue and storyline to be deep, and as hard as this anime tries, it doesn&#039;t have either. &quot;Hack Sign&quot;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23864">
        is a prime example of how to make a dialogue heavy anime that is dull (for an example of a good dialogue heavy anime, look no further than &quot;Crest of the Stars&quot;).<br />
<br />
One of the main problems is that nothing ever happens in &quot;Hack Sign&quot;. They would have had difficulty making this into a decent 13 episode anime, let alone a 26 episode one. What kept me watching was mainly the aesthetic pleasure that&#039;s derived from the gorgeous animation and music. Also, at the end of several episodes along the way, it does show flashes of brilliance with some chilling scenes that promised much... but ultimately delivered very little, if at all.<br />
<br />
Characters aren&#039;t much to be remembered by. I found myself spending a lot of time wondering why they were all so serious... they&#039;re playing a game ffs. People like to joke and play about in games. These guys on the other hand, prefer to stand around talking about their real life issues... in total, they must have spent a whole five minutes or so on playing the actual game! No wonder most of them seem really low level! And what&#039;s the big deal about about player killing? Having played these kind of games myself, I know it&#039;s an integral part of the gameplay, but this anime makes it out to be some sort of bad practice, and kicks up a huge fuss over it, even though people can just respawn afterwards. The accumulative result of all of this is that it didn&#039;t feel at any point that they were playing an MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online RPG). <br />
<br />
Throughout the anime, especially in the beginning, I often found it hard to understand the motivation behind a lot of the character&#039;s actions, which made the story and characters of &quot;Hack Sign&quot; feel very artificially driven. For example, if something serious happened like a player could not log out and is stuck in the game, wouldn&#039;t that make the game potentially very dangerous? You would think that it would get shut down at this point, but apparently no one cares about such a trivial matter, and players carry on playing the game as usual, as though it&#039;s no big deal. At least not all the characters are devoid of charm though, and after a while (a long while, admittedly), I did start to warm up to a couple of them like Crim (who is quite cool, and actually seem to be interested in playing the game).<br />
<br />
The ending... what the hell was all that about? They dragged the anime through 20+ episode just to reach THAT kind of conclusion? It was almost getting exciting towards the end, but the extremely anti-climatic &quot;climax&quot; just brought my ratings for this anime crashing back down again. I think that must have been the worst conclusion ever. After spending the majority of the series hyping up the &quot;mystery&quot;, it barely explained anything. Throughout the anime I kept waiting for things to become clearer, and they never did. And also, &quot;Evidence&quot; must be the sh*ttest recap episode I&#039;ve ever seen. All it did was sum up all the the parts you don&#039;t understand and make you realise that there were even more of them than you remembered. It pretty much encapsulates contents of this anime - a royal mess.

    I think this is one of the best Animes, amongst many others. .hack//SIGN intrigued me, and actually made me wonder. Not to mention the occasional chill sent down my spine. While it may be confusing it beats most clich&amp;eacute;d RPG-Based Animes and Fantasy base Anime out there. The cliff hangers leave you waiting and wanting more. Even though it doesn&#039;t have so much action in it I think it is great. Beats the crap out of Pokemon, and Final Fantasy. What I love about this is it&#039;s so mysterious, and dark, and unpredictable. Unlike with Final Fantasy, Zelda, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh and so on. The music

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4426">
        is great to. The acting was great, the best I have ever seen. This is one of the bests in my opinion. In Fact .hack//SIGN is the first Anime I have seen, that was actually dark. With the many surprises in there, I have never been the same. There are many great characters in this series, some goofy, others serious, and just plain lovable. Tsukasa is a highly emotional enigma. Subaru is a personal fav. of mine. She&#039;s sweet, and cute. And they didn&#039;t try to hard to make them funny, or make their jokes funny. &amp;quot;Tsukasa, let&#039;s play red light green light!&amp;quot; -Sora. That was the best gag I have ever heard. David Whittenburg did wonders for Sora. And the Chrimson Knights. And A-20 is an adorable character<br />
<br />
Very wonderful animation by Bee-Train along Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, Minako Shiba, Satoshi Oshawa and others. They have tone, to their bodies, and the EFX are wonderful. There is some cell shading, but it&#039;s light, and doesn&#039;t stick out like a sore thumb.<br />
<br />
Wonderful songs by Yuki Kajiura (FLCL, Fiction, Boogie Pop, NOIR, MADLAX) wonderful blend of Ambiance, and Orchestral sound. And mix of pop, and classical, makes it just right. I have two sound tracks to the show, and one to the game. And it&#039;s just wonderful. The songs are memorable, and greatly composed. Music is very important to me, and Yuki pulled it off nicely.<br />
<br />
Great voicing. Brianne Siddal, Amanda Win Lee, Kim Guest, and many others, including the man Dave Whitenburg (WHR, Speed Racer, Digimon 03) as the malevolent, yet goofy &amp;quot;Sora&amp;quot; My favorite Quote from Sora &amp;quot;Tsukasa! Let&#039;s play red light green light!&amp;quot; And Valiery Arem as &amp;quot;The Voice&amp;quot; Morgannah. &amp;quot;I need you, as much as you need me. As long as we walk together, I shall protect you.&amp;quot; Kim Guest, plays the sweet Subaru, and she brings her out very nicely.<br />
<br />
Who would have thought up such a novel of a story? It is brilliant. It&#039;s so mysterious, and not predictable. Full of dialog yes, but still. Fighting isn&#039;t everything. There comes a point when fighting gets ridiculous, and takes away from the story. And it&#039;s told across this show, the games, and Manga books. Truly the largest story I have seen in an Anime. (Not counting Pokemon)<br />
<br />
Like I said, seeing .hack For the first time was chilling. When you are watching light comical Pokemon all the time, plus G&amp;reg; Rated Cartoons and you see something with that strong of thematic elements, you get chills. During one episode, when Aura, stabs Tsukasa, and who can forget, wasn&#039;t expecting that. And who can forget, &amp;quot;Data Drain.&amp;quot; This was a rare treat for me, because I hadn&#039;t (and still don&#039;t) seen that strong of Thematic Elements in Cartoons before. .hack is truly my Gate-Way Anime, to much better Anime.<br />
<br />
This is one of my favorite shows because it didn&#039;t go overboard with Violence, but it remained dark, and just unknown. It really bugs me when people give this show poor reviews. If it were just another type of it&#039;s Genre, fine. But I see this as a rather unique show. Not by it&#039;s Genre, by everything else. Stuff I had never seen before, prior to this. Imagine my reaction to Mimiru ;) Plus when they give it a low score just because it&#039;s full of dialog. Not everything has to be violent to be good! I hate it when Violence is so extreme, that I can&#039;t bare to watch it. (Inuyasha, Read or Die Wolf&#039;s Rain Cowboy Bebop) Because it&#039;s just distracting. Violence doesn&#039;t make for good story telling. But you don&#039;t see me giving those 0&#039;s or lower than 7, because of that. I gave Read or Die, a 8/10 over all. I can understand if you have ADHD, and you can&#039;t sit through it. Fine that&#039;s fact, doesn&#039;t mean you have to give it a low score. .hack//SIGN is more on thematic elements than combat, and more on mystery, than action. You want action, play the .hack GAMES, or watch something else You&#039;ll get your action. One of the best Anime I have ever seen.

    Generally, depending on the person, .hack//sign can be either extremely boring and a drag, or the best mix of story/sound/character that they have seen.  Personally, it qualifies as one of my most favorite animes.  When i first ventured into it, I wasn&#039;t expecting much.  After all, the games for ps2 sucked.  Soon, I found the character development and color of Tsubasa and her peers to be interesting.  True, at times, the droning music and dull colors may make people fall asleep, but this tone is what characterizes .hack.  It is meant to be in a dark environment, making it

    Sign was one of the first in the .hack // series that I watched, and I can say that I am completely disappointed. I already knew the problems of this anime and really thought I could ignore it, it used that proposal of the MC stuck in the online game, which makes me already excited, even because I like the style. Yes, let&#039;s go to the review!<br />
<br />
1 - Story [6/10] - As I said earlier, I like Sign&#039;s proposal, but I don&#039;t think it was done well. The worst point of this anime is the fact that the development is extremely slow, the dense dialogue

          <span style="display: none;" id="review371737">
        does not hold you at any time, while watching the anime I felt that the dialogues did not change much and were not interesting, the plot and much dragged and undeveloped. Believe me, I am not the type who likes to put action on everything like SAO, but this anime had an embarrassment in action fights to make it more fun to watch. Despite all this, the anime has a good ending and as I said, a good story proposal, the problem was actually the execution of the idea.<br />
<br />
2 - Art [6/10] - I could be content with the very lively art scenes of Sign (There are very few) and give a 7 or 8 note for the art, however, the thousands of scenes without animation, scenes of painting static made me take a step back and give a grade 6, which could simplify as: Something interesting to watch.<br />
<br />
3 - [8/10] - Yes! Sign deserves an 8 at BGM, honestly, the soundtrack is somehow very good! I can&#039;t say it was very well used, but it is still good. The opening was not a big deal when it comes to art, but the opening song is really fun.<br />
<br />
4 - Character [6/10] - In this category I can say that I am very rigorous, the protagonist is the center of all animes, no matter which one, the characters that integrate are what will give life to the work. The feeling that frustrated me with Sign was the fact that the protagonist is a pain in the ass! All the first 10 episodes of Sign boil down to how to be friendly with the protagonist, that really bothered me. He is too slow to make decisions and has dragged himself through the work like a poor guy who can&#039;t solve anything. Unfortunately, I didn&#039;t get to like him ... Besides, all the other characters are in fact &quot;acceptable&quot;, by the standard of characters, nothing too flashy.<br />
<br />
5 - Enjoyment [1/10] - Simply boring! As I said earlier, I don&#039;t mind not putting action in this type of anime, however, not the salvation for this anime. He was not amused at all. It failed to generate impact, failed to make it exciting, failed to make it interesting. Nothing! Only dialogue and dragged development. What a disappointment!<br />
<br />
Overall - The anime had a lot of problems, which made it boring. And I already say that it is impossible to ignore, unless you just want to put it on the list. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS WORK!

    Ah, .hack//SIGN. I might not be finished with it yet, but I am enjoying this series sooo much. It is my top priority right now, along with Sukisho and Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro, to watch this, I just love it that much.<br />
<br />
Story (9): This is basically about a video game called The World and the characters that play this game. It&#039;s focused around Tsukasa, a male character that can&#039;t log out of the game. There are some things that have happened in the beginning that I still don&#039;t understand, but it&#039;s things that I can overlook. I find the story to be quite original, because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review18223">
        I haven&#039;t seen anything like this yet. The first four episodes, I thought, &#039;Yeah, this is alright, I guess.&#039; Thankfully I ordered the next four episodes of it, because that was when it caught me. The whole thing just makes me wonder what&#039;s going to happen next.<br />
<br />
Art (8): Hmmm... I&#039;ve seen some points in the anime where the art just gets kind of ugly. Don&#039;t get me wrong, it&#039;s got good art, but it&#039;s not the greatest that I&#039;ve seen.<br />
<br />
Sound (9): I refuse to watch dubbed when subbed is an option, so I can&#039;t tell you much about the dubbed, but the subbed voices are, in my opinion, phenomenal. The voices fit perfectly with the characters. But there&#039;s one voice that I can&#039;t stand sometimes: Bear. I like the voice, but sometimes it gets annoying.<br />
<br />
Character (9): Oh, how I love some of these characters... I&#039;m a pretty big Tsukasa fan, because he just, in one word, pwns. XD Sora is one of my favorite characters, too, because he&#039;s just so funny at times! He&#039;s a jerk in a happy-go-lucky kind of way. (He makes me think of Sakamochi from Battle Royale at points.) All of these characters, with the acception of one: Subaru. I really don&#039;t like her. I don&#039;t really know why... There actually is some character development! It&#039;s amazing! You never see character development anymore...<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (9): This keeps my attention pretty well. There are some boring parts mixed in there with a bunch of talking with Subaru. But that usually stops pretty soon and goes back to the interesting stuff. I really do enjoy this anime.<br />
<br />
Overall (9): I could quite possibly give this a ten, but I don&#039;t feel like I would be being honest. I will very rarely give a ten. So a nine is a big compliment, along with the fact I&#039;m actually reviewing. .hack//SIGN is a great anime, but I feel like you will either love it or hate it. I happen to love it. It&#039;s interesting and actually surprises me at some points.<br />
<br />
So go watch it. Right now. ^-^

    &quot;Do you know the story of the Little Mermaid? The princess who reveived beautiful legs...but lost her voice so she could see the prince. But the prince married someone else...and the mermaid disappeared in bubbles of light.. She shouldn&#039;t have wished to leave the sea. Don&#039;t you think so?<br />
&quot;What comes to mind when you hear the phrase &quot;RPG anime&quot;? A generic shounen anime full of action/fighting with annoying kids and unrealistic teenagers characters taking the game so seriously in order to beat it or defeat some kind of boss or antagonist cliché, right?<br />
But have you ever seen: -An rpg anime with a lot of dialogue

          <span style="display: none;" id="review209380">
        and little action?<br />
-An anime role-playing game that focuses on solving a mystery rather than meaningless battles?<br />
-An anime role-playing game with realistic mature players?<br />
-An rpg anime in which characters grow outside of the game as well as within it?<br />
If you haven&#039;t, it means you haven&#039;t seen.hack/SIGN yet.<br />
But if we took out most of what a generic shounen anime has...what&#039;s left?<br />
<br />
The quotation you just read summarises the protagonist&#039;s situation.<br />
THIS IS NOT AT ALL LIKE SAO! So don&#039;t be fooled by the premise. Some may find hack/SIGN to be a slow and boring anime due to the lack of action and battles, but this actually allows for more time for story progression and character development through dialogue, emotions, and background information. Nothing here such as two players fighting each other for no reason, or &quot;Damsel in Distress&quot;, and no fanservice<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#039;s just a game, don&#039;t take it so seriously&quot;<br />
The majority of the main characters are mature with smart and realistic thinking, with the exception of Mimiru, who is young so she&#039;s a bit childish but not annoying; she&#039;s one of the few characters who provides the show with lighthearted moments to balance the serious depressing atmosphere, whereas Tsukasa, the focus of the story, is an unsocial, a cynic who doesn&#039;t trust people&#039;s intentions due to some traumatic experiences. They&#039;re both important in the story; every time you see Tsukasa interact with Mimiru, you&#039;ll notice how the loner Tsukasa develops slowly. But don&#039;t get me wrong: each major character in this anime will get a fair amount of screentime, which is unusual.<br />
<br />
The animation is not bad for its age; good character design and colour use, but the animations lack some frames at times, making it look too fast and funny; for example, at 13:30 in the first episode when Tsukasa gets up, but they&#039;re few.<br />
<br />
The music is very beautiful and fitting, made by the great composer Yuki Kajiura; I guess that&#039;s enough to say.<br />
  <br />
<br />
Overall, Hack Sign entertained me with an intriguing mystery that kept me watching, but it has one lazy horrible fuck-you ending. Hack/SIGN is not a successful anime for the reasons stated above; it is unpopular because it targets a small audience or is mistaken for another generic shounen anime, .hack/SIGN isn&#039;t your average mmorpg anime.

    Okay, I generally cannot watch anything Studio Beetrain produces, Most of the stuff they put out generally is uninteresting or boring, I watched both Noir and Madlax completely through, Noir was boring, but Madlax was fantastic. The .hack series is a major major letdown, I personally feel that a series like this has way too many complicated terms and sometimes stops people from trying to follow the story, Maybe the story was just ahead of it&#039;s time but I feel that it needed to be stronger and unfortunately it is very easy to get lost, but I wish the story was put into a language

    Well I almost don&#039;t know what to say about .hack//Sign, there was so much I loved about this show and then so much that made me want to claw out my eyes. Lets just dive into this.<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
.hack//Sign takes place in a virtual reality MMORPG called &quot;The World&quot;. Players in the world have different classes and play styles that they choose from and play. They all can play the game differently. We focus in on a player named Tsukasa who is trapped in The World, unable to log out. Tsukasa doesn&#039;t know why this is happening and neither does anyone else. The story progresses as Tsukasa

          <span style="display: none;" id="review120491">
        meets other players who all become interested and worried about why Tsukasa can&#039;t login. They embark on and EPIC journey to find out the mystery behind this... they don&#039;t seem to be in any rush what so ever because they seem to like sitting around talking....<br />
<br />
This has to be one of the WORST paced stories I have ever seen in anything ever. I get that the writers wanted to make the story and places feel real but this anime could have easily been around 14 episodes long, but it is dragged out way to much. It had such a great and interesting premise, but it just lacked any since of urgency. There were times were I could have easily just dropped the show but....<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS:<br />
The characters in .hack//Sign are very very well done and flushed out. Despite the horrible pacing of the shows story I didn&#039;t drop the show because the characters are just so good. They are all very real, I&#039;ve played MMORPGs before and I would have to say I have encountered basically someone who is like each and every character in .hack//Sign in a MMORPG. I found myself very attached to the characters because the way they interacted with each other felt very real. They all have their own reasons for wanting to help Tsukasa, and most of them felt very believable. <br />
<br />
SOUND:<br />
Yuki Kajiura... that is all. What an absolutely beautiful soundtrack! It made the moods of the show feel more passionate. It gave The World a feel of mystery, fantasy and scale. If I go on anymore I&#039;ll be rambling. I watched the English dub of the show (shut up you Elitest and Weeaboos) and I have to say I was fairly impressed. Brianne Siddall did an suburb job in portraying Tsukasa and Paul Mercier smooth fatherly voice was a perfect fit for Bear. Every time Mimiru talked I thought that Rei Ayanami was on crack LAWL (share same VA) A solid performance from all the English voice actors. Oh and I&#039;m sure all the Japanese VA&#039;s made reading the subtitles just &quot;grand&quot; For as much talking as this show has you owe it to your eyes to watch .hack//Sign in English plus it was a good dub.<br />
<br />
ART:<br />
The art in .hack//Sign was kinda meh. They made the world look nice, but nothing really stood out to me as WOW THAT LOOKS AWESOME. Same thing on the animation side, since they don&#039;t move much it was hard to really judge the animation quality, but for the few times there were &quot;action scenes&quot; it looked almost out of place. Not much else to say, it works but nothing really to brag or complain about.<br />
<br />
ENDING:<br />
I just had to put this in don&#039;t worry there are no spoilers. The ending of .hack//Sign ranks as the all time worst ending to any anime that I have ever watched. It just sucked and offered no closure at all. The story was just building up and up and up and the it ended in kind of a &quot;LAWL NOPE CTRL ALT DEL&quot; fashion.... I don&#039;t care if it&#039;s a lead into the games THE ENDING IS PARAMOUNT!! So yea that pissed me off. Don&#039;t get me started on the filler OVAs, an anime should be able to stand on its own without having to have OVAs or movies fill in the holes.<br />
<br />
OVERALL:<br />
Despite my hatred for the ending and the pacing of the show .hack//Sign was actually rather enjoyable. The story does pick up in the last 6 episodes and there is enough interesting aspects of the show to consider watching it. The music is great, the voice actor spot on and it is easy to relate to the characters. I enjoyed .hack//Sign but honestly to someone who wants something fast paced and action heavy (I.e SAO people who want to see more of SAO like stuff) I would pass on .hack//Sign. It&#039;s a great watch for someone who is wanting really a character drama and for those people, you will enjoy .hack//Sign.

    Before I start off with this review I&#039;d like to point out that I haven&#039;t played any of the .hack video games, so this view is directly from a person that has no background information from the video games.<br />
<br />
      This .hack is definitely different but similar in it&#039;s own accord compared to the other .hack series. The story is very plain and boring when read on paper, but really think about it, if you try to imagine the events happening in the real world it would be pretty messed up and interesting, the one thing I really liked about this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review38062">
        series is the fact that they put more emphasis on the players themselves rather than the characters inside the video game, the main character Tsukasa is &quot;stuck&quot; in the game, he can&#039;t seem to log out (although in the real world tsukasa is actually a female playing a male character in the video game).<br />
<br />
     The story gets more complicated as the number of episodes escalates but it mostly still revolves around the main character tsukasa, weird events start happening and the item called &quot;Key of the twilight&quot; is mentioned, which is I&#039;m guessing the same item that they were looking for in .hack//roots, with that being said these events happened before roots, since in this one he obtained the key of the twilight while in roots it&#039;s considered to be a myth. Now the amount of episodes that Sign has is quite understandable, 26 isn&#039;t too much and too little either. Overall the story could use some more excitement considering there&#039;s almost no action in the whole series, the most you&#039;ll ever see is them wielding out their weapons and threatening each other to fight, but other than that it&#039;s usually just pure talking.<br />
<br />
     The art of the anime is pretty straightforward, nothing too fancy or too unique about it, this was made in 2002 so don&#039;t expect much about they way they look, for those that are really picky with the art and animation, all I can say is that for you guys, it&#039;s bearable to watch and I&#039;m sure that&#039;s convincing enough for you guys to check the anime out.<br />
<br />
     Now the final thing I want to talk about are the characters, tsukasa&#039;s design is very very plain, and I&#039;m completely comparing him/her to Haseo on this one because the way Tsukasa looks makes you want to go to sleep, I understand that his character in the video game isn&#039;t really for close combat or anything flashy like that but come on now... he&#039;s the main character can&#039;t you make him a bit cooler looking? The character that really intrigued me the most is Mimiru, the heavy blade character that befriends Tsukasa and Bear and is helping him/her trying to figure as to why Tsukasa can&#039;t log out of the game. What makes her so interesting is that she&#039;s the lead female character of the anime and yet she takes on the role as to what the male is supposed to be, which is the buffed up warrior role, and I think she plays her character quite well to a point where you know she has the ability to protect tsukasa and at the same time have that soft female side from her, (and plus I think I can relate to her because I&#039;ve always liked warrior classes from mmorpgs)<br />
<br />
Overall .hack//SIGN isn&#039;t such a bad anime, I&#039;ve seen way worse ones out there and it&#039;s clearly safe to say that you really need to play the video games if you want to experience the true feeling of getting into this anime because clearly from my perspective as a person who hasn&#039;t played the video games you can really see from the scores I&#039;ve given this.<br />
<br />
cheers.

    .hack//Sign was a prequel to the .hack// video game series made by CyberConnect2 and released by Bandai about a decade ago. If I&#039;m right, .hack//Sign and the rest of the series garnered a bit of popularity back in the day, though nowadays they are a bit aged and are becoming more and more forgotten. Despite being a prequel, .hack//Sign can work as a standalone product for the most part, and as such it can even be looked at on its own.<br />
<br />
.hack//Sign is a slow moving anime, mostly focusing on character relationships and for the most part not showing much sign of a story for the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review131559">
        first 10 episodes. In that time, we learn that Tsukasa, the main protagonist, is for some reason or another stuck in the game known as The World, and his being stuck there may have some relation with a legendary hidden item within The World called the Key of the Twilight. Other characters want to help Tsukasa leave the game and go searching for this hiden item. As a mystery anime, .hack//Sign throws out a lot of red herrings. It tries to get the viewer to latch onto ideas that serve little relevance to the main plot. And that&#039;s one of the problems: Almost all of the dialogue in .hack//Sign is unimportant and uninteresting, and it does little to move the plot forward. Other characters constantly find themselves trying to figure out what&#039;s going on with Tsukasa. They want to help him, but each episode just leads to more false information or no actual progress in helping him. It waters down the story and cuts the enjoyment of this anime down by a lot. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I like .hack//Sign, but it can be pretty hard for many anime viewers to watch I suspect due to all of the pointless talking. Its unnecessary, and the show could have been cut down considerably in the number of episodes and still tell the main storyline. The main story itself though is told in a way that still leaves the viewer interested. What is the Key of the Twilight? Will Tsukasa and the others find it? Why is Tsukasa stuck in the game, and why does he keep running away? What are all these flashbacks to the real world? Speaking of that, Tsukasa is worse than Shinji from Evangelion when it comes to running away and moving the story forward. It seems like Tsukasa being stuck in the game is a plot device, as its the other characters that actually work towards solving the mysteries and moving things forward for a good while. The story IS interesting however, and the setting of The World grants it a lot of mysteries, some of which admittedly go unsolved within this anime. You want to know what&#039;s going on. Its just that the execution of the story is problematic, and while the story is interesting, the story is also relatively short and simple. Its something simple told in a rather complex and somewhat realistic, somewhat dumb way.<br />
<br />
The characters of the anime are a mixed bag. Most of the characters come off as dull and near lifeless, and the constant talking references their personal lives. While this may seem like good characterization, since the characters start off initially bland, the viewer may already be uninterested in learning about the individual characters lives. Added to this, most of the information about their personal lives that is mentioned in the anime, which takes up much more of the anime than it should, is really pointless and uninteresting. Do we really need an episode dedicated to a character&#039;s dislike of lettuce? That said, it is a unique thing that it goes so in depth on the characters, its just that it wasn&#039;t well executed in .hack//Sign. Still, none of the characters are hateable, and Tsukasa himself and a girl by the name of Lady Subaru are legitimately interesting. Tsukasa himself from the very beginning sparks interest in the viewer. Why does he keep running away, and why is he so unwilling to be social? .hack//Sign uses Tsukasa to explore one of the main themes of the show: Escapism. The whole show focuses heavily on the concept of escapism and how it affects the one running away and those around said person. (themes of escapism also show in how the real world is depicted)Tsukasa may be another Shinji, but he is his own character in just how far the show takes it. Then characters like Sora, a silly yet powerful player always searching for new information help keep things fun. And while it takes a long while for him to seem interesting, Silver Knight, a lawful knight who enforces the rules of the game, becomes interesting after some added characterization late in the series. But that&#039;s one of the problems with the show: It takes too long to move the story forward, and it takes too long to make most of the characters worth caring for. Only Tsukasa and Lady Subaru (who shows great interest in Tsukasa&#039;s situation) really start out interesting.<br />
<br />
The art itself in the series is pretty to look at, though admittedly sometimes a bit simplistic, especially in backgrounds and fields. The age of the show shows, but nice character designs from the same person who did the character designs in Neon Genesis Evangelion make the characters interesting to look at. Occasionally close ups give added detail to the artwork, making it extremely impressive to look at, even to the point of making this show a great source for desktop backgrounds. The animation however, is usually pretty minimal. In the Monogatari Series, characters talk to each other for long periods of time, often with lots of crazy and silly yet good animation being shown on screen to keep things interesting. That isn&#039;t the case here. Most of the time, the animation is minimal and very boring. Occasionally however, when its really important, the animation takes vast improvements by leaps and bounds and everything moves really smoothly, however this is rare and is used for the most important scenes.<br />
<br />
Now the sound is what I call a 10/10. The music was done by Yuki Kaijura, known for such soundtracks as the Sword Art Online soundtrack and the soundtrack to Puella Magi Madoka Magica. And while those soundtracks were good, .hack//Sign has by far some of the best music in any anime period, and the music outshines the music in SAO by a long shot and PMMM somewhat. Much of the music is comprised of what sounds like a violin or something similar, an acoustic guitar, an electric guitar, and pretty English vocals with lyrics often somewhat fitting to the storyline of the show. Its often very relaxing to listen to. Tracks like &quot;The World&quot; and &quot;Key of the Twilight&quot; really shine. I don&#039;t know how good the acting is in the Japanese voice track, but the English dub is pretty mediocre. Nothing too cringe-worthy or bad, but with  the writing in this show, which is somewhat poorly written, things sound really weird being heard. It&#039;d probably sound less weird reading it than listening to it. The acting itself is pretty mediocre too. Tsukasa sounds fine, Subaru&#039;s voice seems to fit the character well and Mimiru does a fine job, however the rest of the cast is varied. Some of which usually are entertaining to listen to while others are boring and lifeless or downright have bad acting.<br />
<br />
Overall, .hack//Sign is a show that really shines in its music and artwork. It has plenty of character development if you&#039;re patient enough to wait for it, however ultimately that&#039;s what this show requires: Patience. If you don&#039;t like slow moving shows with lots of dialogue, stay away. If you&#039;re here because you liked Sword Art Online and wanted another MMO anime, just know that this show is VERY, VERY different. Ultimately I don&#039;t think I could recomend this anime for most anime fans. If you&#039;re patient or are a .hack// fan, go for it. Otherwise, .hack//Sign isn&#039;t the anime for you. Don&#039;t let that deter you from watching other .hack// anime however. Not all of them are the same. If you want .hack// but want something a bit faster paced and more fun, then .hack//Quantum or .hack//The Movie might be better suited for you.

    If you like a slow paced story, focussing on the characters with thoroughly immersive music, you will greatly enjoy this anime. If you like fast paced stories with action scenes led forward by the storyline, this anime is not for you. For those whom the rest of this review is not yet redundant, feel free to read on.<br />
<br />
The story is well crafted; while it appears the story is light-hearted, underneath it all it is quite dark. The theme of escapism runs throughout the series, and this is synced well with the aesthetics. The World is colourful and diverse, with canal based cities, green cliff-tops above

          <span style="display: none;" id="review45189">
        the clouds, deserts and snowy mountains to name a few, as well as the powerful music. You never forget it&#039;s just a game though, with the chaos gates and memories sounding like they were being retold through a headset being 2 very MMO effects used. The real world on the other hand, is black and white, crackly and silent, with lines told in text. It emphasises how enticing The World is compared to real life. <br />
<br />
The characters&#039; stories are told fairly uniquely, in that there are two stories, for the in-game character and their real-life counterpart. These personalities are often different, and it underlines the theme of escapism. Interpersonal relationships do well from this as well, as characters can interact with not only other in-game characters, but also their real-life character. This complexity makes the character&#039;s feel realistic, and having characters from various walks of life reinforces another virtue of MMos: that people, no matter their age or gender or social status, can interact as equals. <br />
<br />
<br />
The music is by Yuki Kajiura. Her music is always outstanding, but it is either forced upon you, interfering with the story and making the music and the story very disjointed, or is used to immerse the viewer in the story, enhancing the experience. I can happily say this is definitely the latter, which is impressive considering how many of the soundtracks are sung in English; in fact, the songs are both the best of the soundtrack, and the most immersive.<br />
<br />
I came looking to burn through the anime and add the soundtrack to my music player; instead .Hack//Sign sat me down and showed me a masterpiece; this is definitely a must-watch for any who can watch a slowly unfolding story. It plays out like a spiral; you think it is unchanging, moving forward, but without realising the story is getting deeper and darker with each episode you go through. It does have some flaws; the ending was so fast I thought I missed an episode, and the camera does sometimes stay on characters for a long time, with little animation going on, but these are nit-pickings that don&#039;t have any real effect on my enjoyment of the anime.
