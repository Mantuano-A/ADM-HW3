    I used to be such a fangirl for this series. Looking back, I can still see why I loved it so much, but I feel like I evaluate it with a more objective perspective now.<br />
<br />
STORY - I would venture to say that Gravitation was probably one of the first of its kind. Certainly, this was the title that opened the floodgates for hundreds of other shounen-ai titles at the turn of the century. Sure, if you pick through the music and ignore the gay pairing, you leave yourself with a simple, old-fashioned love story about one person pursuing another&#039;s love while a troubled past stands

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5316">
        between them. Nothing new there at all. But Murakami&#039;s decision to intermix a very strong musical plotline together with the core romance was a very smart move indeed and probably one of the main reasons I took to this series so readily. I really appreciated the fact that Shuichi&#039;s attention was split fifty-fifty between his career and Yuki -- this balance made things interesting in so many different ways because there were times when Shuichi&#039;s two goals seemed to go against each other and he had to decide which was more important. The fact that he sometimes had trouble putting one above the other made him easy to sympathize with, and it was refreshing to see that the romance wasn&#039;t always the absolute central point of the series. <br />
<br />
I also really enjoyed the insight into the music industry, though much of it was certainly exaggerated. It&#039;s amusing in a way how much I shirk away from caring about the rival bands and scandals for musicians in real life, but Gravitation got my attention anyway. The drama was good, and I suppose you grow to care about these characters much more than those in reality. Unfortunately, Yuki&#039;s deep, dark past could be considered the most clich&amp;eacute; aspect of the entire series, and even in my fangirl days, I was never really impressed by it. Still, within the thirteen episode series, the subject is skirted around constantly and details always remain a bit fuzzy around the edges. I suppose it&#039;s partially because much of the series is very comedic and the horribly tragedies of the past are only explored enough for the present to make sense. It works alright enough, but it certainly isn&#039;t anything amazing.<br />
<br />
All in all, Gravitation&#039;s story is a good, fun twist on a simple, old love story. While not perfect by any means, it&#039;s still both a brilliant comedy and a touching romance, and there&#039;s enough little surprises to keep you excited for the entirety of its run!<br />
<br />
CHARACTER - I don&#039;t think there was a single bad character in this entire series. Each and every one of them had some sort of role to fill and had their moment in the spotlight. Though there were a few classic archetypes like Yuki, the dark and mysterious one, and Hiro, the best friend, somehow the little quirks in their personalities made them seem a little less typical. Yuki especially, armed with his tragic past, was an interesting character to follow because he himself admits that he doesn&#039;t understand himself. In retrospect, his probably wasn&#039;t the most accurate or the most convincing account of trauma and psychological health problems in the world, it works well enough for the story&#039;s purposes.<br />
<br />
Shuichi was a fun protagonist, considering he was also one of the series&#039; primary sources of comedy relief (in the first episode, he was late for a meeting because he had to go save a turtle being harassed by a bunch of kids, you know). Spastic and crazy most of the time, he&#039;s moments of seriousness almost seem random, but where Yuki&#039;s past only worked well enough, Shuichi&#039;s dynamic personality actually worked very well. It&#039;s clear that his love started off as simple infatuation and that he had to deal with mostly un-reciprocated feelings for several episodes; it was thus intriguing to watch how his generally happy personality dealt with the chaos, turmoil, and heavy uncertainty that came with the relationship he found himself in. It was also nice to see a character that wasn&#039;t always sure of himself and his feelings -- even though it was easy for the audience to tell how he felt, Shuichi still questioned himself and the &amp;quot;purity&amp;quot; of his love wasn&#039;t cheapened by the absolute certainty other characters sometimes have.<br />
<br />
Pretty much all of the other characters are also worth mentioning, but I&#039;ll try to be more brief for the rest of them: Ryuuichi and Tohma are probably the most interesting characters aside from our main boys. Both front one image of themselves while maintaining ulterior motives that are both understandable, easy to sympathize with, and realistic enough, making them more whole as characters. K and Sakano, both wonderfully unique and quirky, aid Shuichi in the comic relief, and they do it oh so very well. Tachi, and to a lesser extent, the rest of ASK, are probably the flatest characters in the entire series, which is rather impressive, I think, because they&#039;re not that unbelievable of characters despite that. And though Gravi is a very obviously bishounen-centric series, the three whole female characters we get are all fairly respectable. Mika, Noriko, and Ayaka all serve their roles well and don&#039;t bring down their sex! Power to that.<br />
<br />
ART &amp;amp; ANIMATION - The animation was more or less average. It wasn&#039;t outstandingly exceptional, but nor was it terrible and poorly done. Some introductory scenes are made to look like a live action piece, which made things interesting, but again it isn&#039;t anything eye-popping. The bright and flashing lights during performances were good and realistic; some of the backgrounds throughout the series also looked quite nice because of similar effects. Though the characters are drawn in a pretty generic style for the most part, super deformed chibi people jump in quite often for emphasis and comical effect. The &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; characters don&#039;t much resemble Murakami&#039;s original style, but thats probably partially due to the fact that Murakami&#039;s style changed dramatically during the course of her twelve volume manga. The chibi style on the other hand, is pretty easy to recognize as Murakami&#039;s own.<br />
<br />
MUSIC - Gravitation is everything about the music. The music in this series is what makes it complete, and I wouldn&#039;t have it any other way. From beginning to end, Gravitation is filled with perfectly appropriate background music, no matter how long or short the clip or scene is. Many a times, insert songs are rehashed as soft instrumental and piano versions, helping to bring in familiar themes for emphasis and emotion.<br />
<br />
J-rock artist Kinya Kotani sings all of Bad Luck&#039;s music in the series. Though his music has changed significantly since his work in Gravitation, his work at the time suited Bad Luck very well because Kinya&#039;s personality was near identical to Shuichi&#039;s. Seriously! Someone like that actually did exist in real life! &amp;quot;The Rage Beat,&amp;quot; Bad Luck&#039;s main insert song is incredibly upbeat and energetic, perfect for pumping up the audience; it&#039;s also very inspiring to listen to and helps gear everyone up for some exciting confrontation. &amp;quot;The Rage Beat&amp;quot; actually plays once an episode for like the first five episodes, but you don&#039;t really tire of it. If anything, you get more excited for it every time. &amp;quot;Blind Game Again,&amp;quot; the band&#039;s other insert song is equally energetic, though a bit more serious sounding, which fits very well with when its used. Nittlegrasper&#039;s only song in the series is &amp;quot;Sleepless Beauty,&amp;quot; which is performed by K.ITO + D.K. (Kenichi Ito and Daisuke Kuroda) It&#039;s a breathtaking song and also suits the band very well. <br />
<br />
Funnily enough, Murakami obviously got her inspiration for some of the characters in Gravitation from real life groups. Nittlegrasper, a legend in the series, is comprised of Tohma Seguchi (keyboardist), Noriko Urai (keyboardist), and Ryuichi Sakuma (vocalist and lyricist). Nittlegrasper disbands with Ryuichi leaving to pursue a solo career in America, and Tohma becoming the president of NG, a producing company. Now, Icemen was a real life j-rock band, though they certainly weren&#039;t as famous as Nittlegrasper, they performed &amp;quot;Shining Collection,&amp;quot; Nittlegrasper&#039;s song in the Gravitation OVA. Icemen is comprised of Daisuke Asakura (keyboardist), Kenichi Ito (guitarrist), and Michihiro Kuroda (vocalist). Icemen disbanded in 2000 with Kuroda leaving to pursue a solo career in America, and Daisuke is now the very capable producer of many j-pop/j-rock bands. Including Kinya Kotani. And K.ITO + D.K. And Yousuke Sakanoue (who did Gravi&#039;s OP theme). NG produces all the music for Bad Luck. DA produces all the music for Kinya. Well, what a coincidence! The change that Murakami made was adding in Noriko, the purple-haired keyboardist in place of Kenichi, the red-haired guitarrist. But wait, Hiro, of Bad Luck, is a red-haired guitarrist! And they&#039;re both on white guitars no less! Guess she was trying to make it less obvious where she got her inspiration.<br />
<br />
Really though. The music in Gravitation is fantastic. The OP theme is one of the few that I actually sat through every single time because I was so enthralled by its energy. The ED theme is similarly entrancing, though with a slower, calmer melody. Good stuff guys, seriously.<br />
<br />
DUBBING &amp;amp; VOCALS - The original voices in Gravitation are exceptional. A lot of renowned voice actors worked in this anime, and they all live up to their name. Seki Tomokazu works Shuichi&#039;s personality beautifully. His voice is energetic and strong when need be, and softer, more quiet and scared when need be; the emotion that rings in Shuichi&#039;s voice is incredibly convincing. Shuichi&#039;s singing voice is that of Kinya Kotani, and I&#039;ve already rambled about that. Ryuichi&#039;s voice has a similar effect with emotion. Yamaguchi Kappei has played a lot of famous leads, including Ranma and Inuyasha, and though he doesn&#039;t play lead in this anime, his character is nonetheless quite essential and a good voice never hurt in that. And since Ryuichi&#039;s character changes so quickly from second to second, it&#039;s amazing that he sounds so good. His normal, chibi, cute character is fitted with a perfectly adorable and simply lovable voice. It really does sound as if a child is running around and squealing about the Monster Gao and cars going zoom. Then, quickly, in the blink of an eye, Ryuichi will be serious and his voice suiting him just as wonderfully. <br />
<br />
My favorite voice in the series is neither singer however, but rather, Tohma Seguchi, for he is voiced by Orikasa Ai. You can&#039;t really can&#039;t tell Tohma was voiced by a woman unless you already knew. She does a phenomenal job with it, making Tohma a strong and eeriely convincing character. He can show support and kindness when he wants to and give calm and simply chilling orders when he&#039;s irked. Tohma means buisness; he gets what he wants. And that&#039;s made perfectly clear. Orikasa Ai is also the voice of Ryoko from Tenchi Muyo!, and not to mention Quatre from Gundam Wing, who looks freakishly like Tohma&#039;s twin.<br />
<br />
Gravitation has been licensed and dubbed in the US by The Right Stuf International. Because TRSI hasn&#039;t worked with that many series, the names on the cast list are unfamiliar and unimpressive for the most part. I bought the first two DVDs when they came out and thus saw the first six episodes dubbed. I couldn&#039;t do it anymore after that. As a fan of the series, I realize I was probably (and still am) a bit purist about it, but I usually consider myself to have a pretty high tolerance for bad dubs (I made it through ten episodes of the 4Kids One Piece, after all). Gravitation&#039;s dub was just that awful. All of the characters sounded flat and unemotional, and they all sounded like they had the same voice actor. Shuichi wasn&#039;t nearly as energetic as he should have been. It was simply bizarre hearing Tohma with a very generic man&#039;s voice. Yuki&#039;s voice was probably the most forgivable, but that&#039;s probably because his archetype was the easiest to type cast for. One of these days, I might go back and watch those DVDs again for a second impression, but when the original is just so damn good, I don&#039;t know why I would. (My impression of the dub does not affect my score in the &amp;quot;sound&amp;quot; category of this review.)<br />
<br />
OVERALL - Gravitation really is a piece of work. It can go from absolutely hilarious to troublingly dark (and vice versa) in three seconds flat. You get two stories at once, two missions, two goals. You seem to jump back and forth from one to the other, but in truth, they&#039;re both intertwined through relationships and an mysterious history, making things quite intriguing. Gravitation is worth a watch, even if you aren&#039;t particularly fond of shounen-ai. In the end, it&#039;s a romantic comedy with a dark twist, and I&#039;ve known a good number of people who don&#039;t care for the genre at all to have fallen in love with this series because the boy&#039;s love isn&#039;t the point. (Just a plus.) <br />

    The truth of the matter is that most shounen ai anime just isn&#039;t good; be it because of the crappy story, obvious fan service or bad direction. However, Gravitation doesn’t just pull it off as a shounen ai but as an anime in general. <br />
<br />
The story follows Shuichi Shindou, a 19 year old vocalist trying to make it big in the music industry and Eiri Yuki, a young, cool and cold romance novelist and pretty much revolves around the couple’s careers, love life and past. Nothing complicated or confusing neither is it plot less or pointless. The series is short, only 13 episodes long but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19724">
        every episode is filled with quality; it’s well paced, never did it ever feel even slightly slow or boring. It&#039;s simply entertaining which is what an anime should be!<br />
<br />
Shuichi is a generic uke; he’s loud, cute, innocent, has a feminine body (which he uses for his failed plans) and is quite open about his love towards Eiri yet he’s a loveable character. I don’t usually like characters with this sort of annoying personality but with Shuichi he grows on you, maybe because its quite nice to have such an energetic character as the main lead. <br />
Eiri is….a cool guy, look wise and personality wise. He’s the classic “Tall, dark and handsome” character fan girls scream over. When I said before it revolves around the couples past, its actually his past that it’s focused on (I mean, seriously, you can’t expect Shuichi to have a dark past now could you?) <br />
Other characters include Hiro and Suguru who are the other members of Shuichi’s band ‘Bad Luck‘, Mr K their manager, Mr Sakano their producer, Tohma Seguchi their boss, Eiri’s brother in law and a member of Shuichi’s favourite band ‘Nittle Grasper’ etc. The cast of Gravitation is likeable, they’re mostly used for comic relief and for a 13 episode show they all carry a decent amount of distinct characteristics. Tohma reminds me of some petite pretty boy gangster though, the way he handles certain situations and is one of the more serious characters. <br />
<br />
Here comes the music. A very important part in any anime, even more so in this one since it’s a show all about music. The music and themes in this are just simply fun and personally I quite liked them - the opening and other songs the band sung had some techno in it which made the songs really funky, which I enjoyed since I don’t really listen to techno. The piano themes used when there’s a ‘heart-warming moment’ or whatever got me every time (in a good way) and the ending is used to create a cliff-hanger moment at the end of each episode. <br />
However, it sort of annoyed me that they recycle the same song/scenes every time they showed Bad Luck singing - only a couple of other times did they use new footage or songs. The music aren’t masterpieces but it’s a great listen. <br />
<br />
If outfits come under art, I would down rate the art because the performing outfits that Shuichi and Ryuichi wore are HORRIBLE. They look like some bad cop out from the 80’s which I don’t understand how it managed to find its way into this show since Gravitation came out in 2000. Then again, I don’t live in Japan so I don’t really know how singers dress there, though I’m pretty sure no singer in their right mind would dress like that.  Other than that little critique the art was fine. The cover shown in the summary pretty much tells you what the art is like - bright, pretty and cute, so not much more I can really discuss on that.  <br />
<br />
In my opinion, Gravitation is one the best shounen ai out there to date. The only reason why I say “one of” is simply because I haven’t watched all the shounen ai out there, but even so it’s still up there because it also does well as an anime. It’s well funny, throughout the series I had had many good laughs. There are extremely lame and stupid moments (e.g. Shuichi dressing in dog costume) that had made me cringe but I guess that’s just part of the course. There are also shocking pause-the-screen-to-take-in-what-just-happened moments which either puts a huge grin on my face or make me look completely dumbfounded. <br />
<br />
The music industry aspect is quirky, serving much humorous content with the sheer craziness of it all and does make the audience doubt the music industry of today if that’s how it’s really run. And even though it is shounen ai, don’t be completely put off by it - I guess if you ever want to explore this genre then Gravitation is a good or perhaps the only place to start.

    It’s been a while since I watched this anime, and I know that I don’t want to see it ever again. Back then, I was looking for some yaoi or shounen-ai to watch. Going through various forums and reviews I found Gravitation, downloaded it and started watching.<br />
<br />
With every episode I hoped that the next one will be better, but unfortunately they all were at the same low level. An over-emotional immature kid who’s able to sing only one or two sings through all the 13 episodes, with huge eyes and pink hair, dressed in some funny coat and shorts. Thanks, I’ll pass. <br />
<br />
Instead of funny,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14078">
        try pathetic. I don’t remember laughing much when I watched it. And when I did it was more of the silly actions of the main character than of the actual humor. The art isn’t stunning either, the music even worse.<br />
<br />
There were, of course, some scenes that I liked, but not many of them. The only character I could like was Yuki Eiri because of his outwardly cold and indifferent demeanor. But even that wasn’t good enough to begin liking the anime in the slightest. I survived to the end of it and was glad to be able to finally remove it from my HD. Well, the last episodes I watched thinking ‘only 4 (or less) left, if I survived till now, I can finish it as well’.<br />
<br />
And ever since I watched it I’m wondering how it’s possible that so many people worship it. I cannot understand it. For me, it was probably the worst anime I’ve ever seen.

    5 WORDS OR LESS REVIEW: Cute, funny and good enough.<br />
<br />
Like your typical shonen-ai anime, Gravitation focuses more on boy-boy love and thus the other plot elements are forgotten. Other than being a shonen-ai anime, Gravitation was supposed to be an anime about making it big in the music industry. Sometimes, I think that aspect is overlooked. I think if the shonen-ai and music making aspects were balanced, Gravitation would have been better.<br />
<br />
The cast, as expected, were full of gorgeous male characters. My favorites would be Hiro and Yuki &amp;ndash; I like the mysterious, tall and handsome types. Shuichi was okay, he gets on my nerves

          <span style="display: none;" id="review817">
        sometimes, but he&amp;rsquo;s really cute when he&amp;rsquo;s chibi-fied. His choice of outfits is questionable though &amp;ndash; his normal clothes are okay, but the banana suit and the school girl uniform was too much. Why can&amp;rsquo;t he be more like Ryuichi who&amp;rsquo;s cute all the time?<br />
<br />
I&amp;rsquo;m always impressed when a female seiyuu is assigned to a male character. Takimoto Fujiko (Fujisaki Suguru) and Ai Orikasa (Seguchi Tohma) were good in portraying male characters, however I like Takimoto Fujiko more because when I first heard Seguchi Tohma&amp;rsquo;s voice, I knew his seiyuu was female right away. Ai Orikasa&amp;rsquo;s voice was too high pitched and mellow, which is unfitting for a male president of a record company. Of course, I can&amp;rsquo;t forget to note Tomokazu Seki, who was Shuichi&amp;rsquo;s seiyu. He&amp;rsquo;s my favorite no matter what roles he picks.<br />
<br />
Visuals for gravitation were interesting. I like how they incorporated real images with the animation &amp;ndash; it makes it look different. However, when it&amp;rsquo;s just pure animation, I have to say I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan. The drawings were inconsistent, and needed work. Yuki&amp;rsquo;s face changes almost every episode. Same goes for the coloring. There were times when there were stills and repeated scenes were used. That&amp;rsquo;s just being lazy for me. The visuals did get better towards the end.<br />
<br />
As for the music, the OP reminded me a lot of Pet Shop Boys songs. I only heard a few of their songs (I wasn&amp;rsquo;t born yet when they first started), but when I first watched Gravitation I immediately thought of the Pet Shop Boys. I like the ED better, it&amp;rsquo;s quite catchy but I kinda wish a girl sang it. It is a shonen-ai anime after all. There&amp;rsquo;s also the insert songs, which were nice, but again &amp;ndash; Pet Shop Boys.<br />
<br />
It could have been better, not that I&amp;rsquo;m saying it&amp;rsquo;s bad &amp;ndash; but it needed some improvement. For me, Gravitation&amp;rsquo;s strengths lies in its comedy, chibi-cuteness, Tomokazu Seki and of course, the shonen-ai.

    Second Review. (I think I might make this a hobby)<br />
<br />
To be honest I thought the anime of Gravitation, was just poor. It was obnoxious, and way too irritating. I barely got through it. Thirteen episodes was more than enough for me. And although most of my friends tell me to watch the OVA’s.. I have no motivation to do so, that is how bad the anime was.<br />
<br />
The characters had very little development, they stayed the same throughout. For example the main one remained obnoxious and kind of naïve. It’s a very typical shounen-ai. Cheesy, with no twists, and absolutely no real plot development. Most fans

          <span style="display: none;" id="review20020">
        of this anime are indeed female, but only because it is classified as cute. <br />
<br />
Guess when I’m looking for shounen-ai, or more so yaoi. I should look for more serious things, and less cute. A tease and a waste of time. As harsh as that sounds. :( <br />
<br />
The only thing I can really commend it for, is the music. It has decent music, and voice overs.<br />
<br />
<br />

    General, this is my second favourite anime, really good indeed. I don&#039;t think that many boys would like it though, because I suppose only we, girls, love shounen-ai :P I could be wrong of course. The story is very good and original in my opinion, it shows how someone who is really in love could fight with all  prejudices (and there are trurly many of them). The art is really one of my favourte tipes, though there are a bit too more chibis, but I like it :) Since you&#039;re watching about musical groups in this anime too, the sound is outstanding, really good

          <span style="display: none;" id="review741">
        and made with effort. The charactres are most of all boys, but very cute ones ;) They are really good made especially when you know that half of the manga is cut if not more. I&#039;ve really enjoyed watching this anime so I recommend it to all of you, especially girls ;P<br />

    There is little that can be said of Gravitation that has not already been said. Gravitation has been the &amp;quot;shounen ai&amp;quot; flagship for many years, and it is well deserved. While other anime series lose themselves with complex storylines and characters, this one dazzles you with it&#039;s over-simplicity.<br />
<br />
The story of a boy who longs to be a famous singer [who hasn&#039;t dreamt of that?] and equally longs to be loved by the person of his dreams [and who has not dreamt of this either?] the story barely deviates from this idea and therefore lacks the need to embellish or exaggerate the overall theme. If Jem

          <span style="display: none;" id="review8683">
        &amp;amp; the Holograms were an all boy cast, this would be the result. Tho primarily a romance, there is a little sprinkling of action, drama and even mystery in there....not to mention comedy. This series is a welcome reprieve from the Myth and Mecha genre.<br />
<br />
Animation and Character design again, are not deviating from the show&#039;s simplified formula using traditional *bish* design. Wherefore making it quite easy for each character to shift gender with just a few tweaks, primarily lead character, the pink-haired Shuichi, who frequently dons what one would normally designate as female clothing. And there are others, who also seem to flirt with blurring gender lines. The movements were standard anime, and there are several scenes that are looped, which becomes repetitive, this show&#039;s only notable flaw.<br />
<br />
What&#039;s a music show without music? The creators of this series provided us with 4 or 5 tracks which were outstanding. The first concert song by Shuichi/Bad Luck was phenomenal, couple this with the fact he sings this with his long time idol will make even the most skeptical anime watcher&#039;s heart melt. Opening and closing theme songs were toe-tapping good times as well. I got the whole soundtrack! It&#039;s really good.<br />
<br />
As I&#039;ve earlier, with the exception of it being one of the first real BL animes to make it big, there is nothing new about this series with regard to art, theme, or story and will not satisfy your needs if you are craving visual or intellectual stimulation. No, I think the true magic of this series is how it makes you feel inside with it&#039;s simplicity.

    To fans of shounen-ai/ yaoi anime, Gravitation was the anime that helped popularize the launch of later &quot;boys love&quot; TV anime titles that would pop up now and then like Junjou Romantica and Loveless. However beyond the latter and Antique Bakery, much of my exposure to &quot;boys love&quot; titles have consisted of subpar and angsty melodramas focused on &quot;dominant&quot; and &quot;submissive&quot; types of attractive male characters that made me not survive any further than the first few minutes of a show&#039;s first episode. Sadly, Gravitation follows this same mold to a great extent in its focus on Eiri and Shuiichi&#039;s developing relationship with each following

          <span style="display: none;" id="review60097">
        the dominant and submissive roles respectively. Both characters got quite obnoxious with their personalities for me with Eiri&#039;s barely expressive demeanor and Shuuichi&#039;s energetic and intrusive behavior. The approach that the anime takes in their relationship developments is just as irritating where the plot keeps teeter-tottering their developments between going smoothly and strained on enough occasions throughout the show&#039;s run, which made me blow enough steam over why Shuuichi doesn&#039;t just jump ship from his angst-loaded lover having enough mood swings. To its credit, the series does at least provide decent fleshing-out of its prominent characters and provide some believable elements to the complications that arise when becoming a celebrity such as the paparazzi and handling the fast rise of fame acquired. However, these few positives elements aren&#039;t enough to outweigh my sheer annoyance of the main pairing of Gravitation as I could care less about neither their relationship nor characters because of how melodramatic they were. Unless you&#039;re a sap for any type of shounen-ai/ yaoi anime title, I wouldn&#039;t waste any time on Gravitation.

    When I first read about Gravitation, it was like gay anime? Never, ever... So I didn&#039;t take a second look. After a while I forgot the name and by coincidence still downloaded it. I started the first episode and at the beginning it seemed like a totaly normal Anime, no gayness whatever. Well, ok soon it begins to develop, but it&#039;s not tasteless. No in fact, you even forget the gay-theme for a second as Suichi seems to be more a girl then a boy...<br />
<br />
The Story is great, yes it is. A boy who wants to become a famous musican and gets into the big

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23891">
        world, why not. An author who writes novels especially for woman, but is gay himself, right! You won&#039;t see the whole picture at the beginning, episode by episode it develops more and more. And I think that&#039;s great, as you won&#039;t get bored! Gravitation has a lot of slapstick elements, it&#039;s comedy, a bit of dramatic and romantic.<br />
<br />
In fact: If you can suppress the gay theme (if you are not into it) and if you like romance anime, you could have a fun time watching Gravitation.<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t go into the Detail about the sound and art, I think there are enough reviews out there which already did so.

    ******this is a slight spoiler free******<br />
This anime is quite horrible .<br />
<br />
Story - 5 <br />
The story is somehow about being idols . Then there&#039;s a novelist and 1 of the idol is GAY  . And that idol dated a novelist has some black past .  Then they overcome it .  And HAPPY END ~ <br />
<br />
Art- 3 <br />
I wanted to give a 2 but since its a old anime i wont be so fussy . However being 2 or 3 it makes no different . Its horrible . The art is so horrible that makes me wanna drop the anime but luckily i survived

          <span style="display: none;" id="review171149">
        :) <br />
<br />
Sound - 5<br />
Nothing much so say . Just that the voice actors seems not experienced .... <br />
<br />
Character - 3 <br />
One of the most horrible thing in this anime . Firstly the MC shuichi , his actions sometimes are very exaggerating . For example his is running faster than a train ... and drop from sky above doesn&#039;t die and still can talk and sing =_= . And the clothes he&#039;s wearing is really ridiculous for example wearing hot pants and top above belly button.  Secondly , ryuichi . U GT SPLIT PERSONALITY ? WHY i said that ? In one moment his is very dumb and carefree and in another moment he is very serious . It pissed me off . And well and the guy who always mediate thing is hiro ( hiroshi ) and last but nt least is eiri he is really handsome XD <br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 2 <br />
What you expect me to enjoy from the poor quality and trying like idiot to make me laugh anime ? I was hoping for some sweet moment in this anime like another  shounen ai anime which is much more popular than this . But ofcourse i was disappointed .  As you can say there is almost no that kind of moments at all except that they went to date once only . <br />
<br />
In conclusion , this is 3/10 . DO NOT WATCH IT if you kind of have hoping for some  couples sweet quarrel in this shounen ai anime . <br />
<br />
Thank you .

    This is my first review so I&#039;ll keep it short :D <br />
<br />
I wouldn&#039;t wish this show upon my worst enemy. I was generous rating this a 3 since there were a few funny scenes, but getting through this show was rough. The main character was cute plenty of times, but every episode I found myself mad at them for doing things that made no sense whatsoever. I understand why the second main character, Yuki, acted the way he did later on, but their relationship was messed up throughout the whole series. This show makes it seem like it&#039;s supposed to be sweet how Shuuichi is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review413136">
        fighting for his love yet he&#039;s treated horribly 90% of the time. <br />
<br />
Okay I&#039;ll leave it there, I know a lot of people like this show so I&#039;m not trying to stop people from watching it. Personally, the execution of this show was extremely disappointing to me.

    This is a funny, and romantic history of Shindo Shuichi`s life. <br />
He was a normal school kid, who is a singer in his little band called Bad Luck, with his best friend and life partner Hiroshi.<br />
His life went on a turn when he met the great novelist Eiri Yuki. <br />
He fellt in love with Yuki, but Yuki plays a lot with Shuichi-kun.<br />
Shuichi and Hiro starts to grov with they`re music, and soon they reach the top. <br />
It`s a cute love-love story, with beautiful music, strong lines, funny characters and on the anime there are just awesome music:D<br />

    This is so CUTE! Ok, now that my fan girl love has been squeezed out, I’m sorry but I can’t help it! This show has everything a yoai girl would fall in love with. Cute guys, drama, romance between a cute little brother character and a hot older male. <br />
<br />
Shuichi is like a little brother, always acting out on his feelings even when it might get him into trouble. He also is known to put people in front of himself. He doesn’t care what happens to him as long as everyone else around him is happy. <br />
<br />
I love Hiro! His design is really cute and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review71083">
        he always teases Shuichi about his love and anything else but he is always there for him like a best friend should. <br />
<br />
I wish Yuki would be nicer to Shuichi. I feel so sorry for him since he keeps getting beat up by Yuki both mentally and physically. Most of the time, I wanted to punch Yuki for acting the way he did though that would of broken my screen. <br />
<br />
As you can tell, I really got into this one and my fan girl couldn’t help me get past the fact they weren’t real people. The way the creators made them, most of the time they felt like they could be people I would meet on the street one day.<br />
<br />
The artwork is kind of so so actually. It is beautiful when they put a lot of effort into it but then lacks in other places. The design of the eyes is beautiful and the romance scenes too but when we get into the comedy part, it lacks slightly. <br />
<br />
The music is rather awesome for a j-pop boy band. Some music is a miss for me but others like the opening are really awesome. Unfortunately, Yuki (English Dub) keeps sounding like he’s just reading lines and doesn’t show much emotion. I know he’s an angry guy but he could at least put a little more emotion to it. Shuichi (English Dub) does come across as a whinny little child sometimes although I think that’s part of why people like at least him.

    Oh, Gravitation. What can I say about you in this small review that can express my feelings about you? Let us see:<br />
<br />
Honestly, I don&#039;t understand why people don&#039;t enjoy this like I do. I can&#039;t expect everyone to like everything I do, but this one seemed like it could reach out to a lot of different people. I mean, it has a whole lot of comedy, but it still has its serious moments. My friends that like anime have read the manga and watched the anime, and we all LOVED it.<br />
<br />
Gravitation is, in my mind, one of the greatest things ever made. It&#039;s about a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review18029">
        singer named Shuichi Shindou who is in a band called Bad Luck with his best friend who plays the guitar named Hiro. He loses the lyrics to a new song and a mysterious man picks them up, and literally tells him that he sucks and that he has no talent.<br />
<br />
Later on, you find out that the man is Eiri Yuki, a famous novelist who is very popular with the ladies. And it just sorta takes off from there.<br />
<br />
At times, this whole show doesn&#039;t seem very realistic, but it&#039;s an anime. Who says it has to be realistic? <br />
<br />
Story: (9) This has some of the funniest stuff I have ever read in it. It gets really crude at times, but not as much as the manga. The story at times can get so random that it&#039;s hard to keep up, but in a good way.<br />
<br />
Art: (7) Gravitation does not have the greatest art in it. Although at times, it somehow adds to the anime. It&#039;s not an eyesore, but it&#039;s no Code Geass or Death Note.<br />
<br />
Sound: (10) Every song in this anime is in my top favorites. I bought the cd a while back, and I have every song memorized from beginning to end, especially Spicy Marmalade and Shining Collection.<br />
<br />
Character: (8): I love a majority of these characters. Shuichi is so immature that it&#039;s adorable! Eiri Yuki has so many sides, and I love each and every one of them! Ryuichi Sakuma is definitly my favorite character. He makes you think of a five year old, with Kumagoro (Mr. Bear, if you&#039;re watching the dubbed). K is the most badass person ever on the face of the planet!<br />
But some characters, I just want to stab in the neck with a knife, like, at first you might think you love Tohma, but then he&#039;s just a sick bastard that needs to die. Ayaka is just a bitch. That&#039;s all there is to it. (I was gonna say more, but this is really long!)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: (10) I easily give this a ten. I have watched the anime five times in a row now, and I still cry from laughing so hard at most points. It&#039;s just so random and innocent, yet sad and emotional all at the same time. You will sit there with tears of sadness running down your face, and all of a sudden you fall over laughing.<br />
<br />
Overall: (9) This has to be my favorite anime of all time (besides Death Note). It is just that amazing. If you don&#039;t like yaoi, then stay away. Especially from the manga. That is a lot more sexual than the anime. I highly recommend this, because it is just an anime that about everyone can get a good laugh from. ^.^<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading! =3<br />
~Tracy

    Gravitation is one of many shounen ai anime that i enjoyed so much.Shounen ai usually contain  numerous of fan-service and lovey-dovey moment. While Gravitation have this drama kind of aspect which differentiated the story from the others.<br />
<br />
STORY- 9/10<br />
I gave the story a high score because it absolutely deverse it, here some simple sypnopsis:<br />
Shuchi is a determined-singer who fall in love with a writer named Yuki Eiri. Throughout the story , shuuichi struglling in order to pursue his dream as singer and to pursue his love with Yuki. Lot of drama in this anime, this anime is the one and only shounen ai that made

          <span style="display: none;" id="review193198">
        me cry. Despite all of the drama and romance, the story is also very comedic and have this crazy character development every episode.<br />
<br />
ART-9/10<br />
The art was fine, but I do love 2000`s art. Gravitation has this brightful kind of art and full of colour.<br />
<br />
SOUND-9/10<br />
I love all the song in Gravitation, even the opening and ending. It sure has potential to be a good music anime. I like the soundtrack as well, it the one that really helped the drama scene or romance scene in the anime.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER-10/10<br />
All the characters are loveable. <br />
Shuuichi- my favourite character in thus anime is him. he very fun and quirky as well as cute. i fell in love with him. I always dreamed to hug him. Btw I am a boy :v.<br />
Yuki- jerk and calm are the words to describe him. Without yuki personality the romance and drama would never existed in gravitation. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment-10/10<br />
I absolutely love gravitation, it is my favourite shounen ai of all time.<br />
<br />
OVERALL-9/10<br />

    Hello, Everyone. We had Valentine&#039;s earlier this week. So, let&#039;s look at something romance-oriented. This series is based on a manga by Murakami Maki. In 2000, 2001 it was adapted into an anime by Studio Deen with help from Production Reed. Without further ado, let&#039;s look at Gravitation.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Our narrative opens with Bad Luck, a musical duo with singer Shindou Shuuichi &amp; guitarist Nakano Hiroshi. The two are being berated by their manager for their failure at coming up with new songs and with the deadlines rapidly approaching too. Which happens. Art isn&#039;t easy, you&#039;ve got to put it together bit by bit. That evening, Shuuichi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review211110">
        is walking while examining the lyrics he&#039;s got when they slip away from him and hit a passing stranger. A handsome and tall stranger. The young man call the lyrics garbage, saying that Shuuichi has no talent. This inspires Shuuichi to finish in order to prove this stranger wrong because Shuuichi greatly cares about his opinion, thinking he was cool.<br />
<br />
It turns out this stranger was Yuki Eiri, a popular romance writer. Shuuichi continues to run into Yuki, prompting the other man to question whether or not Shuuichi has fallen for him. The two eventually share a snog in an elevator, much to Shuuichi&#039;s delight and confusion. Can the two of them turn this chance encounter into a functional relationship or are they destined for failure?<br />
<br />
The biggest flaw with this series is the tone. For the first five episodes, it has a very light-hearted, fluffy type of tone with a lot of zany visual gags. In the sixth episode, things take a very abrupt, and very dark, turn and the rest of the series tries to balance the more serious content with the lighter and sillier elements, mainly leaning towards the lighter. I do give the series credit for trying to handle the darker aspects with gravity and not just letting them drop. However, it&#039;s still pretty awkward in spite of their best efforts. A big part of the problem is that this anime is also kind of stupid, with a lot of moments that are really absurd or even nonsensical. These scenes could work fine if the series didn&#039;t try mixing them with serious moments. A manager kicking in the door while holding a gun to introduce himself, that&#039;s actually really funny. A scene like that and a somewhat explicit, very serious assault scene, however, do not really belong in the same work.<br />
<br />
On the positive side, the zany moments are largely amusing and most the series, tonal awkwardness aside, is quite endearing and fun. The love story elements are effectively handled and there are a lot of sweet moments betwixt Shuuichi and Yuki.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
As a whole, the characters in this series are a lot of fun and most of our major cast have a nice amount of complexity. I quite like the stuff they do with Yuki&#039;s family and their issues and the best friend dynamic with Shuuichi &amp; Hiro is stellar. The character who really stands out, at least to me, is Hiro. I really like the way he&#039;s written. The issue is with our major antagonistic character, Aizawa Taki. The man comes across as cartoonishly evil and has no real motivation aside from a vague and petty jealousy. He&#039;s one-dimensional to the point where you could give him a serpent emblem and have him take orders from a man in a metal face mask and not change his characterisation in the slightest. Which wouldn&#039;t be an issue if the series were entirely zany but, due to the serious aspects, it becomes a problem.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The artwork is pretty nicely done with the characters and backgrounds getting some nice details. The visual jokes are largely effective as well. The biggest issue is that Bad Luck&#039;s musical performances are a bit lazy in terms of recycling footage.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The vocal cast in this is quite impressive. Seki Tomokazu &amp; Inoue Kazuhiko portray the chemistry between their characters really well. We also get strong performances from Orikasa Ai and Matsumoto Yasunori. The music is really strong. However, it suffers from laziness similar to the performance scenes. They keep using the same Bad Luck song. At least a third of the episodes, and more than half of Bad Luck&#039;s performances, seriously use the same song. While it is a good song it also gets a bit old after hearing it so many times in the span of thirteen episodes. Give credit to anime like Love Live and K-on, they give you a bunch of different songs that get used at varied enough times that none of them ever feel over-used.<br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
In addition to the lovely relationship between Shuuichi &amp; Yuki, we have a gent who outright states that he loves Yuki more than he loves anyone else. Ryuuichi is also quite homo-erotic and Yuki&#039;s brother is clearly also interested in boys.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
As a zany, comedic work, Gravitation is enjoyable and endearing. Its biggest failing is that its serious sub-plots are out of place and result in tonal awkwardness. Which does weaken the series quite a bit. Overall, though, I give the series a solid 7/10. If you&#039;re interested in seeing a nice romance with a lot of really funny, absurd moments, it may very well make a good choice for you. Just be aware that things are going to get serious and those scenes aren&#039;t going to play well with the rest of the series. Next week I&#039;m looking at Gangsta.

    Honestly, I have no idea what to say for this show. I heard about it years ago and was reminded of it again by a YouTuber who put it next to a positive representation to an LGBTQ+ show. <br />
Absolutely no offense to anyone whose a fan of this show, but... I&#039;m so confused as to how. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s fair giving a review on it since I haven&#039;t finished it (I don&#039;t really want to...), but I am honestly so baffled by the remark in making this a positive representation when the show itself leads to I think so many problems that I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311133">
        have with shows that are lent towards the shonen ai/yaoi genre. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6/10  <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t say that I didn&#039;t enjoy this show but from a gulity pleasure prespective of the cheesy late 90s-early 00s period of anime. It reeks in cliches we&#039;ve grown to know, and speaking for myself, love. <br />
<br />
First of all, the obvious cut corners for the budget cuts even from the first episode alone, when they loose live action footage to replace animating a run cycle. It is so unexpected and goofy, and I can&#039;t help but love it ironically. <br />
<br />
But I say that in regards to all of the enjoyment I got from this run through of it. <br />
<br />
Character: 5/10<br />
<br />
These characters felt a lot like card board cut outs to me. From how they&#039;re designed to what they say, they felt like little paper puppets on a stick performing on a screen. They&#039;re not memorable to me, and fade in with all the other characters I&#039;ve read as a stupid kid upon first running into this genre. <br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
<br />
I&#039;m personally not a fan of the music either, but I can see it being objectably good. Since this show&#039;s main focus is on a music career, I think it would have to be. And I&#039;ll give it that it is, it&#039;s just not my taste. <br />
<br />
Art: 4/10<br />
<br />
Again, a product of its time. And I&#039;m not a fan of art from around this era. The designs are extremely tacky and almost expected of each character type? <br />
<br />
Also, I&#039;ve always tended to stray away from this type of style in which case they have one of the men look like a child and the other of more a mature adult. It&#039;s not a good look for me. This anime definitely has that. <br />
<br />
Story: 3/10 <br />
<br />
If you were to throw the summary off Gravitation as a quick pitch, as a shonen-ai, I would have thought it would&#039;ve been a decent story. However, it&#039;s delivered in its situations is not what I think as cute or ideal. <br />
<br />
The romance, or whatever you want to label it as, is very showy but there wasn&#039;t any chemistry behind it. <br />
<br />
There are scenes with Yuki bad mouth and degrading Shuichi, but then making out with him right afterwards, to be followed with, &quot;Don&#039;t let the kiss give you the wrong idea.&quot; <br />
??? Fool, you came on to him. That&#039;s so... weird????<br />
<br />
There are many different scenerios that Shuichi gets himself into these situations where all these different men have their florally sparkle twink twink gauassian blur moment but there&#039;s absolutely no build up, maybe aside from his band mate that one time. But as I will mention again, designing a youthful character and pairing him with a more mature looking character is creepy. If you&#039;re going to make these characters somewhat around the same age, don&#039;t make them look so contrasted. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t think I would be as hard on this show if I didn&#039;t see a YouTuber with a decently sized following recommend it over other shonen-ai that I thought has a lot more commendable substance than this one.  <br />

    Gravitation was probably the only anime which really made me appreciate Yaoi, because the whole story was just amazing. The whole series shows a typical relationship between two guys, one being older than the other. Even though it seems as if it will be predictable, there&#039;s still a dark past and secrets which are un-known. Gravitation is probably one of the most well known Yaoi&#039;s because it was the first of it&#039;s time. There&#039;s quite a bit of comedy throughout the series, and every character has a side which you&#039;ll love about them. What really gripped me in this anime though was how the relationship

          <span style="display: none;" id="review11138">
        had such a big age gap, and it wasn&#039;t a magical anime, or anything like that including powers it was just a normal couple going through different stages - and thats why i love it.<br />
<br />
Shuichi Shindou wants his band Bad Luck to be big in the music business, and with his best friend Hiro and Suguru Fujisaki his dreams become reality. He&#039;s a very mad, energetic character and probably my favourite, because he never gives up. Bad luck was his whole life until he meets Yuki one day, and cant get him out of his head. He realises his idols are now his rivals, his friends have there own problems and the one he&#039;s madly in love with is hard to please.<br />
<br />
Eiri Yuki, suprisingly a character who gets away with anything because he can be so charming. His attitude can be terrible though, and he prefers to block people out instead of letting them in. He&#039;s done things which he&#039;s not proud of, but his writing career sometimes helps to make him forget. Shuichi ends up in Yuki&#039;s apartment and slowly into his heart, even though Yuki may hate him at times. <br />
<br />
Other characters such as Hiro, and Ryuichi are brilliant and really make the series a whole lot better. Hiro is always there for Shuichi and is really dedicated to the band, and soon gets his own love problems. Ryuichi is the lead singer for Shuichi&#039;s favourite band, Nittle Grasper and changes from his idol into his rival. They stay friends though, and Ryuichi is probably one of the most comical characters.<br />
<br />
Tohma Seguchi is forever trying to split Yuki and Shuichi up and Mr Sakuma is forever stressing out. One of my favourite characters though has to be K, Bad Lucks mad manager who always carries round a gun and forces everyone to do what he wants them to.<br />
<br />
I was addicted to Gravitation and i still am, and i would recommend it to anyone. Even Yaoi (Boy x Boy) haters this could still be an anime you&#039;de like, it&#039;s a boy who&#039;s music dream and love life collide, and i think it&#039;s highly enjoyable.

    okay~ gravitation.<br />
<br />
i was buying DVDs one day and stumbled upon this one. seriously, i did NOT know it was shounen ai. it must have been fate that brought us together :)<br />
better that i said it earlier, it was shounen ai, not yaoi. (aww, makes me sad)<br />
<br />
plot: 8/10<br />
i found the story cool actually. i mean a writer falls in love with a singer? that isn&#039;t one thing you&#039;d see in everyday life. but when the story gets a move i found myself bored because of the love-hate relationship. sort of like taming a dog using the candy and whip. but the latter part was a surprise

          <span style="display: none;" id="review26493">
        :)<br />
<br />
art: 8/10<br />
the art is good enough for what it&#039;s worth, which pretty much means... uhm. if you&#039;ve seen sukisho, it&#039;s kind of like of the same level, only with darker shades and cruder details. but if you haven&#039;t, i think it is safe to say that the art is &quot;cute&quot;. haha. ugh. words fail me.<br />
<br />
sound: 9/10<br />
since the main character is a singer, then expect songs! but not too much amount of songs. haha. yeah. just right. i didn&#039;t placed much attention to the seiyuus so, sorry about that. but the bg music doesn&#039;t affect much.<br />
<br />
characters: 9/10<br />
i don&#039;t have anything much to say about the characters. i didn&#039;t like yuki&#039;s (seme) temper =__= i found myself shocked whenever he turns cold towards shuuichi. but i couldn&#039;t bring myself to hate him because he says too much pick up lines. haha. shuuichi is your average clingy uke.<br />
<br />
enjoyment: 8/10<br />
well, it kept me pretty well entertained for the time being. i wanted more action actually. =__= but it provided more fluff. haha. i think it&#039;s good for those who cannot handle yaoi but likes shounen ai.<br />
<br />
overall: 8/10<br />
compared to other shounen ai anime i&#039;ve seen, this is probably one of the best. there are only a handful of such anime, so i&#039;d recommend it to those who likes shounen ai. i&#039;m influenced heavily by the art and story so no surprise about that :)<br />
<br />
owari :)<br />
