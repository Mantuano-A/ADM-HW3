    If you are a fan of the game, you will NOT enjoy this. If you remember certain side quests from the games where some iconic enemies appear, they will appear in different areas with original stories tied to them-- in a bad way. Maybe the last few minutes of the first episode and some of the last episode are the only things from the games plot that somewhat made it in. That&#039;s it. Not a single supporting character from the game made it in. The rest of the show is nothing but liberties taken from the studio without adapting the games actual story. They conclude

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356317">
        the story in 7 episodes. This is just another example of a video game being poorly adapted into an anime where they don&#039;t focus on what the fans want.

    I liked it. It&#039;s not a great show, but it&#039;s pretty good for what it is.<br />
Many fans will be disappointed by how it picks up the Dragon/Arisen tale and combines it with the concept of Sin. Personally, I was surprised but not appalled by it. Especially since we know of the 7 Sins concept since the show&#039;s OP has been made public.<br />
<br />
Dragon&#039;s Dogma, in my opinion, is not a story about exactly one tale that has been depicted in the Dragon&#039;s Dogma game, but a term for a universe setting involving key mechanics which are the Arisens, Pawns and Dragons in question: A franchise. See

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356347">
        Dragon&#039;s Dogma Progress and Dragon&#039;s Dogma Online.<br />
<br />
I say this especially because Dragon&#039;s Dogma Online, which went with a completely different story and setting where Arisen are chosen ones by the White Dragon of Lestania to carry out its will, shows exactly that. Obviously this story and setting was changed to match the MMORPG genre, but this shows that DD is a franchise of stories instead of a single one, similar to Final Fantasy. The first FF game may have set the tone, world and terms, but it&#039;s not the defining game that has no equal, as the years clearly showed.<br />
<br />
The short stories the sins evolve around are simple. They are easy to understand, there&#039;s a clear &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; theme surrounding them at first. With time, these plots become a bit more difficult as everyone is prone to be corrupted by one of the sins in question. Even the characters you at first don&#039;t expect to.<br />
<br />
The animation is not consistent but stays on an above average level. Where they had no 3D models for characters they reverted to limited hand drawn animation, which is noticeable. Especially at the final scene of the show they mix 3D and 2D character animation which is quite bad.<br />
The character&#039;s expressions are really well made and can hold up with GBVS, even some side characters have a great expression range and have been given much detail with their movement and posing.<br />
The big monsters break the cel-shading illusion though, but it&#039;s not nearly as bad as I initially thought it would be, but it might put off viewers.<br />
<br />
The Japanese voice acting is good, they chose a fitting cast for the roles.<br />
There is however a huge difference in script between JP and EN which you notice when watching JP audio with EN subtitles where it&#039;s more than often not only &quot;they say it different in English&quot; but &quot;they say something completely different&quot;. Depending on your understanding of Japanese, the subtitles will definitely annoy you quite often. I cannot comment on the English dub as I haven&#039;t seen that one (yet).<br />
<br />
Except for the OP, the music is unfortunately low-key and exchangeable with any generic soundtrack.<br />
<br />
Regarding content there is quite a bit nudity, sexual themes and gore.<br />
Monsters in the show are Cyclops, Griffin, Hydra, Lich and.... Goblins.<br />
<br />
Overall, I enjoyed it. It was a bit sad that the plot replaced the purpose of the Dragon to be a test for the position of the Seneschal with this watered down one. However, as I wrote in the beginning, I see this as an independent story within the universe, so it&#039;s perfectly fine in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d rate it a 7/10.

    Story : It&#039;s (isn&#039;t) an anime where normal people (at least yet I suppose) are weak enough to need help fighting wolves. So I guess it is a more or less realistic approach to a fantastic serie.<br />
Yet it&#039;s kind of boring, but it&#039;s only the first episode, there is not real plot except for we learn that Dragon attacked 100 years ago, and decided to come back today.<br />
<br />
Art : That bit** ugly.. We&#039;re in 2020, yet the 3D is horrendous, even Ajin&#039;s 3D looks better than this.<br />
<br />
Sound : It&#039;s an English &quot;anime&quot;, it&#039;s strange because I feel like I&#039;m watching a dub. Other than that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358552">
        it doesn&#039;t feel great.<br />
<br />
Character : That boy stupid. He doesn&#039;t listen to his brother, and causes more problem than anything. I already despise him.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : No.<br />
<br />
Overall : I&#039;m just bored, the graphics aren&#039;t pleasing, neither are the dubs and the story.

    This is a parody of a dark fantasy, simplified and boiled down to a script children could perform on a stage. Caveman-like, basic dialogue with crude, ill-defined small stories of human depravity while the MC descends into hell himself. It&#039;s lifeless and devoid of character. Basically, a studio exec decided to make a dark fantasy following a cookie cutter formula. 1. It needs to be dark, so no happy endings and people need to kill each other for the sole sake of earning that &quot;dark&quot; badge, no matter how pointless. 2. It&#039;s medieval fantasy so we need a forgettable boss battle every episode. 3. Much

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357274">
        like how broadcast execs whine they can&#039;t compete with cable because they can&#039;t pump their shows full of profanity and nudity in lieu of actual substance and plot, mindless sex scenes will really help sell that adult rating here. But unlike a humorous and satirical parody, there are no jokes, and they are dead serious in it&#039;s gravity. It shares many similarities with Castlevania, including the same spotty voice acting, sombre atmosphere, and even some copied set pieces. The 3D animation is laughably bad. Not only do they talk at half speed, they also move with the same robotic inertia. I started wishing for a 2x speed button on Netflix, and started pushing the 10 second fast forward habitually to skip long expanses of nothingness, which is an indictment unto itself since I&#039;m usually meticulous about watching whole episodes. My last pet peeve is how much slow, agonizing dialogue the dragon gets, prattling on about the sins of man, and constantly misusing thine (which only goes before a vowel) instead of thy. If you are going to make the effort to give him a booming, self-important voice full of thous, thees, and thines, do the basic research to understand their usage.

    This show is just weird. I now it is based off a game and the animation is really good it&#039;s just kinda felt rushed and the ending felt like it went nowhere for a seven episodes it kind went in a circle we really only see one character develop and it&#039;s not even the main one. I don&#039;t know what to say about this show except it had really good pacing and animation and that is about as far as it goes. I kinda wish that the end could of had a different ending but since it followed the game it just had that game

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356299">
        vibe and the game ending without any plot twist to speak of. The one character that had development wasn&#039;t even really shown but instead was kinda just implied so that is why I gave it a 7.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Now, I&#039;ve never played the game that this is anime is based off. If I had, then I would&#039;ve been EVEN MORE annoyed at this adaption. This anime is absolutely terrible, and I honestly can&#039;t believe that a lot of time was spent on this project. The whole story sounded basic because of the revenge plot to kill the dragon that destroyed the main character&#039;s village. Very basic yet, it was terrible regardless. Revenge plots can be interesting, but other times, it&#039;s absolute crap. <br />
<br />
Positive:<br />
When the audio for the characters was recorded, the actors were in the same recording booth to help

          <span style="display: none;" id="review360282">
        the emotions and dialogue. This was a clever move, and it shows in the story. <br />
<br />
<br />
Negative:<br />
The animation has tons of flaws, such as very basic deaths that are animated in such lazy designs and fighting scenes. The main character, Ethan, is basic and fails to leave an impact on the viewer. Each episode felt like I was watching how the seven deadly sins can affect people. This can be a fun idea and help develop new stories. But this seems like the writing was so lazy and confusing. Every potential that that is shown is immediately ruined in a garbage fire of trash. I don&#039;t relate to these characters, and I feel bored. I was even more bored than watching school days, and high school prodigies have it easy in another world. Those animes at least had a high moment in the series. Dragon&#039;s Dogma has no high points at ALL! Even the final fight was a disappointment! <br />
<br />
The dragon explains that the reason for destroying Ethan&#039;s village was compared to Ethan&#039;s need to breathe. We humans need to breathe to live our lives. A dragon needing to destroy a village to help live their life is the most CONFUSING and LAZY plot twist that I have EVER witnessed. I honestly feel bad for the animators that worked tirelessly on the animation because there are moments where it&#039;s amazing. Unfortunately,  there are also weak moments in the animation. It&#039;s just disappointing in general. <br />
<br />
Dragon&#039;s Dogma is a lazy disappointment of an anime, and I feel like I would&#039;ve enjoyed the Netflix live-adaptation of death note would&#039;ve been a better option for me to watch. I wouldn&#039;t say I liked this show; I&#039;d rather say that I absolutely hated it!

    Watching Dragon&#039;s Dogma felt as if I was watching unrendered CGI. The characters seemed emotionless and the show does a poor job at creating strong relationships with the characters and viewers. The voice acting is poor, the story is poor, and the characters are poor. So what is good about Dragon&#039;s Dogma? Everything that comes out of the dragon&#039;s mouth is quite enjoyable (He do be preaching tho). Episode 1 does a good job of telling viewers that Dragons are not the ones to f*ck with. They are evil sinister creatures and Dragons Dogma does well in making the dragon feel menacing and intimidating.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, Dragon&#039;s

    I think I fell asleep three times watching this show. If I had one word to describe this show it would be this: yikes. Netflix originals are very hit or miss, and this is as big of a swing and a miss and you will get. There are 7 episodes, each tackling a different sin (cool concept not gonna lie). But wow was this done badly. The characters in this show meant nothing to me, every death in this show was boring, and the CG was close to Arifureta bad. You need to watch this show with friends to laugh at it together. Do not

    Netflix just can’t have a rest can they? They air or license good (Little Witch Academia, Great Pretender) or at least popular (Nanatsu no Taizai, Naruto) anime from time to time but when it comes to their originals, it looks like they are cursed to make crude CGI snorefests that almost nobody bothers to watch, and when they do, they usually don’t like them because of very good reasons.<br />
<br />
One of them being that their products are based on popular and cherished IPs and leave a bad mark on them, it happened before with Saint Seiya, which almost nobody liked, it also happened with Ghost in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review365001">
        the Shell Stand Alone Complex 2045 which had a better reception because apparently the GitS’ fandom is not as critical as I thought, and it happens again with Dragon’s Dogma.<br />
<br />
Based on an action rpg game by Capcom which I never played, I normally wouldn’t watch it because videogames anime adaptations are never a good sing, yet this time I did for the next three reasons:<br />
<br />
1-Is so rare to get a dark fantasy anime set in a classical medieval setting instead of an edgy magical girls show these days and that alone is a reason to check it out for me.<br />
<br />
2-It’s very short meaning that even if it’s crap it can be finished in just one day.<br />
<br />
3-THE OPENING THEME IS AWESOME, it was probably taken from the videogame for all I know but it was enough to get my attention, especially after the pleasant surprise I got from Magatsu Wahrheit: Zuerst, another rpg based anime with an amazing opening.<br />
<br />
The series suffers from the exact same issue as almost all the other videogame anime adaptations that I watched suffer from, the transition from one medium to another is not well done. Although videogames can have a good story, they ultimately rely mostly on gameplay thus their writing is rarely that good and when it comes to rpgs it’s almost a necessity for them to have lots of sidequests (good sidequests that is) to justify their duration and prices. <br />
<br />
When you translate that to a series or a movie, where the focus is in the plot, it doesn’t work either because:<br />
<br />
-The story was never good such as the case with every 90s fighting game which had anime adaptations and they were mediocre at best; <br />
<br />
-Reading exposition at your own pace when playing a videogame is not the same than having to sit and watch people talk on a series and it gets tiresome and boring very fast as it happened many times before but lets use the currently airing King’s Raid as an example, the first three episodes were abysmal because of all the talking and for how generic it is to the point of making people drop the show after rating in low.<br />
<br />
-A single cour series or a single movie is just not enough time to adapt properly the whole plot of a videogame which lasts for at least thrice the duration and thus contains a lot more lore, twists and characterization, that was the case with Xenosaga, which was also badly animated and thus it didn’t do justice to its supossed epic space war premise;<br />
<br />
-Is just boring when you have to follow a series where the makers clearly took an avatar protagonist and slapped him in the adaptation without giving him a proper characterization, as was the case with Granblue Fantasy or Princess Connect: Re Dive! and we can use King’s Raid as an example in here as well.<br />
<br />
-Or finally, throwing too much content from the sidequests in the adaptation drags the pacing and makes it a chore to watch, while at the same time forces the makers to rush the ending in order to finish the series.<br />
<br />
In the case of Dragon’s Dogma, almost all of these points are present, the story is very simple, is just a guy trying to get revenge on a single dragon, which hardly excuses the duration of a full series. <br />
<br />
Yet it plays out in an almost completely episodic manner exactly because it includes side monsters placed randomly in order to have epic battles and makes the protagonist look dumb for jumping to help any random person he encounters instead of focusing on his own objective. And calling these fights epic is a stretch as the CGI does not do them justice. Honestly, is not that bad because the models look alright, but the backgrounds and the special effects are simple, and the motions are just sloppy, whether on times of relaxing or in the middle of a battle.<br />
<br />
To be fair, Dragon’s Dogma tries, as there is a little plot continuity and there is potential for good dark fantasy material in these stories, not for the sex, drugs and violence which are hardly impactful thanks to the poor CG, is the rushed pacing of every episode what prevents the dark themes to be explored properly.<br />
<br />
Every episode is named after a deadly sin (that is the reason why they are seven) but the representation of them is questionable. The first is “Wrath” because it shows the protagonist losing everything he loves and setting on a journey to get a personal vendetta on the dragon…because the latter told him to. How is it sinful when you didn’t do anything wrong, someone takes everything from you and you set on getting revenge on him because he baits you into doing so?<br />
<br />
Also, I don’t know about you but for me, a villain who keeps alive someone who wants to kill him and encourages him to do so is just a bad antagonist, even more if he’s absent for most of the story and lets the hero become stronger, which is exactly what happens here.<br />
<br />
Now that I mentioned that, how is this protagonist supposed to kill the dragon? He is not even a soldier and he got owned completely by the dragon, yet he expects to kill him without even training? What?<br />
<br />
Anyways, the second episode is “Gluttony” and is thematically the most interesting of the bunch, as it shows a village where the food is taken from the people by their governors, sacrifices are made to a ciclop, which for some reason is controlled with a single whip and at the end of the story, once all the villains are defeated, the whole starving village goes out of control and everyone becomes an enemy of each other. It was a great dark turn of events because the protagonist ended up doing more harm than good helping these people but sadly it comes off as rushed because it happens at the very end of the episode.<br />
<br />
The next ones are not as interesting, I don’t know why “Envy” is called as such when it features rapist goblins, a clear attempt to cash in Goblin Slayer’s infamy and a woman who married a guy just because of his money and tries to seduce the protagonist. The only relevant thing in this episode are the two soldiers that appear on “Greed” and gives the series a continuity.<br />
<br />
Only to have them with their personalities changed completely from one moment to another due to the spell of a lich, again, how is someone a greedy sinner when is not acting like himself because he’s under the control of another being? He’s not doing horrible things on his own and suffering the consequences of his own actions, he’s being used.<br />
<br />
In the middle of these stories there is sloth, an episode dedicated to an abandoned village full of drug addicts who cheat on their wives in front of their very own eyes in order to escape from the gritty reality they live on. Thus they don’t work and do nothing when a freaking hydra comes in and destroys their village and kills some women. Another episode full of interesting ideas that are not treated properly because the guys of the village have zero characterization besides cheating on ther wives, before they snap and are able to help kill a hydra when they could barely stand on their feet 5 minutes before because they were under the effects of a strong drug.<br />
<br />
Lust was easily the best episode for me, as it deals with the internal struggle of the main protagonist, tempted by a succubus that adopts the form of his dead wife, and he does not let her fool him, the finale of the episode was the highlight of the series for me. <br />
<br />
Up until this point, the protagonist was boring, he had a simple personality and a simple past, not very different than a kindhearted shounen or a harem protagonist who helps everyone he encounters just because, but in these last episodes he becomes obsessed with revenge and becomes colder and ultimately, what he sought to destroy. Always an interesting idea, but there was no build up to it because he changed completely out of screen. <br />
<br />
The most interesting character in the series is Hannah, his sidekick and, if you notice, the only character whose name I remember, simply because is the most memorable of the bunch. She begins as a “pawn” as they call her in the show, which I assume are artificial beings created to assist the Arisen, people who have their hearts taken by the dragon, this is all stuff that I assume as someone who had not played the game, as the series does not bother to explain all of this stuff and barely implies it.<br />
<br />
As a pawn, Hannah is basically heartless and soulless, she doesn’t have emotions, only thinks about how to do things in the most logical course of action, does not know how to speak without hurting others with her direct approach, and at times throws some lines of dialogue about how foolish and emotional creatures are we, the humans. She’s also the real powerful character in the main duo, while the protagonist can only fight thanks to a some sort of dark power gave to him by the dragon, his enemy. <br />
<br />
By the end of the series she becomes a lot more human than any other character to the point of being unable of helping the protagonist and put an end to a tragic cicle at the very end, but unfortunately this also happens without build up and out of screen.<br />
<br />
And finally there’s the last episode, “Pride”, which is the heaviest on themes, monologues, plot twists and character regressions, but it all feels rushed, preachy, and it devoids all the characters of any free will while also leaves you thinking that almost all of the episodes thus far were unfocused, which they were.<br />
<br />
So, you are not watching this series for the setting which is vaguely explored, nor the themes which are bombarded to you in the last episode, nor the plot which is very simple, episodic and unfocused, nor the characters which are as bland as they get, nor the action because, although the fights have some choreography, the weak cg makes them look junky and they always come down to the protagonist becoming enraged and letting his dark powers control him to kill a threat he could barely do anything against up until that moment.<br />
<br />
Good ideas here and there, a mostly serious tone (although saying this is kind of a stretch), and a good sound department thanks to the epic score and the acceptable sound effects and voice acting, in particular the dragon who may not sound frightening nor imposing but he sounds old and wise, partially thanks to the way he speaks, incorporating old japanese words which are in turned subtitled with early modern english, but other than that, there isn’t much to see here, especially when there’s so much better options out there such as:<br />
<br />
-1997 Berserk, easily the best dark fantasy anime of all times and I’m also one of those who thinks that the cgi movies are decent as well. I would like to say the same about the manga but I didn’t read it yet.<br />
<br />
-Vinland Saga, which has a similar character arc for its main protagonist, done a hundred times better, along with a lot more interesting themes and characters, at least in its anime and first arc of the manga.<br />
<br />
-The Hobbit movie trilogy which has some similarities with this title, especially the third one (and I guess this also applies to the book).<br />
<br />
-Shadow of the Collosus has some similarities in its protagonist as well as an amazing atmosphere and innovating gameplay for its time, and I hope it never gets an adaptation because the result would come off like this.<br />
<br />
-There is also the Castlevania 2d cartoon series, also a Netflix original, also a dark fantasy, with an almost anime art style, japanese voices, and Belmont and Sylpha even have somewhat similar designs to this main duo. A lot cooler.<br />
<br />
-Blue Gender is completely different but has similar character arcs for its main duo, only a lot better.<br />
<br />
-As for the few anime based on videogames that I watched which cracked the code for making a proper product there are Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, because it tells its own what if story and focuses on the spectacle while still providing enough context to understand the plot of the game on a basic level thanks to its first scene. Now I know that fans of the game usually hate the movie for the way the main characters are portrayed, but they fit well with their roles in the movie, but that’s not something to talk about here.<br />
<br />
-The other one is Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis, which uses its source material only in concept and tells an otherwise completely different story. Now, its writing is garbage and is barely worth watching only because of its characters, production values, and focus on the cool and fun aspect. So, as you see even these ones are nothing special.<br />
<br />
-I would like to include Magatsu Wahrheit: Zuerts as well because is doing the same as Bahamut in the sense that it only uses the concept of its source material to tell its own story, with better writing and characterization than that series but it is still airing and thus it can still mess everything up.<br />

    garbage netflix cgi of what is otherwise a decent property<br />
<br />
ethan (mc) gained power, in no satisfying way. not through being a prodigy, or through training, but through destiny or something similar.<br />
<br />
ethan also gained essentially no character development. Rather than becoming a more fleshed out character or more understood by the audience over the course of these seven episodes, he just became more rage filled. While, ironically, the supposedly emotionless pawn (Hannah) grew into a more fleshed out character than he became in episode 2.<br />
<br />
overall, I&#039;m not qualified to judge sound quality. Although I consider it to be decent, as I could hear and understand every

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356885">
        character throughout the entire series and the musical direction was good enough; although it never brought any emotion out from me, and I can&#039;t consider it to be anything special. <br />
<br />
that being said, if you&#039;re someone like me who enjoys watching things that are pretty shitty, you&#039;ll probably gain at least some enjoyment from watching this. But don&#039;t go into it thinking it&#039;s good, by any means<br />
<br />
if it were reanimated into a more traditional anime style, everything else being the same, it would get something around a 4-6 from me simply due to the art direction being better. the character development and story are still garbage though; just play the game instead.

    After watching many series, it is increasingly difficult to find good anime. Just 2 or 3 new anime are worth each season. Of the recent Netflix originals, Dragon&#039;s Dogma is pretty good. What is more difficult, it made me want to continue watching it, when I finished one chapter I wanted to see another: 7 chapters have passed very quickly. Although the series is not a masterpiece, with a CGI that not everyone will like, nor a story that everyone will like (especially if you come from the video game), it develops each self-concluding chapter very well, with a touch that reminds of Berserk, which

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356730">
        It suits him really well. The mythical creatures, the medieval setting and two main characters that evolve in a very short space of time, gives a lot of life to the series. Treating each of the chapters as capital sins seems to me a success that never goes out of style. There is also deep content to discuss (for example, human nature) and not just empty and superficial dialogue as in most current anime. My grade is 9, not because it really deserves it (I would give it a 7-7.5 or so), but to encourage Netflix to make more and better series of this type (some of the ones it released in 2019 seemed to me lousy). By the way, the Japanese dubbing seems like the original to me and it&#039;s much better than in English.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
At the time of writing I have only sat through the first 4 episodes but I feel that&#039;s more than enough to get a feel for the 7 episode series. And sadly I have to say the feel is not good. Things go awry in episode 1, where the entirety of Cassardis ends up burnt down by the dragon with no survivors outside of the main character, the Arisen. Now there is a big problem with that. If you played the game, you&#039;d know that when the dragon attacked everyone, even the soldiers meant to protect people, fled. With your protagonist being

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356327">
        the only one to take in combat and try to defend the village thus having the dragon steal your heart. The dragon then disappears giving you ample time to explore the world with enough urgency to need to go forward but enough leniency to feel comfortable taking your time becoming stronger. <br />
<br />
This is where for me the biggest issue with this series comes. Instead of letting you get familiar and acquainted with the world and characters, a strong sense of urgency is introduced as everyone the main character knows dies, and the dragon takes countless lives before hiding in the mountain. <br />
<br />
Now, there is nothing specifically wrong about that as a direction however, the show is working with a generic stalwart hero who is already powerful and already has strong flawless values from the get go and a literal lifeless emotionless pawn. Other characters appear in episodes however they seem to exist only to ham fist some moral and get lectured by the main character. <br />
<br />
That alone is enough to make me tired of the show, and quite disappointed seeing the wasted potential on offer. As far as 3D animation goes, this might genuinely be one of the best series to use it. The animation is fluid, the art style is fantastic, and the visual effects on spells and fire can be breath-taking at times. <br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s disappointing. Considering the game already has a strong plot, and the mechanics in the game more than allow for cool scenes and plot elements the decision to ignore all of that and do their own thing just feels baffling.

    I have never played the Dragon&#039;s Dogma video game, but this anime actually made me interested in playing the original game, so there&#039;s that at least. Still, the Dragon&#039;s Dogma show is subpar in pretty much every category. <br />
<br />
Both the studio that made this show (Sublimation) and the director have only one other credit, a short movie called Walking Meat that no one seems to have seen. Right then and there I should have known this anime would be a little rough with inexperienced people at the helm. Both the animation and sound are decent (4/10) but never, ever rise above mediocrity. Actually, I&#039;ll point

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402324">
        out the intro song as the highlight of the show, filled with macabre visuals like skeletons clutching hearts and each other. This great intro always made me pumped for the disappointing show I was about to watch. The CGI animation always looked pretty bad, though. Like it was never Berserk 2016 levels of crap, but the CG in other shows such as Ajin still looked a million times better. There was also no memorable battle music at all. <br />
<br />
Our story was incredibly bland and rushed (4/10). Yes, I&#039;d say this show&#039;s biggest sin was its pacing, as the director attempted to cram probably 30 hours of RPG story into just 7 half hour episodes. Impossible! Everything I hear from fans of the game indicates that he butchered the story and cut out many beloved characters. I know for a fact that you can have three Pawns in the game, but our Arisen here only has one. Honestly this premise had potential: a dragon ravages main character&#039;s village and murders his pregnant wife. It even rips out the protagonist&#039;s heart, who is reborn as an Arisen and wants revenge on said dragon. Sadly the show wastes this cool premise on bland characters and poor execution. If you want a good example of a similar type of show, watch Dota: Dragon&#039;s Blood, also based on a video game and on Netflix. There are seven episodes in Dragon&#039;s Dogma and each revolves around a different &quot;seven deadly sin,&quot; which is a very cool idea. Once again a cool idea is ruined by shoddy execution. <br />
<br />
The characters were extremely weak (4/10) and seemed more like slaves to the plot than anything else. Hell, Hannah describes herself as a Pawn, and she is just that in the story! What do I mean by all this? Well in the episode &quot;Envy&quot; a husband has to act totally out of character and murder his wife at the end of the episode, just so we can see a jealous man envious of other men. A noble knight has to act totally out of character in the &quot;Greed&quot; episode and murder his best friend, just to show that men can be greedy. He is overcome by greed after touching the Lich King&#039;s gold coin, ok, but then why was Ethan fine after touching the exact same coin beforehand? No time to think about such things! I wanted to like Ethan because I definitely sympathized with his plight, but he was just a generic warrior out for revenge for the majority of the show. There were even a few times he came off unlikable, as he refused to help innocents unless it directly coincided with his revenge plot. The Pawn Hannah I feel had the most potential for character development, but we never really learn anything about her. She literally exists just to be an aid to Ethan and that...sucks. <br />
<br />
My enjoyment for this anime was pretty low (4/10) because I thought the episodes were too rushed. I also felt cheated by the abrupt ending. Even when Ethan was having his climactic rematch with the dragon I really didn&#039;t feel anything at all. Overall I have to say this is a disappointing, below average anime. 4/10

    Anyone contemplating watching this but is turned off by the score, go ahead and watch it, it&#039;s good. <br />
<br />
The story is pretty decent. Nothing crazy, it&#039;s a revenge story where the premise is about a guy who gets his heart mugged by a dragon, then meets a strange girl who tells him cryptic shit, and then off the duo goes to kill the dragon. Nothing you haven&#039;t seen or heard of before.<br />
<br />
The stories charm is in its simplicity with a nice little twist at the end. I CANNOT stress this enough. So many reviews are shitting on this show for not doing enough when all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review384030">
        you have to do is view from a different lens. This is SIMPLE story. It has a monster of the day format and each episode is wrapped in a theme representing one of the cardinal sins. This a short and sweet seven episode action show that just gets the job done. Near the end, it got just a tad bit on the nose with whole sin stuff, but overall, it has a very consistent tone. If, for some reason, you&#039;re expecting some ground breaking story that&#039;s going to make you see life differently, you will be disappointed. If you&#039;re in the mood for a gritty medieval fantasy action show, this is a treat. And again, it&#039;s literally SEVEN episodes, you can finish this in an afternoon.<br />
<br />
Nothing much to say for characters, for an anime this short, the characters are fine. Ranging from somewhat bland to somewhat interesting. No one is dumb or annoying, which is the most you should expect (especially these days). They don&#039;t have a lot of depth but their presentation is done well. Hannah and Ethan&#039;s character arcs run in parallel to one another and I think they pulled it off pretty well. Uhh yeah nothing else to say. <br />
<br />
Okay the visuals. Sometimes the hate CG graphics get is just crazy. So yeah, it has 3DCG art, if you can&#039;t handle that for whatever &quot;2D anime purity&quot; reason, this isn&#039;t for you. If you can, the show looks really good. It has an appropriate amount of color, the magic effects are very sharp and crisp, some of the locations are really well done, the others get the job done, nothing that will blow you away. The characters look good, clearly taking design from the game, the monsters have the impact they&#039;re supposed to have. I have NO IDEA why other reviewers are saying it looks &quot;unrendered&quot; or &quot;unfinished&quot; or &quot;the worst CG imaginable&quot;, like what are you even comparing this to? Same thing for the action, it&#039;s actually really good and incredibly well choreographed. Oh and a side note, keep in mind this show is pretty gritty with LOTS of nudity, take that as you will. <br />
<br />
The sound was enjoyable. The things I liked the most were the sound effects and overall audio engineering involved; the fact this was a Netflix original helped with enjoying this in surround sound. Also, I know it&#039;s taboo, but I would recommend watching this in English, as it is the intended language and the character models are lip synced to English.<br />
<br />
Before I end it, I would like to take the time to mention that it&#039;s sad how hard this show got review bombed by the ass mad fan base. It&#039;s not like the video game by Capcom was a golden standard of story telling or had incredibly memorable characters. In fact, I&#039;d say this show did the characters just as well, if not better than the game. Also, it&#039;s silly to say it didn&#039;t do the game justice when actually it did. [SPOILERS] The whole point of the story is that it&#039;s circular, sometimes the arisen falters, and another dragon comes. This story can be interpreted as just ONE of those cycles. I thought this would be something the fans would pick up right away and appreciate, clearly not. <br />
<br />
In conclusion, this show is a solid 7/10, if you&#039;re pushing it, mayyyybe a 6. I gave it an 8 because I thought it was very enjoyable and just to show it some much deserved love. If you&#039;re in the mood for very simple medieval fantasy action anime, please don&#039;t listen to the fans and give it a watch.<br />

    Dragon&#039;s Dogma (2020)<br />
<br />
For a game adaptation, it does really make me feel the game may have been a bit dull if it was anything like this since although the show is great in some ways the storyline is just a bit meh. <br />
<br />
The story is extremely linear and it is like every time you try to deviate the character is almost forced back onto the path. Also going from hunter to better than a Witcher in 7 episodes is odd right? A lot of time must have been skipped here surely. <br />
<br />
The art is absolutely superb in the opening credits since it was spectacular. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review364464">
        rest of the animation is a bit of a duller CGI. It is a shame that they didn&#039;t follow suit with the rest of the animation style. CGI is coming a long way forward but unlike some shows like the High Score Girl franchise, this show isn&#039;t quite there. The CGI is mostly very fluid and highly detailed however so it is coming along. <br />
<br />
The OP is awesome. The rest of the sounds lack mostly depth but otherwise are pretty standard. English voices felt a bit off whereas I then watched it in Japanese that felt much better. <br />
<br />
Characters develop only in as much as the main character levels up and some people go through horrific ordeals. You even get as an example people being heavily cheated on with the whole but I still love them which is reciprocated by the cheater. A harsh world setting it seems. <br />
<br />
Overall, it is pretty average. They should have tried to make it all using the styling of the OP other than that should have left it as a game if they couldn&#039;t do so. It had a lot of potentials but it is a shame it is no more than an average take. <br />
<br />
7/10.

    I find myself mesmerized by CG anime. I know that&#039;s not a common sentiment, but I seriously enjoy it. The models have a certain look , style, and level of detail that often makes them visually appealing.<br />
<br />
That is Dragon&#039;s Dogma&#039;s best strength in essence, it&#039;s animation quality is some of the best in terms of CG anime, though you can probably find a similar quality from studio Sublimations other series, like the upcoming Shikizakura, which is looking pretty nice.<br />
<br />
Seriously any other decent to great looking CGI series, because Dragon&#039;s Dogma is lacking in strengths, and it&#039;s only great strength is the CGI. The series has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356809">
        good music, but the sound effects are just kind of okay. There&#039;s an overuse of the impact sound effect that Fate series tend to use. it&#039;s find, but sometimes it feels overused.<br />
<br />
I like the two main leads, Hannah and Ethan. They have clear arcs that are done pretty well, I feel like it could&#039;ve been done better, but it works well enough. The only thing as that the two leads are a bit too straight faced. There really isn&#039;t much of a dynamic, and there isn&#039;t much time to set it up.<br />
<br />
okay, this leads me to the structure of the series. naturally, it&#039;s an episodic series, every episode has an individual plot that ends in each episode. This can be done to great effect in series like Lupin the 3rd, or Little Witch Academia. <br />
<br />
The problem with DG is that each episode wants to make a point, and while some episodes kind of do this, the problem ends up being that you see how the resolution was made, but it feels like a few beats are mission. <br />
<br />
If some of these one offs were made into 2 parters, it might work out better, because as it stands the main pair don&#039;t have a dynamic and the plots are missing something to make it feel truly impactful.<br />
<br />
Some episodes also don&#039;t work because they need a rewrite. Without spoiling, episode 3 was awful. It was honestly distasteful, and the story just doesn&#039;t work because the foundation was poorly built. Which can be said for most of the series, as it wants to make a point, but because those episodic stories tantamount to making said point, it falls flat. <br />
<br />
Episode 3 is the one that kills it the most, along with 6, which only sort of wanted to make a point, but didn&#039;t because there wasn&#039;t much time. 5 felt rushed and 1 really didn&#039;t have much of point, which made sense, but in the end the series is now missing a point.<br />
<br />
Overall, the series just isn&#039;t worth it in the end, I recommend that you skip it, and search everywhere else for better CG offerings

    Never played the game, so I didn&#039;t know anything about this anime when I saw it. It was kinda rushed, only 7 episodes, could&#039;ve been better but still, I enjoyed it. I don&#039;t consider it a waste of time. The story could&#039;ve been expanded a little bit more, but it was from Netflix, you can&#039;t really expect good anime from Netflix. I kinda knew how the story would end, it&#039;s easy to figure it out, but even tho, I loved the ending, it was exactly what I expected, it was kinda moving. The art was nice, and so was the music. They could&#039;ve developed the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356494">
        characters better. Anyway, you should give it a try, is not that bad. Overall, I enjoyed it, so I gave it a 7, maybe they will try to create a remake and try to expand it better. I would love a proper remake.<br />
<br />
Peace out

    Before we begin, this review is based purely on Dragon&#039;s Dogma, the anime show, without any prior knowledge of the game.  I do believe that some people based this show based on what they know about the game, and I wanted to clear the air here - I have never played or even saw them before.<br />
<br />
Story: Dragon&#039;s Dogma is a Netflix, full CG series that released last year, worldwide.  It tells the story of Ethan, who has his heart stolen from him by a dragon, but ends up being revived.  Now called the &quot;Arisen&quot;, Ethan, along with his companion Hannah, must now

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409770">
        navigate the land in order to find the dragon that stole Ethan&#039;s heart.  On his journey, he faces fierce challenges, with each of the seven episodes being named after one of the seven deadly sins of man - wrath, gluttony, envy, sloth, greed, lust and pride.<br />
<br />
The setup to all of this is a little unremarkable, but I never go into a series and drop it if the setup is bad.  For this one?  It doesn&#039;t hold up all that well.  We&#039;re stuck viewing Ethan and Hannah through a storyline that amounts to: Ethan doesn&#039;t really have to help anyone who he meets on his way.  But does he?  Yes.  Why?  We&#039;re never really sure.  There are no story elements that make our characters make decisions.  He just want to get to this dragon... which he knows where it is.<br />
<br />
The way this series also ended was a little atrocious as well.  You&#039;ve watched this series... then you get to the ending and... that&#039;s all there is to show for it?  I really feel like this series had a goal... then ended when they couldn&#039;t think of anything creative to do with it.  At some point, you saw some fragments that could have led to a better ending, but they completely rejected it.  This series had an opportunity to create something very cool - we&#039;re in a very dark world where this fierce, seemingly unbeatable dragon claimed our protagonist&#039;s heart - and didn&#039;t use it to its advantage.  I didn&#039;t love the story, writing, or anything in between. (2/10)<br />
<br />
Characters: Our cast of characters weren&#039;t really expansive.<br />
<br />
Ethan: Ethan&#039;s a bit of a gentle soul at the start of the series and seems to work pretty hard.  This turns around real quick and after his heart was stolen, Ethan really turns to hate everything.  While this is fine... why was he off interacting with all these characters that he had no business with?  The way Hannah gets introduced into the series was actually fine, outside of why she did, but I feel like his character really lacked any sort of depth to it.<br />
<br />
Hannah: Hannah&#039;s essentially Ethan&#039;s traveling companion.  Her origins are pretty well hidden and her real only duty is to guide Ethan.  It&#039;s not super clear as to why, but acting as Ethan&#039;s second swordarm did provide some cool moments in actions scenes.  She does seem to have some form of character development, but it does come off as a bit of a surprise by the end time you hit the end.  She&#039;s mysterious, but I don&#039;t think I can go as far as to say she&#039;s a poor character.<br />
<br />
The Dragon: Never really given a name, Dragon steals Ethan&#039;s heart but... you&#039;re not really sure what this does to him.  I&#039;m not sure if this is a reference to the game or something, but to leave out the entire reason for this seven episode journey seems strange.  Dragon&#039;s not in every episode, but Ethan&#039;s fueling hate for him creates a storyline that&#039;s fine on the surprise, but very barebones underneath.<br />
<br />
There are some minor characters such as Olivia. Luis and a few characters Ethan meets along the way, that are at least a little appealing on their own, but don&#039;t really mesh into the story elements very well.  (6/10)<br />
<br />
Art: Being a full CG anime, you really have to content with elements such as clipping and making sure your action scenes look fine.  This did seem passable in a lot of moments but I wouldn&#039;t ever go as so far as to say it pushes the envelope in anyway.  Some of the spells that you get to see, for example, again, looked fine, but I feel like those are the moments that should have been cooler than they were.  (6/10)<br />
<br />
Sound: A nice nod was that the OST was done by the original game&#039;s composer, Tadayoshi Makino, and does an okay job here.  However, the voice cast was done really well.  Greg Chun (Ethan) impressed me here and this is at the top of his work in the limited exposure I&#039;ve had to him.  Equally impressive was Erica Mendez (Hannah) who puts in a strong performance here as well.  Christina Vee (Olivia) and David Lodge (Dragon) put in good performances too.  The side cast were actually strong here too so if it&#039;s one spot this show didn&#039;t falter, it was it&#039;s sound.  (8/10)<br />
<br />
Overall Enjoyment: I just couldn&#039;t find a way to enjoy this show.  Itr felt like there wasn&#039;t much that made it exciting and, after the second episode, you don&#039;t really get the sense that it&#039;ll lead to anything.  The story buries the show and even with a very good sound cast, the lack of depth in its characters doesn&#039;t do it any favours and the ending was very poor.  (4/10)

    Dragon&#039;s Dogma would like to talk in deep about the human nature, good and evil and many other moral themes, but it fails terribly at doing it.<br />
This is how I would summarize this anime in a few words.<br />
<br />
I played the game on which it is based years ago, and I enjoyed it, but the problem with the anime is not that it has just the premise in common with the game. The problem is that is very bad, starting from the bad CGI, the wooden animations and the generic character design. I don&#039;t expect all 3D animes to be like Dorohedoro or Beastars, but this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396573">
        looked really bad.<br />
The plot, in itself, is very simple: a dragon destroys a village and kills the pregnant wife and the adoptive son of the protagonist, Ethan, who swear vengeance against him. The dragon takes his heart away, until he will find him and take it back. For his journey, Ethan will be helped by a Pawn, a being with no will that will always help him no matter what. While traveling, they will meet several people who, somehow, are always victim of one of the seven deadly sins (no pun intended) and that show them the evil of humanity.<br />
<br />
But, how can someone fail at making something so simple? Well, that&#039;s a great question.<br />
If this was not the first anime, but the first work of fiction you have ever met, you could say that it is at least interesting. But this is made for a mature audience (it&#039;s 14+ in my country), even if someone have watched, say, Naruto, they would already seen better. Dragon&#039;s Dogma tries to talk about the way human hurt each other because of wrath, greed, gluttony and so on, and asks you how can we continue to enjoy being human if there is such evilness. The problem is that not only it doesn&#039;t answer this question, but gives the spectator not much to think about it. 80% of what is shown in the series are terrible things people do to each other: if an alien saw this, they would think that we must be exterminated.<br />
<br />
But aside even from this, everything is very childish and rushed, with characters dying like idiots and without any pathos, or doing something evil (and stupid) only to give some meaning to the episode. And don&#039;t let me talk about its terrible ending.<br />
It&#039;s nearly astonishing that it tries so hard to be deep and meaningful, that it fails not only in this, but in every other aspect.

    If you intend to watch this show you really need to have a high resistance against bad cgi.<br />
The cgi is in fact so bad that is on par with Berserk 2016 and Overlord season III. <br />
The issue is that in this show everything is done via cgi and at the same time soooo badly done it&#039;s hard to endure.<br />
<br />
The facial motion of the characters, the animations while fighting/talking or just walking/running, - everything is at a niveau ~15 years ago. <br />
<br />
The Dragon/Cyclops animation reminds me in fact of ps2 prerendered cutscenes with 5-10 fps. <br />
The only good cgi part are the skeletons, dunno why but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356420">
        the animations for those are really good even when moving in a mob.<br />
<br />
If you can endure the cgi the actual show is at least interresting but if you havn&#039;t played the games it will be confusing because the whole show is rushed to a point that most things just make no sense at all and are never explained.<br />
<br />
<br />
The story intends to show you how the once &quot;pure&quot; and good hearted main character gets colder overtime while watching the cruelty of mankind<br />
and at some point just is completly indifferent to anything.<br />
<br />
There is just an huge issue and that is the 7 episode count. It just doesn&#039;t work at all because of a lack of focus(monster of the week episodes)<br />
and most of the development just happens offscreen and the viewers need to connect it by themselves.<br />
<br />
If you played the game you can enjoy it to some point, especially episode 7 has a few moments in it but reducing a 20-40 min multistage boss fight<br />
with lot of dialogue pre dlcs(with dlc gear you just skip trough stages and kill him in ~5minutes) into 10 minutes in the anime was maybe the wrong choice.<br />
<br />
It was not a bad anime at all but the cgi and lack of episodes or focus on the characters made it worse than it could&#039;ve been. <br />
<br />
Maybe that was the intention so that ppl will play the game instead? Dunno but anyways if you didn&#039;t play Dragons Dogma<br />
and are interrest after watching the anime I can only recommend playing the game. It&#039;s a different story but well done and even the cgi is way better. =P<br />
<br />
