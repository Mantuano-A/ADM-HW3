    I’ll be honest, I didn’t care about baseball at all going into this anime. I knew the rules of baseball and had seen a couple games before watching this anime, but I would not have even considered baseball a passing interest to me before starting Tamayomi. While I still am not entirely interested in watching nor playing actual baseball, it occurred to me while watching Tamayomi, baseball is the perfect sport for an anime to keep someone at the edge of their seat. The way baseball is structured with its three-strikes-and-you’re-out mechanic just makes it so easy for Tamayomi to build tension. Multiple times in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344174">
        Tamayomi a character is shown pitching or batting twice and we are introduced to their weaknesses during play. Then, there’s a pause on the third pitch that creates great tension: will the character overcome their previously shown weaknesses and arise victorious for their team or not? All Tamayomi needed to do was follow this model of creating tension through normal baseball play for the show to be entertaining, but for the show to truly stand out it needed to fit this mold with an amazing style, which it ultimately did not do.<br />
<br />
The Good: Tamayomi starts off slow to introduce us to the cast and all of their former play before they joined the high school baseball team. This is where I think the show might lose some people, because most of the characters have run-of-the-mill personalities on their own and none of the show’s Cute Girls Doing Cute Things moments particularly interested me. Upon watching the later episodes of the show however, I noticed that these early episodes are a critical foundation for the tension created in the moment-to-moment baseball play presented in the later episodes. Instead of wasting time introducing us to each player’s backstory as they play, the back stories were already given to us so we can infer just how meaningful each pitch, catch, or swing of the bat is to every player on the field. These character moments presented through baseball plays are reinforced by the comradery of the team on the field. Each character’s inner monologues and cheering on of their teammates are rewarding as a viewer because of the character backstories that were established early on. The high personal stakes of each baseball moment coupled with the tension-building formula I mentioned earlier makes for extremely dramatic baseball gameplay that is not in the least bit boring, which is very commendable with how much apathy I had for the sport going into the anime.<br />
<br />
The Bad: As I previously mentioned, none of the CGCDT moments really did anything for me, with one exception. At the end of most of the first five or six episodes, I was left thinking: “I could not give a single fuck about any of these characters.” The one character that did stand out to me was Yoshino, her love of the sport and everyone involved really sold me on the team as a whole and her encouraging messages given to the team during play help each game feel meaningful. As I said earlier though, these more forgettable moments in the early episodes are a necessary evil for making the baseball games later in the series more impactful, though the series probably could’ve done a better job of making me care about the characters as they’re being introduced.<br />
<br />
The Ugly: There’s no way around it, Tamayomi is an extremely ugly anime. With an unfortunate reliance on robotic, 3D animation for many important scenes and some poorly drawn faces on the characters appearing sporadically throughout the series, it is hard to say Tamayomi is anything except ugly. Though the art did get slightly better towards the end, the art is still the biggest thing holding this anime back from being great. As Tamayomi aired during the COVID-19 pandemic when many anime had production issues, bad art might be given a pass, but when every shot is so poorly drawn and animated that it becomes the focus and distracts from what’s actually happening, it’s too big of an issue for me to ignore when scoring.<br />
<br />
Verdict: Tamayomi starts off with forgettable character introductions but makes up for it with incredibly engaging baseball games later in the series whose characters’ love for baseball makes it easy to find enjoyment despite little interest in the sport itself. Though the baseball games are exciting, the awful art and animation hold the anime back from being something amazing.

    I feel like this show gets a bad rep all because it might look weird in parts, but also because it&#039;s a &#039;sports anime.&#039; Which doesn&#039;t make it bad in the slightest and here is why.<br />
<br />
The main characters that are introduced to us all have different and fitting backgrounds to explain a lot of things. From having a team that is not as passionate, to a team that is as passionate, maybe too passionate. Something that has effected our two main mains as they went to different schools and developed their own growth in baseball, which later impacted on them. Which I believe is great

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336627">
        character development for this show, and gives us reasons to root for said characters.<br />
<br />
Which also adds to the story, as I feel you cannot help but cheer for them and hope they do well. All the other cast are fun in their own way, and bring their own spark to the team with their personalities, from being massive baseball lovers, to rivalries. <br />
<br />
The art style is nice and appealing to look at. Colourful styles are always going to be like that, and for a show like this, it fits perfectly. A nice peaceful looking show. The same could be said for the music, with it&#039;s op being a nice tune.<br />
<br />
Tamayomi for sure isn&#039;t an amazing anime. But it&#039;s certainly a good show. Defo gonna keep watching, and hope you give it a chance too!

    As of last year I have become a big fan of sports anime! The passion, the drive to move on when your at your limit, the speeches about friendship/hardwork/not giving up, the budding friendship between team members, and just how amped it gets me to want to better myself like they do! <br />
<br />
A good sports anime can put my butt in gear fast!!!! <br />
<br />
Now, I say this with a heavy heart filled with disappointment, this anime sucks so fucking hard. The story is predictable which many sports anime are so that&#039;s fair. But the story is also very boring and doesn&#039;t hold a candle of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344193">
        passion compared to most sports anime. <br />
<br />
The characters are all one dimensional and just uninteresting to watch. They play their roles in the game but nothing leads me to care about one more than the other in any scenario. <br />
<br />
And then we talk about the animation. Awful 2-3 minute segments of them being in 3d for no reason occur every episode. Its just vile. One minute you have mediocre traditional anime and then the next you have this nasty 3d nonsense just out of the blue.  Its just bad.<br />
<br />
This anime was not for me at all and I will tell my friends to stay clear of it. Its just not worth someone&#039;s time. <br />
<br />

    It&#039;s time for baseball (again)! The Japanese baseball hype continues!<br />
Every year we see a new baseball anime, many will remember the anime &quot;Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine&quot; from Spring last year surely. If you already know it and liked that anime, you will also have fun watching Tamayomi.<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
You want to win in every sport. Winning is fun, but losing is also part of life. You have to learn from your mistakes.<br />
Baseball is played with nine people on the field, but there are more is involved than the nine players themselves. In &quot;Tamayomi&quot; we see a total of eleven girls (a coach + a supervisor) who aim

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344280">
        to win the championship. Many of the players already had a baseball past, but for school or private reasons this had to be put on hold. The &quot;Shin Koshigaya High School&quot;, where our girlteam has their home, had a strong baseball history, but it has been disbanded.<br />
With the help and cooperation, our two protagonists Yomi and Tamaki (anime name: Tamayomi) managed to create a new baseball team again. Together our girls have the goal to win the national championship. In addition to their strong ambition, we also see their extreme commitment to cooperation. In baseball you can only win as a team!<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS:<br />
You can feel the close friendship and solidarity of the characters. They have fun playing baseball together. Even if individual mistakes are made, the team stands behind them. They win together and they lose together. The development can also be seen well. Each of our girls wants to improve in baseball. They train hard with each other and also discover one or the other talent of the other person that they did not know before. The bond between our main protagonists Yomi and Tamaki is the most emphasized of all girls.<br />
<br />
ART:<br />
The point that many would probably want an improvement. It&#039;s not the typical CGDCT (Cute Girls Doing Cute Things) art style. The characters look adult-like and if you can them in one word: THICC. Yes, THICC is the right word to describe the style. It definitely has a different style than the normal one&#039;s. The different environments and colors are well expressed. The different flight curves of the baseballs are clearly visible.<br />
<br />
SOUND:<br />
The OP song gives you a sporty feeling as if it was cheering you on and saying: GIVE YOUR BEST AND WIN! It&#039;s fun to hear. The ED song also fits this sports anime. After a long and exhausting game, you want to end the day (preferably with a win, of course) in a comfy way. The music is perfect for this.<br />
In addition to the music, the flight noise of the balls is very convincing. In general, many of the small sound details were not neglected.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT:<br />
I had fun watching &quot;Hachigatsu&quot; last year, so this anime was definitely on my to-watch list. It is difficult for me to say which of those two is the better one. Each has its advantages and disadvantages.<br />
Although I personally have nothing to do with baseball, I was still interested in how a game works here. In Tamayomi we get a brief but detailed explanation of the rules. The will to win of our is extremely strong, tactics are used that every viewer hates, even if they comply with the rules. This point is what appeals to me most personally. WINNING!<br />
On the other hand, I have to honestly admit that the art style doesn&#039;t appeal to me so much, I would like to see it in a different way (not that THICC).<br />
<br />
In the end, everyone has to decide for themselves whether they like this anime or not. The criticism for this is understandable, but also positive aspects can be taken.<br />
<br />
Winning is an important part of sport, but you have to have fun too of course!

    I apologize to the MAL guidelines for the argument I had about their 4 episode rule, because this is a series that doesn&#039;t really get going until episode 4. The first three episodes are set up, gathering the team and such. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m perfectly fine with that honestly, as I have enjoyed every episode of this series, mostly in spite of its flaws, but that&#039;s a later problem. This is a standard baseball story about a baseball team, but with girls. The teams focus is less on macho rage, and more on supporting each other. They also try to have fun while still trying to win

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337521">
        the game, which is important I think.<br />
<br />
The characters aren&#039;t very deep, but this is just the beginning, some of them do have some hang ups, and have built relationships, though some could be expanded more upon, but sadly in the current anime climate you have to get to point as soon as possible. The characters due have their quirks and goals though, and that&#039;s nice. <br />
<br />
I like that when this series wants to, it&#039;s actually pretty exciting, I loved episode 4 in spite of some of it&#039;s issues.I&#039;m not going to spoil episode 4 beyond saying that it&#039;s the first practice game for the characters, and I think the game was really good, even if thee direction could&#039;ve been better.<br />
<br />
As for what&#039;s wrong with the series, the animation and direction are pretty bad. There are moments where it&#039;s like, that actually looked not bad, but then there are m moments with some of the worst CG models I&#039;ve seen in a while, or moments where the ball looks like a jpeg, and that&#039;s just sad.<br />
<br />
There are moments where I don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on, because this feels more written for someone who knows more about baseball terminology. I know the rules, I don&#039;t know all the little details. <br />
<br />
The characters also look really similar, so it can occasionally get a little confusing in the heat of battle, but that&#039;s the downside of having so many characters, you can&#039;t make everyone look super unique, well you actually can, see Princess Nine, Taisho Baseball Girls, and Cinderella Nine for reference, but Princess Nine was original, Taisho Baseball girls was based off of a light novel, and Cinderella Nine is based off of a phone game last I checked.<br />
<br />
Tamayomi was based off a manga, written and drawn by a relative newby and maybe a few assistants here and there. So of course the only major difference between most characters on the team is going to be their hair, and maybe their height, they weren&#039;t designed by a whole team like Princess Nine, allowed to have little details like Taisho, or given the freedom of designing for a game.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m forgiving of the terrible animation, because the studio at this point has mostly done short series with the exception of Frame Arms Girl, which was a collab, so I can forgive the lack in quality. It is a shame about the direction, as the director had worked on a few seasons of Major previously, so I&#039;m gonna subtract a point for that.<br />
<br />
Overall this is a fine series so far, really enjoyed what I&#039;ve seen so far, and will keep watching. I hope you can keep watching as well.<br />
<br />
Average score- 6.6<br />
rounded up score- 7<br />
Personal bias score- 9

    Being the first show to go out with a &quot;bang&quot; with *yet* another paltry season, I will say this: this formula has been done time and time again, and apparently Japan LOVES anything when it comes to sports, especially baseball (since it&#039;s the talking point of the Japanese that extends to its rich history). So when I sat down to watch this show for the first time...ohmygawd. The memories of watching Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine flashes me back to really average shows that don&#039;t make a ton of sense adapting into an anime (save for the Major franchise, which still IS the best representation for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344185">
        baseball anime of all time).<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong, I DO love any CGDCT series that have unique twists with their plot, but Tamayomi here...just proves that the only thing going for it is basically what Cinderella Nine had in its plot (just copy-pasted over): character development and traits that make each and every team member stand out in both skill and personality. Cinderella Nine had 9 members (it&#039;s in the name), and Tamayomi had 10 (because an extra player is always the best exposed-but-unwritten strategies against better-skilled opponents).<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I&#039;ll take this chance to just say that you&#039;ve never heard of Mountain Pukuichi before, she made short stories, albeit Yuri-ish ones (that&#039;s where the Tama x Yomi ship has been sailing, and since it&#039;s in the title name anyways that flexes the stand-out). But the outlier is scriptwriter Touko Machida, whose works have always been little hits and as much misses under her direction, and Tamayomi adds a +1 onto the &quot;miss&quot; section. To quote somebody: &quot;It feels like you&#039;ve watched nothing but you&#039;ve watched something.&quot;<br />
<br />
As I wonder to myself, if this was just a carbon copy of Cinderella Nine, how bad could it be? I mean, girls with thicc thighs and asses playing  baseball is a nice twist onto the overly male-sexualised preferred cast is always a visual treat. Oh, and also the various girlish teammates that are the &quot;same same but different&quot; cliché troupe that always are a fun twist to break off the monotonous feelings when baseball isn&#039;t the centerpiece. I reiterate again, all these aren&#039;t great, but aren&#039;t bad. And just for the record, please do away with make-believe characters that are always a chore to watch and sit through.<br />
<br />
And the derogatory award goes to studio A-CAT for making stale animation, and sprinkling in the poor artwork with 3DCG (which in defense, was overly repetitious, but not as bad as you might think, just mediocre). Definitely never have heard of this low-budget studio, but the works they churned out definitely spoke for themselves. It was a horrendous start (not to mention Episode 4&#039;s &quot;greatness&quot; of shoddy unchecked work done) that eventually was a &quot;sacrificial lamb&quot; to get to the end point. Point is, less action, less repeats, but with smeared mediocrity across the board.<br />
<br />
Sound-wise, it was pretty decent though. The OP was very meh, but I did like the ED from the baseball girls as a whole team together in unison, that was really nice. Not to mention the background music was filled with both easiness and tenacity when scenes are called for it. One of the better aspects of the show IMO.<br />
<br />
Despite this show being a turn-off, I&#039;d come out to say that while it was a nice relaxing watch, it&#039;s just plain-ish decent-to-poor. Maybe I should say that if you&#039;re a serious watcher, then this show is definitely not for you. But if you&#039;re looking for a show to just watch &quot;girls just wanna have fun&quot; antics, then I can recommend this...to just binge it one-way through and forget about it as soon as you&#039;re done.

    OK, I gave this such high ratings because it&#039;s a wholesome cute anime which is fun to watch, however perhaps it&#039;s also got to do with my background. I played in Little League, Pony Ball and High School ball so I know what it&#039;s like to have team mates become rivals because of where they live they get put into different divisions or go to different high schools. It happened throughout my young life so I get it, I love how they made a weak beginner team into one to be reckoned with and they&#039;ll only get better since they&#039;re so young, I&#039;m happy and

        sad that episode 12 is next week because I have to see it but it also is the end of the season, I hope it gets a 2nd season. BTW I&#039;ve only just started watching sports anime and I&#039;ve been having a blast doing so. xD

    &quot;Cute THICC THIGHED anime girls playing baseball!? Sign me up!&quot;, you say to yourself as you start to watch this show. Unfortunately, it doesn&#039;t take long into the show to realize how naïve you were. This is yet another &quot;cute girls do ___&quot;, but instead of driving tanks or designing video games, they play baseball. Well, let&#039;s use &quot;play&quot; a bit loosely here. They don&#039;t actually play a real game until later in the season so before then it is just them practicing, reliving middle school baseball nightmares, trying to get new girls to join, and of course, doing high school girl stuff. This sounds

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336876">
        like I hate the genre, but that&#039;s untrue. I enjoy cute girls doing cute things because I can just relax and turn my brain off after a long day at work.<br />
So what&#039;s wrong?<br />
<br />
There are two main things that derail the potential of the show. The first is the animation quality. It&#039;s bad, like *ruins the whole show bad*. Lots of gross CGI that appears out of nowhere. Sometimes the girls will be merely tossing a baseball up for a batter to practice hitting and you see some weird cream orb float across the screen until it is hit, then disappearing. Occasionally girls will be shown out in the field playing as their 2D selves then suddenly appear 3D, then switch back. The 2D animation isn&#039;t any better, unfortunately. The girls look roughly edged, their facial emotions are basic, and physical movements are crude.<br />
The second is the execution of the plot.  Not the plot itself, although it is generic and predictable, but rather how the plot is portrayed. Instead of showing a nice progression of action, the show instead drags its 22 minutes of screen time out by focusing too much on past flashbacks, or the girls admiring their &quot;baseball worthy&quot; physical features, or talking about other girls high school baseball players and teams at random times in between training and playing.  It throws off the tone of the scenes and disrupts the action.<br />
<br />
Now for the positive stuff:<br />
I can&#039;t complain too much about the sound. There are some weird sound effects but the music is decent and the girl&#039;s voice actors do a good job. <br />
The characters are a bit bland but each one has a bit of a unique personality and skill that helps to make them stand out amongst each other. Of course, many of them have some OTHER nice features about them as well. Don&#039;t expect me to remember their names, however. <br />
<br />
I&#039;d say if you&#039;re simply a cute girls addict who with smoke whatever stuff you find as long as it gets you high, you&#039;ll enjoy this show. If you really like baseball, you&#039;ll probably find this show annoying to watch. If your &quot;Plan to Watch&quot; list is empty and you need something to drown out in, you&#039;ll probably find this show at least alright in terms of enjoyment. Overall, 5/10 as of EP 4, not worth finishing because I simply can&#039;t justify devoting any more time to it.

    It was an interesting mix of sports anime and wholesome anime. I liked how the suspenseful moments were present but not overdone and how quickly the story progressed. <br />
I like having a mc that is strong and has confidence in their abilities. She doesn&#039;t get stressed out and plays for fun, which is rare in sports anime. Usually they are either anxious or when they are confident they mess up; so it is refreshing to see something different. I hope this how gets positive praise because while it is a lower budget anime it still has heart.   <br />
<br />
The show is a short watch

        that has a nice plot that doesn&#039;t end on a cliffhanger but still creates and opportunity for a second season. I had fun watching it. I don&#039;t have high hopes but it would like to see a season 2.

    It Is Distressing To Be Pro<br />
Yomi Takeda was a pro pitcher of her school&#039;s team in junior high. However, she was the only ace in her club and other club&#039;s players could never catch up with Yomi, hence Yomi quits baseball, graduates from junior high and enrolls in Shin Koshigaya High School. At Shin Koshigaya, Yomi meets her childhood friend Tamaki, who is also a skilled baseball player, as well as a catcher that has the needed talent to pick Yomi&#039;s strongest ball. Together, the two can finally fulfill their childhood promise and start their baseball journey once again.<br />
<br />
Cute Girls Doing Cute Things<br />
There are sports

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344171">
        series that focus seriously on the sport, they use the sport to develop the story, or build up the tension for the viewer and there are also sport series that are basically cute girls doing cute things. And as you might have already understood it, Tamayomi is exactly cute girls doing cute things type of the anime. And the good thing about that is that the series does not try to hide what it is trying to be, it never gives any hints that this series is going to be somehow similar to Major, or One Outs. The story makes sense overall, but the only problem is that it lacks uniqueness, something as small as a grain that would make this series more memorable.<br />
<br />
Animation and OST<br />
Animation wise it is absolutely fine. The animators pay attention to how players&#039; uniforms should look like, background also looks fine, as well as the fact that all characters look different. Another thing I just cannot ignore is the girls&#039; legs, their height and their legs somewhat do not match, to say the least. But well, I guess this is how the manga creator sees it, so it is fine. The OST also does its job, making this series what it is: cute girls doing cute things.<br />
<br />
Characters Could Have Been Better<br />
All characters do show some signs of development, their backstories, as well as dreams are shown well. They never are annoying, they give a laid back feel to the viewer and never fail to be what they are. However, just like with the story, the characters suffer from flatness, their flashbacks are sometimes too random, the dialogues are just boring, which makes the characters average. It is not the level, they are so bad that this series is horrible and unwatchable, they are neither good, nor bad, they are just &#039;fine&#039;.<br />
<br />
Tamayomi: The Baseball Girls Manages To Be What It Is<br />
The series does have some fan service, but it is not overused, like some series do it. The storyline, as well as the characters are fine, but there is nothing unique and interesting about them. Do not expect something similar to One Outs, this series, as it has been mentioned many times in my review, is about cute girls, doing cute things. It is just that monotonous SoL that is okay to watch from time to time, but when you try to marathon it, you will hate it, hence I recommend you to watch this series little by little, if cute girls doing cute things is what you are looking for, if not, avoid this series.

    Let me try to give this anime some understanding.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed it quite a bit. I enjoyed the characters save for the very few either less interesting or underdeveloped (some minor characters are a standout), the moments between them and mostly, yes, enjoyed the way the anime looked.<br />
<br />
The art isn&#039;t bad. I suppose it&#039;s hard to satisfy with it&#039;s reliance on cost and time-cutting measures, but it does set a high bar at times, the characters are well portrayed and the movement during the games is sometimes excellent. Yes at times it&#039;s nauseating, but let&#039;s just keep in mind the very good possibility the comittee didn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review353567">
        get to fully complete what they set out to do on schedule due to unsuspecting circumstances. It&#039;s a shame, but I tried hard to make it detract as less as possible and it worked. I enjoyed the good, and I think there&#039;s lot of it that&#039;s good about this anime despite.<br />
<br />
For people who like baseball, enjoy, the game is portrayed well, the POV team&#039;s strategist is one of the leads (and the more likeable characters) and there isn&#039;t any bore with high-level tactics or babble. The sport is taken serious. For yuri fans, enjoy, there&#039;s many nice moments but keep in mind this anime sets up more serious relationships, doesn&#039;t deal with them. (and the payoffs are small and much later in) And generally for those who like giving overlooked anime a fighting chance, by all means enjoy!<br />
<br />
P.S.   Among my favorite characters are those who appear later on, on the team which are the POV team&#039;s main rival, and later on are also some of the show&#039;s best moments and also much less reliance on cost and time-cutting 3D animation. So if you give it a chance, do mind you&#039;ll be missing a whole lot of potential hooks without watching this anime through.

    Tamayomi ended being my favorite anime for the spring season. Tamayomi became famous for what happened with episode 4 when the studio was affected by Covid-19 and turned in an uncompleted episode for broadcast. This was later fixed with a re-release but maybe the damage was done, which was a great pity because this was a pretty decent show overall. There were a couple of episodes where the animation showed problems again but not to the level of the infamous episode four. The more the story progressed the more baseball it became, culminating of course with the big deciding game. This is a show about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review348657">
        girls playing baseball and the character development that happens is all about their development in the sport - with one surprise exception, but I will say no more about that! The animation style is simple yet economical and while the characters have a moe feel, they also have realistic builds for dedicated athletes - all the girls bar one have extensive baseball experience of one kind or another. Nor are any of them conventionally moe pretty (bar one girl with a cute moe fang). The other thing to note is none of these girls have major personal or social problems outside the game - they are all pretty normal kids really. This allows the story to focus on its central premise, which is baseball. I for one was thankful for that.,<br />
<br />
<br />
Tamayomi also has a good pedigree behind it - Its director also directed a number of series of the &quot;Major&quot; franchise and thus has a good understanding of what a good baseball story requires. Jun Maeda (Angel Beats, Charlotte) was responsible for the OP and Ed themes and they both combine with the OP and ED animation very well, particularly so in the case of the OP.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is when we get to the later episodes that Tamayomi&#039;s story takes off with some exciting and tense baseball action and where the earlier character expositions pay off.<br />
<br />
<br />
In short if you can get past the recurring animation flaws (particularly with the CGI), you will be treated to a pretty fine baseball story told well. I hope it gets a second series because the Shin Koshigaya story is far from over at this point.

    Story 6/10<br />
<br />
A simple cute girls doing cute things show the main characters Tamaki and Yomi are childhood friends who were separated in middle school but come together again at their new high school Shin Koshigaya a school which no longer has a baseball team due to a past scandal despite this the two friends who had loved played catch together in the past are happy to be reunited after difficult experiences in middle school which had taken the enjoyment of baseball away from them.<br />
<br />
After other students spot them playing catch other students begin to show interest and a baseball team begins to be formed and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344245">
        finally when they have enough players for a team and with a goal of going to the nationals the girls of Shin Koshigaya can look forward to not just playing baseball together but to play with joy and happiness.<br />
<br />
Art 3/10<br />
<br />
The weakest aspect of this show the actual characters look ok even good in parts but unfortunately the animation itself is janky with terrible framerate especially in the last few episodes when the tournament begins.<br />
<br />
Sound 7/10<br />
<br />
Sound and music is good with the sort of voice acting that suit the characters and the tone of the show.<br />
<br />
Characters 7/10<br />
<br />
All the characters are cute and likable with all of them having their own personalities but coming together well as a team with the main characters being the most notable especially Yomi who is always so bright and bubbly.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 7/10<br />
<br />
Nothing special but this a fun little show which I found entertaining and never failed to bring a smile to my face.<br />
<br />
Overall 6/10 <br />

    Ok, after experiencing some of the nastiest lock-down during this Covid-19 pandemic, I couldn&#039;t careless as to the quality of this anime, basically what we have here is an anime that was adapted from the manga called &quot;Tamayomi&quot; which basically means &quot;Baseball poem recitation&quot; by IMAO this was more like taken from the 2 main characters  of this series whom were TAMAki Yamazaki and YOMI Takeda put the first four syllables from the character&#039;s names and we have &quot;Tamayomi&quot; which is a sports genre series which was more like a chore watching it than anything else , cu&#039;z frankly , this works by original

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344155">
        creator &quot;Mountain Pukuichi&quot; who ever he is wasn&#039;t making any successful works. If one was to look at his or her creation one would find a lotta yuri in it and even thought this series doesn&#039;t have any yuri in it, it was more like  suggestive form so what gives about this anime/manga?<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s how:<br />
<br />
Story- Poor 3: Cu&#039;z despite of it being a sport themed anime everything about it was more like a force drama when two 1st years students  in Shin Koshigaya  High School decides to revived a club that was due for disbandment when it fails to get more recruits and it&#039;s up to a couple of  baseball wannabe&#039;s to get up and running in which they do......But the problem here was the flow where is runs sooo steadily  that one would look at it as more  like a chore cu&#039;z it was just  soo boring and the whole plot was more on the two characters Tamaki and Yomi relationship. <br />
<br />
Art-Good 7: It may not have any fan services that them doggies would howl for , but just the uniform alone whether the school uniform or the baseball uniform were the stars around here. However, the character illustration, welp that part was were it wasn&#039;t uniform, cu&#039;z there were illustrations that make the characters have masculine features, and there were angles that basically make each character too identical that one would wonder if that is still the same character. <br />
<br />
Sound-Good 7: That was for the opening and the closing cu&#039;z both were a good fit for the anime.  <br />
<br />
Character- Poor 3: Given that this anime has an entire baseball team as the cast, the problem was squeezing each and everyone of them to have each of their aired time, that simply make this way too complex given that all of them were regulated as  tritagonist more of it were on Tamaki and Yomi as the protagonists whom thought it wasn;t metion were more like a yuri couple than anything else , Yoshino and Ibuki as the  deuteragonist  whom were regulated as the supports with only Nakata shouldering all the antagonist responsibility.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-Poor 3: Cu&#039;z it kinda feels like that I have to watch it when I could&#039;ve have just dropped it...stupid me. <br />
<br />
Overall-Poor 3: Strike three and this is out...season 2????? Foul Ball!!!!!!  <br />
<br />

    Before I begin, I should put out a disclaimer that I do not play or watch baseball at all or am completely familiar with its rules. That said, I believe that if a show is good, it means it&#039;s good even if you are unfamiliar with its content. After all, aren&#039;t sports anime about the hot-blooded action, the thrill of a near miss, or the catharsis of a narrowly won game in spite of the odds?<br />
<br />
Well, Tamayomi isn&#039;t like many sports anime, at least with regards to the shows I&#039;ve watched. It&#039;s the Sega Football Manager to EA&#039;s FIFA. Despite the name, the actual main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344236">
        character in this is Yoshino and her managerial strategies in leading Shin Koshigaya to victory, with statistics and probabilities and studying histories taken into account. Even Yomi&#039;s magic pitch is hardly used throughout the duration of the show. It&#039;s a surprisingly straight laced take on the genre and unfortunately, it makes for a very boring show if you&#039;re not familiar with baseball.<br />
<br />
The lack of character focus apart from Tamaki, Yomi, and Yoshino is to the show&#039;s detriment. I typically enjoy sports shows because of all the tropes and cliches and the heart-pounding chemistry behind it all. What&#039;s here is incredibly weak by comparison, and by and large most of the characters just blend into the background for me, and I&#039;d be hard-pressed to name all of them if given the task.<br />
<br />
I have to address the elephant in the room by now, and it&#039;s the artstyle and animation of the whole thing that really undermines the whole production. Faces consistently look off model somehow, never quite capturing the manga&#039;s style nor seeming quite right by any standards. The animation isn&#039;t particularly good most of the time, and the frequent use of 3DCG, some of which are improperly incorporated into the scene, brings me out of the action each time they appear. I should stress that I generally enjoy A-CAT&#039;s CG work in Frame Arms Girl and 1/6 Choukadou Girl, so one wonders if they would have done a better job if the whole anime was 3DCG with some exception as in those shows. The visual presentation is undoubtedly the show&#039;s weakest point.<br />
<br />
By far the most surprising thing for me was how much I actually enjoyed the BGM to the show. For an otherwise mediocre production, the BGM to the show is pretty good and has a nice VN feel to them. It wasn&#039;t until quite recently that I learn the music is mostly composed by the same team who usually does the Key novels, but it does explain how the BGM have been consistently good across the series.<br />
<br />
In the end, Kirara shows either fall into one of two ends of the spectrum. They are either incredible masterpieces without competition (as is the case with Hidamari Sketch, K-On, Yuru Camp or the like), or mediocre dull shows with nothing much to offer beyond cute girls (the vast majority of their catalogue). Tamayomi unfortunately falls into the latter. Even if the animation had been improved significantly, it doesn&#039;t change the fundamental issue with its source material in that it is dull. Perhaps you may get a kick out of it if you were a baseball fan, but I&#039;ll take Homer At The Bat over this any other day. <br />

    I&#039;ll be honest, I&#039;m not sure what makes this show work for me. This shows animation was very mediocre, and it felt like everything else was mediocre. Honestly, this show is carried by the characters, especially the two main ones. I&#039;m not going to make this review in depth, so I&#039;ll just summarize and say that this show is like a slice of life but you also really root for the characters, and I still remember when the show ended I was super hype. The ending was great, and there&#039;s just a charm that I can&#039;t explain. <br />
<br />
Such a great show

    Pros: Thicc Anime Girls, Actually Focused on Baseball, Only 1-Cour, Released During COVID-19 Pandemic<br />
<br />
Cons: Super Generic Story, Horrendous Art, Constant Reusing of Frames, Very Sleazy Fan-Service<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t often write reviews, but this one is simple enough. If you&#039;ve seen one baseball anime, then you&#039;ve pretty much seen them all, and Tamayomi is no exception. I watch my fair share of bad anime though, so this wasn&#039;t too painful.<br />
<br />
If you actually like baseball and enjoy thicc anime girls with thighs and big round asses, then you will probably have a good time here. If you are really looking for a truly good sports anime, then this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344222">
        will let you down.<br />
<br />
Tamayomi will constantly be compared to Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine, which was more or less the same premise, only released a year earlier. I actually enjoyed Tamayomi a bit more, but both were pretty awful.<br />
<br />
Two things really killed Tamayomi for me. The art was terrible. From the reuse of frames, to missing faces, to sheer laziness, it was just bad. The show tried to compensate with heavy fan-service.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s the second problem. The show went way overkill with its ass and crotch shots. There were some shots of the girls stretching that were super blatant. I enjoy some fan-service, but when it&#039;s overdone like this, it comes off as very sleazy. Especially when it involves high school girls.<br />
<br />
I pity anyone who took Tamayomi seriously. This was a sexualized baseball anime that you watch solely for the cute girls. If the show had been a bit more tasteful and maybe went a bit deeper on the story... it still would have been awful. But maybe not as awful?<br />
<br />
The story plays out exactly like you would expect. I won&#039;t &quot;spoil&quot; anything, but damn, you should already know what happens here. Again, the story only exists here as an excuse to draw some thicc anime girls wearing baseball uniforms.<br />
<br />
Credit where credit is due, Studio A-Cat completed Tamayomi during the serious global health pandemic, while a lot of other shows dropped off entirely. This gave me something to mindlessly watch, and that&#039;s more than I can say for many other series.<br />
<br />
But the awful art, lackluster story, and overall sleaziness all leave a very bad taste in my mouth. I give Tamayomi a 3 out of 10. I&#039;d say only watch if you have a thing for anime girls in uniform or thicc anime girls in general, or if you really like generic baseball anime. But for most anime fans, this won&#039;t cut it.

    Tamayomi is an anime that aired a decade too late. Its style is similar to old anime from the early 2000s, but that&#039;s not really a bad thing. The use of 3D animation was a big turn off but once I turned off my brain, it was the perfect weekly source of entertainment! <br />
<br />
This anime has an interesting cast which I enjoyed a lot! Each character is memorable and it felt more down to earth compared to the cast of Cinderella Nine. The animation is lacking and the story was weak but honestly during this quarantine lockdown, I had nothing to look forward to so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344152">
        Tamayomi gave me a reason to wake up and live. :D<br />
<br />
Overall, girls + baseball is awesome. Best anime of the season because everything else I&#039;m watching is on hiatus. 5/10 but 10/10 in my heart! <br />
<br />
At least Tamayomi had a better story than The Last of Us 2. Defiantly worth $100 for the Blu-ray imo. Thanks to that game, I&#039;ve realized tamayomi deserved a higher score.
