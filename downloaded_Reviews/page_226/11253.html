    Let me go straight to the point. I like boobs. What guy doesn&#039;t like boobs. I also like fanservice and I believe that the ecchi genre has a lot of things going for like character development. However, the fanservice has been used too much and excessively to the point that it was disgusting and repulsive.  <br />
<br />
STORY (1):<br />
<br />
Right now, I am currently down in the weather because of the haze in my country. But let&#039;s cut straight to the point. Bikini Warriors is basically a fetish anime with boobies giggle, asses wiggle while my eyes shrivel and my IQ dwindles. <br />
<br />
The creators make every single

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199312">
        scene as sexually awkward as possible especially when it comes to the battles and constant focus on boobs and panties. In episode 3, the villagers don&#039;t mind the girls stealing their things and enjoying life in the spa until the villagers chase them out. When they are left without their clothes in the night, they just scream and moan awkwardly with no thought process <br />

The animation is completely stilted. There was barely any lip movement or physical movement especially from the other characters besides the girls.<br />
<br />
SOUND (1):<br />
<br />
The sound is completely non-existent. The ending felt just like a rip-off of another country national anthem. It felt like they put no effort whatsoever.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER (1):<br />
<br />
What is there to say? The characters are non-existent. They are just sex models. That&#039;s it. I barely remember any of the characters because I didn&#039;t care about this anime.<br />
<br />
CONCLUSION (1):<br />
<br />
People shit on Chaos Dragon &amp; Glasslip. At least Chaos Dragon had some decent fights and characters especially Glasslip. This anime has absolutely nothing to offer other than fanservice. However, it even fails as that. I would rather much see haze than watch this anime, it would be better entertainment. I would rather prefer to watch Chaos Dragon &amp; Glasslip over this anime. <br />
<br />
The only good thing I can say about this anime is that each episode is 5 minutes long at least the torture wasn&#039;t that long. This is by far one of the worst anime I have to watch in 2015.<br />
<br />
One person say that &quot;fanservice is generally part of the otaku culture&quot;. I understand but that does not excuse for the lack of character development and proper story to follow. I would rather prefer to see pictures or watch a hentai if I want to see boobs and panty shots.<br />
<br />
This is a fine example of why Japan keeps making anime just to show off the sexual fantasies of the creators and in the end nothing is learned and nothing is achieved and for that reason I have to give this anime a 1/10.

    Firstly, I would like to talk about the amazing plot of the story. I found it very interesting to have multiple female leads #feminism. Very progressive. Secondly, the animation was amazing, you can just tell the amount of hard work the animaters put into this amazing series. The blue haired girl, 10/10, the black girl 0/10, needs work, maybe a pigment change. That rope scene was a cinematic masterpiece, I absolutely loved it. This is way better then sh1t anime like monster, fmab, and hunterxhunter. I wish those writers took advice from this masterpiece. If you haven&#039;t already watched it, I suggest you watch it.

    Ah, Bikini Warriors, you should know exactly what you&#039;re getting into with that title alone. If the whole idea of erroneously under dressed women getting placed in the most sexually provocative scenarios surrounded by sexually charged allusions rustles your jimmies, avoid this anime like the plague.  <br />
<br />
Bikini Warriors grants us four main characters, all of which the creators were too lazy to name. Instead, we and everyone in the anime address the characters by their &quot;class.&quot; <br />
Fighter, a hot-spirited redhead that appears to lead the party keeps the other members true to their mission of helping save the world from all forms of peril.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199253">
        <br />
Mage, the closest thing to a loli in this anime and probably the fan favorite, uses magic to defeat her foes and protect her friends from danger that usually wants to enter their panties.<br />
Paladin, a blonde, busty beauty that doesn&#039;t seem to mind much when said danger enters her panties, also has a strange fetish for dying and being revived, for reasons I still can&#039;t comprehend. <br />
Dark Elf, because when Paladin isn&#039;t around being lewd or suggestive, she fills in her shoes quite nicely. <br />
<br />
If you haven&#039;t already surmised, Bikini Warriors takes place in an RPG setting featuring a small myriad of MMO and RPG elements, such as leveling up, treasure farming, boss battles, and of course, weaker or stronger (bikini) armor. If I wanted to sound ardent about this anime, I&#039;d call it an unparalleled satire of the RPG genre of video games, and while those are who are experienced in RPGs or video games in general might get a few chuckles or laughs from this anime, the clever puns and references will fly over most other people&#039;s heads. Admittingly, the ecchi is the biggest selling point of this anime, and with other stiff competition this season from Prison School and Monster Musume, Bikini Warriors just falls flat in comparison. And while the OST in Bikini Warriors was pretty underwhelming, the art and animation was surprisingly decent for something that probably didn&#039;t have that high a budget to begin with. <br />
<br />
One thing I certainly didn&#039;t like about this anime were the cliffhangers, and not just any cliffhangers. Literally, almost every episode ends on a cliffhanger and NEVER gets resolved on the following episode; The anime just acts like nothing ever happened. This also means that Bikini Warriors is heavily, heavily episodic.  However, considering this anime was never meant to be taken seriously, especially with its 3-minute episode length, you can&#039;t really hold that big a knife to the studio&#039;s neck. <br />
<br />
So in the end, should you give Bikini Warriors a chance? If you&#039;re a male and an avid or former avid video game player, I&#039;d say  there&#039;s nothing wrong with at least trying it, more so since it won&#039;t waste too much of your time if you don&#039;t like it. For everyone else, approach with extreme caution. Personally, I had fun time watching Bikini Warriors for everything it was worth and I might even consider watching it again someday --- totally not just for Mage or anything ~ <br />
<br />
UPDATE: I finally got around to watching the &quot;sequel&quot; special episode. <br />
No, it&#039;s not a sequel; It&#039;s a fan service episode, and probably one of the ecchiest things you&#039;ll ever see. Did this make the series any better or worse? No, because the series was already episodic anyway and ecchi is not something this show is new to. But if you liked the show at all, you should probably give this a watch.

    This is a pure comedic, ecchi four minute extravaganza. To expect character development other than skin revelation is pure fantasy on the part of haters.<br />
<br />
I have watched EVERY episode and never felt obligated to place any rules of any kind in reviewing this fun, bawdy, irreverently sarcastic show. <br />
<br />
Seriously, this is naughty comedy. Does anyone really want more from this show other than boobs, butts and shallow dialogue? I laughed my ass off just taking the awesomely paced in-your-face sheer (hmm really) attitude the creators threw down. Take that feminazis! Many newcomers to anime have no clue how it ALL began. Sigh. One could go

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203270">
        on. Never mind.<br />
<br />
Being an ecchi fan from the beginning of my anime life, this mini-anime brings back memories and fills them with renewed energy. Animation is the groundwork of any anime, story supports art.  Animating human movement is key to bringing characters to life. Adding humor to ecchi is not easily done well. I laughed quite a bit watching EVERY episode, despite the occasional ghost. <br />
<br />
Story is weak, for sure a bit disjointed. So what! Ecchi rocks the anime world no matter what the drama (miserable) queens say. Beats squeaky-voiced high-school dramadies that go on and on for endless no ends.<br />
<br />
Done here. Woohooo Warriors in Bikinis!<br />

    &quot;It is the privilege of heroes to search inside treasure chests and villagers homes and take what they need for their journey... so we&#039;ll just be going through your stuff.&quot; -Fighter<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not a Bikini if it&#039;s armor, right?<br />
 <br />
Bikini Warriors... man was I ever wrong about this series. I was right, but so, so wrong. When I first saw the title art on the upcoming series, I had immediately and unabashedly &#039;bashed&#039; this series as that odious, shameless cash grab for that all powerful ecchi market that permeates anime these days. <br />
<br />
However, let me be the first to admit that Bikini Warriors is a much

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199242">
        more clever anime than it EVER deserved to be. <br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
See, Bikini Warriors is both exactly what you&#039;d expect from a show with women&#039;s swimwear in the name, and completely the opposite as well. As a concept, this is not new- but what it does do is bring just enough self awareness to make you not feel like you need a shower immediately after watching. It actually does have genuinely funny moments- and in a show that runs 5 minutes, start to finish, something entertaining has to happen- and it does. <br />
<br />
Bikini Warriors&#039; humor consists of various MMO (and video game culture in general) jokes, like the ubiquitous fetch quests for useless items, raiding and grinding dungeons for loot, only to get useless crap or something you already have, and the kicker- the Armor Dealer sells them armor that looks exactly the same as their underwear, BUT IT&#039;S MAGIC DEFENSIVE ARMOR! Because everyone knows female characters need armor, but not on the boobs or butt. <br />
<br />
The heroes steal from the townspoeple because... well, they&#039;re the heroes. They break in and announce themselves, and like the brainless NPCS they are, the townspeople don&#039;t even notice their homes and clay pots being ransacked, and completely don&#039;t care. <br />
<br />
---<br />
&quot;We&#039;re the heroes, and as such we invoke our right to confiscate items we need for our quest!&quot;<br />
---<br />
<br />
Of course, there&#039;s also the typical MMO dialogue garbage, that the heroines try desperately to skip through, but they need to be told for the millionth time that they &quot;already had the key inside themselves, they just had to discover it&quot;. The untimely betrayal... the self sacrifice... and the cliffhangers. Bikini Warriors manages to weave up every fantasy story trope into one very tight string. <br />
<br />
I discovered that Bikini Warriors wasn&#039;t just a stupid boob fest, too. Did it have it inside itself all along? <br />
Well, the short answer is no. There&#039;s still a ton of tentacles and nudity thrown up onto the screen in every episode. If it&#039;s not a chest full of eels, then it&#039;s a giant squid monster, or a pervy questgiver. Even these are lampshaded though- parodying typical boss monsters and whatnot, but it&#039;s still gross. <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Despite being bombarded by ecchi and fanservice laden shows every season, I&#039;m still no closer to being a fan of these kinds of shows, but I have to give Bikini Warriors credit: for a show I immediately pegged as being &quot;probably one of the stupidest, painful to watch things ever animated&quot;, I was incredibly surprised by the inclusion of some honest-to-goodness humor. Humor that made me laugh a little in spite of how awful this could have been. <br />

My favorite genre of video game is the RPG. “RPG” stands for “Role-Playing Game”, which is exactly as it sounds. You, the player, take on the role of a specific character to embark on a grand adventure unlike anything you have experienced before. The game might take on a third-person perspective where you control the hero – The Legend of Zelda, while not strictly an RPG, comes to mind – or a first-person perspective where you actually tailor the hero to your liking – Dark Souls is my jam in this category. Regardless, an RPG puts

          <span style="display: none;" id="review208552">
        you into the game, making the game less a game and more an experience.<br />
<br />
Bikini Warriors is an anime, not a game, but it centers on this RPG concept. The ending of the anime reminded me of Mass Effect, a famous space-oriented RPG series. Doing all of the side missions, exhausting all possible dialogue options, exploring never-before-seen worlds. All wonderful parts to the game, but it was having my own personal character, my own personal story existing across the first, second, and third games, that made the series so special.<br />
<br />
I was invested in the series, so much so that when I finally witnessed the absurd ending of the third game I heavily latched onto the “Indoctrination Theory” that eerily, logically, and justifiably explained the insane leap the game had taken (I still contend to this day that that theory is the true solution). I was floored by what Mass Effect had done because it was not just a game to me, but my own, personalized experience that they had tampered with.<br />
<br />
While Bikini Warriors’ ending failed to influence me in any capacity, let alone to the level that Mass Effect’s had, the anime at least demonstrated that RPGs are rather peculiar in their construction.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Bikini Warriors is not a serious anime. At all. This is not just due to the focus on the “ecchi” content, but based on the fact that this is a parody. A parody of the elements that make up an RPG.<br />
<br />
Each episode has a specific trope in mind that many RPG enthusiasts can relate to. One episode targets the frustration of inept party members. Another episode is about the overabundant items one procures during travels. Another still demonstrates that, despite the heroes being heroes, they expect to get something out of the hard work they do. A lot of RPGs follow these same conventions, so Bikini Warriors pointing out how silly they are puts into perspective just how rampant such tropes have become. Although they are prevalent, Bikini Warriors poking fun at these universal traits is something that is known only to a niche market. This should be understood; someone who has never actually tried out an RPG before would miss out on many of the jokes.<br />
<br />
The “ecchi” content, on the other hand, is impossible to miss. Just as each episode focuses on a specific RPG trope, Bikini Warriors has each episode filled with sexual exploits. A tentacle-groping monster here, some breast fondling there. For the anime, placing the women in one perverted scenario after another is the norm. The majority of this sexual content, though, exists for pleasuring purposes that unfortunately take away from the RPG parody. Since RPGs are rarely explicit in their depictions of sex, seeing the women in bondage or having their panties yanked does not particularly fit the whole theme of the show. But the anime does have those moments where it combines the parody with the sex, making the “ecchi” content less directionless. For example, Mage opening a treasure chest trap that subsequently licks her breasts or Mage and the gang wearing bikinis at a fancy pool after stealing hordes of gold from the commoners’ houses both highlight instances where the sex is derived from the RPG elements that the show is parodying.<br />
<br />
To the show’s credit, the comedy and the sex are not all that is offered. More specifically, the anime can actually get quite clever with its writing. The best example is during the episode where the heroes are forced to do mundane tasks, like transporting goods or catching a dog, in order to continue their quest – yet another silly RPG trope. Yet it is the dialogue from Paladin that shines brightest. “I didn’t become a hero to move people’s junk.” “A hero should never stoop that low.” “Saving the good part for yourself.” In the moment, these lines seem natural, and they are. But when read more closely (and considering Paladin’s disposition) they are actually sexual innuendos. Bikini Warriors is, perhaps obviously, not always being so smart, but the anime at least demonstrates that it is more than just a small short featuring sexy women.<br />
<br />
Calling the anime short is apt; at four minutes per episode, there is not too much else that Bikini Warriors can realistically do. Focus on one subtopic of RPGs, have subtly witty dialogue, and show some Mage booty whenever possible. This is not a deep show, but given what the anime did do, Bikini Warriors did alright.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
<br />
The actual animation for Bikini Warriors is nothing impressive, but the reduced amount of time for each episode evidently helps the show to use more animation than is normally given for an anime of this caliber. If nothing else, the anime is adamant at making the breasts of the women bounce, meaning running, turning, and battle actions are used to achieve such movement. Other segments, like wiggling eels and an evil forest monster, keep the animation at a consistent level throughout the meager season.<br />
<br />
One of the better parts of the anime – at least, better than the animation – is the censoring. Similar to the occasional bits of dialogue, Bikini Warriors employs censoring that is clever. The anime blocks its sexual content, but it does so through careful positioning of its foreground or nearby objects. The episode where the group fights the aforementioned forest monster is particularly strong in this regard. Leaves and branches block the women as they bathe, but the best moment occurs when they are reading the nearby “Wanted” board. The board is filled with holes placed in a such a manner that it becomes difficult to tell whether or not the women behind are naked. Subsequently,Bikini Warriors mentions this, capitalizing on the censorship by making a joke out of the situation. Hence, both the sexual and comedic content is not hindered by the censoring but rather supported by it (where applicable).<br />
<br />
The rest of the art is surprisingly varied. Each episode takes place in a new locale – a local village, a creepy dungeon, and a mountainous territory, to name a few. Unfortunately, backgrounds are often lacking in detail, just enough provided to make the location recognizable. Having intricate art, though, is not necessarily needed for an anime that is barely forty minutes total in running time. Instead, the anime emphasizes the women, the framing of shots usually centered on them in a suggestive manner. A low-angled shot that peers underneath Warrior’s crotch or a full-body scanning as Mage happily bounces from side to side make up the majority of the anime’s focus. Given the show’s “ecchi” roots, this is a positive for Bikini Warriors.<br />
<br />
But perhaps the most important aspect under the conditions that Bikini Warriors puts itself are the character designs. Notably, the women all wear skimpy outfits despite the “warriors” moniker, but this is yet another jab at RPGs. RPGs usually have ludicrous female armor – “armor” is highly debatable – that aims to maximize sexual appeal. Thus, the lewd designs are yet another opportunity for the anime to parody its subject matter. At the same time, the designs themselves are entirely sexual. The women are scantily clad in robes, straps, and cloth that accentuate their figures, coinciding with the show’s “ecchi” content. While they each more or less look the same – pretty faces, large busts, ample figures – they each at least look like their respective roles.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
The ladies of Bikini Warriors are remarkably simple. Per usual, this is mainly due to the focus of the show – comedy and sex – and the total length of the season.<br />
<br />
Bikini Warriors takes a relatively common approach with its cast when it relies on contrast to characterize them. That is to say, Mage, Paladin, Warrior, and Dark Elf are the opposite of how they are normally portrayed in RPGs. Dark Elf is one of the easier to see. She is exotic and capable of wielding both physical and magical abilities. Despite these traits, she has the least amount of sexual scenes and the most amount of stupidity showcased, contrasting with her looks and elven origins. Paladin would seem to be a righteous woman, but she is in fact the most perverted out of the entire cast. She acts as if the sexual exploits bother her, but after some time, she speaks aloud how she really feels about the situation. Warrior is the leader – as is common in most RPG video games – but her inability to lead the group effectively would say otherwise. And as for Mage, while mages are often depicted as eccentric individuals, she is as timid and innocent as they come. Again, simple characterizations. But while not much, the parody continues in the characters themselves, boosting the anime’s level of execution in terms of its comedy.<br />
<br />
There is a bit more to the women of Bikini Warriors besides just their comedy. Part of what makes an RPG so fun besides the role-playing aspect is the chance to interact with the people nearby, and more specifically the people in one’s party. The members in the group are often “characters” of the figurative variety; they are decidedly different when compared to everyone else. The same is true in Bikini Warriors. Warrior is too gung-ho, Paladin acts suggestively, Dark Elf is overly confident, and Mage does not seem, at all, like someone who would be embarking on an adventure. But it is these very same quirks that bring them together, that make an RPG what it is. So while the women may be somewhat strange and they may not seem like the perfect group, from an RPG standpoint they were made for each other.<br />
<br />
Sadly, the women of Bikini Warriors have little else going for them. The debate is whether or not this is a negative when considering the composition of the anime. At the very least, the characters have no long-lasting impact. They are silly and sexy, no doubt. And there is the episode where the gang saves Paladin from the pervert, demonstrating the close bonds the four of them share. But because Mage, Paladin, Warrior, and Dark Elf are neither unique nor interesting, their silliness and sexiness is all they have, subsequently making them characters not worth remembering.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
Bikini Warriors foregoes an opening theme, a smart decision considering the short running time of the anime. However, a small ending theme is included. On the one hand, the song is triumphant in sound, akin to the victory music that plays during an RPG after a successful battle. There are also no lyrics in the ED, further increasing that feeling of victory. On the other hand, the piece is largely forgettable, mostly because the song lacks any sort of catchiness – the opposite of what victory music should be. The rest of the soundtrack is also reminiscent of video game-esque music. A docile village tune, a perilous dungeon ensemble, and so on. “Ecchi” content takes a different path, accompanied by an ambient track that sets the mood. Some do feel slightly out of place, however, such as a Hawaiian track meant for the sillier moments. Overall, the OST is a mixed offering with nothing noteworthy at hand.<br />
<br />
While the voice acting fares only slightly better than the ED and OST, the voices are definitely the highlight of the sound-work. Ai Kakuma as Mage uses quite the girly voice to make Mage that much cuter. Chiaki Takahashi as Dark Elf provides an older voice for the woman to coincide with her mature vibe. And Kana Ueda as Paladin also deserves a shout-out for her ability to make the perverted girl talk as sensual as possible.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
Truth be told, there is not a whole lot to say about this one.<br />
<br />
It is a small anime, meaning sitting down to watch it all in one sitting is a breeze (which also made re-watching scenes a cinch, too). What it comes down to, then, is whether or not the laughs-to-length ratio is met. For me, this ratio is met halfway. I chuckled at the jokes and the cleverness of it all, but I cannot say I was thoroughly laughing at the anime’s comedy. The “ecchi” content was also comedic in nature and not just pleasing to look at it, but since these moments mostly came down to some form of groping, repetition set in early. Still, there are some rather fun moments. Mage talking about how the shopkeepers will not buy one of their items because of its importance (a joke about the necessity for “quest specific” items that, if lost, would make the RPG unplayable) or Mage, Paladin, and Warrior getting scared over the fact that Dark Elf would not stop taunting the final boss (that is how normal people would react; the complete opposite of RPG heroes) were funny scenes to watch unfold.<br />
<br />
I would be lying if I said I was not looking forward to seeing this one and more specifically Valkyrie – one of the characters of the anime – in action. Although what I got was not Valkyrie. She was around for two episodes, and even then not the full time. So, understandably, I was peeved by not seeing her more. However, the anime provided an even better woman: Mage. She was cute, she was fun, and she was always a pleasure to see on-screen. Mage was easily one of the highlights from this short anime.<br />
<br />
As a last note, I want to emphasize an earlier point. This anime is “not for everyone”. This is not in a too mature, too violent, too open-minded sense. It is a too niche sense. I found amusement with this short anime because I could (indirectly) relate to the stigmas of RPGs. The jokes are not that esoteric, but their full effect can only be felt if the viewer has had experience playing RPGs before. Thus, this is not an anime for everyone.<br />
<br />
Bikini Warriors is short and simple. It does not do much of anything besides providing a nice laugh and a lewd shot every now and again, but that is all one really needs from a show featuring bikini-clad warrior women. At the very least, I would choose this anime over the ending to Mass Effect any day of the week.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Fine, parodies role-playing video games, with some witty dialogue, but the “ecchi” content often detracts from the main theme<br />
<br />
Animation: Fine, about average actual animation, clever censoring, competent background art, nice character designs<br />
<br />
Characters: Fine, Mage, Paladin, Warrior, and Dark Elf each parody their respective roles and represent the wackiness of an adventuring party, but lack any memorable qualities<br />
<br />
Sound: Fine, okay ED, okay OST, nice VA performances<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Fine, Mage was awesome, some funny moments every now and again, but the “ecchi” could get repetitive<br />
<br />
Final Score: 5/10

    I have to make this a longer review so I&#039;m going to try my best. My ally from another parental figure of the female gender, said ally being what mortals normally refer to as their &quot;friend&quot; of the male gender decided to that it would be an exquisite idea to write a stunning recount of this animation made in japan. He noted that it should be accounted as being 12 stars out of 10 because who doesn&#039;t love a bit of the good ole revealing flesh of the females.<br />
<br />
First of all is the story of the Japanese animation. It is fabulous. Four female warriors of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325289">
        different classes and race which show the breakdown of the patriarchy of the american population, where women are treated badly and paid less for their work (paid 10 gold coins which is worth about a potion to save the kingdom in episode 2). Which in hindsight is nothing like america. <br />
<br />
The art is beautiful, the people who animated this sure knew what they were doing, considering they made sure the breast scale was between beach ball and planet sized. You can see that a lot of hard work was put into the 4 minutes that each episode takes up. <br />
<br />
The sound is, what can I say, music to my ears. I mean, they used the same dub actor as a 12 year old girl in &quot;Teasing master takagi-san&quot; and it just worked with the character she acted, being of the cannonball sized mage.<br />
<br />
Even though each episode took up only 4 minutes, so much time was put into developing the main characters called &quot;Mage&quot;, &quot;Paladin&quot;, &quot;Fighter&quot; and &quot;Dark Elf&quot;. The characters design fit what the story was going for and are not oversized in the chest area at all. They all get fully &quot;fleshed&quot; out to the point where you can really relate with the characters on an emotional level. The names truly fit the quirks and characteristics of each of them.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed it; the sausage in my pants enjoyed it; my comrade to my side saying its a 12/10 clearly enjoyed it; and my parents enjoyed it when they joined us for the last episode at 3 in the morning. They left calling us &quot;Perverts&quot; which I think means that they love us.<br />
<br />
Overall? I think Bikini Warriors is definitely one for the top 10 anime of all time and if you disagree I will dropkick your Nan. This is definitely a family friendly anime and you should all watch it for Christmas whenever that would be. In all seriousness this is a satirical review and should not be taken seriously in any sense.

    I love booty and boobies, don’t you? Primarily when they cover most of the screen that makes you feel like you can touch them with your fingers, or your tongue if you’re that shameless like I am. When you see a title that is equally as shameless as the perverted little fellow inside of you like Bikini Warriors, your instinctive going into it will be about as what you would expect. Once you get rid of the bias of looking at it as a three minute short series and dumb fanservice, you’ll realize that Bikini Warriors has more to offer than just the latter.<br />
<br />
To describe

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200463">
        Bikini Warriors in a nutshell, it is a fanservice anime that makes fun of RPG tropes, specifically in JRPGs. The one other aspect that it makes fun of is itself — this where the charm of Bikini Warriors takes its form. Like much good ecchi anime whose sole purpose is to titillate its viewers, it does not try to take its gimmick too far into territory that contradicts its original tone. With a three minute episodic running time, any fanservice anime of Bikini Warriors&#039; caliber fits into this running time perfectly. If this were a 24-minute anime, or even a 12 minute short, the gimmick would’ve already reached its welcome by the 2nd episode. Three minutes is a long enough for Bikini Warrior to showcase its fanservice at a better pace to the point where there are not as many jokes that seem like filler to move the “plot” along.<br />
<br />
Many of the satirical jokes that come up are right on point with many mechanics and tropes that fans of RPGs love about RPGs, or sometimes get annoyed by them. One example of this is a joke that involves the girls selling off all of their items, healing or otherwise, to afford a powerful weapon to get through a dungeon, only to find another one in a random chest in that dungeon. There is usually one trope that is the center-focus of each episode, of which I won’t spoil the rest so that interested people will be surprised going into it. While there are a few episodes that do not hit the right notes on target, most of them are a riot if you are a fellow RPG fan like myself.<br />
<br />
Now we get to our lovely cast of voluptuous ladies who are about as two-dimensional as one could get from a story perspective. However, I can at least set aside this negative only a little based on how Bikini Warriors does its shtick without the attempt at being serious with its premise. Going one by one, the Fighter girl is probably my favorite of the four just from her gorgeous figure in that bikini and how funny her stubborn personality is by going through this fantasy RPG journey with her party members. The Mage girl is quite a fan favorite and is my 2nd favorite considering how hilariously emotional she is at any given scenario and how her cute bikini is the stuff of legends. The Dark Elf girl, surprisingly, is my least favorite of the bunch considering how forgettable most of her contributions are to the comedy compared to the others. And lastly is the Paladin girl who has her fair share of decent moments but not as memorable as the Fighter and Mage.<br />
<br />
To put into perspective the good and bad for Bikini Warriors&#039; art and animation, the art side of things is good but the animation is something left a lot to be desired. The character designs of the girls are quite sexy and great to the eyes, but it is quite obvious that the length of the anime is synonymous to the amount of budget they spent on it. Many shots involve characters just standing around with their mouths moving to lip-sync the dialogue. What’s even more hilarious is how they always skip towards the tail end of a boss fight so they wouldn’t have to animate as much. I realize that three-minute shorts aren’t enough to facilitate this amount of animation, but at least make it look like you’re trying and not look lazy in the process of animating it. I like my boob and booty shakes to have some substance to them, thank you very much.<br />
<br />
The title itself, Bikini Warriors, will already be judged from just looking at the title alone. If you’re an ecchi connoisseur, like me, then your curiosity has already peaked by the time you’ve read it. Others will probably thumb their nose at just the thought that someone would make something this “shameless.” I will point out, as I’ve done before, that this can be a short series that someone who does not care for fanservice but loves RPGs will find something worthwhile for about 36 minutes of their lives. That is nearly as much time as watching one hentai video, so what have you got to lose?<br />
<br />
Grade: B-<br />

    I think to enjoy this series it&#039;s important to go in with an open mind. You should know what it is first. This isn&#039;t a good ecchi with character development like Freezing. These are four minute episodes that look to accomplish two goals. One. Give you shots of anime tits and ass with overflowing amounts of fan service. Two. To parody a RPG trope.<br />
<br />
The RPG trope parody is actually mildly amusing. If you play a lot of RPGs like the obvious Dragon Quest series it is directly parodying than you will enjoy it too. For instance one episode has them sell all their elixirs in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214550">
        order to buy a crystal staff. Upon getting further into a hard dungeon they could really use some elixirs to survive. They open the last chest and inside is a crystal staff. It&#039;s something most RPG players have been through. I certainly got a kick out of it. Especially with how short each episode it gets to the point rather quickly. However, this part of the show is hurt a lot by the shows other goal.<br />
<br />
Fan service. I am down for it. If while girls are fighting their boobs pop out I&#039;m cool. If a girl falls over into a provocative pose I&#039;m cool with it. However, the fan service in this show actual hurts it. While giving a lot of the dialogue the animation will just be centered on their boobs or ass. There was a fair amount of funny stuff going on that could have been accompanied by humorous animation, but instead they took a lazy route. However even in this way they are lazy. If you are going to have a girl sexed by giant tentacle monster than just make the girls naked. That&#039;s right. There is no nudity outside of an ass crack here and there. I just don&#039;t understand that decision to hold back in this way but not others.<br />
<br />
Bikini Warriors seems half baked. The parody stuff is entertaining, but the studio didn&#039;t seem confident that would be enough to appease people. Instead they threw in all this lazy fan service. I say watch it. The episodes are only four minutes and the show does have entertaining parts. Just be ready for an anime that could have been much better.

    It&#039;s an ecchi anime that makes fun of the standard jRpg&#039;s and the crystal (light) warriors cliche in games.This anime shouldnt be hardcore reviewed since it&#039;s probably made to give you a laughter while watching anime boobies.<br />
Story: 3/10<br />
-There&#039;s almost no story,it&#039;s more of a episodic theme where the girls fight a monster or are trying to get money,it kinda looks like they are trying to beat the demon king as the story main objective.<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
-The art is nothing special,not too good not too bad.<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
-Nice interpretation of the sound that wiggling boobies make.<br />
Character: 7/10<br />
-Mage girl is best girl or you&#039;re wrong.<br />
Enjoyment:8/10<br />
-As a fan of Final

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199309">
        Fantasy and other japanese RPG&#039;s I enjoyed all the stuff they made fun about,the crazy monsters,item drops,value of an elixir etc.<br />
Overall a 6/10 for me,since it&#039;s a 4minute episodic anime,i didnt go too harsh on it.If you&#039;re looking for an anime to finish (pun intended) under an hour,then here you go.<br />

    I am going to start off by saying there are adult films with better plot. I am just going to show summaries of each episode. I made notes while watching. <br />
<br />
Episode 1: Introduces characters and their &quot;Armor&quot; <br />
Episode 2: Unfair pay and eye burning Bondage. <br />
Episode 3: Shows us why the U.S&#039; s third amendment was made.<br />
Episode 4: Wholesome Mayor &quot;You will do anything? ;)&quot;  asks them to do chores. Then they fix Bestiality, aphrodisiacs, yuri, tentacles. My poor innocent eyes. Then the wholesome mayor gives a Wholesome speech.<br />
Episode 5: Their panties sell faster than Belle Delphine&#039;s bath water.<br />
Episode 6: Perfectly placed leaves and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313066">
        signages, and a Perverted slime Monster. <br />
            DARKNESS PLEASE GO BACK TO KONOSUBA!<br />
Episode 7: Flashback episode with a lot of tongue. We also see Stonehenge. <br />
Episode 8: New girls with accents. Valkyrie is hot TBH.   Yurification, the Gay representation we need. An OTP is born.<br />
Episode 9: OH NO, Darkness, you are a loli lover? <br />
              This episode was actual pretty good.<br />
Episode 10: Traps, and not the gay kind. if there were gay traps, this would of gotten a 5. <br />
Episode 11: Darkness X Major. No s*x before Marriage.<br />
Episode 12: I am at a lost for words. stay for the after credit scenes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Were the girls hot? At least, 50% of them.  No homo.<br />
Was there a plot? No<br />
Should I of started watching this? No<br />
Did it scar me for life? IDK, the end of episode 2 was wack.<br />
<br />
I am the opposite of this show&#039;s target audience. <br />

    As many guys would say ~BOOBIES!!!!!!~ <br />
<br />
Yes every person who is reading this review should understand that this anime contains Huge Boobs, and they all are wearing Armour similar to Bikini&#039;s and they are all hot. <br />
<br />
The anime story line sate&#039;s back to the old days when there were various beasts and dungeons, but don&#039;t worry the graphics of the anime are top notch as it is made by Funimation, Each episode is less than 5 mins long that would be one of the bad points and only 12 episodes are available, so yes Guys would only be able to enjoy it for a few

          <span style="display: none;" id="review211762">
        minutes. <br />
<br />
Coming to the characters, there is a Fighter, Mage, Paladin and Darkelf, these girls all wear bikini&#039;s as the anime name suggests and throughout the entire series they come across various adventures and struggles and yes i must say that the anime is definitely very Funny and you will enjoy watching it, The artwork and the character designs are really good( I recommend everyone one to download or watch it in 720P quality or even better 1080P) the figure designs have been made so accurately, Thanks for Funimation to making this possible<br />
<br />
The character voicing has also been done really well, it matches each and every character. <br />
<br />
Overall i recommend everyone to watch it and if anyone loves big boobs then you will definitely love this anime, I recommend 16+ age limit as there are some things that small kids may not be able to understand (You know what i mean ;-)

    So, as you might guess from looking at the poster, this anime is about warriors. In bikinis. Yes, it looks really dumb, and in many respects, it really is, but I feel most people don&#039;t really get what it&#039;s doing... Now i&#039;m not gonna sit here and try to tell you this anime has some sort of deep deep meaning, because it doesn&#039;t, but, there is a lot more to it than most people seem to give it credit for, fx. the whole reason for the name is a joke on the trope about female armor in PC RPG&#039;s, where it often seems like the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review208964">
        more skin they show, the higher level armor, and they do address that right in the first episode, and from there on out, every episode is a self contained little story, each dealing with various tropes and cliché&#039;s withing D&amp;D and PC RPG&#039;s, like that one episode where they &quot;invoke their right as heroes&quot; to go out and rob people blind for their belongings in their homes, and most of these jokes only really work if you are familiar either D&amp;D or PC RPG&#039;s, but as someone who has a lot of experience with both, I was laughing a good deal through most of it, and I&#039;d recommend it to anyone who also knows about these things, most other people most likely wont get it. Though I will admit, the fanservice can get a bit grading at times, when they&#039;re literally shoving boobs, asses and camel-toes right into your face for no reason at all. So other than that last point, I had a blast, and I didn&#039;t really expect it to have a story, so in my book, at overall pretty good!

    Bikini Warriors delivers exactly what it seems to deliver. Both in the obvious and not so obvious.<br />
<br />
First is the fanservice. Yes, every episode is full of it. It largely focuses on the breasts and butts of the heroines (?), the former bounce at every opportunity and images of them in lewd poses are very common. If you like such things, this anime already has a lot to offer to you.  If you don&#039;t care for it, you at least need a very high tolerance for such things.<br />
<br />
But the second aspect is the RPG parody. And I found myself enjoying that a lot more. Kleptomanic

          <span style="display: none;" id="review218766">
        heroes, lack of support from kings that sent you on quests and even player behavior, like selling potentially crucial healing items, are poked fun at and every fan of (J)RPGs will find familiar situations. If you like parodies like that, that aspect alone could make Bikini Warriors worth watching (if you have the aforementioned fanservice tolerance).<br />
<br />
However, aside from these two points, this anime doesn&#039;t really offer anything else. There&#039;s no actual story and every of the few plot elements are left pretty much open. And as with many RPG parodies, the main characters tend to act morally questionable and are pretty selfish. It&#039;s not a deal-breaker, as it&#039;s pure comedy and not meant to be taken seriously at all (and who would that expect from an anime called &quot;Bikini Warriors&quot;?).<br />
<br />
Its biggest strength is arguably its short length. It doesn&#039;t offer much, but with every episode just lasting 4 minutes, it doesn&#039;t overstay its welcome (and honestly, I&#039;d probably have never finished it, if it were much longer).<br />
<br />
Overall, if you dislike fanservice, it&#039;s better to avoid it. There&#039;s so much of it, it&#039;s impossible to ignore it. If you like RPG parodies, it could be worth taking a peek. If you like both, then this could might be very well-worth your time, especially since it doesn&#039;t take much of it.

    Hello people. For those who don&#039;t know I am Josh and I am here to review the anime that like Eiken is board line hentai. That&#039;s right folks. Today I am reviewing bikini warriors which is somehow surprisingly PG 13....Let&#039;s just get on with this.<br />
<br />
Story- ...The title is self explanatory. Like really. If your expecting anything but ecchi, fan service and board line hentai moments you are in the wrong place. I mean just reading the title can tell you what this is going to be.<br />
<br />
Anyway the show is set in an rpg type environment which was to a point. Mildly amusing at best. It

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220779">
        about 4 big breast girls doing...well pretty much what you do in RPG just with loads of fan service and ecchi moments. The show is episodic and is only 4 minutes long. Doesn&#039;t overstay it&#039;s welcome to a certain extent. You can just breeze past this in one day really. Personally I didn&#039;t find it to be that funny at all, it had it moments though that brought out a chuckle but that&#039;s it really. Another issue is the pointless cliff hangers which got annoying a little and were pointless since each episode was something entirely different and had nothing to do with those cliffhangers. Overall the story gets a 4/10. It wasn&#039;t God awful but it is bad.<br />
<br />
Art- Probably the only high point of this anime from me. The animation decent for what it is. I got no issue with the character designs that much really. Other than that my main issue is that they relied so much on panty and boob shots and tons of fan service moments to again make me wonder why MAL says this is a Pg-13 anime. Overall it gets a 5/10 I guess<br />
<br />
Sound- I usually would judge opening and endings but this anime didn&#039;t really have one so I&#039;ll avoid those. The voice acting was meh to me. It wasn&#039;t bad and it wasn&#039;t good either tbh. 4/10 is the overall score<br />
<br />
Characters- Just generic girls to a tee with big breast in this (Not Eiken level, so don&#039;t worry about that). A fighter, a Mage, a Palladian and a dark elf....I could assume and make jokes on why she is called that but I won&#039;t. These characters are just your basic things that you can be in rpg games just with big breast and a shit ton of fan service and board line porn moments<br />
<br />
Oh and if your wondering why I have said this characters names...they don&#039;t have any. Really I sh*t you not. The creators of this were so lazy, that they just named them Fighter, Mage, Paladian and Dark Elf..,you know...cause she black...and she&#039;s an elf...<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll just stop now.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- I pretty much knew what I was walking into and my expectations like for anything like this was extremely low as hell or just average. Overall this is just average enjoyment. 5/10<br />
<br />
Overall- Not the worst thing I&#039;ve seen, but far from good to. It not appalling of horrible but you have to have a sh*t ton of tolerance when you watch this anime. The comedy is bad and it mostly relies on the fan service and board line porn moments. Overall Bikini Warriors gets a 4/10

    Let&#039;s see if we can fit somewhere between &quot;feminist masterpiece&quot; and &quot;bad taste garbage&quot;.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Well, there is none. The show is episodic in nature and features short stories within its episodes, which are only 3 to 4 minutes long. Most of the time, they make fun of RPG tropes and stereotypes, somehow always leading to the girls getting ravished. As long as Bikini Warriors sticks to this concept, it works great. Unfortunately, they tried to have some episodes that carry themselves, which does not work very well. In general though, it&#039;s entertaining (if you&#039;re into mindless lewdness of course).<br />
7/10<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
It&#039;s not spectacular, but it&#039;s nice to look

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199976">
        at. The girls are busty &amp; bouncy and pretty. I believe that&#039;s all anybody cares for who watches this.<br />
7/10<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The voice acting is good, they fit all their respective characters. Of course you&#039;ll hear them moaning just as much as talking, so if you&#039;re into the porn sound, this is your cup of tea (once again, this is what people who watch this most likely want anyway). Sadly, Bikini Warriors has no intro and only a short outro.<br />
7/10<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
The whole show is not even an hour long, so it&#039;s hard to judge the characters. You have the hotheaded main girl who gets violated a lot, a cutie pie mage who gets violated a lot, a heroic horny paladin who tries her best to get violated as much as possible and the dark elf. I don&#039;t really understand the dark elf, what kind of character is she supposed to be? Sometimes she seems to be wise, other times she&#039;s an idiot. Well, for the little time they had, the characters are okay I guess.<br />
5/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
You will watch Bikini Warriors to get hard while getting a good laugh. The show definately succeeds in the first category, but it has its problems delivering the comedy part every now and then. Still, all episodes together are somewhere between 30 and 45 minutes, so you won&#039;t regret watching this anime even if you just find it okay.<br />
6/10<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
6.4/10

    Story(1) Art(6) Sound(4) Character(1) Enjoyment(2) Overall(3)<br />
<br />
An anime made to take the piss out of the frequent MMORPG oversexulization.<br />
Well. It does do that that&#039;s for damn sure.<br />
<br />
The story is looser then a fat man who just ate at chipotle and taco bell&#039; s stool.<br />
The characters are hot as f*** but they have no real character to them. <br />
They are all bimbo&#039;s with soft brains and overly bouncy breasts. <br />
<br />
And then they try to set it up like their could be a sequel. A sequel to what? A non existent story? <br />
<br />
I&#039;d say this would make for good fap material but even thats impossible cause the scenes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review248094">
        move too quickly.  Good art style. Not enough time on the scenes.<br />
<br />
All in all it&#039;s an hour long shitty version of a cock tease with very little merit to it as it&#039;s not sexy enough to make for a good fap, not good enough to care about the story and the only character that is memorable is the cute mage and thats mainly because shes an oppai loli in bondage gear so she sets off some fetishes for me.<br />

    Sometimes you just feel like watching a fucking weird series, one you wouldn&#039;t normally.  &quot;Bikini Warriors&quot; is one of my strangest selections.  It&#039;s an unabashed softcore porn series, a genre that has become popular in the past six years. I decided the gamble was worth it because of how short it was (12 episodes at 4 minutes each) and that it was ostensibly a comedy.  <br />
<br />
It exceeded my expectations.  It&#039;s a parody through and through, mocking conventions of JRPGs (particularly the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series, whose logo it mimics), similar softcore porn anime, and the general concept of attractive women fighting in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review212751">
        revealing clothing.  <br />
<br />
One episode notes how bizarre it is that one can loot villager&#039;s treasures in JRPGs without them noticing.  Another how bikini armor all looks the same, despite different stats, and inconceivably provides protection.  Another on deciding between new members of the party.  And so on.  <br />
<br />
None of this is remotely original, but it&#039;s pulled off well, presenting itself with a wink and a nod.  I found myself smirking frequently.  And with the short runtime, it&#039;s well-paced.  <br />
<br />
There is still plenty of softcore porn, but it never felt like it got in the way of the humor.  (Unlike the Special) The 12 episodes do run out of steam near the end.  There were about 8-10 episodes&#039; worth of amusing ideas, and the rest were only made to come in at the standard length.  <br />
<br />
Nevertheless, this is surprisingly enjoyable.

    I can only give you 4 reasons to watch this. <br />
Boobs, yuri, fan service and Mage.<br />
<br />
What else would you need in an anime like. I even gave a bonus reason that is Mage, honestly, she&#039;s the only character I actually like(probably the same for other people). Even the show itself suggested that she&#039;s the favorite. Plus she&#039;s voiced by Ai Kakuma who, you might or might not remember, voicing Sento Isuzu in Amagi Brilliant Park.<br />
Apart from those, the story is non existent, the characters are pretty flat and only exist for fan service. They do look good though.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re gonna watch it, I suggest getting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321762">
        the DVD or Blu-ray. That&#039;s double the enjoyment. We all know what enjoyment your look for in this kind of anime. The TV version just gonna give you blue balls.

    It is only 12 episodes at 4 minutes each so not much time investment.<br />
<br />
Bikini Warriors is definitely a lot of fan service but it was not as bad as I thought it would be.<br />
<br />
The premise of Bikini Warriors is to simply poke fun at the rpg genre of games, like how you are rewarded jack shit for doing difficult task or how you may spend hours looking for a item and then can just buy it from a npc if you talked to them.<br />
<br />
Ofc it has fanservice, quite a lot of it, so this is ok if you like that kind of stuff.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s worth a
