    Okay, so I usually don&#039;t write or rate any anime that I haven&#039;t finished yet, just because I feel it is unfair and I wouldn&#039;t have done it here either, but seeing the score while there is only one review out, I felt that it is necessary to give people a better understanding. Because I am not really able to rate a lot of the aspects of the show yet, I decided to not do a usual breakdown of the different categories, but I would just write a short text about why I think people might dislike it and why I think it is still

          <span style="display: none;" id="review378230">
        at least worth the watch.<br />
<br />
So let&#039;s begin with why I believe people might dislike the show. Gekidol is one of the shows that tries to trick you on the surface level about what it wants to be. For example, the title alone is a combination for the words theater and Idol and together with specific scenes in the first few episodes, the general idea that this is just an idol show in a theater is very reasonable. However, the show also shows a lot of hints that already reveal in the first episode that this is not the case and I believe this is a huge risk. Because people who expect an idol show will notice for example the strange atmosphere that is different from your usual happy idol show while people not expecting anything just assume this is about idols and leave. This can obviously work, one of the prime examples is Madoka Magicka, but even that show only blew up after everyone understood what it was really about and therefore started recommending it to people outside the Magical Girl fandom (note here: this is not to say that this show is on the same level, it is just a comparison).<br />
<br />
Now with that out of the way, what is the show about? I can&#039;t tell you 100% yet and I also can&#039;t tell you if the ideas presented in the first 5 episodes will be executed properly in the end. What I can tell you is that the show has a dark undertone which mostly comes from its subgenre SciFi. For example, there is a phenomenom where parts of the city just vanished and no one can explain why. At the same time, the world has technology that makes watching a theater a lot more enjoyable and which seems to have a hidden spec to it that is not yet revealed, since it is mainly owned by a large company. Add to all of that an android who seems to be able to act out (because it&#039;s a show about acting) the people the person loves the most and make you believe you are in the presence of this exact person again. This android again is owned by the same company and may or may not have developed feelings (again hard to tell yet, because main part of the show is acting).<br />
To summarize that: The story and world has a large mystery to it that could potentially evolve into some amazing climax in the later episode. Furthermore the combination of a happy surface level anime combined with this dark undertone makes it really exciting to watch, especially since some of the characters also show a more &quot;darker&quot; side to the whole idol job which is usually not mentioned very much. I can only tell you to try out the anime, because I feel a lot of people got the wrong impression from the first few episodes (even though the hints are already there).

    This show is a classic case of the &quot;golden rule&quot; of &quot;Show, don&#039;t Tell&quot; gone horribly wrong, and trying to salvage any further predicament will only harm your brain cells, much less your eyes. I know I did.<br />
<br />
But first, a crash course on &quot;Show, don&#039;t Tell&quot;:<br />
‘Show, don’t tell’ is a classic advice for writers – something like a ‘golden rule’, delivered with complete surety and an authoritative tone by the last generation of authors to the next. This ‘set in stone’ approach drives many authors to try and pick it apart, but it’s survived so long for a reason: it is good advice, most of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review385393">
        the time. Learning how to ‘show’, and when to do so, is an important skill to have as a writer, and perfecting it can mean the difference between rich, immersive writing and flat, dull prose.<br />
<br />
Now look at Gekidol. It shows us things, tells us things, but somehow it couldn&#039;t find the OOMPH factor to stay relevant, and proceed to butcher like it was nothing. If anything, I will say this now: SKIP this show and the &quot;Alice in Deadly School&quot; OVA tie-in, both shows are definitely NOT worth your time. And yes, you&#039;re not reading it wrong, those are extremely BOLD words of confidence.<br />
<br />
Lightning round for what this show is (but honestly I don&#039;t care):<br />
- A theater act disguised as a systematic approach to the postmortem setting, yet the BTS (behind-the-scenes) paints a graphic picture of confronting past mistakes and attempts to resolve whatever conflict that may come and fly by. SHIT.<br />
- A love story for the post-apocalyptic setting that just doesn&#039;t click up with even power fantasy terminologies, and only has them because it&#039;s a requirement in name only. SHIT.<br />
- Characters that are gathered together for the love of acting, but yet most character development is just as worse of the generic kind, from a large-girl cast of theater + idol (that&#039;s how you get Geki-dol by the Japanese Hiragana annotation) to emitting pure distasteful Yuri and fraudulent ass-pulls for friendship conflicts. SHIT.<br />
- For an idol show that calls itself &quot;Gekidol&quot;, music should be central, but it seems that the Gekijou theatre act is overplayed against the music being overshadowed for the most part. At least, the first OP was what I&#039;ve liked at the start, but that&#039;s about it. SHIT.<br />
- Getting some of the worst low-budget studios like Hoods Entertainment to help back up in the visual department? GOOD, because it seems that no other studio is willing to do this batshit of a job premise, good on them. It&#039;s also SHIT.<br />
- P.S. DO NOT let the production committee have a say in the series composition (and scriptwriting for that matter), their tendency to flout ideas back and forth is just so wack that the story doesn&#039;t make any sense. SHIT story, SHIT enjoyment.<br />
<br />
In a nutshell, this show is SHIT-tier levels of BS, because it can&#039;t do anything right, much less give a resolution that also sucks, even with such a simple premise. I wish I hadn&#039;t spent my brain cells racking on this, but here I am, talking about BS shows like this that seems to be &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; that people just don&#039;t care about, but rather getting every penny of its worth regardless of its low-ball quality. Again, another classic case of quantity over quality.<br />
<br />
If at this point you still don&#039;t get what I&#039;m trying to say, I&#039;m speechless. Just save your time by not watching this show (and the OVA), I beg you, PLEASE.

    *This review contains major spoilers*<br />
<br />
Gekidol is ambitious. It wants to be different. It tries to stand out from other idol series by mixing in several dark and disparate themes. But in the end, it falls completely flat due to its outstandingly terrible execution.<br />
<br />
The first episode of Gekidol is by far its best episode. After watching a concert of a renowned idol, a girl named Seria finds herself encouraged and resolves to become an idol as well. Despite her friend warning her about the difficulties of the profession, she decides to join a small yet welcoming theatre full of nice and friendly girls, and her journey

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386687">
        towards becoming an idol begins. Sounds very generic, right? But it&#039;s far better than what comes afterward at least.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, the concept of Gekidol could have been really interesting. Unlike what the first episode may lead you to believe, it isn&#039;t just your typical idol series brimming with happy vibes, which I find rather refreshing. Granted, I&#039;m completely new to the idol subgenre, but from an outsider&#039;s perspective, not many idol series cover the rather dark and gloomy sides of being an idol. Moreover, Gekidol gives another spin on the concept by adding on a little bit Sci-Fi and mystery, or even psychological to some extent.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, that&#039;s exactly where everything starts to fall apart.<br />
<br />
As I said earlier, Gekidol is a unique idol series that covers the not-so-happy sides of being an idol and many other interesting themes—or that&#039;s what it tries to be. There are obviously several attempts at creating a profound, meaningful story with novel themes and convincing characters, but they always fail to succeed because of how poorly put together everything is. New plot points are introduced in pretty much every episode, but they are thrown in so haphazardly that they keep creating a bigger and bigger mess.<br />
<br />
In episode 1, we are given slight indications of a post-apocalyptic/semi post-apocalyptic/Sci-Fi setting, which is reinforced in the later episodes. However, it&#039;s entirely in vain, because the show never bothers to create an atmosphere that is suitable to the subjects that it tackles. In addition, the execution is awful. Some of the &quot;serious&quot; scenes become comical due to how stupid and mishandled they are. Instead of being immersed while watching them, I end up laughing hysterically.<br />
<br />
Due to the story&#039;s nature, there are several tonal changes throughout the entire show, and let me tell you, these changes are not smooth. Gekidol doesn&#039;t know what it wants to do. It wants to be an idol drama sometimes, sometimes a romance, Sci-Fi, mystery, psychological, and lots of other things that barely have any connection. Occasionally, I feel like I&#039;m watching 5 different shows at the same time—I mean that in a completely negative sense. This issue abnormally intensifies in the second half of the show; that entire half is one giant clusterfuck that steadily piles up all kinds of bullshit to create the abomination that is the ending.<br />
<br />
Apparently, the first 7 episodes weren&#039;t convoluted enough, so the anime decides to step it up to next level in the final 5 episodes. Unrequited love, human conflict, coming to terms with one&#039;s past, time travel, reshaping mankind, universe/timeline reset, rescuing the humanity and whatnot—things that don&#039;t correlate with each other whatsoever—are meshed together abysmally within only 5 episodes. As you would expect, all of this leads to a conclusion that is so catastrophic that it could be likened to a nuclear fallout of epic proportions. <br />
<br />
Regarding the characters, they are all dull and lifeless. If you replaced them with cardboard cutouts, I doubt it would make much difference. They are completely empty in terms of personality; they solely exist to drag out the story. The troupe members act like they are best friends with each other; yet there isn&#039;t any proper dynamic between them at all, and barely any time is spent in building their chemistry. Their conversations are extremely boring, monotonous, and from time to time, painfully overdramatic.<br />
<br />
The relationship of the two main leads, Seria and Airi, is concerningly unhealthy. We rarely see them interact with each other properly. It&#039;s mostly Airi being upset at Seria for making a small mistake and then yelling at her for no good reason. There are countless awkward moments between these two that serve exactly zero purpose. For example, at the end of episode 5, Airi awkwardly kisses Seria without asking her permission. Random &quot;Yuri moments&quot; like this are quite frequent in the show, which are entirely pointless and make their relationship even more awkward.<br />
<br />
Airi is probably the worst of the two. It is revealed once that she used to be a gravure model and got involved in a scandal, but the show never goes in-depth about it. Why was she working in that profession at such a young age? How did she recover from that scandal? We don&#039;t know. We are suddenly given this vital info about her past, but it is never brought up again and the show doesn&#039;t do anything else to flesh her out. I get it, she had it tough on her. But how am I supposed to sympathize with her when that&#039;s pretty much all I know about her and she behaves like a bitch without any reason?<br />
<br />
Seria isn&#039;t much better, though. Her ambition is something that we can all relate to, but that&#039;s where everything good about her ends. As a character, she is totally uninspiring, and her interactions with other characters are very stilted. Seria had a tough childhood like Airi as well, so we are expected to feel sympathy for her. But again, the show doesn&#039;t do anything else to build on her character. We are shown flashbacks of her past and learn that she apparently had familial issues, but instead of resolving anything, it just makes the plot more convoluted than it already is.<br />
<br />
The first half of the show mostly focuses on Airi and Seria, but the second half abruptly shifts the focus to Kaoru, Takezaki, and two entirely new characters that appear out of nowhere and the series doesn&#039;t give any proper introduction to them. We just know that one of them is a &quot;Gazer&quot; (time police, I guess?) like Kaoru, and the other is an &quot;Innovator&quot; who wants reform mankind (trust me, I&#039;m as confused as you). Kaoru and Takizaki&#039;s relationship is awfully presented; how they met each other, how they fell in love with each other—none of that is ever properly told. And there&#039;s this doll character too, whose purpose in the story is still a mystery to me. To be honest, I could say that about pretty much anything in the show.<br />
<br />
Other quasi-main characters don&#039;t get any focus to speak of. They are all flat and vapid to begin with, and the lack of focus on them only makes it worse. At times, there are unreasonable lapses in their actions; they don&#039;t act according to their usual personality. Occasionally, they receive your generic, obligatory character development, but it mostly comes out of nowhere. It feels like the writer had forgotten about a certain character and suddenly remembered they existed.<br />
<br />
For instance, in episode 7, we are told that Akira and Aimi were the founding members of Gekidol, and Akira has always been kinda frustrated for not being in the frontline. But prior to that episode, there weren&#039;t any indications of that whatsoever, and after a while, she is made the leader of the entire group just for the sake of plot progression. How Akira and Aimi met is another spicy story. Apparently, it&#039;s a good idea to be friends with a stranger who almost smashed your face with a bar stool. I&#039;m speechless, really.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t expect anything great from the production side either. Hoods Entertainment isn&#039;t a studio particularly known for their animation, and even then, Gekidol is far from their best work. For a show that tries to do so many &quot;innovative&quot; things when it comes to writing, you would expect the production quality to be pretty innovative as well. But rest assured, it isn&#039;t. The animation is lacklustre, and the soundtrack is full of generic idol songs barren of any creativity. The voice acting isn&#039;t bad, but lacks in excitement because of the insipid dialogue. All things considered, the production quality is mediocre at best.<br />
<br />
With the exception of Ex-Arm, Gekidol is by far the worst anime I&#039;ve watched from the Winter 2021 line-up, and probably one of the worst TV shows I&#039;ve watched to date. It had the potential to be something unique, it had the potential to be something special. But because of extreme characterization issues, absolutely horrendous presentation, and subpar production quality, it&#039;s ultimately nothing more than a disastrous failure.

    The world is facing the abyss, the stage girls are the last hope. Only they can safe the world and conjure up a smile for the citizens - welcome to the world of “Gekidol”!<br />
First of all, it has to be mentioned that “Gekidol” is THE unexpected surprise of the idol/stage anime scene. All those anime fans who (like myself as well) expected a classic idol story with a bit slice of life and maybe some Sci-Fi action after the first glance, are completely wrong. This anime &quot;GEKIDOL&quot; offers us a story which is much deeper than we can imagine and cannot be summarized in a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386090">
        whole paper…<br />
<br />
The plot takes place five years later after an entire district has disappeared suddenly. It is a mystery that no one really knows why this happened. But at those dark hours our girls from &quot;Alice in Theater&quot; want to give people new hopes with their performances. It doesn&#039;t matter what setbacks they have to suffer – from the departure of important actors to losing their performance venue - despite everything, our girls never gave up. SMT is the organization which is behind all of those acts. With the new 3D hologram technology, they want to seize control in the whole theater industry. But these modern things precisely bring many problems and have already caused tragic events. Above all, there is the director of SMT Hirokazu Takezaki, or simply called &quot;Hiro&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hiro has a dream: he wants to create a play that will amaze the whole world. He is ready to accept anything for his dream. He changes his personality and is cold-hearted towards others. Hiro met the girl of his dreams: Miki. He wants to fulfill his dream together with her. But because of the tragic event five years ago, he always assumed that they would never see each other again.<br />
The director of &quot;Alice in Theater&quot; is Kaworu, someone who is always in a good mood, as long as it is not about the theater and the financial situation. She&#039;s the one who discovered the Seria, our main character who started the whole story.<br />
Seria&#039;s dream has always been standing on a big theater stage one day. As a child she had seen such a play and has been extremely enthusiastic ever since. But Seria also has a sad past where she lost her twin sister five years ago. Even if the crucial reality catches up with her every now and then, she is fighting for her dream every day.<br />
Seria saw her twin sister in &quot;Doll&quot;. The &quot;Doll&quot; is the most mysterious character in the series. She was &quot;built&quot; to help out with plays in “Alice in Theater”. It was quickly recognized how much talent there is in this &quot;non-human figure&quot;. THE perfect actress for everything.<br />
You cannot put on a play with one or two people surely, so all of our actresses are very important. But I won’t go into more details about the others since they play a comparatively minor role in the anime-play “Gekidol”.<br />
<br />
It can directly be recognized that “Gekidol” has something dark and hidden already from the first scenes in the very first episode: a vanished city. The color is very dark and somber most of the time. Only during the performances, a lighter shade appears. The very few beautiful moments in everyday life and all hopes are associated with them. Not only the animation of the environment is successful, the characters are also well animated. The girls are portrayed in a cute way that it&#039;s just fun to watch their play.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s take a look to what I think is the best part of the anime: The music. You cannot spell &quot;Gekidol&quot; without “idol&quot;. Even if they are actually stage girls and thus differ from idols, the music is absolutely top class and certainly just as good as “normal” idols. Their songs have all the typical idol characteristic that are usually known. During the whole anime there are many insert songs as well from different characters. It&#039;s the typical idol music that makes your day better.<br />
The stage performances are also very successful, you can tell from their performances how much fun they are having and what it all means for them.<br />
<br />
What exactly did I just watch? That&#039;s probably the question everyone is asking after completing the 12 episodes of “Gekidol”. Hoods Entertainment attracted us all with idols and stage appearances, something the “kira-kira shiny” way. In the end it turned out to be a 200 IQ plot that includes all sci-fi elements. From the disappearance of a city to time travel and seeking out criminals, everything is included. Honestly, there’s too little time to resolve the plot regarding Kaworu and the Theatrical Material System (TMS) while focusing Seria’s journey of becoming an actress. These are two different pairs of shoes that have little connection with each other. I think that this anime would have much more potential if it didn&#039;t mix it all up and go through it in a rush mode. The performances and especially the music are wonderful, but unfortunately the plot in our play &quot;Gekidol&quot; failed in the end. It showed us a &quot;dream&quot; which is surely possible but only with sacrifices.<br />
For every fan who is into chaotic things, which may not be related to each other, this anime is a suitable choice. You will have a questioning face very often for sure. If you expect something more relaxing, this anime will disappoint you.<br />
In conclusion, you should take a quick look at the first few episodes to decide whether this anime suits your taste. On the other hand, a second season seems very unlikely to me, especially when you also consider the popularity and sales.<br />
<br />
Gekidol&#039;s OVA &quot;Alice in Deadly School&quot; is their most favorite place that they performed on stage.

    Gekidol seems like a fun show, an interesting show that could be something sweet. But after a first few episodes. It&#039;s not all that at all. But it&#039;s not bad, and I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll be a decent run of the mill anime as we get further along, let me explain.<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
The story follows what is set many years after a supposed disappearance of a city, with our MC in Seria being amazed by a theatrical material system, and wants to join in on the action, and we continue from there. Seeing how things work, seeing who the characters are within group, as they blend a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review375721">
        mixed style of idol singing and stage play, into an act in order to cheer up people. While having a sense of mystery that could soon come later on. It&#039;s simple, it&#039;s sweet. But holds a little bit of extra interest.<br />
<br />
Characters: 6<br />
The characters in the show seem run of the mill in terms of simple characters While some are of course stand outs within the cast. Seria is sweet, and has something hidden about her, but is a total amateur when it comes to doing this, but she tries her best, so there is some talent there. Even the supposed character that seems like she would be a bully, isn&#039;t one, and that is refreshing to see. Airi has a deep past, something I never thought would be covered in these types of shows, but it&#039;s certainly something to behold and different. Something she isn&#039;t proud of at all. While their advisor type figure seems like a right laugh too.<br />
<br />
Art and sound: 7<br />
The idol singing is pretty good, along with how the anime sounds. Can give credit there, as an anime has to have fitting sounds with it&#039;s scenes to do well. While it&#039;s art mostly looks dark like. Not super dark, but it&#039;s as if it&#039;s fitting into the themes of &#039;recovering still of a post apocalyptic  world&#039; type vibes. but still has a bit of shine and sparkle to make it look good. Along with the performances looking a bit more flashy too. It&#039;s a real good mesh of colours.<br />
<br />
Should you watch Gekidol? I&#039;d say yes! While it&#039;s a bit rough at the start, but the interest factor can help drag it along, but also it&#039;s sweetness can just be the relaxing sort that you need in a show. So go give it a go!

    Talk about a gem in the rough. When I went into this I certainly wasn&#039;t expecting the show to take me on such a wild ride, but here I am. I suppose theater type shows do inevitably muddle the line between the stage and reality, as with Revue Starlight, so I can&#039;t say I wasn&#039;t unprepared for the twists and the revelations that came, but still. <br />

You know, as an adver-anime for the real life Alice In Theater Troupe, I must say I am impressed they&#039;d bother doing a strange sort of plot that goes above and beyond the generic idol-style trappings of other shows.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386108">
        For that, I must applaud its bravery in doing so. I like giving credit for shows that bother to challenge the medium instead of conforming to usual genre cliches and tropes, and for that, Gekidol at least deserves a participation award. <br />
<br />
I did say it&#039;s rough though, and most of that comes to pacing and presentation. Fundamentally I do think Gekidol presents a genuinely fascinating story with parallels to the stage play the girls put up, the problem does come from the rough animation and pacing. The show is a pretty slow burn that doesn&#039;t reveal its cards until very late, and even then most of the show is relatively grounded up until the halfway point, where it just goes off the rails.<br />
<br />
 The main characters aren&#039;t particularly interesting, with Seria kind of losing her spotlight after the focus shifts to Takezaki and Kaworu in the latter half, and none of the other members of Alice In really do make up for the slack. I suppose the main plot could have used more episodes to flesh it out, as it stands the shift from &quot;PTSD girl does theatre to get over her loneliness&quot; to &quot;Time police shenanigans&quot;, while not unprecedented, does feel quite jarring. Perhaps I could also use another viewing to catch any foreshadowing I may have missed.<br />
<br />
As it stands, Gekidol is in a bit of a strange spot for me to recommend. On one hand I do adore the fact that it tries to do something different, but on another I feel like its shortcomings do overshadow its ambitions at times. Still, I&#039;d recommend anyone with an open mind to give it a shot. Horror-mystery shows don&#039;t come too often, and just theorizing on what could happen in the next episode each week is riveting in it of itself.<br />
<br />

    So chaotic, yet so bold. <br />
--&gt; It is NOT a story about idols, just in case someone misinterpreted &lt;--<br />
Gekidol could be more enjoyable. It has many flaws, unpolished and complicated ideas. Narratively, it makes very clumsy errors, but it has a peculiar determination I wasn’t able to ignore.<br />
I must be honest: part of me wanted to drop this anime after the third episode. It didn’t show me what I wanted to see, at that point I was very disappointed. But after seeing that spark of confidence in episode 4 and so on, my hope started to recover. The story wasn’t some generic CGDCT with magical

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386179">
        powers like Pastel Memories. Here there’s quality, just put in simple ways. But “simple” doesn’t necessarily means “bad”.<br />
The directing seems to go back to 2006, the cuts and the voice timing reminded me Simoun. In a certain way, Gekidol could be seen as a little child of that time.<br />
Characters seem shallow and void, but there are backstories for everyone. They may not be exceptional beings with lots of different qualities, that’s for sure. Actually, I don’t care so much because they do what they were created to do, without the authors’ restraint.<br />
The story, uff. Story is convoluted, to such an extent that I admire they tried to tell something like that in 12 episodes. Of course, that could be a lot better with a full 24-episodes season. Many passages are unclear and rough, too rushed at the end. The viewer can easily miss some crucial information, and I didn’t even understand 100% of what they tried to convey. Well, a reason to see it a second time.<br />
<br />
In the end, what counts more is the impact. This was a cryptic, deformed, yet pleasant impact.<br />

    Sigh. When trying to create an alternative idol series, it&#039;s important to put idols at the centre - and this series fails to do that. Repeatedly.<br />
<br />
STORY: 5<br />
<br />
This story has, essentially, multiple &quot;major&quot; plots with little to join them and even less to make you care. <br />
<br />
The main character wants to act, not sing, so there&#039;s really no incentive to want her to succeed as an idol. It feels more like a means to an end, rather than her actual goal, which made me uninterested in what should have been the main plotline.<br />
<br />
The secondary main plot is a sci-fi lovers&#039; ... nightmare? Honestly, it&#039;s so ill-thought

          <span style="display: none;" id="review392953">
        out, and feels so irrelevant and messy. It&#039;s supposed to be added motivation for the entire cast, but just feels shoved in as an attempt to appeal to a wider audience. <br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 7<br />
<br />
They&#039;ve managed to make the characters entertaining and interesting enough that I managed to complete the series. <br />
<br />
Our MC Seria is alone in Japan, and her loneliness - and denial of it - make for great motivators in her friendships, and for the viewer. Her softness is gentle, rather than annoying, and I quite liked her on the whole.<br />
<br />
Her friends are equally interesting; from those who&#039;ve failed to be idols, to those who succeed, each has an interesting perspective on the whole thing and make decisions that are as in-character as they are surprising. It&#039;s nice to see a show where  becoming an idol, or remaining one, is far from a guarantee, and brings real stakes to the Seria&#039;s journey.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 6<br />
<br />
You can&#039;t get much more &quot;generic idol pop balad&quot; than this. No, really, you can&#039;t. It&#039;s nowhere near the level of Aikatsu or Love Live, but any of their many knockoffs could happily pinch the songs of Genkidol and you&#039;d be none the wiser. That is to say, they aren&#039;t in any way bad, certainly they match the series, but they&#039;re just not worth listening to a second time. Or several times, given they&#039;re repeated across the episodes.<br />
<br />
ART: 5<br />
<br />
WTF is with the art??? It randomly inserts real people in the background photos, but the anime girls other times. The foreground and characters designs are painfully flat, and the dancing is also not great. It doesn&#039;t help that it&#039;s clearly all very inconsistent across the series.<br />
<br />
The fact all the characters look like clones is bothersome, and is real proof that anime does better with different hair colours - or at least different cuts!<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a few moments of glory, like the Holos

    Given that the source is original, the viewing experience for Gekidol could go one of two ways: really good or really bad. Unfortunately, this is one that did not hit. This anime is one that tried to fit too many elements into a tight, 12-episode series that it did not do any of them well.<br />
<br />
Story (5):<br />
Sigh. Ok there are A and B plot lines. Depending on how the anime is structured, these two plot lines could work well with each other. The A plot line follows the MC, Seria, and the theater troupe&#039;s struggle to beat out their competition due to lack of funds and

        popularity. The B plot line is a Sci-Fi one (and I can&#039;t go beyond that because it would spoil the plot). As of time of writing, Gekidol has no Sci-Fi tag, but it definitely has Sci-Fi elements.<br />
In this case, the production team tried to fit both in 12 episodes. This basically led to disaster when you try to tell a story. It feels rushed; there&#039;s no gradual plot build-up.<br />
In my opinion, the story could have been told in one of two ways. It could have done 12 episodes of just the theater troupe &quot;Alice In&quot; and its rise. Some Sci-Fi elements that doesn&#039;t impact the overall story would be fine here (little to no Sci-Fi elements; so a bit generic). Alternatively, it could do 24 episodes and drag out the current plot. With either of these two options, the story could be much more fluid. As it is right now, it&#039;s meh.<br />
<br />
Character (5):<br />
To continue with my story argument, if the production team approached the story progression differently, characters could have more depth into them. I would&#039;ve loved to see all the characters get some sort of backstory. As it is, only the &quot;main&quot; character, Seria, gets the most backstory. It&#039;s a missed opportunity, I think.<br />
The other characters aren&#039;t bland or anything, it&#039;s just there&#039;s not much backstory and progression. I don&#039;t see them grow as much.<br />
<br />
Sound (7):<br />
The music part of this anime seems like an afterthought. Don&#039;t get me wrong, the soundtrack is great. I don&#039;t really know how to explain it, but it&#039;s not that the music quality is bad. The OST is used in appropriate environments, but it&#039;s more like the OP&amp;ED, as well as any inserts, are just there because the plot needs them to. It&#039;s like the production team went &quot;We need an opening song. Let&#039;s just write a random one, get the VAs to sing it, and put them in.&quot; It doesn&#039;t feel natural.<br />
<br />
Art (6): It&#039;s not horrible nor outstanding.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (6) &amp; Overall (6):<br />
I get what the production team is trying to tell us. However, it required me to go back and re-watch certain parts to really understand what a scene is trying to convey or what plot line is being delivered. It&#039;s nice to watch, but very confusing at times and brings down the enjoyment level for me.<br />
Overall, Gekidol had so much wasted potential that could&#039;ve used some better direction.
