    I used to be an agnostic, but this anime has turned me into an atheist. Seriously, look at this abomination and tell me there’s a god. Where did we go wrong? I had just started forgiving JC Staff for OPM S2, but now my anger and disappointment, mainly disappointment, have been rekindled. <br />
<br />
Okaasan online which is better known as “Tsuujou Kougeki ga Zentai Kougeki de Nikai Kougeki no Okaasan wa Suki Desuka” which roughly translates to “This is a light novel adaptation”, is an anime about a guy being transported to another world. You might be thinking, “OK, it’s another one of those”, but don’t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318417">
        be hasty because there’s a twist – it’s about a boy who gets transported to another world along with his mom. What a twist, right? This new world is made for a mother and her child to embark on an adventure and become closer to each other in the process. Ergo, the protagonist and his mom are transported to another world in order for them to reconcile and appreciate each other’s presence more.<br />
<br />
It’s an OK premise, but the execution is absolutely horrendous. Filled with clichés, insipid comedy and your usual harem setup, whatever enjoyment could’ve been found is lost. The plot heavily relies on oversaturated tropes and fanservice. The characters have no personality of their own and their characterisation relies on the setting instead of being the other way around. I will not be getting into the fanservice aspect of this show in this review. All you need to know about it is that it is probably a degenerate weeb’s Milf fantasy.<br />
<br />
The main cast of characters consists of your quintessential unsophisticated harem protagonist and his mom, a tsundere, a loli and another weird character all of whom don’t contribute anything to make the setting interesting. There’s one more annoying recurring characters called Shirase who makes garbage puns for the sake of dry and bland comedy. <br />
<br />
The characters really get as banal as they can. The tsundere girl, Wise, is basically a tsundere girl, nothing more, nothing less. The pink haired loli, Porter, basically annoys you with her Helium infested voice. Medhi is a pathetic excuse for a character. It feels like no character has a free will of their own and are just following in the footsteps of their ancient counterparts that have been seen about a billion times in other anime.<br />
<br />
Masato is practically a useless character as he’s only used for slapstick comedy and for worthless virgins to project themselves upon; and he’s the protagonist. Mamako, Masato’s mom is just an irksome heap of tits, ass and seizure inducing voice. Speaking of seizure inducing voice, the voice actors try their best to produce the most painful voice that they can. Every character sounds like someone scratched a blackboard with their fingernails. The voice acting is pure cringe. Whenever I don’t like a character in a movie or anime I express my anger on the character as I know that the actors and voice actors are just playing the roles they’re given, but, Mamako’s cringy af voice makes me want to punch the voice actress in the face. But, then again I should perhaps direct my anger towards the writer.<br />
<br />
The comedy is deplorable. The author probably watched a bunch of harem and isekai anime and tried to parody them but utterly failed. First of all, let’s talk about the most annoying character in the anime – Shirase, whose name means “to inform” in Japanese. After hearing the puns she makes on her name, it required an enormous amount of effort from my side to not punch my laptop to death. After hearing those puns, I regret learning Japanese because I understood the puns in more detail than I would have had I not learnt Japanese. Rest of the comedy is situational which requires a good line delivery, but there was nothing of that sort. Felt like the voice actors just gave up and uttered the lines just for the sake of uttering them. <br />
<br />
The lines are insipidly delivered with no regards to the characters’ emotional state. Makamo always sounds cringy, Masato always sounds like a basic bitch, Wise is always stuck up, Medhi has as much personality as a white board and I don’t really know how Porter sounds because I had to lower the volume whenever she spoke as I don’t have the mental or physical strength to endure her Helium infected loli voice.<br />
<br />
The music is bland and I was really pissed when they didn’t play Sweet Home Alabama even once. The animation is basic. <br />
<br />
I don’t even know what I expected from this show and I’m shocked and disappointed in myself, mostly disappointed, for having finished this show.<br />

    Okaa-san Online attempts to be somewhat different to its other isekai counterparts by giving the protagonist a choice whether to go into a game world in order to test it or not. And having the protagonist’s mother tag along with him. I’ll let you in on a little secret: This anime was kinda interesting. For the first 5 minutes of the first episode. <br />
<br />
Afterwards, it was the same old isekai, only with a MILF involved. This series tries to be funny by using the same old jokes and fails in the most spectacular fashion. I’ll give it credit for accepting what it is though: MMMMORPG

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318415">
        – Mom’s Massively Maternal Multiplayer Making-up-with- Offspring Role-Playing Game. Replace “Making-up” with “Making-out” and the title suits this shitshow to a T. <br />
<br />
A badass mother who takes care of all the enemies that dare cross paths with her son, characters talking about stats, the boring “I can get this attack when I level up” and hot girls joining the MC’s party are some of the things that go on in this anime. If done well, these things can make for a funny experience but decent direction and execution isn’t what Okaa-san Online is about, you know?<br />
<br />
This is a show about an overprotective mother wanting to get closer to her son, and it makes this clear in no uncertain terms from the beginning itself. Add in lots of panty shots, repeatedly failed comedy attempts, some duplicates of other isekai girls and a MILF, and you’ve got whatever this tragedy of a show wanted to be.<br />
<br />
Some of the situations that the characters end up in are totally disgusting and not the least bit funny. If someone wants to watch these things, they’d be better off watching porn instead. Masato, the lead character of the series, ends up fondling his mother’s breasts more times than he probably did when she breast-fed him as a baby. Heck, I bet his father didn’t fondle them as much as he’d done in these 12 episodes. <br />
<br />
We’re supposed to believe that Mamako, who looks not much older than his son, is the mother. The time that this show is not showing off the curvy body of hers with her son finding ways to end up in situations that would make a happily married couple embarrassed, it goes off on uninteresting adventures and missions that we’ve seen a thousand times over. What makes this even worse are the things that I mentioned in the last paragraph. <br />
<br />
We’ve got a few other characters too, if you can even call them characters that is. They’re simply objects of fan-service in between the constantly censored MILF porn. First up is Porta, whose only role is to carry shit around. Then, we’ve got Wise the sage, a short-tempered girl who split up with her mother because of an argument. I’ll give this show some credit for trying to develop a real chemistry between Masato and Wise. Not the anime’s fault that the writing reeks of incompetence, right? <br />
<br />
Oh, how JC staff has fallen. From butchering the likes of One Punch Man Season 2 to the sequels to the fantastic Shokugeki no Soma, JC staff have produced some absolute shitshows in comparison to their previous works in the last couple or so years. I think they’re just taking far too many projects and pumping out some absolute crap as a product of that. It’s the same story with the production quality with Okaa-san Online. Neither the animation nor the sound departments are anything but bang average. Shoddily animated sequences and colored manga panels panning in, out, left and right sums up the visual part of this show. The only somewhat well animated scenes are, well, the ones which should belong to a hentai anime. Enough said about the production.<br />
<br />
As for the final verdict, do I recommend this anime? If you want to watch a weak MC and his mother end up in socially questionable situations while being surrounded by dull and boring characters who don’t have any entertainment value to them at all, and comedic scenes which are not funny more often than not, who am I to stop you? But I’d suggest you save your time and breath and look around for something better to watch. It’ll hardly take a minute to find something better than this.

    Now I know people are going to disagree with me on some regards but this is how I feel about this series and personally I love it and look forward to each episode also this is my first review for an anime so don’t be harsh <br />
<br />
Story: (7) It’s a typical Isekai story but the main difference is the main character goes to a video game world as apart of a government project and his mom is going with him, I don’t think a story has to be creative in order to be good so I don’t really mind that it’s an Isekai <br />
<br />
Art (7)

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314404">
        Arts pretty standard as in animation wise, from what I see so far the characters and the world itself look good and CGI is used for monsters but it looks pretty good so far and looks like it fits into the world. The only thing I say is different art wise is the characters designs and how they look specifically the eyes and honestly I love how the eyes are drawn and creates a bit of uniqueness design wise<br />
<br />
Sound (7) Soundtrack is standard though I do think the OP is very catchy visually and the song itself not much to say here <br />
<br />
Characters (8) I admit that I read this series before this aired at least a couple of the light novel volumes so I knew that the slime scene was going to happen and honestly I don’t like it and that is the only thing I dislike about this series (the very weird Ecchi scenes) but what sticks out to me is the characters and not as in they are beautifully written and are the best characters of all time, they aren’t but what I like about them is how real the are in the sense that their stories felt real to me and they show more then just one emotion outside of the characters stereotypes.<br />
Take Wise (the Tsundere for example) when I first saw her I thought I had her figured out and who she was some semi bitchy tsundere who is very rude to our MC Masato despite the fact that she likes him but I was wrong...sorta she is sorta rude and isn’t really a wonderful person but not only does she know that they way she treats him is a problem but actually tries her best to apologize and try to get along with everyone in the party again and honestly I felt sad when she told her story about her and her mother and how the way she is treated is just awful <br />
I know I spent to much time talking about Wise so I’ll just make the rest of the characters short as I can <br />
<br />
Masato (our main lead) Though he is a bit of an ass to Mamako he shows that he truly loves her and it’s not that he doesn’t love her it’s the fact that he doesn’t want to be treated like a little kid, he’s also really funny at times and his cringe faces always put a smile to my face <br />
<br />
Mamako She’s pretty standard as the doting mother type but honestly the way she is with her son is kinda adorable and she’s just trying her best to be a good mom but she does need a bit of a backbone when it comes to Masato, even though he immediately apologizes to Mamako after he is rude to her she just needs to be a little more strict with him <br />
<br />
Porter Their isn’t much to say about her yet, she’s adorable she’s actually a asset to the team and she isn’t lewded at all so that’s a plus <br />
<br />
Shirase Funniest character in this series I love her and her role to the story as the Shirase (informer) she tells you things and then she dies love her <br />
<br />
Medhi: Personally my least favorite of the bunch but not saying it in a bad way, sometimes she can be really funny and roast the shit out of the side characters and sometimes she’s just a bitch<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (9) Though their is some cliches with this story (it’s a freaking Isekai it’s has to have some cliches) I say that it utilizes what it has well and makes a really fun story <br />
<br />
Overall 7.5 It has some unenjoyable things in this series like the faint incest undertones but the mother and son only view each other as mother and son so I can deal with some ecchi scenes as long as they don’t end up together (it doesn’t seem like it in the light novel and manga) but overall it’s a sweet and hilarious mother and son Isekai story that I know isn’t enjoyable to all but you can’t satisfy everyone especially with Isekai so I know that some people will say it’s the worst story ever but they are just exaggerating

    This sorry excuse for an Isekai is so shockingly bad that i was actually speechless watching the first episodes. For the most part it feels like a parody of itself, but sadly without any sign of understanding the trophes and elements it is using.<br />
<br />
Story, setting, characters and even jokes seem to be heavily ,,inspired&quot; by popular isekai animes of the last years, but without the charm or imagination to do anything worthwile with it. It feels like a clusterfuck of clichés to put it bluntly.<br />
<br />
We got discout versions of Kazuma and Aqua from Konosuba, an overpowered main character from any run of the mill isekai,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314408">
        a Sword Art Online video game world(but without the danger of dying), incest bait like we see in masterpieces like Conception, a surprisingly strong slime like in Tensei Shitara... well you get the point.<br />
<br />
And i normaly wouldn´t bring that up in a review like this, but the soundtrack and the sound design are just so bad. It´s like a toddler heard a Undertale song once and tried to copy that as quick as possible.<br />
<br />
I could go on and on like this, talking about how the character and story don´t make sense at all, or how purely written the dialog is, but i don´t want to waste any more time even thinking about this series.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just skip this one.

    Well, I’ll be damned. The isekai genre finally did it! They made a show about MILF in a fantasy adventure in 2019! With such a long ridiculous title, you should take a breath and not take this anime seriously. Just when you thought the world would be ok, this absurd thing called Okaasan Online became a reality.<br />
<br />
It’s easy to actually enjoy this anime when you turn your brains off or at least watch it without an agenda. After seeing the trailers and the promotional material, it’s obvious the anime is more of a parody of itself. I’m not going to lie though, watching Ookasan Online

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318416">
        is guilty pleasure like eating junk food when you’re on a diet. The show is saturated with absurd ideas with the central focus about an overly loving mom. Main protagonist Masato Oosuki is bombarded with affections by her mother, Mamako. The two gets transported into a fantasy world as their adventures begin.<br />
<br />
You’re probably going to question if this anime has incest elements. It’s controversial enough that Mamako is portrayed as MILF with Masato as her son. Their relationship challenges the borderlines of a son-mother connection. At its very baseline, it’s shown that Mamako genuinely loves Masato like a mother would. The real question is how much she shows that love. The first few episodes dedicates to bringing out both characters’ personalities as much as possible. Mamako is portrayed as a kind woman who sometimes can behave like a child yet also has a mature side of herself. As a protective parent, she gets angered easily when her son is threatened and is fiercely devoted to her motherly duties. In essence, you can picture Mamako as the ideal standard of a mother. Masato is portrayed more of as a typical teenager and as you can imagine, he gets embarrassed by her mother’s over the top antics. The first few episodes shows their character chemistry that sometimes will jump way over itself with its humor. For instance, it seems Mamako can’t seem to stand straight for 5 minutes if she isn’t with her son. Poor Masato. He can’t really ever be free even in a world that’s not real.<br />
<br />
But as you can imagine, Okaasan Online overall has more of a satirical parody tone. It takes the isekai genre and transforms it into a story with some incest context and less so about a hero saving the world from evil. The story structure seems to focus on adventures at times but overall revolves around Mamako and Masato’s relationship. The amount of incest subtext is evident in some later episodes especially with bath scenes and other innendos. Plus, you can’t deny the look on Masato’s face when he shows attraction towards Mamako. Fortunately, the anime doesn’t pursue any sort of serious drama between the pair and instead plays it out like a parody. Yet, you have to wonder if there’s any actual romance at all in this anime. The answer is sort of but not quite. Sure, we have Masato falling heels for the feminine Medhi but again, their relationship plays out more like a lighthearted comedy. Even after Medhi shows her “darker side”, it’s hard to take her character seriously at all. Like I said before, you should watch this anime with your brains turned off and let the anime speaks for itself. It’s not trying to hide anything with the amount of running gag or the obvious suggestive tones.<br />
<br />
Outside of the main leads, it’s hard to find appeal about the other supporting cast. Characters such as Shirase, Porta, or Wise just doesn’t carry the same amount of presence as Mamako. If you’ve ever played an MMORPG before, it’s like they are the supporting party while Mamako and Masato are the co-leaders. Occasionally, their dialogues can bring out a few laughs but it’s still overshadowed by the overpowered Mamako. Speaking of dialogues, it’s also hard to deny the show is consciously self-aware. Phrases such as “we are family, so it’s normal” is one of the most overused ways to showcase the son-mother relationship. There’s also dialogues about housewife jokes and character expressions showing how a typical mom would behave. If you’re not a fan of this style of humor, you’re not going to find much joy in Okaasan Online.<br />
<br />
I’m starting to wonder if J.C. Staff is on some sort of mission to prove how productive they are in the anime industry this year. At the time of this writing, they had four ongoing projects including this show all airing the same season. Okaasan Online didn’t fall victim to production issues but it still has an average animation quality. Let’s face it, the characters has some of the most generic looks known to humankind. The one that stand above the rest is Mamako who is decorated with MILF qualities. Because she is an older woman compared to most of the cast, it’s no surprise she has a more mature body. In some episodes, the anime even decides to put her into suggestive outfits to bring the most of her appeal. In other cases, the anime relies on fan service with bath scenes. Unfortunately, the TV version contains censored lights so help us God, let the BD/DVD versions remove that nonsense. Character expressions is mostly showcased with humor with the amount of pout scenes and cartoony reactions. Does it make you laugh? That’s for you to decide but the show clearly wants you to watch this with your brains turned off.<br />
<br />
Watching Okaasan Online wasn’t entirely a dreadful experience. Trust me, there’s garbage like Isekai Cheat Magician out there which is about as tasteless as isekai can be. On the other hand, this is one of those series that’s going to appeal a certain audience. It’s actually one of the first momcom (as Yen Press describes it) anime adaptations I remember in recent years so that&#039;s something new, I guess?

    Millions of years of evolution have lead us to this point. We as a species have learnt to read, write, love, hate, laugh and cry for this very moment. Years upon years of boring, trite Isekai shows have not been for naught. This is the single most monolithic event of our minuscule existence on this orbiting rock.<br />
<br />
People often like to point fingers at Sword Art Online as the sole reason that the Isekai genre has become an absolute cesspool. While SAO has contributed greatly, the major reason it&#039;s become as bad as it has is largely in result of the massive amount of money and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318452">
        attention it was able to pull. Money is more often than not the death of creativity, look at the Star Wars franchise. <br />
<br />
Tsuujou Kougeki ga Zentai Kougeki de Ni-kai Kougeki no Okaasan wa Suki Desu ka? Is an absolute mouthful to read but more than that, it&#039;s stupid, and it&#039;s acutely aware that it is. Which is more than I can say about the other Isekai shows that ran this season. There&#039;s also an actual goal, although vague it&#039;s a goal nonetheless, bond with your mother in a video game. <br />
<br />
I feel I must discuss the points that did enjoy. The animation and art actually impressed me, the style lends itself well to the video game theme.. alright I could only manage one positive.<br />
<br />
Look, i&#039;m aware that this show might not be for me and hell, i&#039;m not even the target demographic. Different strokes for different folks. And a stroke is exactly what this show feels like to sit through. <br />
<br />
Let there be no illusions, this show is a fetishist&#039;s wet dream masquerading as an anime. Going into the show I was fully expecting it to be bad, hilariously bad. I was not fully prepared for how awful this show turned out to be. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s say that everything after the first episode was incognito mode. <br />
<br />
Most Isekai shows rely on the viewer to self insert. Self inserting into a show where the premise is to adventure with your mother is extremely strange. The protagonist is always deflated by the immense amount of fan service his mil-.. mother is put through and that same unenthusiam bleeds into the viewer. It&#039;s disturbing at best. Even more disturbing than that is the clear attempt to garner the interest of those who find incest enticing by having beams from the sun censor what little enjoyment they can attain from this show. It&#039;s clear that the creators just want you to buy the bluray boxed sets with the censorship removed so they can feast their eyes upon the uninteresting nudity. <br />
<br />
It always loops back to money.  <br />
<br />
The sexualization of the mother is a bit strange but moving on the groping and suggestive dialogue got really increasingly more and more uncomfortable. <br />
<br />
Judging just off the artwork and genres on MAL, I was just expecting a lighthearted romp into a mediocre parody show. A wink and a nudge here and there, nothing to get too worked up over. Like most things, I was wrong. The shameless and almost comedic lengths the show would take just to have an uninspired attempt at titillation was enough to give me a headache. It set off red flags immediately, but like an abusive partner I kept coming back. <br />
<br />
Speaking of abuse, oh boy! In addition to the off-putting incest the show displays, it also includes verbal, sexual and emotional abuse! Exactly what i&#039;d want to see in my show about being sucked into a video game world. Medhi who is a character introduced in the later half of the show is constantly berated and mocked by her mother. At a point she&#039;s even stripped naked and choked against a tree. It&#039;s a superficial attempt to stir drama and it was completely unnecessary, leaving a rancid taste in the mouth of the viewer. <br />
<br />
I say superficial because the show does nothing to justify these story elements or provide a solution in a meaningful or satisfying way. Problems are solved by the typical &quot;I was in a dark place&quot; rhetoric a Youtuber would use in an apology video. It&#039;s sickening.<br />
<br />
Speaking from my own experience the show made me question the very meaning of life. Where am I? Who am I? Why am I watching this tripe? Why do I even exist at all. <br />
<br />
I had an existential crisis over why I even decided to torture myself with 12 episodes of this filth. It was so I could warn readers like yourself to stay very far away. I&#039;ve successfully found my life&#039;s purpose.  <br />
<br />
To close, i&#039;d like to end with a philosophical quote: &quot;Ma-kun, your mommy is soaking wet!&quot; - Mamako Oosuki

    [Spoiler Warning]<br />
<br />
This is an anime about a mother and a son who venture into an isekai world together in one of the most uninspired and bad isekai-shows to date. There are zero intriguing characters and worldbuilding is inexistent. The show looks like trash and i don’t remember any of the music.<br />
<br />
Shitty mom-jokes:<br />
Yup, one of the main gags in this anime is how the mother wants to play around with her son in this fantasy world but the son doesn’t want to. Of course he can’t resist physically since she is stronger than him, neither can he resist emotionally as she throws a hissy fit and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314413">
        starts crying whenever he complains about the fact that she essentially kidnapped him. It turns out in episode two that the entire isekai world is rigged in the mothers favor, she has complete dominion over her son and the company that created the fantasy game is in on it. I guess this is supposed to be super funny, but it isn&#039;t. “Haha, look it the son trying too venture off on his own just for the mom to use her magical powers to track him down.” or “Haha, look at the mom treating anyone spending more time with her son then she does as an enemy” is not funny. The joke doesn’t land. I’m not saying there is no way to make obsessive parents entertaining. There might be, this just isn’t it. I&#039;ve never found enjoyment in those types of jokes, making bad parenting funny is hard and this low-level anime shouldn&#039;t have tried to pull it off. <br />
<br />
Mom-jokes aside:<br />
This anime is so bad, the jokes are so sloppy and usually just some primitive form of slapstick. Funny characters or interesting worldbuilding is of course also inexistent. So even if i wanted to ignore the shitty mom-related jokes there are no other redeeming qualities either. It must be so easy to make bad animes when you can just hide behind the excuse that your anime is a parody or something. <br />

    Ugh....<br />
<br />
This anime has identity problem. Props to them for trying something new, but the series in the episodes I saw can&#039;t decide if it wants to be a parody, a comedy, a fan-service series, or if it is going to keep promoting &quot;parent-child bonding&quot;.<br />
<br />
In the end by 4th episode they push the &quot;parent-child&quot; thing too hard and it becomes cringe-inducing. <br />
<br />
Story: 4/10<br />
<br />
As I said, identity problem. It doesn&#039;t know what it is trying to do so we go through fanservice phase, parody phase, and end up with &quot;parent-child relation&quot; phase. The relation thing sounds very preachy and shatters suspension of disbelief. Not that there was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314471">
        a lot of suspension of disbelief to begin with.<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10:<br />
Art is surprisinglyg good. It is kinda stereotypical, but detailed and well drawn, however by episode 4 I noticed attack animation reuse.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10:<br />
Okay, I suppose? They&#039;re tryin to joke with music on occasion, but it doesn&#039;t work.<br />
<br />
Characters: 4/10:<br />
Heavily cliched, with male lead being annoying to the point where you want to slap them. Definitely do not resemble real people in the slihtest.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 4/10:<br />
I didn&#039;t like it.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4/10:<br />
Not recommended. Visuals are nice, but this anime was quite unenjoyable for me, and characters weren&#039;t believable.<br />
<br />
So I dropped it after 4th episode.

    I know this is in the minority here, but I have thoroughly enjoyed this series. That said, it is not for everyone.<br />
<br />
 I just got to Japan a few weeks ago, and this is super popular here, so I decided to try it out. Started watching and 10 minutes in, I knew I was hooked. <br />
<br />
The story is quite literally as LN and as Isekai as you can get. Boy offered to go inside of a game as part of a test, gathers a party and goes on quests. What separates this from other Isekai is that he&#039;s got his mother tagging along with him

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314685">
        on his quests. On top of that, his mother is OP AF and is basically the Kirito of this universe. The series doesn&#039;t take itself too serious and is quite aware of the fact that it is basically parodying common isekai tropes. A lot of people probably get put off by his mother&#039;s child like behaviour and tendencies, but honestly I think it&#039;s adorable and is a big reason why I continue to watch, this is probably why it&#039;s so big in Japan as anyone who knows Japanese culture knows that we like doting and protective mothers here.<br />
<br />
Art: Art is great and consistent, really love the art style and character designs.<br />
<br />
Animation: There&#039;s not too many heavy fight scenes yet, so we really have not had to test the animation too much, but so far it looks nice.<br />
<br />
Sound: sound design is pretty good, again, nothing yet that really required it to be tested<br />
<br />
Characters: Porter reminds me a lot of Sahara from Log Horizon and I was 99 percent sure they had the same VA until I checked and was proven wrong. She&#039;s a decent comic relief and little sister/daughter for the team<br />
<br />
Masato is the main character(in theory) and really is your typical isekai protag, otaku, lacking social skills, black hair, good at video games and bad at life. Nothing special, other than his relationship with his mother. Kinda reminds me of a mix between Kazuma and Subaru in terms of skillset and his uselessness<br />
<br />
Wise: Adorable sage who I&#039;m currently shipping with Masato. Has a lot of potential for character development due to her insecurities so I&#039;ll be looking forward to seeing how that goes. Has a decent set of magical abilties and is the second most useful person of the squad so far.<br />
<br />
Sharase: Adorable comic relief character who basically pops up to guide the team along to new quests and provide them with important info. She kicks things off by inviting Masato to the game world<br />
<br />
Okasan: Absolute best waifu material. To some she&#039;s probably really annoying, childish and a turn off. Complete opposite for me, big turn on for the series and I love the premise that she&#039;s the OP character, deserves endless headpats.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Solid 10 for me. I&#039;m a simple guy, if I enjoy something, it&#039;s an 8, I rarely watch anime I don&#039;t like, and have never really given anything below a 7, so for a series I really enjoy, which this is, easy 10. I like the ecchi moments, occasional incest references, fan service shots with Wise, etc.<br />
<br />
Overall:10 for me. If you don&#039;t like fan service, silly moments, or general Japanese entertainment for actual Japanese people, you might not like this one. It&#039;s not a super serious and deep series. It&#039;s light hearted, fun, funny and a good ride, I can&#039;t recommend it enough.

    Once again, we have a bunch of weebs taking themselves too seriously and hating on an anime that&#039;s obviously a comedy and guilty-pleasure series. This anime doesn&#039;t take itself too seriously, it IS a parody with a bunch of oedipus complex dumped in. Mamako, the mom, is sooo lovable, her son, relatable, and the music is actually pretty good, and sometimes 8bit. There&#039;s plenty of fan service, and if you love isekais, you will LOVE the jokes in this anime, laugh out loud love them. If you come into this anime thinking it&#039;s going to be a SERIOUS anime about a mother and son transported

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314963">
        into a MMO (why would you think that?) Then of course you&#039;re going to be disappointed. <br />
<br />
If Mamako was my mother that wasn&#039;t related by blood, I&#039;d enter a MMMMMORPG with her any day. The dynamic between parents is metaphorical for real life. Kids often see their parents as super heroes, and even as teenagers, as people with some kind of unknown power over life and their own emotions. Mamako is definitely an idealized mother, and her son grows to learn how to be more appreciative of her. It&#039;s honestly a bit heart-warming, and if you know anything about parenting or if you remeber clearly how you were raised, it might cause a tad bit of introspection.<br />
<br />
But don&#039;t get too deep watching this anime, because uh.... This is a soft hint at incest and isekai/geek comedy. It&#039;s not deep, just sometimes a commentary on the relationships between kids and their role models/guardians. Keep in mind that raising kids in Japan is a lot different than western cultures. They definitely are very guiding-oriented, and I&#039;d argue even though that might seem oppressive to freedom-loving American teens, it would do every kid a lot better if their parent was more invested in them.  Also, this is an anime so every real-life norm is going to be exaggerated, in no way is this anime supporting anything too overbearing.

    I&#039;m not quite sure why everyone is so quick to jump on a hate bandwagon if an anime dares to just try to focus on comedy instead of a super serious isekai. Everything from the title, the concept, to even the fact that there&#039;s a big ol&#039; &quot;Comedy&quot; and &quot;Ecchi&quot; tag attached to this this anime on both MAL and Crunchyroll should have told you that if you do not like fanservice filled comedy animes, this isn&#039;t your kind of thing. Now that I&#039;ve bitched about everyone else, it&#039;s time for what I think of it.<br />
<br />
(POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD)<br />
<br />
Story<br />
Is this story great? Not exactly. With it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317331">
        being so basic there&#039;s not much to criticize about it apart from it being basic. Usually, I&#039;d smite an anime that has an attitude that deserves a really well written story but in this case it never claims to have a great story. Like I mentioned earlier, it&#039;s a really lighthearted comedy anime that just aims to make you laugh above all else and I can&#039;t fault it for that as the concept fits that aim perfectly.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
It&#039;s good, but nothing special. There were a few times where the animation looked a bit awkward but overall I don&#039;t really have any complaints about it. One part of the animation I really liked were the 8-bit like &quot;loading&quot; transitions which I thought were a good touch.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
Much like the art, it&#039;s nothing special. But it does fit the whole game theme really well and even the 8-bit SFX were done rather well.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
As of episode 6, we now have our full cast of characters that actually stick around:<br />
<br />
Mamako<br />
She&#039;s the hub of all the fanservice this anime provides (up until Medhi is introduced, anyway). Often seen as a MILF, she is a surprisingly innocent character that through her motherly antics often sees Masato having the isekai experience he expected being ruined. The different ways she completely smashes Masato&#039;s expectations provides a great source of comedy within this show. 9/10<br />
<br />
Masato<br />
Our MC of this anime that many have found annoying, but isn&#039;t the whole point of him being in this game world the fact that he&#039;s an arrogant little twat that constantly disregards his mother? His overoptimism plays greatly into his dichotomy with Mamako with his high expectations setting the stage for Mamako to shoot him down within seconds. I can&#039;t really say he&#039;s the best character, but he&#039;s the best fit for this story. 6/10<br />
<br />
Porta<br />
An innocent child who often provides obvious information to the viewers and other party members, much to their frustration. I don&#039;t have much to say about Porta, she&#039;s just kind of irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. 5/10<br />
<br />
Wise<br />
Ah, a classic arrogant tsundere. Her overconfidence in her magic provides excellent comedy in the fact that about 5 seconds later her magic gets sealed rendering her useless until she downs about 40 gallons of MP potions or gets someone to unseal her magic. She&#039;s constantly making snide remarks at Masato and often antagonizes him throughout the series, making fun of him for his overoptimism. When Medhi joins the party, she and Medhi enter a kind of a relationship that just has them constantly at each others necks with snide comments and trying to 1-up each other, offering a lot of chances for comedy. 8/10<br />
<br />
Medhi<br />
The heroine that had an incredibly dark side to her. She&#039;s cute, has a gentle attitude and is also a great source of fanservice for this anime. Her goal is to be loved as a party healer, and when she learns that Mamako is probably going to impede her ability to take that role, she does everything she can to try to make herself at the very least more useful than Wise. Her dark side is that she takes great joy in undermining other people&#039;s confidence by making nasty remarks to them. She often likes to toy with Masato, offering a great source of comedy. She&#039;s a dark girl, but she&#039;s my favorite nonetheless. 10/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
Despite its flaws, I am enjoying the hell out of this anime. I don&#039;t exactly know what it is that makes me enjoy it so much, but whatever it is, I hope there&#039;ll be a second season of it. 10/10 for enjoyment.

    Finally an anime that adheres to my taste -Kakyoin 20XX<br />
*spoilers warning for those who are weak.<br />
Okaasan online (OO) is a rather odd but inevitable anime to come out recently. Riding the wacky train of high-concept isekai premises, with this one being “what if the main character went to another world, but with his mom”. Okasan is able to land firmly in between the too ridiculous to take seriously, but not too ridiculous that you can’t make a small adaptation out of it. While it’s obvious that this entire work was made just for cheap thrills so that anybody can watch it ironically, and for others

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318421">
        to ogle at waifu bait until the doujinshis come along. The show, intentionally or not, ends up showcasing some interesting themes that ended up with me wanting to write this review about it.<br />
<br />
In the beginning OO is presented  as a show that really doesn’t care about it’s own story. It takes a lot of tropes from recent isekai anime, and includes a mom with them. It’s mainly used for the sake of humor, but that’s really the beginning and end of the joke. Haha, isn’t it funny that the mom is journeying with the main protagonist. Haha isn’t it funny that the mom is more overpowered than the child, ha ha ha. <br />
<br />
The show also certainly doesn’t care about having a narrative drive, especially in the beginning of the story. It doesn’t care about reason or purpose, only results which are getting to why this show exists in the first place, anything else doesn’t matter. Why is the government able to send people into a video game? Doesn’t matter. Why is a video game used as a parent child bonding program? Doesn’t matter. What’s the end game in order to complete the program? Obviously for parent and child to be closer. How is this gauged? DOES NOT MATTER.<br />
<br />
The first few episodes of OO are rather aimless. Treading the same waters of other shows of its nature by doing similar riff,gags, and references to JRPGs and videogames in general. The show also has a handful of mom puns, or at least it has many things in this world that has some variation of the word mom jammed into it. The mother’s name is “mama”ka, the protagonist&#039;s name is masato which is shortened to Ma-kun, the currency of the world is called mam which sounds close to mom, and pretty much every city and town has the word placed into it, etc etc. They do lessen as the show continues on or at least aren’t that annoying. <br />
<br />
After those few episodes the show tries to build some sort of narrative, and it does so by using its themes as a sort of glue so it can have some cohesion. Since during their early aimless travels, the protagonist and his mother picked up other young players to join their adventure. Since the game is mainly about parent and child bonding it would seem odd that the other players they recruited aren’t without their parents which becomes the whole point. With Wise, one of the players they picked up along the way, becoming the catalyst of what this show is all about. The first main “story line” deals with the party dealing with wise&#039;s mother who is causing trouble in the game. It’s during this story line that it’s revealed that wise’s mother had been very neglectful of her, and despite the game being an attempt to reconcile, the mom ends up abandoning her.<br />
<br />
It becomes obvious that the shows main themes are about parenthood, motherhood, and interpersonal relationships. The entire parent-child bonding program becomes more than just a ploy to show case hot milfs, but to also showcase themes that while may be obvious, they at least make the show more interesting  from other derivative isekais. With the next storyline being the opposite of the first, this time having an overbearing parent helicopter over her child in some vicarious fashion. And the final storyline not really having an antagonistic parent, but more so rebellious children who are a mirror to the main protagonist.<br />
<br />
Of course interesting themes can only go so far because the writing still sucks. The characters are pretty much dragged from place to place by one of the admins, Shirase, in order to solve these problems and for the storylines to happen. Two of the main storylines resolving with a Mom v. Mom battle via might makes right, with might being the plot bending over backwards for Mamako to always be the winner. Not to mention how Mamako is pretty much the second coming of jesus christ who can do no wrong and becomes way to preachy about being a mom. The only criticism towards her comes from her own son, and even then it really doesn’t matter anyway. <br />
<br />
Then there’s Wise and Medhi the two supporting characters whose storylines with their mothers we go through, as they both have interesting characterization by their personalities being a result of how their mothers treated them. However those personalities end up being the only thing about them and also just become jokes. Which is very much the case of Medhi who has a kind personality the show in front of others, and also a malicious personality that’s filled with contempt towards others, especially towards her mother. It portrays how screwed up she has become from how her mother had treated her, but in the end it’s later portrayed like some dumb sadistic quirk that makes her say one-liners every once in a while. Not to mention that their mothers, who get shafted after their story lines are over, were being manipulated the whole time they were in the game. They were still presented as no-good parents before the game, but it was that manipulation that made them 10x worse.  So it’s hard to tell whether a character like Medhi got her personality before or during the start of the game.<br />
<br />
Sure the show is a comedy and all of this shouldn’t be taken too seriously, but that serious stuff is the only thing the show has going for it since the comedy is mostly stale. So it is a shame that such interesting themes are stuck in such a “plot”, with such ideas being ripe for examination and exploration, and the current setting being a perfect place to facilitate it. There are many possible types of combinations between the parent and child relationship such as an adoptive child, siblings of any degree, or even a NEET child just to name a few. Even the inclusion of a father character, which this anime is lacking despite being a PARENT and child program, would be enough to double or triple the number of possibilities. <br />
<br />
There’s also the chance of exploring themes about gender roles, sex, and sexuality. Given that the story takes place in a video game it shouldn’t be too far off for a character to change their sex or appearance with a few switches and dials. Imagine for example a story line that has an old fashioned strict parent who joins the game with their child, but the child “Accidentally” became the opposite sex. However the matter of fact would be that the child did it deliberately because they could: 1.gauge how their parent would feel 2. see if the parent can accept them at that moment and 3. slowly indoctrinate them into the liberal gay agenda. Speaking of gays, what if the main character was gay. The anime does show that Mamako is fine with Masato being in a relationship as they do a sort of potential bride interview as a way to recruit party members. While it’s obvious that it’s done as a joke it would be interesting to see what would happen with their relationship if he was gay. Would Mamako be accepting of him? Well of course she would, she’s basically Jesus II . But would a mother like her but not as benevolent be as accepting? Who knows but it would be interesting. <br />
<br />
But that’s enough wallowing of what could have been. Even if the show did these things, given the writing of this show, I doubt it would be even be good.<br />
<br />
As for the production value of the show, it’s all right. The only thing worth of note is the character designs, more specifically their eyes. Their designs were done by an artist named Pochi who’s known for a manga that also focuses on the bonds of an older and younger family members. What makes the characters in this anime distinct is that the characters have white pupils. While having characters with white pupils isn’t anything new, it’s done in wholesale here. While i guess it is cute on the other hand the more you look at it the more uncanny it gets. As you stare at Mamako, her gaze pierces yours as she looks deep inside your soul. And as you try to do the same, you are only met with an endless white void. The abyss stares at you but you aren&#039;t able to stare back. Averting your eyes is the only option and in doing so your are met with her chest. Beautiful maternal breasts that can comfort and soften even the most hardened of people. So yeah, it&#039;s nice shit I guess.<br />
<br />
As I was writing this review I think I finally understood why I was so interested in the themes in this show and why i bothered continuing on. It mainly boils down to there rarely ever being even a modest amount of anime about parent-child relationships. One does pop up every once in a while, but even those aren&#039;t really that focused on parenthood as much as OO is, albeit OO is very preachy about it. I guess it goes to show that writing isn’t the only way to make a show interesting, just having themes and a parent-child relationship that sometime teeters into incest can work just as well.<br />
<br />
Anyway the scoring is a bit skewed because i had to put a 10 on characters so i don&#039;t hurt Mamako&#039;s feelings

    M.I.L.F ISE-KAI<br />
<br />
Well anime comes with wild ideas and goes full throttle with the concept and Tsuujou Kougeki ga Zentai Kougeki de Ni-kai Kougeki no Okaasan wa Suki Desu ka? is no different. As much as Tsuujou Kougeki ga Zentai Kougeki de Ni-kai Kougeki no Okaasan wa Suki Desu ka? has an alienating premise and the &quot;wild ideas&quot; diverting people away from this anime BUT LA saw something with this anime, a core concept at least all the while adding comedy and parodying the isekai genre all in one.<br />
<br />
Well let&#039;s get the &quot;alienating premise&quot; problem out of the way...mainly in the fact that the titular character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318433">
        of the &quot;mom&quot; or in this case Masato Oosuki&#039;s mom Mamako voiced by Ai Kayano gives off a blatant incest-y tone and all the embrassing things that Mamko gets into especially since it&#039;s fanservicey and how clingy Mamako is to Masato is becomes a major problem with the anime and it doesn&#039;t go away. Lastly would be Masato&#039;s behavior at the start of the anime, where he&#039;s extremely stingy towards his mom, sure he DIDN&#039;T want all this but it&#039;s his mom like what the fuck man..thankfully he does get better...or self-aware of the situation he gets and he well...just gets used to it.<br />
<br />
BUT aside from that, Tsuujou Kougeki ga Zentai Kougeki de Ni-kai Kougeki no Okaasan wa Suki Desu ka? does give us some of a refreshing take on the isekai genre, mainly on the fact that...hey A PARENT along with the main protagonist gets transported into another world or in this case a beta test of busted MMORPG mainly focused on moms or familiar bonds (but mainly moms). Through this the main cast mostly have mommy issues that latter joins Masato&#039;s party and goes through the beta test all the while running gags such as Mamako 2 hitting everything. Wise voiced by Sayumi Suzushiro is a proto-Megumin and Aqua where she&#039;s basically useless but highly proficient in magic...just she finds ways to have 0 MP to cast anything, she&#039;s essentially the physical butt monkey of the cast and like Masato has a mom in the game where it becomes the first arc of the anime focusing on Wise&#039;s mom being WAAAY to self-adsorbed with herself and thus Wise, Masato, Mamako and Porta have to &quot;defeat&quot; her and make her a better mom. Ohh Porta voiced by Sayaka Harada the teams items master and joins Masato&#039;s party very early in the anime...not much is known about her besides that. The last party member joining is Medhi voiced by Lynn a white mage healer and with her helicopter mom...Medhimama who strives to do WHATEVER it takes for Medhi to become number one...thus helicopter mom and yeah Medhi gets an arc because of this. Lastly is Masumi Shirase voiced by Satomi Arai, a weak GM who gives Masato&#039;s party &quot;quests&quot; that more or less gets them to &quot;fix bugs&quot; within the game in which Shirase can&#039;t...due to her dying constantly.<br />
<br />
So the central core concept of this anime becomes obvious...parental issues, that of selfish parents like Wise&#039;s to for LA, the much more relatable helicopter mom and her goal of wanting her daughter to become number one no matter the cost, which is something most Asian kids have dealt with or still is, Tsuujou Kougeki ga Zentai Kougeki de Ni-kai Kougeki no Okaasan wa Suki Desu ka? DOES show these concepts quite well and the setting makes sense. What doesn&#039;t is the retributions to some of the &quot;mom villains&quot; of this anime..mainly Wise&#039;s as her retribution was kinda a slap to the wrist than anything else...like seriously, she made Wise&#039;s life hell and THAT&#039;s her consequence.<br />
<br />
The comedy comes in and really where the comedy shines is in it&#039;s parody of the isekai &quot;game genre&quot; as well as how the characters function. Running gags aside just the main cast&#039;s general dichotomy when it comes to their game elements though sometimes repetitive for LA like Wise losing MP or unable to cast anything, Medhi&#039;s dual personality seeping out, Mamako 2 shotting everything, Masato not able to fight because of Mamako, it&#039;s how the game world reacts to Masato&#039;s party or more or less Mamako&#039;s is quite funny let alone how the main cast DO have good chemistry with one another at that too. <br />
<br />
The animation done by JC Staff gives us...well in all honesty..a self-awareness even towards it&#039;s animation due to the fact the setting of this anime is in a beta test MMORPG thus the background characters are intentionally derp and low quality. As for the character designs, they were decent for a fantasy medieval-ish setting and thus goes on with the character costumes. LA doesn&#039;t know the character design animation seemed to have this slight detail to the character eyes...like a certain intense bloom to their irises or something, exotic at least. Overall the animation done by JC Staff was good and somewhat self-aware about it in a charming way instead.<br />
<br />
The voice cast has some veteran and rookie seiyuu&#039;s in their roster, the veteran&#039;s like Ai Kayano as Mamako to Satomi Arai as Masumi to Lynn as Medhi (who has a sorta playing against the type at that) and BOTH of them did great in their respective roles. As for the rookie&#039;s we have Sayaka Harada as Porta, Sayumi Suzushiro as Wise (doing a playing against the type from her previous role as Uruka from Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai). The only voice actor LA really didn&#039;t care about...was Haruki Ishiya as Masao...to be expected as he really didn&#039;t get to do much and was pretty much being the straight man to the rest of the cast but he was still...ehhh..ok. Overall the voice cast was great especially Lynn, Satomi Arai, Ai Kayano and Sayumi Suzushiro.<br />
<br />
LA thinks the only major flaw LA saw was to the near end of the anime with the only non-mom villain of the series and focusing on the constant running gags of not of not the main cast but the minor cast constantly doing their gags while the main cats ar in the background but especially from the main villain it got old fast but LA doesn&#039;t think to tell you it....yeah THAT running gag. Yes the entire concept of the mom 2 hitting things does feel like a running gag in itself but actually Mamako more or less talks the mom villains into submission more than dealing with the villain head on so it has that for a defense. Lastly would be main cast&#039;s running gag and how they stretch it out, to be honest yes they do, but they don&#039;t as the new situations placed them in gives it a new spin one way or another and sometimes it&#039;s not even based on their running gag. The ONLY running gag that sorta dulls it&#039;s welcome quickly is the intentional fanservicey moments mostly involving Mamako because OF COURSE IT DOES... <br />
<br />
Tsuujou Kougeki ga Zentai Kougeki de Ni-kai Kougeki no Okaasan wa Suki Desu ka? has an alienating premise let alone LA wasn&#039;t even thinking this was gonna be a good isekai, but lo and behold LA actually liked this isekai even with it&#039;s incest-y flaws and running gags and all. With a refreshingly different isekai element and it running with it, funny characters let alone their chemistry with one another only making the comedy that much better to a core concept of parental issues towards it&#039;s characters...<br />
<br />
Tsuujou Kougeki ga Zentai Kougeki de Ni-kai Kougeki no Okaasan wa Suki Desu ka? is one crazy annoying adventure with your mom, ohh and from all this...yeah..LA thinks Mamako is a badass adorable character who even with her flaws...does solidify this anime to what is really is...is Mamako the true villain disguised as the ditzy mom of the series???

    This may come as a surprise to some, especially after reading the negative comments about this anime. But I will frankly place this Isekai on the top of every other Isekai that came out this season.<br />
<br />
The reason for that is simple. This anime isn&#039;t meant to be taken seriously. This is more like a gag anime like KonoSuba. And hence I don&#039;t take anything that happens in this seriously either.<br />
<br />
But that not all there is to it. The plot is actually better for a gag anime. Much better than the other Isekais that released this season. Granted there isn&#039;t much plot, the whatever there is,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314464">
        is presented beautifully.<br />
<br />
The artwork is good, so is the animation. And while I might sound like a broken record now, even those two things along with the sound are better than the other Isekais.<br />
<br />
Some characters are indeed generic. Twin tailed Tsudered, check. Excited Mc with a powerful skill, check. But the mothers, they are new. Not when compared to the mothers in all other anime, No. But a mother that is Isekai&#039;d definitely changes the character and give a refreshed feeling.<br />
<br />
A parent and child relation is something not many animes like this have. For people like me, who are watching animes since the 90s, orphaned MCs are actually the norm. So this is indeed refreshing. It provides a good laugh.

    Tsuujou Kougeki ga Zentai Kougeki de Ni-kai Kougeki no Okaasan wa Suki Desu ka? Or  Do You Like Your Mom? Her Normal Attack is Two Attacks at Full Power, in short, Okaasan online has ended.<br />
<br />
So<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
Pros: It maybe you usual isekai themed anime, but, original creator, Inaka, Dachima gave it a tweak by adding a mom on board.<br />
<br />
Cons: It was still you usual isekai themed anime plot, where it was 2 step away of having a worst story plot.<br />
<br />
 Verdict 3/10<br />
<br />
Art<br />
<br />
Pros: It was good that a certain Pochi who designed the characters here to add some fanservices  like that of Wise&#039;s panty flash.<br />
<br />
Cons: It

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318444">
        was the only thing that makes this anime sell.<br />
<br />
Verdict 7/10<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
Pros: Mamako&#039;s voice was just cute and that ending theme &quot;Tsuujou Kougeki ga Zentai Kougeki de Ni-kai Kougeki Mama&quot; by ai Kayano was just soothing, in fact you can sing this to a kid who&#039;s ages from 6 and below.<br />
<br />
Cons: Nothing in particular. <br />
<br />
Verdict 8/10<br />
<br />
Character<br />
<br />
Pros: Unlike the usual Isekai themed anime where it always includes a guy who seemingly does very good in the alternate world , here such guy was replaced by Mamako Oosuki mom of Masato Oosuki where the guy was regulated as a secondary character. <br />
<br />
Cons: Unfortunately, the main protagonist Mamako was still portrayed as the usual protagonist in any other isekai themed anime. in fact she hogged every scene in this anime.  <br />
<br />
Verdict 3/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
<br />
Pros: Well, despite of this having that usual generic isekai themed anime, it was quite enjoyable when we see a mom in the helm of things.<br />
<br />
Cons: She still hogged all the scenes.<br />
<br />
Verdict 8/10<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
<br />
Verdict 3/10<br />
<br />
This is were I get to the ugly point, cu&#039;z only the character in the helm was change, but the anime as a whole was just poor in everything where it all relies on the main character, Mamako and fanservice that were added to sell. IMAO this doesn&#039;t deserve a 2nd season. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

From my perspective, this anime doesn&#039;t focus on the Isekai genre, neither about moms, nor the plot, but rather a very important message that&#039;s directed to the young people.<br />
<br />
Youth these days or should I say years, is more spoiled than it was. And this anime reflects this issue and shows one of the reasons why - Bad parenting and lack of it.<br />
<br />
And this main female character is a good (not exactly perfect though) example of how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318649">
        to be a good parent. By simply spending more time together and knowing the right amount of limits between freedom and discipline for their children.<br />
<br />
To conclude, this show helps you understand that in order to become a good human being, one must know that the things you want in your life do NOT equal the things that you need.

    This show is about Mamako, you will love Mamako it doesn&#039;t matter how, if you love her as a milf, as wanting her to be your mum, as a character, Mamako is the best thing here.<br />
<br />
Taking that aside you are in for a story that doesn&#039;t develop its characters, there was a hint when Wise, the Sage, was introduced, but after that we don&#039;t see Wise develop. Then we get Porta which is the cute one, but she is barely introduced and not developed at all and the last member Medhi that is just as dull as the other two.<br />
<br />
The story follow a episodic structure

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318458">
        where most episodes don&#039;t rely on prior, which can be good, but the &quot;getting close to your mother&quot; main objective falls flat on earth and we feel like the show goes nowhere.<br />
<br />
Ma-kun, the protagonist, is forgettable, one or two moments he shows he has some brains but mostly he is complaining about his OP mum.<br />
<br />
Mamako doesn&#039;t change much from the first episode, but she is so likeable that you end up not caring and craving for more &quot;maaa-kuuuun&quot;, if it wasn&#039;t for her there wouldn&#039;t be a show at all.

    I’d like to think it was fairly obvious from as early on as the initial promotional materials of Okaasan that this wasn’t going to be a high-quality, well-written ride. But, of course, anime doesn’t have to be classy to be entertaining. So let me ask this question instead: which audiences will Okaasan entertain, and will it be worth your time?<br />
<br />
The answers are very few, and probably not. Only a very specific audience will be able to overlook the serious flaws of Okaasan.<br />
<br />
Story: 1/10<br />
<br />
The story of Okaasan starts out as standard Isekai fare, but quickly devolves into a strange, contrived-even-for-Isekai mess. Many of the problems Masato

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318662">
        and party face should have been nuked at the dev level. What are the devs of Okaasan Online doing, letting this conga line of deranged griefers do as they please, quite literally threatening to break the game for everyone else? It’s baffling that they lack any sense of PR and any sense of protecting their own assets.<br />
<br />
The intra-party conflict moments are marginally better, but still rely on unrealistic and nonsensical anime logic to create and solve problems. Absence of internal logic is a running theme in this anime. <br />
<br />
Art: 4/10<br />
<br />
Not much to say about the art of Okaasan. It’s standard fare for low budget animations. It isn’t particularly offensive in any way, and that makes it one of the best parts of the show. The designs are nothing special, but they’re nice to look at in a vacuum, when the characters aren’t making you want to smack your head against the wall.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10<br />
<br />
Again, not much to say. The opening and ending are not stellar, but they are mildly catchy. Insert tracks fit well enough with their scenes as to not be a bother.<br />
<br />
Character: 1/10<br />
<br />
This is another category where Okaasan utterly fails. Unfortunately, the characters of Okaasan are less characters as much as they are a loose collection of tropes from better characters, written with the consistency one might expect if a different schoolchild were assigned to each episode, were given a loose character outline, and asked to write a story. Mamako herself is the worst offender in this sense, her poor self-awareness varying wildly from episode to episode, from bad, to lethal, to just plain stupid, to even stupider yet. But, every character suffers from this lack of consistency to some degree. <br />
<br />
Worse yet is the utter unlikability of what little consistent traits there are. You’ll want to smack Masato for being a whiny prick to his mother and everyone else. After a while, you’ll want to smack Mamako for enabling Masato’s entitled behavior. Then, you’ll want to smack the devs for apparently being content to let other players run muck-wild, brainwashing and enslaving other players, among other things. And so on and so forth.<br />
<br />
There’s one more problem with the characters of Okaasan, the problem of how rotten behavior in general is universally dealt with. Several mothers and children in this show are downright abusive to their other half, and every single time the show doesn’t even slap the abuser on the wrist, sometimes going explicitly out of the way to say it isn’t their fault they’ve done such awful things. Every single time. Because I guess Mama’s love is all, amirite? Strangely, said characters are put on a bus before they get a chance to relapse...<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1/10<br />
<br />
There was no enjoyment to be found in this wasteland of a show. Okaasan’s writing is undeniably bottom-of-the-barrel garbage. The very best thing it can show for itself is its low-tier art and mediocre sound. Watching the show at all is an exercise in masochism.<br />
<br />
So, in conclusion, who should watch this show?<br />
<br />
If you are seriously horny for Mamako, then go for it, but don’t say I didn’t warn you that it’s bad.<br />
<br />
If you came looking for a corny Isekai adventure, stay far away and don’t come back. There’s nothing funny or amusing about Okaasan in the slightest and it’ll only leave you feeling incredulous and angry.<br />
<br />
If, for some reason, you purposely want to watch a terrible anime, then look no further. This is the one for you.<br />
<br />
Overall, 1/10.

    Dude... this show... it&#039;s bad... and so stupid...<br />
Every element, characters, story, comedy, etc, is executed so poorly, so boring and generic. It tries to be funny, but it fails to the point of being cringy. The show wants to be something but doesn&#039;t know how to do it, they just simply use every cliche of isekai anime and tries to parody them but it also fails in that.<br />
<br />
The main cast are flat, predictible and with no personality or charisma. Mamako is literally Jesus, Masato is the tragic pathetic guy who wishes to be a hero in an incredible adventure, Wise is the tsundere one, Medhi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318491">
        is the malicius one who seems being the perfect grill, and Porta (yeah perdonen kamehameha) it&#039;s just the adorable one.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s ton of elements throughout story that makes no sense, the mama-villains are bad because a strange rock (that doesn&#039;t justify they are horrible mothers in real life), every power of mamako just appear conveniently from nowhere to reslove every problem, why there is a school in a mmorpg and a tedious arc about it?, and Shirase and the people responsible of this game are the most usless because they cannot get rid of the problems of overpower players. Excuse but what the fuck? why the fuck you can&#039;t fix those problems if you are the creators of this unbalanced game? Also, the last villain is just a tiring unidimensional comic relief.<br />
<br />
The art is acceptable I guess, the animation is mediocre as modern anime, but the sound and music are soooooo boring and generic.<br />
<br />
You know what&#039;s the worst thing of all? This show could be way better than the final product. The premise is so stupid and hilarious that the writers wasted and ended doing poor generic comedy trying to be a parody... and even the writters of konosuba could use this potential and create a comedy as fun as konosuba. I really wanted to have fun with this anime but instead I had more fun hating it and talking to myself how bad this show was.<br />

    This anime is... it is really something else. On the surface this anime doesn&#039;t seem so bad, especially from the first episode. I didn&#039;t have high hopes for this anime, but I figured I&#039;d get enough enjoyment out of it since it was an isekai. Oh no, how wrong I was. This anime, more specifically the horrific writing of the story, is what is wrong with with this anime. It makes me furious on so many levels because of how bad the writing is. When you actually start breaking down the world of this anime, you learn just how messed up the writing is.<br />

~SPOILER WARNING~<br />
There

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314578">
        is going to be some spoilers to help get my thoughts across. This is going to be a long one, I hope you are comfy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 1/10 <br />
This would be the first anime I would objectively give a negative score. This is the area that completely ruined the anime. The game in the anime seems to have a noble goal of repairing the broken bond between a mother and her child. In theory, this is a great goal, but the way the game executes it is absolutely appalling. It disgusts me to no end with how evil the design of the game is. The underlying idea that serves as the driving force of the so called &quot;repairing the broken bond&quot; is actually the idea that the child needs to learn to submission to their parent. Don&#039;t believe me? Let&#039;s break it down with the story we have so far. <br />
Right before their adventure, Masato and Mamako get their class and stats. Here&#039;s the deal breaker that is easily missed, Masato is your typical level 1 starting with 3 STR, while his mom starts with 401 STR, over 100 times higher than her son&#039;s. What&#039;s more to boot, Masato get&#039;s one legendary sword while his mom GET&#039;S TWO. It&#039;s every gaming child&#039;s dream to play in the virtual world, but you know what? The child isn&#039;t the MC in THEIR OWN ADVENTURE, it&#039;s their mom. Realistically, right from the beginning it&#039;s painfully obvious that the child needs to just admit that they aren&#039;t the spotlight of their own story. It would be okay if they had to share the spotlight with their mom, but no, we have to take it a step further by slapping them across the face and kicking them right off the podium because they are actually a supporting character. So the child is being forced to learn that he has to give in to the parent. Now why am I saying all of this? I could be reading too much into the beginning scene, which I partially am. But what solidifies my suspicions is in Episode 4, where we see another child, Wise, confront her mother. Long story short, Wise&#039; mom is an absolute b**** and it is downright insulting to all mothers in the world by calling her a mom. The goal of the game is to &quot;repair the bond&quot; right? Well on the surface it seems to have happened, until you look at the details and realize its not. At the end of Wise&#039;s little story arc, Wise finally gives in and apologizes to her mother. She cries and opens her heart for her mom to see, asking for forgiveness for her childish decisions (but remember, she&#039;s a child), but this is all once sided because her Mom doesn&#039;t say a word. No apology, no repentance, just a couple of tears as her daughter is finally submitting to her mom. What was the final verdict? The GMs decide that the mom is suddenly forgiven for her actions and that Wise and her mom&#039;s relationship is &quot;fixed&quot;. Wise&#039;s mom is allowed to log off. WHAT THE HELL??!?! <br />
Time to go off on a little tangent, but it pertains to my review so let&#039;s go. What makes a bad child is a bad parent. In some way, shape or form, the parent is responsible for how their child came out. The parent has a part to play regarding everything in a child&#039;s life. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m not condoning helicopter parents, but it is the parents duty to teach the child right from wrong using more than just words. Yeah, a parent can&#039;t control who their child hangs out with, but they can teach their child the dangers in life such as drugs. A parent cannot and should not make the decisions of their child, but they can educate them properly so they do not get easily influenced to make bad decisions. Parenting is two things, communication and presentation. Communication is key for your child to understand how to get through life and more importantly, understand why you are presenting yourself the way you do. It&#039;s simple psychology honestly, but many care less to educate themselves so that in turn they can educate their children.<br />
Let&#039;s go back to Wise, or Genya. What&#039;s her underlying motive for action such a way to her mother? It&#039;s because of how her mother treated her all the years she&#039;s been alive. She has an improper name, her mother always flakes off and does things half-heartedly, and her mother childishly gives into her fantasy. Wise has THE RIGHT to get angry, she doesn&#039;t know what to do and was never taught how to react to the situation, plus she is still a child. But you know what, Wise is the only one who must sacrifice herself to repair the bond with her mother. She is more mature than her mother will ever be, but the story forgives ALL of the actions her mom did, and even pardons her from the game and the fine for illegal usage. So clearly the rift in the relationship between a mother and her child is the fault of the child only, clearly nothing to do with the mother. This... this makes my blood boil even as I write this review. Holy hell the morality of the writing infuriates me to no end, its almost as if the writer(s?) supports the whole &quot;the parent is always right&quot; idea. Morales are so bad in this writing, it absolutely destroys any semblance of potential this anime could have.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
The art is actually pretty spectacular. Pochi. is a very good artist and seeing his work here has me delighted. Why do I only give it a 7? The action scenes are a bit of a let down, the animation drops in quality when it comes to the action.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10<br />
Nothing bad here, but nothing amazing. Nothing to comment on really, the music and sounds work, and they fit.<br />
<br />
Character: 3/10<br />
Tropes. Tropes. Tropes. Nothing new, nothing unique. Nothing is created beyond the tropes, even 4 episodes in. Though, most of the characters are likable enough so that is a plus, its the only hope I can have for character development.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1/10 <br />
It started as a 6 with the first episode, then a 5, then a 3, and finally ending on 1. Need I say more? See the story section.<br />
<br />
Overall: 2/10<br />
Personally, the writing absolute did it for me. It was so bad that my overall score for the anime will not be the average of each section. Episode 4 hit the nail on the head, and it was over for me. As a person who studies psychology, is practically a full-time babysitter, and looking to start a family in 5 years time, the setup of this anime absolutely disgusts me. This was the first anime I dropped by how bad it is, and I am open to watching just about any anime. I&#039;ve watched many bad anime and gotten through them, but I&#039;ve never watched one that supports such a detestable method of parenting. I simply gave this anime a 2 because the other parts of the anime are actually good enough for a decent anime. To give you an idea of how upset this anime made me, I made my first account on MAL and wrote my first review on MAL for this anime just to get my opinions out there, and I&#039;ve been an avid anime watcher for over 10 years and going. I never felt the need to have a MAL account despite always using it all this time, I guess now I can put it to use.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not here to tell you can&#039;t watch this anime, but I&#039;m here to tell you its not worth the watch, especially if you love to deep dive into the lore of an anime world.
