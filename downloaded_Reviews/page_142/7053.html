    The review contains spoilers<br />
<br />
<br />
While waiting for someone to write a positive review about this, I thought I&#039;d wake up because that won&#039;t happen, so I guess I should do it myself. I find 7 to be above average, not something I&#039;d recommend, but it&#039;s good compared to the hate this show is getting, and I actually like it. So there may be spoilers because no one cares about a show with this low of a rating, right? <br />
<br />
The story with its mysteries and use of time travel is stunning, it&#039;s all connected and covers up most of its plot-holes (not really all though). The way

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289173">
        Setsuna wants to save someone, which is later implied to be Rinne, the way the Island repeats itself, the way Kuon is revealed to be the future Rinne. It all felt smoothly connected, believable, and most of all, shocking. Even I was surprised by how an overhated anime can shock me with its twists, but surprisingly it surprised me. But that does not mean it is without issues. The ending where saving Rinne is neglected kind of was off the point, but I can&#039;t say after that big shock that I cared enough. It still dropped my scoring a bit, in addition to the Never Island segments having copies of the Island segment, that was hard to believe. Ignoring the flaws, I believe the story is the strongest point in the series, but its minimal flaws make me rate it a 7.<br />
<br />
Songs by Rinne&#039;s seiyuu are really nice to hear, I love the seiyuu. Insert songs are also well made, no complaints. Art looks nice, which is something even the haters can agree on.<br />
<br />
And I bet we all can agree that the characters are flat. They were used as plot devices, and if the plot wasn&#039;t good, this series would be as forgettable as School Days. Even though they are bland, I did not really dislike them, nor like them. The 3 main girls are cute with cute voices, and Setsuna with his manly seiyuu, not much to complain about, but I did rate the characters a 5. The show would be an easy 8/10 with stronger characterization.<br />
<br />
Obviously after everything I said, I did enjoy the show. Characters do not really affect enjoyment, and enjoyment is the main reason we watch anime, right? So it&#039;s not wrong to ignore certain flaws if you enjoyed a show. You do not have to agree with me, after all, I like SAO. But I could name 50 shows better than SAO and Island, so even if they are good in my opinion, you can find better, but you can give this a try.

    Ever wondered what would be like to wake up and have no memories about yourself? Island takes this traditional trope but instead of translating it into a survival tale, it turns it into a story about rediscovery. It’s a series based on a visual novel but I confess to say that it’s very questionable in terms of presentation. Looking at the show made me wonder how such a simple premise descended into an abomination.<br />
<br />
The simple premise of Island honestly made me curious about the show at first. Taking place on this island known as “Urashima”, it gives the impression of a setting of isolation. It’s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289160">
        away from cities, civilizations, and the social problems that we have to deal in our everyday lives. In fact, the first few episodes really makes it clear that the islanders there live in a carefree way. However, it didn’t take long for me to realize that there’s more than meets the eye about the story’s mystery. A big part of the show is trying to sell its suspenseful plot by connecting the past with the present. <br />
<br />
Before I actually get into the juicy part of the show, it’s noticeable that Island underwent some changes before the actual premiere. From my understanding, there was dispute over the script so what we see on TV may not be what was originally planned. I have not played the visual novel (even though it’s available now in both Japanese and English) so I came into the show as a fresh newbie. Still, a show like this felt more like a niche designed to target the specific audience. In this case, it’s aimed at people who enjoys the feeling of a dramatic adventure. And to be honest, that’s a tough pill to swallow. The first few episodes flirted with relationships between the main cast. Meanwhile, the story suffers pacing issues from the very start as each episode constantly bounces between cheesy comedy and dramatic sequences. Then, there’s the mystery that tries to carry the plot. What we get instead is more of a wish-fulfillment love story that doesn’t know what it’s trying to do. There’s a lot of pitfalls that hardly puts emphasis on the story. This is evidenced with the sex jokes, ineffective writing, and in general, lack of care in the characterization.<br />
<br />
Speaking of characters, Setsuna Sanzenkai is what I like to describe as a blank piece of paper. You try to write down facts about him and there’s really nothing. That’s because the guy has a mysterious past but in reality, his personality is just as empty. Through his interactions with the main cast, he doesn’t stand out any more than they do. It doesn&#039;t help that his dialogues sounds robotic and often lacks enthuaism. The main cast consists of three girls – Rinne, Karen, and Sara. Each of them seems to have some sort of connection with Setsuna as evidenced through various flashbacks. The show also dedicates a decent amount of screen time by using montages to enhance their relationships. Unfortunately, it fails to cook up any meaningful relationship between Setsuna and these girls. There’s too much generalization on the girls’ personalities and much less on their development. Even Rinne, the girl that Setsuna spends the most time with suffers from this. Sure, there is background storytelling that makes it clear he and Rinne knows more about each other than meets the eye. However, it’s the type of relationship that adheres to wish-fulfillment. These characters are not larger than life and in fact, you can find them in just about any eroge visual novel. It’s a shame really since they look charming on the surface.<br />
<br />
So is there anything worth watching about the show? To be honest, it’s really comes down to the decision on what you’ll find attractive or not. The comedy is blatantly inauthentic with poor timing between the characters’ dialogues. While the show had potential for its mystery elements, it really doesn’t get the ride going until quite later on. In other words, this anime will test your patience. I’ve honestly struggled to stay awake when watching Island and this show felt like it would be better if you played the game. <br />
<br />
Perhaps there’s some redeeming quality about the show when it comes to the technical quality. I have to admit, Island does look well designed in terms of its setting. It’s able to convince me of the cultural differences between itself and the outside world. The idea of isolationism also looks credible with the relaxing atmosphere and being away from urban cities. Characters all look like they live the carefree life with their simple clothing and moderate technology. There’s also quite an abundance of fanservice that may sometimes feel uncomfortable. Because let’s face it, some of the girls in the show looks like kids. You be the judge but it’s hard to deny their physical appearances.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Front Wing was able to create this series with a very relaxing and atmospheric music. While the montage songs can sound a bit generic, they are also appealing by itself if you just listen to them. Unfortunately, the show definitely takes a step back when it comes to voice acting. I already mentioned Setsuna but his voice really sounds like a cog in a machine when he opens his mouth. The female characters’ voices doesn’t sound any better and often too high pitched to take to heart. <br />
<br />
I’m glad this show is only 1 cour because any more than that would feel like a chore. To be able to attract an audience towards this show takes more than just a creative setting. The premise had some potential but it’s weathered down by its ineffective plot and one dimensional characters. Perhaps if I watch this without thinking too much, it would’ve been a better experience. The fact is, Island is just another example of a poor story with a budget that it doesn’t deserve.

    There are certain shows that have the potential to be a hentai.<br />
I am not joking. You know, the vast empty spaces, the lone male character, and finally the girls that throw themselves at him.<br />
Imagine a perfect hentai setting: an isolated island, a male that lost his memory, and three girls that take turns in persuading him to, and I quote directly from the show, &quot;mess them up&quot;. Add to this setting a little bit of mystery, the shadow of a plot, and there you have it: Island (minus the hentai).<br />
The sad part is, upon watching the first episode, I thought &quot;This has the potential to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284508">
        be a really interesting anime!&quot;. The visuals were very well done, the sound was heavenly, the sceneries were awesome, and the premise of a mysterious event that doomed an island sold me. As I continued watching, it all went downhill.<br />
The main character is a cardboard. Scratch that. He is less than that. His role in the anime is to pop up at random moments during convenient times. He has no depth, no personality, nothing. <br />
The three main girls are walking clichées. <br />
We have the tsundere &quot;baka!&quot; orange haired girl, the loli that they managed to sexualize without the F.B.I breaking their door, and finally the hypersensitive deep white-haired girl. <br />
Let&#039;s talk about the plot. <br />
Done. <br />
Oh, we haven&#039;t? That&#039;s because it&#039;s nonexistent. <br />
The main character talks with the other three girls, and each time they mention something about a bad event, time travel, and the need to leave or change the future. That&#039;s it. Nothing goes forward <br />
The problem is, it only seems to get worse throughout each episode. <br />
This is easily a droppable anime, but I will finish watching it since it&#039;s only a total of twenty minutes per week and I need my weekly dose of cringe.<br />

    The Summer 2018 season is wrapping up slowly and it&#039;s that time again.<br />
<br />
Today, I will be reviewing Island, an anime with time travel, romance and lolis!<br />
<br />
Story (1/10)<br />
<br />
Island had a really terrible story.<br />
<br />
The writing immediately suffers from absurd pacing where it either goes too slow with nothing happening at all, or goes too fast with major plot twists and elements failing to work due to being rushed to hell.<br />
<br />
And whatever content that was given, was super boring and for a guy that loves SciFi shows a lot, this did not interest me one bit.<br />
<br />
It felt like they were writing this anime but it had no soul

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289175">
        to it, since shit just occured with no real heart put into it.<br />
<br />
Overall, a very boring, lackluster and terribly paced story that had to be one of the most boring SciFi stories I have ever witnessed.<br />
<br />
Characters (1/10)<br />
<br />
Setsuna was not the worst character ever. He ain&#039;t annoying nor a dick.<br />
<br />
He was just a guy. Didn&#039;t feel anything for him but he isn&#039;t bad.<br />
<br />
And the girls also feel very generic and the relationships between Setsuna and all the girls lack a lot of depth to it, with poor writing to blame.<br />
<br />
Rinne looks cute but was nowhere engaging for me as a character and Karen &amp; Sara were just there too.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation (7/10)<br />
<br />
feel. did not make this look as good as Hinamatsuri last season, but the art looks very good with some nice character designs.<br />
<br />
Sound (6/10)<br />
<br />
The OP and ED songs weren&#039;t that great but the OST was really nice and fitting for this show, especially its calm songs.<br />
<br />
However, the voice acting was not good for me.<br />
<br />
Rinne and Karen&#039;s voices felt off for me as they sound too striking for their characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (1/10)<br />
<br />
Yawn.<br />
<br />
Island was a massive letdown and a poorly written show from the get go. One of the weakest shows of this season and year for sure.<br />
<br />
Score 1/10

    This anime, I daresay, is the BEST ANIME EVER.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re reading this review, you have been most likely guided by fate. After all, this gem is hidden in the vast sea of hidden gems, as if you&#039;re trying to find a certain hydrogen atom in the vast universe.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, there are anime that people recommend to me. They were nice, I enjoyed them, and I gave them the usual 10. There are also anime that I randomly come upon which I enjoy more than those recommended to me. Island is one of those anime, but the feeling it left me is more than just enjoyment—more than

          <span style="display: none;" id="review359932">
        just what any word can describe. Thrill? Pleasure? Entertainment? Amusement? I can&#039;t really say. Like I said before, it&#039;s the best anime ever. A score as low as a 10 will not suffice. Before I continue, this review will not include spoilers, but some plot points will be inferred based on how I&#039;m going to describe them. Rest easy, though—I&#039;m doing this to make anyone reading this very, very interested, sharing my ideas and feelings, supporting my statement above.<br />
<br />
The story begins with a man who washed ashore Urashima, a habited island far from the mainland. He doesn&#039;t remember anything, not even his name, aside from his claims that he is a time traveler from the future who has a mission to save the world and a certain girl from harm. Nightfall comes and he meets Rinne Ohara, a girl singing a tune familiar to him, making him remember a specific name, which is Setsuna. Believing that to be his name, he adopts it. Rinne, however, knows another &quot;Setsuna.&quot; Hoping the man she just met is that same Setsuna in her memories, she took him home as a servant. Setsuna, in the meantime, while trying to regain his memories, soon discovers the mysterious past and legends the island of Urashima has, and soon enough, it begins to delve into something more complicated as time goes by.<br />
<br />
The story is very, very interesting. What happens in the early episodes is nothing like how the story progresses over time, and this story is the foremost reason why I say that this anime is the utter best. The execution at first is poor, and the pacing is very slow. However, it&#039;s not really stretched because Island does have a very magnificent development. If one were to analyze how the story goes, the &quot;slow pace&quot; is necessary, especially that when talking about plots where the main character&#039;s memories are gone, something like remembering it all afterwards is not something you rush into. This kind of development required the long episodes of preparation as to signify the better things that this anime has to offer. Do you plan to drop it on episode 8? Sure, it may seem that the plot should have been finally developed at that stage, but for this anime, it is still too early. Try to think of it as a lengthy exposition—you&#039;re still nowhere near the climax, and dropping it at that stage makes you miss something you should have invested more time for.<br />
<br />
I could argue that I could have been bored while watching it, but in total honesty, I sacrificed sleep just to watch it. I don&#039;t need sleep, I need answers! When is Setsuna going to remember everything? Is Setsuna the same Setsuna who Rinne knows? What happens if he&#039;s going to remember it all? It was a rollercoaster of emotions throughout and it helped me see to it that I finish the anime. I admit that it was kind of a loli bait, but the story is not a mere CGDCT (cute girl doing cute things) or a slice of life. Like what I have been saying earlier, it has a plot—one of the best ones I have ever seen in my entire life. Considering this was directed by Keiichirou Kawaguchi who also directed Mayo Chiki, I expected some sort of ecchi scenes, but even if there was none, I am fully impressed.<br />
<br />
The characters&#039; personalities were as well-written as the story as well. Each of the four main characters—Rinne, Setsuna, Sara, and Karen—had their own character developments which developed quite nicely. For example, Setsuna is a kind man and continues to be kind as time passes. However, this doesn&#039;t mean that he&#039;s a flat character. What he goes through as the anime goes on is just one of the proofs that he is more than just a man with amnesia. Each of the characters have their own backgrounds that, while I admit is not that unique, blends in with the story as a whole. Think of it as ingredients for a well-cooked cuisine. The ingredients can be used on another serving, but it doesn&#039;t mean that the food will be equally delicious as the previous one—even if they share the exact same amount. Not because Setsuna is amnesiac means that he&#039;s the same as other anime amnesiacs. Karen may be your usual child with parental issues, but it doesn&#039;t mean that she&#039;s the same as other children with the exact same issues as well. That&#039;s how Island&#039;s characters blend so well together.<br />
<br />
Once again, I admit that I was baited by the cute girls in the illustrations. That&#039;s why I say that the art is good. Not only that—the sceneries one can see on the lush and tropical island of Urashima gives off that rural aura that makes you want to take a vacation there or whatnot. The character designs are really good as well, and I must note that the studio that adapted this was very faithful to the visual novel design. Just look at Garandou Sara&#039;s large hair that resembles a tumbleweed. Is it ridiculous? Yes! But it&#039;s also has its charms that I actually loved it so much. Setsuna&#039;s character design reminds me of Kamijou Touma from Toaru Majutsu no Index, and with their similarity in personality, I don&#039;t mind it. Rinne kind of looks like a child version of Enterprise from Azur Lane and remembering Enty&#039;s famous line &quot;OWARI DA!&quot; hits too hard once the plot kicks in. Karen is Karen. She&#039;s also cute. That&#039;s all there is to it. <br />
<br />
The musical themes were quite splendid as well. The opening themes and ending themes were so melodic and pleasing to the ear that I have a folder dedicated to them, and I listen to all of them on loop while doing something, because I always want to sing alongside those themes. The songs really symbolize where the plot is going. If you can understand Japanese, the better you&#039;ll understand that the songs are very meaningful and it&#039;s not just there for show. For example, the opening theme entitled &quot;Eien no Hitotsu&quot; and its chorus that goes in English as: <br />
<br />
&quot;As if you&#039;re hugging me, under the summer&#039;s light, wherever you may be, I want you to look for me. I don&#039;t want to let go both of our hearts so true, and anytime this truth will always be the one that&#039;s true and that will never fade!&quot;<br />
<br />
This is just my independent translation and might not be accurate because I worded it so anyone can sing it word for word, but the essence of the song is still there. It&#039;s very amazing how this song resonated the anime as a whole and still preserves the feelings one can feel about it.<br />
<br />
The enjoyment factors I felt from this anime is not just mere enjoyment. Like how I worded my previous paragraphs, no word can describe how I felt. I am not just happy nor sad about the development, and I am really far from disappointment. I found it really enjoyable, but I can&#039;t stop crying as to how amazingly executed the scenes were. Of course, I didn&#039;t really cry like a baby, but there is something you call &quot;post-anime depression,&quot; where I felt like any other anime became subpar as soon as I finished it. I even went as far as scoring all my anime as 9 in MAL afterwards due to how good the anime really is. But then I realized, rating 9 on anything is not me. However, even if all anime in my list is a 10, the 10 I gave Island as a score really just doesn&#039;t suit it, considering how excellent it is. I have felt post-anime depression before, such as from Shinchou Yuusha and Da Capo, but this one takes the cake. I could write an entire term paper about the amazing characteristics of this anime, and if this goes on, I feel like I&#039;m going to create a paradox, and that&#039;s just scratching the surface of this great and wonderful masterpiece.<br />
<br />
After this anime, I don&#039;t think anything will be as satisfactory as an anime as this one. I can continue giving 10s, but my most special 10 is for this anime, and by watching it you can understand why. Its charm is not something one could fully experience when watching episodically, but by binging it in one go. If you ever find this review, please consider this as my recommendation on how to watch it. Watch it in one go—do not let anything distract you. Finish it even if you think it&#039;s boring. After all, time will tell all secrets.<br />
<br />
Oh yes, I haven&#039;t played the visual novel. I&#039;m quite scared, to be perfectly honest. <br />

    This anime is a serious problem onto itself: promising us with the light-hearted romance turned dark-esque story with the time travel mechanics, but converting about 30 to 50 hours of play into a 12 episode series (which is honestly a no-go for VN fans and anime-onlys who has watched numerous VNs like myself).<br />
<br />
With it, this is a in-depth look on the controversial series called Island, and this review will be long as molasses (don&#039;t worry there&#039;s a TL;DR summary):<br />
<br />
The VN was created by Frontwing, who has done the Grisaia series, with 8-bit&#039;s adaptation in 2014 raking in massive success. This is the 2nd attempt that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289165">
        the company has done this (for their 15th anniversary) to promote the Eng Sub game by using the anime adaptation from studio Feel. Unfortunately, people who have played the Japanese version saw emerging red-flags from the get-go, with similar resonance and dissuasive implications with anime-onlys that this is a bad-ass poor adaptation of the game. The most obvious would be that its gameplay is based on narratives and dialogues, but somehow even the anime adaptation could screw that.<br />
<br />
So yeah, a game that the company advertises Island as a &quot;momentary and eternal fairy tale&quot;? There are few scenes here and there, but I don&#039;t really think so.<br />
<br />
So, going through the story background (and indeed from the game itself):<br />
The &quot;Island&quot; of Urashima, one that has been heavily under suspicion on the tales of the 3 main girls (Rinne, Karen, Sara) and their family traditions in the span of 5 years. Oppressed under misfortune and cut from the mainland in order not to spread the curse around, in comes a guy who is aptly named Setsuna Sanzenkai. Formerly a nameless guy who comes from the future to kill and save someone, that is washed up ashore naked and questioned about his motives, but everything else to him is satisfactory. His main mission is to not let the recurring memories happen, and save everyone from the misery of the curse by doing some time-traveling on his way.<br />
<br />
From there, criticism level 1: The story exists on 3 platforms (SPOILER WARNING): <br />
The initial start but quickly dull and boring &quot;Stage&quot; (Ep 1-7);<br />
The seriously rushed &quot;Recursion&quot; (Ep 8-10);<br />
and the quickly made &quot;to feel like the ending&quot; &quot;Jump&quot; (Ep 11 and 12). <br />
<br />
Aside from information that was cut out from the VN, don&#039;t bother to use the 3-episode rule because the story gets stranger every proceeding episode. The cheaply-made time-travel mechanism just made the whole series look like utter crap with confusion on the progression and beyond...and that&#039;s not all. An example would be when the time-traveling scenes came, the timeline was confusing. Only those who are able to discern the events within that period, were able to understand and enjoy/hate the predictability of the series going forward.<br />
<br />
The characters...all are strikingly similar (at least the girls), so the point that looking at them reminded me of shows like Kodomo no Jikan: An adult-looking guy wanting to get dirty with the children pedophile lolis. And don&#039;t you dare try to sneak away by the thought that the characters have something unique to them, because they don&#039;t. They solely exist to fulfill the narratives and plot points from the game, and seemingly similar to the anime adaptation. Think about it: <br />
<br />
Karen wants to leave Urashima to find out what really happened to her biological mom;<br />
Sara is like a psychologist with all the charts, diagrams and whatnot, and questioning of past and future events;<br />
Rinne has Soot Blight Syndrome (cannot stand under sunlight, it&#039;s a premontioned curse) and is like an owl, only active at night, and searching for the TRUE Setsuna, the one who has been with her before &quot;his&quot; disappearance 5 years ago;<br />
Setsuna is there for the 3 girls to fill in the plot &quot;holes&quot; for them and get theirs and Urashima&#039;s problems solved, while working as a servant for Rinne.<br />
<br />
So...criticism level 2:<br />
None of the characters, yet alone the MC guy or loli girls are engaging nor interesting to follow. All of them are &quot;walking&quot; cliches. Their dialogue just made it seem like there&#039;s a narrative leading to plot points located around the strange Island, and the &quot;going about everyday issues&quot; thing don&#039;t really click all that well, accounting for the many issues that made this series much less enjoyable to begin with. You want some romance? It&#039;s minimalistic at best. Typical VNs will have sorta-based harems, but this one made the troupe seem far too conventional, like it is the last thing the producers want the characters to end up with.<br />
<br />
One issue I would like to address (if that ever calms your displeasing qualms about the show):<br />
The VAs however...through they remain the same as is with the game, Sara&#039;s in-game VA Rie Murakawa has been changed to Hibiku Yamamura for the anime due to disputes between her parent agency against the production committee. The full bio&#039;s on ANN if you want to check it out (because it seems like a big issue to fans of the VN).<br />
The criticism though: All of them felt very muted and out of character, as much as they reprised their characters from the game, the exact feeling is barely fleshed out in the anime, and that is literally quite sad.<br />
<br />
Now, let&#039;s get on with the good stuff:<br />
The art and animation by studio Feel is bright, gorgeous and beautiful to look at, and no, I&#039;m not saying that Feel is a studio that you can count on for VN adaptations. Just take a look at Yosuga no Sora in 2010 and you can see why (same type of adaptation but much enjoyable to watch). Such stuff like the scenes of reflecting water upon the beach and the soft touché background made this watchable to a degree, your mileage may vary. But for Island, striking art and good animation just doesn&#039;t do justice to warrant a series that&#039;s worth watching. With that said, I applaud the producers for good effort done to get the anime as close to the VN source as possible.<br />
<br />
Easily the best part about Island, is undoubtedly the music, or the OST rather, and it&#039;s rare that we get a double-take of both the OP and ED for a 1-cour show. Since the events of Island happen within different timelines, it&#039;s considerable that the OST has to be confined to the overall presentation, and what we&#039;re given makes it for one of the best OSTs this season has to offer: the voice talent of Yukari Tamura (from Last Song) for the OPs and Asaka&#039;s amazing rhythmic-feeling EDs. Honestly, I would be much better just listening to the OST alone than watching this show (and you should, too).<br />
<br />
In the end, the million-dollar question is: Should you watch Island?<br />
Granted, most people&#039;s criticisms with this show are far more or less than what I can cover here, and that&#039;s to an insane degree.  If you like the Kodomo no Jikan feels of &quot;big&quot; guy and loli sex-induced fanservice, I&#039;m sorry but you&#039;re not gonna find it here.<br />
<br />
If you want the TL;DR though: again, it&#039;s a poor adaptation of the VN with a whole lot of nothing. I was certainly looking forward to watch this, but ended up burning myself at the 3-episode rule and giving this another shot (after prelim review)...and yeap, I don&#039;t wanna come back again.<br />
<br />
This is just another shot at making VN adaptations the cream of the crap ton of anime, and doesn&#039;t bode well either. The more deep the progress, the more insane those let-it-be ideas come and gradually, all sense is lost altogether. Skip this and just proceed onto better VNs like Clannad and the such. But yeah, I&#039;d much rather watch sex shows like Yosuga no Sora more.

    My note for the page is 10, but my valuation is really 7.8<br />
Is an anime with tints of mystery and a future (or a past) to tell about a protagonist with amnesia, at first glance it looks like a harem, but it isn&#039;t its focus principal to deal with the romance, if not of the protagonist&#039;s intermissions with the main girls, which are interrelated through their families and a legend that has a argument weight on the plot of the story.<br />
At the beginning the exhibition of the island is interesting and gives rise to varied situations, the style and personality of the main girls in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285077">
        my personal taste what most attracts me to keep watching it, but thinking about it cold, the plot and the history of background do not seem to reach something deep or relevant.<br />
The music and atmosphere are cozy, and seeing how the protagonist discovers his past is quite entertaining, it is not an anime that I would recommend to everybody, but I am particularly entertained and it seems to me the most remarkable thing of the season.

    Island an aberration for some, an acceptable series for few. For me, Island is a series that delivered a different story from the average anime and is more interesting than the generic seasonal series. Is it bad? Is it good? The answer is none; the anime is acceptable, it has good points and some disgusting events that mislead the spectator but in the end, I enjoyed the story. <br />
<br />
Perhaps the biggest grotesque event of this series is in episode 9. It helps to add fire to the opposition that considered Island as a pedophilic vessel, in my case, I got angry because those scenes are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289514">
        just fanservice and are not needed. However, the show isn&#039;t searching to do that, but those events are disgusting and generate a repulsion towards the series. It is wrong saying that any spectator who watches Island is a pedophilic lover. The biggest mistake is the look of the characters but after paying attention to the plot, the age of the characters is not that young, but the perception is incorrect. Another mistake, unusual comedic events, they are poorly executed. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, the plot complexity does not help to entertain the spectators. The plot is confusing, but if you spend some minutes understanding it, the outcome will be interesting to the point that you can like some twists and you can question about the Island history and existence. Additionally, all happens in a small portion of land where we can see how the persons inside believe in mythical stories involving the main characters in the present, past, and future (Setsuna and Rinne).  Sadly, some parts of the plot give the sensation that is misplaced and leaves a gap that needs to be explained. Another factor that scares a lot of the spectators is the pacing. The pacing is not that bad. In a short amount of time the series setups an interesting concept full of mystery, fables, and love. Island could have improved with a better pacing and/or more information about the story.    <br />
<br />
The characters are not that amazing, they can be generic and not too special. However, I think it is intentional because in that way you can appreciate the contrast between Setsuna and Rinne and how they are related to the island fables. In addition, the main characters tend to lose their memory so it is obvious that they are not going to have a full background. My favorite character is Kuon because at the end of the series is a character that presented an important evolution. Kuon has more personality compared with the rest.<br />
<br />
About the art and sound, the art isn&#039;t that generic. It is clean, smooth, and the colors are bright. However, the technique is incorrectly used. Since one of the main attractions of Island is the time travel, the artists couldn&#039;t find a middle point between young and old. They defined characters with a very youthful look misleading the viewers and affecting the outcome directly. It creates a wrongly pedophilic sensation with the slogan “Setsuna wants all these girls.” Maybe it was the fault of the director, but they wasted some acceptable art trying to create a failed visual contrast and a failed visual age gap between the characters. The result is inappropriate but I cannot dig the series for a mistake that comes from the Visual Novel. It is just the artist perception of the story.<br />
<br />
The sound is acceptable and helps to guide the spectator when the climax changes. The OP is great if you pay attention to the lyrics and the catching rhytm while the ED is normal. <br />
<br />
Should you watch Island? Maybe you can try the first episodes but have patience, the story is complex and you could notice some pacing and narrative issues. Honestly, the final score went up from 6.11 - 6.46 after the last two episodes. That indicates the show isn&#039;t abysmal.

    Island <br />
<br />
It&#039;s very weird... IDK... I didn&#039;t hate the show, I actually enjoyed it, but the Story made no sense, it has 192093012930192039 loose ends and I guess only the people who played the game will understand.<br />
<br />
IT MADE NO SENSE BUT HAD KAWAII GIRLS AND FUNNY CHARACTERS... so it&#039;s worth watching I guess?? maybe... IDK... <br />
<br />
AAAAAAAAA the ending made me lose my mind... idk boyz and grills BYeeeeeee<br />
<br />
Well MAL won&#039;t let me finish the review so I guess I will write a bit more lol.<br />
<br />
So here is the deal... go add me as a friend so We can talk about anime and stuff.

    A&#039;ight, here&#039;s the thing: a lot of people have been giving some pretty bad reviews about this show, and anyone who has seen it would most probably agree... Except I don&#039;t. <br />
<br />
So, before I get to the part explaining how I &quot;chose&quot; to enjoy this show, I will start by trying to &quot;spoiler-less-ly&quot; summarize the plot.<br />
<br />
[Story]<br />
You have your average looking Shujinkou (Protagonist) &quot;Setsuna&quot; who claims to have come from the future on a rescue mission. His destination is a certain island, &quot;Urashima&quot; with a rather confusing and dark past led by three distinguished families. Each family has its role and its domain on the island.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309404">
        And there&#039;s apparently a legend revolving around these families, more specifically the girls who belong to them (I&#039;ll say nothing more to avoid spoilers). Anyways, the island seems to be in a pretty bad shape, and it&#039;s only getting worse, and the key to save it is one of the three girls of the Island&#039;s top families.<br />
<br />
[Art/Animation/Sound]<br />
The technical stuff was all good, just what you&#039;d expect from a newly produced Anime. The art and the character design were nice, I&#039;m actually a big fan of long white hair female characters ( :3 ), and the design team didn&#039;t disappoint in this matter. The Anime itself didn&#039;t have that much action, to begin with, and yet the animation was pretty good as well as the sound whether it&#039;s the voice actors or background music... <br />
<br />
[Enjoyment]<br />
First of all, I must say: I&#039;m a guy who can rewatch a show as many times as humanly possible and still enjoys it pretty much the same. And I have an unspoken rule not to drop any show regardless of how much I enjoy it, and up to this day, I haven&#039;t broken this rule, yet. I still find it very hard to decide whether I enjoyed a show or not... It&#039;s a dilemma for me!<br />
Here&#039;s my take on this one:<br />
Well if you&#039;ve seen Heroic Age, Wolf Rain, Special A, Kannagi, Bounen no Xamdou, Druaga no Tou, Shikabane Hime... etc (plus any other show I rated 6 or less in my list) and still enjoyed them the way I did, you&#039;ll probably feel the same about Island as me: &quot;As long as it ends well without complications, then it&#039;s been a decent show&quot;. That being said, there were a lot of parts that are still unclear and confusing to me in the story, and there are many plot-holes; I decided to disregard them and try to just enjoy watching and digesting the story... <br />
The truth is, I felt like the whole thing was rushed, and after I read about the source material I found out that this was based off a VN and I chose to give it a 6 overall because of that (the VN), which I&#039;m pretty sure would be pretty enjoyable...<br />
<br />
P.S: I didn&#039;t write about Character development, because I honestly don&#039;t know how to talk about it. If this was handled a little more cautiously, I bet the story would&#039;ve turned out much better.<br />
But still, I&#039;m grateful for the show. Even if it lacked in so many aspects, I decided that I enjoyed it nonetheless. Hopefully, next time there the studio will do a better job than this one so that we&#039;d enjoy it more.<br />
<br />
Now I won&#039;t recommend anyone to watch this show, not the fans of the VN and definitely not the newcomers, but if you believe that you&#039;re a tolerant kind of Anime-viewer, or if you&#039;re that bored, then sure, go knock yourself out! :D

    A ****show. That&#039;s what this anime is, an utter, unrepentant, disgraceful, atrocious, obnoxious, boring ****show. I&#039;ve never given an anime such a low score before but this anime is just so bloody awful, it beggars belief.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: I have only watched the anime, I have no idea about the original source that led to this adaptation and have no interest in it. Also, TL;DR at the end.<br />
<br />
The two things that bury this anime are, by far, the story (if one could even call it that) and the characters. I won&#039;t bother writing different sections to grade each thing separately, it&#039;s pointless, so I&#039;ll just whine about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289293">
        the two worst things, ye&#039;ve been warned.<br />
<br />
The story is just atrocious. Even without knowing the original source, I can see that this needed A LOT more episodes than 12. Everything is jumbled together in such a nonsensical way that when the music ramps up for the &quot;ta-daaaaaaaaa, plot twist!&quot; moment I only felt extremely confused because I didn&#039;t know what the hell I was supposed to think. The gist of it is time travel, I guess. The amoeba and only man on the island thinks he travelled back through time to...there, I don&#039;t know. At one time I thought it was to save his daughter (that he very much felt like shagging when he didn&#039;t know she was his daughter, obviously) and at another time it felt like he needed to fix the problems that would lead to the future.<br />
BUT NO! In the end, it was only about him ******* his old love, because the time machine isn&#039;t a time machine, it&#039;s a time stopping machine, whoever goes in has their time halted while the rest of the world keeps going on, and yet the island is still THE SAME, where all things happen the same bloody way in a continuous loop. This is so bloody retarded that I feel like my lowly IQ got shot a few points down just by trying to think about it again.<br />
Story is a guy who flirts with 3 different girls, one of which his daughter, only to eventually marry his original girlfriend who of course used another time stopping machine (which conveniently awoke her a couple decades before him). That&#039;s it. It&#039;s atrociously stupid.<br />
<br />
Characters. Oh boy. The thing I noticed the most is how death is treated here. A girl finds out her mother died and will you look at that, 5 seconds later and a quick transition is enough for her to be as cheerful as she was. And it&#039;s not the &quot;oh I act cheerful but I&#039;m so sad inside&quot; kind of thing, she was LITERALLY as cheerful as before finding out her long lost mother had died.<br />
The rest of the characters are useless. Pointless. Inconsequential. There is a miko whose only reason to exist is that her...future self, great great nephew, what-the-****-ever, has huuuuge oppai while she&#039;s as flat as an ironing board. That&#039;s it. Then there&#039;s the rebellious girl who treats her mother&#039;s passing like the death of an ant and whose only purpose is to lead the protagonist to another &quot;time machine&quot;.<br />
Then the two main ones. ****able daughter Rinne and only guy in the anime, known as Setsuna. Rinne is boring. I&#039;d rather watch paint dry than having to listen to anything her character says. She has no personality, she just wants to shag Setsuna cos she feels so lonely and blahblahblah you get the point.<br />
Setsuna himself is just &quot;oh I have to help everyone and I have to save Rinne because oh I don&#039;t know, what&#039;s this feeling BLAAAAAHHHHHHHHH&quot; ffs, I can&#039;t be bothered. He&#039;s an idiot, with no traits other than the I&#039;llsaveeveryonecosI&#039;mthehero one, he&#039;s not charming, he&#039;s not funny, he&#039;s not intelligent, he&#039;s not witty, he&#039;s the human equivalent of a room painted eggshell.<br />
<br />
TL;DR I regret every single minute I spent watching this ****show. Please be smarter than me and DON&#039;T waste your precious time with this sodding disaster of an anime.

    Although visual novel is very hard to make into an anime, however, this anime is the does not even match to the original story. There is a lot of changes in the story (For example Rinne just scared of going out in day time in the original story, but in anime it becomes that she will die if the sun shine on her) and the main character is really annoying in the anime. Strongly agree to read the visual novel as the story is great. Visual novel story is complicated to understand, but it is all worth it to spend 30hr on it. Anime 3/10,

    	A naked guy on a beach with amnesia wakes up with a girl laying face down on his dick. This is the first scene of Island, a show airing this summer anime 2018 season. Labeled as a drama sci fi show, Island takes place on an island that is isolated by the rest of the world. Bound by its old traditions, the island has its own social structure, which consists of their three families basically acting as major political figures on the island. Recently, the island has been under some distress and the families are under suspicion. These odd circumstances can only be solved by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289380">
        the daughters of the three families, named Rinne Karen, and Sara, and by a mysterious man that washes up on the beach devoid of all memories. Except the fact that he is named Setsuna.<br />
<br />
	This show is quite obviously a visual novel. It has three girls, and a protagonist that looks generic as have the watcher imprint themselves on them, and a story that clearly shows all of the girl’s story options. Now me myself haven’t played or seen any gameplay of the game, but with basic visual novel tropes I can guess some things about the anime based on that. So the anime tried to adapt all of the endings and make it flow into a cohesive story. I feel as though this backfired though, because it feels suddenly split from one girl’s storyline to the next one, which made things more confusing for me. And it doesn’t help either that Sara and Karen’s story ended before the 6 or 7 episode mark. I guess in this visual novel there is a very specific girl you were meant to follow, and they tried to make the majority of the show about that. That in and of itself isn’t bad, but it feels like the other two stories were rushed. Especially with Sara’s story, where the revelation and the twist happened literally in the span of 10 minutes. It was resolved as soon as they knew what the problem was. And after both their stories were finished, they were forced to the sidelines almost immediately, now acting as side or even filler characters to react to what they protagonist and Rinne does.<br />
<br />
	Its mentioned in the synopsis that the island is cut off from the rest of the world, which suggests a more tropical, deserted island feeling. But, this isn’t the case at all, and is pretty industrialized for what it claims to be. It seems to be receiving manufactured goods, so the only way its cut off is that the families won’t let anybody enter or leave. Another issue is with the genre tags used for this show. The first half of the show doesn’t have anything to do with sci fi at all. Even some of the middle episode after that only hint at some ancient technology before we get hit all at once during the last 4 or so episodes. Before that its a slice of life drama with a piece of mystery through and through. <br />
<br />
	The characters in this show represent your basic girl tropes in anime. Karen is the blond hair tsundere who is the daughter of the family that currently runs things. Sara is a shrine girl loli that works really hard to compensate for her family that has gone off the map in terms of politics. And Rinne is the main girl which has the most backstory and development behind her. The protagonist I already touched on as being your typical anime protagonist. I can’t say the any of them are good characters. There are always leaps in logic and stuff that should have been obvious, but wasn’t. It doesn’t go far beyond in accordance to their personalities. They’re mostly carried by their stories.<br />
<br />
	Island’s story is confusing, rushed, and boring. The first 6 episodes were very very slow, almost completely ignoring the sci fi tag. And even when they did go into the mystery more, I just ended up not caring for anything they were showing me. Or in this case, telling me. Maybe if this show was more then one cour or season, they would have had the time to flesh out the stories of each character more. I feel like they stories they presented were genuinely interesting, but it was just presented in such a way to the point where it became a snooze fest full of characters I don’t care about.<br />
<br />
	The art in this show is below average. In terms of both character art as well as background art. On a tropical island, you were expect to get long shots of beautiful beaches or some pretty pictures of some of the scenery you would see. Island has that, but they don’t look good in the slightest. If the show takes place in a setting where it&#039;s supposed to be bright sunny and beautiful, I would assume you would spend more of the budget on its art. This show’s animation is also sub par. Its very stiff and it doesn’t do much extra when it comes to its “action” scenes. It&#039;s not on the lowest tier of animation I’ve seen, but it&#039;s enough to notice that something is wrong here.<br />
<br />
	Island, for me, felt like it had more to say. But its short run time made it feel like they didn’t get enough stuff into it as they would’ve liked. Anyway, the end result is a bad show all around. I recommend this to someone who wouldn’t mind waiting for a while to watch a only decent sci fi mystery. Maybe someone else can appreciate Island more than I could. I give this show a 3 out of 10. This has been PixEFit’s spoiler free, but not really anime review on Island.<br />

    The Island anime is sort of like traveling nomads. A group of people who just travel around aimlessly without a fixated habitation. The problem with this sort of skeleton is that the anime just turns into a “master of none” type of scenario. Trying to incorporate all these different plot points and different tropes and it ends up just falling flat on its ass. Island has a cool time traveling thing it has going on, but it fails to develop it properly. Having very vague rules and up until the later episodes, activating when the plot demands it. It then just info dumps on you.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289178">
        Expecting the viewer to understand or even care at that point.  It has a cast that has interesting backstories that connects back to the island, but instead of properly fleshing out its characters, it feels like a hentai. Just one-dimensional tropey characters that essentially want to bone the MC. Having an Island setting is somewhat interesting, but it has too much editing in post that makes the art look artificial and boring to look at instead of something natural. The one redeeming this is the music, but that only goes so far in your tolerance of what you can take on the BS happening in this anime.  Having all of these things would make you have an average anime. However, what makes it very much below average is that fact that it constantly disappoints the viewer on all fronts. It isn’t good at anything that it&#039;s trying to be and culminated into a massive mess that I can’t recommend to anyone. It fails at being a thriller. It fails at being an ecchi visual novel. It fails at being a compelling character story and it fails at looking good. It fails on all fronts.

    Although as you already noticed most of the reviews are very negative towards this anime I want to be more neutral.<br />
<br />
Watching &quot;Island&quot; may not be for everyone since it&#039;s story is trying to confuse you but overall I believe It&#039;s very cool &quot;mystery&quot; anime. Ever since you jump into this anime you will experience good animation and very fitting sounds. To be fair it may also make you a little uncomfortable but if you can deal with that feeling, why not try it ?<br />
<br />
Overall I would recommend this anime for everyone who has free time to spare and likes mysteries like in Hyouka :)<br />
Don&#039;t expect

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284672">
        too much but it&#039;s certainly not bad and some people may even love the story... <br />
<br />
I watched 4 episodes so I&#039;m not sure what brings us the ending so my opinion might change.

    The show is full of slice of life style writing despite being marketed as a mystery sci-fi drama. There&#039;s also a lot of fan service which sometimes leaves me giggling but other times seems too unoriginal or forced.<br />
<br />
As of 5 episodes, we&#039;re nowhere near a conclusion and every episode takes the narrative in a completely different direction, leaving me unsure on whether or not this show is going to answer the questions I had from episode one, let alone the abundance of questions that each consecutive episode creates.<br />
<br />
However, the show is still enjoyable to consume on a weekly basis since the characters aren&#039;t too insufferable

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285112">
        so if that&#039;s the kind of show you&#039;re looking for, you should at least try this show out.

    Short and quick review:<br />
<br />
Ah here we go again, every season we find ourselves in this situation where an anime so mediocre with chracters so flat and bland it makes you wonder if you are ever going to see a SOL/romance/harem VN adaptation that doesn&#039;t suck.<br />
<br />
I assure you, you have indeed watched Island before, but you just can&#039;t remember when and where, just like the MC in this anime, he just can&#039;t seem to remember how many girls he has slept with, just flashbacks. Sad indeed.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;ve watched any other mediocre trash of an anime, then rest assured that this one is no different, I&#039;ve watched

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284615">
        enough anime of this sort to safely say that this anime is not worth your time, unless you wish to see an MC which is slightly edgier than other harem anime MCs, then by all means go ahead, but you&#039;ll soon be disappointed by how generic the heroines are.<br />
<br />
Spoilers ahead: <br />
<br />
One of the female characters said &#039;Mess me up&#039; by the end of Episode 3 to the MC and I see this as doing a great disservice to an anime that is already pathetic to the point where I just ended up dropping it 4 episodes in. At this point it&#039;s basically just using fanservice as bait.<br />
<br />
A good anime or rather any good story should make the audience understand what&#039;s going on as soon as the first episode ends. Sure, you may argue that great animes as such Steins Gate had a confusing start. However, what seperates Steins Gate from this anime in particular is that while we&#039;re unravelling the mystery with our MC, we have interesting characters to indulge in and also we get a gist of what&#039;s going on by the hints scattered in each episode, thus allowing us to formulate our own reasoning as to what is going on. <br />
<br />
But with Island, you get a mystery anime that quickly turned into a SOL anime that has no obvious direction, no idea what it is doing and even the chracters just felt like it&#039;s there as bait. Even after 4 episodes the anime has not clarified a lot of things and instead spends time shrouding Rinne, the main heroine, with an added layer of mystery. At this point you will soon realize that Rinne is just set up as a bigger bait to reel the audience in for just a couple more episodes before finally deciding that this show is just not worth their time. <br />
<br />
So, do we care about Rinne? Do we care about who the MC wants to kill? Do we care about the Island?<br />
<br />
No, no and no because we won&#039;t get any questions answered by the end of this anime. You&#039;re better off treating this anime as a SOL anime.

    My experience with this anime that is... ALLEGEDLY a VN adaptation can be summarized in one word: &quot;...what?&quot;<br />
<br />
At least once, I found myself going back to the info page to make sure this was indeed the VN adaptation I was following this season, because it suffers from an issue I&#039;ve never seen before in a VN adaptation (and I&#039;ve seen plenty of subpar VN anime): every week, it felt like they were making it up as they went along. I&#039;m not sure who&#039;s at fault for this, actually; whether the anime team didn&#039;t do a proper job explaining everything or the VN itself didn&#039;t do

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289246">
        that, but either way, I, the viewer, was left scratching my head.<br />
<br />
The cause of all this confusion is that most ill-defined and whatever-they-want-it-to-be of plot devices, time travel. I recall something in the earlier episodes about one of the leads thinking they were from the past or something and one thinking they were from the future, then some side characters (who ultimately proved to be irrelevant) were given arcs lasting a couple episodes each, some of whom were convinced they were or had to become time travelers themselves, then they took away the protagonist&#039;s memory a second time or something and had him time travel again and suddenly the setting was totally different for just two episodes, and then the final episode with its final twists that feel like they thought them up in the week beforehand got even more ridiculous and I&#039;ve given up trying to follow the order of events.<br />
<br />
I was so clocked out trying to follow the plot, I had actually dropped it by episode 11. At the time, I was thinking the plot still made so little sense that they&#039;d be making something like 16 total episodes to properly resolve everything in a way that made sense. It wasn&#039;t until I found out it suddenly ended at just 12 that I decided to watch that final episode. That final episode, I can summarize the same way I&#039;d summarize this whole series: while it kind of has good character moments, I&#039;m too busy not understanding what&#039;s going on to feel anything.

    I binge watched this show twice as the first time through I missed important information about the story. I liked that it&#039;s a complete story from episode 1 through 12.  The graphics and music are beautiful and the story is heart warming.  The story keeps you guessing what&#039;s next all the way through.  There is a lot of character development in the first 5 episodes and then &quot;the plot thickens&quot;...  I loved it!  The story really makes you think...  It&#039;s worth seeing the story through as the ending is worth it. It is also a show I could share

        with my mother as I tried telling her a little bit about this story and she ended up having me watch it again with her and she loved it too! First Anime my mom ever watched and she liked it!

    This anime, seriously, it&#039;s the best. <br />
<br />
People sound like don&#039;t like it so much, but for my it&#039;s brilliant. <br />
<br />
I love how the story tells, <br />
for the first time, you probably don&#039;t get it clearly. <br />
It&#039;s can make your &quot;brain blow up&quot;, <br />
but through the story timeline, <br />
and it has lots of punch lines that will make you shocked and for part<br />
it&#039;s can make you feel some feels that I can make you understand this.<br />
<br />
For the art and character, it&#039;s for your feels, but for me, it&#039;s 10/10.<br />
<br />
For the sound, OP, and ED it&#039;s great, but there&#039;s a song or a sound that originated from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review419164">
        a Spanish song that will make you remember it&#039;s for so long.<br />
<br />
For enjoyment, it has everything to make you love it.<br />
<br />
In total, it&#039;s brilliant<br />
<br />
So believe in me, you should get right into it and also fall in love with this!
