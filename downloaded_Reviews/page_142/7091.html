    It&#039;s time for momotaro lure. nah..<br />
<br />
My problem have 3 things<br />
<br />
1. The mood changes very quickly. I understand that it changes to make people look more excited but sometimes it&#039;s fast for no reason.<br />
<br />
2. fight scene have little action<br />
<br />
3. In the beginning Story have no idea which way to go<br />
<br />
However I love when characters talk each other with fan service and madness from edgy characters at the same time. It&#039;s hard for me to pick Peach boy in each episode but when I watched it hard to drop during that time. I will follow because of Peach Boy characters and Kobayashi-san writer.

    Peach Boy riverside : the anime that decides to fling itself into the dumpster because it couldn&#039;t decide to follow the chronological order just to look edgy . but don&#039;t drop it just yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
The main problem of riverside is that it had a good story to tell but the studio decided that “it&#039;ll be cool if we just make the first episode the 4th episode ?”<br />
NO ffs , the first episode is a very convincing drop-the-show for the less tolerant people just because of how confusing it gets. You are just dropped into the middle of it and expected to just go along with the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409398">
        flow.<br />
<br />
the point is  this show is just the studio  misunderstanding their own audience and characters don&#039;t believe me ? Here is another example<br />
<br />
<br />
This show has ecchi scenes that are not even present in the original source material . YEP THAT&#039;S RIGHT  they just included it for fan service and always bring up absurd angles clearly meant for ecchi shows even during important  dialogue scenes where the facial/ emotional perspective of the character might have been more fitting than an ASS SHOT.<br />
<br />
But ,They did not even bother showing reactions of characters, for example when a certain characters (something-important) gets erased at the end of the episode the man falls to his knees and seems dejected (as he should be) ,  but by the next episode he seems out and about likes some normal happy-go-lucky-pleb xD . Now I get it that shuffling the episodes and chronological order might make sense for a mystery anime , you know , feed us tidbits to tease us and get us to buy into the mystery by trying to solve it by ourselves . but here it is just annoying and pointless since its totally enjoyable the way it should have been ie episode 4,1,2,3 and so on. but no episode 4 had to be the 4th entry for some reason.<br />
<br />
<br />
However, if you can look past all this and are patient enough and manage to watch the first three eps , you can tell that there is a story that has potential besides the initial hiccup of the first episode being a confusing mess I feel that if you give it the four episode rule maybe just maybe you could see this season of peach boy riverside all the way to the end but do not keep your hopes high.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now for the statistics , the characters seem to be straight out of hentai , the voice acting is average , plot an absolute mess , mostly confusing till episode 3  but at least interesting , art and animation looks promising (at the very least ) but they haven&#039;t had an opportunity to show it off properly yet due to most fights being one-sided so far. OP and ED depends on taste but they were very forgettable for me<br />
<br />
<br />
Also for your own sake watch it from episode 4 then ep1 , 2, 3 xD<br />

    First time writing a review so don’t tell me to go jump off a cliff if I have no clue what I’m talking about.<br />
Peach Boy Riverside is honestly wasted potential. One of the shows I was really interested in, due to my love for myths and lore’s, and sad to say but I was really let down by it. An already set up premise ruined by a horrible method of storytelling. The shows later episodes honestly made me want to drop it, due to how mind numbingly annoying the arrangement is and how shit barely makes sense.<br />
<br />
Story: (2/10)<br />
Honestly there’s nothing much to say about the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416834">
        story. It’s set in your usual fantasy world with humans and demons and big tiddy anime girls. It’s filled with clichés and often times have no idea where they want the story to go towards. The first few episodes will definitely get you interested, but the problem starts in the later half. The storytelling in this show is horrible. The episodes being scattered is honestly annoying and rly takes you off the world (worse if you’re watching weekly). The story introduces various major events and backstories out of the blue, then proceeds to not explain the outcome or the effects of thy said events. Like bruh, the last thing I want to do is brainstorm the events of 9 episodes and put them in order before watching the latest one.<br />
<br />
Characters: (5/10)<br />
Probably one of the redeeming aspects of the show. The characters aren’t the most unique or mind blowing, but they blend into the world well and honestly makes you curious to see their journey through. The most interesting character is definitely Mikoto. A feminine looking male, whom every one confuses for a girl, which is a running gag on the show. His backstory is simple yet interesting. It’s honestly amusing to see him go from being all quiet and collected, to losing his shit and getting horny over the thought of killing ogres. Sally is another character that catches your eye for two reasons, her powers and slightly less yet fiery thirst for killing ogres (similar to mikotos) and of course, those big fat buzzums, praise the lord! <br />
The 2 main characters have contradicting aims, one seeking peace between the ogres and humans, and the other seeking total annihilation of their species, and it really is fun to see how this plays out.<br />
The side characters are just there for the sake of being there, doesn’t really catch your attention or get you heavily invested in them. Fraus a walking, talking rabbit who turns into batman for a short while…oh yeah apparently he’s also dead idk. Carrots swaying between her ogre origins and human affections is executed pretty poorly. The knight guy is there…yea. Milias hyper active nature and her interactions with ogre hating mikoto is fun to see. But that’s honestly it for side characters.<br />
<br />
Art: (6/10)<br />
With the sheer abundance of isekais plaguing my eyes with the same, generic art, it’s almost refreshing to see a somewhat new and unique art style. Now it’s definitely no Monogatari or Violet Evergarden, but it’s enough to deserve a pat in the back. The animation is….alright I guess. The fair few fights there is has subpar animation, and most fights end before you can even realize what happened (or maybe I fell asleep idk). The backgrounds and surrounding gives you an olden age fantasy world vibes. The art fails in the demons aspects tho. Although the main demons have some uniqueness to them, the lesser ones look super generic, and often times comical. It fails to convince you that these are an actual threat and feels more like a villain out of power rangers. Kinda takes you away from the world, but thankfully Sally’s tiddys are there to hook you right back in.<br />
<br />
Sound: (5/10)<br />
I don’t really pay attention to sound, but the OSTs in this show are decent. It definitely helps to make u feel the olden fantasy vibes a lot more. The OPs and EDs alright, nothing spectacular.<br />
<br />
Overall: (4/10)<br />
Definitely not the worst thing to ever come out since corona, but not good enough to leave you satisfied or looking back on it fondly. The episodes were fun in its own means sure, but I felt more annoyed than pleasant after completing every episode, remembering that the previous episode and the next one has no co-relation to the one I just watched. I regret watching it weekly, I feel like I would have appreciated the show more by binging it in the proper order. It had a lot of potential to be a fairly decent fantasy show in the pile of repetitive garbage that we get nowadays. Not a show that makes me want to overdose on heroin, but definitely not one I’m going to think of when I want to watch a fantasy show in the future.<br />
<br />
Again, absolute beginner reviewer. If my words are absolute camelshit than I apologies. It’s honestly just what I felt about the show. Anyways its 5 am here, gunna stop overdosing on caffeine and go hibernate for the next 3 days. Peace!<br />

    Peach Boy Riverside speaks as much about racism as much as a 10 second video of a dancing T-Rex with &quot;RACISM IS BAD&quot;  in huge text in the background. But while Clickhole was satirizing the surface level nature of media championing anti-racism stances without meaningfully contributing to the cause , PBR thinks it&#039;s making a grand statement on race in spite of its superficiality and  comes across as shallow at best and runs outright contrary to its message at its worst.<br />
<br />
At its core, PBR is a mediocre (and I mean mediocre) action shounen where the fight scenes are poorly paced, and as competent

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416842">
        the animation is, nothing interesting. It values the characters endlessly talking and giving one-liners over proper choreography or even striking visuals. I hate making direct comparisons, but it&#039;s inevitable since it&#039;s airing just a day apart, but you know your action anime is in trouble when a cutesy Slice of Life Comedy has far, FAR better action scenes than you. I don&#039;t know who to pin the blame on, whether it&#039;s the original source material, the original original web manga, or the animators for their incompetency, but the end result is still a boring mess to behold.<br />
<br />
Speaking of its themes, the writing is just so weak. Coming directly after COOL&#039;s own Maid Dragon S, where, while simple, can deliver moments of wit and cleverness in its writing, the writing of PBR is just asinine. To support its themes of &quot;Racism is bad&quot;, they show that both the main characters and the main villains (and everyone in between) are unkind assholes at best, and unhinged psychopaths at worst. Apart from Sally and Frau and Hawthorne all taking neutral but not really stances, there is nothing that&#039;s explored on race, class, and treatment of different people, the only thing I got out of this was that the people being discriminated (the oni) are cruel assholes too. At least with Maid Dragon, COOL wisely decided to keep the anti-racism themes in the backburner if he can&#039;t meaningfully expand upon it, and the few times Maid Dragon deals with racism it&#039;s usually dealt in a more mature manner than PBR&#039;s &quot;Everyone is bad!&quot; angle.<br />
<br />
Beyond its failings to convey its themes, PBR is just dull. The story is as milquetoast as these action shounen get, with Sally or Mikoto going to different towns, meeting racist assholes and begrudgingly protecting them from racist oni (in Mikoto&#039;s case it&#039;s because he&#039;s genuinely unhinged, but even that isn&#039;t conveyed well or is played interestingly). But the problem isn&#039;t because the plot is generic, plenty of shows have a similar structure, it&#039;s because none of the characters are likeable at all. PBR does the thing where it kills off characters and expects you to have an emotional response to it, and this happens to characters you barely even get to know. Worse still, the core cast of characters are generally boring to follow since the main story never bothers to meaningfully develop them in any way. Yeah Meki goes through some things, but none of that either meaningfully changes the plot or her dynamics with the group she&#039;s in. If anything the show isn&#039;t particularly funny, nor does it evoke any emotional response from me. It&#039;s just boring, and that&#039;s a greater misstep than anything else. I can appreciate weirdo wild rides where it utterly fails to convey its themes like Guilty Crown, but I just can&#039;t sit through a boring slog like this that also fails to convey its message.<br />
<br />
The director of the show also took the baffling idea to jumble up the sequence in a misguided attempt to salvage this mess with the excuse that it&#039;s done for pacing purposes being a big fat lie since if anything it completely destroys the pacing. Not that shows that air out of order can&#039;t work, see the broadcast order of Haruhi as an example, but you gotta make sure that the show was made to be watched out of order in the first place. As such scenes that should generate tension completely fall flat on its face such as the final few episodes, or how the actual chronological final episode made the show feel like it ended abruptly and has the consequence of making episodes after that feel like even more of a slog to go through. It&#039;s just, baffling to see such a deliberate act of sabotage that it must be some kind of joke, especially since some streaming services just air the show in chronological order.<br />
<br />
I suppose the only reason I kept on watching this is for the slim chance that there&#039;s a cameo by Tohru or Elma (spoilers: there isn&#039;t). But that&#039;s quite possibly the worst reason to continue a show. At the end of each episode, I have to rewatch Maid Dragon S in order to convince myself that COOL isn&#039;t a complete hack and that he can write genuinely good material. But alas, that isn&#039;t the case with PBR. <br />
<br />
If you want an action show that&#039;s funny, deals with themes of the relations of race in a more nuanced manner, and has amazing action sequences, just watch Maid Dragon. <br />

    To call the anime adaptation of Peach Boy Riverside a mess would actually be an understatement. A “mess” is usually caused by accident, trying to do something well and then tripping for some reason or the other. No, the fate of this anime was sealed before an episode even aired.<br />
<br />
The staff decided to take a fairly logical flow of events from the manga, and then shuffle them around, just so the final episode could end on some sort of action climax. This butchers the show right out of the gate. It makes you wonder why certain characters are even in certain places at certain times

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416837">
        without properly communicating a sense of time. Occasionally Sally, one of the two protagonists, will have an outfit change, but other than that, it makes the timeline seem jumpy and difficult to really wrap your head around, especially for weekly viewers. <br />
<br />
If you’re a manga reader, this approach does very little, since you already know what happens in the story and can already say what goes where. Hell, the anime itself manages to both spoil the result of the final episode before it even happens and make the ending of another episode a huge ass pull because it brings in a character the audience hadn’t gotten to know yet. So, this is detrimental on both ends. I’ve seen some comparisons made to Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Baccano before the series aired, in regard to airing episodes out of the intended order from their source, but both of those series better justify this particular decision. Haruhi was mostly a slice of life comedy, with only some plot gradually thrown through the background, so the lack of consequence in the majority of runtime fit the kind of show that it was, while letting individual episodes stand out on their own. Baccano meanwhile was an incredibly fast paced show; many events of importance were happening at once and one of the three plotlines was an action setpiece on a train that was constantly evolving. <br />
<br />
Peach Boy Riverside doesn’t have the forethought of either series. It’s tied to a fairly strict continuity of events each episode, at a pace that can be incredibly slow at points, and there’s no distinct vibe that the out of orderness adds to spice up the viewing experience, beyond learning certain things earlier than they’ll actually come up. To any new watchers, there’s nothing to gain from the way the staff aired this anime, which I will judge as such since that’s how it was released. <br />
<br />
Jee, I’ve talked so much about the out of order timeline and its detrimental effect on enjoying the show that I’ve barely talked about the show itself yet!<br />
So, what is this story that the staff felt was so intriguing that it needed to be told out of order to try and invest a brand new audience? A painfully generic fantasy romp that makes Akame ga Kill seem inspired by comparison, even with its folktale inspiration. <br />
<br />
In a fantasy world that’s incredibly non-descript, half the show follows Sally, a princess with the magical power of getting hot and bothered. The other half follows Mikoto, a swordsman who seems dedicated to solving the systemic problems of the world by murdering nearly every oni he comes across, but not when one of them needs to be alive for plot reasons, or tag along with either protagonist for reasons that don’t add too much beyond more powers for the action scenes. The show likes to abuse the “pet the dog” trope for these characters, giving a determinably evil race just enough sympathy or a cute design for them to stick around, but not enough to really……understand them. It’s mostly a series of slow conversations underlying limp, weakly animated schlocky action. <br />
<br />
Characters talk about various things, places get destroyed, but the show doesn’t do enough to get you invested in its world. It’s a very thrown together world, the kind that’s unfortunately very common in low rent fantasy stories. Every place is just a place to host plot. If each setting the characters visited had a distinct visual identity, perhaps it would better serve the out of order pacing of the anime by making it easy for viewers to remember what place was shown when, but alas. It’s not a plot to really expect much from, but at times it’s trying to say something about racism. <br />
<br />
It’s not entirely lip service either despite not having much punch. How humans treat demihumans (or ogres) with disrespect versus how demihumans harshly react to the human characters is something that’s occasionally brought up as a drive across several episodes. This is at least pondered in Episode 7, and creates the distinct ideologies of the two protagonists.<br />
<br />
Sally…is not a great female lead for this story. Beyond the in-poor-taste tentacle fanservice you see right from Episode 1, she’s mainly there to be incredibly ignorant of the world around her as a once sheltered princess and, again, get hot and bothered during the action scenes……………………..like once. If the first episode hooked you on the possibility of her going cuckoo for Coco Puffs in the action scenes, I hate to say it but this hardly ever happens again; one action scene later when she uses the power, she’s fairly measured. Crunchyroll at least wanted to market the series with the scene where Sally goes crazy with her special shonen power, but if you want more of that craziness, it’s missing in a show that’s already committed to being hardcore schlock. Instead, she’s mostly just shown as painfully naïve. By the third episode, which takes place a bit later in the actual timeline, she’s deciding between the guy who wants to kill all the ogres, but whom she personally knows has her best interest in mind, and a total snake who claims to be wanting the races to co-exist. She’s one of the characters hurt most by the out of order pacing, participating in action but not driving a plot that’s above the audiences’ heads.<br />
<br />
Mikoto is at least a little better; there’s actually an episode in the season that shows us their crybaby backstory which is…………fine, probably one of the few episodes where its timeline placement doesn’t really damage the cruddy pacing of the series. Sometimes his attitude is enjoyable. Otherwise though, he alternates between being nonchalantly morbid and IMUSTKILLALLTHEOGRES much like a certain other Shonen protagonist known for yelling. His voice actress is very sweet sounding, to the point where, in combination with the wiki considering him “non-bindery”, I assumed maybe this character was a non-binary protagonist, which could’ve been fairly progressive for anime. But nope. Quite the opposite, we get an incredibly uncomfortable gender panic scene in Episode 4, where Sally is shocked at him being flatchested and then lands on top of him as she realizes further. Another episode literally ends on a joke of someone else realizing the character is a femboy. GREAT. <br />
<br />
The rest of the cast is pretty dull: a collection of tropes with little to really contribute. There’s witches, nuns, tiny priest looking ogre girls, a boring guy who only exists to be the straight man, and a series of ogre designs which serve more as action obstacles than anything else. With exception to Mikoto and one other, there isn’t much to really care about in the limited time the anime has; most of these relationships are shown out of order at any rate.<br />
The best character in the show is easily Frau, one of the few for whom the racism lip service idea has some kind of fruit to bear. Frau has a distinct design as a bunny schoolgirl shaped like a friend, and their loyalty to Sally is at least charming and believable in a couple of the action scenes, despite the weird worldbuilding to justify their revival mechanics not really being. Still, they’re the most distinct character in a fairly bland and boring cast.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the best I can say visually is that there’s at least……………..some creative designs? Like the aforementioned Frau, or the giant walrus and chicken demon things from the first episode. There’s some variety in even the more generic ogre characters. The art style is passable, but you won’t find much in the way of fluid animation to come from it. Most action scenes compromise of several motion tweens moved in sequence, and the occasional big explosion. It doesn’t go nearly as ridiculously bloody as you might hope from a show like this; a Kouta Hirano anime this certainly isn’t. There’s no cost cutting CGI, which is good, at least until an ugly CGI tree in the final episode. It keeps a consistent art style in place, but these scenes don’t do enough to stand out or flow well at any rate. <br />
<br />
Similar for the soundtrack; there’s a couple decent tunes drowned out by the dialogue, but nothing you’ll think of after this show ends. The ED though is one of the lamest I’ve ever seen visually in some time, with almost nothing going on but panning up on still shots of characters in various places; no unique personality of an animator shining through. <br />
<br />
Peach Boy Riverside is mostly pretty trash, but not entirely from the base of it. I at least like the idea of having two protagonists with distinct ideologies regarding their world’s systemic conflict going on their separate journeys and occasionally crossing paths, even if that happens too frequently in conjunction with lackluster worldbuilding, action scenes being schlocky without being memorable and the out of order story the anime staff planned out not being very considered for narrative investment at all. You’re not gonna get much from here. If you really care about the story that much, just read the manga. But if you’re just a shonen or action fan, I’d say skip this self-inflicted mess. There’s much better options for you out there in both a building structure and bombast from action scenes.<br />

    Before starting this review proper, you, the reader of all things, should be informed of this: watch Peach Boy Riverside in its original intended &quot;Time Series version&quot; order, NOT the &quot;On Air version&quot; order in which this absolute MF of a director &quot;purposefully/intentionally&quot; shuffled a decent but cool story that&#039;s written by the mangaka of Miss Kobayashi&#039;s Dragon Maid (Cool-kyou Shinja) to oblivion. I know I have been burnt totally by this madlad of a seriously cursed &quot;talent&quot; of a director such as Shigeru Ueda before through the horrible abomination that is Gekidol, and his directorial intention to go anachronical with Peach Boy Riverside just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416831">
        to make things &quot;more interesting&quot; is just...it makes me mad that someone like him is hired to destroy any momentum of whatever anime that translates to the volume of readership towards the original source material. Please pray tell that no anime production team will hire this director without any clear indication of a narrative path in the near future. WHEW, RANT DONE.<br />

The first of 3 Cool-kyou Shinja adaptations in this Summer 2021 season, and with that said, what is Peach Boy Riverside all about? To get the basis of such a story that this now famous author has concocted, if you&#039;ve ever been taught some Japanese History before, the story of the Momotaro is that he is a popular hero of Japanese folklore. His name translates as Peach Tarō, a common Japanese masculine name, and is often translated as Peach Boy. The Momotaro was born from a giant peach, which was found floating down a river by an old, childless woman who was washing clothes there. The woman and her husband discovered the child when they tried to open the peach to eat it. The child explained that he had been bestowed by the Gods to be their son. The couple named him Momotaro, from momo (peach) and taro (eldest son in the family). When he matured into adolescence, Momotaro left his parents to fight a band of Oni (demons or ogres) who went pillaging over their land, by seeking them out in the distant island where they dwelled (a place called Onigashima or &quot;Demon Island&quot;). En route, Momotaro met and befriended a talking dog, monkey and pheasant, who agreed to help him in his quest in exchange for a portion of his rations (kibi dango or &quot;millet dumplings&quot;). At the island, Momotarō and his animal friends penetrated the demons&#039; fort and beat the band of demons into surrendering. Momotarō and his new friends returned home with the demons&#039; plundered treasure and the demon chief as a captive.<br />
<br />
Cool-kyou Shinja&#039;s version is a bit more loose and simplified, that it only engages the mature side of things without the whole exposition of the newborn Momotaro, and that the animal companion part only consists of a talking dog. Yet though, the Momotaro lore is not lost, and to concoct a story out of that with the base foundation of a world filled with humans and demons being at loggerhands with one another, it only results in more killings between each species. Enter the unassuming lone traveller that is Mikoto Kibitsu, an established ruthless Momotaro demon slayer, and a coincidental meet with Sally (a.k.a Saltorine Aldike, the princess of the Kingdom of Aldike) on an equation to a child&#039;s runaway rebellious nature kickstarts the princess&#039;s dream of learning what lies beyond the kingdom&#039;s walls. Instead of being confined to the royal palace, to go out on her own dangerous mission like Mikoto&#039;s, and that&#039;s where her journey starts.<br />
<br />
First off, I&#039;ve gotta say that I wished that Mikoto had more screentime as he is the story foundation of a hostile demon slayer, unlike the benign Sally and the other people that she&#039;ll encounter on this journey between the humans and demons to break down the walls between both species and come to a peaceful resolution (which trust me, will never happen). Whenever we see Mikoto on screen, it&#039;s instantaneous that any demon who comes across his path will not be let loose easily, and more often times than not, result in uncouth attempts of death perceptions unfazed. Make no mistake, Mikoto in his Momotaro state is merciless while maintaining a facade of playing niceties to Sally and the other demon-converted demi-humans. Speaking of demi-humans, because of the long-running conflict between humans and demons, demi-humans (half-human, half-demon) are notoriously shunned by humans out of warranted fear. And that&#039;s the rhetoric of Sally meeting demi-humans like the carrot-loving rabbit-human Frau and former Eye Oni (a.k.a Meki) Carrot, along with Captain of the Rimdarl Knights Hawthorn Grattor on this gratifying plause of a journey. In the process, more demons show up and serve the antagonist roles against those who defy their order, and when these two sides clash, it&#039;s a brutal battle to claim superiority and discernment. Sally herself is an interesting character in which from the get-go, meeting Mikoto is like her dream come true to explore the world solo, only to be met with such atrocities, forcing her to become a Momotaro in the process, like it or not. Otherwise, I&#039;d also mention that since the web manga of this was published years before Miss Kobayashi&#039;s Dragon Maid (and the remake version published after said series), you can really tell that there is a clear distinction between the characters illustrated in both series.<br />
<br />
With that said, when it comes to the production side of things, I&#039;ve never had faith of Asahi Production shows that could pull any genre off with the usual limited budget works that this studio always seems to undertake. And knowing director Shigeru Ueda&#039;s nonsensical direction of all things, Peach Boy Riverside just seems...there. With almost blurring the line for action production values that are teetering on the line of &quot;just nice&quot; and nothing more, I can only say that as underwhelming as the manga can be at times, at least the anime traded that off with some average tropes like the constant fanservice shots (which I don&#039;t remember seeing them at all), since Peach Boy Riverside isn&#039;t as fanservice-y as Dragon Maid, and there&#039;s gotta be a give of a fair trade, right? The OST, just like the production values are just servicable enough, there&#039;s nothing of give that I can say that it&#039;s good, but it&#039;s decent and easily forgettable when you&#039;re done with the show.<br />
<br />
When all is said and done, the TL;DR is this: please refer to the forum thread that I made that clears this entire nonsense, and as spoilery as that can be, that is the only way to enjoy Peach Boy Riverside at its best for the majority that wants a watch (or a re-watch) of this. I know that some minorities will prefer the shuffled order, but this is not how you execute a Haruhi Suzumiya nor Princess Principal-type case of an analogy where everyone has the love-hate relationship with anachronistic orders. And the director is the only one that thought that it&#039;d be a good idea to do a complete 180 UNO Reverse card at the behest of everyone else in the production team, with or without Cool-kyou Shinja&#039;s supervision. A self-entitled bad call and horrible directional take to ruin a source material, I feel sad for the mangaka. Watch at your own risk for Peach Boy Riverside in whatever order that you so choose, but if there&#039;s anything of hope, I&#039;d say that the story of the Momotaro is indeed a fascinating one to have, that&#039;s sadly not created nor talked about much in the AniManga space.

    I feel sorry for Peach Boy, and for anyone who was really looking forward to this. While it&#039;s never a bad show by any stretch, the story is there, the characters seem fun, and the art style is colourful, and can be dark when it wants to be. The main issue, is how the first couple of episodes are laid out, and that is what hurts the show the most. Imagine as if you&#039;ve got a good story to tell, but you can&#039;t wait to tell this or that part of the story, so you either rush through it, or just jump to certain points.If

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409406">
        you didn&#039;t know about the whole episode weirdness, you&#039;d be left confused for a moment, and wondering why we are suddenly at point H when we were only on point E the previous week.<br />
<br />
While the show can certainly be very enjoyable, but it&#039;s that kind of set up tat really hurts it. I&#039;m sure, if it came out in order, it may, or may not have a better rating then it has currently. But that remains to be seen. As for how the story is in general? Let me see....<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story is pretty simple. A fantasy world where most humans hate and dislike these demi humans that are also in this world, even if some are good people. As we follow Saltorine, a princess who traded her comfy life, for something more thrilling of adventure. She got this, She got inspiried by a boy named Mikoto, whom slayed these beasts. Now, she craves, and is on her own adventure. Running into a demi human in Frau, as they travel together on their own quest. To not only find the guy again, but in terms of the princess, &#039;to rid her boredom&#039; <br />
<br />
The story also offers a strange twist, that does make you curious. Both Mikoto, and Sally gain these peach eyes for different reasons, and makes their personality a bit more yandere like. A bit insane. But it also seems to make them fearless, and pushes their abilities up more. Which does bring a much needed interest factor to the show.<br />
<br />
Not to mention Frau kicks ass too. She&#039;s precious.<br />
<br />
As for their personalities? There is a lot to like about them, Sally is kind and caring, and would save anyone. Human, or demi human. A good girl, despite er craving for more overpowering her. Mikoto has a good head on his shoulders, but like Sally, has a few of his screws loose too. Which only adds more. While Frau....Honestly, just give Frau as many carrots as she wants. She&#039;s a cute rabbit girl that you&#039;ll just love.<br />
<br />
Art and sound:<br />
I&#039;ve already mentioned about the art style earlier, so I don&#039;t really need to go into too much detail here, as it&#039;s a good style, and can look light and good wen it wants to be, but also the same way for more darker scenes. Much like the music and sounds throughout the show are not only fit for purpose, but are good to make an enjoyable anime.<br />
<br />
If it wasn&#039;t for how this was ordered. Peachy boy get a bit more love and support, but due to the episodes being a bit over the place, it hurts the show. Even if that, I do recommend you start watching it, as it can be still decent, even if it&#039;s weirdly placed like this. So give it a shot! But if not, your best bet is to wait until it&#039;s finished, and watch it in it&#039;s proper story order.

    Peach Boy Riverside is not so bad animation when you watch it in different order.<br />
I suggest to line up episodes as 4, 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 11, 12, 5, 6, 8, 10.<br />
If you watch it like this it&#039;s rating could be quite good. <br />
<br />
Story in right order is quite normal adventure one. 7 points<br />
I do like the adventure part of the story but it&#039;s not anything very new.<br />
<br />
Art is nice, about 9 points. <br />
The scenery and monsters and everything are made with great care.<br />
<br />
Sound is good, 9 points. <br />
Someone have done a good work with sound, that makes it more and more understandably why

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416848">
        the episodes are such a mess. <br />
<br />
Character development is actually interesting. Especially I like Carrot and Frau, Sally is little bit too immature. 8 points.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 7 points. <br />
<br />
That means overall 8 points.

    Spoiler Free Review:<br />
First time writing a review so it might be abit messy. Can&#039;t believe my first review is about this god awful anime.<br />
<br />
Story: 3/10<br />
There is no plot whatsoever. They&#039;re overpowered just because, there&#039;s nothing to explain where they&#039;re getting the power from. The scenes drag out for so long that honestly I&#039;d rather watch paint dry. The beginning was not bad it just got worse the more you watched it. It&#039;s also edgy for the sake of being edgy. Honestly I&#039;m just watching it for the sake of finishing it. <br />
<br />
Characters: 3/10<br />
The main character just makes me cringe, her personality is so basic a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414128">
        typical mc the type that &quot;wants to save everyone even my enemies&quot; its like season 2 Emma from tpn. Ofcourse she has plot armor they all do. Nobody dies even when they do they get revived because they&#039;re the main character.. The mc&#039;s dont have character development. If you&#039;ve watched anime a lot you can already predict what will happen next, it feels like a 3 year old wrote the characters backstories.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
As an artist myself I found the artstyle quiet nice. It wasn&#039;t very unique but it wasn&#039;t bad, honestly the only reason why I gave this anime a chance.<br />
<br />
Overall/Enjoyment: 5/10<br />
I did not enjoy the story, the animation and art is what made it good. If you&#039;re looking for a good plot I HIGHLY discourage watching this awful show, but if you&#039;re looking for something more pleasing to the eye then this is a good show.<br />
<br />

    I advise you just read the manga, the anime (I don&#039;t know if its the TV broadcast in JP or the Director trying to be &quot;Unique&quot;) has the worst watch order ever. The 4th episode is the 1st, the 7th episode is the continuation of episode 2 and I don&#039;t get this mess. Overall the story is interesting so if your are trying to get into Peach Boy Riverside I advise you just read the manga  or if you hate reading try watching it in chronology order when it&#039;s finished.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is being aired out of chronological order from the original source material by decision

          <span style="display: none;" id="review412555">
        of the studio. Episodes 1-2 actually track fine, but 3 is just jarring and will make you feel like you missed a ton of info (which you did). Might be worthwhile to check when complete to see if you can watch in a true chronological order, but for now this decision just baffles me and I see no reason to watch it.<br />
<br />
For reference on where I got the info on the re-ordered airing - https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2021-07-01/peach-boy-riverside-anime-airing-out-of-chronological-order/.174683

    This is like really bad medieval fantasy hodgepodge fanfiction mixed with scatterbrained hamfisted indulgences of phony social justice mixed with inconsistent and very poorly developed utterly random characters with contrived backgrounds mixed with some of the most vacuous melodrama in an utterly disjointed and confused set of disparate events. At this point I&#039;m waiting for a UFO piloted by a sumo wrestler to come down and obliterate all of human kind, only for the characters to scream the aliens are being racist for not also killing off the fake-demihuman rabbit angel thing, who happens to be immortal and this whole anime is just a harebrained

        dream it is having. All ludicrous and meaningless. Somehow it feels like an AI wrote this utter BS, throwing a whole bunch of hashtags into a mixing bowl.

    Peach Boy Riverside. A manga written by the same author as Dragon Maid which is now being adapted to the hottest garbage I&#039;ve seen in a while. And I absolutely adore it. As someone who has watched and loved most of Cool-kyou Shinja&#039;s work (that were adapted into anime), I came into this anime expecting exactly what I got from Dragon Maid, dumb fun and cute girls. And. It. Delivered. I could not be happier. As every anime fan knows, there will always be some anime you see that you know is terrible but you can&#039;t help but enjoy. This is one of mine. It&#039;s

    To summarize this anime, it&#039;s an anime like Garden of Sinners but take out anything that makes Garden of Sinners good. First of all, who thought that it would be a good idea to shuffle the episodes randomly for a non-mystery anime. bruh<br />
<br />
welp, Moving on to my actual review. The story is quite bad. Wait, it&#039;s not bad. It had some genuine good moments and decent writing, but what makes it bad is the unnecessarily shuffling of the episodes. That makes the pacing really bad because for example, you&#039;re reaching the climax of a scene in one episode, then to the next episode, you get

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416844">
        blue-balled because the episode had nothing to do with the previous ones. And that&#039;s making it really frustrating to watch through. I envy those who waited for this anime to finish because they can binge this easily IN THE CORRECT ORDER.<br />
<br />
The characters are... not bad. They lacked development and personality, but they have some cool moments sprinkled throughout the story. It&#039;s just that those moments might or might now be underwhelming. It&#039;s the former for me. <br />
<br />
The animation is decent for the most part, but it has some awkward still images and unimaginative animation sequences. Just don&#039;t expect anything mind-blowing from the animation because it&#039;s even compatible to the year 2010&#039;s tbh.<br />
<br />
The music is good. It had some nice ost and some decent opening and ending themes. Nothing much else to say.<br />
<br />
Overall, I didn&#039;t really enjoyed my time watching this anime. After the 2nd or 3rd episode where I noticed that the order of the release was shuffled, I jumped straight to the manga. And that was probably the best thing that came out from me watching this anime.

    Peach Boy Riverside......Now this is an anime that stands out from all the other animes this season. But sadly not for the right reason. <br />
<br />
*spoilers*<br />
This anime started off rather strong with our generic mc meeting hare folk who is passed out on the side of street. Our mc helps the harefolk and one things leads to another and our faces are filled with very interesting concepts including inequality and a sense of corruption. But after that its all down hill from there. We are then shown with what are meant to be antagonist but a futile attempt of where no one is actually evil buts

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416828">
        its all to do with perspective. This fails miserably as none of the characters are in anyway memorable.<br />
<br />
But even with all this I still enjoyed the story. But then they add an extremely confusing concept that through me off entirely and even had me wondering if I had missed episodes. But no...it turns out they decided to make the anime out of order which doesn&#039;t follow the manga in the slightest which ruined the series for me.<br />
<br />
Characters 5<br />
The character and per say bad by any means but they don&#039;t have anything that makes them entirely memorable or leaves an impact. The main girl is rather boring and can sometimes be annoying with her personality being way too positive. Her counter part mikoto who I really enjoyed at the start left me slightly disappointed in the end because he was a very generic &quot;I need revenge character&quot;. Everybody else was fine but nothing too crazy.<br />
<br />
Animation 7<br />
The animation was fairly decent to say the least. It wasn&#039;t anything spectacular but if got the job done nicely. There wasn&#039;t any chi that I can recall throughout the series that was very nice.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 6<br />
Even after everything I still enjoyed the series even with all its flaws. The fights were interesting and had me entertained, but I just didn&#039;t really care for the characters and I feel like there was a lot that wasn&#039;t explained as it should have. *cough* *cough* frau.<br />
<br />
Overall 6<br />
 it was aight but I was expecting better ngl<br />

    This show is an utter failure. I saw the trailer when it first dropped out and can&#039;t lie, I was looking forward to it. But what I got was a weird, incoherence Show that&#039;s trying so hard to give fan service yet hook you into the story. They drop you in the middle of the episode excepting you to go along with the flow. And while I did continue with it it was only out of my pure boredom and me slacking from my assignments.<br />
Finally, I have no connection whatsoever with any of the characters that we meet so far nor do I truly care

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414455">
        about the story as it has a very weak almost non-existence plot. The animation is the only good thing about this show, but it has no point when everything else is bad. I will finish it only for the sake of adding it to my watched list, nothing more. But I honestly don&#039;t recommend it unless you have nothing better to do with your life and want to escape your assignments.

    This things first. The whole story, art, soundstage and characters are good enough to keep you into this show so if you want to watch it then give it a try at least, but here comes the bummer (and oh boy is this a huge one).<br />
<br />
This Order of publishing episodes ruins the whole anime for me and that&#039;s a shame. I feel that this show has nice character building with sometimes more behind the door than you think at first glimpse, but damn this publishing order is ruining everything it&#039;s wants to try building up with every episode.. tension, sympathy for the main characters, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410523">
        interest or maybe even concerns about the story is going straight up into the bin with every new episode that is beeing published, because even if you have cliffhanger at the end you know at that exact moment that this is not how the journey continues next week. I mean you do not rearrange Frederic Chopins Ballade No 1. in G Minor as well just because it&#039;s cool i guess? When you still have the dedication to do it you have to do it right and that one here isn&#039;t one of these cases. Otherwise it just sounds bad.. really bad and the same is going on with this anime. It could be much better but it isn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
All in all no good. With every episode you end up getting nowhere, because the story suffers from a huge lack of exposition due to the fact that with every new episode you watch from this anime the first thing you are going to ask yourself is: &quot;why is this happening? Where is this character coming from? Wait did I miss something oh yeah probably...&quot; and the problem is.. nobody is going to telll you either. You don&#039;t understand what&#039;s happening? Well than that&#039;s your problem and that should not be the case.<br />
<br />
This Anime could be much better but whoever made the decision to rearrange the publishing order did a real disservice to the anime itself.<br />
<br />
TL;DR <br />
watch this anime in the &quot;Time series version&quot; where everything is happening in the correct chronological order and you are having a good time this one.<br />

    Before I begin, I&#039;ll mention the obligatory episode airdate fiasco. Yeah don&#039;t watch this in the order it&#039;s been streamed, some director decided to go full &quot;avant garde&quot; and mix up the airdate of the episodes. I think absolutely everyone who watched it in this incorrect airdate agreed it made the story worse. It is 100% necessary to watch this in the correct episode order in order to actually enjoy this show.<br />
<br />
So this will be made in an attempt to review the series as if this incident had not occurred. Keep in mind I have not seen the series in this order, so there will

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416889">
        be a bit of negative bias to this review as a result of the poor airdate that you as the reader may want to keep in mind. <br />
<br />
NOW TO BEGIN<br />
Peach Boy Riverside follows the separate adventures of Sally and Mikoto as they both wander the kingdom fighting Ogres, their paths sometimes intersecting. Ogres are strange beasts that come in many forms with only one similarity they all kill humans. <br />
This show has a strong thematic message through the two leads - Sally represents the desire to coexist with the Ogres, while Mikoto represents the human hatred against the Ogres. Sally gathers companions to herself while Mikoto isolates himself from others. <br />
The problem here is that the thematic elements are incredibly ham-fisted and lack the subtlety and nuance of real life systemic issues. Characters spend long conversations talking about the divide between Ogres and Humans, but never seem to be able to say anything profound. Anything of value. Anything that someone with a pair of eyes and a working brain couldn&#039;t have figured out for themselves. And that&#039;s the problem here. The show is too immature to tackle such a complex issue, but since it does so anyway, it weighs down the experience from what would otherwise have been a violent and cool action fantasy show. <br />
<br />
And this immaturity permeates through every aspect of the show. The characters are incredibly bland. I would go so far to say that none of them really have any complex characteristics and personalities. Sally&#039;s &#039;party&#039; is composed of a series of bland caricatures. You&#039;ve got the pure-hearted knight Hawthorn, the mute humanoid bunny Frau, and Carrot the obnoxious goth girl with divided allegiance. None of these characters feel realistic or tangible, but if you&#039;re a lover of anime tropes, then this&#039;ll be your bread and butter. <br />
<br />
The animation is very average. Just like with most other action-heavy shows with a low budget, there&#039;s a lot of standing around during fight scenes and awkward posing to attempt to cut costs. Don&#039;t watch this show for the animation, it&#039;s not worth it. The character designs are fine I guess. I am honestly concerned with the amount of bust all the female characters have to carry around in this show. It&#039;s one of those &#039;anime logic&#039; moments where all the warrior women have gargantuan breasts despite that being completely impractical. There&#039;s also a lot of violence. When people are stabbed/sliced or hurt in any way blood goes flying in ridiculous fashion. That said despite the seinen origins of the manga, there&#039;s absolutely nothing mature about how the show handles this violence. There&#039;s no real abuse or torture. The show doesn&#039;t do anything particularly dark. It&#039;s the kind of violence that would please only an edgy 13 year old or a haemophiliac.<br />
<br />
The music is pretty much composed of stock isekai fantasy music and a bit of electric guitar. I found the opening and endings pretty average. In all there&#039;s nothing particularly unique about the sound of this show.<br />
<br />
TL;DR Peach Boy Riverside can be considered an edgy shounen or an immature seinen. Either way it&#039;s not particularly unique or interesting. Racism in anime has been handled better before, and the characters aren&#039;t interesting enough to compensate for this lack. I wouldn&#039;t really recommend this show to anyone. I guess edgy 13-14 year olds will get a kick out of the ultraviolence and busty women, but if you&#039;re looking for literally anything more look elsewhere.

    I&#039;m going to give this a higher score in this review than I will in my list. My reason for that is the fact that the main issue that this show faces is something that can be avoided now that the show has finished airing. But what is that issue?<br />
<br />
They adapted the manga out of order. To be clear, that isn&#039;t an issue in and of itself. There are some reasons why that choice could have been a good one: maybe it could have helped build mystery, or maybe it would have helped with world-building in some way. But the issue here is the fact

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416865">
        that this isn&#039;t a mystery show, and there is no actual reason to do this. All this did was create confusion for the sake of being confusing. Instead of being able to just enjoy the show, we have to re-orient ourselves every few episodes and wonder, are we continuing the arc, are we in the past, or are we in the future? This is annoying, and completely makes me lose interest in what&#039;s going on, which is a shame, because I really enjoyed the first couple of episodes.<br />
<br />
But with all that said, now that the show has finished airing, you can watch the episodes in chronological order, and remove this issue. So should you do that? Although I don&#039;t necessarily think the show is anything special, I do think it definitely has things to like about it.<br />
<br />
The story revolves around the conflicts between humans, demihumans, and ogres, and the conflicts that exist between them. Demihumans are completely discriminated against, while ogres aren&#039;t exactly the kindest towards humans. Our main character, Sally, starts off on a quest to find a certain someone, and along the way, also ends up seeing these conflicts up close, and decides that things shouldn&#039;t be that way. She wants everyone to be able to co-exist, a view which can be seen as very naive, and which may somewhat contradict the special power she seems to get when she needs to fight. The journey, along with the different people that are involved in it who each have their own views and worries make for a pretty interesting world that&#039;s worth exploring, if the premise sounds interesting to you. I will say again, the series isn&#039;t really anything special, but it should still be a decent time, as long as you watch the episodes in chronological order (which you can definitely look up and find somewhere).

    Gosh I was actually hoping to watch a nice fantasy setting ogre vs human type of anime. But no human use swords that can&#039;t hurt ogres, ogres in turn have super power the likes of dragonball or something of that sort, where a single ogre can level an entire city to ground castle walls houses everything. Then there is this hunters that have nothing special except the ability to kill ogres and are immune to the powers. As such there is practically no fight scenes cause it&#039;s a one sided massacre!!! If that&#039;s the kind of anime that&#039;s up your alley then this could be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review412457">
        your cup of tea. Oh and to top it all up, the anime also decide to skip events here and there and then comes back to where it left of after a few episodes later, just for the sack of making viewers confuse. Perhaps if you really want to watch it wait for the full release then perhaps you won&#039;t get so dizzy from the events.

    the plot of the anime will make you think that it is a decent product with nothing fantastic or terrible, &quot;laugh&quot;, but it is not. The first episode was also worthy to be called a decent work but from the second episode down it seems to fall off a precipice (I dropped it in episode 3 so it could also be wrong as a review, it contains spoilers). In the second episode the battle against two monsters begins but immediately it becomes clear that their stupidity is equal to a giant hen present in the anime. Monsters are divided into two types which we will

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411403">
        call A and B. A would be for monsters with an intellect equal to 20 IQ and which mainly follow instinct such as the chicken mentioned above. The B, on the other hand, would be moderately intelligent monsters where in some cases they follow the instinct others the reason. Returning to the previous discussion, 2 monsters B attack the city. A laser shoots from the eye that consumes so much energy and therefore turns into a loli, yes a loli ... why does she turn into a loli? Because she consumed too much energy ... so are you telling me that when you use a lot of energy you turn into a little girl !? Instead the other monster B goes into the city to make a mess and there he meets the main characters and what does he do? He attacks him as one might deduce but why doesn&#039;t he realize he has another monster B against him? Let&#039;s ignore for the moment the fact that he&#039;s up against his fellow man, but don&#039;t wonder why he doesn&#039;t notice a monster equal to or superior to the enemy in front of him (I mean the MC)? I don&#039;t think the MC is able to contain the power it releases or can&#039;t you see the aura that emanates? Then in episode three I see a scene that pisses me off by cursing the MC and company. Earlier I talked about loli, apparently she wrestled a boy and lost by passing out. A sane person would have killed Monster B instantly but apparently the MC doesn&#039;t want to, why? because it is not right to make a person die, &quot;clap your hands&quot;. This anime shows us how stupid people are and their twisted logic, the story i gave 2/10, sound 3/10, character 4/10, enjoyment 2/10, art is the only decent thing and i given 7/10, overall I gave a lower rating which is 2/10. As you understand it is an anime that I do not recommend even to fans of fantasy with MC op.
