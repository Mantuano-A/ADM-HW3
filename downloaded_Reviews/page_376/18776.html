    TLDR; Behold, indeed, this series is proof of abominable abomination.<br />
<br />
Otome Dori is just downright nasty, a perfect example of how ugly one imagination can be, purely by creating this wicked story just to please their sick fantasies. It’s such a shame to see how low our brothers in arms have fallen, that they beat us up to this.<br />
<br />
The story is so badly written to the point that I want to gouge my eyes out. Its stupidity is on a whole new level than Nobita, that even Doraemon can’t do a thing. Its potential story is just wasted, like Mayflies, who live only for 24 hours.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251116">
        There is no real development that pushes the story forward to make it better. Instead, it just went into a downward spiral into a misery hole. Not to mention, those unholy rapists combo with the almighty scaredy-cat mc who barely takes action to defend his girls. He isn&#039;t an alpha, less than beta, and not even a simp. It can be said that this series is already a lost cause. But hey, the series still deserves some praise for sending you into a depression state and pissing you off non-stop instead. It is so amazingly done that I pray for God himself to come down and embrace my soul so I can spit out this poopy series from heaven. No, no, and no. There is just nothing good about this one.<br />
<br />
The sound of this series is like someone who is reaching orgasm before meeting death. What a fine piece of pleasure. To be nutted is still nutted. Bluntly, I think the sound is what helps the series to reach the top-notch of atrocious. It&#039;s so unbelievably good that you know your granny just can&#039;t help but smirk at your fresh Nutella!<br />
<br />
The animation is godly class, but amiss in the wrong series. Honestly, it is purely erotic, where you can get into heat in a matter of seconds. Yet it still failed miserably to cover the hideous story behind it. I probably could have enjoyed it more. I wish I could, but I just can&#039;t. As a fellow human, I can say this series is one of those, where it becomes the lowest of low. Goosh goosh, Hell would spit it out too. Who wants to feel so freaking depressed anyway?<br />
<br />
I’m simply disgusted by the characters. The main characters are just plain idiots. Perhaps their idiotic level is probably the highest level ever recorded in humanity that thwarts realistically common sense out of the black hole. Our unholy rapist; is just much worse. Practically speaking, there is no other role for them besides rape and combo with their hideous beyond saving appearance, I just can&#039;t help but scream as loud as I can. Just what kind of creature is this?! YA MY GOAT, YAAA WHERE IS MY HOLY WATER WHEN I NEED IT?!<br />
<br />
In the end, I have to say, my cat&#039;s poops are amazingly better. It still stinks, but hey, at least it is not as bad as this one. Wasting both my time and brain, simply to process this somewhat questionable ‘story’. I don&#039;t want to be rude, but mate, I think it&#039;s better to set some boundaries or limits if you want to live a healthy lifestyle in general, yeah?<br />
<br />
Extras POV :<br />
All puns and rants aside, I liked the romance side of the series. The settings and its premise, in the beginning, feel so unbelievably real and good, to the point where we can find ourselves rooting for the main character for once. It&#039;s rarer since it&#039;s hentai for all we know. The characters are also nicely drawn. Otome, in particular, is so dazzling as a waifu material. That thick-ass body is truly a wonder to the eyes. Heck, I&#039;d smack Rinka&#039;s ass as well. But honestly, let us just stop here. This one is a no-go. It isn&#039;t worth it to be nutted with depressing mental health. I had been there once and it was hell, literally HELL. I know it&#039;s good to fap, but mates, please love and cherish yourself more. We all deserve better.

    A famous philosopher once said “It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up magazine”. Looking back to his 1994 work, one would never think that hentai would take it this far. Well, it did. Otome Dori plays into the popular “It was all a dream” approach and it comes off as a deep and philosophical story about an unfortunate young man who happens to get videos in the mail which depict his childhood friend being violated by fat old men. Something so cruel couldn&#039;t be true, right? Well folks, it gets worse.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s get this out of the way, it is not intended

          <span style="display: none;" id="review74643">
        for all audiences. Some of the weaker willed people cannot handle a NTR story, especially one with the additional lewd plot points in which this one has. It is unfortunate due to the fact that they are missing out on one of the best examples of the genre. Regardless of their whining, the story takes a typical NTR scenario and twists it into something special. It is a story of betrayal, jealousy, and pure unadulterated rage. Carn&#039;s complex story makes the viewer question themselves on what is actually the truth and what is actually fake. We see it through the hapless main character who is thrown into a sticky situation where he gets a mysterious DVD in the mail. After opening it up and viewing the contents, he realizes it&#039;s his childhood friend and love interest is being violated by faceless old men. As the story progresses and the DVDs become more and more graphic one begins to think that it&#039;s too cruel to be true. Follow it up with the main character questioning his own sanity and the cruelty of the acts, one gets the idea that there is something more behind the scenes which they need to decipher themselves. Luckily, the unexpected mastermind behind this unfortunate story reveals herself and her true goals which works its way to the thrilling conclusion in which the viewers question the reality of what they had seen prior. It is an incredible way to play with your mind and I must say that the complexity and depth of this story is unparalleled for the genre.<br />
<br />
Sadly, there are some disappointing aspects of the Otome Dori adaption as well. Sadly, some scenes in the second episode were cut short and others from the original h-manga were omitted. This knocks it down slightly due to the fact that it was not a complete adaption and the viewer does not get the same experience that the manga reader does. While the scenes were not completely relevant to the plot, they did add to the despair and overall theme of the story. Another issue is the varying quality of the art. The first episode had relatively high quality art while the second one had multiple scenes with off model quality art which is a strange clash compared to the much more higher quality that you had previously scene. While hentai is not known for its consistency and quality work, it is still nonetheless a valid criticism. However, the pros definitely outweigh the cons in the story overall.<br />
<br />
Otome Dori truly does make you question what in your life is real and what is not. Who knows, one day you might be woken up by who&#039;s presumably your child and your wife who&#039;s expecting your second after a long nightmare. Or maybe that&#039;s just another dream? Who knows what is reality and who to trust? Do you trust the Maury show or do you trust your own beliefs. Otome Dori takes the aspect of your inner nightmares and puts them into a story that can happen to anyone. They say dreams are a reflection of your inner most desires. Let&#039;s just hope that you don&#039;t have such a twisted mind that enjoys such agony and maybe you wont be as unfortunate as our main character in this story. I leave you with a word of caution when fantasizing about things because in the end they might come true.

    Otome Dori is netorare, and I understand that not everyone likes netorare. It&#039;s a bit of a paradox, you see, it hurts the heart but pleases the loins. Stirs it up or makes it wet, depending on your gender. In case you didn&#039;t know, netorare (NTR) is a genre of hentai that gives you pleasure by having the girl stolen from the guy through sexual means. It differs from cheating in the sense that women in NTR put carnal pleasure over romantic affection, whereas women who cheat do so because of the thrill.<br />
<br />
In Otome Dori, it is the same. Guy and girl have some romantic

          <span style="display: none;" id="review193802">
        attraction, then girl gets stolen away from the guy, and you see the guy go into despair. For a bit, since the series only has two episodes. He then gets a little relief, only for it to be crushed by something more sinister.<br />
<br />
Netorare works such as these almost always follow the same format. It is what defines netorare, so the variation comes from the sidelines. In this case, two close friends with a one-year age gap is quite common, and as such nothing is special about it. For that, the story gets 6.<br />
<br />
Now we go to the art section and it only boils down to one thing for me: was the art good enough to arouse me? The answer is yes, and no. While there are some parts that look good, in my opinion these parts are offset by some of the animations looking rushed. I am not an art major, so I cannot say if others have the same opinion as me, but Otome (the female lead) looks good. And with that I give the art a score of 6 as well.<br />
<br />
Sound... there&#039;s nothing noteworthy in Otome Dori except perhaps the Ending Song. It is mesmerizing. The moans, screams, orgasm sounds, sexy time music, sound effects, they seem normal to me. Kind of mediocre, actually, because I can&#039;t remember them. I should rate this a 4 or 5 but the Ending Song scores a point so I think I want to score this a 6. But no, I should be unbiased. I shall therefore give the sound a 5. If you asked me to rate the Ending Song alone, it would be 8.<br />
<br />
Onto the character section, this part almost always get downplayed by the NTR genre. You see, for it to work you must either have: a) a weak girl; or b) a guy who does not believe the girl. The most common solution to prevent a netorare situation is simply for the girl to report the incident to the proper authorities. You might say, what if the authorities are in it? I say you&#039;d have a higher chance of finding a wallet with cash inside than finding out that the authorities are going to screw you... literally or figuratively. Besides, corrupt cops would have better sources of income (taxpayer money included) unless we are talking about a slave syndicate. It would be normal to assume that in some countries (that I cannot mention else I wake up with cement shoes and be thrown into a lake) but most NTR titles occur in Japan and their police seem to have a good track record but I have noticed that I managed to go off-track, so back to the character analysis.<br />
<br />
Women in the NTR genre are purposefully made weak. A strong woman would make it fail. Therefore there is no mentionable difference between the woman in Otome Dori and the women in other NTR titles.<br />
<br />
Most men in NTR are just as weak and Otome Dori is not an exception. Mind you, there are exceptions in the NTR genre.<br />
<br />
As such the character section gets 6 as well.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment is an automatic 8 for me because I like NTR. Those who hate NTR need to remember that this is the only section they can freely manipulate with bias. I&#039;m talking to you who rated this 1. Get your head out of your ass.<br />
<br />
Averaging all the sections EXCEPT ENJOYMENT I get 5.75, rounded up to 6.<br />
<br />
To summarize: Otome Dori is not suited for everyone, but even to the audience it caters to it is quite average. Ordinary. There is an enjoyment factor, mind you, but as far as technical aspects go, it is average.<br />
<br />
Why did I not include enjoyment in my averages? Because it&#039;s biased. Just like some people who do not know how to write a MAL review. Don&#039;t review things if you cannot assume a neutral view. The &quot;Enjoyment&quot; rating exists for a reason. Abuse it as you wish, give it a -79,361,285 rating, I could not care less.<br />

    Well what can I say, it&#039;s a Hentai Review.<br />
<br />
EP- 1<br />
<br />
Otome is the childhood friend of Kazuki who befriended her when he found her crying near a fountain , We get a brief montage of them interacting in years until we arrive at the High school years, where we get a brief moment of Kazuki and Otome having the typical Childhood friends devolving feelings for eachother.<br />
<br />
We cut too a moment where kazuki and Otome along with Kazuke&#039;s younger sister are sitting in the shade of a tree talking about their futures and Kazuke admits he wants to be with Otome for the rest of his life

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182062">
        ,much to his little sister jealousy. (subtle hint..) and we get a few moments of them getting close and imagining lewd thoughts of them together.<br />
<br />
it all changes though when Kazuke is out shopping and briefly see&#039;s Otome being fondled by an old man and led away but kazuke shrugs it off as him seeing things.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kazuke then begins to receive DVD&#039;s from an unknown person, he makes a horrifying discovery that it&#039;s porn, porn of Otome being a sex slave for 4 horny middle aged men.<br />
<br />
There is no explanation of why it happens and why Otome stays with them doing it we only get a hint at her having something promised in return for her to be used as a sex toy to the four men. even though she seems to not like it when her Virginity is taken by the first man when she wanted it to be with Kazuke.<br />
<br />
this crushes Kazuke mentally and we end episode one with Otome welcoming him home only to receive the cold shoulder from Kazuke.<br />
<br />
EP-2<br />
<br />
We cut to 10 minuets of Otome in a assortment of sex positions,moves and fetishes. much to the delight of the old men when she admits to loving it and  liking the idea of being a slut. Kazuke finally breaks down after Otome is asked if she still cares for Kazuke in which she doesn&#039;t even care for his exsistance.<br />
<br />
Kazuke snaps and goes wondering off  in a mental broken state, we then cut to Kazuke&#039;s sister Rinka who is in a Diner with an older man which then is revealed as her setting it up for &quot;PERSONAL&quot; reasons, the old man whispers to her that they should go to a secret place too f*ck, Kazuke see&#039;s his Sister enter a public Bathroom and loses his mind at the sight and sounds.<br />
<br />
Kazuke is hit in the head by one of the middle aged men and awakes to being raped by his sister who confesses that she set it up and it&#039;s all apprantley Kazukes fault for wanting to marry  Otome and not his Sister.<br />
she reveals that she was the one in Otome&#039;s current situation before and was being raped for years. she then cries out she wants her brothers baby.<br />
<br />
(the typical Incest cliche)<br />
<br />
Kazuke realizes this is what has to happen and spends the night in a hot sex rampage with his little sister.<br />
<br />
But does he??<br />
<br />
we cut to a middle aged Kazuke waking up in a horrible sweat  to then have a girl run in who looks like Otome and it&#039;s revealed to be just a horrible nightmare and that he married Otome and had a daughter with her.<br />
<br />
when Otome and his Daughter leave for a day trip ,Kazuke wonders back to his bed only to find one of the DVD&#039;s from his &quot;Dream&quot; and we end our two  Part Hentai with him hiding the DVD and wanting his current situation to be reality and not another dream.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is probably the worst attempt at a Story in Hentai because it just doesn&#039;t make sense.<br />
<br />
- Is what happend in most of the episodes a dream is his current situation a dream or what?? the series needed to pick one or the other.<br />
<br />
- if his Sister was being raped non stop why did she then agree to have sex with the older man after??<br />
<br />
- finally if all she wanted to do was screw her brother and make him hers , why did she go through such an elaborate scheme and not simply rape her brother at the start??<br />
<br />
<br />
In the end though I was never here for the story as it was sickening and left me feeling a bit bad for watching it. Otome&#039;s Scenes are pretty nice purely because of her facial expressions and the moves and positions she&#039;&#039;s put through.<br />
<br />
I avoided Rinka&#039;s scenes and eventually cut down the video too Otome&#039;s scenes.<br />
<br />
don&#039;t bother with this Hentai Series it&#039;s pretty creepy and mean spirited , Otome is the only thing  that keeps this from getting an overall 1 score.

    **WARNING, NOT ONLY DOES THIS POST CONTAIN SPOILERS, BUT IT ALSO CONTAINS AN EXTREMELY POWERFUL ANIME. THE ANIME IN QUESTION INVOLVES HENTAI AND NETORARE, WATCH AT YOUR OWN RISK**<br />
<br />
Holy shit.<br />
 The reason I am writing this is because this particular anime was rather... powerful.<br />
Now, I watched Otome Dori a few months ago after finding it through the source of a particular image. The anime seemed intriguing so I thought I&#039;d watch it. That was easily one of the worst mistakes I have ever made. Let me tell you, this is the first anime I have ever watched that has seriously gotten me depressed. Other anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review353643">
        will leave me sad for a bit when I finish it, usually due to the fact that it either doesn&#039;t have a second/third season or the characters/plot will be missed. This anime, however, left me full-on depressed for around a week. I do not get depressed easily. Hell, you&#039;d know that I rarely show true emotion. But this anime managed to not only made me admit that I have depressed, but it also change my personality quite a bit. I started thinking more about other people&#039;s emotions and, more specifically, people&#039;s relationships.<br />
I am going to make a brief summary of this anime to give you a good idea of why it had such a huge effect on me.<br />
OK, so we start off with the main characters Okino (boy), Rinka (girl) and Sakuragi/Otome (girl). Okino and Otome are really good childhood friends, and Rinka is Okino&#039;s sister. Alright, let&#039;s get down to the nitty gritty. I&#039;m going to be explaining this with no pauses, let&#039;s go.<br />
OK, so Okino likes Otome and Otome (supposedly) likes Okino, Rinka, strangely, likes Okino but Okino denies her due to the fact that she&#039;s his sister. Rinka hears Okino and Otome joking about how they&#039;d get married later in life, and this idea didn&#039;t sound very good to Rinka, as she loved Okino. One day ater school, Okino sees Otome being fondled by a strange old man. He attempts to walk up to her and ask whats going on, but after a big surge of people, Otome and the strange man are gone. Okino waves it off as no big deal and goes back home. The following week, Okino receives a letter in the mail containing a video. He puts the video in his computer and is mortified to see footage of Otome being fondled and raped by a group of pedophiles. Week-after-week Okino recieves these videos and Otome starts to like the sex more and more. Through this process, Okino gets more and more depressed. In one video, Otome is asked whether or not she still loves Okino and the cold-hearted fucking slut replies &quot;Who? Oh, that loser. No, I never loved him.&quot; At this, Okino (and myself) lose it. He follows his sister one day late at night as she sneaks out of the house. He follows her to a restaurant where she meets a strange man, the same man that was raping Otome in the videos. His sister gets handed another video tape and they walk out together to a bathroom. Okino, who is behind the bathroom, listens to what they are doing. Obviously, Rinka and the pedophile are fucking. Okino then gets hit on the head by one of the pedophiles and blacks out. He wakes up, strapped to a bed only to find none other than Rinka riding him. Disgusted, he tries to free himself but it proves futile. Rinka then goes on to explain that originally, she was being raped by the pedophiles. Rinka then goes on to explain that she had had enough with the pedophiles and so she swapped her place with Otome. She swapped with Otome because she figured that if Okino got the videos in which Otome was being raped, he wouldn&#039;t love her anymore. Rinka then says that he now has nothing and that he may as well fuck her, and Okino proceeds to do so. He wakes up and he is in a strange bed. Otome and a daughter walk into the room. Okino finds that he is grown up, as well as Otome. Otome and the kid explain that they are going out shopping. After leaving the house OKino decides to get up and sees a disk down the side of a cabinet. He puts the disk in the computer and sees Otome, pregnant, being fucked by the pedophiles. He takes the disk and puts it in his back pocket, as he hears the door being unlocked. Otome and the daughter come in and in narration, you hear Okino say &quot;I hope this is just a dream, too.&quot; and the anime ends.<br />
I hope you can understand why I&#039;m so FUCKING PISSED AT THIS GOD DAMN ANIME I WANTED TO FUCKING KILL MYSELF WHEN I FINISHED WATCHING IT HOLY SHIT. DO NOT WATCH THIS GOD-FORSAKEN ANIME BUT IF YOU WANNA WATCH IT THEN  I HOPE YOU WILL ALSO FEEL THE SAME AFTER WATCHING THIS ANIME GOD DAMN IT. <br />
HOLY DICK***

    before I started Review I wanted to say my first hentai anime was NTR anime at that time I got impressed by how anime can make me cum after watching NTR anime for some time I got bored and I found Vanilla hentai since then I became die hard Vanilla fan.. <br />
<br />
Okay moving on I first found this anime was 2014 but I did not watch this since I know how it&#039;s gonna end NTR anime has same story same ending, so I did not watch this. I recently watch Shikoku no Shaga series which was quite amazing I say specially the episode 2 after

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330715">
        I watch that I did some search and found out that Otome Dori is made by the same production staff that made Shikoku no Shaga series . then this peak my curiosity .I also watch the other series that same production house made specially. <br />
<br />
1) Baku Ane 1 &amp; 2,<br />
2) Rance 1,2,3 &amp; 4 <br />
3) Ero Semi: Ecchi ni Yaruki ni ,<br />
4) Koikishi Purely☆Kiss<br />
5) Sei Yariman Gakuen Enkou Nikki <br />
6) Wagaya no Liliana-san ( most recently release one in 2020 )<br />
<br />
<br />
Before moving alone I would like to explain what exactly NTR means <br />
<br />
Netorare is basically stealing someone else partner through rape and blackmail just like Otome dori I wanted make another point clear is this not always mean that Main male lead lover get steal sometimes female lead lover which means main male lead get stolen from her of course the partner is also a girl (may also be a gay guy ) <br />
<br />
Netori means female lead is the one doing the cheating because her husband or lover can&#039;t satisfy or always not in the home to satisfy her since she look for other ways . best thing about this is there is no rape involved <br />
<br />
Netorase means husband aka male lead knows he can&#039;t satisfy his lover so he ask someone him know to have with which ultimately leads to main male lead confessing to his lover about it and well happy ever after . there is no rape in the netorase . <br />
................................................................................................................<br />
<br />
okay after I explain this here the review of the Otome dori anime Bear it mind apart from Otome-nee  other characters pretty much garbage to me specially mc. I only enjoyed Otome-nee character and sex scenes and skipped the story I mean mc whining was annoying af .<br />
<br />
Story (1/10) basically shit even as netorare story don&#039;t have ending where mc left alone without even able to marry or even talk his lover which in here he suddenly marry her . well also story have lots of plot holes even as hentai I can&#039;t seems to ignore them . most problem that I have is mc sister did all those fucked up thing and still could not get to married with her beloved brother which makes no sense at all . and the last parts like freaking matrix kind of thing to me .  there are tons but I&#039;m not even complaining main male lead since netorare genre always like that since in the beginning. <br />
<br />
..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................<br />
<br />
Art ( 9/10) great I really love the Otome design her character design was so good even after 8 years it&#039;s still good . Otome-nee moaning face climax face all were good specially her body also sex scenes of the Otome-nee is amazing this was the main reason I watch the 2 episodes although I skip the story .  well for other characters I meant the mc&#039;s sister I&#039;m not into flat cheast girl so (0/10). well I was entirely gave focus on to the otome-nee so I did not find any other eye catching details.    <br />
<br />
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................<br />
<br />
sound (9/10) Asakawa, Yuu did amazing job at voicing otome-nee  one of the another main reason to watch the anime . <br />
<br />
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................<br />
<br />
characters well I will give individual rank for characters-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Otome-nee (10/10) One of the main reason if not only reason I watch the 2 episodes . I read Shindo L Metamorphosis  I didn&#039;t feel any sympathy for the main character which is girl but in Otome dori  I really felt sorry for the Otome-nee in first episode but in second episode first 10 minutes when Otome-nee start enjoying it I start to enjoying it  too.. well weirdly I had this feeling Since this is fictional I would not mind killing all those rapist and also mc and his fucking sister and , after that marrying Otome-nee and thoroughly stratifying her.<br />
<br />
mc(0/10) well like I said in the beginning main character always will be wimpy  he won&#039;t change after seeing all those fucking things it&#039;s carbon copy of netorare genre if author try to break it and make mc killing those rapist it would seems as taboo for others specially in Japan <br />
<br />
mc&#039;s sister ( ?/10) I seriously can&#039;t seems to rate her since the things she said to the main character contradicts the thing she done . she seriously has some screw loose even as yanadere obsessed brocon she does not fulfill her role which makes no sense .<br />
..............................................................................................................<br />
<br />
Enjoyment ( 9/10) this mark is mainly for second episode and  for the first episode  it&#039;s did hurts me a lot when Otome-nee got raped 😭 but I like scene where she wear gym cloths and had sex. well I got to say second episode was really good for me it would have been great if the author did not give not screen time for the sister and dumb fucking mc I really skip the entire sister and mc sex scenes .<br />
<br />
................................................................................................................<br />
<br />
Overall Otome-nee (9/10) her sex scenes was absolutely fantastic !   I  wish make entire second  episode only focus on her enjoying it like in first 10 minutes of episode 2.<br />
<br />
she was the only reason I watch the series apart from her I pretty much skip the story and also the mc&#039;s sister sex scenes. I didn&#039;t give two shits about main male lead and his fucked up sister also alien rapist are creepy af  <br />
<br />
<br />
PS:- for the  fellow Vanilla fans (I&#039;m also die hard Vanila fan)  don&#039;t think too much about the story line since netorare  don&#039;t have ending happy ending and never will so if you encounter netorare tag and you have weak heart don&#039;t watch it just move along.

    &quot;Twisted life, Anger,Hatred, and Madness that i have in my Feelings&quot;<br />
<br />
&#039;First don&#039;t watch this kind of hentai, it&#039;s just you are so love to watch hentai but don&#039;t know the story this hentai makes your heart broken while watching and m*********ng it will ruin your life and you will regret why are you watching this kind of hentai while doing your private that will make your heart broken.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like if this happen to your life and you don&#039;t know all the truth and you will know after how many years, it makes you regret forever. Like me while i watched the first episode it was boring

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204082">
        until you watch the end of episode 2 you will regret that why did you watched this hentai and makes your heart broken.<br />
You will think if this happen to your life and what you will do, that&#039;s why don&#039;t watch hentai that&#039;s don&#039;t know the story.<br />
<br />
Episode 1: 5/10<br />
<br />
&quot;The Main Character in love to his childhood friend until he get some mysterious DVD and watch it but while watching that DVD his heart broke when he saw his crush or likely his childhood friend bang others old men and other young man. That&#039;s why don&#039;t watch this kind of hentai<br />
<br />
Episode 2: 1/10<br />
<br />
&quot;You will notice his younger sister that&#039;s he always protecting her might commit a greater sins if this happens to you, it makes your speechless that who im trying to protect...and the last scenes are mostly that your mind will be blank that the Main character married to his childhood friend but when he watched the DVD, he thought it was just a dream but in the end he REGRET everything and that who might own that child.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#039;t be so trusted and seek the history of your close 1 before it might too late&quot;

    I hate netorare... not only because it opens old wounds but also because of circumstances like this film shows...<br />
I hate when scumbag wins in the end and there was no justice for the girl... if they were justice i did not mind at all but...<br />
<br />
Story is about childhood friends who would have their first night together and continue as lovers.<br />
But the jealousy of a little sister with a huge brother complex comes up with a plot to break them apart in the most gruesome way... and she succeeded.<br />
Out of jealousy and revenge the little sister trapped the pink haired girl in a sex trap and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247649">
        made her become a sexual slave to old men so she can have the MC to herself.<br />
However, the little sister was once raped and a slave to these men herself so she also uses the pink haired girl as a scapegoat.<br />
<br />
The sister is a hypocrite... because she says she loves the MC but also goes around fucking the old guys and other people.<br />
<br />
In the end, everyone ended up messed up in the head and crazy.<br />
Sister ended in s shrink house.<br />
Pink haired girl ended a broken sex addict and continued to record herself getting banged by the men and gave those videos to the Mc because she found arousing that he knows she cheats and gets gang banged.<br />
Mc ends up broken minded and a man who gets aroused by watching his lover get fked by other men to masturbate to it.<br />
<br />
This story made me cry in anger, because I thought of the real life victims out there and how unfair Japan treats women.<br />
Also because it opened old wounds.<br />
It made me sad how the pink haired girl got broken down by a com plot of revenge.<br />
But it also angers me how easily the pink haired girl went with all this, even if she said she loved the MC!<br />
It makes me angry how easily she got broken minded and submit and not fought against hard enough.<br />
But what angers me the most is that there was no justice. If there was justice then i would not had minded but there was none and the pink haired girl continue on and on years after.<br />
Everything was a plot of revenge by an obsessive brother complex sister who was extremely jealous and did it so she could fuck her brother and have him... but ended up insane in the end by the brother&#039;s rejects...<br />
But i call bullshit because the sister herself was a whore. She said she loved the brother but also fucked the old guys...<br />
Also, she was the first victim to these guys and she used the pink haired girl as a scapegoat as well so she killed 2 birds with one stone.<br />
<br />
I believe that by the end, the pink haired girl became insane. And even if she married the MC and made everything look like a dream... [b]she herself[/b] continued doing the videos because perhaps after discovering that he watched those videos and jerked to them, she got aroused by knowing her husband masturbates when seen her getting banged by other men.<br />
And the Mc also went insane, thought it was all a dream until he saw that last CD... and ended up being a man who gets turned on by watching his lover getting fucked by other people.<br />
Funny, there are man around the world with this fetish... cheating fetish... they get sexually aroused when seing their lovers getting banged by other men and viceversa.<br />
<br />
So, neither of the kids are his... and he knows about it... and he is forced to take care of them.<br />
The pink haired girl married him out of convenience and to cover her acts so she is just using him as a piggy bank and don&#039;t love him at all.<br />
Because she is a sex addict... she loves sex and will go to who ever gives it best. And will never know what true love is again.<br />
I believe the sister ended up in a shrink house. This I just heard I did not bother reading the manga.<br />
God, I hate when scumbags win and there is no justice.<br />
But even if she was rescued from that nightmare, her mind was already broken and she would never have a normal life again (Unless she seeks professional help, something Japan lacks because they view psychologist/psychiatrist as taboo. A true Japanese person holds it within and endures.)<br />
<br />
My only wish.. is that the kids get spared... but knowing these type of hentai... and author... they will not.<br />
<br />
I am going to say that I hate NTR with passion... because i was a victim of real life NTR and this opens old wounds... but I am a critic...<br />
I didn&#039;t think this film was going to be this bad... this is the second anime that introduced me with netorare.<br />
I got angry, so much angry the first time i saw this.<br />
I had to repeat to my self &quot;is not real is just entertainment&quot; many times over.<br />
But i could not convince myself... [b]because these things do happen fr real[/b]<br />
Not only the thing about a girl cheating on her lover behind his back but mostly that innocent women get trapped by a plot and enslaved as sex slaves, and/or whores with broken minds, in japan and around the world.<br />
This film, and another one were the ones to jump started me to read articles about rape and sexual harassment in Japan and how they are handled... [b]and it is true![/b]<br />
These things [b]DOES[/b] happen and the thing is that Japanese people doesn&#039;t care, they are cold hearted and let it happen.<br />
Hell not even the police cares! Everyone blames the victim and says that she did something to deserve it.<br />
Japan is a society of shame you see, and women prefer to let themselves be raped before calling for help and expose themselves to the public that they were victim of. because it will ruin their reputation for the rest of their lives. Society will shove them aside and give cold shoulder and will be viewed as worthless humans. The police will public humiliate them and blame the victim of the incident as if it was their fault.<br />
They are also forced to shut up and blackmailed that &quot;If you say anything, your reputation and the company/family/people you know &#039;s reputation also tarnish.&quot;<br />
So they can&#039;t just speak up. Because Japanese people have a phobia of embarrassment.<br />
<br />
Women who fall victim to this have 3 options:<br />
1) Commit suicide to escape the torment.<br />
2) Become whores and/or prostitutes because they feel worthless and have no other choice for their future.<br />
3) Become sex slaves to anyone, specially the perpetrator. Get their mind broken and submit, most become sex addicts and never learn what true love is since they only love sex and will go to who ever gives it best. <br />
And some of them just go crazy.<br />
This is why you see women shutting up while being groped on trains. They are forced to stay quiet because if they complain the police scold them for disturbing harmony and people will frown and scold them and blame them for it, say that she did something to deserve it.<br />
Old people are worst... they can get away with almost anything while blaming it on old age. They can harass young women and if the women complains and protest, people will scold them and tell them &quot;He is a senile old man, he doesn&#039;t know better.&quot;<br />
So why fight it off if there will be no help?<br />
I just could not believe how women just let themselves lead this way until i researched on it... Japan is a machist society and women has no say on the matter.<br />
(Luckily, last night i read reports that some women are actually raising a campaign to stop groping and/or sexual harassment of women.)

    so i sat down, had a cup of coffee in hand, looked at my to watch list, thought to myself: &#039;hey, imma watch some hentai&#039; so i scrolled through my list and found this, Otomi Dori.<br />
so i went to good old googles and found me a copy to watch, stuck on my headphones and got into it.<br />
It was cute and it built up the storyline quite well in the start, just another take on the childhood friend trope but then it went to shit in record time.<br />
The story became distorted beyond all recognition and i could only speculate at how this was even considered to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review216745">
        be a good idea, the characters were easily hated and did nothing to redeem your trust.<br />
<br />
By the end of the first episode i really couldn&#039;t fathom why i should watch the second episode, but i trudged on, and i really wish i didn&#039;t...<br />
It went from bad to worse, they didn&#039;t attempt to progress the story much and most of the hentai scenes were just remakes of the first episodes hentai scenes and on top of that the main character is just a lifeless blob of a bitch about the whole situation he is thrown into.<br />
<br />
nearing the end of the second episode any hopes of redemption i had were crushed by the terrible ending it had leaving me wishing i never bothered watching the abomination known as Otomi Dori.<br />
<br />
In short, should you watch this (even if its for a quick fap) ....<br />
<br />
No... just no

    Every hentai enthusiast that loves good art should watch this series. The sex scenes and animation is 11/10! Even if you don&#039;t like young girl with older men sex, it still tantalizes the senses =03. I LOVE NTR, and this series is steeped in it. If NTR is a detrimental factor, I&#039;d subtract an extra point off of my score, but still worth a watch for the animation alone.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s not much to the story... I mean, its a hentai. If you&#039;re watching it for character development, you&#039;ll be disappointed. And again, its NTR, so that&#039;s about as much as you should expect for this series.<br />
<br />
For

          <span style="display: none;" id="review232564">
        a vanilla version of the same style of animation, Nudist Beach(no not Kill la Kill Nudist Beach =02)  would be a perfect recommendation.

    Hellooo, Lewdqueen here. <br />
<br />
<br />
So, this hentai is something where you have to seperate the lewdness and storyline. Let me start with the lewdness.<br />
<br />
Alright, so the lewdness in the hentai is imo, above average. This hentai is a particular favorite of mine due to the simple fact that the animation is very smooth. I love animations where the characters look rather &quot;silky&quot; I guess as you call it. The character design for the main female is very good, the other characters look well, about average. When a female can totally lose her sanity and become absolutely filthy, you feel like you can get more into it.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review267305">
        So for a masturbation factor, this hentai should be a very good fap. The character development from normal to filthy, the animation, sound and overall it is good for just satisfying your needs, and I&#039;ll admit it, I enjoyed it a lot. Overall, I&#039;d rate this about an 8.3ish. <br />
<br />
Now, onto the actual story line and character development. The story line was rather interesting because it went into the concept of &quot;Is this a dream?&quot; Growing up I can recall that they&#039;d prefer us not to use that type of storyline because it makes you question what is real vs what is not real. Well, this hentai did exactly that. It makes you second guess all of the characters in the show and when you thought you really had a good intuition about a characters personality, it was most likely the complete opposite. I won&#039;t spoil too much, but if you want something that is a bit different than the average hentai, this one is a good one to watch. <br />
<br />
As for character development, as I said earlier, the characters went from normal to insanely lewd. Which imo, is fantastic because you see the real side of people that many are scared to venture off too. I do think however, the storyline was a bit sad imo, because *spoiler* you feel the MC&#039;s ego just fade away because he&#039;s watching the girl he loved and his sister be defiled and treated like objects and he cannot do a thing because at the same time, these females love it. This show is a show that eliminates morals on every aspect. <br />
<br />
So, if you want a hentai that is very well animated, dark morally, and is very lewd, I would suggest this one. If you want something that will satisfy you with a good storyline and a happy ending, do not watch it because this is a hentai that is not all sunshine and rainbows. <br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;d give it about a 7 or 8 with everything put together, I personally like hentais more like this, if you&#039;re kind of demented in the head such as myself.

    First off, I&#039;m going to tell a little story of how I got into watching this hentai. One day, I suddenly missed the feeling of being sad and depressed, I don&#039;t know why lol, I just did. And as far as I know, netorare hentai is usually guaranteed to make you depressed. So, I asked around the internet which is the most depressing netorare hentai and this particular anime is often said to be very depressing. So I started watching this with the intention of getting depressed.<br />
<br />
So, did I find what I&#039;ve been looking for and got depressed? Unfortunately (fortunately?) no. But, did I at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review248847">
        least enjoy the story? Definitely.<br />
<br />
Firstly, the story. The story is your typical some guy&#039;s love interest had sex with dirty old men and ended up getting addicted to dicks. But there is an interesting little backstory on how things ended up like that, so it adds a bit to the story but not that much. I&#039;m also kind of confused of the story, I mean why did they do Kazuki really dirty? He didn&#039;t do anything bad, in fact he&#039;s a good boy. <br />
<br />
The art. Can&#039;t say much about the art. I think it&#039;s pretty good.<br />
<br />
The sound. What I liked about the sound is not the music, but the voices of the characters. The highlight is definitely the old men&#039;s voices. For me, the voices perfectly captures the character of a rapist and pretty much a super perverted asshole. You know, sleazy and annoying. I can see how this might annoy some watchers. <br />
<br />
The characters. I didn&#039;t really cared much about the characters, because their personalities are pretty much predictable. Kazuki is just some pussy ass ni🅱️🅱️a who couldn&#039;t do shit for Otome and Otome is a fucking thot. The old men though, are interesting. Not in personalities but their designs. They look like aliens, one guy is a goblin lookin ass and there&#039;s this fatty who is just fucking disturbing to look at let alone looking at him fucking (no hate against fat people though). And there&#039;s also this guy who is capable of bending his penis, lol.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment. Did I enjoy the hentai? I guess so. I can see how this makes someone very depressed until they cry. I kind of felt bad for Kazuki but also angry at the same time. In fact, watching this left me more angry than depressed. I mean come on Kazuki, move the fuck on, you&#039;ll never have Otome, in fact she&#039;s a bitch and deserves to burn in hell for doing this to you my nigga. And as for his sister Rinka, I&#039;m just confused how she ended up with these old men and I didn&#039;t really cared much about her.<br />
<br />
Overall I give this an 8. I don&#039;t watch netorare much but hey, if an NTR is capable of making grown men cry then it&#039;s definitely some great (bad?) NTR. I would have given this a 9 if this succedded in making me cry but no, it didn&#039;t

    Otome Dori (2012)<br />
<br />
It is trying to be a nightmare fuel but just fails to be anything other than below average. For a show commonly mentioned in social media comments as a trick for people to watch it really doesn&#039;t do anything. It tries to give a real story behind the actions of the show but that falls apart pretty quickly. In the end, it is just an NTR show that is pretty mild in its total being with the usual extremely weak-minded guy as the protagonist. People wouldn&#039;t act like that for real so it is silly in terms of how silly the guy is.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395935">
        <br />
<br />
The art isn&#039;t a bad standard since it is good for 2012 and doesn&#039;t overdo anything excessively like the girl&#039;s bodies etc. <br />
<br />
The sound is pretty standard too. The moan of a million movies used in this as you can imagine. <br />
<br />
The characters are just generally weak. The guy is unrealistic and an idiot. Otome is equally the same and the sister is the most real but is still in a weird world of no one talks to each other. <br />
<br />
I can say it is a pretty solid 3. Nothing too bad but nothing great.

    I stubbled upon this because I was looking for something to get off to. Saw it in google gifs and thought it looked interesting.<br />
<br />
Long Story short, I didn&#039;t get off, but I was fascinated as it is my first NTR fully watched through. It left me wanting a 3rd episode to resolve a few questions that I shouldn&#039;t have been asking because I shouldn&#039;t have been watching for plot. But in my opinion for netorare to work the story is somewhat needed.<br />
<br />
The story is rather generic, not bad, but basic love triangle gone wrong. Since there are only 3 characters really (shout out to the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407100">
        mom in ep. 2 for even appearing) you know exactly what is going down within the first 7 minutes.<br />
<br />
The ending makes me feel some type of way, which is why characters are rated low. The MC is pathetic. Point blank. Even in NTR standards. But it is eye rolling to see how they frame the love interest as a terrible person and no consequences happen to the sister. There was no payoff for the characters. The MC never attempts to help his love interest, just living in denial, when she is the one being raped. <br />
<br />
I can forgive this as it is how this genre has to be to make it really work. However, with the sister disappearing near the end and having no consequences but is rewarded with what she wanted, it bring up way to many questions that leave me unable to watch it as just a run of the mill hentai. And the ending is just heartbreaking.... happy ending...?<br />
<br />
The art is pretty good for the most part. Easily fappable. There are a few times you can tell it is rushed with weird anatomy. The old men and rapist were not grotesque and some of them even looked young *gasp!* So that was pleasant to look at  if you are only in it for the sex scenes. The symbolic imagery is actually very dreamy, something I didn&#039;t expect, and a nice break from time to time.<br />
<br />
Sound is actually pretty solid. I like more realistic presentations of sex noises and this was great, no extreme yelling, overly girly voices, etc. It sounds like real sounds from real sex. Love it. The ending theme was actually pretty great, the mix of moans and other noises really was a cherry on top.<br />
<br />
Overall I was interested. It was enjoyable to watch since it was short and a solid dive into NTR, some consider this extreme, eh I wouldn&#039;t go that far but it very far from vanilla. Be prepared if dipping your toes in this, you will come out horny and sad.<br />
<br />
Enjoy<br />

    This anime is like your old, grouchy, possibly racist grandpa. He&#039;s very depressing to watch, and he doesn&#039;t tell always tell you the you what you want to hear, but he does tell you what you NEED to hear. <br />
<br />
The MC is the male protag of an NTR series, so needless to say, he&#039;s a little bitch. Even after seeing his childhood friend/potential gf get her holes drilled by a bunch of old men, he still doesn&#039;t confess to her. Because he convinces himself that it will all be all right. That in the end he will end up with her because &quot;true love will

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332325">
        always prevail&quot;. However, in this series it never does, because he never takes action to make it happen.<br />
<br />
So many modern day rom-coms have MC&#039;s that never take action, because they&#039;re too shy/scared/awkward, and yet they still end up with the girl. But this series says &quot;no, FUCK YOU, unless you take charge and make the move on the you love, than you will likely end up sad and alone&quot;, and we could all learn from that.<br />
<br />
This all circles back to our old racist grandpa. He may be an asshole, and he may deliver everything he says with a mountain of salt. But we could all learn a thing or two from him, and this, is one of those things.

    On the surface Otome Dori is a fairly easy to notice with it&#039;s cutesy character design, romantic conflict and moe elements, but it&#039;s even harder to forget when you start to look beyond and deeper into it&#039;s content: Rape and how by not doing anything through words or action are still contributing the suffering. I&#039;&#039;ll mostly talk about the themes within this hentai.<br />
<br />
While these rapes are videotaped the protagonist does little to prevent or talk to anyone instead he opts for shameful and silently viewing these tapes for his enjoyment. Otome Dori goes further and even acknowledges his role in this as well, how his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321556">
        weak and egocentric mind didn&#039;t help anyone - not even himself whom by the end seems to be the most affected. Not the most adjusted, or how you view the different characters by the end.<br />
<br />
Like the well known manga Methamorphosis (2017) Otome Dori takes the same unusual road with titializing the viewer with erotica and follows swiftly with brutal emotional content about rape and abuse. In the case of Otome Dori it suggest quite plainly that the protagonist is compliant in Rape Culture, as he does nothing but for his own benefit while knowing what&#039;s happening. By watching the tapes for weeks on end  and never confronting the problem. This is even verbally mentioned by one of the characters in episode 2, so it&#039;s clearly intentional. As I try not to spoil, I there&#039;s even a deeper and more conflicting issues hiding behind these events: Jealousy -  but that&#039;s certainly spoilers so I&#039;ll try not to add too much. Regardless Otome Dori is a interesting example of  male privilage getting aware of it&#039;s problematic content and by using the lense of erotica to expose it. <br />
<br />
Reccomended. <br />
<br />
<br />
As this is based on  already existing media it feels a bit disjointed, but regardless an adaptation should stand on it&#039;s own. <br />

    i was randomising on hanime when i saw this and I though it looks alright. I made the biggest mistake I had ever mad by clicking on this and pressing play while. I usually do a mandatory NTR proof check on all before but I didn&#039;t and I will regret that decision for the rest of my life. It started off looking ok and I wasn&#039;t to bothered about the sister waking the brother up part bc that&#039;s just the standard but as things progressed i thought that the main couple of the mc and otome looked good together and was exited to see where

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415166">
        this would go. i then wished i had never even been born in the first place. Why was it ntr. Why was it ntr.<br />
 Why was it ntr.<br />
 Why was it ntr.<br />
 Why was it ntr.<br />
 Why was it ntr.<br />
 Why was it ntr.<br />
Why was it ntr.<br />
 Why was it ntr.<br />
 Why was it ntr.<br />
thats what i found myself thinking. i saw in the comments on Hanime that it is like NTR and rape gets the best animation and character design which is so true. i wished that this story was different as i found that it had potential to be a sweet romance between otome and mc. its just a real shame that things always turn out how you least expect or want and i just want to ask god why he allowed this monstrosity to be made.<br />
have a good day and do not watch unless you want to be crying <br />

    Story 7~8<br />
Otome Dori is base on the Kazuki having a crush on Otome (his childhood friend). the hentai start describing the relation between Kazuki, Otome and Rinka (Kazuki sister).<br />
I really liked the start of the hentai as a kinda of Shoujo introducing character and setting up the story.<br />
<br />
After the main character start one day getting this dvd with his childhood friend having X sessions with a groups of men. we can starting looking at him how he is loosing his mind every week till Vol. 10. the end of the episode 1 was really a great touch about how disappointed he was about Otome. But

          <span style="display: none;" id="review235314">
        honestly Kazuki for me is at fault he didn&#039;t did anything to prevent that, not even try.<br />
<br />
Episode 2 i was totally in love with the hentai how Rinka was the master mind behind everything how the setup and the backstory was accurate to make it happen. I loved her Yandere/Tsundere Face when she told her brother the true.<br />
<br />
The Dialogues. <br />
The Dialogues were good not exaggerating with to much lines like in most of the hentai&#039;s this days. but i had to say in the episode 2 when she was wearing the school suit. the dialogues didn&#039;t match the Voices and the animation.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment i really enjoy watching this hentai is been long time since actually a plot in them.<br />
<br />
Sound.<br />
the ending of the episode 1 was really suited. <br />
<br />
Character.<br />
i hated Kazuki at end of episode 2 because he didn&#039;t have the &quot;balls&quot; to confront his wife to tell him the true.
