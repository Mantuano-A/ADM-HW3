    When I started watching this show I couldn´t help noticing how much similarities between this series and, the hugely popular, Elfen Lied existed. Both were a story about girls that were trapped in an investigation facility, that ended up escaping and then they find a really nice guy who ended up helping them, because, you know, he is THAT nice.<br />
I really wasn´t much of a fan of Elfen Lied but I gave this show an opportunity anyway, and for the first couple of episodes it wasn´t that much of a disappointment. Of course, while I was watching the first episodes, which I thought were pretty

          <span style="display: none;" id="review149321">
        decent, I forgot that both Elfen Lied and this series are by the same author, Lynn Okamoto, and it seems that he doesn´t have the ability to learn from her mistakes.<br />
<br />
The show began pretty well in my opinion presenting us with a serious and dark story, and even if it is unoriginal, it is of my belief that an unoriginal story done the right way, can be a really enjoyable show to watch. We get presented to our main characters Murakami and Kuroha, and we also get presented to Kana afterwards in the second episode. I thought the mystery was nicely done and it kept me going back to this show week after week.<br />
<br />
I thought Murakami was, at first, a really decent protagonist, he was pretty smart and could formulate some desperate but effective plans to get out of the dangerous situations he got into, but as series went on he ended up being only that REALLY nice guy, who is willing to sacrifice his life for saving others, and then end up being saved by some Deus ex-Machina, because, you know, he is the protagonist. But I will get back to the Deus ex- Machina later.<br />
Kuroha was pretty much the typical childhood friend main love interest, she wasn´t really annoying but she wasn´t the greatest of the characters either, she didn´t have much personality either, apart from being the &quot;I think I´m in love with the protagonist&quot; character.<br />
Kana was also a so-so character, her personality is pretty much like the typical tsundere, again not really annoying but not great either.<br />
<br />
Then another character, Kazumi, got presented and there is when the show took  downward spiral, because around episode four, when they were just in the end of a really serious scene, the scene afterwards, suddenly, out of nowhere, we got fanservice and comedy, and that really took a hit on the show. The sudden changes between serious and light-hearted with comedy and fanservice avoided me from having the ability to take this show seriously. How can I get invested in a dark and serious story if they are trying to get me horny at the same time?<br />
The main problem here is Kazumi, which is probably the second worst character of the series, she is a pervert that is constantly firting with the main protagonist, Murakami, and is the cause of most of the fanservice scenes that can screw an episode on it´s entirety.<br />
This got repeated almost every episode which really made me want to drop this show sometimes.<br />
<br />
Then in the final episodes that´s where the REAL nosedive kicks in, as we get presented to other girls, I will focus only in the most important, as the others don´t really have that much screentime, and aren´t really interesting. This is where Kotori gets presented. Kotori is the most annoying character of the series following the &quot;Big tits shy girl&quot; archetype, and all she really does in the series is saving Murakami from lethal situation, because she has the most useful power, and the other thing she does is stutter, A LOT, it´s really annoying.<br />
After that the show starts to use Deus ex-Machinas a lot of the time with the objective of saving Murakami, pretty much defying physics, logic and human anatomy in the process, it seems as if someone thought I´m stupid and I wouldn´t notice this things.<br />
<br />
In the art department nothing much really stands out. The character designs are normal and the color palette is pretty generic. Is constant and it doesnt´t really take any nosedive, I will give them that, but this is studio ARMS we´re talking about, they have never been in the peak of digital animation, and with this show, they failed to prove that the can do something actually decent. Apart from that the artwork is just above average.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack, apart from the first OP is pretty forgettable, with nothing much really standing out. I can´t really judge the voice acting since I don´t speak japanese, but if there´s one voice that really annoys me, is Kotori´s, her loud voice and constant stuttering almost drive me insane.<br />
The first OP however is quite a piece, is an instrumental techno theme mixed with vocal choirs, and it was that glimmer of hope that made me thought that this show would redeem itself eventually, until it was replace by a death metal song by Fear, and loathing in Las Vegas, which not only didn´t fit the show, it was badly synchronised with the OP´s animation. Who had the brilliant idea to change the opening!? I will make sure he suffers when I kill him.<br />
<br />
My enjoyment on the show was ruined by the aforementioned light-hearted comedy and fanservice that doomed this show, and if you add the aforementioned Deus ex-Machina, and what is easily one of the worst ending that I have ever seen, you will have me trying to destroy my head with a shotgun.<br />
<br />
Final Judgement:<br />
Gokukoku no Brynhildr started with a pretty decent note, and then it entered a downward spiral, teaching me a valuable lesson: &quot;Never watch an ARMS anime adaptation of a Lynn Okamoto´s manga ever again.&quot;. Really, does Okamoto even learn from his mistakes? Or he has his head so full of &quot;Elfen Lied is a masterpiece&quot; that he just had to write the same thing with the same problems again, adding an alien twist to it?<br />
It´s characters range from the forgettable to the utterly annoying, it´s story cannot be taken seriously due to the amount of stupid comedy and fanservice that it has, added to a shitty ending and Deus ex-Machinas. The art and sound departments are only above average.<br />
A show that ended up being a complete disappointment and is not recommended for those looking something good this season.<br />
<br />
This has been The Neko and I hope that you found this review helpful and that you have a pleasant day, night, or whatever.<br />
This adorable kitty is leaving the scene.

    **UPDATE** Damn this anime is getting bad reviews xD I get that it&#039;s similar to Elfen Lied (that&#039;s one of my favs) But you should never heavily compare the two even if it is by the same person who wrote it. <br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t Elfen Lied. This is a completely different anime. Jeezz people.<br />
<br />
Harem &amp; Sci-fi; weird combination, right? But this anime makes it work. I&#039;m usually not a huge harem fan, but this one is a win in my book. Probably because it&#039;s not heavily focused on it. I didn&#039;t actually expect to like this anime so much. Whether it was the summary or just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review149283">
        a feeling; I was wrong. This just blew my expectations!<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10- This anime. Wow. Brynhildr has a way of making you think a little. You don&#039;t know what&#039;s coming next, and when you do, it&#039;s twisted into something completely different. Suspense is a high factor in this anime, and it makes it great! There are so many parts you don&#039;t expect, but it happens. It could be a funny, perverted scene or a character death. The story never fails to keep you on the edge of your seat!<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10- The animation was great. The colors were the basic &quot;Sci-fi&quot; type of feel. Nothing is too colorful or bubbly, but more of a darker feel. Which is what you want in an anime like this. Overall fairly simple but pleasant.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10- I do admire the OPs very much. The first one was just mysterious music with interesting animation to follow. It really draws you in. the second one isn&#039;t probably for everyone since it is almost a metal type. But if you like that genre, than you&#039;ll like it too! And the ED is surprisingly cheerful. Which is nice if you have such a dramatic episode. Overall, the music ties everything together.<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10- In a mystery themed anime you never really know what to expect in development. But I thought each character had a decent background. Some of the supporting ones are left unchecked, but that&#039;s to be expected. The main characters on the other hand, have just enough development that you want to know more about them, but you already have knowledge of them. So it leaves you with more questions than answers, but that&#039;s all part of the game, right? &gt;;3<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10- I was about 4 episodes behind before I caught up last week, but woah. This anime hits a home run in everything you expect it to. It shows mystery, hell, the ending definitely does. It&#039;s about witches, and as childish as it sounds, the fantasy factor of this anime is anything but child&#039;s play. But of course, it is sci-fi themed! The drama will leave you wanting to continue watching to see what happens next. Though there are the perverted scenes, it doesn&#039;t seem to fail to make you smile or laugh! In all, this anime was great &amp; probably will only grow in fam ^^ [But at this rate with all the terrible reviews, I&#039;m not so sure]<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10- Loved it and hope many others will agree :3 [they don&#039;t lol] But hey, there&#039;s over 100 chapters in the manga. So I can only assume another season is heading are way, don&#039;t you think? ;)

    Brynhildr in the Darkness is an anime based on a manga by Lynn Okamoto, known for his infamous work of gore-feasting Elfen Lied. Oh yes, Elfen Lied. The one that is filled with bloody horror and messy gore scenes that mesh together pedophilia, gore, cruelty, horror, and nudity into one single piece. To be honest, it was quite shocking when this anime came out. I nearly thought it was a new version of Elfen Lied. But this one appears to be more laidback as it is so full of comedy, new concepts, and plot, with good character development that connects the past and present. In

          <span style="display: none;" id="review198674">
        a sense, this one is much more lovely and fun to watch. <br />
<br />
Story<br />
If there is one word that can fully describe the whole plot, it is romance. It has a really good and cute romance development between its characters. They are just so much fun to watch and the main cast is loveable. If you are, by chance, a romance fan, you will love it! The story itself is pretty amazing if I had to say. It had mysterious vibes all around every episode as it got tense and deeper along the way. The character has been slowly developed over time and its plot development is noteworthy enough to be mentioned. It&#039;s a fresh one after so many clichéd animes that you have probably watched. The theme of losing one memory, with its dark tones and twist, has made the anime&#039;s potential far better than its peers. The story tells us about one high schooler named Ryouta, a boy who vaguely remembers the promise that he made to his childhood friend Kuroneko. The promise itself is nothing special, aside from a mere dream of a kid, which is to see real aliens. But the promised day was the beginning of Ryouta&#039;s accursed fate, as Kuroneko died while trying to save him from falling. His grief and regret just kept growing even after years. And Ryouta decides to keep hold of his promise even in high school. In which, to find the real aliens that Kuroneko wants to see. But, one day, the wheel of fate starts to spin again when he meets a new transfer student named Kuroha Neko. The past will begin to unfold its story again with a bigger destiny that Ryouta could never have imagined. Which is a path full of thorns and grief, to rediscover what&#039;s happening on that promised day. <br />
<br />
Art<br />
The art is very cute and great. It is a clean animation that is full of color. I loved the art and animation of Kuroneko. Such a cutie. <br />
<br />
Sound<br />
Honestly, its Op is kinda great. It is a song that brims with this uneasy feeling as things start to get worse. In contrast, the ending is much more catchy and lively. But the Op for sure is fabulous. How fabulous? It’s like the classic meme of Bitch please, I&#039;m fabulous. <br />
<br />
Character<br />
I love the characters&#039; growth and development. Kuroneko herself is just so cute! Her expressions are so innocent and are always my favorite part of the show. She makes the whole show more entertaining and interesting than it is supposed to be. I will keep saying it&#039;s marvelous and marvelous until you get bored of it. The other girls are fine as well, but my favorite one will always be Kuroneko. <br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
I want to give this anime the masterpiece rating that it is supposed to deserve, but I really can&#039;t, unfortunately. While I do enjoy some of its moments and everything else that it has managed to offer, the series&#039; pace itself was way too rushed. There are just so many things that have been left unanswered. While it does happen to be nonsense from time to time, it still lives up to its name as the predecessor of the Elfen Lied in terms of gore scenes. Still, the Gokukoku series does have its flaws that are far from perfect, but its demerits don’t stop this show from being a personal favorite of mine. In a sense, I loved this series.

    I thought overall this was a pretty good series and deserves a decent rating. Not a perfect one but a decent one. I think it suffers most from failing to meet peoples expectations than it does from the product itself. Yes it was rushed but that doesn&#039;t make it terrible.<br />
<br />
First off this isn&#039;t Elfen Lied. Yes it&#039;s by the same author and has various similarities but it&#039;s not meant to be a duplicate and doesn&#039;t necessarily appeal to the same crowd. This isn&#039;t even really a horror/gore series, Inuyasha had more gore and it isn&#039;t considered a gore series. Brynhildr is primarily a dark drama

          <span style="display: none;" id="review152567">
        with light comedy(despite not being tagged comedy).<br />
<br />
Second this series was admittedly rushed and if you read the manga you would have been disappointed that they skipped a significant amount of storyline and character development. Would this series have been better if it was 24 episodes and stuck to the manga? Absolutely, I&#039;d probably be giving it a 10 if that were the case.<br />
<br />
From the writers perspective it&#039;s a toss-up if you were sure you weren&#039;t going to get a second season would it be better to make a developed series that stops halfway or a rushed series that&#039;s complete. Hard to say, but what I can say is that I&#039;ve seen complete series that weren&#039;t nearly as well developed as this and they weren&#039;t getting ratings of 2.<br />
<br />
Now onto the storyline itself. The basic plot is fairly generic, MC protecting a group of girls from an evil organization of course it has it&#039;s own spin on this. Nothing really great or bad there. I do think the blending of comedy and drama was one of the strengths in this series, some may think it was a waste of time in an already rushed series, but that&#039;s part of character development. It&#039;s the light-hearted comedy moments that endear you to the characters so you actually give a crap when they&#039;re about to get killed later. I&#039;ve seen people complain on other series that all the friends do is rescue each other when they&#039;re in danger and never actually have fun so why are they friends to begin with? That&#039;s why this series tries to show that they have happy times when they&#039;re not fighting to survive. They&#039;re lives aren&#039;t constant fighting and carnage. If you&#039;re looking for nonstop action and gore than your better of watching Deadman Wonderland.<br />
<br />
I will say the series had a bit more fanservice than was necessary though I find that to be the case in a lot of series. I thought Murakami was a good lead better than 80% of the MCs I see. He wasn&#039;t Lelouch but he was one of the intelligent strategist types and was fairly courageous and competent. Neko was pretty weak and generic overall unfortunately and didn&#039;t get much development. I did like Kana and Kazumi in particular both were fairly interesting and had some development. Kazumi in particular lost a lot of development from the manga but still ended up getting more than Neko. Hatsuna on the other hand was introduced at the end and got almost no development. Kotori was pretty annoying, even in the manga, I tend to think the writers didn&#039;t bother with her development (for reasons that would be apparent if you watched the series).<br />
<br />
The villains were pretty interesting a stoic mad-scientist trying to play god and a psychotic yandere. Not unprecedented but still intimidating enough to take seriously and a still a better motive than the standard world domination.<br />
<br />
I though the art was pretty good again nothing new and amazing but still better than a lot of series. The opening song was a favorite of mine and I thought it fit the series perfectly though the second seemed pretty random and didn&#039;t work as well.<br />
<br />
Overall if you ignore the manga this is still a good series worth watching, it won&#039;t necessarily make your top 10 but its a solid series and still better than most of the stuff out there.<br />
If you have seen the series I would highly recommend reading the manga because it does have much better pacing and development and very well may make your top 10

    Let me start off by saying this:<br />
I do not like to talk down about anime. I an usually incredibly unbiased and I have an appreciation for every anime released... to some extent.<br />
I don&#039;t like to be negative and I don&#039;t like to write reviews that could sound hurtful to some people. But with Brynhildr, there is a problem. The problem is that I cannot understand why there are little-to-no contrasting opinions on this anime yet. Everything I&#039;ve seen/read so far has been generally positive and praising the anime. I don&#039;t get it... isn&#039;t that unnatural? It&#039;s not that great...is it?<br />
<br />
No, it&#039;s not. There must be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review146421">
        some kind of brainwashing going on here because this is NOT what it&#039;s hyped up to be. I have never been so heartbroken by an anime until I started Brynhildr. As early as episode 2 it was already kicking me in the shins. I&#039;m writing this review to protect the rest of you who are anything like me from wasting your time on something that isn&#039;t what people say it is.<br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
With a writer like Lynn Okamoto (Elfen Lied), I had expectations that this would be a tightly nit, well presented masterpiece with clever and artistic references to various lore and culture. Well... it does that... sort of... but Brynhildr lays it on a bit too thick and really has no idea what it wants to be. I&#039;ve never seen a story change direction and pace as often and randomly as this. It&#039;s way too distracting going from a dark, mysterious, bloodbath, to a cheesy fan-service episode in the next minute like nothing even happened.<br />
<br />
A lot of this anime&#039;s praise comes from the loyal fans who read the manga. While I haven&#039;t read the manga, I can assure you that what they say is true about &quot;The manga is great! You should read it!&quot; However... that doesn&#039;t change the fact that this is an absolute mess of an adaptation. I haven&#039;t read the manga personally, but I can tell this anime has already skipped way too much explanation and jumped to highlights for theatrical effect. With that comes a completely dislodged story line, rapidly introduced characters with little exposition, and a story that just feels cluttered and difficult to follow. It truly is a disaster and I don&#039;t know why even the manga fans can&#039;t agree that this is not what it was intended to be.<br />
<br />
Now maybe you like a story that&#039;s got witches and aliens and pharmaceuticals, and sci-fi... and astronomy.... and... happy-go-lucky fanservice, and molesting defenseless paralyzed girls... oh.. and freaking mouth lasers!!! But honestly if they picked ONE concept and stuck with it, this story could have been significantly better. Tasteless is all I can say.<br />
<br />
Art 6/10<br />
Not much to say here about the art. It&#039;s mediocre. It&#039;s not bad but it&#039;s definitely not a selling feature. If there&#039;s on thing I can compliment, it&#039;s that the very median color palette sits right in the middle for the show&#039;s dark, bloody aspects and absurd silliness the very next instant. It is exactly average. And it is exactly the kind of hint that what you&#039;re getting into is not anything special. At least it&#039;s not misleading you by looking absolutely stunning and then delivering a garbage plot.<br />
<br />
Sound 7/10<br />
Sound effects here and there are sketchy. I hear a decent amount of recycled effects in this anime from cats to gunshots that really don&#039;t have a strong feel to them. The music may be the only saving grace with a unique and catchy dubstep-esque OP song.<br />
<br />
Characters 5/10<br />
I really don&#039;t want to rant too long about the characters, but all I can say is they are all extremely shallow and not developed enough. They introduce so many characters in the short time this anime is allotted so nobody gets the exposition they deserve. Not even the main character has a convincing back story or motivation for anything that he does involving the characters surrounding him.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, the only characters that feel genuine are the girl who&#039;s incredibly perverted and lusty. given her short life-expectation I can understand the psychology that would drive her to those decisions. And the paralyzed girl. I&#039;m sure if she could walked, she would&#039;ve have ditched the other girls by now and found some better friends who don&#039;t take advantage of her disability. She seems like the only character who understands the situations that arise, but nobody will give her the credit.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 4/10<br />
I don&#039;t drop anime, ever. I always see it to the end no matter what. But this show tempted me so hard and so early on that I nearly left it at episode 2. As of now, I&#039;ve only seen 9 episodes, but I plan to finish it out as scheduled. But I don&#039;t think these remaining 4 episodes will be strong enough to pull this anime out of the deep hole it&#039;s already dug itself into. I can&#039;t be swayed any other direction, no matter how amazing the ending might be. I really do not enjoy watching this and I don&#039;t see how so many people can claim it&#039;s the best of the season.<br />
<br />
Overall 5/5<br />
Okay seriously. For me to write a negative review (especially before even completing an anime) is a bad sign. It means something is up. You don&#039;t have to agree with my words, but I want you guys to see the other side of the spectrum when all I see is constant glorification for Brynhildr. I simply isn&#039;t justified honor. I know there are people out there with similar taste to me and I&#039;m writing this to protect you. I have a group of 5 friends that all watch anime together and we all agree that this is an utter waste of time.<br />
<br />
Like me or not, that is what I have to say. I rarely offer my negative opinions, but this needed to be said.<br />
If you agree with me, I&#039;d greatly appreciate voting this review for helpfulness. If not, I&#039;m sorry I offended you, but there really is no room to only leave positive feedback on something that is clearly not what it&#039;s hyped-up to be. Thanks.

    From the writers of the famous anime, Elfen Lied, they present you &quot;Gokukoku no Brynhildr&quot;, in my opinion, a failure of an anime for the ages. Have you ever seen an anime that tries to encompass romance, ecchi, psychological, horror, magic action, schi-fi, drama, mystery, and fantasy all in one and fails miserably? Well, look no further, Gokukoku no Brynhildr is certainly one of those anime. One of Gokukoku&#039;s many problems was that it couldn&#039;t decide which direction they wanted to go with the anime: was it going to be a mystery with love? Or an anime filled with psychological traumas/problems? Or an anime filled

          <span style="display: none;" id="review162421">
        with magic action? Or just a pure ecchi series?<br />
<br />
The plot revolves around a simple boy named Ryouta Murakami, who has a photographic memory. As a child, he was in love with his friend, Neko Kuroha who believed in aliens, and claimed to have met them. But Kuroha dies in an accident trying to save Murakami. Filled with guilty, Murakami promises himself not to fall in love with anyone other than his first love and also to find proof of the existence of aliens because of a promise he had made with Kuroneko prior to her death. Then fast forward to the present, and one day, a new transfer student comes to his class, who not only looks a lot like Kuroha Neko, but is named Kuroha Neko and to add onto that, she saves Murakami with magical powers. It turns out that Kuroha along with Kuroha&#039;s alliance witches are run-a-way witches who were created by a mysterious organization. These witches need strange pills (that only the organization has) in order to survive, or else their skin melts/spews out blood and they die. Oh, did I mention that the organization is sending other more powerful witches to hunt down the run-a-way witches? Therefore Murakami, who wants to protect Kuroha Neko (and also the other run-a-way witches) in order to find out of Kuroha Neko really is the Kuroha Neko he knew as a child, gets entangled into a witch hunt down death chase.  <br />
<br />
Although this type of anime not my favorite to begin with, Gokukoku no Brynhildr really made me cringe. First off, so many unanswered questions. Why did the organization create these witches? No idea. Why did the organization want to hunt them down then? No idea. Okay... Then what was the point of the anime? Um, there was none? I mean it&#039;s basically another story that has a few glimpses of terrible, boring magic battle scenes, that shows 2-3 witches swinging their arms around, creating huge explosions, with the addition of Murakami being hit on by all sorts of different girls (witches). I absolutely despise ecchi, and Gokukoku no Brynhildr, a supposedly horror, mysterious anime had tons of it. I don&#039;t even want to talk about the ending, because there was no climax, the ending made absolutely no sense, and most importantly, it was unsatisfying to say the least. Overall, the plot jumped around too much, without having a focus point leading to it&#039;s messy demise. <br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t dislike the characters as much as the plot because there was 1 or 2 interesting side characters. But the anime sort of threw out random characters out of nowhere, and then got rid of them just as fast. There was no depth to any characters, except maybe Murakami and Kuroha (but not really). The characters were your average ecchi anime characters. There was the main male character who is an perverted boy that is kind towards other female characters, no matter who they are, therefore causing the other girls to fall in love with him. The main female character who is beautiful, yet reluctant to admit her feelings of the main character. The short, funny, flat-chested female character who messes around the main character (Kazumi, the one character I liked). And, obviously the big-boobed dumb, high pitched voice character that the main character is tempted to &quot;touch&quot;. The villain and the mysterious organization were nothing really; there was no explanation of them. The entire anime gives us perhaps a 1 minute flashback of the antagonists past that explains absolutely nothing of his intentions or reasons. What happened to the organization in the end? No idea, they just suddenly were dropped at the end of the story, when they were the whole &quot;mysterious&quot; focus. And.. in conclusion, I really dislike anime where they make the characters all have different hair color to distinguish upon them; it usually shows the art team&#039;s lack of effort to drawing up diversely looking characters. <br />
<br />
The art is okay, but it didn&#039;t fit the mood of the anime. The anime was supposed to be a horror, mystery anime that maybe had a glimpse of romance between the 2 main characters, yet the art was so colorful, bright, and &quot;romantic&quot;. I know that some people like the Gokukoku no Brynhildr openings, but I personally did not like the openings, because of it&#039;s VERY high pitched dub-step kind of music (1st opening was okay). There is no other worth mentioning soundtrack in the anime. The voicing cast did a decent job, hence giving sound a 5 rating, despite it&#039;s lack of any good music.<br />
<br />
In a simple conclusion: I wouldn&#039;t recommend this anime to really anyone.

    Second chances are not to be wasted, and this is no exception to the anime industry. VAP, Inc. and Arms Corporation took another shot at bringing one of Lynn Okamoto’s works to the big screen and blew its potential once again. Gokukoku no Brynhildr introduces an intriguing mystery and new concept of witches that have a promising start but resulted in something unforgivable with ridiculous plot devices. Because of the eerie OP and attractive plot, it is easy to expect a well-done mystery with proper supernatural aspects. Instead, there are incompetent characters, sorry excuses for villains, and poor pacing that leads to plotholes and a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review149835">
        lack of character development.<br />
<br />
Gokukoku’s initial mystery escalates into the supernatural, appearing as something to look forward to. The plot seems suspenseful with a unique concept for witches, who have different powers and live in fear of melting. Unforeseen circumstances brought interest. The characters had their own distinct personalities and unfortunate histories to give high hopes for the story. It was those elements that made me fall for Gokukoku in the beginning, but the show took a turn for the worst. The story became heavily predictable with the same pattern as expected from a harem that consists of a gullible and overly caring male protagonist (Murakami). A so-called powerful witch appears, and Murakami feels the need to persuade her to join the group 90% of the time. This eliminates the potential for suspense and becomes disinteresting. <br />
<br />
The ending is so rushed and vague that it ruins the outcome of the mysteries. New info about the MCs is revealed near the end, leaving little time for the viewer to take it all in. A character is supposed to have indestructible powers, but the power is either never shown or is unimpressive with no terrifying element. New characters appear out of nowhere before the current characters have any time to develop. Despite the sudden and distressful situations, there’s no chance to feel sympathy for characters. The finale is extremely disappointing, especially for someone looking forward to a solved mystery. There are several questions left unanswered.<br />
<br />
The pacing distracts itself with fanservice, resulting in making Murakami a typical love interest. A love triangle develops and creates a silly jealousy game. Virgin talk and awkward erotic moments make the show irresistibly a sight for sore eyes. This withdraws any hope for possible romance within the mystery between Murakami and Neko. The harem aspect is understandable considering the witches&#039; sob stories and dreams of living life as normal human beings instead of experiments. Their interactions with each other and teamwork were enjoyable, especially during drastic moments. However, this progresses into awful characterization.<br />
<br />
The cast made this sci-fi production a complete failure. Villains do not fit the description of someone evil. When they can easily defeat the MCs, they make illogical choices as an excuse to work out in the favor of the protagonist. The majority of the witches introduced as formidable turns out to be harmless. The other characters’ emotions are ridiculous for a serious plot. Either they’re trying too hard to react to a situation or they just don’t care. They sometimes act so calm, cool, and collected that the story doesn’t make sense anymore. They go as far as faking a death with the evidence right beside them. Also, Murakami apparently has such solid gold talents and abilities that he’s invincible to various attacks. One witch became nothing but a dues ex machina character, giving Murakami outside info to further the objective. At that point, the show appears silly and tiring to watch. <br />
<br />
The art is decent but doesn&#039;t help in terms of the story. Character design is fine, and it&#039;s good for distinguishing the witches&#039; special features. Some things don’t follow up in the artwork, including the witches standing out as the only students without uniforms. Thanks to a scene with characters using red paint as fake blood, there’s no differentiation between the color of blood and red paint. What’s worse for a series that tries to be all bloody and mysterious? Censorship. So if you want to see a witch melt to the fullest degree, just watch the Wizard of Oz. The animation and action scenes are good, but it becomes pointless to enjoy with the rushed pacing.<br />
<br />
The OST and sound effects are good, but the poor story and characters cause it be plain. Apart from being misleading with the bloody scenes and action, the first OP song is good and a personal favorite. The background music occurred during fighting scenes that ended with characters making stupid moves, so it’s not so memorable. They changed the OP song into a rock song by the 10th episode with the same suspense and action as the first one. By that time, the show is predictable enough to lose any hope of improvement. Characters’ phony reactions disappoint long-awaited moments for mysteries. This is noticeable for scenes that should be highly emotional. Technically, there’s nothing else to say about the seiyuu. Since it becomes normal for wicked witches to develop into sensitive little girls, the changes in their tones fit the script. <br />
<br />
Gokukoku no Brynhildr has countless problems that makes it forgettable. The characters don’t act realistically to situations. The villains make irresponsible decisions that lessens the suspense within the show. More time spent on fanservice than the mysteries results in quick pacing, lack of character development, and a horrible ending. It is a huge disappointment for an interesting mystery. Despite how much VAP and Arms ruined Gokukoku&#039;s potential, Lynn Okamoto created an excellent story. Therefore, I recommend reading the manga for better characterization and outcomes.

    “Just shut up and show me your armpits”<br />
<br />
Having that as an important and plot relevant quote during the first episode of a show should be more than enough to tell you what you&#039;re going to be dealing with for the next 13 episodes. Gokukoku no Brynhildr does not disappoint in that regard. You are treated to a full season worth of ridiculous shenanigans, colorful characters, and downright nonsensical plot devices. Watching this show with your brain turned off is highly suggested since trying to comprehend everything in a logical fashion may turn you into a pile of goo. People who come into this show expecting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review149703">
        well thought out characters and a coherent plot are quite naive in my opinion. One just has to look at the original creator&#039;s previous works to understand where it all comes from. <br />
<br />
Flashback to 2004...the economy is doing well, we have a strong Republican in the White House, and things seem to moving in the right direction. However, 2004 was also the year that a rather infamous anime aired. Elfen Lied was its name and it has been well known ever since for its excessive usage of nudity, gore, and over the top drama.  Even today it is still discussed by edgy teens and casual anime viewers due to its ridiculousness. Surprisingly, the creator of that has gotten yet another anime adaption. However, unlike Elfen Lied, Gokukoku no Brynhildr lacks much of the over the top drama and suggestive themes. The lack of fetish pandering is another peculiar aspect of this show (provided you don&#039;t like armpits), it was highly prevalent in Elfen Lied and is a mainstay in Studio ARMS shows. However, Gokukoku no Brynhildr featured almost none of it. What was also shown was incredibly tame and certainly intended for the more modern TV regulations. In a sense, that would seem to be a huge benefit to the show, but in reality it drags it down to something a bit more plain and mediocre. Skipping out on excessive fanservice or gore in a show like this is a mistake in my opinion since it doesn&#039;t have anything else pulling the weight, the usage of cheap tricks such as exploding heads or gratuitous pantyshots are required. Regardless, the story of Gokukoku no Brynhildr shares many likenesses to that of the creator&#039;s previous work in the vein of it being young girls with supernatural powers and a shadowy organization behind it all. This is nothing new or groundbreaking so it should be overlooked since it quickly changes from being a backdrop to a main focus in the story throughout the show. Therefore, the story of the show is easily by far the weakest point. It ranges from ridiculous to downright terrible throughout each episode. As previously mentioned, turning your brain off is something that is highly suggested since you can actually enjoy the other parts of the show if you&#039;re not focusing on the gaping plot holes and terrible pacing. <br />
<br />
In many cases, characters can make or break a show and in the case of Gokukoku no Brynhildr, they are the one thing holding the show together. The entire cast is likable in their own ways and the interactions between them are enjoyable to watch. However, this does not mean they are without flaws. The characters themselves are poorly thought out and their actions turn the majority of the show into an unintentional comedy. The viewer is often treated to situations where the characters act in downright idiotic ways which can be quite frustrating at times. Regardless, there is a strange sense of charm with the character interactions and it is largely enjoyable. However, as previously stated, the viewer should try to ignore the majority of the plot related character interactions and just focus on the ridiculous shenanigans if you want to enjoy yourself. <br />
<br />
In regards to art and sound, Gokukoku no Brynhildr does not stand out in any way. The art feels a bit dated and lacks in detail, most likely due to a mix of budgetary concerns and the source material itself. It is rather inoffensive though and it is on par with what one would expect from a Studio ARMS anime Curiously though, the fanservice that is prominent in ARMS shows is lacking in this show. As previously mentioned, the smut levels have been certainly turned down compared to Elfen Lied and that surprisingly detracts from the overall viewership experience. In addition, the art somehow feels less detailed and cheaper in this more modern show which in itself reinforces the mediocre aura that this anime has. In terms of sound, the seiyuu do a good job in their respective roles and the OST is on point. The sound is something that I will not complain about since it completely acceptable. However, there was a strange change in the opening song starting from episode 10. Some people may dislike hearing the Japanese equivalent of Attack Attack or The Devil Wears Prada, which is completely understandable since can hardly be considered music. For me, it reminded me of the wonderful mid 2000s where I hung around Hot Topic and had glow in the dark pants so I didn&#039;t mind it nearly as much. <br />
<br />
Saying that you enjoyed something is a tricky situation. Despite all of its glaring flaws, I will admit that I enjoyed Gokukoku no Brynhildr (up until the last episode at least). I probably enjoyed it more than I should have since I actually looked forward to watching it each week. It is certainly a guilty pleasure type show and I would imagine that many other people have a similar opinion of it. I found it to be incredibly funny in parts and the characters were very entertaining. The show was nothing spectacular in any sense, but it was very entertaining even if it was for the wrong reasons. However, if someone asked me if I would recommend watching this show, I would grit my teeth and say no. In the end, memorable shows are either famous or infamous. Gokukoku no Brynhildr is neither of those, I am sure it will be forgotten rather quickly. It just doesn&#039;t have enough going for it, negative or positive, to make a mark on the viewer for better or for worse. If you are looking for a coherent sci-fi anime or one with gratuitous fanservice, there are much better options out there.

    **SPOILER FREE REVEIW**<br />
<br />
Gokukoku no Brynhildr, or &quot;Bryhildr in the Darkness&quot;, is a Spring 2014 anime brought to us by Lynn Okamoto, the writer of Elfen Lied (which I&#039;ll be making a lot of comparisons to), but anyone who has seen Elfen Lied probably would have been able to guess that pretty easily. Why? Because while both of these shows have some great ideas, they are both equally inept when it comes to the concept of tone. They both think that they can show an upbeat fanservice scene centered around jiggling boobs and a brutal/disturbing bloodbath within 2 minutes of each other and act as if

          <span style="display: none;" id="review145441">
        the transition was seemless. GnB has an interesting story concept and looked to be on the right track at first, but its complete lack of direction prevents it from becoming a good anime; it doesn&#039;t know if it wants to be dark and disturbing or happy and upbeat nor does it know what direction it wants to take its plot.<br />
<br />
Synopsis: The story opens with a flashback centered around the protagonist, Murakami, and his infatuation with a girl named Kuroneko, who has an obsession with finding proof that aliens are real. A tragic accident occurs and Kuroneko dies while Murakami is left seriously wounded in the hospital. Years go by and Murakami dedicates himself to finding proof of the existence of aliens in honor of his dead friend. Then, one day, a new transfer student comes to his class, who not only looks a lot like Kuroneko, but is named Kurohaneko. Even though she insists on never having met Murakami before, the girl has superhuman strength and seems to even be able to predict the future; Murikami now has to figure out what the hell is going on.<br />
<br />
One of the problems with this show is that I feel like I&#039;ve already seen it; this is basically Elfen Lied with everything toned down. Less fanservice, less &quot;WTF&quot; moments, less blood, less action, less everything. They should rename this show Diet Elfen Lied. It maintains all of the same problems that the original had but doesn&#039;t have the same shock factor, and since shock factor was basically the only reason to watch Elfen Lied, that is a very bad thing. Additionally, The plot is completely unfocused; it starts with Murakami meeting two witches who are wandering around using their powers to save lives, then that subplot is completely forgotten and the focus switches to trying to keep the witches alive, and then the alien subplot makes a short and random return only to disappear again… There is simply no direction or consistency to be found in GnB; it comes across as incoherent.<br />
<br />
Despite these obvious issues, it should be noted that I actually still liked this show after the first few episodes. It was undeniably flawed, but it was suspenseful and exciting. Now, however, it just feels like a horribly confused Slice of Life show. It has divulged into an extremely predictable hi-jinks-fest as Murakami forms a harem of witches. The plot simply becomes incapable of carrying the show; it transforms into generic fanservice with unbelievably cheesy plot-conveniences at this point (looking at you, episode 9) as Murakami and his harem dick around while creating contrived sexually-awkward situations for comedy. <br />
<br />
That brings us to the characters, who are quite awful. Murakami is the least believable character I&#039;ve seen in a long time; he has no flaws what so ever and cares about people he just met to an unreasonable extent. To top that off, he has very little personality. Kazumi is just unbelievably aggravating. Her only purpose  is to spew sexual comments and create awkward situations because it&#039;s supposed to be funny; it isn&#039;t. Kurohaneko is probably the best character, but that&#039;s not saying much. She is the only one who manages to both have a personality and not be annoying, so take that for what its worth… Actually, I take that back; she becomes increasingly annoying because she instantly latches on to every witch she sees and acts like they have been best friends for life despite the fact that they just met and the fact the other witch is, more often then not, trying to kill her. It&#039;s not believable in any way and it further perpetuates the fact that the characters have poor chemistry with one another. So in other words, there isn&#039;t a single character that I would consider to be good, however there are many I would consider to be bad.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, GnB tries to take on both serious/mature themes and happy/funny themes at the same time, but ends up with an absolute mess. We have seen shows take on both sides of the spectrum and still be successful before, such as FMA and Darker than Black, but GnB just doesn&#039;t seem to know what its doing. I&#039;m often bored watching this show because it fails to illicit any kind of emotional response from the audience at any point; it&#039;s not shocking, it&#039;s not funny, it&#039;s not entertaining (with the exception of a few scenes), it&#039;s not anything. Sure, it had a few decently suspenseful moments early on, but there is simply no motivating factor to keep you watching. You could easily just watch Elfen Lied and get the same sort of experience, but multiplied by 5, so what&#039;s the point? I don&#039;t recommend this show to anyone.

    Ah, the age old question: do aliens exist?<br />
<br />
It’s a topic that has been debated for centuries. But for Ryouta Murakami, he’s not looking for aliens to be famous or for science. Rather, he’s looking for aliens because of a childhood past, one that changed his life forever. Gokukoku No Brynhildr (Brynhildr in the Darkness) tells the story of a world involving witches, beings with supernatural abilities that could change everything forever. <br />
<br />
From the author of the notorious Elfen Lied, Lynn Okamoto puts his ideas to the test once again in this sci-fi and experimental series. The general premise involves the young boy Ryouta who meets

          <span style="display: none;" id="review152027">
        Kuroneko, his childhood friend many years ago. For what’s worth, the mystery accelerator kicks in with an event that assumingly killed Kuroneko. In the present, he meets a girl going by the name “Neko Kuroha” with the exact same appearance as his childhood friend. At the same time, it’s known that pursuers from an “alien research lab” are going after her. It sets up the cat-and-mouse game where the loser won&#039;t get another chance.<br />
<br />
Establishing the show this way easily accomplishes the idea of a cat-and-mouse game. And you’re not wrong if this is your assumption. Throughout the show, their pursuers work ruthlessly to capture Neko regardless of who gets in their way. This is accomplished in various ways either by direct confrontation or sending other witches after them. Either way, the end goal is to bring back witches to their laboratory. Luckily though, the duo gets some unlikely help along the way with other witches such as Kazumi, Kana, and Katori. (the trio K ladies) As witches, each of them possess invaluable abilities that have saved their lives throughout the show. But as a group, they are known as the ‘Astronomy Club’, founded by Ryouta with the purpose to discover aliens.<br />
<br />
The overall concept of the show is halfhearted to say the least. Given the way the show is planned out, it’s no surprise that some people sees similarity to Elfen Lied. These include the childhood trope, experimentation, and special individuals with abilities. And while the show does have comedy, the dark reality constantly reminds us with the fact that they are being hunted. Initially, there is a prejudice against witches throughout the show. They are viewed as animals, treated like animals, and hunted down like animals. This is all for what they are just for the fact that they have special abilities. In raw form, the show depicts cruel experimentation on the witches behind the background with a twisted sense of horror. This shouldn’t be surprising though given Lynn’s writing. His concepts spawn from the very idea of experimentation with special individuals. What this show focuses on though is how to capture the other witches while Ryouta serves as their guardian. While this seems to be groundbreaking for its portrayal, the show suffers from balance. It’s a clear image the show will have a serious tone such as the OP song featuring bloodied spectrum of character montages. But for delivery, the show indulges itself with awkward comedy. While some of these actually has a purpose with foreshadowing, others are flat out cliché with edgy style. Not to mention, sexual innuendos are thrown all over the place with suggestive fan service and cheesy dialogue. In essence, the show makes fun of itself either unintentionally or go over dramatic when it comes to its humor. And this my friends, is not a good idea when adapting a dark story as it’s stupefying in its awkwardness. <br />
<br />
Another problem with the overall setup is the adaptation. With only 13 episodes, the show omits many details based on the manga of the same name. While it doesn’t completely annihilate satisfactory experience to get out of this show, it kills certain aspects of the story through omitting certain characters and story plot. Despite this though, it stays fairly consistent with adapting faithfully. The first episode chooses to deliver a somewhat concise setup with the two main characters introduced and letting the viewers know what they might expect. Hints such as the OP song, various flashbacks, and other dialogues/events gives an impression that the show has other mysteries than meets the eye. These could be related to the mechanics of the show, or more in specifically the machinations of the Witches. Terms such as ‘harnessed’ (pronounced like ‘her nest’) and research numbers designates the show as a sci-fi show with experimentation. The witches themselves are also referenced by Norse mythology with their names. But ultimately when it comes down to it, the witches are depicted as cliché characters by standards.<br />
<br />
That standard is shown through the relationship that Ryouta forms with them. As a kind and compassionate young boy, he has attracted the attention of the witches he has helped. Even though physically weak, he has the mind of a genius when it comes to devising clever tactics to evade capture. The girls/witches appreciate his efforts and not only earned their respect, but their affections. While some show it innocently with genuine thankfulness, others go with the more aggressive route such as Kazumi. Her ways of trying to get Ryouta to “do it” is saturated with direct sexual dialogues. On the other hand, Ryouta mostly shows ignorance and passes them off. In most cases, he is focused on survival rather than a relationship. In all though, it’s easy to see who Ryouta is interested in from the beginning just based on the premise. In retrospect, the connection Ryouta builds off with the characters is devoid of characterization but rather with stereotypical characteristics. Even with earnest honesty, the show prides itself with more oddball humor than characterizing its development. <br />
<br />
The show does pass the tests when it comes to action. In essence, the show details battles exclusively with focus on each witch and their potentials. Almost every witch shown in the series shows their ability with emphasis on their strength and weaknesses. The show also depicts them through categories of rankings to even give more consistency. For the action scenes itself, the show focuses on a bit of teamwork and risk. Ryouta is a gambler in the show and can keep viewers at the edge of their seat with his daring moves. In fact, some episodes are cliffhangers that can leave you anticipating what will happen next. Despite this though, some story plot devices are predictable and lacks interest when there’s heavy foreshadowing. Battles are also quick fashioned with a lack of moral sense most of the time except on a few occasions. Nothing to write home about though.<br />
<br />
Visually to the eyes, the show is violent when it comes to execution by studio ARMs. Blood is a common sight in the show and as a way to deconstruct some of the innocence of the girls. Other interesting artwork relates to cruel experimentations and the evidence of its shocking factors with extraterrestrial vibes. For character designs, there’s a wide variety as each witch has her own characteristics. Unfortunately, the show doesn’t hide its fan service (besides the censor). Classic onsen episodes are present and jokes are made about boob sizes. To further escalate this concept, characters such as Kotori becomes an epitome of admiration for her ‘sizes’. We also can’t forget about the jokes that Ryouta has to deal with when it comes to character interactions. How does that tie with service? The witches of course in particular, Kazumi and her mischievousness.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack has some influence on the show although it doesn’t entirely play a huge role. Technical wise, it’s well delivered and takes chances. By that, it means the show mixes comedic tones with darker and somber style for its OST. The result well mixed as the show itself pokes fun at itself. But when it comes to dark, the OP songs are a firm example to stand out on their own. The first OP song (played for the first 9 episodes) is unique with no lyrics but instead illustrate the dark undertone of the show. The second OP song has a similar style but with heavy metal lyrics to again to deliver its message – to show that the series should be taken seriously in respect. Otherwise, character voice mannerisms are decent. In particular, Kazumi’s kansai accent is noticeable while other times, the show make fun of itself with Kuroneko’s singing. <br />
<br />
When it comes to adaptations, Gokukoku no Bryhildr is a horrid example for its unsatisfactory balance of comedy and dark fantasy. It’s not mindless entertainment since the show has a premise and follows through it exclusively. But when it comes to humor, the show tries to mutate it into a late night comedy with disastrous effects. On the other hand, the characters offer a diverse category of personalities besides their inadequate development. With an adaptation of only thirteen episodes though, it’s injustice to skip material that should have been there. Ultimately, this show was a bomb, a failure of an experiment.<br />

    First of all, I&#039;ve never seen Elfen Lied so I will not mention that in the review at all. I will review based on just Gokukoku no Brynhildr. <br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
<br />
To me, the story was very unique. I haven&#039;t seen something this new in ages, because most of the anime I&#039;ve been watching (or re-watching) have been really repetitive. The story wasn&#039;t dragging out that much, though there would be happy scenes, then sad/serious scenes repeating in that order (mostly). The anime was very mysterious. I wanted to find out why that happened, or this happened. There is also harem and romance in this anime and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181317">
        that made the anime a bit better. The comedy (which wasn&#039;t tagged in the genres) was mostly about sex and virginity. If you&#039;re not into mild gore + romance and harem and you&#039;re more into the light-hearted comedy, normal life-type anime, then this anime isn&#039;t for you.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
<br />
The art was actually really nice. Very detailed characters, colors were nice and vibrant and smooth animation. Expected for an anime that was produced in 2014. <br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
<br />
The OST is played where it&#039;s necessary. There&#039;s no unnecessary OST playing, or an OST that doesn&#039;t mix the scene. The 1st OP fits the dark theme of the anime (the OP vid is really interesting) but I liked the 2nd OP better. I haven&#039;t heard an OP without vocals for a while. The ED is calm, to take off the dark theme from the anime.<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
<br />
The main characters were very interesting.<br />
<br />
Murakami Ryouta, the male protagonist. He&#039;s smart and has a special ability where if he sees something, he will remember that in full detail, like a scanner. He&#039;s very kind and would sacrifice his life to save another. <br />
<br />
Kuroha Neko, a girl that doesn&#039;t know a lot like her multiplication tables (lol) and still getting #1 on the finals. As time goes on, she starts to like Murakami. She&#039;s really pretty.<br />
<br />
Schlierenzauer (sch-ly-ren-za-oo-er i think) Kazumi, a girl who is a really good computer hacker and is smart. As she spends more time with Murakami, she starts to &#039;want&#039; him sexually. She&#039;s really kind and funny too.<br />
<br />
Tachibana Kana, the girl who can&#039;t move anything other than her left hand.<br />
She communicates with a keyboard. She calls mostly Murakami a molester but occasionally calls Kazumi a rapist. <br />
<br />
Takatori Katori, a woman who is fit to be a house wife because of her cooking skills. On first impressions, you will think she is a bad person but inside, she&#039;s a very kind girl.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know why, but I would be skipping to parts of the anime. It wasn&#039;t boring at all, but I guess I&#039;m really used to skipping. I would&#039;ve watched this anime in one sitting, but of course I have to sleep too.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
<br />
The anime is very nice, even though it&#039;s getting bad reviews. Would I re-watch it? Definitely.

    Gokukoku no Brynhildr or Brynhildr in the darkness is the anime adaptation of a manga created by the same mangaka who did the famous Elfen Lied. The show talks about an &quot;ordinary boy&quot; who comes in contact with girls called witches. Witches have some kind of power, every witch has it&#039;s own. So basically this guy meets a witch that looks like his lost childhood friend tries to help her and gets a harem.  <br />
<br />
Storry: The story is basically just like elfen lied only the girls have different powers, there is not much originality and much things are not clearly explained. The guy who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review149359">
        first looks like an ordinary boy turns out to have photographic memory and stuff. The pacing is off and the switches between &quot;tragic&quot; moments and harem/comedy moments were too random and ruined the mood (that was not great to begin with). Latter on the story just becomes inconsistent, things come out of fuc*** nowhere just for the &quot;shock factor&quot; but at that point the whole thing is already so stupid you don&#039;t care anymore.  <br />
1/10 <br />
<br />
<br />
Animation and sound : The only thing in the show I have no complains about. I mean it was not something great but it was not bad either. The sound was ok I guess, nothing memorable. The first OP was good the second one was pure trash, the OP was even used as part of the soundtrack. I forgot every single OST 30 min after completing the show, that shows how good it was.  <br />
6/10 <br />
<br />
Characters : Ordinary teenager with photographic memory which makes him immune to memory erasing? He suddenly comes up with amazing strategies that makes him look smart or some shit. He was the classic alpha male who gets bitches by acting as a hero. The girls were classic stereotypes , not much personality, the only thing I will remember of them is their naked bodies .  <br />
2/10 <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Probably the worst anime I have ever seen and I have seen about 800 at the time  am writing the review. This was worse then Mars Of Destruction and I am not kidding, this show is pure trash that should never be watched.  1/10 <br />
<br />
Overall : Really bad show with stupid asspulls annoying characters and a story that does not make sense 70% of the time( the other 30% is the fanservice/harem moments)  <br />
<br />
1/10 - Don&#039;t touch this piece of poo.

    Gokukoku no Brynhildr is a very cleverly disguised harem in the skin of a bleeding magician.<br />
<br />
The show is a clear example of a unique set of characters with great potential placed at the mercy of a poorly written plot and forced to move with it. This is evident in multiple parts of the anime whenever a plot point is introduced only to be glossed over. While this isn’t entirely noticeable at first glance, it becomes a reoccurring phenomenon that leaves the audience wondering “why?” <br />
<br />
One of the weakest points of the show is the lack of impact the supporting cast (Kogorou, Chisato, Nanami, etc) has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review151123">
        on the state of mind and motivational force of the main character. Almost every time they are introduced the main characters neither learn nor gain anything other than restating their raison d’etre and passing them off with little reflection. Furthermore, one of the worst offenses is having them being reduced to a simple plot device to conveniently move the main cast in a certain direction. When the show takes a turn toward the darker end of the spectrum the supporting cast seem to be conveniently present at times where the main characters need them the most. Then, as if to add salt onto the wound, emotional thresholds become melodramatic and seemingly misplaced. The main characters, namely Murakami, Kuroha, and Kazumi start acting as if they are on a checklist to cry at a given point of the show. <br />
<br />
It’s easy to call GnB dark and grim especially when we have death left and right. Though, the blood, melting, and secret organization are only a pretense to call it a “dark” show. Unfortunately, the show—in its vain attempt to show us tragedy—doesn’t build the right emotional motivation for us to feel attached to their characters. Because while supporting cast have attachments to the main cast, they served to do little in expressing the latter’s growth, thereby preventing the audience from vicariously feeling the main character’s loss. This is due to the poorly-written plot not making use of the supporting cast. In the end, the show leaves their deaths as an afterthought that forces us to simply accept the outcome and think “Thank god it wasn’t ______ who died.” <br />
<br />
The story of the show isn’t unique—and I’m sure many have seen the cliché of the “stubborn MC” who will “do all he can to protect these people” from some “evil organization” bent on doing some sort of “evil on the world.” What the story does do a good job of is making a common theme their own by twisting it into something familiar, yet new. It piques the audience’s curiosity by introducing a variety of powers specific to certain ‘magicians’ and having them categorized by strength. What makes the story more redeeming is Murakami and the group’s combination of their weaker powers to overcome seemingly impossible odds, not simply relying entirely on ass pulls. And though the planning stages, as well as the transparency of their plans aren’t always revealed immediately (which at first seems to set itself up as an ass pull) becomes a refreshing sight to see how things do work out when they pool their assets. <br />
<br />
Gokukoku no Brynhildr vainly introduces far too much to create their world and it resulted in disaster. Towards the end we are left with a bitter taste in the mouth with many loose ends and far too little questions answered. <br />

    One of the less appealing animes which was adapted poorly from a manga. This is from the point of view of a person who was previously reading the manga before the anime was announced. <br />
THIS REVIEW WILL BE STRICTLY BASED OFF OF THE ANIME!<br />
<br />
Story: The plot is not very well defined and is easily misinterpreted, I was lost multiple times watching this anime and it constantly felt like there were missing gaps as I watched the anime. The plot is an static plot of basically 1 antagonist who have many underlings who will do their bidding pressuring the existence of the main protagonist. Don&#039;t get

          <span style="display: none;" id="review149491">
        me wrong this main sound very boring and done multiple times but the character development happening during roughly the first 7 episodes are pure gold. After the beginning where every thing was nice, then the downfall of the anime occurs. They attempt to finish as much as they can within the 13 episode time frame causing difficulty understanding the anime as they have to ignore the important parts which helped the anime succeed after a while (character development).<br />
<br />
Art: The art style really suits the anime in my opinion, but it is average in general.<br />
<br />
Sound: The timing for the background music was very well done and I really enjoyed it all, I did have a slight problem with their choice of opening theme songs as I personally prefer songs that have singing. Other than that slight problem it was well done.<br />
<br />
Characters: There was a lack in character development in my opinion,  the entire story was too rushed for many development to occur. Also there were so many missed opportunities.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I really enjoyed the first 7 episodes or so, it was amazing to finally be given a chance to watch one of my favourite mangas turn in to anime. The timing for a good portion of the events were well timed and the use of music within the scenes came together really nicely.<br />
<br />
Overall: The anime is very unfriendly to their viewers as it provides: <br />
Liittle to no character development occurs due to the fact that the wanted to fit as much as they could in the small time frame given. Normally this wouldn&#039;t be as BIG as a problem but what they did was executed poorly due to the anime needing character development as it is one of the main selling points of the anime...<br />
<br />
Rushed events that are difficult to understand once again this is due to their given time constraints but if I were to suggest an idea, I would have stopped earlier within the anime but added more character development through small events.<br />
<br />
I suggest for all who has watched this anime to give the manga the chance if you really enjoyed the anime and want more.<br />

    Brynhildr of THE DARKNESSS Review:<br />
<br />
SYNOPSIS:<br />
A top secret military base who are super evil, experiments on females to make Super Aliens to do a bunch of random errands. One of the girls trying to escape some how ends up in our generic protagonists astronomy club, then he hunts more of them. Soon enough, poof! Harem happens- obvious fact. Now whose ready for SHOCK FACTOR!<br />
<br />
REVIEW:<br />
Lets start of with what most people flip there Kenichi&#039;s about... the gore factor... AKA- SHOCK FACTOR: <br />
At least in Elfen Lied they show fully uncensored gore and nudity, it was special back then because the gore mixed with the portrayal of nudity

          <span style="display: none;" id="review157391">
        and emotions of the characters with there harsh situations allowed us to at least sympathize with what there forced to do. Violence in present, have become mainstream of the years which looses it effect. In Brynhildr, they censored it because it was aiming for that mainstream garbage! It shows no respect of the audience as the characters have some crazy super powers to be used as plot armour, in fact, there completely one liner or worded and 100% archetype designed personalities is sufficient evidence that the show puts over there cool super powers over personalities which doesn&#039;t make anyone care! It maybe cool at first, but hear me out:<br />
 Don&#039;t know what’s going to happen next? See into the future! About to die? Regeneration! About to get killed? use Mind Control! All of this makes everything feel very forced and lack maturity. It lacks the realism and grey morality compared towards its older sister, at least the Horn Girls in Elfen kill people for survival as they are all being mistreated by man kind, which is totally understandable, but in here! The girls don&#039;t attack anyone because being captured means they&#039;re being tortured and experimented in this unethical manner if they come back to secret HQ laboratories. So they insist to runaway! As there only option, which limits a lot of interesting possibilities to make the show, “Better”<br />
<br />
Comparing towards the show&#039;s fan service terminology:<br />
At least in Elfen we had the girls stripped to show an excuse that they are in physical or psychological torture, girl gets sexually abused by step Dad, girl gets horribly experimented on scientists through torture to advance technology etc. In Brynhildr&#039;s mind, we had to throw Boob Jokes, Forced Bath Scenes, and girl wants to sleep with guy naked but no hentai. Because, harem, as this show is trying to make us sympathize from the harsh lives of the characters? Or trying to turn us on? Oh, wait, its both. (doesn&#039;t mix well btw)<br />
<br />
At least our Harem lead in Elfen (though very generic) seems to be an incredibly kind person, nor he is the brightest or the most cunning; he&#039;s just this vanilla guy that all chicks are forced to live. The Murakami dude is a douche! He apparently seems to appear very smart and has well thought out plans but turns out that he&#039;s entire thought process was completely retarded as almost every plan fails, it feels as if he&#039;s actually getting dum! He also makes boob jokes and trying to always tries to look smarter than everyone else for every chance he gets. He is at first, calm, sophisticated and intellectual, but turns out to be rather pretentious. The first opening was good, having some refreshing dubstep, but then I listen to ear rape like ten episodes in which was completely unnecessary for a 12 episode series! Aesthetically, its just some action and nothing special. <br />
<br />
VERDICT:<br />
In a nutshell its just plain stupid logic... Unlike its older sister which had a decent amount of depth and respect towards audience, Brynhildr is STUPID, all the way through. <br />
<br />
SCORES:<br />
6/10 Nothing special at all... It gets the job done in an above average manner.<br />
5/10 Completely forgettable OST except for the 2 openings which saves me for giving it a minus point.<br />
2/10 For super stupid characters!<br />
2/10 By via forced storytelling.<br />
1.5/10 With absolutely no redeeming factor except for the slightest deviants...<br />
<br />
2/10 For the obvious reasons!

    tl;dr: Garbage story, so bad its like how you can&#039;t help but watch a trainwreck. Only reason to watch this show is if you like harem anime since the characters are awfully designed, but still very interesting and entertaining to watch.<br />
<br />
This show&#039;s story is one of the worst things I&#039;ve ever seen. So many plotholes, illogical decisions, and unreasonable situations even if there&#039;s people with superpowers involved. Most of the series is spent on fanservice rather than the plot so at this point, I might as well rate it as a harem and just ignore the story they seem to pretty much ignore for a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review148933">
        large portion of the show. It doesn&#039;t help that the overall plot they&#039;re trying to tell is convoluted as all hell with more twists than an M. Night Shyamalan movie. It eventually becomes so bad, you want to see how much worse they can make it.<br />
<br />
The art and animation are pretty good, consistent with about what you&#039;d expect from a good anime, which, with this show&#039;s plot, is actually amazing in comparison. There&#039;s no spectacular CGI or 60 FPS animation or anything of that sort, its just the regular stuff done well.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t even recall if there were any pieces playing other than the OP and ED. The ED was relatively generic so I chose to ignore it. The first OP was kinda of good, at least it was interesting since most anime have lyrics and not pseudo-dubstep for their OPs. The second OP, which started like 8 or 9 episodes into the series for some reason, literally assaulted me, that&#039;s all I have to say about it.<br />
<br />
Honestly if you look at this show as a harem and not a show with any sort of meaning or story what so ever, it becomes rather enjoyable as the characters are rather well designed and one character in particular has a very unique and, uh, &quot;passionate&quot; personality that is probably the only reason I&#039;m still watching this show. The MC is oblivious as all hell like in most harems but at least he has a favorite and can make a choice, thank god.<br />

    &quot;Elfen Lied comparison complaint, grumble grumble, fanservice, grumble grumble, I&#039;d pardon this if it was cool like Shingeki no Kyojin but it&#039;s not, grumble, I&#039;m so much smarter than the Sci-Fi genre.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gokukoku no Brynhildr is exactly what you expected it was; An action-based thriller prematurely adapted from a manga by the same person who wrote Elfen Lied. So why are you so upset? The characters are static and flat, plot threads that should have been wrapped up quickly continue onto the last few episodes, and the art seems almost barbaric when comparing it to more visually stunning shows that aired simultaneously. It has the trope

          <span style="display: none;" id="review157267">
        of harem where it doesn&#039;t necessarily need one, there&#039;s a significant amount of ecchi scenes that seem awkwardly jumbled into the rest of the series, and all the women are literally helpless without the main character. Yes, the show is sexist and strives to enthuse the male audience. The only person I have to blame for this one is you. This is exactly what you asked for.<br />
<br />
Without all the sex and violence that sells Blu-Rays and DVDs, this anime wouldn&#039;t be a blip on any consumer&#039;s radar. There&#039;s nothing to separate Shingeki no Kyojin and this anime. The writing is about the same, leading the viewer on with very obvious plot threads only to confirm them true after 12 episodes of meandering. There&#039;s intense gore at the expense of our poorly-fleshed out cast, and the hyperviolence depicted in this series only continues to prove Elfen Lied&#039;s point that it so desperately tried to make ten years ago. People want to be shocked. They want to watch something that leaves them agape. This show lets people watch something dark and primal. It&#039;s the closest thing to sweet sweet revenge like Lucy got in response to her dog &quot;prank&quot; in Elfen Lied. And it&#039;s just winking enough to let the viewers be okay with it. The only thing Brynhildr is missing is the top notch visuals. If Brynhildr had the budget Shingeki no Kyojin did, it could be what SnK is right now - unquestioningly popular.<br />
<br />
Gokukoku no Brynhildr is endlessly entertaining. It&#039;s edgy and brooding in all the comical senses of the words. People don&#039;t just die in Brynhildr, their bodies bleed to death, then melt to oblivion, and then an alien carcass crawls out of them only to be squashed like a pesky bug. It&#039;s absurd! The show borrows all sorts of Sci-Fi concepts for it&#039;s main heroines, from predicting the future, to body swaps, to cybernetic transformation and secret underground facility conspiracies, and never ever apologizes about it. That might be why I&#039;m so partial to Brynhildr. It&#039;s swaggering and confident. It&#039;s never pretentious and always is self-aware. In fact, when explaining to the main character why the main female lead has superhuman strength she simply tells him, because of &quot;surgery and drugs.&quot; That&#039;s all I really needed. The script is justifiably quip.<br />
<br />
Brynhildr is the hyperviolent, misanthropic, edgy grimdark show you want to hate yet the writing works in such a way that you feel slightly optimistic for the cast, for the show, and for the world. Brynhildr isn&#039;t new, and as many critics have ingeniously surmised, it&#039;s incredibly close to Elfen Lied. Yet there&#039;s an X factor in Brynhildr, and that X factor is that small bit of hope, that at the end of the tunnel there&#039;s happiness for these characters that seem to repeatedly have the deck stacked up against them. You can tell this show is unforgiving walking into it and characters will suffer. You just want to know which ones. You hope and hope that something happens so that they&#039;re ALL spared, and can have a normal school life. Your favorite parts of the episode are probably when the ecchi things happen, giving you a moment of relief - an aside from all the death talk and inevitable decay of the cute girls on screen.<br />
<br />
And that is what this show is about. It dangles it&#039;s serene and oversexed nymphs in front of you like a worm to a fish, and you&#039;re on the hook. It pulls the misanthropic bait away and you&#039;re left in the dark ocean again to witness the murder, the decaying flesh, the real teen angst of it all. And you&#039;re mad again. You hate the ecchi scenes! You hate the dark edginess! You hate the whole goddamn thing and there&#039;s nothing to like about this show at all! But there is and you keep coming back. You just hope that these misfits on screen achieve some sort of rational happiness. And whether they do or not doesn&#039;t matter in the end, I guess, but as long as you&#039;re watching think about that. Think about why you&#039;re appalled or entertained and how this show treads that thin line.<br />
<br />
If you hated it all, good. You&#039;re a good person. If you liked it all, why? Are you a bad person?<br />
<br />
And, ahem, did you like Shingeki no Kyojin?

    Before I continue this review, I&#039;d like to point out the fact that I have, indeed, read the manga up to the point at which the story in the anime ended, and I will try my best not to compare the two, though it is near impossible, considering how much better it could have been with a true-to-the-manga following, instead of the anime original ending we have at hand.<br />
<br />
First, let me go into some brief background. Gokukoku no Brynhildr, better known as Kiwaguro no Brynhildr, which is the name of the manga series that served as the source material the anime was based on, was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review150775">
        written by the same author who wrote Elfen Lied. As a result, many people can see how similar the concepts that are used, as well as the character archetypes that are expressed in the two series&#039;s. Elfen Lied suffered from a terribly executed anime original ending, and whereas Gokukoku no Brynhildr should have learned from this original mishap, it suffers from a arguably worse anime original ending than Elfen Lied did, and coupled with the numerous other defects present in its almost jokingly terrible plotline and execution, it deserves a much lower score than its predecessor and accomplished much less.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s move onto the categories.<br />
<br />
Story: 3<br />
Let&#039;s begin with an analysis of the plotline. The main character, Murakami-kun, is a genius with photographic memory, and comes upon a &quot;witch&quot; that resembles his childhood friend, and he chooses to save this witch from persecution from the laboratory from which they escaped, along with multiple other witches. The backstory isn&#039;t bad, and is actually fairly interesting. It makes you question: What is the mystery of the lab that we are about to find out, and how is it related to why these witches are being persecuted?<br />
<br />
However, with further delving into the events that happen during the plot, you find that Brynhildr only devolves into a pseudo slice of life with gore in it, during which the only interesting things that happen include listening to Kazumi&#039;s heavily accented voice and her proclamations of how horny she is and how much she wants to have Ryota&#039;s children.<br />
<br />
The ending was another giant factor that becomes the downfall of this anime series - after dillydallying in the world of Kotori-chan&#039;s breasts and Kazumi&#039;s nonexistant ones for numerous episodes while providing minimal main plot development, the series tries to wrap itself up in the final 2 and a half episodes, cramming about 30 chapters of work into roughly an hour of showtime. As a result, the ending was inevitably rushed, and changed from the original manga arc&#039;s ending, cutting away important developments, like Ryota&#039;s presence right beside Kotori as she was ejected, or Kana&#039;s part in saving Neko and Ryota from Valkyria.<br />
<br />
Another blaring issue that the storyline had was the completely forced and manufactured plot. Rather than letting events unfold, and letting characters deal with problems as they normally would in an intelligent way, a tragedy happens, a character gets godlike status, and the problem is solved. This same formula is repeated numerous times throughout the episode, with deus ex machinas being pulled again and again and again from the writer&#039;s toolbox. I admit, this isn&#039;t just an issue with the anime adaptation, the manga suffered from it as well, whether it be Ryota&#039;s unerasable photographic memory, or Kotori&#039;s ability to stop all kinetic energy of the person she switches with when she switches places with someone using her teleportation ability. These scenes, however, show how stupid and contrived the plot actually is, which makes any plot progression feel forced and unrealistic, along with just plain uninteresting, because the audience can just assume that some character will exhibit some extreme new aspect of their power that will be able to easily solve any problem thrust in the main character&#039;s way, time and time again.<br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
The art was decent. The version I saw incorporated censoring in the form of fog in all the gory scenes (like the melting scenes or cut up bodies), that was almost as terrible as the Funimation censoring used for Freezing, but most other elements were handled fairly well. Certain scenes did feel awkward, however, and the characters did appear bland and uninteresting at times when actual plot development happened, leading me to believe most of the budget was spent on the unnecessary fanservice present throughout the entire length of the series.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5<br />
The sound quality was decent, and the opening sequence for the first 10 or so episodes was actually quite catchy, as dubstep openings aren&#039;t as prevalent in the Japanese music industry in general. The second opening, with its more heavy metal air, was also fairly interesting, and the ending provided a sense of calm after the gory events that happened in the episode. There wasn&#039;t anything particularly special about the OST- it was basically what you would expect from any other science fiction anime title with explosions and laser beams. The voice acting, however, was fairly subpar - none of the emotions that the characters felt that should have been communicated to the audience got through, and at times when some screaming and emotion should have been prevalent, the screaming and name-calling just felt noisy, and might have been better off with just silence and streaming tears. As a direct reference to one of these scenes, when Murakami was sliced in two in episode 12, Kana&#039;s fervent typing (which translates to speech through her superintelligent text to speech converter device) didn&#039;t serve much purpose, and actually distracted (and annoyed) me from a supposedly shocking scene.<br />
<br />
Character: 2<br />
The worst portion of the anime. Unique and interesting characters drive the plot of the anime, and without these, the plot simply can&#039;t function to be anything intellectual or even seemingly interesting. Every single character written in the series only had one of two purposes. 1. To be part of Ryota&#039;s harem or 2. To be killed brutally and horribly. All those who were part of the harem cannot act, or think for themselves - they are merely piles of meat that idolize Ryota and dream of mating with him - as literally and clearly expressed by Kazumi multiple times throughout the series&#039;s length. All those who die, end up as terrible emotional triggers that are supposed to attract the gore fetishists, or pull at the heartstrings of the sensitive - neither of which is possible with the terrible censoring and insignificance of any individual character that appears to die in the show.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3<br />
No doubt, my interest in the manga, and the failed expectations I had for the show before I entered it influenced my enjoyment levels, but nonetheless, if you don&#039;t enjoy random fan pandering and cardboard characters in your serious piece of science fiction with a dark plot and atmosphere, then you probably won&#039;t enjoy this show. <br />
<br />
Overall: 3<br />
This show suffers from the same problem that Elfen Lied did, except it doesn&#039;t solve this problem - it only makes it worse, in the worst way. All the calm and peaceful slice of life that happened in the show, much like the slice of life present in Elfen Lied, serves little to no purpose, and none of the characters are likable enough to feel emotion for when he or she happens to be caught up in tragedy. The show tried to juxtapose the gory and dark elements of the show&#039;s main plot, with the lighter elements of the show, but it was a doomed project from the beginning, and would have been much better off holding the male hormone tease and spending more time with the main storyline and illustrating all the mystery aspects it promises to address in the first episode, up till the last. At least with Elfen Lied, there was a sense of &quot;oh, wow, that was an intense ending, left open for us to wonder at and reflect on our own what the show was supposed to represent.&quot; With Gokukoku no Brynhildr, the only thought I&#039;m left with is &quot;What the heck happened I don&#039;t even know what I&#039;m supposed to be feeling Can somebody take me to the doctor please The manga was 1000% better even though I didn&#039;t even like the manga that much please Brynhildr what happened to Kazumi you didn&#039;t even tell me at the end Why did Neko have to lose her memories Why is Ryota so unkillable and such a badass and Why did I even choose to watch this adaptation.&quot;

     God, this anime, THIS ANIME.<br />
<br />
To put it bluntly, it doesn&#039;t know what it wants to be.<br />
<br />
It tries to deliver a serious and interesting story while, and I have yet to understand why the people behind this did this, having your occassional fan service/sexual inuendo thrown in between scenes that are supposed to tell you that shit&#039;s serious and lives are on the line.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s just unappropriate, it just doesn&#039;t fit, I can&#039;t get emotional attached to girls telling the main character that they&#039;re gonna die when they&#039;re all wearing bikinis and one&#039;s even constantly brabbling about how she wants to fuck the mc, just like...

          <span style="display: none;" id="review167565">
        what....<br />
<br />
I mean yeah, thanks for the boners and all that but, did you really have to do this?<br />
I expected a mature, dark themed story...<br />
<br />
What I got was, magic, tits, literally melting girls, breasts, &quot;indirect kisses&quot; boo hoo, love triangles and tits... <br />
<br />
Did I mention the beach episode? She loses her bikini top, which is somewhat of a repeating pattern in this anime, you&#039;ll often see girls topless, accidental breast grabbing and all that. yeah.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t even want to mention the ending, it was like &quot;Yes, finaly, she remembers!&quot; and then &quot;Well, who are you again?&quot;. DESTROYED, the only feel that was felt during the whole thing, DESTROYED<br />
<br />
All in all 3/10, all my why&#039;s and what&#039;s.

    Huge disappointment, possibly the biggest of the year. <br />
<br />
I&#039;d previously written a more positive review of this one as I was about 6 episodes in. Even then I&#039;d seen troubling signs that it could turn out terrible, but I thought it could fix itself before the problems grew to become excruciating. It took a 100% dive.<br />
<br />
The first episode leads off nicely, and the second one stirs up even more suspense and seems to get some character progression going. <br />
From here it seems to really lose all direction. <br />
There are some nice elements setting up for alot of possibilities but it&#039;s like the writer didn&#039;t know

          <span style="display: none;" id="review143363">
        what to do with it or realized the plot wouldn&#039;t be able to fit in just 13 episodes.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s actually not easy to point out exactly where we run off track with the story and the story just ends up following the characters&#039; random ways of life. Characters which are stereotypes to the core, and the main character comes off as this pretentious image that the writer tries to glorify themself in. The only real character traits you can say he has, are that he&#039;s got photographic memory and he just wants to selflessly protect and save these girls. A forced white knight protagonist, devoid of any shade of identity. Oh, and important to mention, is that all his crying moments are so cringeworthy, your toe nails could dive into your skin and grow out in-between your teeth. These characters and especially the protagonist are so painfully pretentious and one-dimensional.<br />
<br />
The girls... Besides that they&#039;re obvious stereotypes, the real offender is their interaction with eachother, and namely while the protagonist is in the room.<br />
I&#039;d tell you to pay attention to the way they talk, and notice how it feels like looking at otaku&#039;s in a small chat trying to establish themselves as these stereotypes IRL. <br />
&quot;I think I&#039;m more like X character, &#039;cause in my mind, my daily life just like that. I&#039;m totally like this character. That is until I watch another anime and think I&#039;m like Y character in that one.&quot;<br />
Basically everyone goes; &quot;I can out-otaku you any day&quot;.<br />
<br />
I do kinda still commend it for at two instances breaking an old and grating tease so often seen in anime... But then again, in hindsight, that might also just be to please the writer&#039;s ego.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a shame, &#039;cause it actually led off with an interesting start but it just became more like a bad fan fic. <br />
Watching it, I so often feel like I&#039;m actually just looking at the writer masturbate profusely while spouting their self-proclaimed excellence. <br />
And what supports this, is the fact that this short anime has two openings, with the second one feeling very rushed and ill fitting. It&#039;s really crammed in with the last episodes.<br />
<br />
The best thing about this anime is the first opening theme, which is quite interesting. It also feels like this was written, inspired by said theme. Especially with the soundtrack within the show seeming to rip it off.<br />
And talk about ripping off... The first opening sequence really feels like it&#039;s taking alot from Mirai Nikki, and the main &#039;love interest&#039; of the show, is really by design just a blue haired Makise from Steins;Gate, in an outfit that looks like it&#039;s borrow from Homura from Puella Magi. But it might just be me imagining things.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s really not much good to point out in this one. You can safely skip it.
