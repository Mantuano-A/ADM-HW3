    A Nyan Koi rip-off? Not really. For those who have read the synopsis and went on that basis, let me stop you there. While the similarities of cat-allergies are familiar to each anime, that&#039;s pretty much it that each tale will share.<br />
<br />
After episode 1, I was actually surprised to want to watch the next episode due to how close the show stuck to the manga&#039;s storyline. With a long line of let-downs in the last year for adaptations, I had made sure not too have to much of an expectation for this show, and I&#039;m glad I did as its proven to be just above

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22914">
        what I had hoped for.<br />
<br />
Without going into detail, Omamori Himari is the story of Amakawa Yuuto, descendant to a long line of demon slayers, and his kick-ass sexy feline guardian Himari Noihara(demon neko-mimi or cute puss-in-boots for you westerners). Add in a &#039;tsundere&#039; childhood friend, a loli, a maid waitress, and an  &#039;ojou-sama&#039; like fiancee and you have the rest of Yuuto&#039;s &quot;cliched harem&quot; as they try to handle co-existence with youkai(demons) and humans alike due to Yuuto being casted as one of those  sensitive new age guy who doesn&#039;t like violence(the type of nose-bleeding harem male you love to hate) <br />
<br />
Now this show falls in the genres of Action, Comedy, Demons,  Romance, Harem, Supernatural....which sound like ingredients to a great plot and story, but coming from a creator who&#039;s previous works are hentai, what you will see is fan-service, cliches, fan-service, loli-action, fan-service and a lot of ecchi(as a male I have no problem with that....oh and did I mention fan-service?)...well I guess the benefits of a H-mangaka is that you can expect the artwork to be top-notch. From the 3 sizes(of each heroine) to Yuuto making out with a few of the leading ladies, they&#039;ve made sure to cover the right angle shots in detail(which some will find very ero-ero....if you can get past the censorship that is...hopefully there&#039;ll be none of that when DVD gets released).<br />
<br />
The OP and ED are ok but not something to start looking out for on your next karaoke session and the BGM can be classed as elevator music(well not as bad). As for the voice actors, you have a great line up of seiyuus(Tenma from School Rumble being Himari as an example, and the cute Kuro from Kodomo no Jikan as Shizuku for those loli-lovers ^nano). The only thing I wasn&#039;t pleased with is Yuuto&#039;s VA, which I feel they&#039;ve miscasted. Those who&#039;ve seen School Days should know what I mean. Everytime I hear Yuuto&#039;s voice whilst Himari&#039;s trying to flirt with him, I get that spine-cringing feeling that someones out of place. I do feel sorry for that seiyuu as its not his fault for being the VA to Makoto(probably the most hated male lead in all of harem time), but he just does not suit being a harem lead. <br />
<br />
All-in-all without discriminating the show from the seiyuu, Omamori Himari is a worthwhile anime to watch. From the producers ZEXCS(who gave us Regios, Rental Magica and *vomit* Da Capo), here&#039;s hoping they don&#039;t stuff this one and give us a bad ending, or in Makoto&#039;s term a &quot;nice boat&quot;....<br />
<br />
If your looking for Nyan Koi replacement, I&#039;ll advice you now your not going to get it. As long as you don&#039;t come with no expectations, I can safely vouch that this anime will aim to please

    Yet another ecchi show aired this  year proves that trivial things like plot or characters&#039; depth might end solely as a bonus to the brainless fanservice. And I wouldn&#039;t mind that!<br />
<br />
Omamori Himari, though, was one of the worst and least enjoyable anime shows I&#039;ve watched lately.<br />
<br />
Again, normally, I wouldn&#039;t mind fanservice&gt;everything else design, as long as it&#039;s at least decent. This anime, though rated R+ lacked it at all!<br />
It&#039;s not like I&#039;m watching the show solely of the fanservice purposes, but this one has literally nothing else to offer.<br />
<br />
Art isn&#039;t horrible, but mediocre at it&#039;s best.<br />
Characters&#039; design is tedious  and ordinary. Backgrounds are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25755">
        boring and dull-looking. Overally bland.<br />
<br />
Sound doesn&#039;t highlight much. Music is that typical that it hurts. Not interesting at all.<br />
<br />
Plot lacks plot, mostly slice-of-life except few episodes. Dialogues are dull, usually too long and boring. Characters are shallow, lackluster and stereotypical.<br />
Overally very predictable and beat.<br />
<br />
In general anime is bad and very tiresome. I don&#039;t suggest watching unless you expect nothing or get entertained very, very easily by boring stuff.

    I suppose the easiest way to sum up what I&#039;ve seen so far are these two words: Uninspired and dull.<br />
<br />
Everything you can see in this anime has been done multiple times before in so many better series, so if your after originality then you shouldn&#039;t bother watching this.<br />
<br />
The good thing about Omamori Himari is the fact that it will appeal to most fetishes out there: Lolicon, maids, cat-girls and what-not. Buts that probably the shows only redeaming feature, and even then its only good if your into that kind of thing.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m quite glad theres only a week left of this as there really hasn&#039;t been

          <span style="display: none;" id="review24135">
        any building up to a finale, everything just feels like another episode rather than something meaningful.<br />
<br />
To sum this up; If you like having boobs and panty shots thrown at you then you&#039;ll probably like this, though if you want something with a bit of depth or action that is actually good then I&#039;d advise to stay away from this.

    Omamori Himari<br />
This anime was my first Ecchi/Harem anime and it was very good...<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The story is about this young boy named Yuuto that has a normal life and is allergic to cats, one day he trips with this girl called Himari then he finds out she is a cat/girl and is allergic when she gets close to him, but there&#039;s something he doesn&#039;t remember and that is she is his protector and gives him an Omamori (amulet) that keeps the enemies away from hurting him, he will meet a lot of girls that will care for him and they want to be with him, they will

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195052">
        help him to retrieve back his memory to know what he should do. The story is good.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation<br />
The animation was very good, it&#039;s an ecchi after all, it has to be, there were irregularities sometimes but i thought it was very good.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The sound overall was good, the VA was good too and the music background was ok, the OP and ED were ok.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
There&#039;s a lot of characters to see here, all of them well developed, your typical harem where there are a lot of girls with big boobs or naive girls or the ones that falls for the MC with his back story but this was very good because of the bunch of boobs and babes there are.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
Being my first Ecchi/Harem i enjoyed more this anime because of those elements and the action scenes were good and boobs of course.

Story: 1/10<br />
I&#039;m not the biggest harem or fanservice fan, but I don&#039;t mind if they have a good story and likeable characters. But instead of a good plot with fanservice, it&#039;s fanservice with little plot. <br />
I knew all hope was lost when the generic fanservice beach episode was the second one. Then episode 3 was written around fanservice. &#039;How can we make Himari&#039;s breasts/panties show this time?&quot;. I wanted to give it a chance, it sounded interesting and for the most part ecchi doesn&#039;t bother me. I mean series like 11 eyes, for example, find ways to write fanservice into a scene, but in this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35767">
        series, they try to write a scene around fanservice. It&#039;s pointless! And the thing is, it even has potential to be a good story! Demon slayers, demons, magic powers etc. Sounds like it could be a good fantasy story, but alas no. They might as well have taken the clothes out completely and made it a hentai. And I&#039;ve seen hentai with more story.. <br />
There are maybe 3 episodes out of 12 that relate to the &quot;plot&quot;. <br />
<br />
Character: 3/10<br />
All of the villains tend to be large breasted females who also lust over the main character (and for what reason I don&#039;t know). The main male character barely looks a day over 12, yet is getting fondled and dry humped by a lot of women who look many years older than him (except one, who looks like an elementary school kid. She heals him by rubbing against him until she gets off). Of course he has his cliche annoying possessive female friend, and the the large busted bodyguard. However, I actually like Himari. She&#039;s pretty well rounded (and not just her chest). She&#039;s also a powerful cat demon that fights with a sword- what&#039;s not to like? She also shows the widest range of emotion. Really she&#039;s the only character worth mentioning.  <br />
<br />
Overall, unless you watch an anime for just breasts and pantyshots and no story, this is not one I&#039;d recommend. <br />

    Ecchi and harem, they go hand in hand in the anime industry and are two of the most popular genres within the otaku culture, but this is widely known, so the question is: Does this anime have anything else to offer other than fan-service? <br />
<br />
It&#039;s answer is: No, while it does have a plot and has some action mixed into it, this kind of a story could be from a kid&#039;s dream for all I know.<br />
<br />
So after stating that this has no story where does this enjoyment come from, the fan-service obviously, while plot wise it is bad, the way it introduces characters and creates

          <span style="display: none;" id="review69441">
        for the situations it has, it does relatively good. The &quot;plot&quot; revolves around a guy named Amakawa Yuuto, who is your ordinary high school student, nothing more than that, he has his caretaker (a tsundere) wake him up and tend to him for most of the time. Until one day he wakes up with a cat in his face (a catgirl, childhood friend) and they start out their adventures from that point.<br />
<br />
But a story with only fan-service in it has no chance of getting an anime, so they added action/magic theme to it, which is fine in terms of content, we get to see a variety of magic they creator thought of when he added powers to his characters, the action itself is actually a bit good, they have some good fights which aren&#039;t only for the sake of fan-service. <br />
<br />
Lastly in the story, I would like to address the episodes and their content, while it has a bad plot and no real character background, it doesn&#039;t have the cliché episodes and has some episodes with original stuff happening in them. <br />
<br />
Art-wise it is good, like surprisingly good, the boob physics are used without holding back and the characters look colourful and vivid.<br />
<br />
Sound-wise, it is decent, nothing amazing or outstanding which piqued my interest, seiyuu wise, most of them you can probably recognise and if not, you will later as they play lots of roles in different anime.<br />
<br />
Now to add up on that tsundere and catgirl, childhood friend stereotype, we can add: a loli kuudere, clumsy maid and childhood friend 2. By summing all these up you can come to the conclusion that every cliché harem character is present, although I do say that, some of them have their own variations from their archetype, but honestly, most of them are textbook cliché characters.<br />
<br />
Overall I though Omamori Himari was quite a weak anime, but there is worse out there, a lot worse, it made up for its no-plot with decently good fights and the fan-service was not half bad.<br />
<br />
Strong points:<br />
- Fan service has some nice variety to it.<br />
- The episodes have some decent content in them.<br />
- The fights in the anime are good, cliché and overused, but entertaining.<br />
<br />
Weak points:<br />
- Textbook characters. Including the weak protagonist.<br />
- Weak plot, which doesn&#039;t get any expansion on in the anime.<br />
- Nothing special about its sound part.<br />
<br />
So if you are looking for a classic harem ecchi with some decent fights and episodes (in terms of content) and don&#039;t mind the weak characters, then Omamori Himari is the anime for you.

    Another RTLR coming right for your eyes! This time we&#039;re dealing with a show that just basically hits the checkboxes for the harem/echhi/supernatural lists, and skips away, happy in it&#039;s ability to be perfectly average. The short of it is there is some amusement to be had here, but it&#039;s very vanilla. Not a waste of time, but there are other series that do all those thing with much more vigor. Will the RTLR wall of allergies get modified? Or is Emma Frost&#039;s position still secure? Let&#039;s drop it like its hot!<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
As I said, this is very much your average harem show. The main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309631">
        character (MC) possesses a very powerful technique that the demons fear and that the other slayer families wish to have. This power is not one he can use of free will, of course, and only activates in extremely dangerous situations. He is also a pacifist, believing demons and people can live together side by side, like some kind of hippie supernatural hangout. He only strikes enough to defend himself, and always keeps his harem on shorts leashes to make sure they don&#039;t kill either. We&#039;ve seen this kind of character in tons of other shows, the happy go lucky guy that wants peace above all other things. <br />
<br />
As he and his initial cat demon girl and his human best friend encounter new foes and defeat them, they pretty much always end up becoming new members of the harem. They all give some variation on &#039;his soul is pure, I must study his ways&#039; or something similar. As the flock grows, a few of the girls hit on the MC, but the primary romantic rivalry is between the cat girl and the human girl. This is where a lot of the ecchi moments come in, with cat girl doing everything in her power to breed with the MC, and the human friend determined not to lose her best friend to the strange cat girl demon. The other girls seem interested as well, but no one gets in to each of their ways until another girl comes along and claims to be the MC&#039;s betrothed. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s lots of moments where the cat demon shoves the MC&#039;s head between her enormous breasts, and he even up accidentally kissing the cat girl, blowing her mind and her lust sky high. The human friend sometimes attempts to keep up with the cat girl&#039;s outrageous behaviors. For example in one scene, the cat girl removes her top and exposes her breasts. The human girl freaks out, and then begins to remove her clothes as well. She&#039;s stopped before finishing the job, but the jealousy is readily apparent there. Oh, as a note, this is ecchi, but no nipples are ever shown onscreen that I can remember. It&#039;s all implied and innuendo and such. A lot of it revolves around jokes, where the MC and another person fall down and end up in an embarrassing position, with body parts in improper places and the light. It&#039;s not even as overblown as in, say, Highschool DxD where the characters put out their naughty bits intentionally and freak out the main character. This is more slapstick like, for the most part. Another old standby of the harem ecchi genre. <br />
<br />
Another slightly varied, but still cliche&#039;d feature is that of a single character possessing a great deal of power, but being unable to fully use it for fear of losing control. DxD had it in the red dragon armor Issei had, and Sister New Devil had that white armor that made him risk becoming berserk. In Omamori, its the cat girl who is the one unable to completely unleash her powers because when she does, she attacks everyone she sees, driven by bloodlust, making it dangerous for any allies to be around her. So she often moves alone against the enemy, thinking she&#039;ll use her full power to win before the MC and the rest of the harem arrive. This is pretty much always met with disastrous results. Only by fighting at the MC&#039;s side does she learn to truly do the best she can in battle and not lose her mind. The whole &#039;don&#039;t go full powered or it&#039;ll consume you!&#039; is yet another trope many of these kinds of anime pull. <br />
<br />
The ending doesn&#039;t give us anything new except a huge fight, and of course the MC gains the ability to use his superpower at will if only for a moment. The warriors for the hero find the true enemy had hasn&#039;t been engaging in the fighting, and finally slay him, freeing the &#039;face&#039; of the true enemy (who is of course a female demon) the option to &#039;see the light&#039; and join the harem if she pleases. Does she? I think we can all answer that question right now just off the info I&#039;ve presented so far. And our ending has everything going right back to normal, only with the harem being even bigger now. The MC proves that demons and humans really can live together peacefully and all&#039;s well that ends well. Never seen that ending before, have you? <br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
I thought the art looked pretty good. Of course they work hard for the ecchi elements, lots of bouncing tits and lots of panty shots, but they also work those into action shots and that to me makes the art and animation look a little smoother than some titles. Hard to slip in the panty shots over and over in the middle of fights if you&#039;re skimping on actual fight frames. No complaints from me, except that good art cannot save terribly average storytelling. <br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
The voices all sound fairly well. I didn&#039;t like the MC&#039;s voice much, though. The girls all sound fairly good, and have their own tweaks. The loli girl continually says &#039;nano&#039; (you know I think is a rough translation) after damn near everything she says which can get a little old, but is used to humorous effects on occasion. The tea cup demon girl is a little high pitched at times, and nearly a little overdone. The other demon slayer sounds dead right in her arrogance, and the cat girl has a mature and sexy sound to her voice. <br />
<br />
The background music was acceptable, and a bit funny at times. They have that &#039;midway&#039; point in the show, like where in broadcast they would have cut to commercial, the first &#039;side&#039; of this shot shows a girl, or sometimes two, in an outfit. When the &#039;second&#039; side appears, a sultry sax phrase is played, and much of the model&#039;s clothes are missing. Hearing that sexy sounding sax play was kind of funny, calling back to the days of old, cheesy pornos. <br />
<br />
The themes are fun, and while they may not always match some of the more intensive episodes, they still do their job well. They are both tunes I have playing in my general anime music folder, and they are fun and light-hearted. The ending theme, &#039;Beam my Beam&#039; gets the lyrics shuffled around throughout the series, but is still &#039;bouncy&#039; enough to fit the ecchi theme the show presents. <br />
<br />
Character: 5<br />
The characters catch knocks because they are so predictable and cliche to the point of being pieced together from better shows. Of course the cat girl, the demon trying hardest to win the MC&#039;s affection is sexy, and prone to initiating naught behavior such as flashing her breasts or pulling the MC into her chest and things like that. She&#039;s of course also very powerful and dresses in traditional garb while wielding a katana. She reminds me a lot of Erika from Campione. She&#039;s also at odds with every other girl in the harem, similar to the initial rivalry between Rias and Asia in DxD. <br />
<br />
The human friend also mirrors that same rivalry, being not a demon and not having any powers. Asia started out not a demon and her only power is basically defensive, so there&#039;s some comparison to be had I believe. I guess if you have a next door neighbor for several years, especially of the opposite sex, I think you&#039;re like legally required to marry them or something. Sorry guys, but the law of anime must be upheld! <br />
<br />
The loli isn&#039;t really into the guy all that much, beside her initial &#039;I must learn about love!&#039; statement, which isn&#039;t that unusual. I am reminded of Yoshino from Date a Live here, in that she&#039;s around, she can help in a fight, but she&#039;s content to be close to the boy in question, and doesn&#039;t seem to lust after him the others do. <br />
<br />
The human supposed finace is of course very powerful, though she harbors a secret that causes her intense need to be with the MC. She&#039;s arrogant and believes that no one else could possibly compete with her for his affections, though she&#039;s secretly jealous inside over the cat girl. She&#039;s also by nature in diametric opposition to the harem&#039;s demon members, but to be close to the MC, she sets aside her duty to slay demons and stays with the group. This reminds me of the church exorcist Xenovia from DxD, or the &#039;hero village&#039; girls from Sister New Devil. She&#039;s also bossy and opinionated, always arrogant about her powers. Tropes everywhere! <br />
<br />
Don&#039;t forget the MC, who, like most of these shows, has amnesia regarding his past, the ability to use a very strong superpower, but only when needed and never at will, and of course he&#039;s a total pacifist, thinking all creatures should be allowed to live and not be preyed upon. He&#039;s also clumsy around girls, doesn&#039;t have the confidence to move on any urges he might have sexually, and is not even bothered by the near sexual harassment piled on top of him by the harem members. <br />
<br />
All these characters are cookie cutters and seem to be lifted from better shows. None of them show anything that is really remarkable nor does anything not totally predictable based on their personalities. They play off here and there for a laugh, and can sometimes be funny, but for the most part, they kind of end up boring more than anything. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6<br />
Yes, I did laugh a few times here and there, and a 6 is still better than bad, even though many people view a 6 like they do a 2. It&#039;s not a bad show, it&#039;s just formulaic, and doesn&#039;t have any real points in it that stick out above and beyond any other harem ecchi show out there. I actually had to watch the series twice, because I forgot so quickly about the series I couldn&#039;t even write on it without a second watch. It&#039;s forgettable, but not bad. There are much worse ways to pass the time, but there are many better ways to do so as well. <br />
<br />
Best Girl: Noihara Himari. The cat girl is cute, and is valiant enough in always trying to rush ahead and defeat the enemy before her master is ever in danger. At least she does&#039;t say &#039;nano&#039; every 3 seconds. <br />
<br />
In closing, I would say that this isn&#039;t a bad show, 6 is above board, but barely. There&#039;s a lot of elements in this show we&#039;ve seen before, and seen done better. If you don&#039;t mind the retreading of these tropes, then you&#039;ll likely have a good time here. If you want something more tangible with a unique hook or something you&#039;ve not seen before, then pass for sure. I guess for me the question is, is totally forgettable worse than bad? I&#039;m going to go with no, but I can see how some of you might say &#039;yes&#039;. Just another ecchi harem in a genre pack solid with them. Emma is safe on the RTLR wall for now. All thumbs sideways. <br />

    I remember when I first read the manga to this. I enjoyed every bit and the first signs that I would equally enjoy the anime appeared when I found myself smiling at the list of winter 2009 new releases.<br />
<br />
About just another high schooler living his life up until his demon repellent charm expires, making him vulnerable to demons, youkais, and monsters alike. Why are these demons after him? He&#039;s from a family of demon slayers and the rest goes along without much relevance to what&#039;s really important in the anime.<br />
<br />
We have the childhood friend, starting off at square one of this harem. Then a demon

          <span style="display: none;" id="review26199">
        cat guardian (Himari of course) appears to save him from his first demon attack. Shizuku gets dragged in after witnessing Yuuto&#039;s compassion for innocent demons. Lizlet sticks along after Yuuto &quot;saves her life&quot;. And another childhood friend, apparently long lost, a demon slayer like Yuuto and my favorite of them all Kuesu Junguji.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a harem anime, what&#039;s there to expect? Loads of boobage and underwear scenes of course. Being cat themed, we also get a bit of neko ears in the mix as well.<br />
<br />
The plot isn&#039;t that much important. I say the most interesting thing was Himari&#039;s quest to earn a mouth to mouth kiss with Yuuto with I enjoyed watching.<br />
<br />
Although I wish it would&#039;ve been longer and a bit more closer to the manga (for the benefit of the plot) I am very much satisfied with the 12 eps I received and hope with all my heart we get a little more content out of this.<br />
<br />
One thing that stuck out to me was the music. BEAM My BEAM (ED theme) was the best ending theme I&#039;ve heard in a long time. Possibly the best out of the winter 2009 - Spring 2010 anime EDs. Same for the OP as well. I loved all the songs.<br />
<br />
If I could wish for anything more of this anime. I would ask for Character albums with at least 2 songs for each character as well as a different version of the OP and ED themes.<br />
<br />
tl;dr: It&#039;s good, watch it before you start your next series in line.<br />
<br />

    When you first look at Omamori Himari, you may think that it is just like every other Harem anime out there.  Where Himari really pulls ahead and shows that this is a very different anime is but the way all of the characters interact with not only the main male lead Yuuto, but with the other girls that have come to follow him.  In most of your harem anime the first girl that you meet is most of the time your air head who just likes to do a couple things. In this anime they do not introduce the air head until later

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27497">
        in the anime and not as a critical character. The first two girls that you meet are one of Yuuto&#039;s childhood friend, Rinko and the cat demon Himari. Right there you have the smart friend who wants to help Yuuto as much as she can and the other is the always loyal bodyguard.<br />
	The story to Omamori Himari is not bad. The ending left it open for a second season, but they gave you enough to feel satisfied when it is over. Throughout the anime, the writer is always introducing new characters; some may play a bigger role and sometimes just the normal additions. They play a part that would be very different if they were not there. Between the voice and the characters, the producer of this anime did a good job. All of the voice actors fit the personality of the character that they were playing.<br />
	Give this anime a chance I know that it will make you want to keep watching until there are none left and all you can is watch it over and over again.<br />

    If you are looking for an anime with an extremely good story and a strong main male character, leave this very second, this anime has none of those things. If you like bouncing boobs and a hot main female &#039;exposing herself&#039; in front of our main male, then your in for a treat.<br />
<br />
Story:7<br />
The story wasn&#039;t bad compared to shows like Kanokon and some other shows that have completely no story and are episodic anime. Rosario to Vampire just barely pulled it off, so I was glad when this anime had an actual story. That doesn&#039;t mean they pulled it off perfectly. Guess they just plainly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review134117">
        should have had more experience. But it is still an enjoyable story.<br />
<br />
Art:10<br />
This art is simply amazing. Simply amazing. Blew me away as the great design and the immense detail immerse you in the storyline, at the very most making you want to be there. I see absolutely nothing wrong with the art and everything that I wanted was there, this includes the art of bouncing boobs, even THAT had good artwork.<br />
<br />
Sound:9<br />
I see nothing wrong but nothing outstanding about the sound quality of this anime. I guess since it&#039;s not dubbed it doesn&#039;t matter anyway.<br />
<br />
Characters:4<br />
Let me tell you something Ecchi-anime makers. WHY IS THE MAIN MALE ALWAYS SO WIMPY? This is what is wrong with pretty much every ecchi anime in existence, save for High School DxD, which in the novels states Issei is extremely strong. I would give this anime&#039;s character score a ZERO if it weren&#039;t for Himari and Kuesu. So many Lolis on this goddamn show, I think there is 3 or something.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:7<br />
This anime can still be enjoyed, even with that wimpy main male. It did leave me wanting to watch more and more, which is something that some anime don&#039;t really give at all. If you are new to ecchi anime altogether, you might wanna try this. <br />
<br />
Overall:7<br />
Overall, this anime is a great one to watch and I would reccoment it to everyone that fits the requirements of the first lines of this review.<br />
<br />
Thanks!!!

    Plain and simple: the artwor is well done, the voices matched characters to a point, and the plotline for this story, even if common, is still good. However, the charactersb are all pathetic. A character dictates how well a show is....the main character&#039;s motivation to do anything is weak. Clearly most of the characters fight for the sake of Amakawa, their reason being that they lik him and there are even reasons for why they like him, yet he is an inconsistency in the story....hehas no motivation to fight, even if he is kind his &quot;wimpy&quot; attitude to every situation is annoying and it takes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review55241">
        mountains to be crushed before he dos something useful if he even does anything at all. His character is supposed to be the base for all the other characters, yet reality would show most people would never follow a guy like that. The story could have progressed in a number of ways to make the show good, yet it took crappiest and did not live up to the potential. Overall...this show is no good unless you want senseless fanservice.

    How should I describe Omamori Himari in a way that does not downplay it&#039;s worth of your time? Well if you like your anime to consist of at least three pathetic main characters who do nothing but bitch about how weak they are then you&#039;ll be fine. Then about 1/2 of the time watching you will see nothing but tits, panties, and more tits. Which isn&#039;t that bad if your looking for just that. It also has a decent but half-assed story line for those of you who wish to seek a half-assed enjoyable tale. <br />
<br />
STORY: 6<br />
I&#039;ll be blunt. The story falls short of achieving

          <span style="display: none;" id="review55101">
        a memorable tale and exciting adventure. There wasn&#039;t so much a problem to where the story was going but to where it DIDN&#039;T GO. There were many questions left unanswered which only left me miffed. Like what concluded at the end. *SPOILER* Mɥʎ ʇɥǝ ɟnɔʞ ıs ┴ɐɯɐ ıu ⅄nnʇo,s ɥonsǝɥolp¿ ∀ɟʇǝɹ ɐll sɥǝ pıp ǝɐʇ ɐ sɥıʇ loɐp oɟ ɥǝɹ oʍu ʞıup ɟoɹ ɥǝɹ dǝɹsouɐl ƃɐıu˙ ∀up Hıɯɐɹı pıp qǝɐʇ ʇɥǝ lıʌıuƃ ɔɹɐd onʇ oɟ ɥǝɹ˙ I ʞuoʍ ſǝsns sɐʎs ɟoɹƃıʌǝuǝss ıs ɐ ʌıɹʇnǝ qnʇ ɔoɯǝ ou¡ Mɥɐʇ¿ ∀ɹǝ Hıɯɐɹı ɐup ⅄nnʇo ƃoıuƃ ʇo ʞǝǝd ɐ ɔɐuuıqɐlısʇıɔ uıuǝ-ʇɐıl ɟox ʍɥǝɹǝ ʇɥǝʎ slǝǝd¿ ∀lso ʍɥɐʇ ɥɐddǝuǝp ʇo ʇɥǝ ɯosʇ doʍǝɹɟnl ∀ʎɐʞɐsɥı¿ ∀ddɐɹǝuʇlʎ ʇɥǝɹǝ ɐɹǝ Ɛ oɟ ʇɥǝɯ˙ )┴ɐʎnʇɐɯɐ ɥɐs ʇɥǝ sɐɯǝ unɯqǝɹ˙ I ʍoupǝɹ ʍɥʎ¿( ┴ɥǝɹǝ,s ɾnsʇ so ɯnɔɥ ɔɹɐd ʇɥǝʎ lǝɟʇ onʇ ıʇ,s ǝuonƃɥ ʇo ɯɐʞǝ ɐ sǝɔoup sǝɐsou˙ Mıll ʇɥǝʎ¿ SHO∩˥p ʇɥǝʎ¿ I pou,ʇ ǝʌǝu ɔɐɹǝ ɐuʎɯoɹǝ ʎon pǝɔıpǝ ıɟ ʎon ʍɐuʇ ʇo ʍɐʇɔɥ ʇɥıs ɔɹɐd˙ ∀up ıɟ ʎon ɟlıddǝp ʎonɹ ɯouıʇoɹ ndsıpǝ poʍu ʇo ɹǝɐp ʇɥıs ʎonɹ ɹǝʇɐɹpǝp˙ *END OF SPOILER* (If you want to read the spoiler try Googling &quot;upside down text&quot;.)  Due to this glass being only half-way filled I found it quite similar to &quot;Tayutama: Kiss on My Deity&quot;. Both have this issue of incompletion and both have their main protagonists seeking coexistence. However, I find that &quot;Omamori Himari&quot; did execute its story a lot better than its counterpart Tayutama. But it still failed to succeed where Tayutama also failed. And that was its useless characters and the unsatisfactory ending. Where it could have easily continued through a 2nd season and hopefully redeem itself through a well thought out conclusion. While there were many ecchi moments and romantic endeavors occurring everywhere in the story frequently, there was also a good portion of action involved which was very much welcomed. It could have been more gruesome and violent as it had a few scenes which seemed to beg for a violent outcome but this anime was aiming more for an ecchi/romance audience. Again, it could have done much worse than what other anime&#039;s who are KNOWN for gruesome scenes have done, *cough* Elfen Lied *cough* but the way it handled its plot it seemed to lean more towards Otaku&#039;s who love to see a Tig Ol&#039; Bittied heroine.<br />
<br />
ART: 8<br />
I very much enjoyed the art of Omamori Himari. Not because I had a hard on most of the time since it showed so much tit and ass but because...OK so the tits and ass were drawn very erotically and nicely. To the point where I didn&#039;t care about the story anymore. All I cared about was &quot;Are they...are they going to show me the nipples now or do I have to go watch a hentai?&quot; <br />
<br />
SOUND: 9<br />
The music was OK and the sound of the characters fighting, arguing, etc is the same as any other anime and no different in anyway. TBH I don&#039;t even know why there is a sound section in reviews. Pretty much ALL anime&#039;s sound the same except for the voice actors, music, and special effects. And if the anime&#039;s do sound a bit off (or entirely) it probably is your speakers, download of the video, or streaming source.  They should just name this section &quot;Music&quot; or &quot;Actors&quot; IMO. Speaking of actors Bleach&#039;s Orihime is in here and so is the voice of Makoto (School Days) as the main protagonist. And if your familiar with the voice of Nymph from &quot;Heaven&#039;s Lost Property&quot; and Erio from &quot;Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko&quot; you&#039;ll probably :D. In addition to all of these underrated voice actresses/actors apparently Holo is our main heroine. <br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 6<br />
Hmm...don&#039;t know how to start this part out as the character list defines all of them almost perfectly. So I don&#039;t really see the point in addressing this part of the review. I guess I could only just review how they brought upon themselves the belief of them being an actual character that has worth in the show. You&#039;ve got:<br />
<br />
Himari: A VERY sexy feline Ayakashi who serves as the body guard of our main faggot obviously. She has real nice tits...and ass...and..FUCK! I&#039;ve paid too much attention to the fan-service that I practically forgot how she is. Let me see if I can remember...hmm....DAMN YOU FAN-SERVICE! <br />
<br />
Shizuku: Um...why does she remind me of Nozomu from Kanokon? (That anime was TERRIBLE by the way) <br />
<br />
Yuuto Amakawa: This guy is a FAGGOT and a PUSSY. (Not the feline kind) THAT IS ALL. <br />
<br />
Lizlet L &quot;Liz&quot; Chelsie: She basically is in the show purely for comedic relief and fan-service. Nothing about her is interesting...AT ALL...other than she&#039;s a fucking teacup lol. <br />
<br />
Kuesu Jinguuji: I didn&#039;t even give a shit about this bitch. OK MOVING ON! <br />
<br />
Rinko Kuzaki: This pathetic use of a script and character reminded me of Kazumi from Shakugan no Shana. (Who I deeply hate with a passion) You wanna know why? She&#039;s practically an EXACT REPLICA OF SAID BITCH. Almost everything about her (excluding her voice actress) is exactly like her! Especially her uselessness. I don&#039;t know why the developers even put her in the show. She just gets all pissed when Himari try&#039;s to get it on with the main faggot. (Just to let you know I shall refer to him as faggot as he is indeed a faggot) Everything else is just her trying to claim faggot as her own. And if you think I&#039;m wrong about her being a clone GTFO right now and watch SNS and then tell me she doesn&#039;t look and have the talent of being useless just like  Kazumi. <br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 6<br />
I did enjoy &quot;Omamori Himari&quot; I will not lie. It&#039;s got good ecchi moments if that&#039;s what your looking for but with a mix of some action and plot development as well. Although it wasted a lot of potential of being beyond a typical Action, Comedy, Demons, Ecchi, Romance, Harem, Supernatural anime it still manages to do just fine. Which suits its score perfectly. Its just a fine anime.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 6 <br />
 If you like tits but no nipples, ass but not so much as the tits, and some plot and action development in between, then &quot;Omamori Himari&quot; just might be for you. Otherwise steer clear of this ecchi fest. And if your pissed that I wasted your time then blame yourself faggot. Your the one that decided to read a review than to go watch the damn anime in question. And this is just my personal opinion. That&#039;s what reviews are for! To let the ass who wastes their times writing these reviews express their ideas and feelings about the thing in question. Go ahead...click that &quot;Not Helpful Button&quot; I DARE YOU.

    This is my first review about an anime<br />
<br />
Story 7/10<br />
A story about a guy named Amakawa Yuuto who wants to live a normal life, then a girl named Himari who is an Ayakashi and also a cat comes into his life. As the story keep going, more Ayakashi are introduced. The ending is too boring, and there are no romance at all<br />
<br />
Art 8/10<br />
The art is not a problem for me<br />
<br />
Sound 6/10<br />
The music is not so bad, but some of them are really annoying. The OP and ED are not too bad<br />
<br />
Character 4/10<br />
In my opinion, the most annoying one is Rinko. I admit that she&#039;s beautiful, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review130799">
        she is a normal human, and she should stay away from the Ayakashis because she is pathetic. This is probably the only part I hate from the story.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 5/10<br />
Seriously, this anime is too boring for me. I can&#039;t enjoy this anime to the fullest.<br />
<br />
Overall 6/10<br />
The producer are too concerned about the harem storyline. The actions are suck! Seriously, I know they can make a better one than this!

    I drew a wrong stick..so i have to review this..Damn it<br />
<br />
  So the story is about a boy from the 12 legendary demon hunter clans but he doesnt know it.A cat-woman(+1) gets to be his guardian and as the anime goes on this damn boy gets a harem..my god im jealous.This anime also has heavy fanservice(dont let your children watch it) so older people might enjoy(themeselves huehue).<br />
<br />
  Characters are mostly huge breasted..or at least big(except1) and the main character is the clicheic weak MC who grows stronger.<br />
<br />
  Sounds are pretty good so i wont pick on them..they were decent.<br />
  The art

          <span style="display: none;" id="review209447">
        was good...you know that i mean here.So i wont descrive it any further<br />
<br />
  I enjoyed it and i do recomed it if you can stand all the *ahems*...<br />
It wasnt that bad,it was quite decent and also has fight scenes(watching for the plot only..) so it is worth giving it a go.

    Omamori Himari was one of the first animes I&#039;d watched over my &quot;Summer Anime Marathon&quot; and I can say it was good. It wasn&#039;t a &quot;One of the Greatest Animes Ever&quot; anime, but it is worth watching if you&#039;re into the Echii/Harem stuff.<br />
<br />
Story wise... cat girl is sent to &quot;protect&quot; a childhood friend from demons that want to kill him. That&#039;s the main story right there. Along with some side stories added to it, it turned out pretty decent. For every couple episodes, new characters joined the show and the story got more interesting. Well done, although at points it seemed a little slow.<br />
<br />
Artwork, it&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review78980">
        your average anime made within a 3 year period. The art was clear and colorful, but it seemed fairly average for an anime, and it&#039;s not just the scenery, it goes for the characters too. I feel like I&#039;ve seen them before even watching the show, so they had common faces from other animes I&#039;ve watched. I&#039;m not complaining, the art went well with the show, but I would have liked to see a little more creativity.<br />
<br />
Sound was good, voice actors did their role well, and I&#039;m hoping that one day if this is dubbed the voice actors will do just as good. SFX were also well done, for the few battle sequences the show had, it was really impressive.<br />
<br />
Characters... like I said before, the artwork could have been a little more creative. And it&#039;s not just the artwork they could have added more creativity to, the character&#039;s personalities should have been more unique. Like ALL echii/harem animes I&#039;ve ever seen, there is always a silent character, a loli character, a strong/scary character, a character that is all lovey-dovey, etc. Even though these traits fit the characters, I would have liked to see something different for a change. I did like all the characters though, none of the characters turned out to be total jerks or annoying to me, which is interesting because there is almost ALWAYS at least one character in this kind of genre that gets on my nerves in every anime.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the most of it, had some good comedy, good action scenes, interesting plot, and a whole lot of fanservice... but most of it ties in with the comedy part of the show. Overall it was good. I wouldn&#039;t rewatch it over and over again, but I will rewatch it some day when I am in the mood for it. It&#039;s worth watching. <br />
<br />
Solid 7.

    The plot of the anime follows the manga for the first few episodes<br />
and then just goes to pieces on the last few episodes<br />
the artwork could definitely be better<br />
falls in the genres of Action, Comedy, Demons, Romance, Harem, Supernatural  what you will see is fan-service, cliches, fan-service, loli-action, fan-service and a lot of ecchi but the plot sucks near the end<br />
I don&#039;t know if the plot at the end is what will happen in the manga, but<br />
everything was rushed

    There was not a review for this and there are only four episodes out atm but i felt like it still deserved a review.<br />
<br />
All of this is based off of four episodes: <br />
<br />
Story: So far the story is decent at the begging its a little slow and you think it will be just another demon slaying-animal serving there master type of anime, After a few episodes you find out that this series has a good mix of different themes which makes it pretty enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Art: I find the art is decent for this anime, although many people like the mangas art better. If your hesitant because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22846">
        of a little difference just ignore that fact and watch few episodes.<br />
<br />
Sound: Sound is good im no expert on anime sounds but theres ussualy the terrible the ok and the good<br />
<br />
Charaters: the characters are well matched for this anime even though its one of those animes where you get intruduced to more characters the farther the story goes it has its own uniqueness that makes it match the story well.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: if your into the romance action ecchi stuff then this is the show for you

    On my opinion, Omamori Himari is one of my few favorite manga that I have read so far in my 20s. It is one of the Ecchi and Harem anime that can&#039;t miss for the fans of Harem anime. (Truth:Is it my imagination or Yuuto is the only man that play the protagonist of the entire story?) <br />
<br />
Despite the differs between the plot between the manga and anime version, I could tell that the anime ending are even faster than the manga counter part  (Truth:Something that become the major questions of all times, could anime ending is the canon of the manga counterpart? If

          <span style="display: none;" id="review45089">
        so, when the ending of the manga version would appear and if not, is the ending is the only exclusive for anime only?) <br />
<br />
<br />
Character design is much little more advance than the manga version, that&#039;s all I can say...<br />
<br />

    Omamori himari is nothing groundbreaking, I gave it a 7 because I found it to be the most average you could get an anime and 7 is my idea of average. In engineering class we had to come up with a chart for a program that would design a movie based off of a few inputs from the viewer and this made me feel like the people who write anime nowadays have one. It seems like so many of the animes coming out today aim for average, as if there was some sort of algorithm out there where one could simply put in a few

          <span style="display: none;" id="review58081">
        ideas and a machine would spew out a script that used the same old concepts and ideas. <br />
<br />
Story: it&#039;s pretty simple, a boy named yuuto turns 16 and finds out he&#039;s from a family of demon hunters when he is attacked on the roof of the school only to be saved by his sexy cat bodyguard himari. He remembers nothing from his past because the charm that was protecting him for 16 years was so powerful. From then on it&#039;s your typical harem anime that has an ever-growing cast of female characters and 1 perverted friend. If you&#039;ve ever seen steel angel kurumi the plot is very similar to that. like I said the story for OH was far from original but I actually did enjoy the theme they used of yuuto and himari fighting ayakashi and feel that it actually had a good deal of potential. The problem was that like many animes this one could&#039;ve easily changed a few things around and been a lot better than it was but instead they stuck to the same boring pattern so many before it have fallen to, I will never understand the people that make these and why they can&#039;t see these obvious mistakes they&#039;re making. One thing I really get sick of seeing is the main character only surrounded by girls and the 1 guy friend only being a pervert. If you&#039;ve seen clannad you&#039;ll see Okazaki continuously runs off to hang out with sunohara, I loved seeing that because it was such a simple thing to do and its realistic but you never see it, as if the main character never has any friends and then once he does they&#039;re all girls.<br />
<br />
Art: while the art was standard the character designs were great. The only problem I had with it was the huge boobs were a little bit excessive, at some point it starts hurting the art not helping it. Still the harem of girls yuuto manages to collect does have it&#039;s gems, himari was hotter than your average harem girl and if you appreciate that kind of thing (who doesn&#039;t) and you don&#039;t really have plans to watch anything after what you&#039;re currently on you should check this out. Along with himari, Liz was another above average character and in my opinion that somewhat redeems this slightly, while I&#039;d much rather have originality over above average beauty I won&#039;t complain if they decide to throw in some great looking women (although I wish they&#039;d do both).<br />
<br />
Sound: I liked the sound in OH, the opening theme was very catchy and I enjoyed it more than many other openings I&#039;ve heard. The music during the anime got &quot;different&quot; at times but I liked it and felt it was a nice change from the average music You&#039;ll hear.<br />
<br />
Character: I hate to bash an anime but the characters were all typical harem characters. Yuuto was a spineless idiot who did nothing. Himari was his protective horny servant, Shizuku was another horny girl with a dark past, Liz was a horny girl who likes serving tea, Kuesu was a horny girl who is an enemy but hangs around with the rest of the bunch, and rinko was the tsundere best friend who loves yuuto. None of the characters grow throughout the anime at all, the only change we see is yuuto finally taking charge and deciding to fight which really wasn&#039;t all that big. The relationship between himari and yuuto suffered horribly, we didn&#039;t even get to see a real kiss between the two because it got interrupted by the rest of the cast, which was really annoying because I knew that&#039;s what would happen but was still hoping to see it.<br />
<br />
Overall I still think this series has potential but it will need more seasons to reach it. If we do see more series I&#039;d like to see more of 3 things, yuuto becoming stronger, fighting real enemies, and yuuto and himari&#039;s relationship grow. I hate how there aren&#039;t any animes out there were 2 people are in a relationship before the last episode, it can be done and we can enjoy watching the 2&#039;s relationship grow even beyond 2 that are just starting their relationship. I would like to see less of the harem constantly interrupting at every possible moment and attacking yuuto with lust or anger. There will have to be many changes if they wish to accomplish this seeing that the last episode of this 1st season got us nowhere, yuuto even said he didn&#039;t want himari around (I believe someone told him he must really want that cat around and he said no) which really kind of pissed me off since he does want himari around and now he&#039;s just contradicting himself. Either way I will watch a second season if they make one and I&#039;m still reading the manga which is different from the anime where the anime starts making changes when they go on the trip to paint, which I also think is a big mistake.
