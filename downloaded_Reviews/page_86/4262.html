    This is how you do pure ecchi correctly. No attempt at an excuse story which no one cares about anyway, no mindless tits and panty shots where it doesn&#039;t make sense, no generic harem elements. Just straight-up lewdness of the very highest degree, and the closest thing to hentai you&#039;ll ever find without actually crossing the line.<br />
<br />
Kiss x Sis can be described in pretty much a single sentence: a guy named Keita and his two step sisters Ako and Riko doing horny and perverted things to each other around the clock, solely because they want to. That&#039;s all. That&#039;s all it needs to be. What

          <span style="display: none;" id="review187283">
        makes Kiss x Sis stand out is that for once it is actually hot. The problem with most ecchi anime is that their ecchiness generally only consists of random panty shots and breasts plastered across the screen, and I think most people will agree with me if I say that you need something a bit more sophisticated than that if you want to turn people on. But Kiss x Sis has almost none of that. Instead what the show does have is countless deep kissing scenes, licking and sucking of just about all body parts, grinding, masturbation scenes, on-screen orgasms, countless types of sexual plays and more. In other words it actually *does something* in a sexual sense, instead of solely trying to rely on eye candy. As a result, what you end up with is a non-hentai show which can legitimately be used as fap material without forcing yourself, and that&#039;s something extraordinarily rare to see. N-Not that I would do something like that myself or anything.<br />
<br />
As far as ecchi elements themselves go, I think Kiss x Sis is most likely the best anime within the genre. There is no other anime which can consistently get you aroused as a viewer as much as this one does. The only thing it&#039;s lacking a bit is actual characterization, as there is very little information given about the girls themselves which make you not think of them all too much. All you&#039;ll really care about is seeing them get all hot and bothered with each other. Not that that&#039;s too big of a problem per se, but if the show had as likeable girls as other borderline hentai series like To LOVE-Ru Darkness for example, then I&#039;d probably have to give this a 10, as in that case it&#039;d be as close to perfect as an ecchi anime can get.<br />
<br />
Another thing that ticks me off a bit is the side characters in the show, specifically Keita&#039;s homeroom teacher, her little sister as well as a random glasses girl from his school. While they&#039;re not bad characters per se, and while they also have really hot ecchi scenes with Keita, I can&#039;t help but feel like those scenes would have been even better had they simply starred Ako and Riko instead. The wincest feel is a major aspect of the show after all, and thus not using it to its full potential feels a bit wasted to me.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack mostly consists of background music appropriate for sex scenes. Yes, it&#039;s just the kind of jazzy background music you&#039;d find in porn films. On the other hand the opening theme is surprisingly awesome and super catchy. As far as voice acting goes, be prepared to hear a lot of moaning and dirty talk, but the seiyuus definitely pull it off with flying colors.<br />
<br />
Overall there are definitely a few things here and there I can nitpick on but they&#039;re still quite minor stuff. What you see is still what you get, and Kiss x Sis stands out as quite likely the hottest non-hentai anime ever made, and that&#039;s a quite impressive achievement in and of itself. If you&#039;ve only seen the TV airing of the show, then I&#039;d recommend giving the OVA series a shot as well as they&#039;re significantly lewder and all-round better for its own intents and purposes.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for a textbook showcasing of what really good ecchi looks like, then look no further than this. Just make sure that your parents aren&#039;t home when you decide to watch it.

    As far as I’m concerned, the best (and probably most honest) ecchi show next to &quot;B Gata H Kei&quot;. <br />
<br />
***<br />
[Quick Review (Weighting, Scores)]<br />
<br />
Story (*1.5): 5 – neutral score, as this has no story – which works in favor of its purpose.<br />
<br />
Characters (*1.5): 7 – no development of any sort but fun characters and bearable male lead. Consider them as means to an end.<br />
<br />
Art (*1.0): 8 – very polished, cute character designs (not too childish), normal-sized breasts (TYVM).<br />
<br />
Sound (*0.5): 5 – average. If you like cutesy J-Pop you may enjoy it more than I did.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (*2.0): 9 – extremely sexy with certain comedy value. Look no

          <span style="display: none;" id="review60493">
        further if you want a quick fix of ecchi goodness.<br />
<br />
Overall (Sum/6.5): 7.2 – don’t be fooled : within the ecchi genre I’d consider this one of its finest. Objectively, it obviously can’t compare to shows with ‘real value’. <br />
***<br />
<br />
Let’s get straight down to business. If you’re looking for something other than ecchi – like heartwarming romance or mind-shattering drama – get the hell outta here. It may seem counter-intuitive, but I have to praise this short series for not trying to establish any kind of story - therefore being incredibly honest about its intention. That is: entertaining us, the viewers, with outrageously sexy moments, scene after scene. Unlike a lot of other shows in this genre, this won’t shove a contrived story down your sore throat that would make you end up in ICU due to whiplash from shaking your head (I’m looking at you, “Rosario+Vampire”, “Sekirei”, “Highschool DxD”, insert more failures of your own choice). <br />
<br />
If you care for the premise, it is as simple as that: the sole focus is on brother Keita and his two step-sisters (read: not blood-related) Ako and Riko. As it happens in the fabulous anime world, these two very lovely young ladies are head over heels for their rather wimpy brother (his whiney voice may test your endurance). What ensues are pubertal attempts of seduction to woo the reluctant brother. Everywhere. At any time. At any cost. No-holds-barred. Luckily, the brother most-often ends up going with the flow instead of stereotypically nose-bleeding his way out of the situations or keeping his distance with stoic composure (which would have otherwise killed the fun quickly). It draws the line to hentai by cockteasing you just far enough to leave the possible outcome to your - by then - more than vivid imagination.  <br />
<br />
As previously hinted, the brother doesn’t completely fall into the stereotype of a pathetic harem lead. Although his voice is irritatingly shaky and his initial reluctance to the sisterly advances makes you question his sanity (and sexuality), he does in fact not shy away from getting it on with the girls once they drilled through his socially imposed (feeble) moral layers. Lo and behold! Let’s put those asexual pathetic male anime characters to the torch, for Keita has arrived! Can you imagine a guy actually exhibiting sexual desire when the time has come with a willing female? Well of course you can, since you are just one of those (an apology to the unlikely female reader(s), at this point I cannot fathom your reasons for watching). But now you can imagine seeing it on the anime screen, how great is that? Hope dies last, or so I’ve been told. High five! (In hindsight, I’ll be fair and say that Keita is still a clueless retard that I’d butcher passionately if I ever had the chance but by anime standards he’s doing pretty well). <br />
<br />
Now that the biggest danger of a cockblock is out of the way, let’s talk about the sisters. Remember the good ol’ school days, when pubescent girls grow boobs and discover their power over the male sex? Ako and Riko sure won’t waste a lot of time talking it through. They are (awe-)inspiringly honest about their affection towards Keita. French kissing and breast-fondling inclusive (don’t be naïve thinking that this show won’t have more in store). A comical dynamic is created by the sisters’ rivalry in their attempts to outdo each other. Sometimes you’ll be laughing, other times your jaw will hit the floor at lightning speed. Trust me, it’s a good feeling.<br />
<br />
At the point of writing this review, I’ve seen 7 out of the announced 8 OVA episodes. With the exception of the last episode (#6, as the first one was named ep #0), which turned out to be a dull generic school examination episode (with no direct brother x sister action), this series was an oasis in the desert called “ecchi genre”. The animation is excellent, the focus narrow and the narration straight-forward. They did a lot of things right, a tip of the hat well-deserved.<br />

    Once in awhile I&#039;ll come across a great anime that boasts an exemplary plot with dynamic and intriguing characters. Then there are shows like Kiss x Sis, which possess neither of these qualities, but are enjoyable to watch for...other reasons~<br />
<br />
I was quite impressed with this show. Sure, the plot is limited to a bunch of extremely sexual scenes and the characters don&#039;t have much depth, but Kiss x Sis is able to succeed where other anime like it have not. I&#039;ve watched plenty of harem/ecchi anime and have really enjoyed some of them. However, I find that a lot of these anime fail to effectively

          <span style="display: none;" id="review224970">
        use ecchi elements. Sometimes they&#039;ll show a random panty shot or have an unnecessary close up on a character&#039;s breasts. Such scenes are usually meaningless and fail to stimulate the viewer, which is what they intend to do, and instead end up just wasting time. Kiss x Sis actually embodies the term ecchi by being incredibly hot and exciting without crossing the border into hentai. <br />
<br />
Plot: --/10<br />
<br />
Some ecchi anime try to throw in a plot to go along with the fan service in an attempt to have more meaning and depth. However these &quot;plots&quot; usually end up being completely nonsensical and poorly composed, and instead of making these anime better like they were intended to, these oftentimes unintelligible plot lines actually make the shows worse. Kiss x Sis doesn&#039;t bother to spend time developing a meaningless story and instead focuses on making as many creatively stimulating moments as possible, which definitely works in its favor. <br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that this ova initially aired back in 2008. Even though it&#039;s older, the female characters are still more detailed and have better designs than many of the characters in newer anime that I&#039;ve seen. This makes them even more enjoyable to watch when they&#039;re doing dirty things and makes me sincerely wish that I was in that lucky dastard Keita&#039;s shoes.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
<br />
The voice acting was fine, but I was really impressed with the believable moans of ecstasy and other sexual noises that the seiyuu made. The girls just sounded so cute, which heightened the overall experience for me. The theme songs and soundtrack are decent, but nothing to write home about.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8/10<br />
<br />
While they aren&#039;t developed as characters, the cast is still really fun to watch. Especially Riko and Ako Suminoe, the main character&#039;s sisters and the stars of the show. They both have very fun personalities and their unquenchable love for their brother is admirable. The two of them have practically all of the qualities that I&#039;d want in an older sister (I-If I was into incestuous stuff. Which I&#039;m totally not. Y-You gotta believe me!) They&#039;re just so great, and watching their flirtatious advancements towards their brother was an enjoyable experience. The other prominent girls showcased in this anime are also pleasant to watch and each have their own moments in the spotlight. They definitely were a positive contribution to the show. Now Keita himself if a rather plain and generic character, but that&#039;s okay, since his purpose is to be that character that the viewers imagine themselves as, so he really doesn&#039;t need to be anything special.<br />
<br />
Entertainment: 9/10<br />
<br />
I&#039;d be lying if I told you that I wasn&#039;t turned on multiple times while watching this. And that&#039;s exactly what an ecchi anime is supposed to do, which is why I ended up being quite fond of this show. I loved seeing all of the dirty situations that the sisters got their brother in. There were many hot and unique ones, and it was a joy watching all of them. Kiss x Sis also managed to be absolutely hilarious at times and kept a smile on my face throughout all of the episodes.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
<br />
If extreme ecchi isn&#039;t your thing or it makes you uncomfortable, then don&#039;t watch Kiss x Sis. If you believe that a lewd animated show which was created purely for entertainment is &quot;wrong&quot; and &quot;disgusting,&quot; then don&#039;t watch it and don&#039;t condescend people who enjoy it. It&#039;s as simple as that. And if you&#039;re someone who wants to watch something sexy and entertaining, I&#039;d definitely recommend Kiss x Sis. <br />

    Probably the most honest, straightforward and amazing ecchi out there.<br />
I wouldn&#039;t say is borderline hentai, but it will seem so on moments.<br />
<br />
I love pretty much all of it. The story is not mind blowing, but its very well explained.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s way more than just accidental boob touching. Way more.<br />
Your mind will scream omg.<br />
<br />
The thing I admire and love about the story and the execution is how everyone but Keita sees the stepsister thing as completely normal. That&#039;s where the fun is. He is barely able to hold it and is constantly under some guilt trip. Not to say his sisters aren&#039;t, but less so. Even his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181804">
        parents tell him that if he should marry one of them. So in a way this anime could be seen as a battle between Keita&#039;s guilty mind and his instincts.<br />
<br />
I feel the anime met a short end. It doesn&#039;t feel like an ending, but it was great for all its glory and sheer pervy-ness.<br />
<br />
I highly recommend it to ecchi lovers, even though there&#039;s no chance you haven&#039;t watched it by now. In case you haven&#039;t, drop all your worries and go watch it.

    Unfortunately I watched this series after the adaptation 2010 version, but it mattered little. The little prequel story episodes ended from OVA episode 0-around 6-9. <br />
<br />
SPOILER ALERT<br />
Around those episodes is where Keita is already accepted into Tamahide highschool and funny episodes revolve around events that happen afterwards. The OVA episodes are no different from the 2010 adaptation, however the few OVA episodes that were set before Keita entered Tamahide, I&#039;ll have to say, a lot more ecchi and borderline hentai I have seen, that it rivals To Love Ru Darkness. <br />
<br />
Nonetheless it doesn&#039;t matter too much the order you watch the two anime, they both

          <span style="display: none;" id="review101179">
        are good and provide a similar amount of enjoyment. I enjoyed this series and will follow it until it ends since they plan to continue it. <br />
<br />
Of course this is my personal opinion of how the anime isn&#039;t that bad, and might be worth watching, you don&#039;t have to listen to it. <br />
<br />
The characters are unique in some ways and each personality add to the work as a whole, tying in the not really progressing plot it turns out to be a good chuckle/time killer. <br />
<br />
I would recommend watching it if you like similar series such as To Love Ru, or Rosario + Vampire.

    There is a moment on Kiss x Sis (what a title) when we see for the very first time with the sisters Ako and Riko alone in the same scene and with not a sight of their brother Keita, what they star to do? obviously, talk about their favorite subject in the world, Keita then they go to the room of Keita, where they start to clean up because “that&#039;s way Keita have his cute sisters for”, right?, then they found a porn magazine featuring incestuous threesomes, then they do what all males know what chicks do when this happen, they build up a bear-pillow

          <span style="display: none;" id="review53451">
        mannequin who represent their brother, Keita and star to &quot;practice&quot;. They discuss over one of them is going in the market who represent Keita dick, they grab each other boobs and then their star to French kissing while their hips move by their own, imagine than the other is Keita, after a couple of minutes they came in a sort of rainbow interplanetary orgasm (2001 reference?) all this accompanied by classy music. They look apparently quite proud of what they just do, anxious to put in practice their new knowledge that of course it will be ever mentioned again.<br />
<br />
Animated incest between 2 girls who looks like they barely have 12 years old. All this and more in a NO hentai labeled ova series.<br />
<br />
Kiss x Sis is not only incompetent on an artistic level, not that will be too fucking nice, its morally fuck up beyond believe and the incest stuff its like a 5% of the whole deal. It’s a craptastic festival of epic proportions,it&#039;s not good anime,it&#039;s not good art or even good porn, for a pretended erotic comedy it&#039;s an insult to the words erotic, comedy and the concept who unites them. Kiss x Sis is nothing more that a terrible piece of  junk with ugly morals, annoying characters, bad animation and not even original fan service, the fact than this have a series of ova’s , a TV version and a freaking manga who run for almost 10 volumes its beyond my goddamn comprehension ,the fact that some people is actually winning money with this made the hole thing a cruel joke.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the show follow the daily live of Keita you average nothing special at all Japanese high school student, and his two over-sexualized moe step sisters who make the impossible win his heart (I believe this is a metaphor for his cock, I cannot ensure) and pretty much that is. Raised together since they childhood (you remember anything from when you have 3 years old? Neither do i) by his creepy parents, your douchbag perverted glasses father and the mother of the twins, who is probably the worst human being I ever see in anime.<br />
<br />
They encourage them, after all they are not blood related, so everything is OK. It’s so nice to now that a lot of people put their lust over feelings and all that psychological crap.<br />
<br />
Now, I understand that comedy is possibly the most subjective element in any kind of entertainment, but I was stone faced all the time and some times directly face palmed on embarrassment (rainbows dicks, RAINBOWS DICKS EVERYWHERE), now off course we all know that nobody really watch this for the comedy and if you do, I must say than I almost admire your detachment, almost.<br />
<br />
Whatever, let&#039;s go to the real deal here Ako and Riko, I am not going to deny that their designs were appealing, even if “girls who look like they have 12 years old” its not really my thing, they were are cute, until of course they open their mouths.Its not a single word, not one, ever, that it doesn’t have to do with jump in their brother bones, it&#039;s absolutely nothing that we know about them who not have direct relation with Keita, their life and reason of existence its try to screw his brother, they sneak into his room, sleep besides him, the cook for her, they feed him, they search in his garbage, uses his underwear, sniff them, extra points if has been used recently and its unwashed. Funny, right? Actually I was kind of sad for them, at least for a while, later I just stop caring. <br />
They&#039;re nothing more than gross and pathetic fembots with brains designed for some perverted creep. They are also pretty much the representation of the most basic of the womanizer fantasy of a lot of men&#039;s, indeed there are gross and perverted, but they&#039;re only and excusably towards Keita, you know,&quot;a slut in the bed, a faithful wife to others eyes” kind of bullshit, if they ever show any interest toward others guys or a “free sexuality”, there are be labeled as sluts as fast as you can say double standards. <br />
<br />
For the rest of the cast concern you have your typical manganekko, she is shy, a virgin (DUH) with big breast who fantasize with being raped over a fountain of pee, lovely. An annoying loli for the lolicons and off course the sexbomb sensei, who is, guess what? a virgin and otaku closet, the wet dream of any men, right?.<br />
<br />
They are also the classroom friends of Keita, who envy him and his “luck”. You know you’re in big trouble when your favorite character is the idiotic horny friend #2.<br />
<br />
Ah, yes, I almost forget it, Keita, in all what I concern it’s a fucking asshole.<br />
<br />
They are terrible and awful humans beings, pathetic and with any sense of dignity, I was expecting that one of them have a mental breakdown, reasons they did not lack and kill the rest of the cast “school days-fashion” but I guess the creator it’s not smart enough to do something so idiotic. If any of these characters had any plausible association with humanity, it will be painful and embarrassing. That’s why the fan service on Kiss x Sis, fails so miserable with me,It&#039;s not erotic if you are annoying, creep out and disgust, for who is getting the action, it maybe, just maybe, be forgettable if there actually have sex, but they don’t or at least not in the way I understand sex, in regardless they give us a lot of unoriginal foreplay and shitty humor. What boredom.<br />
<br />
A show who constructs his entire premise and defense (if they need any) by the fans over an excuse so cheap as “its OK because they are not blood related” but later the author have the nerve to do one of the most obnoxious and low things (read 1 paragraph) I ever saw in my life, now off course I am been ridiculous expecting that someone think like me on this one, even I as a “loser Yuri fan boy” I can&#039;t believe my anger toward that scene, but...WHY IN THE NAME OF HELL THE TREE OF THEM ARE NOT BLOOD RELATED THEN!?	<br />
<br />
Aki Sora and Yosuga no Sora are also incestuous crap , but At least they have the BALLS to go all way down with his true intentions and no travesty their premise with cheap and low excuses to avoid criticisms and put the fans on a hypocrite safe spot.<br />
<br />
I like to be honest, even when I fap. Thank you very much.<br />

    A compelling plot, a diverse mosaic of characters and unforgettable dialogue: these are all the qualities of an excellent show. The question is, does Kiss X Sis boast any of these characteristics?<br />
Absolutely not.<br />
Luckily, unless you were hoping that this anime would be a touching tale about the forming of fraternal bonds and companionship between siblings, this revelation should not garner disappointment.<br />
Simply put, Kiss X Sis sets out to give you some top quality fap material, and nothing more. The story is not interesting and the characters are not unique. Truthfully, the only plot comes from the unrealistic premise of two sisters lusting after their younger

          <span style="display: none;" id="review165331">
        brother. And aside from lots of great humour and Ecchi, this show has no other redeemable qualities.<br />
Although this may seem bad, Kiss X Sis provides such an unprecedented amount of nudity and perversion that it more than overcompensates for otherwise being a complete failure of an anime. Hell, I think that it’s safe to say that you will be hard pressed to find another anime as sexually obscene as this one. So, in conclusion, if you’re into Ecchi (or incest), you should definitely give it a shot and remember to lock your door and have some tissues handy. <br />

    First off I&#039;m a big fan of the &quot;Hoshizora Monogatari&quot; credit music (I seriously love that track).  The Characters weren&#039;t that whiney either, had good voice acting, and would give their sounds a 7.<br />
<br />
Many people like to rate Ecchi pretty low because it&#039;s Ecchi, but I&#039;d like to not be &#039;that guy&#039; and will categorize this as being an Ecchi, and not Death Note or Fate/Zero.<br />
<br />
Kiss X Sis in particular is a unique Ecchi.  No other Ecchi has made me feel this way thus far, and has done a great job at captivating mood in multiple situations both eroticaly, and in humorous other

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186928">
        ways.  For an Ecchi, the story is fair, and the Sisters are unforgettable Characters (both with their distinctive personality and traits, but overall desires/goals).  The MC wasn&#039;t annoyingly shy and/or prepubescent like most other Ecchi and is a pretty likable guy.  I was sad to hear that the OVA recently ended, but am quite happy I got to enjoy 24 episodes (watch the OVA after the 2010 series).<br />
<br />
I guarantee you will like that like this Ecchi Anime; It&#039;s a must-see.

    I regret being born because I had to lay my eyes on this utter trash. The technical aspects are fine, but the characters are disgusting, the plot is disgusting, the idea is disgusting, and my life is just that much worse from watching this. I nearly threw up multiple times watching this, and I&#039;d like to think I&#039;m pretty hard to disgust. I watched this ~5 months ago and I still have flashbacks when people mention anything that could remotely remind me of this. I honestly would have rather fought in world war one and get actual war flashbacks than have seen this. Unless you

    I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. For anyone who loves ecchi, but needs a good plot to go with their T&amp;A, this is a must watch. While the &quot;barbie-girl&quot; anatomy is a minus, this anime still borders on hentai. Any real man is going to be aroused by it. However, lust is not the only focus of this work. It delves into the intricacies of the mind. Everyone has urges, the wish to suppress those urges, and the wish to indulge in those urges. I think this anime shows that very well.<br />
<br />
I recommend watching the 2010 TV series first as there will

        be a large part of the story missing if you just watch the OVAs straight through. However, I think it would be most ideal to watch the episodes in the chronological order they were aired.

    Well... this is where it all started. <br />
<br />
Kiss x Sis was my introduction to anime. What a place to begin. And yet, it was a fun place to start in a lot of ways. <br />
<br />
It was the spring of my 10th grade year of high school, (2012.) I had a friend who was really into anime. He recently downloaded this show along with a bunch of other series&#039; on a website. We thought &quot;Kiss x Sis&quot; would be a good laugh with near comical fan service and a story with enough insanity and taboos to make it hilarious! Thus, one fateful day in morning study

          <span style="display: none;" id="review210774">
        hall... it all began...<br />
<br />
Well... this show certainly delivered in terms of these expectations we shared. It was funny, borderline pornographic and sometimes endearing. The relationship that Ako Nee and Riko Nee share with their step brother, while often times driven by lust, is one that provided an interesting and often frowned upon dichotomy. The two sisters would bicker and banter over their younger brother, which accounts for a great deal of hilarity within the show. Being caught in the middle, Keita cannot dare to act upon any small semblance of desire he may have for his own sisters. He cannot even hope to succeed in romantic pursuits with other young women because of the tug of war that continually occurs under his own roof, within his own family. <br />
<br />
The story was funny. The subject controversial. My buddy and I really enjoyed it. Perhaps not so much in the sense that it be taken seriously, but as a show that provides those much needed chuckles during a dull day of school. At times perhaps, these laughs would be slightly cringed or the fan service would be excessive to the point of hilarity. In the full knowledge that this series wasn&#039;t meant to be taken all that seriously, I went with it, laughed along and enjoyed something for what it was... not for a masterpiece that it didn&#039;t set out to be. <br />
<br />
With all these things being said, I really enjoyed my FIRST anime. <br />
<br />
I had been interested in seeing anime before, yet never actively pursued it on my own. Some people start with Naruto, Dragonball Z, Bleach or One Piece. I had the distinct pleasure of starting off with this gem. As for things that really interested me after seeing this, my first anime, I&#039;ll go into further detail... <br />
<br />
This anime theme song was the first that I had ever heart... the synthesizers revved up, an infectious beat was set, and a cute Japanese voice sang &quot;Kiss me...&quot; I was hooked. A cornucopia of color blanketed the background of my screen and I was introduced to the various characters. All of this was slightly bizarre at first. I was listening to a language I didn&#039;t understand and seeing what I thought resembled an acid trip in terms of the color and chaos. I loved it though. And the other qualities of anime would soon charm me to the point of finding more to watch. <br />
<br />
Overall, this show... it really isn&#039;t for everyone. And I mean that in the most straightforward way imaginable. In fact, chances are you wont like this anime at all. Incest is a controversial topic. Gross to some, alluring to others, comedic to myself within this context. However, I trust you dear viewers to understand your limitations as to what you can handle, what you can enjoy and whether or not you want to partake in a mindless, lustful ecchi. It really can be quite fun once in a while, especially with good friends. <br />
<br />
This show was a good time, hardly a favorite at this point, but it brings back a lot of good memories and serves to be the beginning of a deep passion for anime that I have to this day. The nostalgia value plays a decent role, yet I&#039;m sure some of you could definitely find things to enjoy about this series, if not the series as a whole. Give it a go if you want, I guess. <br />
<br />
Overall- 7

    I am genuinely surprised at the fact that I was able to watch even 3 episodes of this piece of burning shit on a stick in hell. I don&#039;t know whether to hate the parents or the children more because both are equally at fault and should not have existed in the first place. The only reason I was able to last watching this show so long is because I muted the god damn thing and turned on the Mario Sunshine title theme on a loop. At least Domestic Na Kanojo had some realistic and humanized factors in the beginning. (Not counting the sex)

    It tries to be a passable Ecchi Anime with a vague story to propel these absurd scenes and reasoning, but for the love of christ it is constantly pushing the incredibly weird fetish thing so far into your face that it just becomes literally un-watchable.<br />

We get that they are non-blood related siblings and it&#039;s relatively acceptable. Their parents allow it and downright endorse it along with their neighbours.<br />

The main character is a socially and sexually maladjusted dimwit, like most Harem Leads, except in this case he seems to have incredibly strange fetishes and having roughly every single negative trope possible. All this while simultaneously denying

          <span style="display: none;" id="review197539">
        any sort of relationship between his sisters and himself, while committing sexual acts and having fantasies about them consistently. And they throw themselves at him naked almost hourly. That too.<br />
<br />
He also masturbates DAILY while his not-incest twin &quot;sisters&quot; are at each others throats to have sex and marry him. What is the reasoning behind this? He wants it enough to masturbate, but not enough to go to the more-than-willing source that is literally throwing themselves at him anyways.<br />
<br />
The fairly consistent ecchi moments are just not enough to keep this absolute trash afloat. I am trying different Anime&#039;s that touch the subject of &quot;Incest&quot; to see how they handle it, specifically after I saw OreImo and it decided to handle the subject so poorly and immaturely when it came time to openly show it after a series long foreshadowing and heavy hints. This anime had a promising sounding premise, but then devolved into something that some studio apparently thought was a good idea to make.<br />
<br />
What people need to realize is that Ecchi is a sub -style of anime, a sub-genre or even sub-trope if you will that can affect an anime adversely in the audiences eyes. Focusing solely on ecchi is a terrible idea. You can pull off alot of other genre&#039;s by themselves like Action, Romance, Mystery, etc. But Ecchi isn&#039;t like those. It&#039;s a sub-type that enhances or lightens the mood with scenes and sexuality that typically wouldn&#039;t be there.<br />
<br />
This anime is proof that you simply cannot do Ecchi alone. It&#039;s a complete mess that will ultimately desensitize you to the show iteslf(and even Ecchi eliments in other animes as well maybe). Simply because they overuse the same tropes and predictable events through the entire series and the OVAs. The OVAs themselves are a different mess, because they dive face-first into a fully-blown pedophilia relationship with the main character, BOTH ways, and into body-odor fetish and urination fetish? What the hell this main character is such a stereotype... &quot;I&#039;m not a pervert, it&#039;s a misunderstanding!&quot; *Licks his sisters sweat off their bodies, making out with them, fondling them, enjoying a girl getting piss on him, fantasies with all of the above + his teachers... What the hell is this?<br />
<br />
Would no recommend at all. They started off with a story that could have flown reasonably well, but devolved into fetish-fuel that is the exact reason why people have strong misconceptions about Anime.

    While Kiss x Sis is far from amazing by any measure, I think it receives too much hate. The show is deliberate meant to push boundaries and shock the viewers, while still maintaining some innocence and &quot;cuteness.&quot; In this regard, I think the writers did an ok job. The OP fits perfectly considering the show&#039;s sort of incensty content. If you find yourself strangely aroused by this series, don&#039;t be too worried. Interestingly, the primarily flaw for me wasn&#039;t how ridiculous, improbable, and over-the-top the story is, but rather the voice of Keita, the male leading character. It annoyed me to no end. Anyway, if

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205760">
        you&#039;re looking for a show that earns the title of borderline hentai, while having no nudity, this may be your thing. But if you&#039;re looking for a compelling story with rich characters and deep romance, you&#039;re looking in the wrong place. I admire the creators for not trying to make the series into something it&#039;s not.

      Whenever I say PLOT it means I&#039;m talking about ASS &amp; BREAST<br />
<br />
  Kiss x Sis, By far a show that isn&#039;t afraid to flaunt what it is about. The story of this show revolves around  Keita &amp; his 2 step sisters Riko &amp; Ako. Now, if you watched this show you pretty much know what its mostly about. If you haven&#039;t then let me warn you, if you&#039;re not into HAREM, ECCHIE, &amp; possibly Hentai, this show is not for you. Because the PLOT is almost sufficating you in each episode &amp; thickens as the story presses forward. But if you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review132503">
        haven&#039;t watched it don&#039;t let the ecchiness &amp; harem &amp; slight hentai deter you from this heartfelt anime of 2 sisters wanting to be the center of their beloved brother&#039;s world. Now, I did not watch this anime because of the FANSERVICE, after a handful episodes &amp; if you have a heart you will actually grow an attachment to chacaters, moreso a perticular one amongst the sisters. By no means this slice of life anime is not only about PLOT there is a story to it with a side of hilaireous actions &amp; conversation between the characters. I&#039;ll cover more in detail in my breadown review.<br />
<br />
REVIEW &amp; scores ranging from 1-10, 1 being dreadful<br />
<br />
(7)STORY: As mentioned, this anime is NOT always about PLOT, PLOT, &amp; PLOT there&#039;s a connection between all the chacaters that each one is unique in their own way. From Keita&#039;s father always pushing him into manhood to his step-sisters constantly fighting for alone time with Keita.<br />
<br />
<br />
(8)ART: The animation in this show is on par with a lot of popular animes. But when it comes to certain points in the show, it becomes more detailed in focoused so that you can understand what it is hinting at. For example, what does a peach have in common with a girl? You&#039;ll get that one when you watch the show ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
(9)SOUND: When it came to sound they couldn&#039;t stress enough when it came to PLOT points in each episode to make you hear &amp; expirence what is happening to  Keita as he comes into contact with different girls at certain points in each episode.<br />
<br />
<br />
(8)CHARACTER:<br />
- Keita- A guy that only wants to study &amp; do well in school, but can&#039;t because of his step sister&#039;s advances on him &amp; his chastity. But he is reluctant to look at his step-sisters not only as sisters as each episode passes by but more as any common girl at his school.<br />
<br />
- Riko- The youngest sister out of the twins. Riko happens to be the more more bold &amp; shameless, instead of beating around the bush like her older sister does she charges head on not really caring how anything turns out. The only thing I see that her &amp; Keita have in common  is her intellagence . Their both not super bright, which is why she tends have a more of an understanding of Keita at certain points in each episode.<br />
<br />
- Ako- The oldest &amp; brightest out the twins. Ako a straight A student can&#039;t help but be a &quot;closet pervert&quot; when it comes to her step brother. Unlike her brash sister she considers outcomes on certain decisions she will make. But most of the time they backfire, &amp; she has to deal with the outcomes she wanted avoid from the start. The only thing I see Keita &amp; her have in common is their shyness in uncomfortable cituations or when they&#039;re put in the &quot;hot seat&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
(9)ENJOYMENT: All &amp; all this slice of life harem &amp; ecchie is a very enjoyable show if your not closed minded &amp; are willing to understand the relationships between each character.<br />
<br />
(9)OVERALL: I highly recommend this show to people who are a fan of ecchie &amp; harem &amp; borderline hentai animes.

    I watched the TV version of this show 10 years ago, when I was new to anime, when I was in my ecchi phase consuming every lewd show possible, and thought it was trash for a lot of reasons, but mainly because it was inconclusive, and empty after all.<br />
<br />
Just the other day someone told me there were two 12 episode versions of Kiss x Sis, where the OVAs took a long time (5 more years, until 2015) to complete, and they were just way better, and ecchi-er.<br />
So I gave it a chance for the sake of the old ecchi days, hoping it would wash away

          <span style="display: none;" id="review355319">
        the old bad experience with the TV version.<br />
<br />
I thought maybe, maybe, the TV series is the only one being trash, while this one, without the TV limiters, was the actual good product. Maybe.<br />
<br />
One may say that this is the best ecchi ever, because it goes beyond your usual tits-in-your-face ecchi, with random panty shots and stuff, because it is not a generic harem but focuses on the main trio, because it shows plenty of extremely sexual things but without crossing the line.<br />
<br />
My issue is exactly this. The line. It is actually okay to cross it, while being afraid of doing so and avoiding it is just...bad.<br />
<br />
Back in the day, anime were not afraid to show characters crossing the line, even in non-h shows.<br />
Nudity? A little bit is just fine. If I take a shower or a bath of course my nipples are in plain sight, no big deal, no need to crop stuff or to put arms and soap dispensers as convenient censoring. Nudity is not grotesque or scary. Really.<br />
Sex? Humanly normal. Couples in relationships have sex, so a sex scene here or there, or even mentioning &quot;having done the deed&quot; is just average.<br />
Heck, some NORMAL anime had uncensored lower parts, 10-20+ years ago.<br />
But for ecchi? Nope.<br />
Ecchi, and modern anime in general, is afraid of sex, and later it is becoming afraid of nudity too.<br />
Even mentioning the sole act is taboo, if your show is below R rating, lol. C&#039;mon even 7 year old kids know what sex is and that people do it.<br />
<br />
The fear of sexuality is not the case for Kiss x Sis of course. <br />
Here of course it is mentioned.<br />
Here of course there are lewd acts.<br />
<br />
But actual nudity? Oh no, none at all. Visuals are the tamest of tame anime, if we don&#039;t count implicit acts. Smooth crotches and nippleless chests, because this is how people like it! Cowards.<br />
Sex? Heck, you show incest, that a lot of people dread as a taboo, but actual sex that should be normal? Show the former, avoid the latter. <br />
Because all the wicked shit this show shows is normal for the writers of the anime, but sex would be too much. Yeah right, people normally would do all this stuff before having sex, or without having sex.<br />
In reality, most of the stuff shown here would be normal in a healty sexual relationship, after having had sex, but ecchi like this show apparently work in reverse.<br />
You take the steps in the opposite direction, and then stop before the last step and procrastinate indefinitely. I wonder if they end having sex in the last chapter of the source material just for shit and giggles, but seeing this, I have my doubts, lol.<br />
<br />
And this is what upsets me the most about ecchi shows.<br />
They&#039;re all in reverse.<br />
^ and this is why hentai is better. They show everything without fearing &quot;the big bad sex thing&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh but this is for the sake of turning on&quot;<br />
I don&#039;t think normal people would be turned on by TASTELESS sexuality like this, at least in my opinion.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, this show is almost decent overall, but not for its ecchi-ness.<br />
This show can be enjoyed for the comedy and romance aspects, more than anything else.<br />
<br />
Kiss x Sis is the perfect example of a ecchi failure.<br />
<br />
<br />

    So, this anime doesn&#039;t have a whole lot in the way of a &quot;story&quot; so to speak. You&#039;ll notice that I rated this a 10/10. You&#039;ll also notice if you look at my list that I don&#039;t just hand out 10s to any anime. Normally, I give out 10s to animes with complex plotlines and mysteries.<br />
<br />
However, this anime deserves its 10 rating because as an ecchi, this is as good as it gets, I absolutely loved every second that I watched it. It has pretty much everything an ecchi lover would like, cute moe girls who are perverts but are really cute about their perviness

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313701">
        and lascivious behavior, lots and lots of deep kissing scenes (including a three-way one) yet they manage to make it so they don&#039;t all look the same, yuri scenes, and bathing scenes. There&#039;s nothing to leave an ecchi lover disappointed about in this anime.<br />
<br />
Despite the extreme levels of sexual content in this anime though, they also did a fantastic job with character development as well as comedy. If you watch this as a comedy fan, you&#039;ll probably love it just as much as the ecchi fan who likes the sex. If you like both, well, even better. I could watch this family and their antics for several more seasons and I&#039;m really surprised at how lovable and well developed the characters are with only 12 episodes. The parents are actually some of the best written parents I&#039;ve seen in an anime with their shockingly permissive attitudes and shameless behavior around their kids. The sisters, meanwhile, are super pervy but also super adorable about it which gives the anime a very light-hearted feel.<br />
<br />
Its easy to think that because it has so much sex in it, that Kiss X Sis is just a soft hentai. But honestly, this anime could be good on its own without all the erotic scenes just because of how well written the characters are, but the sex does make it much much better and it certainly wouldn&#039;t be Kiss X Sis without it.<br />
<br />
This review wouldn&#039;t be complete without talking about the sound though. The opening song is a beautifully catchy and sweet song to listen to, and the jazz music played every time an erotic scene was happening had me laughing before anything even happened. And the sounds the girls make when they get aroused are... Well, you&#039;ll see ;)<br />
<br />
Even though I usually only give 10s to animes with complex mysteries, intellectual, or psychological questions, I gave this anime a 10 just because I fucking loved watching it so much. I really didn&#039;t want it to end but I look forward to watching the TV version and seeing what they did.

    Kissxsis, a story about 2 older sisters wanting to marry and fuck their younger brother, yet it is possibly the greatest ecchi anime in existence.  Why? Because it doesn&#039;t follow any generic harm cliches and how natural the characters interact with each other. ( spoiler free) (Important to enjoy the show fresh)<br />
<br />
<br />
This is probably the only anime that portrayed incest in a delightful enjoyable way. For an ecchi anime it surprisingly doesn&#039;t have much nudity. Instead of a panty shots or a &quot; guy walk in to girl dressing situation&quot;   Kissxsis generates erotic scenes out of everyday objects and situations that seems

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220189">
        so natural and ordinary.  Instead of presenting a nudity ecchi scene like any other generic harm ecchi anime would, Kissxsis would let the viewer&#039;s imagination decide instead. Thus as a result creating some of the most erotic and memorable scenes in ecchi history, depending on how dirty your mind is.<br />
<br />
The  director captures the dirty mind of a teenager boy very well and just how they want to &quot;see&quot; their sisters interact with those &quot;objects&quot;.<br />
<br />
This show also have a few side characters who also get into ecchi situations with Keita honourable mention ( the teacher and that glasses chick with big boobs) however I always hoped they would just gtfo as soon as possible since the sisters are just much better and cuter.<br />
<br />
In a nutshell, kissxsis presented the brother on sister relationship very sincerely. The incest does not feel forced and their love appears very genuine. The erotic scenes are top-notch in terms of &quot;arousing&quot; quality, honestly better than most hentais that have actual sex scenes lmao.<br />
<br />
If you are a fan of hentai or ecchi genre, Kissxsis is a MUST watch! These 12 episode went flying for me and still begging for more.<br />
<br />

    There are a lot of anime which make you think &quot;How is this not hentai?&quot;<br />
<br />
This is one of them. All the sexual themes in this show are really forced. Yes i understand that this isn&#039;t an anime to take seriously, yes i get that the plot is just two sisters trying to frick their brother. But this shows goes a bit to far with the sexual scenes. The only times i enjoyed these moments was when i was... yeah, you get the point. The characters in this show are fine i guess, the only one i didn&#039;t like was the loli. This show crossed the

        line when they added the loli scene.<br />
<br />
I dont wanna watch that thanks.<br />

    This is undoubtedly one of the most heavy ecchi series out there, and that results in quite a few scenes that are both daring and memorable. However, the show also resorts to cliche ecchi harem situations more often than I&#039;d like. It&#039;s still pretty funny, though. The premise - the male lead who has two step sisters lusting after him, with everyone but him thinking of it as completely normal - was actually one of the main sources of comedy for me. <br />
<br />
 Characterisation is on the simple side, but Keita&#039;s sisters and teacher are fun characters nonetheless, each bringing in their own shade of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323438">
        pervertedness. The anime also.. eh.. &quot;explores&quot; quite a number of sexual deviancies, with scenes ranging from funny (such as Keita&#039;s body odor fetish), awkward and weird (things having to do with Mikuni and.. *ahem*.. &#039;bodily fluids&#039;) to why-does-this-exist (&#039;This&#039; being Mikazuki, the loli). <br />
<br />
 I don&#039;t see Keita getting into lustful situations with his step sisters and teacher as a problem. The whole incest deal should be taken with a grain of salt anyway, and if the idea of sexual tension between a student and teacher creeps you out, I can assure you that the show goes out of its way to filter that creepy factor out of it – in a way I won’t spoil. Besides, the teacher is only 23 years old, so who cares, amiright? In a comedy, pushing the limits like this should be okay. However, Mikazuki getting similar treatment despite her childlike appearance still felt a bit icky to me.<br />
<br />
 Overall, Kiss x Sis is a flawed but enjoyable series, recommendable to people who like &quot;plot&quot; and who aren&#039;t too tight on their morals in fiction.
