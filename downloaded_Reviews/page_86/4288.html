The show is almost feels like swimming in an ocean of rage and frustration for many reasons. For a romance based series, Kimi no Iru Machi sure likes to play around with the idea but then twists it in all sorts of angles. These angles do not connect well in any way but instead ends up making a shape out of wrong proportions. As a follower of the original manga that began to ran years before the debut of this anime series, I am definitely not satisfied from what I see. It feels like I’m drowning

          <span style="display: none;" id="review114913">
        in a sea of despair.<br />
<br />
Kimi no Iru Machi (A Town Where You Live) is an animated series based off the manga of the same name written by Seo Kouji. The author is previously known for his other work, Suzuka that also received an anime adaptation based off of his manga. So now it’s his time to once again step it up and bring forth a romantic comedy for people to enjoy. Unfortunately, it seems like the series doesn’t step itself up but rather falls even further behind from the OVAs that debuted prior to this.<br />
<br />
The series follows main male protagonist Haruto Kirishima as a high school student living on the countryside. As a healthy boy of his age, he falls under the category of the typical high school student with thoughts running through his head. These thoughts includes schoolwork, his future, and the obvious: girls. This is because Haruto has a crush on another female student. Will have the courage to ask her out? What happens if he gets rejected? Will Haruto ever become a man? These might be a few questions for thought for potential anime only viewers at first glance. However, this isn&#039;t’ exactly what you might expect.<br />
<br />
For whatever reason, the anime decides to skip around and go straight into an arc that is covered later on from the manga. It’s disappointing given the fact that important factors and development in the beginning between Haruto and another main female protagonist are left mostly in unexplored territory. The series does pull out the old trick in the book as in the form of flashbacks. But honestly though, this doesn’t work well in terms of a romance developing series. For our main female protagonist, Eba Yuzuki, this is even more frustrating to watch because the lack character driven concept. It also doesn’t help by the fact that Haruto himself is not exactly one of those characters where we get to know from the beginning. <br />
<br />
As for Haruto, the boy clearly has eyes set on a particular someone but not exactly whom you might expect. As mentioned before, this series skips around and omits parts from the manga that clearly accelerates its plot. As for Haruto, the guy seems to lack a personality and often acts reserved around others. He is caring on the outside but often makes rash decisions while observing from the backgrounds. It is not until he sees truly sees reality that he decides to act. Often or not though, this is met with mixed results. However, Haruto does carry responsibilities and follows him through. He is hardworking and cares about the well-being of others so some respect can be handed out to him. Out of the girls that Haruto meets throughout the series, Eba is a magnet for responsibility to be delivered. <br />
<br />
The duo of Haruto and Eba is also awkward to watch as they don’t seem very compatible. Haruto seems to be a guy that often keeps thoughts to himself. On the other hand, Eba is a girl with a sociable personality that speaks out her mind and often not afraid to act on her actions. Again though, these lead to mixed results similar to Haruto’s case and leaves both happy and painful scars. <br />
<br />
Among other characters in the show includes Eba’s younger sister Rin that seemingly causes mischievous trouble for the duo. It’s also silly to note that she is almost nothing like her sister. At the same time, she seems to be a pivoting factor in order to get Haruto to open his eyes to the truth that lies in front of him. Then, there’s also Nanami Yuzuki, a girl that Haruto has his eyes set on from the beginning. She is depicted as a kind and forgiving girl. At many instances, she offers advise to others but is a bit insecure to herself at times. Other girls in the show also plays their minor roles but mostly stays in the background. For Haruto though, his eyes only focuses on what he thinks is in front of him. What reality show him though is much more painful but again, he keeps it to himself. <br />
<br />
One prominent feature of the story in the series also features a main supporting male character that plays a more of a tragic role. In fact, he is more of the influence factor to Eba’s decision as well as Haruto’s. The result of that influence though leads to sorrow but also some hope for Haruto; an unfortunate feeling for hope but nonetheless. But as far as that goes, the series decides to twist around with the aspect of romance again and presents it in way to almost beyond repair. Even if a series is labeled as romance with drama and comedy, it should at least follow a straight forward plot. No, instead it decides to jump all over the place and loses focus to the point where viewers might not be sure who Haruto wants to be with. Coupled with the lackluster of a sociable personality, Haruto is a man that is both hard to be empathetic with or take pity for; emphasis on either.<br />
<br />
On the more drama side, the series also tries to make viewers feel sorry for its characters. However, it gets hard to take pity on them because the decisions they make. Sure, decisions often can result in consequences but I find the choices the characters make in this series to be outright abrupt with nonsense. It doesn’t help by the fact that the series rushes its primary plot so there’s little focus on background or character development. Instead, it focuses on Haruto and his daily life with other girls. The guy is responsible but he sure doesn’t take some of his relationships as well as such. This is especially true later on with another girl that some can see as a golden egg. Unfortunately, it&#039;s a just another egg wasted by Haruto.<br />
<br />
The comedy factor of Kimi no Iru Machi is second rated. It often tries to mix in comedy with drama at the same time but this doesn’t work out. At other times, it tries the typical and cliched misunderstandings with factors of fan service. As a fan though, I don’t feel serviced or satisfied. The dialogues spoken by most of the characters also lacks flavor. Rin is perhaps one of the more curious girls that often treats Haruto’s life as a game so her dialogues tends to add a bit of interest. For the rest of the cast though, the words often a loop of dull expressions.<br />
<br />
For a more slice of life style series though, there are some hopes. The feeling of countryside brings forth a feeling of nostalgia through most of the flashbacks played throughout the series. It gives off a sense of feeling in terms of simplicity. After all, living on the countryside is simple rather than in a big crowded city. Furthermore, there is some sense of realism in terms of relationships. Examples of this includes the consequences of a long term relationship, dealing with tragedies, and getting yourself back up afterwards from it. It can be relatable too in a sort of way especially if viewers have been in a relationship in the past or is currently in one. I just hope that you won’t make some horrible decisions as some of the characters do in this series. That’s not a pretty sight to see honestly.<br />
<br />
In terms of artwork, Kimi no Iru Machi adapts a simple style with its characters looking natural but at the same time lacking any noticeable features. There’s noting particular standing out with any of the characters. Haruto looks normal and Eba is portrayed as the typical girl with a tip of naiveness. Given the fact that Seo Kouji is involved with the project, there’s also similarity in character designs between this series and his other work, Suzuka. The backgrounds does have a trace of naturalism to it though with the dancing leaves, souring winds, and seasonal weather.<br />
<br />
For its soundtrack, Kimi no Iru Machi is amazingly mediocre. There’s almost nothing to praise about any of the VA’s performances. The main male protagonist Haruto (Yoshimasa Hosoya) seems to have tone of a mature character but his actions contradicts this. Most of the girls’ voices are typical with possibly Eba being the most outstanding with her somewhat elegant tone of voice. Music wise, the show does show some melancholy especially in regards to its flashback scenes. The OP song, “Sentimental Love” is presented with a calm tone along with traces of fan service and somewhat of hope for its characters. Its two contrasting ED songs brings forth a feeling of homesickness that seems to also walk down the memory lane. <br />
<br />
Overall, Kimi no Iru Machi proves to be a lackluster romance anime that jumped way over itself. Its ineffective writing coupled by its lack of characterization makes its frustrating to watch. If that wasn’t enough, Haruto and Eba isn’t exactly what I would call the best of couple. The message that it tries to get across never seems to reach if there was one at all. Maybe it’s something on the line of ‘the truth hurts’, ‘face the reality’, or ‘love bites’. Whatever it is though doesn’t work out right. However, it does bring forth some sense of realism with relationships that takes on a path of drama. If you decide to choose the path to watch this anime though, just be aware of what’s ahead.

    Okay this is a review for those of you have not read the manga and are walking in blindly, such as myself.<br />
<br />
Kimi no Iru Machi (A Town Where You Live) is your basic romantic anime about your main character, Kirishima Haruto, and his love interest Eba Yuzuki. They have been childhood friends for a short period of time and they really bonded when Eba came back during the later years of her high school lift to attend school and various events befall them and get in the way of the love they have for each other, the most major being the distance between where the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review114659">
        two live. Eba initially travels out to the countryside where Haruto lives but then has to go back to Tokyo, and this anime takes over from the OVA series where Haruto travels out to Tokyo to chase after Eba.<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
I was really disappointed with how quickly they moved this anime along. They were constantly jumping around between past and present and never spent more than about 2 episodes on any particular event or moment. The rate at which the relationships moved along as well was frustrating as you never really got a great grasp of what was going on and how the characters really felt. What was good about it however was the ability for the viewer to be able to relate to the situation at hand. It was a fairly good setup, just rushed.<br />
<br />
Characters: 5<br />
The way they rushed through the anime was really bad, and consequently that&#039;s how the characters have turned out. I mostly disliked all of the characters, but the one bright spark was the fact that you could relate to them in a way, regardless of the decisions they made. Kirishima Haruto is your fairly common main character, not much personality and just can&#039;t seem to let go of the main female interest. Eba Yuzuki is your typical bright, clumsy damsel in distress who needs someone around to help her all the time and to support her. Although I believe she was supposed to be a likeable character, I did not like her. To me she was just to needy and just made me frustrated with her decisions and the way she conducted herself, but I digress. Eba also has a younger sister Rin who comes into the story about halfway through. She has quite the personality as she is constatly pushing Eba and Haruto together, but I won&#039;t spoil too much about her and what goes on.<br />
<br />
Art and Music: 7<br />
The music for the anime was quite well chosen I believe, although nothing outstanding that would make you want to keep listening to it outside of the anime itself. The artworks are fairly good as well, but would&#039;ve benefited from a little more time to get that smoother texture and brighter colours in general.<br />
<br />
Overall Enjoyment: 7<br />
I did enjoy this anime even with all of its flaws. I do recommend giving it a watch, but at the same time be warned that it will feel really rushed and you will not have a lot of time to be able to appreciate the situations and get to know the characters really well. <br />
<br />
Recommendation:<br />
From what other people tell me, they say the Manga is a lot better and ads in elements of comedy, as well as goes more in depth and is a lot more enjoyable overall

    Kimi no Iru Machi takes a look at the complex nature of relationships, and human desire by focusing on a childhood romance, and the complications and obstacles that the relationship has to endure. What this anime should be applauded for, is its look at how fragile our desires can  be, and the cruelty and selfishness that come as a result of it.  Of course, this also means that the characters are often unlikable and frustrating. This isn&#039;t an anime where you really like the characters, and if anything at all, it&#039;s more of a study on the ups and downs of relationships, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review144257">
        the cruelty of love.<br />
<br />
This is to say, this isn&#039;t the kind of material that is particularly enjoyable. But that doesn&#039;t make it bad by default. Even stories that aren&#039;t enjoyable, have legitimate merit as art. Afterall, not all romance stories are happy, and often in life relationships have hurdles and don&#039;t always end with happiness. These stories certainly should be told. Where Kimi no Iru Machi fails is in the final act and the overall pacing of the story. Because the story moves too quickly, there isn&#039;t enough depth given to the the main character&#039;s choice at the end, and it leaves the audience feeling frustrated and angry with the main characters. This again, doesn&#039;t make it bad. But the Manga tackled this subject a lot more seriously, and showed the consequences for this decision, and the new hurdles that arise when choosing your desires over others happiness. <br />
<br />
Essentially, the story just leaves you feeling terrible for the person that gets hurt, and frustrated and angry with the two lead characters.  They chose their desires over everything else, despite the consequences of it effecting people beyond them. Which again is fine, but the anime doesn&#039;t really give us enough weight to the decisions being made. We don&#039;t even get to spend time with the characters after the fact to understand these consequences. And the final  blow is that they essentially sweep it all under the rug, and try to pass it off as happiness trumping over everything, despite the consequences. Which again, fine, but we needed to see those consequences to understand the impact our desires can have on others, as well as why these characters are willing to suffer these consequences to fulfill their desires. <br />
<br />
Instead of looking at the impact of the main characters actions, the character that is impacted by this the most says that her love is so strong, she&#039;ll wait for the main character if he ever breaks up with the girl that was chosen over her. This on some level, looks at the idea that we can&#039;t always choose or control our desires, even if they will never be fulfilled or reciprocated. It&#039;s the cruelty of love. But the rushed pacing makes it feel like a cheap ploy to release the main character from his actions and set up an ending that is more digestible. However, this has the opposite effect, as it makes it feel like the subject matter isn&#039;t being taken seriously enough. <br />
 <br />
Overall this anime has an interesting subject matter, but it doesn&#039;t take the time needed to properly study it.  This ultimately leaves us with a bunch of a unlikable characters, and a story that isn&#039;t particularly enjoyable. However, the story is brave in its subject matter, I just wish it was more brave in going further with it (even if it makes for an uncomfortable experience), because these stories are worth telling. I would have preferred the Anime to have pushed the uncomfortable aspects of love, and left us with an ending that makes us question our own desires. Instead it comes off like a story between two people that make bad decisions, and ultimately burn everyone down around them for the sake of their love.

    First of all, let me start this review off with a question: Do you hate indecisive characters who have trouble choosing which person they love much like the characters of “School Days” and “Kimi ga Nozomu Eien?” If the answer is ‘yes,’ then I recommend staying away from Kimi no Iru Machi. If ‘no’ or if you’re unsure, then you can decide for yourself whether you want to watch this or not.<br />
<br />
“A Town Where You Live” is a romantic drama that differs from the norm when it comes to adapting manga into anime. Most anime start right from the beginning of the manga and proceed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review114757">
        from there. I have not read the manga so I don’t know exactly where it starts relative to the rest of the story, but this anime starts from a later arc and instead uses many flashbacks to fill in the important details that happened prior to present events. This makes for some confusing switches in time periods and also results in a lack of connection to characters, especially the ones that mostly only appear in flashbacks.<br />
<br />
The story of the anime begins with Kirishima Haruto, a country boy who is moving to Tokyo as he chases after the girl he loves, Eba Yuzuki. He leaves behind his friends and one of his other former crushes as he ventures alone into the big city to start his new life and his search for Eba. With him, he has brought a necklace which he hopes to give to her. Eba is a girl who is originally from Tokyo but due to family problems, bonded with Haruto on the few occasions she visited his hometown (one time was fairly short when they were young and another time she actually lived at his house for an extended period of time). Haruto starts living with his older sister, Aoi, and soon meets several other friends who go to his new high school, like his new female neighbor Mishima Asuka and the upbeat motorcycle-riding Kazama Kyousuke. Haruto begins his new everyday high school life while continuing to be an amazing cook and, most importantly, searching for Eba.<br />
<br />
Aside from the inconsistent rhythm of the plot due to the many flashbacks which sometimes encompass entire episodes, I felt the plot also suffered from the characters&#039; personalities. Haruto (as I mentioned at the beginning) is your typical indecisive male protagonist. Because of his indecisiveness, he ends up hurting not only the girls he is involved with, but himself and a few other people connected to the girls. Eba isn’t much better. She is also very indecisive and constantly tries to push Haruto away despite it still being blatantly obvious that she still has at least some feelings. These problems accumulate throughout the course of the show and end (in my opinion) with a rather unsatisfying and unrealistic ending.<br />
<br />
As for the art, it’s unimpressive to say the least. The character designs are maybe the worst part of it as every single character’s face is just copied and pasted with a different hair style and color as well as different eye colors. Because all of their facial structures are exactly the same, every character has the same stupid looking smile (I think this is the first time I’ve genuinely disliked any anime characters’ smiles). As for the backgrounds, they are very colorful and add a lot of effect to the scenes which sometimes helps them but sometimes is overused and ends up making some scenes laughably overdramatic. By that I mean that there are only so many times when gusts of wind, lightning bugs, and sakura blossoms can show up at the perfect time before it seems to be more than a coincidence. The scenery around Tokyo and Haruto’s hometown however are much better and during the regular scenes, the scenery is much nicer and more realistic (as far as anime goes anyway).<br />
<br />
The soundtrack consists of mostly instrumental pieces that sound generic in a romantic drama. None of the tracks stand out and the OP and ED are just average as well. The voice acting is impressive though as there are several different accents which (I assume since I don’t understand Japanese) the voice actors do well. It’s definitely clear even to a westerner like me that these accents are about as different as American and British ones.<br />
<br />
Kimi no Iru Machi tries a little too hard to be a dramatic romance story. Whether it comes to the indecisive characters or the strange art style, the show just falls flat in almost every possible way and is nothing more than forgettable. I recommend skipping this or maybe trying the manga instead (I know I’m recommending something I have not read, but I would recommend starting at the beginning of the story instead of dealing with flashbacks as that seems to me like it would work a little better). Still as I said in the beginning, do not watch this if the thing you hate most in the world is indecisive characters in romance stories, because this will annoy you to no end if that is the case.

    Kimi No Iru Machi<br />
<br />
When i first time watched the first episode, i felt like i&#039;m going to watch a real romance anime, but then everything started to go a little wrong for me. Actually the beggining is making you to continue watching as long as you&#039;ll recognize every single character.<br />
<br />
Story.<br />
This anime has one of the most wonderful love stories ever. It shows how strong can be loving personality. And shows that love is stronger than any type of friendship. When friend challenges ill friend for his former girlfriend, that&#039;s really unbelievable. Actually if it was me, i would let him to die thinking that he

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173361">
        has won. The end of the storyline was wonderful, but i was hoping they would show Asuka in the end with someone handsome and made for her.<br />
<br />
Art.<br />
Can&#039;t say anything good or bad about art, i think it was ok. Because in some animes because of bad art you star to hate that anime.<br />
<br />
Sound.<br />
Everything was beautiful, and sound is not an exepction.<br />
<br />
Characters.<br />
Lead characters<br />
I don&#039;t think they were made for each other. Even though when they were together they were making the cutest scenes of the whole anime, but they were really not made for each other. I don&#039;t know. I feel like Haruto and Asuka would be wonderful couple if Haruto loved her.<br />
About Supporting characters. None of them had his/her own storyline here. Some animes also show stories and loves of supporting characters, but here no one actually deserved it, because i think everything was based on lead ones.<br />
<br />
Overall.<br />
I&#039;m really happy i&#039;ve watched this anime because i&#039;ve had 1000s of feelings watching this. <br />
9/10

    Ive watched this anime far back when it aired but today I decided to unleash my thoughts in this review here firstly the anime was a pile of trash and I am going to explain why:<br />
<br />
The way they portrayed everything was so negative and sappy that I didnt know wether to cry or laugh, it was like watching those soap operas on TV .. It felt so rushed and half assed.. In one moment you have Haruto giving up and going home with his ass between his legs and then he has this sudden realization and starts running towards , guess who, EBA to spout

          <span style="display: none;" id="review174643">
        some random shit from her house door, only to see in the window a peeking Eba with a regretfull face.. This repeated imense times troughout the anime and the Manga too.<br />
<br />
But I guess its just Seo Kouji godly writing making the highlights again.. In case you dont know this men  was the one who created Suzuka wich guess what its like Kimi no iru Machi all over again, only the characters are slightly different.. Apparently Suzuka and KNIM are even from the same freaking story line.. Fucking amazing.. Its like Seo is making fun of its audience wiggling his troll dick around like a madman <br />
<br />
But in this case its not entirely Seo´s fault.. The studio who adapted KNIM was GONZO .. One of the worst studios out there right next to Deen and Pierrot (Imo) .. And has I said above the anime was very rushed and you want to know why!? Because shrinking a 270 chapter Manga into a 12 episode anime (NOTE: EACH EPISODE HAS HARDLY 18 MIN) is fucking stupid.. An anime that had the potential to have atleast 26 episodes and then they could release 2 OVA with the aftermath to close it in a soothing way, but its Gonzo so we shouldn´t expect much.<br />
<br />
Even so its not like the Source material was good.. The story of KNIM is very infamous for its twists and forced drama.. The characters arent necessary bland and motivationless, actually quite opposite however they are so hateable for their stupid ass decisions and &quot;the power of bad writting&quot; behind that you end up like Umm what the hell? .. Midway trough Haruto forms a rivalry with a guy in the verge of dying only to accomplish his goals leaving the viewers thinking .. WOW what an asshole.. <br />
<br />
Like seriously the way that this anime takes itself is so laughable on the insight that anyone with a brain would bash it.. And despite all this I was definitely surprised that I managed to end the series, more so that I was actually entertained and fell in love with it in a weird way.. It was non-sensical and just teen drama at its best.. #BLAME SEO

Has it ever happened to you? Sitting down to write something but you can&#039;t really seem to organize your thoughts? I have no clue whatsoever as to how to approach this one.. This anime to me is as strange as the vast universe we live in and i certainly don&#039;t mean that in a good way, as you may have gathered by my rating.<br />
<br />
At first i thought there was something wrong with my neuron system, maybe my brain&#039;s wiring wasn&#039;t allowing me to enjoy this piece of art in a way that would.....Touch my soul or me strings or some other slang romance enthusiasts like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298629">
        to use every other sentence. So i went to the hospital and had a doctor check me...The results were terrifying...I was in the terminal stages of bullshit intolerance and i&#039;ve been told that this is an incurable disease but it won&#039;t affect my day to day interactions with people or animals for that matter.<br />
<br />
I left the hospital devastated, i had no fags, no money to buy some and i had parked my car 2 blocks away from the damn hospital. So as i was walking i tried to come in terms with this new disease of mine, tried to embrace it..So i thought to myself that all is not lost, i shall beat this fucker in the ass and be a normal kid again..I came back home, poured a drink and went to google, my old pal who knows everything about everyone, and suggested i should try a shock therapy..That sounded dangerous and to be honest i like a bit of danger. I&#039;m not what you&#039;d call and andrenaline junkie but i quite fancy the idea of chemicals causing my reptilian brain to go berserk.<br />
<br />
Of course this being a shock therapy wasn&#039;t a piece of cake..More like a piece of concrete falling from a 3 story building and hitting you on the head leaving you for absolutely dead.<br />
<br />
And this is where A Town Where You Live comes in...From the very first episode it attacks your senses like aids attacks your immune system and if you don&#039;t know what aids does to you, why don&#039;t ya ask Freddie Mercury how that went? Well you can&#039;t cause he&#039;s dead but anyway.<br />
<br />
And the first wave of attack comes in the form of animation..From the very first seconds the animation was like a night out at Vegas with a tablet full of acid. You are still able to see things but you see in waves of blurriness and with no sense of real focus...And of course hallucinations are a nice touch as well. What i want to say is that the animation is close to atrocious and weirdly colored and blurry and it gave me eyes herpes. The characters themselves are well drawn don&#039;t get me wrong but everything else is not good, at the very best it&#039;s basic. I&#039;m not sure if it was a copy issue or anything of that sort but it seemed wayward to me.<br />
<br />
The second wave comes in the form of the characters and the story hitting you in turns for maximum impact, maximum amounts of vomit and massive internal injuries. The story goes like this, once upon a time there was a boy named Haruto and lived with his parents in the countryside..One fateful day a girl named Yuzuki came to live with them..No it&#039;s not like that you idiots get your mind out of the gutter..She was the daughter of a friend of Haruto&#039;s father or something like that..Anyway Haruto is plain and simple an annoying twat. He treats her like crap and for no obvious reason other than him being an asshole. Sure one can make the case that Yuzu is a klutz and a helpless case who can&#039;t do anything on her own, from walking in a straight line to breathing without the help of a special committee. So Haru has to help her with everything..Keyword here being &quot;help&quot;...Simply put he is one of those guys who go after broken people so he can fix them in the hopes of them not leaving him.....So one thing leads to another and they ended up together? I&#039;m still not sure on the details but that&#039;s what happens..She then leaves for Tokyo and after some time of long distance relationshiping she found someone else.<br />
<br />
Is anyone here surprised? Nope? Well hear this and be amazed at the idiocy that this anime has to offer...Haru being a creep and a stalker among other things decided to MOVE TO TOKYO to find her...Got that?<br />
<br />
From that point on some insanily stupid stuff happen and Haru jumps from girl to girl while always being in love with Yuzu and still being an obnoxious fuck with no moral restriction whatsoever.......Other characters you say? Well yeah silly there are other characters..His hot sister being one and Yuzu&#039;s redhead hot sister as well..Oh yeah there was another one who went by the name of Kazama and he, He was a damn likable character. He was an aquaintance of Haru&#039;s sister and they became friends..And guess what? They killed him off...But before they did that they had to make him the 3rd wheel and the one Yuzu dated while in Tokyo.<br />
<br />
So animation that can kill life organisms 2 galaxies away, a story made possible by an angry teenager on drugs and characters that are as believable and relatable as Spongebob..Music and VA was....There..<br />
<br />
Now i know this review wasn&#039;t as long or as full of details as you&#039;d expect but i simply cannot put every single thing that is wrong with this anime cause the servers of the internet would explode..Do you want that? But then again i&#039;ll give this anime the pro of being at least a bit realistic..I mean people are shit and they do shitty things and they use each other to get what they want and they fuck you in the proccess..That&#039;s an unwritten rule of human relations. On that front it did well, mind you that&#039;s not saying much since most times it ditches realism for downright idiocy but at least it tried and i&#039;m a nice guy!<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t and won&#039;t reccomend this to anyone, even to people that i hate with a burning passion. But then again there are people out there with little to no sense so don&#039;t blame me, blame the world we live in and the society like everyone seems to do these days.<br />

    This is a review for Kimi no Iru Machi, the TV series that ran in 2013. Before that, 2 episodes called Tasogare Kousaten (Twilight Intersection) were released. Two OVA came after this in 2014. If you want to watch all of them, I suggest starting with Tasogare Kousaten, then this, then the 2 OVAs. Tasogare Kousanten comes a bit before this in the story, and the 2 OVAs adapt chapters that were released later on.<br />
<br />
Before I start, I would like to mention that this is another review of Kimi no Iru Machi from a manga reader. Actually, I wonder if anyone DIDN&#039;T read the manga

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182573">
        before the anime. It feels like a lot of people read the manga, heard about the anime and told their friends not to watch it afterwards.<br />
<br />
It is by far my lowest rated anime on MAL, and there is a reason for that. This anime feels lackluster. It fails in all categories to deliver a minimum of what is expected from an anime to make in enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with the story, for which I gave it a 5. The only redeeming thing about the story is that it stays the same as the source material. What is wrong about it? First, we skip all of Hiroshima to skip straight to Tokyo. You heard right, we skip a third of the manga and 90% of character development and go straight to the second part of the manga. Some of the chapters from Hiroshima were shown as flashback, but not nearly enough to understand why the events in this series are unfolding. There&#039;s also the fact that this anime wanted to cover the most chapters possible, so makes for a very rushed story with essential scenes left behind. The ending also felt incomplete, as there are a lot of things that are left unresolved in the manga at this point.<br />
<br />
The art is a 6. It was actually an 8 until Episode 12. The characters looks from the manga are well adapted, but the animation is weird. The opening is one of the parts where it looks the weirdest, and it&#039;s the only part you have to watch 12 times. The center part of the animation is usually nice, but anything that&#039;s a bit peripheral to it or in the background looks horribly rushed. The still frames are beautiful, and the ending does a nice job of blending in the author&#039;s drawings with some photography in the background. One of the finer points that bothered me were when the characters&#039; mouths stopped moving for some unexplained reason during random scenes, and black and white still frames that started showing up during the last few episodes, a lot of them in episode 12.<br />
<br />
The sound deserves a measly 3. The music felt really out of place in this. The OP and ED are terrible and fail to set the right mood, if any, for the anime. The voice acting for Haruto was nice, with a thick accent and an unpolished vocabulary, it gave a vibe similar to an &quot;redneck&quot; only a bit softer. The other VA had nothing special, and were lacking a lot of emotion during key scenes. It felt like watching two animated dolls talk to each other.<br />
<br />
As for the characters, I won&#039;t drag on it. It gets a 4 mostly because of the shortcomings of the story. The fact that they skip straight to Tokyo does not allow for any development that would have been necessary to understand the characters&#039; decision and motivations. Some of the characters, like Asukara, are briefly introduced then swept aside. Same goes for Akari and Kanzaki, that were more present during Hiroshima. Also, a certain key character that has a key role in the anime has not appeared, and it&#039;s a shame because it explains a lot of things between Haruto and Asuka. Introducing it would probably not have given it enough time to make it to a conclusion within 12 episodes, so I can understand its absence.<br />
<br />
The last criteria is enjoyment, which got a 3. I feel like this is really brought down by the fact that I expected an anime that would be as enjoyable as its source material, which it was not. It is not the first time that I watched an anime based on a manga I already read, but it&#039;s the first time I am so disappointed with it. I usually like romantic stuff, both comedy and drama, but what I got here was useless drama and akward scenes.<br />
<br />
Overall it deserves a 4. It is an anime adaptation, but it&#039;s most certainly not a good one. It does have some novelty elements but it is far outhweighed by the overall lack of quality. If you read the manga, you don&#039;t need to watch this, and you&#039;ll be happier if you don&#039;t. If you haven&#039;t but like seinen, romance and drama, pick up the manga instead.

    Disclaimer: I am not reviewing the manga, nor will I be basing this review on the accuracy of this story when compared to the source material, I am simply writing a review for the anime. <br />
<br />
Now obviously, the very nature of reviews are anecdotal, but I hope that you will bypass all the other reviews that rate this show low, because to be frank people are f**king idiots and incredibly biased, don&#039;t listen to them, listen to me, the smart one. Okay, now that we have that out of the way, lets begin the review. <br />
 <br />
Reasons You Should Watch This Show: The realism of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236943">
        the relationships and situations portrayed in this series consisting of only 12 episodes and 4 OVA&#039;s are relatable and thought provoking. If you&#039;re anything like me you try to find as much meaning in a story as possible, and in my opinion the best selling point of this anime is in the way the story is told, and the ability to sway your emotions throughout the anime, as well as make you question the actions taken by the characters and whether or not they are the wrong or right ones; the ones you would take had it been you in their situation.<br />
<br />
Story: The story isn&#039;t perfect, but it&#039;s far from bad. The story consists of the MC trying to figure out his heart and the lengths he&#039;s willing to go for the girl he loves. I really enjoyed the concept of the story and the amount of meaning that can be found within the plot. One issue some people had is that the story was a bit rushed compared to the manga, and to a certain extent I agree that at times it did feel rushed, but nothing too bad. 7/10<br />
<br />
Characters: One of the best parts of this show is the characters, as the story goes on all of the major characters are developed. As they get older they act different towards each other and show their feelings differently. Just like most anime&#039;s though, the MC makes a lot of stupid decisions that could have easily been avoided, and although the characters are great, due to the 12 episode run time you miss out on a lot of potential character development. Imo though, I think this anime did the best job it could do on developing characters within such a short period. In addition you have 4 OVA&#039;s focused on tying up loose ends and providing extra backstory. 9/10<br />
<br />
Sound/Music: The soundtrack written by Keiichi Oku fits the atmosphere nicely and there are plenty of great songs that stand out in their own right. The OP and ED are bomb as well. As far as voice acting goes, the Japanese actors did a phenomenal job portraying their characters. 8/10<br />
<br />
Visuals/Animation: The art is very unique and is very pretty at times, though I noticed that the animation can be lazy. For example, they won&#039;t animate the characters talking if it&#039;s at the end of a sentence and the camera pans back to them. If you are familiar with the Monogatari series, the animation is very similar but not as &quot;edgy&quot;. 8/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Overall I related a lot with the main character and the decisions he ended up making. I really enjoyed the way the story was told, it was predictable at times but it also had a lot of unpredictable moments that had me eager to watch the next episode to find out what would happen. If you&#039;re into romance and are looking for something to relate to, this anime is for you.   <br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
Characters: 9/10<br />
Sound/Music: 8/10<br />
Visuals/Animation: 8/10 <br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
<br />
Final Rating: 8/10

    I know a lot of people say to read the manga because it&#039;s &quot;better&quot;, but it&#039;s for good reason.<br />
<br />
People who haven&#039;t read the manga may see us as some original source elitists, but you will never be able to experience everything the mangaka had to offer and his style of writing drama, through an the anime that plows through entire arcs within episodes.<br />
<br />
The manga was like a roller coaster of feels that spanned through years of years of Haruto&#039;s life. However, the anime is just like a compiled highlight reel of all of that, and because of it, the effect is not as great.<br />
<br />
Kimi no

          <span style="display: none;" id="review231830">
        iru machi is a manga that a lot of other &quot;romance&quot; and &quot;harem series don&#039;t really like to go through. It goes through relationships and breakups until he finds the one who he really feels that completes his life. This is shown through spanning arcs in the manga and you can really feel the sense of living his life as he goes through highschool, moving, graduating, and then living on his own.<br />
<br />
Sadly, the anime only has 12 episodes and it becomes difficult to capture that sense of time passing by.<br />
<br />
Finally, I&#039;m not saying NOT to watch the anime, but it would be great if you all gave the manga a chance. I&#039;ve read the manga twice and it made go through a variety of emotions and sometimes making me flip tables literally xD. I feel like it would be fun to share that same experience, so that&#039;s why I took the time to write this up!<br />
<br />
Happy reading everyone!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

    Kimi No Iru Machi or A Town Where You Live in English is a 13-episode anime series adapted from a manga. Our main protagonist something year old Haruto Kirishima transfers to Tokyo in pursuit of childhood friend and girlfriend Eba Yuzuki. Eba unexpectedly leaves Haruto’s home town Hiroshima and after a short while broke up with Haruto for unknown reasons, Haruto eventually tracks down Eba and demands an explanation for breaking up.<br />
<br />
That’s about as much of the story I can give away without spoiling it. A Town Where You Live was released back in the summer of 2013 and was the last series of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review131013">
        summer line up that I wanted to watch. I only read the story briefly and I just assumed it would be a complicated love triangle, turns out I was right. So let’s go in to some detail.<br />
<br />
When watching the first episode I was drawn in entirely by the character designs and animation, it was very shiny and a visual treat for the eyes. I thought that regardless of the story the visuals would make up for it. I was wrong. The story is clichéd and soap oriented which made it hard to watch at times. (A soap is a weekly television drama for those who don&#039;t know)<br />
<br />
Then comes the god-awful characters that mess up the show entirely for me (with the exception of a few) I will start off with the biggest and main problem of the series which is Eba Yuzuki, she is undoubtedly the worst female character I have ever had the displeasure of watching for over 4 hours. Not only is she the dullest, most mind numbingly boring females leads I have ever seen, she is also one of the biggest bitches in this show! (Granted it was only her and her step-sister)<br />
<br />
We also have our main protagonist Haruto, who needs a slap to help him get over his simplistic and shitty ex-girlfriend. Haruto has a common personality; he just seems like your common everyday nice guy, who is also lucky enough to get the attention of a few female characters in the show, but never acts on it. He has good cooking skills and his friends encourage him to become a chef, though he see’s cooking as more of a hobby. (Essentially, he&#039;s a boring twat)<br />
<br />
Other mentionable characters include Kyouske Kazama a very cheerful guy who dreams of becoming a motorbike racer. His dreams are unlikely to happen because of his illness. (Anaemia) Kazama became friends with Haruto after giving Haruto some words of inspiration and encouragement not to give up on the woman he loves. Haruto finds out later that Kazama is dating Eba and the two begin a rivalry to win over Eba, the two are still very good friends though.<br />
<br />
Finally we have Asuka Mishima who is Haruto’s neighbor when he moves to Tokyo to live with his sister. She and Haruto first met when a misunderstood Asuka thought he was a thief and attacked him with a baseball bat. The two eventually became friends and later began to date one another. <br />
<br />
I don’t know whether the creator does it intentionally to make the two main characters so unlike-able. The main character is incredibly plain and generic. The supporting cast does a much better job; they are much more easy to relate to and have at least some desirable character traits. <br />
<br />
Probably the greatest thing about this show was the animation. I mean Wow! When looking back at Gonzo’s previous work like Saikano or Full Metal Panic you can just see the drastic change in beauty. The one thing you cant fault about this series is the animation. <br />
<br />
The sound of this anime was good I was content with the plate of music put in front of me, the opening theme is very good and I didn’t feel compelled to skip it after so many episodes. The ending theme was also likeable but I skipped it every now and then.<br />
<br />
The reasons why I felt that this series was bad because of its mundane characters, overuse of a love-triangle storyline and the flawed execution. This series was not trying to attempt anything new, the pacing of the series was not to the right standard which can annoy the viewer and the only redeeming quality of this anime was the animation. This series was likeable at times with moments such as: the relationship between Haruto and Asuka plus the rivalry/friendship between Haruto and Kazama. Sadly those moments were insignificant on the train wreck that was ‘A Town Where You Live’.<br />
<br />
Overall I did not like this anime it has one redeemable feature (animation style) that is not worth watching for this shitty, overused and stereotypical love triangle/love dilemma that occurs within this show. I would not recommend this to anyone unless they are fans of drama/romance genres. This show deserves a score of 5/10.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading guys <br />

    Highly underrated and misunderstood Anime. 9/10 in my personal opinion. Recommended for people that don&#039;t want a typical cliche humor romance, but something more realistic with a deeper meaning.<br />
<br />
This will be an analytical interpretation of the story and thoughts passing through each character. I suffered from a lot of trauma (PTSD) in my life and have a very deep psychological understanding of sorrow, hope, despair, grief, depression and various other complex emotions and most importantly: LOVE.<br />
<br />
SPOILERS INCLUDED.<br />
<br />
The most highlighted emotion in this anime is that of true love. I am not talking about a simple crush like you have on someone you find attractive. This

          <span style="display: none;" id="review341896">
        is the kind of love that you&#039;ll only experience once in your life if you are lucky enough (I for one was lucky enough). Your sense of logic and kindness gets overwritten by the deep desire to grasp that love that you lost, once more and this time hold on to it as tight as you can. It&#039;s the kind of love that will make you lose all reason. It&#039;s the kind of love that will fill your heart with pure bliss and turn your mind into a permanent happy drug. It&#039;s the kind of love that is impossible to understand unless you experienced it.<br />
<br />
I hope this explanation of what true love is, helps you understand my analysis better.<br />
<br />
Haruto is your run-off-the-mill typical high school student. Nothing special about him in the beginning, except that he has a crush on a high school girl. Then he stumbles upon his fateful encounter as a kid, but is unaware of what that means for his future life. He then meets his fated love in form of Yuzuki Eba during high school but forgot about her (pretty stupid plot flaw at this point as such an encounter is highly memorable, but let&#039;s give him the benifit of doubt).<br />
<br />
She (Yuzuki Eba) invades his fairly boring life with so much energy, that he has no choice but to fall head over heels in that loveable person. Why is she so energetic though? Such coincidence is miraculous on paper, but she herself already fell in love with him at young age and that memory stuck with her as one of her happiest (very important for the plot development).<br />
<br />
Sidestep into Yuzuki&#039;s life: Yuzuki returns to Tokyo after her childhood memory with Haruto. Get&#039;s mentally tormented by her younger sister. This kind of torment turns her entire psyche into a mess. At this point she is full of despair and pities herself, believing she is unwanted. The Kyousuke comes into the picture as the white knight that saves her from her misery. Slowly she accepts his kindness and sees him as a true friend that is too kind to be true (this is very real for someone that is suffering deeply, anyone that is remotely kind is idolized). He falls in love with her, she rejects him, but feels terrible for doing so.<br />
<br />
Back to main story: Yuzuki is a lot more cheerful after being saved from misery and back together with the person she truly loves, Haruto. He then also notices that he is deeply in love with her too, but then ugly destiny pitches into their beautiful love and makes their life an entire utter mess. Kyousuke is the most to blame for this mess, although he is a good guy at heart with no ill intentions.<br />
<br />
From the Anime itself it is unclear if Kyousuke indirectly blackmailed Yuzuki with his illness and abusing her weak and kind heart to give in to his desires. However, it is clear that Yuzuki feels terrible for the person that saved her from her weakest state and feels like she owes him all he desires, since his own life is about to run out.<br />
<br />
Here on out the misunderstandings of the viewers occurs: &quot;Yuzuki treating Haruto like trash and rejecting him&quot;. This statement is as wrong as can be. What really happens is: Yuzuki rejects Haruto because she is extremely confused. Not only that, but she is too kind of a person to let her &quot;white knight&quot; (Kyousuke) suffer any more than he already does, so she gives in to giving him the mutual love he desires (but it&#039;s fake love). Yuzuki isn&#039;t at fault here, she has no ill intentions at all and hopes it&#039;s the correct choice.<br />
<br />
Kyousuke dies and now the REAL mess begins. Haruto lost a great friend, Yuzuki lost her saviour and good friend. Both of them are mentally broken at this point. Both of them drown in an ocean of despair and sorrow. The love they shared is lost in their extremely messy psyche.<br />
<br />
Both of them are highly vulnerable at this point. Any kind of affection will give them comfort. Yuzuki probably gets the affection of her younger sister, because her younger sister starts to feel bad for her (this isn&#039;t clear in the anime but the best interpretation I have). <br />
<br />
And Asuke who always had a crush on Haruto, finally makes a move on him in his most vulnerable state. He takes it as a substitute love, but it&#039;s truly just a substitute to his true love. Asuka may be genuine about the love, she is fairly simple and probably also seeks comfort after the loss of her seemingly best friend Kyousuke. And so Haruto and Asuka intertwine in a mostly onesided and fake relationship. While on surface the relationship they have looks like they make a cute couple, Haruto still suffers deeply from losing so many things along the line.<br />
<br />
Haruto got driven into so many corners, that he can&#039;t act like a nice person anymore and stops caring about trying to make everyone happy. So instead he pursues his own dream of reclaiming his one and only true love. <br />
<br />
Yuzuki finally having dealt with all her past issues, can now let her heart roam freely and thus inevitably floating back to the only person she ever truly loved, her fated encounter: Haruto. Initially she just acts like she just wants a friendship with him (trust me, I am in a similar boat right now), but in reality she just wants to not lose Haruto anymore and get closer to him once more with the last grain of hope she has for fulfilling her love wish.<br />
<br />
Haruto becomes a scumbag towards Asuka, because loves rules over reason. If you think Haruto is just a simple asshole, you never suffered enough in your life to understand the pain he is actually going through (or okay, yes it is an anime and fictional character, so just imagine a real person like me). <br />
<br />
What do both characters suffer from? Let&#039;s name the issues and constant stress they deal with: <br />
-&gt; Heartbroken (mostly depression)<br />
-&gt; Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (leads to depression and various other terrible things)<br />
-&gt; Hopelessness (caused by the constant obstacles their relationship gets plagued with)<br />
-&gt; Distance <br />
-&gt; a few additonal minor issues that add up to the count but not worth mentioning to keep the list focused on the main issues<br />
<br />
I suffer from more than that, but less is enough to drive them insane in their rational mindset. So ofcourse Haruto can&#039;t play Mr. Niceguy towards Asuka anymore and the pre-doomed fake relationship they had together comes to an obvious end. Asuka doesn&#039;t deserve to be treated like that, but there is no helping his attitude. Many viewers are probably aggrevated for Haruto&#039;s behaviour towards Asuka, especially when he lies all the time. Rather than hating him tho, pity him instead. He is suffering so much, that he feels like he needs to lie to one of his most precious people in life. <br />
<br />
Then after their breakup, Haruto feels terrible about himself and Yuzuki notices that Haruto is severely hurt and highly vulnerable once again from having to break the heart of Asuka. The pain he suffers at that point is immeasurable and extremely hard to put into words, just imagine staring into eternal emptiness.<br />
<br />
After coming clean with Asuka, he can finally pursue his dream of fulfilling his deepest desire once again: Come together with Yuzuki one final time and enjoy their long awaited mutual and beautiful true love.<br />
<br />
The ending and how it&#039;s displayed in a tone of despair with a dark rainy mood setting at the end really shows that true love comes with a price when so much shit got between you and your true love. <br />
<br />
People that understand this kind of psychological aspect of the characters, can really respect the author for trying his best at displaying such realistic and beautiful love to the audience without all the cliche anime garbage that floods the anime market. I am talking about all the nonsense humor that usually gets put on display in romance animes with the addition of pointless pantyshots and other fanservice.

    My review is completely my opinion. <br />
I think that the ending of the anime was really good. Kazama and Asuka, in my perspective, were 3rd persons in between Haruto and Yuzuki. And here I&#039;m not denying the fact that Kazama and Asuka loved Yuzuki and Haruto respectively. I&#039;ve not read the manga, so my review is purely based on the anime.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
This anime has one of the most wonderful love stories ever. It shows that love is stronger than any type of friendship. When a friend challenges ill friend for his former girlfriend, that&#039;s really unbelievable. Actually if it was me, I would let him have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416685">
        her and accept that he has won her. The end of the storyline was wonderful, but I was hoping they would show Asuka in the end with someone who loved her dearly.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Nothing in particular but it was good.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Everything was beautiful and very apt to the characters.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Lead characters-<br />
I think they were made for each other. I don&#039;t feel like Haruto and Asuka would&#039;ve been a wonderful couple.<br />
About Supporting characters- None of them had his/her own storyline here. Some animes also show stories and loves of supporting characters, but here no one was given a particular past. But they did a great job as side characters.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
I am very happy that I&#039;ve watched this anime and I don&#039;t hate it as some do.<br />

    This show was so frustrating to watch and I disliked some of the characters and the choices they made so strongly that I felt compelled to write my first review on here. This is really just a rant so, sorry if it sucks ig<br />
<br />
Quick Explanation of characters that I mention in case anyone cares:<br />
<br />
Haruto - Main character, used to date Yuzuki in middle school but then they broke up when she moved back to Tokyo. He then moves to Tokyo in high school to continue pursuing her.<br />
Yuzuki - Haruto&#039;s ex-girlfriend for most of the show (they get back together because of course they do)<br />
Asuka -

          <span style="display: none;" id="review408749">
        One of Haruto&#039;s friends that he makes at his new high school in Tokyo. They start dating once they enter college.<br />
Rin - Yuzuki&#039;s younger sister.<br />
<br />
Some of the decisions that Haruto makes are absolutely ridiculous and upsetting to watch. I mean, the first decision that he makes is moving all the way to Tokyo from Hiroshima in order to find out how the girl he USED TO date &quot;really feels&quot; about him. Very creepy behavior. <br />
<br />
Also, definitely don&#039;t watch this if you dislike it when &quot;lack of communication&quot; is used as a major plot point because it happens OFTEN, especially in the last half of the show. Look, I get that it can be used in an interesting way, but there are times when Haruto DOES NOT tell his new girlfriend things ON PURPOSE. And then he gets surprised when it blows up in his face!! Wow!!!!<br />
<br />
This could just be me but I think Rin was just the worst character. Her only purpose in the show was to stir up drama between Haruto, Asuka, and Yuzuki. And it was very irritating. Sometimes, shows can have purposefully antagonistic characters who do stir up drama or cause chaos in an entertaining or interesting way, but Rin just kind of sucked. It wasn&#039;t enjoyable to watch when she causes unnecessary drama that Haruto only makes worse by not telling Asuka the truth. <br />
<br />
The only thing I really liked was the opening. It was nice, but that might&#039;ve just been in comparison to the rest of the show not being very good.

    Hoo boy, is this anime not very good. First off I have to say, these last few months I have watched many many romance anime to fill the deep black void in my heart and let me tell you, this anime just straight up isn&#039;t good.<br />
<br />
Imagine, a man falls in love with a mysterious girl from Tokyo that stayed with him, then all of a sudden, after their love finally reached a peak and they shared their feelings for one another, she up and leaves. So, whats the reasonable thing to do? Follow her from hundreds of kilometres away obviously! Well guess what, that sucks,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340956">
        she has another boyfriend that she cheated on him with, and hes your best friend! So he decides to challenge his dying friend for a fight to win over his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
He dies from a failed surgery and he stops talking to her for some reason. Last time they meet up before a 2 year hiatus was to give an ex boyfriend her boyfriends dying present to him. Next thing you know, he dates an extremely sweet, innocent, naive, adorable girl, just when he thinks he gets over the girl from Tokyo, she appears again. They go to a group date, they talk a lot and reminisce about old times, all the while his girlfriend has no idea that this is happening. So, a few months pass and his girlfriend wants to go on a trip, but oh no, her grandmas back is messed up so she has to go see her. While she does that, she decides that he should go back to his hometown, with said ex girlfriend, to check on his family.<br />
<br />
A bunch of shit happens, reminiscence of old times, hanging out with friends and having a chuckle. Your ex wants to go to the festival with you, little do you know, she has an ulterior motive. Youre watching fireworks while she confesses her love to you, you reciprocate that love and embrace. Now, you actively cheats on your own sweet, innocent girlfriend, who prior, confided in you about her best friends death and you were the only one who could offer it. She fell in love with, always trusted you with everything and wanted to give you the world. But instead, you opted for childish, unrequited, and wrong love, abandoning your girlfriend, mixed up in her own feelings depressed because she still loves you.<br />
<br />
This anime was mediocre, bordering on terrible, the story is very very mediocre and just down right sad. It&#039;s supposed to be a happy ending about &quot;oh, love will always win, no matter how far apart you are or what happens&quot; but no, a lot of people got hurt. The girlfriend never deserved anything that happened to her and just wanted to give him happiness, lowkey pissed me off because she was willing to give him the world. Anyway, thats the end of my rant, not very good, not awful but not good.

    Before I start I&#039;m gonna say that I watched this anime and then read the manga afterwards.<br />
<br />
I know many, many people would say things like &quot;anime should not be compared to manga&quot; etc etc. HOWEVER, in this case I feel like this anime was a complete disgrace to the manga and mangaka himself. <br />
<br />
But get this: this anime adapted 144 CHAPTERS from the manga into 12 EPISODES. Anyone with a right mind would think that&#039;s bizarre.<br />
<br />
The anime starts at chapter 80 in the manga, and &quot;tries&quot; to make a decent story from there by making chapters 1-80 into a 2 episode flash back and then

          <span style="display: none;" id="review196192">
        going from chapter 80-144 in only 10 episodes. Because of this, from an anime only point of view, you never know why the MC even likes the main heroine in the first place, and the beginning of the anime starts at such an awkward place that it&#039;s hard to connect with how the MC is feeling. It would have been fine if this anime just started from chapter 1, so we could have a fresh start with the characters rather than starting the anime with a character that&#039;s supposed to have gone through a lot of insane development already. The flash backs barely help because it&#039;s a MUCH different experience to watch flash backs than seeing those events actually happen chronologically. To make matters worse, the ending to this anime was so dry and abrupt that it basically forces you to read the manga. Anime should be able to stand alone without a manga, right? Well this anime is simply mediocre without reading the manga.<br />
<br />
The art is actually pretty nice. The opening looks beautiful and the characters are true to their manga forms. However, sometimes the art on certain characters look off. Other than that the art is great.<br />
<br />
The characters are one of the main problems in this anime. The characters simply lack development. The set-up for this anime makes the MC look like a stalker and the main heroine look like an a** hole, but if you actually know what truly happened in chapters 1-80, you&#039;d know why the MCs act the way they do. The anime rushes development for the side characters as well due the fact that there was 144 chapters adapted into a 12 episode anime.<br />
<br />
For enjoyment, I was simply left hanging at the end. At the end of the anime, I felt like I wasted my time. The events were so weirdly scattered, and I could barely connect with the characters until, BAM, the anime was over when things started getting good. It&#039;s really sadenning for anime only watchers, cuz the manga actually goes on for another 100+ chapters after it ends at the anime, and the anime skipped tons of chapters from the beginning. It&#039;s simply a mess.<br />
<br />
I would ONLY recommend watching this anime if you have read the entire manga already. I only consider this anime as eye-candy, meaning that I would only watch this to see how the manga would look animated. And it&#039;s definitely not bad in the animation/art department. But storywise, this anime is just mediocre at BEST. The manga is a masterpiece that should have gotten a true anime adaptation. Sadly most animes nowadays are just &quot;trailers&quot; for the manga, and this anime is a perfect example of that.

    So, where to begin with, after a good dose of sleep and reflection about Kimi no Iru Machi (A town where you live), I’ve been able to flush this huge dissatisfaction of mine. So today, I’ve decided to write a review of Kimi no Iru Machi, which through my opinion, deserves criticism for its overall entity.<br />
<br />
Let’s have a review:<br />
It’s plot is  said to be portrayed  as drama and romance, however ,this is not it! Yes it depicts slice of life; however, this one is rather characterized as tragic romance.  Here, the plot is a retrospective one whereby it moves from the present

          <span style="display: none;" id="review149073">
        to the past from time to time, yet it gives no time for the viewer to adapt to this gigantic melancholic scenario. Kimi no Iru Machi, is a typical love story where the main character Haruto Kirishima principally has a crush on a girl Kanzaki Nanami but at the same time spends most of his time with his childhood friend Eba Yuzuki whom he disliked at first. As the anime progresses those two friends developed in terms of relationship but broke up as Eba Yuzuki went back to the city of Tokyo. Haruto sets on a quest to find her in Tokyo but meets with new acquaintances. There is more than this. Personally, this anime deserves a 5 for its story line whereby I could not find any such happiness in the atmosphere surrounding the main characters. This anime fails to develop primarily due to its 12 episodes show.<br />
<br />
Aesthetically speaking, the anime is directed with a high sense of realism. The characters are drawn with a touch of realism so does the background. There is nothing spectacular about this anime as its effect give a sense of uneasiness, coldness and fluster the viewer with frustration. Nevertheless, one positive point is that, the production has been able to demonstrate, though slightly, the difference of atmosphere of the countryside and the city. Kimi no Iru Machi deserves a 5.5 for its well drawn characters and atmosphere; however this rating does not go beyond that. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, this anime does not propel the viewer to something deep and enjoyable through its music. As for me, I skipped the Opening song as well as its ending while watching this anime progression because I was crammed with frustration.<br />
<br />
Finally it comes to the characters. I despise both Haruto Kirishima and Eba Yuzuki for their irresponsible attitude towards each other as well for other characters of the anime. Besides, for it only 12 episodes show, it gives no time for the viewer to create a bond with any specific character except for one, namely Asuka Mishima. As for Rin Eba, another likeable character from my opinion, deserves an A+ for the way she treats Haruto. <br />
<br />
Well, well,  my opinion may be bias by personal experience however I dislike this character for his irresponsible attitude towards his ex girlfriend Eba Yuzuki and Asuka Mimishima. There is nothing spectacular with this typical guy whose main concern is about mundane things. He acts impulsively and never measures the weight of his acts. What I dislike the most is that he find hopes in the end of the anime, though one may be happy for him, this character lacks maturity in decision making and acts like a spoil teenage guy.<br />
<br />
Eba Yuzuki, is the main protagonist, also characterized as a typical girl that has nothing extra ordinary but it still through her charm and beauty makes people attracted to her. However, personally, I dislike her because of her helplessness of making the right decision. Though being a joyous character, she acts like nothing matters and complicates everything. Both Yuzuki and Haruto make this anime frustrating to watch as they dull the atmosphere which from my point of view creates sadness  but yet they reject what other characters think of them. Finally those two do not fit each other because I could not find happiness in the end and again they fail to arouse the sympathy of the viewer. For me the characters(especially Haruto and Yuzuki) merit a 5 except for Asuka Mishima and Rin Eba who gladly meet my expectation and so are given a rating of 8.<br />
<br />
Hmmmm, by reading this, you might already note my level of enjoyment, Kimi no Iru Machi has only generated the negative sides of my thoughts. My heart ached while watching this anime and has spoiled my entire day. Maybe for that I’ll give it a 5 because it has been able to leave a scar in my memory. Nevertheless, nevertheless, in overall, I’ll give this anime a 4 out of hatred.<br />

    This anime was an interesting one to say the least. It had many flaws but also many pros that made it an enjoyable one to watch.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story of this anime was good, but in my opinion, it lacked clarity. Often throughout the anime, you find yourself confused or puzzled in regards to what is actually happening. Constantly, there are flashbacks that generally complicated the story and ultimately made it hard to follow. In my opinion, i did not hate the story. Instead, i quite enjoyed it despite the countless flaws that were present. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Many can criticize the animation by saying that the characters and setting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review156361">
        were poorly drawn. However, i could argue otherwise because i honestly believe that the animation in this anime was not bad. Although, there were many parts that were terribly done, i would still say that the art was not bad. If i were to give my honest opinion, i would say that the art was fair. There was nothing special as the anime contained simplistic animations and ordinary color use.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
This was probably the best thing the show had going for it. Oddly enough, i quite enjoyed the music and sounds used within this anime. I felt as though the producers used music/sounds effectively draw out a particular mood within the anime. <br />
<br />
Character:<br />
The characters were good, but was not excellent. At times, it is seen that the characters lacked substance. In other words, it can be seen that the producers rushed the development of the characters resulting in dull and vague personalities. Personally, i did not mind the characters, but i do feel as though they could have been developed more. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I could honestly say that i enjoyed this anime, despite all its flaws. There were easily more cons than pros in this anime, but even so, the anime was one that was quite amusing to watch.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
As a final statement, i can say that this was a good anime. To anyone who enjoys watching anime that involves romance then this is definitely one that is worth checking out. After watching this anime, i can honestly recommend it to everyone as it was one that was quite enjoyable.<br />

    Spoilers at the end. I&#039;ll make this short and straight to the point. I despise this anime. I only like two characters in it and one of them was supporting. The ending was beyond the realm of dreadful. They should just rename this to &quot;School Days 2.&quot; Yes, the ending was that bad. The MC is about as interesting and as smart as the many craps I took while watching this. Oh, also, about 3 episodes are SOLELY flashbacks. I found myself skipping over them too, because they held no relevance to the plot. While they gave an idea as to the relationship between the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221472">
        MC and his female dog of a crush, they also served no purpose and could easily have been cut out without confusing the watcher. It has good art, but that&#039;s all. It&#039;s a waste of time to even fully review this garbage. Save yourself a few hours and don&#039;t watch this wreck of an anime.<br />
<br />
(SPOILERS) [+Large Your Lie In April spoiler]<br />
<br />
Oh, by the way. Did I mention how the MC&#039;s new best friend stole the MC&#039;s girlfriend from him unknowingly, and that the MC challenged said best friend to get her back? Yeah, also, best friend is dying and has surgery so that they can try to have an &quot;even&quot; playing field, but guess what? They pull a your lie in April and the surgery fails. You know what they do after that? Timeskip. Oh, and he suddenly forgot his original crush and dates the MUCH more likeable character, only for original crush to come back and ruin everything. Long story short, he breaks up with the perfect girl he had for Ms. &quot;I broke up with you for a guy after hearing he was dying but now that he&#039;s dead i love you again&quot; <br />
(END OF SPOILERS)<br />
<br />
Seriously. I despise this. I&#039;m not even going to give each category a rating, you can just look at these and assume what i would say.<br />
<br />
Story: 2<br />
Art: 7<br />
Sound: 4<br />
Character: 1 <br />
Enjoyment: 2 (For Asuka.)<br />

    Kimi Ni Machi Iru is a finely paced romance about Haruto, the protagonist, searching and hoping to reunite with an old flame. The audience is strung along the main characters quest as he tries to reconnect with his long lost love, with many questions, secrets, trials and tribulations along the way. Romance stories, or at least good ones, are always roller coasters to say the least and usually are always told in the same way. However, Kimi Ni Machi Iru finds its way to reuse the old methodology and turn it into a new refreshing tale of love. Watching the main characters journey unfold is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review128549">
        definitely worth watching. <br />
<br />
Story: 8.3 -<br />
The story isn&#039;t innovative by any means, and it usually revolves around the same concept. A good way to compare Kimi Ni Machi Iru is like comparing it to a Korean Drama show. They always tell it the same way, but it is how they use it, is the key to success. Throughout the story, there are well placed literary devices (symbolism/foreshadowing/irony etc.) and without a keen eye, one could miss out on a completely well developed scene.<br />
<br />
Animation: 8.5 -<br />
The art direction definitely has a stylized theme to it, from hues or rather colors depicting the mood and setting of the situation or scene to, warm, calming and serene pastel like colors. Oftentimes, there is no attention to detail, which can be confusing and the question of why it couldn&#039;t have just been consistent arises, however overall, it does deserve an honorable mention.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8.3 -<br />
The characters are probably the hardest thing to rate in Kimi Ni Machi Iru, and it&#039;s definitely going to be opinionated. Each character in the story are very like-able and most likely the audience will end up choosing their favorites (Here comes the rage!). Get ready to see the males name x females name on youtube or comment posts, although the story is most likely predetermined. The characters display their emotions quite vividly, which is also complemented with the art &amp;amp; animation, which can be truly taxing on the soul. These characters deliver a very realistic and very human emotions, that often the viewer can definitely relate to, even if sometimes we might not agree with from a story standpoint or perspective. <br />
<br />
Wow Factor: 8.5 -<br />
Kimi Ni Machi Iru does not disappoint and will keep the audience quite amused/engaged until the very end or perhaps just the opposite, to people who compare it to the manga. The story and its characters in it will take you for a heart felt, possibly tear jerking melodramatic journey that is absolutely worth a watch.<br />
<br />
Final Grade: 8.4 / 10 - &amp;gt; 8 (Anime List)<br />
+ Good use of Literary Devices (Used in story telling, ex: Foreshadowing, Symbolism etc.)<br />
+ Good use of flash backs<br />
+ Opening Intro &amp;amp; Song (MIMI MEME MIMI - Sentimental Love)<br />
<br />
- Sometimes too easy to read &amp;amp; generic of whats to come<br />
- More consistency with the Art style<br />
<br />
