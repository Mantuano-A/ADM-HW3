<br />
Sumomomo Momomo.. an anime that for 21 and 9/10 episodes I liked... and was prepared to put this into my list of one of my more favorite romantic comedies.  But I was horribly let down.  And I am pissed off about it!  Why!?  Well I guess you&#039;ll have to read on!<br />
<br />
The premise is pretty simple and in typical anime fair, ridiculous but cute in its own way.  Momoko&#039;s father having told her that she will never be able to master her families martial arts clan signature move, must go seek out the strongest man and make strong

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9220">
        offspring!  To which Momoko replies, &quot;Hai!&quot;  I found this pretty humorous at the start of each episode.  Though this is a bit of a falsehood since we learn shortly that Momoko&#039;s father and Koushi&#039;s have made a prearrange marriage for the two of them to unite the martial arts world and keep peace.  While this seems to be an interesting premise on the surface the story never really develops this concept, beyond different factions sending assassins to kill Koushi.  There is even a scene towards the middle of the series where several female martial artists unknown to the story up to then make comments about making him their husband but then we never hear from them again.  Other characters also appear seemingly having more to offer the story and then just as quickly vanish without any explanation. I do give the story a good rating though solely on a couple of arcs that are pretty interesting and funny.<br />
<br />
With the exception of Koushi (more on him later) I give Sumomomo&#039;s characters a very good rating.  Momoko , Iroha, and Sanae are great.  The series does a great job in developing their personalities and backgrounds, though Momoko&#039;s back story is surprisingly weak compared to the other two female leads.  The show does a good job at keeping the cast at a minimum for the most part, which is a good thing.  A lot of shows allow themselves to be bogged down with huge numbers of characters that take away from the development of the mains.  I fell in love with all three of the girls, especially Momoko (who couldn’t love her!).  Hanzo was also very funny as was the appearances by the old landlady who provided a lot of laughs in her search for rent money or her bizarre training of Sanae.<br />
<br />
Now on to the bad of the characters.. Koushi.  Momoko’s love, she devotes herself totally to him, unselfishly protecting him from assassins, cooking and cleaning for him, unconditional love.. like a puppy.  Regardless of how cruelly she is treated in return.  Koushi&#039;s reject on her is pretty funny, especially of her more outlandish behavior (like pulling a futon out of nowhere to make babies), at first.  But the show beats this over and over and over again until it starts to become unfunny and starts to just be mean.  Koushi comes off, well like an asshole.  While sometimes he seems to have feelings for her, it is completely forgotten 5 minutes later and was back to where we started.  So for a show that is supposed to be a romance as well as comedy there is really zero development on this plot point.  He also is wimpy, hides behind girls the entire show, and seems to be selfish and the only time he seems to have any genuine concern about someone else is when his own skin is in danger and not having that person around means he’s getting his butt kicked.  Why Momoko, Iroha, or Sanae want to protect him or even like him baffles me at times.  By the end of the show I find myself thinking that Momoko should have just let the jerk die.<br />
<br />
The art is pretty good, the show uses &quot;chibi&quot; style animation a lot, which is a favorite of mine and it does it well enhancing the comedy in a number of places.  Though the non-chibi models of Momoko and Iroha are a bit too small for their supposed ages and them come off a little too loli like and is a bit creepy sometimes.  I am a big Aya Hirano fan and her voice for Sanae is great, the other acting is good too, though I think Momoko&#039;s voice sometimes doesn’t fit all of the time.  The songs are a mixed bag too, the first opening song is pretty good but the rest are fairly mediocre.<br />
<br />
Overall I did like this show for the most part, and I was going to give it a rating of 8.  But did I mention that ending?  Yeah, it was that bad IMO.  If you thought all of Momoko&#039;s hard work and feelings was going to be accepted and end in a satisfying emotional reward, well um not really.  Just when you think you’re about to get the payoff, your let down.  It’s like going to a cake shop and seeing this wonderful looking cake and buying it and then when you taste it finding out that it doesn’t taste as good as it looked.  The show has a lot of funny things in it and maybe for a lot of people you will probably not mind the end as much as I did.  But if you in any way like to see a show wrap up with real endings that show something did change from episode 1 to the final, then you will probably be disappointed in it as well.<br />

    The thing about Sumomo mo Momo mo is that for the first few episodes you&#039;re convinced that it&#039;s all just loli fan service and hilarious chibi jokes. In fact, even up to episode 14, that&#039;s still fairly accurate. But saying just that doesn&#039;t really cover everything that the series is. <br /><br />STORY:  8 out of 10<br /><br />The plot is basically that Inuzuka Koushi and Kuzuryuu Momoko, the respective heirs to their martial arts family bloodlines, are arranged to be married in order to maintain peace among the Zodiac families. Momoko, heir to the Dragon line and an awesome martial artist, is seriously excited about marrying Koushi,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review123">
        but Koushi, heir to the Dog line and a terrible fighter who just wants to be a lawyer, isn&#039;t exactly thrilled. Assassin&#039;s that oppose the marriage try to kill Koushi, noting that he&#039;s the weak link of the two. Simple, silly plot line. However, the story develops in such a way that we learn more about each of the characters involved without really losing relevance to the overall story that often. Filler episodes aren&#039;t common (though they do exist), but when they crop up, they are at least funny.<br /><br /><br />ANIMATION:  7 out of 10<br /><br />This series isn&#039;t the prettiest to look at, both in matters of animation and style (that&#039;s without mentioning the fantastically ridiculous cg). However, the character designs are cute, and the animation is at least utilized in an effective manner. One thing in particular I like is that they didn&#039;t cut animation costs by making the characters talk out of the sides of their mouths when they&#039;re in profile --- their mouths and jaw&#039;s actually open! Kudos for that, at least. <br /><br /><br />SOUND:  8 out of 10<br /><br />The first OP and ED are both catchy as hell once you get used to how cracked out they are, and the background music serves it&#039;s purpose in mood setting. I have yet to decide whether I like the new OP and ED, though, because I was so attached to the first ones.<br /><br /><br />CHARACTER:  10 out of 10<br /><br />Yes, I know the series has tons of fan service. But underneath that, you see that the characters are more than just fan service/comedy machines. Despite thier ridiculousness, their storylines manage to make you care deeply for thier troubles, and wish the best for them. For example:  Though Hanzo has every chance to take advantage of Iroha (who he is obviously attracted to), he doesn&#039;t. He&#039;s older, larger, and lives alone with her, and yet he respects, fears, and adores her for who she is. Even though you need to peel back the layer of anime humor to see this, it&#039;s still there. <br /><br /><br />ENJOYMENT:  10 out of 10<br /><br />Definitely one of the most fun series I&#039;m currently watching. Not only is it hilarious, it can also be surprisingly touching. A good, lighthearted series. In my book, a show needs only to achieve it&#039;s goals to be successful, and in that, Sumomo definitely passes.<br /><br />OVERALL:  9 out of 10<br /><br />Definitely recommended for anyone who can get past the fan service long enough to see this series worth.

    This is my first review, so yoroshiku onegaishimasu :)<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t remember how I came across this anime, I think it was because it was tied to To LOVE-Ru because it has a similar setup. Anyway, I was very very very skeptical about how this anime was going to turn out. I came out of the first episode thinking, meh, that wasn&#039;t horribly interesting or engaging. But one day I got bored, and I mean REALLY bored, so I thought &amp;quot;what the heck, I&#039;m feeling like something stupid and ecchi&amp;quot;. That really is all it seems like at first, but as the story develops, the characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5802">
        and the plot become strangely addicting, simplistic as they may be.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
<br />
It isn&#039;t the greatest or most original story. Kuzuryu Momoko&#039;s father made an agreement with Inuzuka Koushi&#039;s father (both being martial artists) that their children would marry to &amp;quot;produce the strongest offspring&amp;quot;. When I saw this line 2 minutes into the show, I thought &amp;quot;you&#039;ve got to be kidding me...&amp;quot; Sure, there is the whole predicament with loads of martial artists battling over the fate of Japan, but since you don&#039;t see enough of that, it becomes virtually irrelevant in the plot. That doesn&#039;t seem to matter, however, as the plot always stays engaging in some sense or another. Mainly what you see are the funny interactions between Koushi and Momoko, and how other girls play into this affection towards Koushi. He pays most of them no heed, except for one. Expect many love webs, basically. All in all, the plot is not horribly complex, but it is refreshingly simple.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
<br />
I very much disliked the art in the beginning of the anime. Whenever I start to watch an anime with unfamiliar eye styles, I get thrown off. This was one of the reasons behind me dropping the show, but after I watched more of it, I began to get used to it. It annoys me how Momoko looks 10 years old, but whatever. Besides that, the art is very... average. Nothing astounding, but that&#039;s not what&#039;s great about this anime.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
<br />
Again, nothing special here, just your average sound effects. The first OP really annoyed me at first, but now its so catchy that I can&#039;t get it out of my head... noooooo. Anyway, just expect the usual here.<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
<br />
At first all the characters seemed very... well, stereotypical. The sound, art, and story were, so I wasn&#039;t expecting much from the characters. However, as more and more people are introduced into the plot and you learn more about the past, you get to know the characters very well, and begin to favorite or despise certain people. I find myself getting into each episode, even if its a filler, and usually each character has enough screen time so that you can get to know them, which is refreshing.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
<br />
I was VERY surprised at how addictive this anime became. With a somewhat interesting plot, average sound, and OK art, you would think the enjoyment would go along the same path. You, my friend, can join me in the world of People who were Wrong about Enjoyment Values of Certain Animes (Pretty neat world, really).<br />
Anyway, back to the main point. There is rarely an anime that makes me literally laugh out loud. Naruto re-uses the same jokes, Bleach was never horribly funny. But sometimes this show will throw something at you with such great timing and humor that you can&#039;t help but laugh. Some of the moments on this show are so priceless, especially when you aren&#039;t expecting them. Of course, there is also the ecchi part of this anime that falls under the enjoyment factor. Lots of situations like this happen almost every episode, and its this that bonds the anime together. Not like that&#039;s a problem though; every episode is great, and I don&#039;t find myself asking &amp;quot;is this a filler? I hate those things...&amp;quot; Every filler stands up for its name: It really does fill the space with quality material.<br />
<br />
Sumomomo Momomo proves that it&#039;s not the action that makes the anime: It&#039;s how much it can engage you, and draw you in with something unique. It truly has this special uniqueness, although it may be a bit cliche. The characters are what this is really about; when you know everyone well, you can really understand why each situation is played out the way it is, and the characters never do something unusual or without a reason. Sumomomo Momomo is definitely one of the most under-rated animes, and with such great enjoyment and character values, it deserves more time in the spotlight. Give it a try, don&#039;t get thrown off by the first few episodes. Enjoy :)

    Holy shit. When a series throws ecchi and slapstick comedy at you for 20 episodes straight and then gives you a dramatic, tear jerking ending... your brain explodes and you&#039;re just left speechless. I had to think a while to decide what kind of a review I was going to give this series, more importantly I wasn&#039;t sure on the rating. I could give it a 9 for pulling off such an incredible combination or I could give it a 3 for being absolutely ludicrous. I decided to give it a 9, read on to find out why. <br />
<br />
First of all, this series should be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review68461">
        listed under the Hentai category. It starts off in the weirdest way possible. The female lead, Momoko is an innocent looking girl who aspires to become the world&#039;s top martial artist. She fails to master a certain technique and what&#039;s her father&#039;s solution to that? To find the world&#039;s strongest man and make babies who will later become the world&#039;s most powerful martial artists. Her reply? &quot;HAI!&quot;<br />
<br />
What follows then is a series of absolutely the wackiest scenes you will ever see in an anime series. I guarantee you that. Momoko finally finds her man, Inuzuka Koushi, and after a set of even whackier scenes wins his father&#039;s approval for a marriage. She then prepares a makeshift bed and asks Koushi to make love to her and Koushi promptly refuses. Yeah and this is only the very beginning of the very first episode. <br />
<br />
As it turns out, Koushi&#039;s father and Momoko&#039;s father have made an arrangement when they were born and that arrangement was to have Momoko and Koushi marry. Soon the whole thing comes into picture as we learn that Momoko and Koushi both belong to greatly respected martial arts famillies and their marriage was arranged to produce the world&#039;s strongest martial arts clan. Koushi however is not a martial artist but rather a weak, though intelligent, person who is not interested in violence in the slightest. <br />
<br />
Barely 2 episodes later we already know most of the main characters and the true over top craziness begins. Koushi takes on the role of the stereotypical sex symbol and every girl around him literally begs him for sex. I&#039;m not trying to be funny either, this is what actually happens in this anime. I&#039;m only giving you a heads up, discretion is advised. There&#039;s not a single episode where Momoko doesn&#039;t stun us with lines like &quot; I need your juice&quot; or &quot; Rock me sensless &quot;. The rest of the main female cast, Iroha and Sanae is no better. It&#039;s like they&#039;re ready to do anything for Koushi without hesitation. Indeed, the meeting of Iroha and Koushi is sure to give even the most experienced romance/ ecchi connoisseur the nosebleed of his life. And this anime will bombard you with these type of sexual and more often than not perverted scenes episode after an episode, scene after scene. Interestingly enough, the girls are the only ones who are being naughty here as the male lead, though attractive, has absolutely no sexual drive or interest in any things sexual. He&#039;s more of a selfish self-centered bookworm more concerned with his studies than anything else.<br />
<br />
The rest of the male cast is not even worth mentioning, they&#039;re only there to be jealous of Koushi and his female fanclub. None of them are given an episode and even though we are given some background information on them, they&#039;re so shallow and plot-insignificant they could have just as well been removed from the anime and you wouldn&#039;t even notice it. <br />
<br />
The series progresses like this, with occasional serious or dramatic moments, up until episode 20 and that&#039;s when the seriousness and drama starts. All I&#039;m going to say about the ending is that it wasn&#039;t as bad as I thought it would be. It could have been a lot more satisfying but it wasn&#039;t bad. As many reviewers have already mentioned and I mentioned it myself too, Koushi is a bit of a prick with an attitude problem, especially with the way he treats women. Unfortunatelly that doesn&#039;t change in the end and it&#039;s just one of those things that annoys the hell out of you. <br />
<br />
The sound and art are both good. I have no complains in this department. The design on the girls and the male lead are perfect and the slapstick comedy oftenly involves scaled down chibi versions of the main characters which worked pretty good and didn&#039;t ruin the overall feel of the series. Voice acting was convincing and not once did it feel out of place, likewise the opening and ending songs were very good.<br />
<br />
All in all this series makes a great job at taking all these ingredients together - ecchi, romance, comedy, harem and even drama and a slight bit of seriousness - and mixes them and produces a truly great anime series. This will be going into my favourite anime list and I will be rewatching this series in the not so distant future. And that is the reason why I gave it a 9 and that&#039;s the reason why I personally recommend this series to anyone reading this review.

    If  your  wondering , is this  anmie  worth  looking at  , let  me assure  that  not only is it worth your while , it will leave  you very  satisfied  afterward as well.<br />
<br />
The one thing that hit me the most  about this  anmie , was just  how well developed and written  the story and its characters were.<br />
whilst  not  being the most original of tales, nevertheless  it  had the ability  to cause  you  to connect and relate  to each and very one of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25255">
         it characters , each with their own  loves, hates, quirks and  follibies. its that  good.<br />
<br />
I dont even remember,the last time,I felt for a character like  I felt  for  sanae Nakajima ( the Horse  girl)  in  her unique  situation.Any more would be a spoiler <br />
But , if there was someone  i was rooting for it would be her.<br />
<br />
So the fact  , i would fee like that , is hats off to the folk  would produced this gem.<br />

    This anime could&#039;ve been better. After finishing it i&#039;m disappointed. Because at the start it was funny, unique, fast paced, espontaneous, entertaining. And all those assets start to slowly drop as the series goes on.<br />
<br />
They did a great job making it look like the characters progress, like they overcome their most secret and personal problems, but it&#039;s absolutely all the contrary. The characters and the story never progress after the very first episodes. Again, the series did a great job making it seem like it. After that we are left with some sort of repetitive slice of life, two filler episodes and a rushed all-of-a-sudden

          <span style="display: none;" id="review240699">
        ending.<br />
Koushi and momomo burn out in the first episodes and become repetitive very fast, specialy Momomo saying Koushi-dono 10 times per episode. It woldn&#039;t be a surpise if you end up hating on her.<br />
 How does the series compensate for this? Adding a mumbo jumbo of new villans every 3 episodes, villans that don&#039;t add anything  but to make time for the rushed ending that is supposed to give this series a meaning.<br />
<br />
The thing that i disliked the most was the use of CGI. <br />
This just has one unique purpose in the series and we&#039;re going to see it a lot. Sometimes it&#039;s done so badly, it breaks the whole picture. Making the scene look horribly goofy. 2D and 3D definitely don&#039;t mix well in this anime.<br />
<br />
The art is very basic, in the sence that character desings and backgrounds are just that, basic. Nothing new. Not a single time you&#039;ll stop the video to appreciate the image because there&#039;s nothing stunning about it. It&#039;s just ok, it&#039;s acceptable. So let&#039;s move on.<br />
<br />
Now with all of this said, was it worth it? I&#039;m doubting but i&#039;ll say yes. Because a strong point for this anime is it&#039;s &quot;comedy&quot;. They&#039;re no jokes but funny scenes. And a lot of them. Very well made.<br />
That&#039;s why i finished this series, the humor covers a little the mess of the plot, and how the series goes in circles for 22 episodes.<br />
<br />
Some things do progress and change, the family gets &quot;bigger&quot; if you will.<br />
But nobody gets what they say they want.<br />
<br />
This was a 9 that developed as a 7 or 6.<br />
If you&#039;re looking for a definitive ending, and not an open one. Then you should read the manga since the anime finished before it.<br />

    Ok ,Sumomomo momomo is a very interesting comedy anime.<br />
We follow a story of Momoko whom promised to her father to marry his friend&#039;s son and to give birth to the strongest offspring on the Earth.On the other hand our second character refered as Koushi-dono is just a ambitious teen that wants to become a prosecutor in order to punish criminals.<br />
 Paths of our main characters cross and Koushi-dono keeps saying no to Momoko&#039;s proposals of sex and giving birth to her child and blah blah blah<br />
   As it turns out there are  many assassins that want to kill teenager,one of them is

    Warning possible Spoilers<br />
<br />
Being a Martial Artist person myself I was actually interested in seeing where this would go, but after 22 gruelling episodes I was just meet with disappointment and quickly forgot this one.<br />
<br />
The story begins with the fathers of Momoko Kuzuryuu and Koushi Inuzuka who made a deal that their kids would get married, but when the time came for this Koushi wasn&#039;t exactly on board and now his life was about to become very different from his usual days.<br />
Now the story was pretty disappointing to watch not because it was boring or even annoying it just didn&#039;t turn out the way I thought

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251420">
        it would, I did like the diversity of the Martial artist families that would show up from time to time and the whole meaning of what it means to be a martial artist, but what really annoyed me was the chemistry between Momoko and Koushi now to be honest it&#039;s pretty much Koushi&#039;s fault really because he is unlikable as hell which I&#039;ll get to in a minute, the pacing was pretty meh as well even it was fillers with some story episodes as well it just didn&#039;t mix well for me and I just couldn&#039;t get interested often.<br />
<br />
The characters were really a mixed bunch, the male characters weren&#039;t really likeable, but the female characters weren&#039;t too bad and were pretty much what kept me going on the show.<br />
Momoko is the Main female character who is a loli and is a dragon of the Chinese Zodiac who wants to get married to Koushi so she can have a strong child, she is also a very hyperactive and strange person however that doesn&#039;t mean she was a bad character because I was actually rutting for her throughout the series and actually felt really sorry for when her advancements didn&#039;t get any notice.<br />
Koushi the Main male character is a bit of an asshole because he is has quit doing martial arts because of an incident with bullies and wants to be lawyer instead, but his interactions with Momoko make him a very unlikable person as he treats her like a piece of dirt even when she does all the house work for him he still doesn&#039;t show much appreciation for her efforts and even when he tries he does it so poorly it just annoyed me so much.<br />
Sanae Nakajima is Koushi&#039;s classmate and his class representative although secretly she is the Horse of the Chinese Zodiac and has a heroine persona called Tenchū Senshi Uma Kamen or Divine Punishment Warrior Horse Mask, her costume which looks like something out of Kill La Kill enhances her martial art skills, but they only get more powerful if she reduces the amount of clothing she is wearing, now she isn&#039;t a bad character and you understand her resentment to martial arts since she has feeling for Koushi, but she has to put up with it to uphold her families legacy.<br />
Iroha Miyamoto who is a 15 year old assassin who tries to kill Koushi, but she eventually falls in love with him and goes to the same school as him to get to know him better, Iroha is pretty much a Tsundere since she likes hitting her subordinate around whenever he does something wrong or wastes their money, but she wasn&#039;t a bad character since she does help the others from time to time.<br />
Hanzo is Iroha&#039;s subordinate and has a crush on her so obviously to find out she likes Koushi hit him real hard and makes him grow a hatred for Koushi, but he is a pretty unlikable character not as bad as Koushi, but his personality created more harm than good for the others.<br />
<br />
The artstyle didn&#039;t really stand out for me, but I did like some of the martial arts moves that Momoko and Sanae did from time to time and I also liked the look of Sanae&#039;s outfit despite how ridiculous it looked.<br />
<br />
The action was solid and did keep me entertained since it showed how badass Momoko was when it came to fighting other people which showed she was a useful person and the final battles in the final episodes was actually pretty good too, but it was too far between all the parts that were pretty dull.<br />
The Romance was painful to watch because it was just annoying watching Koushi acting like an asshole to Momoko all the damn time, there were a few sweet moments, but they were too far between all the annoying as hell stuff.<br />
<br />
Overall this was a very mixed bag and by the end I was just glad to be done with it, it had something going with it with the female characters which made me feel this should&#039;ve been an adventure anime about them beating up bad guys or something which would&#039;ve been way more entertaining, the only reason you should watch this is if you&#039;re a martial arts fan because if you&#039;re a Romance fan all you&#039;ll get is disappointment.

    Lets make babies in Sumomomo Momomo! The world of martial arts, intense ki, and lame jokes all over the place, and lolis, cannot forget the lolis.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story-7 out of 10<br />
The basic story of this series is fairly linear and predictable, but it isn&#039;t so much this way that it cannot be enjoyed, or ruined by any specific thing (other than spoilers of course). While you might be able to guess what&#039;s going to happen next, it does not necessarily mean you will not be wanting to watch more into it.<br />
<br />
The series starts off fairly slow, and doesn&#039;t really get going until later on, but once it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review67029">
        does, that&#039;s when its story elements shine. While it never becomes truly glorious at any one point, its still thoroughly entertaining if you can get past the intense levels of cheese.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art-7 out of 10<br />
The art of this series is fairly nice, when you look at it from an individual character stance, but altogether, it feels rather off at times, as the mixture of lolis and normal sized (sometimes immense) men and ladies doesn&#039;t really mix all too well, but this is easy to overlook as the rest of the series has a very nice feel to it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound-9 out of 10<br />
Sound for me is one of the most vital parts for an anime, and this series did a fantastic job on it. The music for this series is just outstanding, and almost always very fitting for every situation, not to mention that along with that, they also sound very good, and I would love to listen to them in my casual time because I felt they were just that good.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters-8 out of 10<br />
The characters of Sumomomo have very good developement for nearly the entire cast. Granted, some of the characters get nothing more than a small backstory, its still a very nice touch for a character who may or may not be there for more than 1 or 2 episodes, though I do wish the main characters got a tad more backstory, often times, they felt overshadowed by some of the supporting cast.<br />
<br />

Enjoyment-7 out of 10<br />
This series is great for those who really like lame jokes and spaztic situations (like me!), but often times at the beginning relies too heavily on fan service. This however seemingly lightens up over time, give or take a few scenes, and the jokes just fly out one after the other. This all, along with a nicely developed ending, adds up to be quite a nice combonation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall-8 out of 10<br />
I think in the end, this series is a fine series to watch, but not to be taken too seriously.

    This anime is great, wayyyyyyy too much fan service and filler arcs. Other than that the main character is the biggest douc** and is a very unlikable. The enjoyment you do get outta this is like great but if the guy weren&#039;t such a douc** to the girl, maybe this would be more enjoyable. Spoilers Below:<br />

The storyline is meh, too much filler and very little happening sometimes. Lots of stupid baby drama over simple stuff. Other than that the main character goes through some development though he is still an a** by the end whereas in the manga there is more to this story and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247367">
        a better ending. Anyhow the characters could&#039;ve been better in terms of their own character, some characters seemed flawed the side ones especially. This anime had ecchi which I didn&#039;t expect but other than that you&#039;ll like this anime if you like action, don&#039;t be afraid to skip a episode if it gets boring you only miss drama in certain parts.
