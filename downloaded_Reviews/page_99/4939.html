    Of course this is series is still ongoing so I&#039;ll be giving my current impressions of the Anime.<br />
Initially I was skeptical about watching this since it seemed like just another harem Anime thrown at us. But so far I find it quiet enjoyable.<br />
<br />
. Pros<br />
+ Not your typical generic harem<br />
+ Has a mature feel to it<br />
+ Nice balance between comedy and drama<br />
+ Unique setting, harem in a rich setting<br />
+ Pleasing visuals which matches the theme and setting<br />
+ Ecchi not over the top ( well most of it is censored anyways )<br />
+ Comedy level is just right<br />
+ Potential to get serious in the latter of the series<br />
+

          <span style="display: none;" id="review17550">
        Characters have depth to them<br />
+ Big boobs<br />
<br />
. Cons<br />
- Censored ( it can be good too, fanservice can be distracting ).<br />
- Girls a bit cliched ( but the series makes them feel refreshing )<br />
- Will it be able to wrap up nicely given it&#039;s only 12 episodes total?<br />
<br />
. In Detail :<br />
So far it doesn&#039;t seem to be your typical generic harem Anime. I haven&#039;t watched an extensive amount of harems. But I found the rich harem theme of this Anime unique. The main character is rich and so are the rest of the girls. While harems are typically comedic this one has a serious tone right off the bat. Of course that doesn&#039;t mean this Anime doesn&#039;t have comedy ( it is labeled ecchi, though it&#039;s currently censored ), it does. I feel that this Anime so far has a nice balance of comedy and seriousness. The series so far seems to have more depth than the typical harem. It takes the characters and plot in a mature way while being able to entertain us at the same time. Something that definitely stood out to be was the visuals which I found very pleasing to the eyes. It fits the theme of the Anime well which I believe greatly enhances the entire experience. While the characters may be fairly cliched ( girl with sword,tsundere, etc ), the way the series currently presents them makes the experience more refreshing. There&#039;s not so much to say bad about the Anime, it only just started and I didn&#039;t start watching with very high expectations. But so far I&#039;m surprised by how well I enjoy it so far. It seems that it well get more serious in the latter of the series. I&#039;ll continue watching.

    When asked about the nature of a harem anime, most anime fans think: average guy, surrounded by 3 or more seemingly unattainable girls, in an unusual setting chuck full of breast-grabbing and panty-flashing. Does Princess Lover fall into this abysmal group? Yes, however it had the potential to achieve a lot more than what most harems fail to achieve, seeing how it&#039;s based on a rather popular visual novel.<br />
<br />
That potential was shown in its characters however that same potential was foolishly squandered with its mediocre story. The story itself is typical, yet intriguing enough to keep most viewers interested. It’s about your average teenage boy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review20075">
        named Teppei, living an average life, with his average family... Then shit happens and our protagonist is later forced to live with his super rich grandpa and transfer to some absurd school for the super rich. <br />
<br />
After watching this I thought the writer must’ve taken whatever he could find from “Ye ol’ book of anime clichés” and decided that was their plot. Strangely enough, it worked surprisingly well when it came to introducing the characters to this profoundly entertaining story. The first half of the story basically sets this kind of tone for an exhilarating short series but in the end it was a wasted effort once the “real” story kicks in and boy, are you in for a ride. By ride I mean a one-way ticket to idiotsville, because only an idiot would throw away an enjoyable story for the garbage that replaced it.<br />
<br />
With all that said, this anime didn’t entirely turn into a steaming pile of crap and that’s thanks to the interesting cast of main characters. Harem protagonists usually fall into 2 groups: the losers and the kind-hearted saviours. Yet Teppei initially doesn’t fall into either, because within his playful character is a young lad struggling to deal with his past and moral dilemmas. Not to forget the 4 leading heroines, who were rather well developed, some more than others and 2 of which who seemed similar in design and personality to 2 more well-known characters from other series. Whether that was intentional or not is unknown to me but they happened to be the most interesting of the 4 heroines. However apart from Teppei’s grandpa, the supporting cast turned out to be far weaker than the loosely put together story and if a couple of them were killed off, the story could have done a whole lot better.<br />
<br />
The production values are somewhat difficult to delve into since a fairly unknown studio (GoHands) took on this series. The music was just about as memorable as every breath I take and the sound productions overall really isn’t any good. Yet the art style and animation has a unique vibrancy to it, giving a colourful experience that’s pleasing to the eyes. However the jarring simulated camera panning/rotation and the out of proportion bust sizes really brought it down for me.   <br />
<br />
Overall Princess Lover is a series that I hoped would break the chain of generic harem that seem to appear year after year, yet all it did was add unto the already tarnished reputation of the harem genre. Some of the blame falls onto the villains, who were the worst villains ever constructed but I blame the real villain… the idiot who thought of this crap. Well if you don’t mind all that I’ve said then watch at your own discretion; however I feel it’s more worthwhile to sit wait for the next Key &amp; KyoAni collaboration.<br />

    Mod Edit: This review may contain spoilers.<br />
---<br />
Shit, where do I start, man. Well, here&#039;s the thing: I&#039;ve been watching anime for over five years, which means that I&#039;ve seen several romance/harem series (everything from Maison Ikkoku to Love Hina). Most of them have the same traits, but in order to poke out a bit from each other, they&#039;ll have to be in different settings. The question is if it&#039;s different and well enough executed in a fashion that captivates the viewer. And I&#039;ll let it out straightaway: Princess Lover fails epicly at that. By looking at the title, you know that you&#039;re already fucked:<br />
<br />
Uh, so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review18229">
        the main character, Arima is going to succeed Arima Group Corporation, and by the sounds of it, it looks like it&#039;s like the biggest company in the world. And who&#039;s gonna take over it in near future? A teenager that knows shit about business. Who in the world would give away such a big responsibility to a relative they barely knew just like that? I can go on and on about this plot convenience, but hey, I&#039;ll spare you for that.<br />
<br />
Because succeeding the corporation is just a lame excuse to enter a rich girls&#039; school (okey, there are also boys there, but we barely get to see them). And of course, who do we meet there? It&#039;s the pink-haired girl whom he saved and his fiancee. And to answer your question straightaway: Yes, they do have big breasts. And yes, the pink-haired girl hugs Arima all the time with her gonzanga breasts. She&#039;s your typical cheery girl with a cheery voice with a hand that likes to wave awfully a lot. And the fiancee? She&#039;s your typical, somewhat-shy girl who speaks little. And when she does speak, she speaks kinda without emotions. She has coincidentally fencing as a hobby, which coincidentally matches with Arima&#039;s kendo, so they have by chance some common ground, I guess. With other words, we&#039;ve seen these type of personalities before. A lot. So what personality are we missing now? Tsundere? And yes, there is a tsundere girl in the series.  You&#039;ll know it straightaway when she pops up for the first time (hint: she has a slightly annoying/whiny voice, which all tsunderes have, so I guess that&#039;s alright). Did I mention that we also have a big-breasted maid? The anime industry sure knows what we like. And Arima Teppei is your average male main character.<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s not the best part yet (and by that, I mean the worst). The thing is with harem series, is that the plot can&#039;t be all fluffy and boobilicious all the time; it also needs some drama. Without telling too much: It&#039;s fucking ridiculous when you get to it. If you by any chance come to episode 7 or 8 (I don&#039;t quite remember which one), you&#039;re gonna have a fuckin&#039; laugh. I swear, the plot progression from there might be the most retarded one in harem anime history. It&#039;s clearly not to be taken seriously. I don&#039;t know, but I sure facepalmed a lot during that particular episode. And by of what I&#039;ve heard; the series is based off of an H-game, so that kind of sucky plot is expected, I guess.<br />
<br />
Is there anything good in Princess Lover? The art is decent and not ugly to look at. The animation is standard, but not bad. And if you&#039;re looking for ecchi-ness, you&#039;ve found it. A lot of booooobies. *coughEDcough* The music is not memorable at all; it&#039;s just generic. Visually speaking, the opening was pleasing to look at. In fact, I remember the breasts more than the music itself. And btw, Arima Isshin&#039;s voice is so badass (Wakamoto Norio is badass after all).<br />
<br />
So unless you enjoy torturing yourself or your friends, avoid Princess Lover at all cost. I fuckin&#039; used 160 minutes of my life saving your eyes. At least the show wasn&#039;t as bad as Koi Koi Seven. If you wanna see only big breasts and ecchi-ness, then there&#039;s actually better shows for that, like &quot;He is my Master!&quot;. If you&#039;re looking for a good romance/harem anime, then go watch &quot;Ichigo 100%&quot; (the manga is better, though), &quot;True Tears&quot;, &quot;Lovely Complex&quot; or &quot;ef - a tale of memories&quot;.<br />
<br />
YOU OWE ME YOUR LIFE.

    You have a summary of Princess Lover, so I won&#039;t bother telling you that. I won&#039;t post any spoilers, so don&#039;t worry. <br />
<br />
Overall  7<br />
Princess Lover started off very good. It had a serious with light humor tone, with all the ecchi-ness included;  but, then went way downhill in the second half which really hurt it overall. <br />
<br />
Story  6<br />
If I was only rating the first 6 or so episodes, this show would be a 9 because it was very enjoyable. It&#039;s very obvious who Teppi likes right from the start (Charlotte) and they have a lot of nice romantic moments. So why did

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19078">
        I give the story a 6? In the second half of Princess Lover, this show fails.....very hard. The last episodes were pretty bad. They bring in special ops and the story tries way to hard to be funny causing it not to be very funny. The story tries to be serious, but overall just can&#039;t be taken seriously. The only plus to the story in the last arc is that Teppi weeds girls out with a kiss. That&#039;s the only good thing. <br />
<br />
Art  8<br />
The art was very good, epically for a harem anime. Everything was pretty fluent and looked fine, but there were some distortions in some scenes that weren&#039;t really the focus of the shot which, if you noticed them, made the art seem not as good (animators got lazy/ budget issues). It never happened on the main focus of the scene though<br />
<br />
** not included in the rating** I would wait for the uncensored version to watch this show, in the censored version they censor things that are already censored. <br />
<br />
Sound 8<br />
The OP/ Ed were pretty good and the characters voices were all done well. Nothing to really say here, no complaints and nothing to really say that was especially amazing. <br />
<br />
Character 7<br />
One downfall to the characters is even thought Teppi, Charlotte, Seika, Yuu, and Sylvia are the main characters, only Teppi and Charlotte get any real screen time. The others are are there, but don&#039;t do a whole lot until the end. <br />
<br />
Teppi &gt;&gt; an okay harem lead. had some funny moments and wanted to save everyone. But he turned into one of those &quot;talk it out&quot; characters to the main &quot;villains&quot;<br />
Charlotte &gt;&gt; A lot of people didn&#039;t like her, but I liked her. She&#039;s a typical pink haired harem character who is very clingy to Teppi. SHe isn&#039;t very smart, but she was the funniest. (sex jokes about Teppi&#039;s .......)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 7<br />
As I&#039;ve already stated, the series started off really good and was very promising, but then went way downhill in the second half which really hurt my enjoyment.

    This could have gotten a big fat &quot;1/10&quot; if not for the art/fanservice.<br />
<br />
Basically an H-Game that should have been an H-Anime. The storyline is so poorly constructed and contained reasoning so shallow that I have thought to myself &quot;WTF?&quot; or &quot;That&#039;s so shallow&quot;.<br />
<br />
The deal with Princess Lover is that it&#039;s basically a harem anime but for the reason of making it feel different (in a disastrous way) from the rest, it goes on by inserting a serious side to the plot which can be seen halfway to the end.<br />
<br />
This is where the story becomes irredeemable.<br />
<br />
The first 2 or 3 episodes was quite interesting since it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19208">
        feels like a royalty harem anime that feels like it has a potential to be something unique. After the introductory arc comes the annoying &quot;Passing the Club&quot; which has started the downhill trend for this title. Then there&#039;s the last arc (Save the Princess). I found myself remembering the forum posts on various anime sites saying how bad it was. <br />
<br />
In a nutshell, you&#039;ll watch this for the high production values and fanservice and nothing else. Then again, the terrible story will probably deter you from enjoying that in the first place.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
High production values<br />
Fanservice (for guys)<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
Story<br />
Stupid and shallow reasons for the arc problem<br />
<br />
Princess Lover got lucky by having a 3/10.

    i know it isn&#039;t good to a review on a anime that just aired but i just had to. i want to know what guy hasn&#039;t dreamed of becoming rich and being surrounded by hot babes with huge breast. <br />
<br />
STORY 9-  Arima Teppe, main character, lost his parents, reasons not known yet, and was adopted by grandfather, whose probably a billionaire. basically over night he went from poor to rich and from single and to #$%^, watch if you want to know. he is a lucky son of a B****, granted he lost his parents, but still a SOB regardless.<br />
<br />
ART 9-  as far

          <span style="display: none;" id="review16598">
        as art in anime goes. it is pretty good. no complaints. the actions scenes were well done and the details were excellent.<br />
<br />
SOUND 7- I&#039;m going to be perfectly honest with you. i don&#039;t remember it. HAHAHA *sigh* ... that&#039;s kinda bad. well thinks of it like this. it wasn&#039;t so good that i would remember it and it wasn&#039;t so bad that i would complain. the OP and the ED songs were fine as well. everything blended well with the story.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER 8- there isn&#039;t much i can say about the characters at the moment, but of the one character that has any character development besides the introduction is Arima Teppe. he is looking for revenge on #$%^@. <br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT 8-  this story seem like it will be interesting as far as the plot goes. i hope the classic themes don&#039;t mean over played cliches are also coming. <br />
<br />
OVERALL 8- if you don&#039;t mind being jealous of this guy then i recommend it. the plot seems to be interesting enough.<br />
<br />
note- please comment, i feel i need some criticism in order for me to improve.

    I&#039;ve thought a lot about what I think is useful when starting to watch an anime - criteria that might change my thoughts as to whether or not to watch a series. I’ve customized this list to what you typically see in ecchi series. First I give the criterion, then I define the parameters of the criterion, then I state how the series matched up against the specified parameters. I also note how things like art and the soundtrack affect my overall rating of a series (along with what I thought of the two components), if anyone is interested in that.<br />
 I don&#039;t claim that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review136399">
        this criteria will be universal - different people have different tastes and value different things, but this review is what would make/break watching a series for me. Mild spoilers ahead.<br />
<br />
Annoying Mascot Characters<br />
1. It&#039;s not a matter of whether or not the mascot character is annoying, it&#039;s a matter of how annoying the mascot character is.<br />
1) There is not a clearly defined mascot character in this series. Occasionally the main romantic interest acts as a mascot character, asking really simple questions so things can be elaborated more for the viewer, and offering overly-simple frustration at whatever unfortunate circumstance is unfolding. That being said, the main romantic doesn&#039;t often do that and when she does it&#039;s only mildly annoying.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
1. I find art to be pretty subjective. If I find it to be particularly good, it might +1 my overall opinion of the series, but I typically don’t hold it against a series for being averagely animated for the time it was animated.<br />
1) The art in this series was pretty average, nothing eye-popping and almost nothing distractingly bad. If I had one complaint about the art it would be that the most of the main female cast had breasts that were big just a bit beyond  the point of believability. I personally find female characters more attractive when I think that finding someone with their proportions in the real world is not impossible. <br />
<br />
Friend Quality (MC-Male Friends)<br />
1. The male friend(s) is/are (a) pervert(s) who do not get much characterization outside of getting the MC into trouble<br />
1) That’s essentially what Teppei’s group of male friends are. There are two distinctions to be made: first, Teppei is the ringleader for his group of friends; second, there is a male friend Teppei has who is constantly ignored – he’s generic, but outside of the parameter of the stereotypical male friends in ecchi series.<br />
<br />
Gratifying<br />
1. The MC is not a hopeless loser with no talents and horrible grades. If he is, when he improves, his improvements come relatively early in the series and they stay for the duration of the series.<br />
2. When the MC has to fight, he fights. (This doesn&#039;t have to do with the MC fighting well, just not being a pushover.)<br />
3. The MC hones his skill and visibly improves throughout the series (when there&#039;s action in the included genre)<br />
4.  Romantic interests are forthcoming about their feelings (both the MC and the girl involved)<br />
1) The main character certainly was not a loser, and not a clear-cut winner either. His grades weren&#039;t mentioned at any point throughout the series, so we&#039;re left to assume he&#039;s okay there. <br />
2) When the MC had to fight, he fought, with little or no prompting from other characters.<br />
3) The MC had good swordsmanship, but did not visibly improve it throughout the series. There was character skill progression, but it was more learning how to function in high-society (think Hayate no Gotoku without the ridiculousness and you&#039;ll have a decent perspective of what the training was like).<br />
4) The MC was not too decisive during the course of the series about who his number one female was, he seemed to enjoy his female counterparts equally, there weren&#039;t any surprises about who he somewhat leans towards at the end of the series. The female counterparts are all pretty forthcoming about their feelings, there was one girl who was kind of a tsundere, but she was definitely forthcoming by the middle of the series and not particularly violent.<br />
<br />
Magical Falling<br />
1. The MC somehow ends up in the 69 position or groping the female foil(s)&#039; chest more often than humanly possible<br />
1) This is an ecchi show, so it does happen; however, it&#039;s much less frequent than other ecchi shows. Also, the female character(s?) play(s?) it off much better than other ecchi show female character(s) do.<br />
<br />
Memory Problems<br />
1. The MC has forgotten a promise to a childhood friend<br />
2. The MC has forgotten the face of a childhood friend he made a promise to<br />
3. The MC has amnesia <br />
1) There were no MC memory problems in this series<br />
<br />
Predictable Transfers <br />
1. If they&#039;re an antagonist in one episode, they&#039;re in the MC&#039;s class the next.<br />
1) The only predictable transfer was the MC into the academy, and it was by no means painful to watch. <br />
<br />
‘Special’ Main Character<br />
1. The MC is somehow distinguished during the course of the series from his peers – be it a special power or sudden change in social status<br />
1) This happens – you know what it is from the summary given on MAL<br />
<br />
Soundtrack<br />
1. This rarely has an impact on my overall rating of a series, but I do feel I should note when I think a soundtrack is particularly memorable<br />
1) I thought the soundtrack was good, in that I remember thinking it was good as I watched the series; however, I don’t remember any scenes that really hit home for me because of the music – which sometimes happens to me when I watch anime.<br />
<br />
Voice Acting<br />
1. I&#039;m not particularly judgmental about voice acting, the only thing that really bothers me is if there&#039;s a male character with a particularly effeminate voice or vice versa<br />
2. If there is English in the subbed version, there either isn&#039;t a lot or there is not a thick Japanese accent with characters who are supposed to be native/fluent English speakers<br />
The voice acting was fine in both regards. <br />
1) I remember thinking (as I was watching the series) that the antagonist for this series has a great voice actor. <br />
2) There was not a lot of English in this series.<br />
<br />
<br />
1) One thing that bothered me about the show was how clear-cut the themes were, despite them dealing with complex topics which don&#039;t really have an answer to them. One of the themes is more &#039;money more problems&#039;. Another one of the themes seems to be, &#039;poor people shouldn&#039;t blame rich people for their being poor, they should just stop being poor&#039;. This really just left a bad taste in my mouth, if they left some characters and some plot more up to the viewer to decide what is right and what is wrong, I would have been much happier with the quality of the story.<br />

    There are a lot of harem anime around there, but this harem anime was the only one that made me emotional. Princess lover focused more on romance than ecchi, and that&#039;s probably the reason why I got more emotional. <br />
<br />
The characters were different, especially the MC. Instead of a shy and normal protagonist living a normal life in a normal house, It had Teppei, the heir of a rich man living a dangerous life in a huge mansion. I&#039;ve never seen any character like him. There&#039;s a lot of Charlottes and Sylvias out there, but only a few Teppei. Sure, he resembles other mainstream characters,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review165253">
        but you can see that his personality was different from them.<br />
<br />
As to the plot, it was perfect. There were no holes other than the open ending. What made it unique from ther harem anime is that it had a balanced plot. It didn&#039;t have a hella long introduction and fillers. It went straight to the point and perfectly balanced, with cliffhangers to keep the tension and interest of viewers.<br />
<br />
One thing I liked. About this anime was the graphics. You won&#039;t even realize that there&#039;s a transition from picture to picture. The graphics were simply a classic, even though it was aired in 2009.<br />
<br />
The voice acting... Pretty common, to be honest. But still, they did a great job.<br />
<br />
All in all, I loved it. It was an entirely new thing for me. Emotional and romantic, that&#039;s princess lover!

    I never thought I would find myself writing another review given the fact that I don&#039;t watch anime as much as I used to, but the hilarity that is Princess Lover! warranted another one with my poor command of the English language.<br />
<br />
So where to begin? <br />
<br />
The plot is straightforward enough...random guy becomes the heir to a vast fortune and has to become accustomed to living as a rich man. So that&#039;s where that ends...this anime can be summed up in pretty much one word: Fanservice!<br />
<br />
Trying to understand some of the events that goes on as the &quot;plot&quot; progresses is not good for your health and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review46547">
        I highly advise against it. Seriously...some of the events that occur are downright outrageous and make no sense whatsoever. So stick to the reason why you chose to watch this, okay?<br />
<br />
Being the fanservice anime that it is, it knew where to focus its budget. The fanservice art is superb and gets the job done. There are no complaints on this department whatsoever and this may be the only point in which this anime excels at. <br />
<br />
The musical score is decent, but nothing memorable so let&#039;s keep moving here.<br />
<br />
Character wise...well this will pretty much play like most visual novel adaptations out there. You&#039;ll grow to like the sub heroines and hate life as the main heroine pales in comparison to them. Seika (the twintail tsundere) is the highlight of the show for me. I can&#039;t divulge anymore details without entering spoiler territory, but she fits in to the catogery of &quot;proactive&quot; tsundere. Oh there&#039;s also the other heroines...maid-san is nice, the blond fencer is also nice, and the heroine is annoying.<br />
<br />
I chose to watch this anime for the sake of the comedy and knew full well what I was getting in to with the &#039;ecchi&#039;, &#039;harem&#039;, and &#039;romance&#039; tags attached. If you keep those in mind and brace yourself for what&#039;s to come, then you&#039;ll have no problem getting some enjoyment out of this. And even then that doesn&#039;t say much as everything is a giant trainwreck after the Seika arc. Oh and don&#039;t even bother expecting a Sylvi route as there is none; go check the OVA if you want Sylvi goodness.<br />
<br />
Overall...a deploring anime whose sole redeeming factor is the fanservice and Seika. If you aren&#039;t a fan of either, then stay the hell away. If you are...well its only 12 episodes and they really handled Seika&#039;s character pretty well. <br />
<br />
And that&#039;s Princess Lover! in a nutshell.

    &quot;Ill deal with it somehow!&quot; - Teppei Arima<br />
Teppei, a young teenage boy who lived with his mother and father in a social status that could be considered poor, but he was happy. Unknown to him, his life changed dramatically after his parents died in an accident that could be related to the recent attacks on the rich families in his area. Accepting his grandfather&#039;s adoption, Teppei is forcibly thrust into a world where he went from poor to filthy rich. The romance/comedy/action that ensues following his attempts at adapting to the rich life is one worth watching.<br />
<br />
I found Princess Lover! One of the unique harem/ecchi/romance

          <span style="display: none;" id="review104427">
        anime that I have seen. Contrary to the many harem anime out there, Princess Lover! put on its own style despite being adapted from an adult visual novel. <br />
<br />
The Story: Considering all the harem based anime I have seen thus far, Princess Lover! is set in an entirely different setting. Rather than the typical high school drama, PL focuses more on a the world that surrounds the main character which includes Japan families, royalty from other countries, and heirs to major fashion companies. (Not to mention all of whom are filthy rich). The story starts out suddenly, Teppei, completely happy with his life, is suddenly ripped from his normal atmosphere when his parents die in an accident. His grandfather, who adopts him, turns out to be the owner of a mega famous and popular company, The Arima Combine. The comedy that comes from Teppei&#039;s sudden transfer to the rich and famous was very pleasing. Even in the short 12 episodes, the plot development surprised me. Usually in harem anime, one doesn&#039;t see much plot development because of the major focus on the characters, PL does a good job of balancing both. The story setting and plot isn&#039;t a typical harem themed anime, and because of that, PL has a more mature/different/pleasing feeling. Not only does the plot explain more on the conflict between the rich and poor, it also touches on economics and the roles that CEO play in running major corporations. Not only did GoHands, and Dream Force did a good job of balancing the plot and characters to where the story actually progressed to an obvious well done climax and falling action, but they also did well in including comedy and drama. <br />
<br />
Art and Sound: The visuals done by the producers weren&#039;t sharp and picturesque like one would see in modern anime, but the smooth brightly colored drawings added to the music that accompanied it. I&#039;ve never had to find fault at an anime&#039;s pictures or music, but for a 2009 anime, I think PL did very well. Being tagged as an ecchi anime I was pleased that the fan service wasn&#039;t over the top, but tastefully added. There are uncensored and censored versions but either way, it doesn&#039;t detract from the work as a whole. <br />
<br />
Characters: Like in any generic harem anime, the main character can fall into one of two categories. The useless loser type, or the kind-hearted &quot;I&#039;ll save everyone type&quot;. Unusually Teppei doesn&#039;t fall into either. With a good background from his parents backing his personality, a kind output that allows him to interact well with the people around him, the animators also made a character that I haven&#039;t seen so far. Teppei, unlike generic harem main characters, actually saves the day from time to time, either with his badass kendo skills, or his growing skills in managing a business. It seems as though to put it in other words, comparing it to usual harems, for example To Love Ru, Teppei and the characters in PL, and Rito and the characters in TLR are reversed. While Rito depends on the aliens to save him most of the time (not to mention he is dead useless physically), Teppei can be considered the opposite. (Although, I think deflecting bullets with a wooden kendo sword is a little far fetched.) The other characters in PL were also somewhat unique, but not so much that one couldn&#039;t see similarities. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment and Overall: I think the major aspect of PL that allowed it to be good, would be the overall feeling of how different it is compared to the norm. In my words, it thought outside the lines of the box and succeeded. If one is looking for a break from the typical harem type anime, PL provides pretty much all of that. To reiterate, with a unique setting, different main character, and actually some plot development that occurs, succeeding at balancing these unusual additions to the harem style, PL is one worth watching. PL can also be considered an indie anime, but it is also underrated; if any of you who read this play League of Legends, it&#039;s like an unpopular champion that is actually very strong.  <br />

    wow... I really don&#039;t know what to say. I never would have thought that I&#039;d watch an anime that had the words &quot;Princess&quot; and &quot;Lover&quot; in it, let alone both of them together.<br />
<br />
<br />
The story is exactly the kind of stuff that I love. A decent, average guy that gets thrown into a world where he has no idea what&#039;s going on. <br />
<br />
The great thing about Princess Lover is the fact that the protagonist isn&#039;t one of those clueless airhead guys. He knows that the girls around him love him, Hell they even say it to his face, and hes man enough to take it into

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36235">
        consideration and go with the flow. He doesn&#039;t hurt them like other guys do.<br />
<br />
I would highly recommend this anime to anyone who is interested.

    Princess Lover, not your made in 10 minute harem story where the girls just automatically plastered themself on the main lead.<br />
<br />
The story is about a poor boy who found out he had a extremely rich grandfather after his parent&#039;s death.This is the very boy who ended up being the successor of his grandfather&#039;s business and the same person who is loved by two princess character female lead which are actually princesses.<br />
<br />
This anime do not have the &quot; I Love All &quot; ending where the guy doesnt decide who he likes and just continue his life with all the female leads.<br />
He chooses and decides the one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27836">
        that he loves and goes all out for her risking his very own life.<br />
<br />
I definitely enjoyed this anime very much, it would be regrettable as a anime fan to miss this anime, it picks up right on episode 1.<br />
<br />
With state of the art, artwork and graphics and sound, with a intense story and pleasant character devolopment with a mix of fantasy and reality.<br />
<br />
It is hard not to enjoy this anime to the fullest.

    When people say this isn&#039;t your typical harem anime THEY ARE LYING TO YOUR FACE. Just like every other anime a majority of the girls fall in love with the main protagonist for next to no reason and the further in the anime you get the less sense everything starts to make. Normally for a review a would talk about the story in detail but because this one is essentially only a slice of life for the first 7 eps im going to only briefly talk about them. Warning contains spoilers <br />
<br />
Story: <br />
<br />
The story centres around Teppei Arima who becomes super rich after been named

          <span style="display: none;" id="review193504">
        the heir to the Arima corporation. He then finds out that he has an arranged marriaged to Sylvia Van Hossen.<br />
The first 3 eps is simply introducing the cliche&#039; harems girls (none will stick with you for very long). After that until ep 7 it is simply him going to school and finding out just how hard it is be super rich for no reason. Such complications include trying to get into his schools social club ( i know right riveting) and trying to get a girl to not hate him simply because of his last name.<br />
<br />
After ep 7 however is where it starts to get really stupid, a group of terrorists who hate the armia group because they&#039;re rich (yep thats the whole fucking reason, no joke) attack their headquarters to try and frame them doing something bad or something and during the attack they take control of their systems. Never ever ever ever have I heard computer terminology so poorly used in my life. It was so bad iI had to actually stop the ep and go for a walk to clear my head; I dont think the writer of this anime knew what the fuck they where writing and just put in whatever words they thought might work for the scenario. So after a bunch of bull shit that lead them to regaining control Tempai Arima decides to go rescue Charlotte Hazelrinkin (more on her later) instad of letting the professionals handle the work <br />
<br />
WARNING THIS IS WHERE I GET REALLY PISSES OFF<br />
<br />
After rescuring the useless Charlotte he finds and does not raise a point of asking why everyone else in the FUCKING BUILDING HAS UP AND LEFT THEM IN THE BUILDING WITH FUCKING BOMBS IN  IT and must now with the extremely useless Charlotte go defuse one of the bombs planted in the building. After getting to safety Sylvia now decides she is not going to let her fiancee&#039; die with her doing nothing like her mothers deaths (I get more into this with the character portion of the review but this makes no sense at all) and goes back into the building she just ditched him at and try to defuse a bomb (note she has absolutely no fucking experience what so ever with bombs) instead of letting the bomb specialists do it under the ruse that &quot;they cant make it in time&quot;. So you&#039;re telling me you have time to helicopter some fucking inexperienced girls into the building but not bomb specialists? . After finding the bomb Teppai runs into one of the terrorists with a gun. Remember when i said that this anime was exactly like every other harem out their? This puts the nail in the coffin. Whilst being a very huge range disadvantage teppai with Charlotte cheering him in the background proceeds to dodge every bullet he fires ( and this is a professional marksman btw) and knocked him out in one hit; even though he was wearing full body armour. He then proceeds to throw the bomb into some shaft which was then stated to be able to withstand the bomb. <br />
<br />
If you havent got the message yet this story sucks fucking balls, all that happens later is the girls fighting over his attention. I give the story a 2 because not only does it use every cliche&#039; in the book but it is terribly written, and poorly executed. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art; <br />
<br />
Thankfully the one good thing I can say about this anime is that it looks the part, this is the only good thing that I got out of this anime (note: dont use this as an excuse as I did to watch this piece of shit) <br />
<br />
Characters <br />
<br />
Arima Teppei: His your typical harem anime main protagonist, oblivious to peoples feelings of him? Check. Has supernatural speed and dexterity only when the situation demands it? Check . Puts his life on the line to save people despite not knowing them? check. Solves every problem around other characters in an attempt to help? Check. The list goes on and on, he is nothing more than your typical good guy anime protagonist. Very poorly done and a shit character all around. <br />
<br />
Sylvia Van Hossen: <br />
<br />
Like every other main character in this piece of shit, Sylvia is nothing more than a kundere, she ticks off every cliche&#039; in the book. However she does have some strong points and is probably the most enjoyable of all the main characters. She has a great deal of experience in fencing and doesnt just start to like him out of the blue for no reason like the rest. In this story she is his fiancee&#039; however this anime for some reason doesnt use this has an excuse for her like him out of the blue which is weird  cause this anime is nothing but a giant cliche&#039; fest. She has a strong bond Charlotte which is actually properly explained in the story through a series of flash backs. She is the only character besides charlotte to have an actually explained bond with any other character that is simply because the story said it must be like that. <br />
<br />
<br />
Charlotte Hazelrink: <br />
<br />
Typical dereder who falls in love with Teppei and is jealous of Sylvia cause they&#039;re getting married. Aside from having large breasts their is nothing really more to say about this character, very boring. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion: <br />
<br />
<br />
This anime sucked balls, the only good character was Sylvia. The story was cliche&#039;, boring and poorly executed. Please do not watch this anime   <br />
   <br />
<br />

    Ok so story, this the most predictable beginning I have ever seen If you watch the first episode you will understand what I mean. In the first episodes I was thinking ok it seems like fun average school theme. I guarantee that if you continue to watch this ridiculous storyline of the anime you will surely feel disappointed by especially somewhere around 8 or or 9. Pretty much no effort at all( Lets be honest after the first episode you&#039;ll understand how the story plays and who wins but there are a couple of funny scenes in there). <br />
<br />
Art- For this a 7 because not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review40501">
        of the over-sized melons(well maybe a little) but the environment and architecture was very detailed to a certain extent.<br />
<br />
Sound - I mean it really depends on the quality of the video. <br />
<br />
Character - No surprise... abnormally large boobs on strangely skinny girls. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment- its like a roller coaster it goes up and  down except this time it goes up a few episodes then stays down for the rest of the eps. I actually had  wait a few days to watch it because I was pissed how they exposed the ending like that. Lastly they weren&#039;t kidding when they called it &quot;princess&quot; lover.<br />

    I was actually suprised that i picked this anime to watch or that i actually enjoye watching it although i still ended up asking myself if i seriously just watched and enjoyed it. Well enough blabbering. <br />
<br />
Reveiw:<br />
<br />
Okay so the story isnt something new, i mean lots of shows hit you with this theme, meaning: average guy today, super rich guy tomorrow. Cliche to say the least but it did well however the overall storyline does seem a bit weak later on as the animators introduced slight contrasting material but still it didnt completely kill it. i say a good 7.<br />
<br />
The art was nicely done, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review46769">
        i liked the character styling, however near the ending the animators seemed to forget a few frames. Despite that i say an 8<br />
<br />
Sound, well what can i say bout the sound, not much really, would have given it an 7 or 8 but the themes absoluutely killed it, they were , well ...sometimes it was hard to remember that there was actually a theme at all.<br />
<br />
Characters were probably the best aspect of the show, they were developed well especially the lead male and 2 of the main females while not being overly so. A 9 in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment. like i said, i was suprised i actually enjoyed this anime, however say so, it wasn&#039;t enjoyable to the degree of riveting you to your chair but rather something that you would enjoy a few episodes, get up do something else then continue it later. I would say it deserves a 7 to be fair. As for recommending it, i would if you want something light to watch to kill time but not if you want something engrossing and epic.

    Overall score:9.84<br />
This is the greatest drama series I&#039;ve ever seen, be it manga or anime. <br />
[Notable picks:]<br />
Drama:10 l Tragedy:4 l School life:4 l Inspirational:8 l Wholeness of plot:9 l Harem:8 l Comedy:6 l Romance:6 l Action: 8<br />
<br />
Story:10<br />
Quite notably, there are three parts to this series: Intro, Making allies and crisis. I felt that it is very well-structured and fan-service does not impede the plot at all, except in the first part of ep 6, which was a bit excessive. Little unnecessary scenes.<br />
<br />
Especially worth commending are the drama and inspirational scenes, which were aplenty. Drama especially unfolds from the ep7. That means that before ep 6

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23962">
        the mood for the series was quite light, whereas it was heavy from 7 onwards.<br />
<br />
Story was original, especially when this is a harem genre series. Like Asu no Yoichi, all of the main and some of the side characters played a heavy part in the development of the plot and climatic ending. The seemingly deep plot uncovered at the intro was properly addressed by the climatic ending, which is not every series could do. <br />
<br />
One setback is that by the last minutes of the last episode, the harem presented seems to be still held there, and no firm conclusion was made with who Teppei was going to be with.<br />
<br />
Art:9<br />
The art was amazing. Characters sometimes had near-perfect expressions. Colour was comfortable with the eyes and landscape was amazingly presented. Special effects looked almost real.<br />
<br />
Sound:9<br />
Some bgm were fantastic, some OSTs were spectacular and fitting in well with the scenes. OP and ED were great and fitting with the series, esp OP. Voice actresses and actors displayed emotions, reactions etc. well. <br />
<br />
Character:10<br />
Amazing use of characters to move plot along, all had special talents. We have a combat butler, a compassionate princess, a pro-fencer, a pro-swordsman, people with high authority and wisdom etc. Character development was great, but Isshin seemed to have a mysterious feel even to the end. Characters&#039; personalities were improving till the end, but not out of place.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:9<br />
I would have liked it even more if they didn&#039;t change the atmosphere so quickly from ep 6 to 7. Overall, I enjoyed the tension and plot presented throughout the whole series. You would love this series if you like drama.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
This is one of my top 3 fav anime for sure, since I rarely find any series that really has potential for deep plots but yet finish them. <br />
<br />
One regret is that the harem was still unresolved right till the end, it&#039;s as if the producer was happy to let the series as a harem judging from what the main female characters say in the end.<br />
<br />
Also, in the ending scenes, the eng subs for songs in the last episode was not presented very well for the one I watched.

            STORY: Princess lover has a great potential of becoming a great harem anime but the thing that spoilt it was the lack of good comedy and the &#039;falling action&#039;. usually in a normal harem anime, there would be 3~7 episodes when they will tell us more about the characters and for the growth of the relationship between the charaters. i was disappointed when 8~12 because it was already like the end of the story. if this anime was made into a 24 episodes anime, it could have been a great sucess. <br />
<br />
     

          <span style="display: none;" id="review20275">
         ART: nothing great. the best thing is the rich background of the characters.<br />
<br />
       SOUND:  the op is not bad but there are no interesting music during in the anime or climax.<br />
<br />
        CHARACTERS: everyone was great but i really get boring of personalities like charlotte. she just sticks onto teppei. this way, it becomes a one-sided harem. the character and appearance of sylvie is very similar to saber( fate/stay night). <br />
<br />
        ENJOYMENT: I recommend this anime to harem lovers but not to action lovers because you&#039;ll get boring of the fighting scenes. the movement is slow, and the fights ends so fast.<br />
<br />
         OVERALL: 6/10. if I didn&#039;t count episode 8~12, i would give this a 7/10.

    This is the best Anime I&#039;ve ever seen!<br />
<br />
Because this anime does not dependig on the length of a video, how many episode this anime have, the video is depending on the way they let you think, watch, feel.<br />
<br />
It doesn&#039;t matter what other peoples thinks of this video, the fact is just that this anime really can bring the message to you, that&#039;s one of the most important thing of watching an anime.<br />
<br />
Either the storyline is good, so far.<br />
<br />
So I really look forward to see the other episodes!<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work, and may this anime continues in the future with more episodes.

    At first glance this may seem like an ordinary ecchi, harem anime wtih little to no story. But I surprised by the animation, it may be a little choppy from time to time but the fact that the characters move WHILE talking (at least a little).<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
The story is better then some of the other harem anime i have seen but i wouldn&#039;t say its good either. Its like Seirei Tsukai no Blade Dances story in a way <br />
like &quot;I lost 6 liters of blood but i can still fight for my friends&quot; type of story. So i didnt enjoy it THAT much. The harem is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200880">
        not satisfying at all...<br />
<br />
ART<br />
The art is literally the most average art I have ever seen...<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
I didnt like the soundtrack, but im sure some of you will :) <br />
<br />
OVERALL<br />
Its a great anime about oppai and rich people, with average art and (in my opinion) bad soundtrack. To finish it off I will just say: Its the most average show i have seen, with the worst harem in my opinion.

    Anime is a pretty generic harem. The beginning is very good and entertaining, then it becomes more boring because it shows that the protagonist has a favorite. This makes the series kind of boring and predictable. In other words, it is not the best anime to see but neither is the but. It is entertaining but not enough to recommend it. The waifus are very good too, so I did not like that I choose one, better to be with all of them.<br />

En español:<br />
El anime es un harem bastante genérico. El comienzo es muy bueno y entretenido, después se vuelve mas aburrido porque se nota

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418007">
        que el protagonista tiene una preferida. Esto vuelve a la serie medio aburrida y predecible. O sea no es el mejor anime para ver pero tampoco el pero. Es entretenido pero no tanto como para recomendarlo. Las waifus están muy bien también por eso no me gusto que elija a una, mejor estar con todas.
