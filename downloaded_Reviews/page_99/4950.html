    This story has a pretty cliche&#039; storyline. Guy meets girl, then other girls suddenly appear in droves. Seen it before, right? Well UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie has a few twists that set it apart form other romantic comedies. First, because the main female protagonist has shared her soul with the male lead, she has regressed mentally and physically to the level of a six year old, which presents a whole new challange when it comes to romance. Secondly, the story is dramatic and serious when it needs to be, so  the series has just enough drama in it to make it believeable.<br />
<br />
The artwork is very

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29371">
        clean and bright, which compliments the atmosphere nicely. And be careful all you delicate types out there; all but three or four episodes in the entire franchise (around fifty episodes) shows certain female body parts, so be warned.

&quot;To the bath house and beyond&quot; or maybe that&#039;s what they should have called this psycho circus called Ufo Ultramaiden Valkyrie..And if you&#039;re not impressed by the title alone let me give you some more useful details that will arouse your...Mind.<br />
<br />
What? Did you think i was gonna say your pants? What anime do you think this is anyway? This is a serious love story about a little 8 yr old girl and a child molester, who found one another under the worst circumstances possible.<br />
<br />
You see our little Valkyrie crashed her spaceship right on Kazuto&#039;s(the child molester)bath house, killing him in the process. And if this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294695">
        was one of those ridiculous ecchi anime Kazuto would somehow be brought back to life and that&#039;s fucking exactly what happens when-the adult then-Valkyrie decided to give him half her soul to revive him. Of course giving half your soul-as we all know-makes you revert back to your 8 yr old self, so she got stuck on earth not only as a child but as a prisoner of Kazuto&#039;s as well.<br />
<br />
So, if one wondered what the moral of this story is then it would probably be &quot;if you are a bad driver and you kill a pervert let it be, don&#039;t whatever you do stop cause the guilt will take over and you&#039;ll end up as a sex slave&quot;, or something like that. That&#039;s a life lesson you won&#039;t get in the school books so be grateful this anime exists.<br />
<br />
At this point you might think that this sounds ok-ish, sure there&#039;s a child molester but the 8 yr old should be at least a bit cute, right? Right?................WRONG WRONG AND WRONG. Valkyrie as an 8 yr old is the most annoying character i&#039;ve seen to date and not only that she takes incredible pleasure in animal torture as she&#039;s seen in many occassions riding a poor little alien dog and stretching his ears to the other end of the galaxy. BUT here&#039;s the catch..Valkyrie can go back to being an adult once she kisses Kazuto..Yeah...As if this wasn&#039;t braincell killing enough they thought it would be a nice touch to have an 8 yr old kissing a 17 yr old. And there&#039;s a nicer tough to this whole bang and blow bussiness which is the transforming-almost Sailor Moon-esque-scene where we get to witness Valkyrie in all her godly goodness, boingy breasts and an ass so beautiful it can kill you..But don&#039;t worry there are plenty of them babes in Valhalla.<br />
<br />
So we have covered pedo&#039;s and nudity..What else is there? Well, to add some madness to the mix we also have a catgirl. Yup your brain isn&#039;t sending you wrong signals there&#039;s a catgirl straight outta Valhalla...And that isn&#039;t the end of her story as we are shown in her own episode that she is in possession of a ray gun that turns humans into slave cat girls that answer to her and her only..How bloody brilliant is that? And why science hasn&#039;t produced this marvelous weapon of mass erection?<br />
<br />
From there the 3 of them along with Kazuto&#039;s sister, run the bath house which is the new spot for all the weird looking aliens to gather and have a nice bath which in turn means that the average otaku has one more reason to watch this show..Nude aliens of all sizes and shapes. For god&#039;s sake there&#039;s a banana alien with legs..But all was in vain cause everything is ruined by the 8 yr old Valkyrie raiding the place and being absolutely annoying to the point of destruction..And she...She won&#039;t shut up cause she&#039;s the main focus of this show..Well along with stark naked aliens and all..<br />
<br />
This show then, is all about fanservice, catgirls, nude magical girl transformations, opening and closing songs from a kids party from hell, an annoying main female character, a generic and bland as fuck male main and generic as fuck rest of the cast..And almost non existent humour.. Animation was good if by any chance you didn&#039;t close your eyes and ears everytime Valkyrie was ready to open he damn mouth..<br />
<br />
The show sure picks up some speed towards the last eps but it&#039;s not enough and the end of the series left me with a gaping wound in my left hand, a result of me stabbing my self with a fork.<br />
<br />
All in all i think you should avoid this one like you would avoid leprosy.<br />

    Oh god, this show is for real, isn’t it? Welp, this is going to be an interesting review. It’s about an alien girl that crashed into a house, almost killed the person, then gave the person half their soul to save him. She also crashed right in the middle of the bathhouse, separating the men’s and the women’s side. You would think that with that much accuracy, she could of landed fine instead of crashing.<br />
<br />
What is with aliens not knowing how to land and crashing into buildings? Seriously, does no one know how to land a spaceship? It happens almost all the time during the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203185">
        show which makes me wonder if any alien should really be flying at all. If the real world was like this one, then I am scared when we actually end up meeting beings from other worlds.<br />
<br />
Can someone explain to me if this is a dating sim, because it really did feel like it. All the characters that showed up were pretty much stereotypes of characters I have seen in other shows, just not all in the same show. We have the catgirl, the princess who has dedicated herself to our main character, the rival character, the childhood friend, the little sister, and so on. They may not all be fighting for Kazuto’s love but they sure do act like they do sometimes. Actually, sometimes I wonder if Sanada wants to romance Val herself half the time with how upsessed she is with her.<br />
<br />
So the main thing they keep on saying over and over and over again is that ‘Valkyrie gave Kazuto the most precious thing that a girl could give someone…’ AND IT ISN’T THAT PERVERTS! The most precious thing is half of her soul actually but every time they say that line, it just makes me want to face palm. And most of the time they wonder why people get the wrong idea when they say it too. It makes it sound as though they had sex.<br />
<br />
There is one character that I never really understood. It’s that of Kazuto’s… sister… friend… other relative…? They say younger sister on the wiki but they never really explain this well in the show until episode 5. She barely gets any screen time and when she is on screen, it’s just to talk about money until then and we get more of a slice of life story that episode. She is a very average character that really doesn’t stand out at all. Average nerdy girl looks, average nerdy girl problems, and average nerdy girl personality. Example, gets asked by the cutest boy in school (That they say anyway… he looks average to me) but says no because she has to study for entrance exams. <br />
<br />
The artwork is… well it doesn’t look like something that came out in the 2000s. I see it more on par with Ranma or Oh My Goddess more in art style; it’s very typical of that time period. The opening slates seem to be more like Oh My Goddess and I do find some things very similar to that art style but then we get the bubbliest looking scenes that just felt strange. I think this was done with cel drawings because there are many little mistakes I see at times that I think the only way they would have that problem is with cel art. Things like little areas not being colored in right or images that seem to end up looping more then normal. There is also the fact that the foreground is more distinct then the background. When the magical girl thing happens during the transformation from kid Val to Adult Val, we get a little to much detail to her naked body. And this happens at least once an episode it seems weather it is Val or one of her kind. I understand it being a bathhouse, but even outside the bathhouse it seems we are not protected from that. Actually, come to think of it, none of the girls must wear bras as you can see their nipples through their outfits. This is very distracting as they would make me get distracted and not in a good way. Also not really sure about the design of Spottenheim (Shirokenhaimu). Just what the hell is he? Dog/bunny hybrid or something? <br />
<br />
The music is actually really good. I’m surprised that it’s that good compared to the other things in this show. It has the right music to make the scene feel just right. The bad thing about that is that they are unmemorable. I wouldn’t be able to pick them out from any other shows. The opening and ending songs aren’t that bad but they are not memorable either. The only thing that through me off was that in the ending, they had some rather classical music playing over some intense scenes which I’m not sure why. The voices are… interesting. None of them really stood out except for one of the surprisingly deep voice of Shirokenhaimu. There are a couple well known voices in this show like Monica Rial and Luci Christian but they kind of don’t stand out at all. Most of the characters have this rather high pitched voice so I just cringe on every one of them. Greg Ayres actually does a decent job with Kazuto Tokino’s voice as he wasn’t all that bad, just bland. His voice like his personality and his looks do not stand out which seems to be a thing when it comes to harems.<br />
<br />
Now, there are 4 more seasons to this show, and I’m not sure if it was really even needed. The ending of this first season had an ending that could have been perfect to finish it off. It makes me slightly scared to watch the rest of the seasons.

    This anime has a great soundtrack. I have bought every album I could find. I would have bought this anime purely to enjoy the flow of the musical track. The music is not only great by itself, but it is utilized to full effect, imparting whichever atmosphere is called for. Though the story does falter from time to time, the music is solid throughout the show. I truly feel this is a pretty good anime, but without the quality of its music, it would not be worth watching. For instance as princess Valkyrie decides to fly off into space in her UFO the music cut

        in is moving. Of coarse some of the battle scenes make use of &quot;The Flight of the Valkyries&quot;, and other variations on that music by Wagner. I highly recommend this anime, and I recommend the soundtrack even more highly.

    It’s been a long time since humanity unlocked the barrier between t and the infinite cosmos, truly becoming a member of the interstellar community...  Hell, you know it’s been a long time when aliens have even become commonplace in a racially exclusive country like Japan...  And they’ve become such a normal part of our everyday lives that nobody questions the slug monster sitting in the seat  in the back by the window, just waiting to star in his own anime.  But this story isn’t about that slug, it’s about the far more human looking aliens from the planet Valhalla.  There

          <span style="display: none;" id="review207106">
        are eight princesses on Valhalla, each more beautiful than the last...  But none of them are more fair, or more elegant, than the blonde bombshell Valkyrie.  And thus, none of them are more suitable for political marriage.<br />
<br />
With her long, loving link to one loser of a lothario looming in the immediate future, Valkyrie jumps ship, and then crashes that ship into the planet of Earth...  Whereupon her reckless flying has cost the life of one Japanese youth with a bathhouse to run and what should have been a long, happy life to run it.  Feeling guilty for her actions, Valkyrie gives the young man half of her soul, resurrecting him as good as new...  although, due to her own sacrifice, she’s reverted back to a loud-mouthed brat of a toddler!  With the two of them now bound together by a promise much stronger than the red thread of fate, will their newfound romance survive in the face of...  Wait, romance?  How the hell did they get a romance out of that?  Screw this, plot summary over.<br />
<br />
UFO Ultramaiden Valkyire was produced by Media Factory Inc. from 2002 to 2004, around the same time that they did such great looking gems as Ikki Tousen and Green Green.  Yes, this was indeed a dark time for them.  This company HAS produced some great looking shows in both it’s earlier and later years, but the early 2000’s saw Media Factory release some of the cheapest, ugliest looking anime I’ve ever seen, and while Valkyrie’s not even the worst one, it was produced by a company that, at the time, was pumping out consistent crap, a load from which it was no exception.<br />
<br />
To be fair, there are a few impressive looking scenes in this show.  There’s an early scene that features Valkyrie in both child and adult forms dancing in the rain that’s actually kind of beautiful in it’s simplicity.  The transformation scenes, while kind of creepy, are also well done.  But shots like these are few and far between, as the rest of the show just looks awful.  I’ve complained about characters being frozen in the background before, but most shows have the brains to put those frozen characters in positions where they’re standing still looking at either each other or the main characters.  In Valkyrie, extras are frozen all over the place, sometimes in situations where it would be physically impossible to stand perfectly still, like in the pool.  <br />
<br />
Action on screen in minimal, and what action we do get is often repeated shot for shot as recycled stock footage, and I’m not just talking about the transformations.  For the most part, the art is just as bad, with characters constantly off-model, moving in unnatural ways through even less natural spurts of activity.  Their designs are generic and bland looking, at least in terms of the human characters.  The aliens actually do look quite inspired and creative, especially with the awesome designs of the princesses of Valhalla, despite obvious resemblances to Ah My Goddess.  Yes, I noticed.. There is some creativity here, though...  This is a world where giant bananas walk around with legs, and quite frankly, Space Dandy would have a field day here.<br />
<br />
The music, on the other hand, is fine.  It’s not great, but it’s also makes for a pretty pleasant listen out of context.  The variety of beautiful harp and rock-orchestral background tracks work really well with what little material the show gave them, and it was even pretty damn clever how many different versions of the tune Ride of the Valkyries you can spot.  The one they used as the theme for Child Valkyrie is, on it’s own, a lot funnier than the character it was assigned to.  The opening and closing, unfortunately, are nowhere near as impressive.  I don’t hate either of them, there’s really nothing substantial about them to justify more than a couple of watches before just skipping them outright.  I think the biggest problem either one has, despite the catchiness of Itoshi Kakera and the decent groove of Save, is the metallic sound quality applied to both vocalists, which just gave me headaches every time I listened to them.<br />
<br />
The English dub was a decent enough effort by ADV Films, and god bless these actors, they were really trying to make their characters work.  well, most of them were...  I have no idea what Cynthia Martinez was doing, other than overacting and trying to project as much emotion as she possibly could.  Greg Ayres was surprisingly boring in the lead male role of Kazuto, especially considering what he’s been proven to be capable of in other shows.  I honestly blame bad direction for that one.  Monica rial varies up her delivery a little bit, but it’s still a cookie-cutter performance from her.<br />
<br />
I used to be a huge fan of Kira Vincent Davis back in the early 2000’s, back when she was still active and did more roles than just Strike Witches reprisals.  She plays dual roles in this show, both the adult and...  Ahem, child form of her title character, but her performance falls far short of what she was able to pull off in Elfen Lied.  She plays the roles as they’re written...  Boring in her adult form, and nightmarishly obnoxious in child form, which is pretty much on par with the standard the legendary Megumi Ogata set in the Japanese track.  I can SAY that a better actor could have made the character in both forms sound more interesting, but if somebody like Ogata couldn’t do it, then I guess Davis did a serviceable enough job.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, there were a few performances I genuinely did enjoy.  I’ve made fun of Nancy Novotny in the past...  And after Elfen Lied, she deserves it in endless portions...  But she is awesome in the role of the cantankerous Princess Hydra, and the best part is that she even manages to make her character’s child form sound a lot more tolerable than Valkyrie’s.  Some of the only laughs I got from this series were from Christine Auten’s over-the-top turn as Miss Sanada, an obsessive, single-minded maid who has devoted her entire life to serving Valkyrie, especially now that she finds her highness’s child form so damn cute.  I’m honestly not sure how I feel about that, since she’s kind of a terrible character, but we’ll get to that later.  Chris Patton is also on point and very funny as Valkyrie’s louse of a fiance, Prince Triam.  <br />
<br />
I’d say what’s most impressive about this dub are the in-universe songs, all of which were translated into English.  It’s no Beck, by any means, but whoever was in charge of writing these deserves to be commended for their effort.  The director involved also did a great job on these, as they got one hell of an awesomely bad recording of Cynthia Martinez rocking out like there was nobody in the room but her bathroom mirror, which...  Believe it or not...  Was the original intention.  The catgirl songs led by Miss Sanada were also really funny, despite the troubling implications behind them.  There weren’t a lot of huge changes to the script...  The company was still a few years off from Ghost Stories starting that unfortunate trend...  But it’s still pretty impressive.  I would personally recommend the Japanese, but if you’re a fervent dub fan, this one is pretty good.<br />
<br />
Now, having read my thoughts on the English dub, you may have come to the conclusion that I don’t like the two main characters of this series very much.  well, you wouldn’t be wrong.  There are just over a dozen regular or prominent characters in this particular season, and I like a grand total of four of them...  One of which, surprise surprise, is actually in the main cast.  But getting back to Kazuto and Valkyrie, well, they don’t have a single interesting quality between them.  Adult Valkyrie does get some explanation of her personality, insofar as the fact that she bottles up her emotions and pretends to be strong, but that really only comes through in the first episode.  We barely get to see her as an adult, and as a child, she’s just an insufferable whiny little brat who abuses her alien dog, throws tantrums, breaks things, and says creepy things about her relationship with Kazuto that seem specifically designed to be taken the wrong way.<br />
<br />
And as for her knight in yawning armor, Kazuto falls into a very special category for me.  A seriouis pet peeve of mine is when the main character of a story has only one goal:  to preserve the status quo.  I want my protagonists to want something, whether it be love, status, or something they don’t yet realize they don’t need.  Kazuto owns his bath house, and he wants to serve his community with it, and...  Nothing.  The only conflict he ever faces is the possibility of change, which, thanks to constant coincidences, never truly occurs in ways he can’t handle.  New characters appear, shit gets wrecked, and weird things happen to his friends, but as long as his own personal routine isn’t changed, he’s a fairly inactive character.  <br />
<br />
Their relationship, too, is extremely troubling in the message that I sincerely hope I’m misreading...  Kazuto and Valkyrie are in love, despite having nothing in common, no chemistry and him showing no affection whatsoever towards her, and in order to turn her into a much more mature and voluptuous adult, all they have to do is share a magical kiss.  So, if I’m reading between the lines properly, This series is trying to tell us that all it takes to turn a little girl into an adult woman is some intimate contact.  sounds kind of pedophilic to me.  All things considered, I should be rooting for the underdog, Kazuto’s childhood friend Akina...  Because let’s just be honest, the childhood friend is always the underdog in these shows...  But Akina’s only personality trait IS her unrequited love for Kazuto.<br />
<br />
As much as I loved Christine Auten’s acting, and as funny as Miss Sanada’s obsession over Valkyrie’s well-being may be, I just can’t over the fact that she is a literal slave driver.  The first thing she does after landing on Earth is take out a transform an entire legion of unassuming teenage girls into cat girl, complete with ears, a tail, and a complete brainwash to go with them.  She turns them into slaves whose only purpose in life is to serve their extraterrestrial leader without question and likely without payment.  I can’t laugh at this without wondering how their families are being affected by it.  Also, I like the fact that Kazuto’s sister is an over-achiever who tries to manage money to make up for her brother’s sinking of their finances into the bathhouse, and there was some potential for depth with her attempt at having a modicum of a social life, but the series did absolutely nothing with it!<br />
<br />
So who were the four characters I liked?  Well, the most important one was Princess Hydra, the blue-haired fireball who came after Valkyrie when the marriage duty was shifted onto her shoulders instead.  She was turned into a child herself, and from there, she became one of the only characters in the show who had the audacity to call little Valkyrie on her behavior...  And since she’s the only one who’s not in love with Kazuto, she’s the only one who’s able to antagonize her without an ulterior motive.  She’s a lot more entertaining than Valkyrie, in the same way that Donald Duck is more entertaining than Mickey Mouse...  Yes, the latter may be the star and icon of the series, but the former actually faces consequences and does amusing things.  <br />
<br />
Even on a less comedic note, while Valkyrie may say that she was tired of facing the stress and expectations of royal life, it’s a lot more subtle in Hydra’s case, as soon after being turned into a kid, she calms down and accepts it, developing a love-hate sort of sisterly relationship with Akina.  As for the other three?  I’m talking about Marduke, Spottenheim, and Mur, the three little white aliens that I’ve taken to calling The Three Marshkateers.  As soon as I heard that they had a backstory that extended back to some intergalactic war that the three of them were notoriously a part of, I instantly wished I could have seen a spin-off OVA series about them, instead of the piece of shit they were introduced in.<br />
<br />
In any case, let’s get back to my problems with Kazuto and Valkyrie.  Because really, the setting and concept aren’t horrible...  The characters really do comprise at least 80 percent of my beef with this show.  If the pedophilic relationship between them and Kazuto’s refusal to accept change weren’t bad enough, both of these elements are cranked up to the extreme as this season builds up to it’s climax.  I don’t want to spoil the ending for you, but...  No, you know what?  I don’t care if I spoil it.  I’ll spoil, at least, the penultimate episode.   Not how it ends, but how that ending is set up.  If that’s still too much for you, skip the next paragraph.<br />
<br />
While Miss Sanada is making some purchases online, Valkyrie screws around with her laptop and accidentally orders an asteroid.  In their attempts to return it, they find out that there’s a hot spring inside, so they open a hot spring on the asteroid, drumming up brand new business!  But here’s the problem...  The bath water has unexpected healing properties that are giving her her soul back!  And while the rest of the cast struggle to accept this as the good thing that it is, they can’t lie to themselves.  If Valkyrie turns back into an adult permanently, their relationship will stop being a pedophilic, passionless, chemistry-free romance based entirely on guilt over a manslaughter, and they&#039;ll have to carry on as actual adults without supernatural obligations to each other.  This is about the part when my bemusement at how stupid the series was turned into raw anger.  Yes, I know harem shows like to be as chaste and asexual as possible while shoving fanservice in our faces, but this is a depth I wasn’t expecting them to stoop to.  I won’t tell you how this conflict is resolved, but it does in fact involve random convenient coincidences.  Because of course it does.<br />
<br />
Now, hopefully, I’ve already turned a good amount of you off from ever watching this show, but there’s still one group that I know I haven’t reached yet...  The booby hunters.  Yes, fanservice is abound in the anime medium, but explicit fanservice...  AKA, nudity with actual female nipples...  Isn’t that easy to find outside of hentai.  Well, anybody who came into this show through ADV’s advertisements know they were promised lots of naked girls, and if that’s really enough to make a series worthwhile to you, then yes, you’ll find that here.  You can find it in bucket loads...  Provided that you don’t mind naked little kids, badly drawn characters, and constantly recycled animation of random bathing girls with horns on their heads.  Oh, also?  I know the nipples are going to be a big draw for this group of viewers, so let me clarify something else...  There is never any variation in skin tone between areola and breast, making the actual detail you were looking for extremely hard to make out in several scenes. <br />
<br />
In the time that I’ve been reviewing anime, I’ve often heard people telling me that I’m too hard on the medium, and that I take it too seriously.  When I bring up problems, I’m told that i’m nitpicking, and that of course I won’t enjoy a show while I’m taking a negative attitude into it.  When I watch a harem show like this, or Haganai, or Girls Bravo, I’m not supposed to focus on the fact that a creepy woman is filming kids in the changing room, or that she’s basically producing child porn, or that the manager readily accepts her offering of a bribe.  I’m supposed to laugh at how silly the situation is.  In regards to Kazuto and Valkyrie’s relationship, I’m not supposed to pay any attention to the fact that she fled one forced marriage just to fall head over heels for her own reckless driving victim, or that she’s traded one forced loveless romance for another, or that anybody she landed on could have reasonably taken the brunt of her affections...  I’m just supposed to root for them because they’re the main couple.<br />
<br />
Well, I’m sorry it looks like I take my anime seriously...  But I do.  I have standards, and even if you don’t agree with them, I enjoy picking apart a show and experiencing it on a deeper level than most will be willing to reach for.  I like writing down my thoughts, and if I’m proud of how they turn out, I like to post them online for people to possibly read.  That’s why I stick to my guns through a show no matter how much I might hate it.  To be fair, if I’m enjoying a show enough, I may overlook or even forgive it’s flaws.  I saw Yuki Yuna is a Hero a few weeks ago, and I liked the characters, animation and tone so much that I was ultimately able to forgive it for being dumber than a box of hammers and a complete rip-off of a superior series.  I like to pick apart a series without being disgusted by what I find, and i’m sorry, but this series just makes me sick.  Maybe if Kazuto had started the series resenting Valkyrie for barging into his life and forcing the burden of her soul and child self on her, but then learned to love her over time...  well, it would still be creepy, but at least it wouldn’t feel so forced!<br />
<br />
UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie is available stateside in way too many formats.  It was originally released in individual four episode sets, each of which ran for about thirty bucks apiece,.  The series was rescued by Funimation for some ungodly reason...  They probably knew that they could make a mint off of the booby hunters in their audience...  And can be found in thinpack sets, as well as two SAVE sets that cover it’s third and fourth seasons, as well as it’s one terrible OVA episode.  The manga is not available stateside.  I haven’t seen the third or fourth seasons, but I have seen the second, and from what I remember, it was a slight improvement over the first.  I might review it at some point...  Hell, I should, since I bought both seasons.<br />
<br />
In truth, I saw this series ten years ago, at which point I considered it the worst anime I’d ever seen.  It no longer holds that title a decade later, but it’s remained very faithfully in the bottom ten ever since.  In the years since I saw it, I’ve been happy to see it lost in eternal obscurity, and hell, one of the few people I’ve spoken to who’ve seen it was even aware enough of it’s flaws to call it The Pedophile anime.  Others have defended it, calling it funny, which I don’t get.  Maybe these jokes are new to you if you’ve never seen them before, but I have, and they all fell flat for me.  It’s a dreary, uncomfortable series that I knew I’d eventually have to revisit, and yet I still can’t call it completely awful, as it does have a pretty good soundtrack, some much appreciated creativity, and if I’m being completely honest, good pacing too.  But those few good points just don’t save it.  I give UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie a 2/10.
