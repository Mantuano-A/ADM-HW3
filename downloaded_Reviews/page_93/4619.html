    (Disclaimer: The following review may contain spoilers. Please avoid reading this until you&#039;ve watched the whole season. And this time, trust me, it&#039;s worth it.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Healin&#039; Good Precure- The Eighth season I am watching in the Precure Franchise, also the first one where I followed the broadcast from start to end.<br />
<br />
So, I heard a lot of people bash Healin&#039; Good Precure (HealPre) for being the most boring, slow-paced, and the biggest letdown of a season yet? Well- Screw that! Because THIS! SEASON! IS! Not perfect, BUT JUST DOWNRIGHT AMAZING.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s SO good, that I literally cannot say ALL I want to say in the following Review, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401117">
        I may do a full review on YouTube in the future. But for all you MAL users here&#039;s the gist: HealPre, with it&#039;s excellent and in-depth characters, colourful and eye-catching animation, a story with some of the most psychological and greatest messages I&#039;ve seen yet, and SO MANY other things- This rendition is sealing itself as, in my eyes, the best season in Precure History.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
<br />
The idea of HealPre&#039;s general story is surprisingly simple. A nature haven named the Healing Garden is attacked by the Byogens, a force that resembles a magic disease that is trying to infect the whole world.<br />
I say &quot;Idea of general story&quot;, because this is just the tip of the iceberg. Although not much to build on, the crew working behind HealPre seemed to have this incredible magic to milk almost every possible ounce of potential out of this series. It is a powerful season with, as I said, some extremely psychological messages that everyone should lend an ear for listening.<br />
There are A LOT of these messages in HealPre. But perhaps what make this season such a diamond for yours truly is, ironically, a certain disease that killed millions, not in their world, but ours.<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong- Covid-19 is no joke. However, with that, HealPre came out in the right time and place to make it so special. In MANY episodes of HealPre, we see countless reflections of our world under the pandemic. We see the spirit and values of the Healthcare Industry in the healing work of the Precure. We see the struggles of a patient with a disease that cripples them to no end in the story of Nodoka, our main Cure. We see the will of every living being on this planet- The will to live and to survive even when all hope seems lost, from the preseverance of the Cures, the fairies, and the many people we see in the series.<br />
No confrontation has left me more mesmerized and thought-provoked than the final showdown and epilogue of HealPre. The concept that Byogens and humans are no different, to harm nature for the sake of survival and their own benefit- Their own lives. We are a selfish species. But it&#039;s not only our lives we fight for- We fight for the sake of others too. And that includes nature as well. It&#039;s a battle that, so long as we live, we are destined and reponsible to participate in. That brings hope to me more than ever during this daunting era we live in today.<br />
HealPre is a subtlely progressing story on both sides of the conflict, and has a delicate balance between character development, team development, plot progression, and so on. All aspects shine in this lovely present- It&#039;s packaging quite dull on the outside, but on the inside, it&#039;s a gift to me, to all the fans, and to the entire world. A stunning work of art that&#039;s fun, uplifting, and just pleasant to watch the whole way through.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
<br />
HealPre&#039;s animation gives off a relaxing vibe and matches with the pleasant and nicely paced story. A warm and colourful setting and environment helps people engage with the series whenever scenery is concerned.<br />
It achieves a drastic but cool change when switching between the normal episodic story and the weekly fight, from peaceful to epic and bold. Attacks this season were beautiful and are exactly what they&#039;re intended to feel- They are powerful.<br />
Designs for the Cures were perfect for the theme across different forms, and Villains were designed to give off a vicious and antagonizing touch, making their menace well-shown. The upgraded forms of each character are just icing on the cake.<br />
Specific episodes, such as episode 16, 29, 41, and so on, are able to better bring out hidden meanings in the story, both in the episode itself or the overall season through attention to details.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
<br />
HealPre&#039;s background music matches with the mood, the setting, and the animation. It is with music I frequently immerse myself into this already eye-catching season. Continuing its trend of being peaceful while adding a splash of colour here and there, the series treats us to a spectrum of tunes. Enjoy the tranquil tunes in heart-to-hearts and breathtaking scenes. Cheer on the Cures as you jam to the battle themes. Picture yourself in the moment as a catchy country melody plays in the countrysides.<br />
Cool sound effects here and there, like the Cure Touch, the Elements, and all those bling bling moments are just so great to hear.<br />
This section won&#039;t be complete without me mentioning the superb voice acting. Pretty much every main character I can think of has amazing voice acting, most particularly, Nodoka and Rabirin. Rabirin has had her fantastic moments when it comes to her lines (Episode 28). <br />
<br />
<br />
Character: 9.5/10<br />
<br />
This is the part I wish I can detail on, but this review would be way too long if I did. So I will make it hopefully not as long.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll start with Chiyu. In the past, I tend to be less in favor of the Blue Cure, but I really like this one! Not as much as the others, but Chiyu has a great double character arc- Yes, a double arc! Her development was geared towards both as an Athlete and an Innkeeper, and I thought this approach would be messy, but by the end, it seemed as if the arcs joined together perfectly. She is a very independent girl with a strong heart, and she grew into a great person through the series. And while other Blue Cures would have their arc end with them choosing between two life paths, Chiyu actually chose both! That&#039;s new.<br />
<br />
Next, Hinata. Hinata was an extremely fun character to watch, making her my fav. I love her enthusiasm and her clumsiness sometimes, but her insecurity regarding failure is very relatable, seeing her go through the struggles was awesome to watch. She&#039;s just a great girl and entertained me so much, but what&#039;s disappointing was that due to the Covid-19 pandemic causing the show to have a hiatus, it was rumoured that Hinata lost quite a few episodes to the restructuring of the series.<br />
<br />
Then, there is Asumi. Now, I agree with the fandom that Asumi is HEAVILY underdeveloped, which is one of the few problems that I had with this season. But regardless, I actually enjoy watching her very much! Asumi was a character that was strong as a Cure, but not very bright when it came to daily life. I find her humanizing very intriguing.<br />
<br />
And finally, and definitely not least (And I totally did not accidentally leave her out before posting this), Nodoka. I can talk about her for hours- Because she has become the greatest Precure to have ever existed. I shall spare you, dear reader, the pain of reading this long review become even longer. Simply put, Nodoka has the most unique, most powerful, and most emotional story of any Precure Lead to have ever appeared, let alone of any Precure in general. She is a girl filled with endless excitement for things around her, filled with kindness for those she loves. But, she is also fearless, valiant, persistent, and most importantly, a leader at heart. Even today, I still can&#039;t believe it- I failed to find a single crack in her story. Nodoka is my long-awaited peak of character development. And I forever love her for what she had done for this season.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
<br />
HealPre is a fantastic show for people like me, who have been used to the pace of the franchise. It may be slow but it isn&#039;t slow without reason, because this season shows the value of character development to such a critical degree.<br />
Besides that, the characters are just a treat to watch. It&#039;s a team I love watching very much, with all of their interactions from highs to lows. And as Toei continued to blow away my expectations again and again, I was astounded. And I applauded as the series closed with a brilliant and meaningful ending.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 9.9/10<br />
<br />
This season was... Just unbelievable. It has it&#039;s own set of problems, but just about every season past Go Princess, the previous peak, has had huge problems. I would dare to say this time, every one of those huge problems have been fixed and done right.<br />
No Precure season triumphs the real-world reflections that Healin&#039; Good Precure has made. No season has given yours truly more crucial values to carry for the rest of my life. While this season isn&#039;t my favorite season, and it&#039;s not a season I recommend watching if you&#039;re not used to slow-paced anime, I will say:<br />
<br />
Healin&#039; Good Precure is a masterpiece through and through.

    This is my First review here and it was supposed to go on Crunchyroll but they didn&#039;t accept stuff this long SO. In honor of Healin Good coming back from hiatus AND being placed on a legal streaming site, here we are:<br />
<br />
Precure has been a part of my life for a few years (7? 8?) now and it&#039;s always been one of my favorite shows. I love how Precure in general tackles its darker themes in a way that helps children understand while also showing how love, hope, and friendship can change the world and make you strong enough to beat that darkness.<br />
<br />
Healin Good specifically

          <span style="display: none;" id="review347232">
        has become one of my top favorite seasons and hit me especially hard, despite only having 13 episodes right now, purely as a mentally ill healthcare worker during these times.<br />
<br />
From my Twitter: &quot;... [T]his season has honestly been such a blessing. Some of that is subjective, but I genuinely think the way it tackles [living with] chronic illness [(Nodoka and Latte / Rate)] and [neurodivergence (Hinata absolutely reads as having ADHD or something similar that would affect her attention / focus / memory, even if Precure will never state it outright)] so far has been so good and true to life.&quot; I said above that I think it&#039;s wonderful that shows like Precure exist for their target audience - young children. Especially showing children who may be in the hospital, fighting against their chronic illnesses (as Nodoka has) or those neurodivergent children that may feel poorly about their abilities (such as Hinata) that they too can be superheroes in their own lives.<br />
<br />
Finally, as I said before, I&#039;m a neurodivergent adult and a healthcare worker. After coming home from long days at work, worn down and near-hopeless, Healin Good has given me a soft resting space to feel good again about what I do, what I&#039;m trying to do, and why I chose this profession in the first place. It makes me happy. And because of that, Healin Good has endeared itself to me over many of the other seasons (which, don&#039;t get me wrong, I love pretty much every season). <br />
<br />
Even if cute magical girl / children&#039;s shows don&#039;t appeal to some adults, I would still recommend Precure as a good show to share with the children in their lives.

    I found Healin&#039; Good Precure a series which didn&#039;t pretend. It was what it was, and I found it consistent with itself from start to finish. Hilariously topical in regards to the time period in which it was released, perhaps it allowed the season to benefit from a boost in appreciation from my behalf.<br />
<br />
Overall, though, I found it a very solid season. As a matter of personal note, having Aoi Yuuki voice another pink-haired magical girl felt like a blast from the past, and having her be in a magical girl show that isn&#039;t suffering is actually quite refreshing.<br />
<br />
Onto the review! Because the anime was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review381079">
        what it was, the review won&#039;t be as necessarily lengthy. (Except it is, whoops!)<br />
<br />
____<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
<br />
In terms of a magical girl show formula, the story was effective. It had an engaging start, quite a few interesting mid-story arcs and an equally as satisfying conclusion. While linear, it was to its advantage since it didn&#039;t try to go places with its organization.<br />
<br />
It -did- try to pull off some sort of allegiance switch by the end that ended up a little unexpected and out of the blue. While clumsy, it didn&#039;t necessarily impact the story that drastically.<br />
<br />
Healin&#039; Good also benefitted from the reduced schedule imposed by the pandemic&#039;s restrictions, as it was only 45 episodes instead of the usual 49 - that meant less filler, which, while cute, can sometimes feel like a drag.<br />
<br />
However, I did wish they focused more on the human healing aspect of it. While the Green Aesop of &quot;PROTECT NATURE&quot; didn&#039;t feel out of place with the healing animals, I wish there were more aspects regarding actual medicine, in particular with Hinata&#039;s family business.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
<br />
Everything is cute, befitting the series. I particularly appreciated the designs of the mascots - simplistic and adorable, the soft, round shapes making them look like actual plush dolls really worked to their advantage. In terms of Precure outfits, they&#039;re quite cute and don&#039;t feel overdesigned - just the right amount of detail to make them feel like cute warriors.<br />
<br />
As for the attacks themselves, the special moves didn&#039;t feel like they dragged on for an unnecessary amount of time, which is another positive point to the series. Unfortunately, in terms of fight, I feel like while they tried to strike a balance between physical combat and magical wand usage, they sometimes leaned more towards the latter than the former, which I felt like was an unfortunately moot point in all these positive ones.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, the rest is pretty typical of a magical girl franchise.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
<br />
Some of the soundtrack did appeal to me - otherwise it&#039;s pretty standard stuff. In particular, the transformation themes, one of the primary earcatches, are quite appealing this time around. The openings and endings are also quite cheerful and groovy. Otherwise, nothing really particularly struck me as astounding.<br />
<br />
Character: 7<br />
<br />
The precures, as always, are unambiguous forces of good with positives that far outweigh the negatives. The clumsy one of the bunch, Hinata, has flaws which still allow her to be endearing while also allowing us to relate to her. In particular, since I&#039;m quite forgetful and anxious of people around me doing better than I am, I found myself liking her the most out of the cast!<br />
<br />
Otherwise, the episodes don&#039;t delve a whole lot into their psyche, though we get a solid backstory with Cure Grace which allows us to understand much better the reason she is so devoted to her battle - and that helps us consider her the leader of the group! As for the inevitable sixth (fourth?) ranger that arrives halfway through, her immediate power level is counterbalanced by her unusual personality, which allows us to like this quirky addition more and forget that her ability far surpasses that of the other 3 in most occasions.<br />
<br />
I appreciated the villains being villains and having little to no redeeming qualities. Hugtto&#039;s own tragic villains is a tough act to follow for a series like this (see Star Twinkle, who tried and, in my opinion, failed) and having villains that are unapologetically so feels like a breath of fresh air.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9 ; Final Rating: 8<br />
<br />
Between the time period in which it aired, and the various abovementioned points, I found myself really liking Healin&#039; Good as a whole, and think it deserves the rating I gave it. If you&#039;re hesitating on which season of PreCure to start with, I do think this one is a pleasant start as it is easy on the eyes and the mind, and may come in handy to dispel your troubles about the ongoing situation in the world.<br />
<br />
Perhaps there is a hidden Healin&#039; Pretty Cure somewhere in the world helping us?<br />
<br />
(PS: I just realized that I criticized Star Twinkle for the similar things Healin&#039; Good did. Maybe because the primary theme didn&#039;t interfere with the storytelling method? www)

    This is a PRECURE anime. It&#039;s a show geared towards KIDS.<br />
<br />
Therefore, there is no need to be strict on this series. No edge, unlike Madoka or Magical girl site. The franchise isn&#039;t trying to change the anime industry or make something new. They know what they are doing and that&#039;s making wholesome magical girls trying to save the world.<br />
<br />
This means when you go in you are prepared for the mediocre plot and character development. The art is decent, at least it&#039;s better then the date a live series. The show isn&#039;t really about the battle sequences and more about the characters&#039; flaws and how they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review352961">
        overcome them.<br />
<br />
Healin&#039; Precure is actually decent and sometimes have highlights of emotion that got me tearing up. It&#039;s pretty high on the mediocre scale, so it&#039;s worth some of your time.

    Since I finished the series, I wanted to update my review. This review contains spoilers. <br />
<br />
The animation was wonderful, and I loved the backgrounds. However, some episodes had animation that was a bit off. Sometimes the characters looked weird in shots. However, these situations were rare. Over all, the animation was slick and colourful. <br />
<br />
However, if you&#039;re going to watch the series for the action, I wouldn&#039;t advise it. Even the final fight was largely forgettable. There were some good fights, but that was earlier in the series. Later on, the fights were pretty bad. <br />
<br />
Nodoka wasn&#039;t the most exciting lead, but her arc was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review382132">
        well done. <br />
<br />
Next, was Chiyu, the blue Cure. While she was my least favourite of the bunch, I still liked her. <br />
<br />
The yellow precure is Hinata, and she&#039;s by far my favourite. She&#039;s hilarious and had the best episodes. She&#039;s also highly relatable. <br />
<br />
The final, mid-season Cure was Asumi. I found her largely boring. She was like an innocent child for a lot of the series, and she took up unnecessary episodes with her learning new words and feelings. She was also really over powered. <br />
The other Cures were really weak compared to her, and I didn&#039;t like that they weren&#039;t given time to shine.<br />
<br />
I gave the series a higher grade during mid-season, but watching the ending left me with a feeling of lost potential. It&#039;s such a shame the series was so negatively impacted by COVID-19. It makes me wonder what could&#039;ve been, especially in the later episode of the series. <br />
<br />
So, is Healin&#039; Good Precure worth watching? Hmmm... It&#039;s up to you. It was my first Precure series I watched as it was coming out, so it holds a special place in my heart.<br />
I just wish it was better. <br />
<br />
Hopefully next season&#039;s will be more interesting.

    Okay, I&#039;ve been a fan of the Precure franchise since 2019, it doesn&#039;t sound like a lot but I&#039;ve watched a fair amount of seasons in that time. People could say that I would be the demographic for this franchise since I&#039;m a young girl, so that&#039;s why my reasonings for not liking this show are not that strong of points than others but bear with me ;-;<br />
<br />
The story was decent. It&#039;s like any other Precure plot, I don&#039;t have much to say. 4/10<br />
<br />
The art could do better, I&#039;ve seen better in terms of Precure like Star Twinkle, Kira Kira and HUGtto But it was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review381071">
        okay I guess. 6/10<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t really comment on the sound. I really liked the Op and ED1, but the ED2 was just...It was really a downgrade :/ 7/10<br />
<br />
Characters...Okay, this one will be more detailed. So, since this was my first Precure season I will be witnessing start-to-finish, I was pretty hype, especially for the fact that It was the best logo in the series, I was hoping for a Pink and Green duo-it would make sense since Green is to do with health and Earth. But nOoOoOOOoo this is Precure we&#039;re talking about. A duo? A green cure? no way. So I was disheartened to see the Fresh formula, for about the 5th time in Precure. JESUS, can we please change the character colours and personalities up for once?! <br />
Hinata, I liked her..at first. But something just changed about halfway into the season. I hate her now and I have no idea why. Maybe its because I really don&#039;t like dumb characters? (Bad in school kinda dumb) <br />
Chiyu, she&#039;s just a normal blue cure whos sporty this time or something. This isn&#039;t a Cure Ange type character-SHE IS SO FORGETTABLE I EVEN FORGOT HER NAME FOR A SECOND! <br />
Nodoka. Imagine this cast is so weak your favourite is the main character. Nodoka isn&#039;t even that good of a character for me. She&#039;s the main character but she&#039;s kinda quiet for a change but not like Tsubomi type shy. <br />
Asumi. Oh, Asumi. Where do I start? Okay, first what were the character designers doing? Obviously, yeah the Earth is purple, therefore Cure Earth is Purple. Makes sense. Does Precure hate us that much? To make cure EARTH not even green? But enough about her colour. Her personality...WHY. JUST WHY? She&#039;s too dependent on Latte, that&#039;s the problem. It&#039;s as though she thinks the world revolves around Latte, Hell, she literally disappears if she isn&#039;t with Latte. Apart from that, she&#039;s good at fighting yet has no common sense. I just really, really don&#039;t like Asumi.<br />
Overall on characters: 3/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment. I did not get any enjoyment from this show. It&#039;s as simple as that. 1/10<br />
<br />
Overall, 2/10. It&#039;s down there with Doki Doki. Healing Good and Doki Doki are my least favourites. Thank god this is over because Tropical Rouge seems like a season with potential!<br />
<br />
What I wanted in the last episode was to AT LEAST SEE IF THE VILLAINS ARE OKAY! I might have missed the episode where they showed the villains to be okay but I couldn&#039;t care less. I mean the villains were forgettable except for Daruizen, but I always need to know if the villains are okay, especially if one of those villains are my favourite in the whole franchise (cough cough Daruizen cough) I STILL HAVENT GOT THE REDEMPTION ARC FOR HIM-HE DID SOMETHING HORRIBLE TO NODOKA AND HE DIDNT EVEN REDEEM HIMSELF TwT as if I couldn&#039;t hate this season more...<br />
But yeah if you&#039;re reading this trying to see if you want to watch this season, don&#039;t take my word for it. My reasonings and taste are weird after all. But just know there are better seasons out there!!

    This review will cover the first 10 episodes of the season.<br />
<br />
After the entertaining story and cool art of star twinkle precure, i&#039;m a bit disapointed with this.<br />
<br />
story: 5<br />
The story is pretty average: a magical world that heals the earth is attacked by the darkness, and now the pretty cures have to restore it, that will save that world and the earth.<br />
<br />
art: 6<br />
not bad at all.<br />
the animation quality is very good, very good drawn characters and fluid animation all the time; plus it has a very good CGI animation for the ending.<br />
the cure desings, transformations and attacks are fine but still catching for kids and magical

          <span style="display: none;" id="review334719">
        girls lovers.<br />
<br />
sound: 6<br />
catchy opening and ending.<br />
<br />
character: 7<br />
i like the characters and fairies, but not enought development episodes yet.<br />
<br />
enjoyment and overall: 5<br />
<br />
not a bad season at all, i&#039;m liking the characters and though plot is weak, the episodes writing is entertaining.<br />
For now i only can recomend it for magical girls and precure fans.

    *slight spoilers*<br />
Only watch this is if you like Mahou Shoujo animes. Healin&#039; Good Precure is a mess but you can still enjoy it. I started watching when episode 23 aired and have been watching ever since then. After episode 33 it became very uninteresting and boring. <br />
<br />
Story: The story is okay it follows the same story as most other Precures where a fairy comes from their magical home/land which is in danger so they must find the legendary Precures it&#039;s the same as always. Not original but the whole thing about Precure is that they follow the same storyline.<br />
<br />
Art: The art sucks it isn&#039;t terrible

          <span style="display: none;" id="review380778">
        but it&#039;s fair because covid started while the show had begun airing.  Something I find unforgivable though is making half of the element bottles shoot out stupid coloured beams. The leaf element bottle shoots out a frickin&#039; pink beam, not even green PINK. The fights aren&#039;t fluid and since the arrival of Cure Earth the main three girls we start the series with can&#039;t do anything.<br />
<br />
Sound: The sound is really good the purifying attacks have such good music especially the first one that they used for Healing Flower, Healing Stream and Healing Flash. I love the OST that plays when Fontaine fights. The OP is great it&#039;s catchy and sounds good. ED 1 is really good but I hate the part where Grace says &quot;I believe in you, my friend.&quot; ED 2 sucks sorry but it isn&#039;t catchy and it sounds bad.<br />
<br />
Character: In terms of design Grace looks fine, Fontaine is too blue, Sparkle is a mess and Earth is so pretty. Now character&#039;s personalities. Grace is the only one who got development she is the most developed character in the series. Fontaine doesn&#039;t really develop her episodes are so boring -_- her episodes were always either about the inn or about high jumping or whatever she does. That brings us to her issue for two episodes we have to see Chiyu struggle between choosing if she wants to be a professional high jumper or if she wants to become the owner of the Inn. She spends two episodes debating and what is her solution?  She will do both because she loves them both. -_- NOOOO why did you spend that long just for that conclusion. Sparkle didn&#039;t get any development or like any episodes lol so what is the solution? She makes a mistake oh no!!!! Hinata finds out that Guaiwaru left a portal open so she and the girls go to the Byogen Kingdom to defeat King Byogen while he is still weak. But oh no! major plot twist Guaiwaru planned this so he could become the king then the girls are forced to fight him but he is too strong oh no!!! So she blames herself because they can&#039;t escape! Cure Earth was a midseason cure so you would expect her to have the least development which is 100% true. She doesn&#039;t really develop or grow that much but it&#039;s ok because I am biased and I love her even though she is strong for no reason but it&#039;s fine because the girls would be dead without her.  <br />
<br />
Villains: We have 4-5 villains Daruizen, Shindoine, Guaiwaru and King Byogen. They all suck except for Shindoine because she is amazing and beautiful and she is a girl lol. Daruizen sucked they made him look all strong and important but the way he died? sucked. Guaiwaru SUCKS I HATE HIM he is annoying and dumb. King Byogen is just some stupid villain who we just wait to see.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I enjoyed this series so much when I started watching it but the fights were lacking soon after the thirtieth episode we had a week with no episode due to the Healin&#039; Good Precure Miracle Leap movie airing in theatres that day. After that, the fights got a little bit better but the story aspect became so boring we already saw all the good stuff after that it became a very big mess bigger than before but it&#039;s okay. Just watch until the 31st episode and then watch the last 2 episodes because those were the only good episodes. For some reason in every episode, they find a way to make the girls detransform just so they can spend like 5 minutes of the episode transforming which is so annoying.<br />
<br />
Overall this show is an enjoyable mess watch if you please but don&#039;t expect anything amazing.   <br />
<br />

    In the years after magical girl anime came to be, magical girls were pretty popular. Tons of them popped up over the past several decades, abundant with all kinds of creative, crazy ideas that the writers managed to make work. But since the mid-2000s, less and less magical girl anime started coming out because of the genre stagnating, even in Japan. Many magical girl shows that got released after that lacked creativity, were just poorly executed, relied too much on trying to copy Madoka Magica&#039;s success without taking into account what made that show work, tried to be too dark for their own good, or

        never took advantage of their formulas to show great characters. Most are just flat-out dismissed as Sailor Moon rip-offs without even being given a second glance. Even the Pretty Cure franchise, with its massive popularity, could suffer from this at times depending on the season. I myself have only seen a few seasons of it, with Heartcatch still being my favorite because it tried to break those trends, but the franchise is infamous for being rather clingy to its formula, rehashing it over and over again. If you really think about it, Pretty Cure is the only classic-style magical girl series left. I dropped out of Pretty Cure in 2016 due to other obligations and because of certain events that drove me away from the fandom as a whole, and none of the other seasons after Go Princess really appealed to me.<br />
<br />
Then Healin Good Pretty Cure showed up and proceeded to steal my heart in the absolute best ways possible. I have to say: Man! I haven&#039;t been this blown away by a Pretty Cure season since Heartcatch! Granted, I still like the latter better, but seriously, Healin Good is great!<br />
<br />
But before I devolve into my gush fest, I&#039;ll just get the story out of the way: A young girl named Nodoka Hanadera just moved to a new town with her family. After spending years stuck in the hospital due to a crippling illness, she&#039;s finally cured and is ready for a fresh new start in life. But on her first day there, a mysterious monster attacks, and she encounters several cute, tiny talking animals, who say they&#039;re from a magical place called the Healing Garden. They&#039;re in trouble because the Byogens, a mysterious syndicate, decimated their world and have plans to infect the Earth as well, but need the help of superheroes called Pretty Cure to stop them, as they&#039;re powerless on their own. Nodoka, alongside three other girls, Chiyu, Hinata, and Asumi, wind up becoming the magical girls known as Pretty Cure. Their mission is to fight the Byogens and make sure they don&#039;t revive their king, who could very easily destroy everything the people of Earth and the citizens of the Healing Garden hold dear.<br />
<br />
Now, the timing for this series is rather...creepily coincidental. A magical girl anime with a heavy emphasis on health, nature, and environmentalism, with the bad guys literally being sentient diseases/viruses just so happened to come out during a literal plague that&#039;s still running amok across the world. Yeah, no thanks, COVID-19. Although, to be fair, the people at Toei obviously had no way of knowing that a pandemic was going to happen, and they already had their plans for the series laid out, so it wouldn&#039;t have been possible for them to change everything completely. Hell, Healin Good even got delayed for a couple months because of the pandemic, which resulted in a lot of Toei&#039;s plans for the series getting cut, even down to the number of episodes it has. But even with that, Healin Good Pretty Cure is still a great show for what it is. Now, not everyone will agree, as every Pretty Cure fan has their own favorite and least favorite series, and that&#039;s okay!<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s talk about the technical stuff, starting with the animation as I normally do. Now, I&#039;ve only seen several Pretty Cure seasons, with each one having a different approach to their animation. Some seasons bring out all the colors and all the dynamic character animation, both in the slice-of-life scenes and in the action scenes, while others tone them down to focus on the backgrounds, the CGI, and the flashy beam attacks. While Healin Good might not have as much expression and dynamicism as something like Heartcatch, its animation still does a perfectly fine job at what it needs to do. The background art is slightly muted, typical for Pretty Cure, the action, the hand-to-hand combat, and attack animations are always stellar to watch, and it&#039;s not as heavy on the CGI this time around. It also helps that the character designs are more simplistic for the girls this time around, what with the girls in their normal forms having regular hair colors, having less embellishments on their Cure forms, and I love how they incorporate doctor coats into the transformation sequences, along with other heavy usages of medical imagery, like Hinata&#039;s family owning a vet clinic. That said, I do think the monster designs are rather stupid looking. Not as stupid as the Akanbes in Smile Pretty Cure, but I wish the creators had done more with their monster designs.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is where things normally get sketchy. I mean, I liked the opening and ending songs for Healin Good, as they&#039;re all well sung and the CGI dancing sequences for them are top notch. But Toei has had this tendency to reuse music from previous series in other ones when it makes no sense for them to do so, especially battle BGMs, which feels lazy to me. Having not seen much of the Precure shows that came out immediately before Healin Good, I can&#039;t exactly comment on that one, as I don&#039;t know if HG actually reused previous series&#039; music, but I will say that Healin Good&#039;s soundtrack is definitely one of the better ones. Light piano tunes, heavy metal during the fights, jazzy saxophone numbers, triumphant trumpets, every piece of music fits the show and its atmosphere when needed. Shiho Terada definitely deserves more love as a composer, and I hope she gets more work. She got recruited to do the music for Tropical Rouge coming next, so I can&#039;t wait to hear what she does for that!...though knowing Toei, they&#039;ll probably make her reuse music from this series.<br />
<br />
The characters are a mixed bag, but when I say that, I don&#039;t mean that the main characters are poorly written. In fact, the main Precure girls are actually the best part of this entire show. One other thing Pretty Cure as a franchise tends to have problems with is its characterization, particularly giving everyone unequal amounts of focus and development even when it&#039;s not needed. For example, Doki Doki Pretty Cure was infamous for shilling its main character while refusing to give others meaningful screentime and development. This trend has unfortunately continued for other seasons, like Hugtto and Star Twinkle. Thankfully, from what I&#039;ve seen, the Healin Good girls and the animal mascots all have their fair share of focus, development, and growth as characters, and even when some don&#039;t necessarily have whole arcs, they&#039;re all immediately likeable from the start and the entire series focuses on portraying them as sweet, down to earth girls with their own colorful personalities, strengths, weaknesses, and character flaws when they&#039;re not fighting monsters, making them feel much more like people you&#039;d see on the street rather than cutesy over-the-top caricatures. It also helps that Healin Good eschewed simply introducing new characters willy-nilly and kept the focus solely on the girls, the mascots, and their immediate families and friends, and even here the series delivers, portraying them all impeccably and never going for cheap, easy ways to resolve their problems. Granted, some may take issue with the way one character is randomly introduced in a rather Deus Ex Machina-esque way, but the show does make up for that by having said character actually overcome issues that arise from said introduction (And getting some fairly cute comedy out of it, too!). Basically, all the characters are wonderfully fleshed out.<br />
<br />
...Except for most of the villains. I say most because one of them gets more development than the others, and is actually one of the better villains in the show because he has a direct connection with one of the protags and is the reason she&#039;s in this fight in the first place, making her reasons for fighting feel much more personal and giving it more stakes rather than fighting him because he&#039;s evil. You&#039;ll know who I&#039;m talking about. That being said, other than him, the other villains...aren&#039;t that great. They&#039;re not as one-note as the villains of Mahou Tsukai Precure, but the big bad is mainly hidden throughout the show and the other two don&#039;t really change much throughout the entire show, with the only female among them being little more than a haughty sycophant who can&#039;t even hold her own against the Pretty Cure, even with multiple power-ups. This is one reason Healin Good hasn&#039;t quite beaten Heartcatch as my favorite Pretty Cure series, because Heartcatch actually put in the effort to give its villains much more depth, personality, and chances to shine. Basically, Healin Good has great protagonists but gave its villains the shaft save for one.<br />
<br />
(Update, 2/15/2021: Okay, apparently there&#039;s an interview with the HealPre staff that mentions that they had intended to make the villains sympathetic and give them more depth, but with COVID-19 going around, they figured doing that would be in bad taste so they decided to nix the idea, along with being forced to ax a bit of Hinata&#039;s character development. Can&#039;t really say I blame them for that first one)<br />
<br />
But even with that, Healin Good&#039;s writing, while not perfect, is top notch. I feel it&#039;s the most consistent series in the Pretty Cure franchise with how it knows what it wants to be, what its themes are, and never trying to do more or less than it wants to do, or biting off more than it can chew, something other Precure shows have done to their detriment (*coughcoughHappinessChargeandMahouTsukaicoughcough*). I never found myself outright disappointed with any episode nor its execution or writing except for just two, and even they weren&#039;t necessarily bad episodes. One of those episodes did have the problem of trying to combine two storylines rather than just focusing on one and getting the proper mileage out of it (It&#039;s the one called &quot;Gloomy Natasha!&quot; Speaking of that, the show never did explain why Hinata and her friend Eriko referred to each other by English names/nicknames. Seriously, what is up with that?!), but other than that, I found Healin Good to be fairly consistent, which is especially notable because various other seasons&#039; quality tends to fluctuate wildly, or wind up making some weird writing decisions that detriment parts of, or the rest of the show. Healin Good has remained fairly consistent and down-to-earth all throughout its run, though not without a few bumps in the road. Still, it deserves praise for sticking to its guns and just being an overall fun, heartwarming, touching children&#039;s show that deserves way more love than it gets! If you&#039;re new to Pretty Cure and wanted to start on one of the seasons, definitely give this one a try!

    Before I give my review, let me just say that I&#039;ve watched every single episode, special and movie of the Precure franchise up to this point. :) <br />
<br />
<br />
Visuals: <br />
1) pretty to look at <br />
2) the animation seems to be done by amateurs. The reason why I say this is quite simple. There are 3 characters that are talking animals, like every single Precure season and just like in every Precure season, these talking animals must hide from regular people. In this season, however, we see regular people approach our Precure girls, their magical partners slowly hide and the next frame... they&#039;re in plain sight of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review422490">
        every single non-Precure human. I don&#039;t understand how this happens constantly throughout the season and it&#039;s immersion breaking. <br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
1) excelent casting for most roles but the dog&#039;s voice is too annoying <br />
2) soundtrack is okay <br />
<br />
Characters and story: <br />
1) the girls are a bit too generic for the most part but they had good chemistry between them until the 4th one was revealed <br />
2) I&#039;d say the first 5 episodes are interesting. Then it starts having the same old Precure problem: too damn repetitive and too long <br />
3) The ending arc has a few twists and turns that I didn&#039;t expect and it freshed things up... until it all fell apart because someone backtracked (I&#039;m referring to whoever decides where the story goes next) and made it another boring, repetitive ending <br />
<br />
<br />
As much as I appreciate the seiyuus&#039; performances, I would be lying if I said that I enjoyed watching this. It&#039;s a 5/10 from me.

    Its curious that in a very difficult year with a virus we know, quarantine and so much caos a season with the main theme of purify and the earth must be healed. The dynamic is simple: one of the members of the king “sickness” a spirit that usually is hidden in an object: a tree, water, or a house. With the sickness, the corruption expands unless Cure Grace and the team purify him. Every time this happens Latte also gets sick.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I liked about this season is that each character complements each other and the dynamics of each other is very fun. Unlike other animes,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420369">
        that mention that a character has an illness and doesn’t explain what is this, Healin’ Good really explains the mysterious sickness of Nodoka.<br />
<br />
As the tradition, at the mid season a new character comes and joins the team. This time is Asumi, Cure earth, a spirit, she is the partner of Latte. She really doesn’t know how to act properly as a human, so she needs to learn too much things. Also some episodes also dedicate time for Asumi to learn some words, like love or cute. As an adult this can be boring, but let’s remember that this is a kids show.<br />
<br />
Some episodes, since Asumi, Cure Earth join the group are really difficult to watch. She is a spirit learning how to be a human and this means learning the meaning of some words. One time is fun, two is ok, but 3 and more can be really tired. <br />
<br />
Music can be good, but if I am honest in the Precure franchise past season have better soundtrack. Yhis is also the oP and ED titles.<br />
<br />
As a conclusion this season is good. The writing and character and character development is really amazing. The characters has weakness, doubts about their future, about friends and their duty about being Precure. They are realistic characters. Is a season I can recommend for someone that doesn’t know with which season begin
