    An underappreciated factor when looking at any individual anime series is the nature of its source material, provided it has one. Original anime (like the original Madoka series) are practically guaranteed to have a beginning, middle and end, but when based on a source, there’s certain elements that become byproduct by the source’s nature.<br />
<br />
When anime are produced based on ongoing manga, one can exact lingering focus on iconic shots and a tendency to go on and on as long as it takes. Light Novel adaptations tend to feature basic protagonists bereft of the thought focused complexity their written works offer. Videogame based anime often have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333264">
        very specific factors emblematic of their origin, and of those adaptations, an increasingly common source of anime recently are gatcha games: free to play games tailored to get people to dump money to gamble for character growth and collection. For the sake of providing business revenue, these work fine, however scummy they are, but what happens when transferring that mentality to a non-interactive medium where quick story is the most important?<br />
<br />
That‘s the main issue with Magia Record. Despite the admirable effort from the artists and Yūki Kajira, Magia Record’s characters and plot structure are held back very far, likely by how a TV series must accept its mobile game design mentality. Rather than be allowed to freely express like its main series counterpart, it winds up feeling substance-less, focus-less and ironically, far closer to a traditional Magic Girl series. <br />
<br />
Because of the nature of this show, I’ll judge the series by two angles, one as its own story, and one as a companion to the Madoka franchise it proclaims itself a side story of:<br />
<br />
As its own story:<br />
<br />
The first episode seems to establish the plot focus about this girl named Iroha Tamaki, who happens to have Madoka’s color palette. As a magical girl fighting mysterious creatures, she’s trying to find her sister named Ui: supposedly the reason why she became a magical girl in the first place, but whom no one else remembers. It also introduces a girl named Kuroe, seemingly a friend of Iroha’s who already made her wish to become a magical girl, but the circumstances didn’t last. Strong start, but rather than go any further with Kuroe, she is quickly removed from the series to spend the next two episodes on a hastily rushed conflict between two new characters the audience is given no time to care about.<br />
<br />
This leads to Magia Record’s greatest sin as its own plot: focus. The show has a severe issue with understanding what deserves attention. Rather than having a central drive that every element works towards, the series instead focuses on several smaller stories that are both underdeveloped and have little to no lasting payoff. Top this off with an overabundance of character designs, likely present to convince players of the gatcha game to grind for them, and you have a series with only the thinnest connective tissue.<br />
<br />
See, Episodes 2-3 start and resolve the conflict of two characters. Episodes 4-5 introduce another character in a place that seems relevant but is quickly forgotten after. Episodes 6-7 focus on yet another character’s conflict to create and resolve. Episodes 8 to about halfway through Episode 10 do the same for another character who becomes irrelevant immediately following. During this time, over 10 other supposedly significant characters are introduced claiming to have a reason for existing and not getting to do anything beyond stating exposition. Episode 11 is purely an excuse to bring characters to a location, while Episode 12 explains the magical girl system of the series. Not showing by example, telling how the magical girl system works. <br />
<br />
In all this time, there is zero progression on Iroha’s goal to find her sister, which keeps her as a one-note character who has nothing else to define her or drive her drama: a puppet to tour through various disconnected plots without anything interesting learnt about her in the slightest. Heck, we don’t even get to know what her relationship to Ui WAS like in order to flesh her out some. This causes the series as a whole to effectively have a non-plot: with no active villain, clear solution or ticking clock. <br />
<br />
Suppose you could argue the Wings of Magius fills the villain role, essentially a magical girl Illuminati, but they function more as a recurrent obstacle than an active villainous force, with new members being introduced left and right, a confusing morality position and no real intricate planning. In episode 11, one of its members even cutely panics when questioned.<br />
<br />
To make matters worse is the effect on the pacing and character interactions this non-urgency has. The arcs don’t have enough time to simmer before the next one immediately follows, and more characters bloat the cast. Even if characters like Sana and Felicia had any interesting character moments or traits during their arcs, they are quickly forgotten by the time their arc ends with no further advancement, which leads to very boring character interactions between Iroha and her friend group separating the arcs. The only recurring character who acts consistently different enough from the rest is Yachiyo as the group’s senior. She has her own conflict regarding a friend that joined the Wings of Magius but it’s forcibly restrained by the show’s lack of focus. I never got the sense that her plot had development or follow-through when it’s scattered in bits and pieces across other soon to be irrelevant plots.<br />
<br />
Going into the series as its own thing, the first cour presents it as a visually-stylized and musically strong, but basic, segmented, plotless and unfocused series where nothing is given the impact it deserves. Then there’s how it compares to the original show.<br />
<br />
As a spinoff of Madoka Magica:<br />
<br />
When it comes to how it compares to the near decade old series it spun off from, it’s even less effective. On a positive note, it does retain a lot of the artistry from the original. The characters all look cute and have colorful outfits with several nice little details. Certain episodes have the occasional cool cinematic shot, Kamihama City is often painted orange by the sunset and while the Witch Realms aren’t as specially themed as those presented in the original, the otherworldly stylization around them is retained, particularly in episodes 5 and 7. Similarly, Yuki Kajira does a competent job with the soundtrack. It again, isn’t nearly as memorable as that of the original series for me, but it did a good job adding epicness to certain combat encounters when the writing can’t.<br />
<br />
Other than that though, the similarities feel skin deep. While Madoka Magica felt like a harrowing character story told through the lens of the common magical girl setup, Magia Record IS the common magical girl setup with only the occasional lasting dark drama moment. <br />
<br />
While the original show avoided the chance to make the common Magical Girl squad by creating personal conflict rifts between prospective members that grew and changed, this show forms its core team almost immediately and forms it arc by arc in a similar way to any standard Magical Girl show, but without the standout traits for each member. Light conflicts never affect the ties that bind. Hell, Magia Record’s introduction of Dopples muddies the well-established nature of the Witches, since Iroha’s soul gem goes dark to become one, only to have the process quickly reversed. <br />
<br />
There are a lot of things you can say about how well the original show pulled off what it did, but one element that can’t be denied was its focus. In its 12-episode run, it was able to properly pace itself so that the storyline and theme evolution moved along at a steady clip. The main cast was kept small; characters only got focus when it was important in the long-term and character action correlated with the show’s themes. When Sayaka’s arc took focus, it had significant focus over several episodes with a resolution that filtered out several dramatic twists by showing them to us by Episode 8. These same twists are shown in Magia Record Episode 12, with the panache of an elementary school lecture divorced from any and all interesting drama. Almost appropriate that the episode was titled “Why is this so unbearable?”<br />
<br />
Somehow, Magia Record even managed to bungle some of the elements I took issue with in the original series. To some, Madoka was a bland character without much personality or presence herself. But you could argue the simpleness of Madoka’s character was intentional, since the plot challenged her all loving heroine ideals. There was a clear sense that all the conflicts and gut punches shaped her decision making as the “main” character up until the story’s conclusion. She could’ve been uncertain or insecure or “whiny” but those played off of her established character. <br />
<br />
Iroha has none of those things. She’s a bit more assertive than Madoka was but nothing about her character or way of thinking changes in the series. She maintains the same sense of non-personality the entire series, never having any interesting character development, never changing her goal, never making meaningful choices, etc. Madoka carries herself in the story because of her flaws; Iroha is purely carried by separated scenarios. <br />
<br />
Then there’s the worldbuilding. The small scope of the original series was something I was initially critical of since it implied the Magical Girl system was a constant worldwide, but we only saw one city. Magia Record does conceptually improve with new worldbuilding points, like a Magical Girl Hall of Justice of sorts in Kamihama and the Wings of Magius, but even then, they’re not really fleshed out beyond existing. Characters from this secret base get the paltriest amount of screen time and character depth in the series.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, the original Madoka series was 12 episodes and it managed to tell a complete story within that time. This show ends desperate for a second season even while spending ¾ of this season on events that don’t matter to anything in the long run besides showing off blandly undeveloped character designs. The final episode tops it out by desperately overloading itself with fanservice that&#039;ll only make sense with the original in mind in a desperate plee to get OG series fans to stick around.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
<br />
While flaws in the actual narrative could fall on the video game’s writers, the way it’s presented makes it feel like it was limited by being a mobile game in ways not adaptable for its strengths. Go full stop quantity over quality with the characters, since they’re just ways for people to sink money into upgrading and collecting them. Make the plot scenarios separated so they can support short-burst gameplay with grinds in between. And throw in characters from the original series like Mami and Kyoko regardless of how well they actually fit to heighten appeal.<br />
<br />
I’m tempted to give the show a higher score on the basis of its animation talent (maybe so without Episode 12). Shaft’s directors are likely trying the best they can, but you can get the animation experience by watching good AMVs on the series. And honestly, out of other shows where the stellar animation quality far, far outweighs the writing on display, like Guilty Crown and Demon Slayer, at least those had consistent story tracks to make the animation highs meaningful in context despite their narrative fumbles. This didn’t have that. All it had to do was bank off the goodwill of the franchise’s prior success and put talented artists on the project to be a success, regardless of how much effort actually went into this being a TV series. Magia Record on its own is a bland and very unfocused Magical Girl series and practically a lesser knockoff of the original Madoka Magica. I am very disappointed with how this series turned out, as it feels like even at this stage, the story could have been more substantial.

    Magia Record is not Madoka 2.0.<br />
<br />
I feel like that really needs to be said.  Despite “side story” written in the title, being a part of the Madoka franchise comes with huge expectations--expectations that Magia Record never attempts to meet.  This is not a sequel to Rebellion, nor an attempt at recreating the magic (heh) of Madoka.  After all, the original was practically a statement for mahou shoujo and was such a groundbreaking and well-acclaimed series, you only really get one of it per genre.<br />
<br />
This doesn’t excuse all of Magia Record’s potential faults, but I think a large wave of backlash towards it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333258">
        is largely based on comparisons to the original.  It’s not even really clear how MR relates to the original series, it is just a story using premade rules and concepts of the original series, so although it’s not something you should watch without seeing Madoka, it exists as a seemingly separate entity.  Stop bullying Magia Record, it did nothing wrong.  Just like Kyuubey.<br />
<br />
Now, as for Puella Magi Magia Magica Mahou Madoka Gaiden Getcha Gacha Godoka Gotcha Record Shoujo (TV) (2019) itself, there are actually lots of problems just on their own.  For example, the story jerks you around and doesn’t really stick to one plot thread; while the overarching narrative is Iroha figuring out the mystery of her missing sister, it gets distracted by all of the other character arcs and thematic concepts that it’s easy for you to forget it yourself.  Sometimes a reveal happens and you’re like “Oh.  Yeah.  That was a thing, I guess.”<br />
<br />
And while I can’t say the story itself is bad, it leaves you in the dark for a long time--so long that it only reveals its cards towards the very end of the season, meaning things won’t really pick up until the inevitable sequel.  Not that I’m unfamiliar with stories getting better as they go along, but with the helter-skelter plotline, it could be difficult to invest yourself with what’s going on.<br />
<br />
What about the characters?  Well, they’re… usable.  Iroha is rather plain as a main character, but Yachiyo’s maturity along with her development are pretty strong.  Tsuruno’s passionate excitement and Felicia’s rowdiness also make for plenty of fun moments, but it’s not necessarily a cast that dazzles.  There’s no standout star (because Alina Grey only has one scene 0/10 trash anime), but there wasn’t any character who was particularly bad, or even forgettable.  It helps that everyone has a memorable design, whether it’s a good design or not.<br />
<br />
“U gave it a 7 but complained all the time bruh moment” Yeah, here’s the oddity of Magia Record.  There’s not a lot on this base level that really draws me in or is worth celebrating.  But, damn, can this show be a blast to watch.<br />
<br />
Gekidan Inu Curry takes the director’s seat (or, seats, rather), originally just doing design work for the series and other Shaft works when things need to get extra fucky.  And damn, does this duo deliver.  Every moment of Magia Record has some sort of presence, for lack of a better word.  They bring in every Shaftian trick in the book, like backgrounds cluttered with one object copied infinitely, or mysteriously empty, stark environments, and uncanny CG is used liberally.  It’s nothing short of odd, and most of the time it’s downright unsettling, even in many casual instances.<br />
<br />
That’s nothing compared to the abstract visuals of rumors and witches and fantastical scenes of exposition.  I don’t even know what to say to pitch them in a succinct way, all I know is that this anime trips you the hell out in so many areas.  Characters are framed and positioned, lit and posed in eye-catchingly brilliant ways, or they converse in the Monogatarian manner of “doing what the fuck ever” while they speak.  Easily the best thing about Magia Record is how it’s presented, as it promises to engage you with every second.<br />
<br />
It even comes to a fault, as Gekidan Inu Curry’s lack of anime direction shows with some inconsistencies.  These could be basic things like animation errors and cut-corners, which can be very noticable (but also could be blamed on Shaft themselves, which I hear ain’t doin’ so well these days), but sequences and cuts can sometimes be incredibly messy and disorganized.  This becomes especially true with action scenes, which devolve from being irregularly captivating like much of the rest of this series, to absolute clusterfucks where it’s borderline impossible to follow along.<br />
<br />
Still, the ambition of Magia Record’s presentation cannot be overlooked, as it is the true selling point of the anime right now.  The soundscapes help bolster these beautifully jarring visuals by mirroring their strangeness, most notably when rumors are described through an erratically pitched voice.  The soundtrack might not live up to the incredibly high precedent that Yuki Kajiura set in the original Madoka, but it faithfully recreates the celestial tone it’s best known for.<br />
<br />
Overall, Magia Record certainly has its share of issues and can be disappointing for not comparing well to its original series.  Yet, I can’t help but praise it for how well it was presented.  The best parts are that it didn’t screw up a lot--at worst, it was just mediocre.  Although gacha games are labeled as “cheap” by many (fair), this adaptation was actually a significant improvement over a largely boring game.  The passion presented by Gekidan Inu Curry in this project really shows, and I expect it to be even better when it returns.<br />
<br />
If anyone is playing the game and wants to add me, my Player ID is cWUz52LU.  My supports are pretty decent, and one of them has a cute witch hat but she’s not in the anime so basically what I’m saying is that this anime sucks actually goodbye. Also the game closed so this was completely pointless. Nothing has any meaning and everything is suffering. Die.<br />

    As a big fan of studio Shaft and the original Madoka, i realy wanted to love this one. Not seeing Gen Urobuchis name anywhere near the project had a little red light going off in the back of my head, but i thought Shaft would still handle it in a decent way. <br />
<br />
The structure is odd and switches from a fast to a very slow pacing, seemingly at random. Heavy dramatic scenes are followed by parts that seem to ignore the moments before, sometimes with the same characters in new locations, a light hearted feeling and nobody even mentioning the dramatic stuff that happend just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327460">
        happend seconds before. It feels heavily disjointed to say the least.<br />
<br />
We know little about the characters, relationships, feelings, history or motivation, but that doesn´t stop the drama nor the story from demanding that we care about them anyway.<br />
A good example would be an argument early on between two girls we have seen about 3 minutes on screen who start to insult each other and it is ending with them ending their friendship. ,,So they were friends. Good to know.&quot; I thought right after the fight was over.<br />
We learn a bit about some character later on, but the very most figures of the rather huge cast get no love at all and these who do get their time in in the spotlight are still pretty underdeveloped.<br />
<br />
The worldbuilding has a rocky start too. You get a monolog explaining the core elements of this world in the first episode, but even with knowledge of the original series you have way more questions than answers of why things are happening or what these things are. They introduce new, often times quite interessting ideas constantly, but instead of explaining anything they purposely hide things from you and not in a suddle way like the original Madoka, where everything made sense on it´s own and new informations just changed your viewpoint. <br />
Here they stop explanations by just ending the scene, or they establish something to break the established rules moments later, or explain something with great care just to forget about it completly.<br />
<br />
The mystery story at it´s core was promissing and some of the character are still enjoyable, even without being fleshed out at all. It´s not a disaster or anything but it isn´t on the same level as the other Shaft anime you can find not so suddle references to either.<br />
<br />
<br />
The core problem of being a Madoka spinn off doesn´t help either. The name, setting, cover art, character arcs and even character and whole conversations are ripped out of the original but without the good writing or built up of it. What is left is a confusing work with no emotional impact, a story that goes nowhere, mysteries that were either not resolved at all or just got explained with -she is smart, she invented it-, characters you couldn´t care less about and references to better Shaft productions. <br />
It was probably supposed to be something between Madoka and Hanamonogatari, sadly they pretty much butchered it. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Don´t bother with this and rather watch the original Madoka, the movies or Monogatari if you want to see a story like this made competently. <br />
If you liked the stil and want to scratch your head in confusion you could also watch Fate/Last Encore, which has a lot of similar problems but at least something like a conclusion.

    This is an anthology series set in the Madoka universe. Okay&gt; &gt;<br />
<br />
But believe me, I wanted this to be another impeccable entry in Madoka Magica’s ever-expanding library of consistently high quality spinoff titles (except for Suzune). I wanted this to be a bonafide 10/10 for me. <br />
<br />
Sadly, as you might see in many reviews, this series suffers from pacing issues that unfortunately buries any of the genuine Madoka-esque greatness that is there to people who aren&#039;t as passionate for the brand. While this story isn’t nearly as bad pacing-wise as the original Oriko Magica, nor does its narrative and characters stoop to be as collectively

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333282">
        shallow as Suzune Magica’s, there are undeniable flaws in the first half of this series’ guaranteed 25-ish episodes that I’d be remiss to ignore. And yet, I could say the same for those so blinded by dissatisfaction that they look away from what Magia Record does right. Because it does do quite a bit right - it does many elements of a higher quality than most. <br />
<br />
Let’s break it down by the element, with the final entitled “STORYTELLING/PACING” preceding my overview and going more into detail about the aforementioned problems. However, if you wish to know why, despite these flaws, I still rate this a strong 8/10, I implore you to read my full review leading up to the final overview. <br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: <br />
<br />
The biggest draw of any Madoka spinoff, especially those involving the OG girls, are the characters: who they are, what their outfit says about their self-perception, how their magic and weapon relates to their wish, what their wish says about them, what their Witch form says about them, what they believe in and prioritize, all of it. These aspects have always lent a big hand in giving even the original girls the depth and nuance that hardcore fans love them for. <br />
<br />
Thankfully, I feel this aspect of the storytelling is one of the strongest points in Magia Record’s favor. I don’t know about you, but my favorite part of the original Madoka was what the characters left unsaid, and how that characterized them. For example, Mami’s nice but lonely apartment spoke of her accommodating nature and desire to provide a comfortable space in the sadly-unlikely event of guests spending time with her. Kyoko’s astonishment at having forgotten why she became a magical girl in the first place - that being the belief that she herself can make miracles happen - says much about how seldom introspective she became as a defense mechanism, until Sayaka crashed into her life and reminded her of the same beautiful, naive optimism she long-since stuffed down. <br />
<br />
In much the same way, Magia Record uses these subtle cues to characterize its massive cast of girls. The main heroine, Iroha, comes off as polite and dainty in the first episode, as well as compassionate in the way she prioritizes saving a cat. But in that same episode you realize how docile she is around her magical girl partner, as well as her classmates. You realize that isolates her from her peers, how she’s used to being servile because her parents seem to always be away, leaving her to care for a sickly little sister who, until she was forgotten by everything, was Iroha’s only purpose for living. <br />
<br />
Her boldness in later scuffles characterizes Iroha as not only desperate to attain this familiarity again, but to achieve a semblance of autonomy and spirit to make up for being so weak—a facet brought up in virtually every fight where, despite boasting an impressive machine-gun-crossbow, her painfully weak yet persistent attacks speaks of Iroha’s feeble, distancing behavior, as does her docile-seeming priestess attire: a follower, not a leader to be sure, one who used her only wish to heal her reason for being: Ui Tamaki. <br />
<br />
The main five girls (and you can tell who they would be by their numerous focus shots in the opening) are all given this treatment. Some are stronger than others, while Tsuruno - a gutsy yet chipper girl with delusions of grandeur - spends the majority of this first cour being an extra body in fights with only two brief moments of hidden pain in her debut episode (#4) that isn’t hinted at again before the finale. <br />
<br />
This sort of characterization is a necessity, as this story boasts a hulking cast of at least 20 named characters, including the OG five. Half of them are just villainous mooks as of right now, though still characterized by what’s around them and how they act, what they verbally prioritize. Others like the mysterious Coordinator, Mitama, are hardly shown and when she is we only ever learn that she has strange taste in food, and that’s disappointing.  <br />
<br />
Not every character needs to be rich in depth, however, especially characters like her and Momoko—a big-sister-type to two, stronger-written girls. These ancillary characters serve their role as needed by the narrative, while having just enough to them that they don’t feel like plot devices, but people with their own stories and self interests that just aren’t important to Iroha’s story. After all, it’s important and preferable for minor characters to feel more like real people instead of plot devices, so any characterization is good characterization. I would have a problem if we were given Momoko&#039;s backstory despite how little time we actually spend with her.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, while some might feel the inclusion of the original five girls is unnecessary fan service, as of now only three had any real involvement, and all of them feel necessary for the story and logical for their characters. In this sense, I think they are used well in a story where their absence would honestly feel more jarring, given the stakes looming in the background. Not only do they feel like active players swapping information behind the scenes (as their dialogue implies), but their roles stand as testament to the spinoff’s overarching theme (which has its own section below). <br />
<br />
SETTING: <br />
<br />
The story takes place in Kamihama - a large city that only recently has been luring witches from all over, with copies of them cropping up everywhere inexplicably (though surely intentionally). It’s explained in the first episode that Kamihama witches are, for whatever reason, stronger than normal, and more abundant. This status quo requires the girls to fight in teams—a fact that, for some, may suck the tension out of ultimately pointless fights, but for me these random scuffles serve in displaying the girls’ powers, their motivation, or some other characterizing element, all while being a constant reminder of what being a magic girl in Kamihama is like. Plus it pays to show us these details instead of leaving it to exposition. <br />
<br />
As it stands, Kamihama is a more interesting setting than Mitakihara from the old series, which was indeed little more than a city. Here, Kamihama encourages consideration of its setup: you have Mitama in the center of it all, something of a healer, a safe zone and a bounty hunting board in one, and the city is split into wards run by different magical girls living in the area. There are unspoken rules and codes of conduct when it comes to witch hunting. These all serve to make the setting dynamic and rich with character without actually showing any. However, you see this in action with an evident abundance of magical girls making background or verbal cameos from the game this is based on. They aren’t obtrusive and are brief, serving to lend weight to Kamihama as a setting more than anything. <br />
<br />
The first episode makes it clear visually just how full Kamihama is of magical girls, by displaying a spectrum of wishes plastered all over the town in what’s obviously meant to be surreal imagery and not something literal. One of which desires for the destruction of Kamihama, making me wonder if that specific wish was the cause behind everything going on, if not the reason behind these stronger witches. <br />
<br />
ANIMATION/MUSIC:<br />
<br />
As discussed in my section on characters, the animation does a good job of bringing them and the witches to life. Visually, the Labyrinths and witches that dwell within them are as surreal and symbolic as ever, offering abundant discussion that invites analysis for those as into this sort of art direction as I am. <br />
<br />
In terms of the quality, however, that’s another story. Distant characters in the background look blobby and odd, however brief some shots are, and fight choreography—save for that within the last two episodes—is quite poorly choreographed and stiff-looking. There’s not much weight to the girls’ attacks, as conceptually impressive as they are (Yachiyo can fire volleys of spears and Tsuruno’s fans emit fire—moves that look impressive but don’t have any punch). Outside of these hiccups, however, the girls and colors generally look sharp and clean, moreso than they did in the original series. <br />
<br />
SHAFT continues to confound viewers with its seemingly random imagery. Much like the abundance of chairs in the original Madoka, some of that imagery leaks into Magia Record like a stack of desks on the school rooftop made to give the scene an eerie feeling. However—again, just like in Madoka—there are times when that imagery does genuinely mean something. My favorite is when a shape-changing girl evidently made her wish to become a different person, but hates herself knowing deep down she’s still the same nasty girl. Her inner turmoil and desire is characterized by her changing into the older girls she looks up to for their personalities and likability—and later, on that same roof with the stacks of desks, we get two alone marked with cruel writings and facing one another, indicating them as belonging to this girl and her best friend, both of whom are alone but together in the face of a peer group that clearly dislikes them. <br />
<br />
The music does a great job at giving this series a Madoka feel, without just outright copying the old stuff. There’s one specific track that plays whenever the dread ramps up, and it sticks out in my mind as having the most character to it. Another track plays when an Uwasa, one of the new threats, is on display - an instrumental of a little song that&#039;s sung about it in the first episode. Music does its job otherwise, and is nothing outstanding. <br />
<br />
I like the OP better than the original. It shows off all the girls, even flashes of minor players, in shots and poses that give them character. It’s timed well with the song and is nicely colored. It changes gradually over the course of the series, specifically in deuteragonist Yachiyo’s apparent happiness, the witches and Uwasa on display in the windows, and the crowd of girls in the OP’s final shot. <br />
<br />
The ED is a beautiful song with visuals that blend animation and real-world footage. It displays Yachiyo’s buried depression and grief through imagery relating to drowning and elevator shots. There are also beautifully drawn endcards, following a still from the episode, featuring a relevant magical girl. <br />
<br />
The voice acting is superb, even the dub. Every girl puts their all into their emotions and makes you really buy what they&#039;re feeling, which goes a long way in a story this big and crowded. In both the sub and dub the voice each girl has fits them perfectly in the language they&#039;re speaking. <br />
<br />
I would actually recommend the dub for this show over sub. I feel the story sometimes shoves too much information at you while stimulating your eyes. Plus I feel a lot of the translated lines come across more naturally and clearly in the dub. I cite episode three as a fitting comparison, and the last scene of five before the ED. <br />
<br />
THEME: <br />
<br />
For me, the most important stories are the ones that have something to say. Even if the message is atypical, it’s all in how the story uses that theme and presents it in the narrative. Nothing is worse than a story about nothing, right?<br />
<br />
And Magia Record is undoubtedly a story about friendship—and while this may seem cliche for a magical girl show, the way it handles this theme reminds me fondly of what Madoka said about the genre and its application to reality in a unique, compelling way. <br />
<br />
Because virtually every character in Magia Record is not unlike the girls of the original setting: they’re deeply hurting and alone, and are doing what they can to stay true to themselves and their responsibilities while tending to that pain however they can. Magia Record takes this idea and comes up with an answer, a cure, one that’s impeded and challenged by the true antagonistic threat of the story (who isn’t formally introduced until episode #6). And yet, it’s an idea that is constantly given alternate, unhealthy answers in the forms of mysterious “Rumor Witches” called Uwasa (rumor in Japanese) - new creatures which embody urban legends, whose victims are all people who wished to believe them with all their aching hearts. A surprisingly compelling one on the thematic level is a rumor about good luck, and you just have to enslave your life to it if you want to never have a bout of bad luck, despite its inevitability - another fact of life given a healthy answer by Magia Record&#039;s &quot;point.&quot;<br />
<br />
These rumors all have to do with attaining peace and satisfaction with something that is lost, or is annoyingly present in some cases. In each of these encounters, Iroha meets new girls who, in some shape or form (either literally or philosophically), are challenged by the comfort and contentment these rumors offer. Some almost fall for their allure, many others do, while others reject them outright. And yet, instead of roiling in misery or sacrificing others for these Rumors, the girls find strength in each other and the ability to smile again by one anothers’ sides. <br />
<br />
Yes, the power of friendship is a cliche theme in this genre. However, I feel that Magia Record analyzes it well by providing a real, grounded answer to why it’s such a prevalent theme in storytelling throughout history: it gives us the strength and support needed to face the darkness of life. <br />
<br />
And for a magical girl, a victim of Kyubey, that’s what you need more than anything. <br />
<br />
<br />
STORYTELLING/PACING: <br />
<br />
If you haven’t gleaned this already (which, given my lack of derision and insults, would be understandable), this story just isn’t as good as the original Madoka’s, neither in terms of content nor quality. <br />
<br />
Conflicts happen on an episode-by-episode basis until the crew is assembled by episode 10, giving this show a monster-of-the-week feel, lack of consequences included, all of which is tethered together by the narrative throughline of Iroha searching for her lost sister. All the while a dark and enticing force is evidently building in the background, clearly the source of the weirdness the setup establishes, but isn’t entirely explained until the climax of the cour.<br />
<br />
Now there is something to be said about the emotional weight of a scene. That&#039;s a big driving force behind one&#039;s emotional investment. Sadly, because it&#039;s very clear that the girls don&#039;t know the awful truth about magical girls, the situations don&#039;t feel as terribly dire as they should. But that makes sense because of the girls&#039; attitudes in combat, save for Yachiyo who is known as the oldest magical girl and clearly hides a lot of pain. Ergo, the execution of a scene largely depends on the gravity the characters feel. <br />
<br />
For MR, however, because some of these issues driving each arc are somewhat small and inconsequential compared to the truth bombs of MM, there&#039;s disconnect between some viewers who can&#039;t bring themselves to be invested in such stakes that, in most scenarios, feel very kind compared to dying. That seems intentional to the grander narrative, however. <br />
<br />
Speaking of which, I mentioned before that SHAFT doubles down on trippy imagery this time around. What I didn&#039;t say was how well it uses these for the sake of visual storytelling, and selling an emotion with a single image. <br />
<br />
Some of these off the top of my head include:<br />
<br />
A character who lost her parents in a fire thinks of them and only sees a burnt photograph stopped at their faces. She likely carries it around, which is unusually sentimental of her. Her character ties to the luck rumor, who almost falls for the convenient chance to fulfill her deepest wish, but realizes family is more precious to her as she thoughtlessly saves her new friend - the only person since her parents to show her any kindness and patience. <br />
A character who hates herself and how she treats her friend seems to imagine message boards and group chats talking about or at least alluding to her. This is later used to voice her honest feelings in brief flashes, seeming to indicate that these images are an allusion to the idea that everyone talks about her behind her back and how she wishes she can be fearless when talking to her only friend, and perhaps has gotten close through texting but chickened out. We see these thoughts written in notebooks meaning this character dwells on these regrets a lot. It&#039;s a sad and realistic image given how horribly interconnected teenagers are now. <br />
Half of Iroha&#039;s bedroom is bare, even in the oddest places. It feels wrong and sad, selling me on the feeling Iroha does when she thinks about her sister&#039;s erased existence. <br />
<br />
You get the picture. <br />
<br />
While I can sit here and say it’s your fault if you aren’t grabbed by this premise or visually rich storytelling, I can also fairly fault the anime for not doing as good a job as it could’ve. I don’t quite mean cutting characters for time, because it’s clear that everyone will be involved in a meaningful way in the future. Rather, I mean that the story itself does more to confuse viewers than engage them. And instead of it being in an ingenious way that invokes speculation, it’s more done in a “oh, you thought these characters were important? Well here’s a random-feeling sideshow involving three more and a new mystery!” That’s sort of how all of the sideshows feel until the crew is assembled, and you take a step back to consider themes, at least for me. <br />
<br />
However, I don’t think this is as bad as some make it out to be. And that, of course, falls into what you consider important when engaging yourself with a story. <br />
<br />
It should go without saying that this isn’t an anime you can just shut your brain off while watching and expect greatness to fall into your lap. Heck, while Madoka told a genuinely compelling and masterfully crafted narrative by comparison, its depths weren’t evident in every crevice of its writing until you went back with a fine-toothed comb. <br />
<br />
That comb is what naysayers, I feel, are disregarding with Magia Record—and let’s be honest here, it’s probably because the lack of Gen the Butcher must mean it has zero possibility of depth. <br />
<br />
And yet, if you read up to this point, read what I had to say about the symbolism and imagery and character writing, you’ll know that this is one of those stories that asks YOU to put the work into appreciating its depths. It asks that you have your finger on the rewind button, because believe me, some important character information like wishes and emotions are given in flashes of the environment, sometimes with text piled on the subtitles (again, plugging in for the dub). It’s impossible to catch everything on a single, vaguely-interested viewing. <br />
<br />
Can this be considered bad to some? Of course. But not every show is for everybody, and personally, I like a story that trusts me to use my brain instead of me expecting it to explain everything. Better yet, much like the OG series, Magia Record benefits greatly from a rewatch. <br />
<br />
By the end of the thirteenth episode of the first cour, you have a more complete view on the girls that going back, perceiving their actions and behaviors with new information, offers a different story and emotion than they did on a first watch. That kind of rewatchability is one I can appreciate a great deal. It really is the fuel that keeps a finished show alive in discussion boards. <br />
<br />
OVERVIEW: <br />
<br />
Magia Record is not a perfect anime. It is, compared to Madoka Magica, sadly disappointing. This is reflected unfairly, but understandably, in the MAL score. <br />
<br />
However, I feel that if one can remove their nostalgia goggles and allow themselves to become enwrapped in this story and its characters, you might find yourself pleasantly surprised. For all its faults, Magia Record tells a trippy and at times heart-tugging story about sad, broken girls trying to find hope in a world without Madokami. It does so through a combination of direction, dialogue, character and creature design. <br />
<br />
When I score an anime and add it to my list, I consider the number I’m giving it and compare it to others. I ask myself, “would I recommend this as much as I do these shows?” I also compare it to those in a score above and below my considered number. <br />
<br />
I was dancing between a 7 and an 8 for a long time. When I consider what makes a 7, and an 8, however, and heeding my personal system of comparison, I came to realize what my honest feelings are. <br />
<br />
If I were to give Magia Record a 7, that would be putting it on the same personal level as Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU season 1, Angel Beats, MHA season 1, Death Note, Love Live!, and Jojo parts 3 and 4 to name a few. These are all solid series I would recommend to anyone the genre appeals to, but did not give an 8 because I felt there were too many little flaws culminating in a lumpy whole, or just an idea that wasn’t executed as well as I felt it could have, either in being bogged down by half-baked ideas or simply not being anything profoundly special. <br />
<br />
You can see why Magia Record may fit here, I hope. <br />
<br />
And yet, then I considered what makes an 8 for me and why I’ve given what I have such a strong score. For me, an 8 is basically “a 7 but better.” No shit, but looking at my list I, personally, can pick out specifics that separate entries in these two scores. And for me, an 8/10 is a show that is at the very least considered “good” in every aspect. But it does more than that—in more than one of these aspects, I found myself deeply invested in them and craving to see more of them, whether that’s in theme or dialogue. <br />
<br />
These reasons are why I gave Aggretsuko’s depressingly grounded characters and setting an 8/10, or Shield Hero’s characters and themes of trust and forgiveness, or Parasyte’s philosophy and endearing main protagonists, or Yuki Yuna is a Hero’s theme on sacrifice, its worldbuilding, voice acting, and lovable characters. <br />
<br />
Even if a show as a whole didn’t have anything meaningful to say, I can identify a quality package within the confines of its genre and see why I find it to be so well-made: like in Dragon Maid and K-On! Season 1, which is undoubtedly some of the best of the Slice of Life genre for a great many, greatly strong reasons. <br />
<br />
For similar reasons, I couldn’t help but give Magia Record an 8/10. I’ll be honest, its pacing issues almost gave it a 7, and I’m sure many judge it for that a lot more harshly. And yet, the more I consider the way it handles its characters and theme, the less I look down on that issue and more see it as an unfortunate necessity for the kind of story it wants to tell. <br />
<br />
Because Magia Record, for all its faults, tells a subtly poignant story about friendship and processing grief, in a unique and naturally compelling setting rife with interesting and endearing characters, all of whom interact on an episode-by-episode basis with symbolic imagery intent on driving these ideas home. <br />
<br />
Don’t just give this a watch. Give it your time and patience, give it your heart and you’ll find yourself in the midst of a tale that, I feel, has something it wants to say. <br />
<br />
Even if it takes 13 episodes to blatantly get there. <br />

    As a spin-off series and game adaptation, Magia Record had so much weight on its shoulders from the popularity and appraisal of the original parent story of Madoka Magica, and unfortunately it could neither do anything to carry through that pressure nor be a good enough anime series in general.<br />
<br />
I consider myself a fan of Studio SHAFT and the original Madoka Magica show, so when the adaptation of what was apparently a spinoff app game of the aforementioned series, I was really looking forward to having that sense of nostalgia. I even kept my expectations in check knowing that the new upcoming spin-off was never

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333262">
        gonna be anything close to the original, and at the very least it could try to be its own thing, its own identity. But unfortunately that did not turn out to be the case.<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
To start off, I want to really note how odd and weakly constructed the story format is. The show starts off with our main character Iroha Tamaki apparently searching for her little sister, which by itself sparks enough interest to follow. From that point on, the plot goes on rather fluctuated pacing, swinging from fast to slow at random without much discern between the minor and major details of the plot, barely making enough, if any, effort to even explore them.<br />
The format, at least to me, feels more like a series of rinse-and-repeat drills with every few episodes where we’re given our “Uwasa of the Week” and/or introduced to new characters. In a mystery series or any sort of episodic story format, this would work out fine...except it isn’t any of such. Instead, the script for the most part felt more like a CGDCGT (“cute girls doing cute girl things”) type. The primary protagonist, Iroha, meets up with secondary protagonist, which is Yachiyo Nanami in this case, and go out to find and investigate the mysteries of the Uwasa and Kamihama City, and accompany and befriend other fellow magical girls along the way. In a world that was thematically constructed for the intent of a darker ambiance, this just doesn’t feel right. <br />
Heavy dramatic scenes ensue, the girls find and fight the Uwasa, the chances of sacrifice and high stakes are all but skipped to allegedly establish an underlying darker conflict involving the main antagonistic group. It’s more like watching the magical girls basically undertaking boss raids and stuff. The drama is then resolved, the girls are seemingly okay and safe, the atmosphere is light-hearted and there’s no proper connection or siegeway to the next segment of conflict. There’s nothing to close to enough to really connect or put together deeper themes like selfless desires, endless suffering, etc.<br />
Not only does this cycle quickly grow redundant and predictable, it hinders and ruins the intended darker tonal consistency of this Madoka Magica universe. The story also seems to have issues trying to handle and develop an annoying surplus of characters, and as a result, nearly all of them are merely shallow archetypal gimmicks...I’m not even sure they’re qualified to be even called actual characters.<br />
The worldbuilding and exposition is rather disjointed. One would obviously need to have watched the original series prior to checking out this show, and I dunno what person with common sense would do otherwise. Even with the knowledge from the original series, though, trekking through many of the introduced plot elements here isn’t exactly intriguing, just excruciatingly confusing and baffling in a bad way. New information is mentioned but never explored or explained. The show tries to forcefully hide the clues instead of being subtle with the gradual answers and revelations in an effort to look smart. As a result, visual cues feel vague and don’t answer enough, thus coming off as annoying or even pretentious. It’s like trying to add chocolate sprinkles to a slice of stale storebrand bread instead of a whole gorgeous-looking birthday cake. Remember, extra stuff to a story like visual cues and symbolism are supposed to be nice accessories or toppings, not hindering liabilities or unnecessary flavors. Doesn’t it really suck to know that one would have to check out the wiki databases for the game source material just to get the answers and/or other important details that the anime decided to gloss over? That’s honestly not a good sign for most game adaptations, especially that of a spin-off game.<br />
The mystery element at its core would seem rather promising if it actually had more focus on solving or investigating as opposed to having to take character detours. Even when the explanations do come, it’s too obvious and something we should already know right from the start. Nothing really feels dangerous or with high stakes up until the very end, and even then, it doesn’t feel like anything particularly serious whatsoever. This is where we really miss the likes of Gen Urobutchi, the mad lad responsible for the tragic, twisted, and merciless themes of not only the OG Madoka Magica, but the likes of Psycho Pass and Fate/Zero as well.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS:<br />
Due to the frail structure of the story, the characters become arguably the weakest point in the series. Not only are they’re practically one-dimensional (two-dimensional) with barely any much depth or context with them to make us care...there’s just too many of them. I’d rather not divulge into each and every one of them, in all honesty.<br />
The OG Madoka Magica actually worked due to having a small set of characters, giving the show more time to explore their respective backgrounds and personalities as well as the visual ques associated with them. As a result, they’re actually a multi-layered cast, despite what many people might believe otherwise. With the case of Magia Record, that is completely not the case. I should at least bring up the two primary protagonists here.<br />
Iroha Tamaki doesn’t have much going for her in terms of background despite the whole thing about finding her younger sister. She’s supposed to play the “neutral control”, the innocent selfless main character, but her views constantly fluctuate throughout the series, and not in a progressive manner to be called character development.<br />
Yachiyo Nanami is supposed to be this Homura-like aloof persona trying to stop something dangerous from happening to the world. Time and time again, the plot was given the chance to properly give us insight into her ambitions and motives, and her possible ties with the antagonistic figures. But when it does, it seems to keep stopping halfway with the exposition, yet it keeps trying to keep Yachiyo relevant somehow while putting her to the side a bit too often. I mean, they keep showing her a lot in the ending visuals.<br />
All the other characters barely have much going for them besides their generic personalities as side characters. All these characters showing off their single-handed gimmicks is basically the show pulling countless shameless plugs of promoting the gacha games. Flashbacks are presented in order to provide answers but the heavy reliance of merely “answering” with vague hints only end up clogging the script instead of giving the cast more structure. As mentioned before, it ends up as nothing but a whole bunch of uninspiring “characters”.<br />
<br />
AUDIOVISUALS:<br />
The animation and sounds are the lone bright spots in the show in the most parts, but they’re pretty much taken for granted by now. Instead of the weird and curious-looking buildings and backgrounds from the OG’s setting of Mitakihara City, we are given actual realistic-looking buildings, roads, and landmarks. That’s pretty neat and all, except it doesn’t do anything to add to any sort of theme and identity (assuming the show actually had a definite one). The magical girl transformations from episode 3 were nothing but “sakuga”, they looked pretty, dazzling, everything synonymous of beauty and charm. Yes, it’s cool and all. But it&#039;s merely one collective scene out of the entirety. The voice acting is just fine as well as the overall soundtracks, but they’re nothing particularly impressive. There’s not enough from the audiovisuals to make it really stand out in particular compared to other shows that display similar amounts of audiovisual quality. I know I might be holding too high standards considering the accomplishments of the original story too much, but it’s something I can’t really ignore.<br />
<br />
PERSONAL ENJOYMENT:<br />
I wanted to like this show merely for its association with the original parent story. I needed something from the franchise to kill my impatience of waiting for a possible sequel to the Rebellion movie. I desired for something that badly at the time. Maybe I should’ve been more patient, though.<br />
<br />
The first episode did positive things like play some nostaglic tracks from the original show as well as go through a monologue breaking down the core elements of the Madoka Magica world. After that, everything just collectively degrade in terms of script and character progression. I found myself perplexed, impatient, and confused after each episode, just waiting for that one nasty twist or untimely death to turn the show on its head. And the show had its chances, but failed to partake in going the “Urobutcher” direction, and thus I finish an episode asking questions, contemplating what could’ve happened instead, and having to, annoyingly enough, look up stuff or ask the more knowledgeable fanbases of the game about what was missing or what was hidden from me deliberately. It grew to be a pain in the ass. Did I really have to go through all this trouble just to get any answers, as opposed to letting the show present it by itself? What the actual hell. I’m supposed to be enjoying my SHAFT trip, not come out of every episode rubbing my forehead in frustration. I feel genuinely betrayed. It also makes me wonder...wouldn’t this be a bit better off if it was actually given more than just 13 episodes to work with and properly pace and explain everything? I’m at a loss for words here.<br />
<br />
OVERALL:<br />
Simply put, Magia Record tried to ride off the popularity and settings of the original Madoka Magica, but it failed to recreate the tonal consistency of the latter as well as being unable to establish its own identity, having instead to rely on game source material and basically milk the franchise. Even if you’re a Madoka Magica fan like me, this is an associated series that I honestly can’t recommend to you. You’re better off rewatching the original instead of partaking in what has been a practically disappointing husk of a spin-off. Since when did spin-off series ever have high success rates, anyway, though?<br />
Or better yet, go watch (or rewatch) 3-Gatsu No Lion or the Monogatari series instead. It&#039;ll save you more time.<br />
Granted, there IS an upcoming season 2 that can possibly redeem the prequel&#039;s untidy results, but the damage here has already been committed. You&#039;ve disappointed me here, SHAFT. I&#039;m truly taken aback.

    I wanna start off this review by saying I&#039;m not sure why some find this to be either boring, or not interesting??? Like I really don&#039;t get it.  <br />
<br />
I find this completely interesting, and I love the themes within it. It keeps me interested on a week by week basis. Instead of starting all cute and calm like how Madoka was, this comes off strong for me right from the get go. Which sets up the show nicely in my book. It really makes you think with everything they&#039;ve set up so far. I also adore the main girl, her story is not only

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327440">
        a mystery, but also I really feel for her too.<br />
<br />
The art style as what you&#039;d expect for this show, which is grand in it&#039;s own right. As Madoka themed magical girl shows have always looked great in my view, and the creativity shown in some of the scenes from just backgrounds, to the train, to the witch fights in general. Really well done. <br />
<br />
The music also adds to the tone of the show, which is also well done. Nothing better than the right kind of music to set scenes.<br />
<br />
If you love Madoka, you&#039;ll love this. So give it a go!

    This review of Magia Record contains spoilers to both Magia Record and some plot points of the original Madoka Magica!! For anyone who has not seen Magia Record, there will be a spoiler free TLDR at the end of this review.<br />
<br />
Let me preface this review with a disclaimer as well. I will be comparing and contrasting some aspects of Magia Record with the original Madoka Magica, which I know is a point of contention among some viewers (though I will not compare it to Rebellion, because I feel it’s unfair to compare a TV anime with an anime movie because of the scheduling constraints TV

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333671">
        anime usually have). While this is NOT a comparative essay, I believe it&#039;s fair to compare the two to a certain extent, as they take place in the same universe and because you would have to have seen Madoka Magica to fully understand its spin-off. You can’t judge Magia Record on its own merits, simply because to understand its world, you would have had to have seen the original. To expect people to judge these two anime like they are separate entities is quite frivolous, in my opinion. Anyway, on with the review!<br />
<br />
I think like most people who ended up watching Magia Record, I’m a big fan of the original anime and, if not more so, the Rebellion movie. While I didn’t necessarily expect much from a spin-off based off a mobile gatcha game, I can’t deny that I DID expect a lot more out of this anime than I maybe should have, primarily due to the fact that the franchise is such a huge and well-respected intellectual property within the anime community and due to the fact that animated installments of the franchise are far and few between. With how talented the staff over at Shaft is, I at least expected Magia Record to just be a dumb fun experience, if anything. But then I saw how little of the original staff had worked on this spin-off and I started to worry a little. My main concern was with how Gen Urobuchi and Akiyuki Shinbou (and to an extent, Yuki Kajiura) were barely involved with Magia Record and how the responsibilities of directing and series composition was instead given to the quite inexperienced Inu Curry, who originally only concerned themselves with things such as background art, character design, etc. From how this anime turned out, I suppose my concerns were justified, at least for me. <br />
<br />
Firstly, I’d like to discuss some of the things I did like about Magia Record and some things I believe it deserves some genuine praise for. Starting off with the animation. While it had flaws, which I will elaborate on later in this review, the animation of Magia Record was usually very consistent, even more so than the blu-ray version of the original. There were no weird faces or off-model proportions as far as I noticed and, generally, the presentation of this anime was very stylish and sleek. I would especially like to praise the scenes that introduce the individual uwasa. Very reminiscent of the pop-up book art style of the witches, these scenes are interesting and great alternatives to characters simply exposition dumping to Iroha about what they’re going to fight next. The way the Endless Solitude uwasa was introduced in episode nine is a great example of this. Besides that, Magia Record occasionally had its subtleties. Things such as in episode ten, where Mami recalled “the girls I guided”, these girls being Madoka and Sayaka, Madoka’s face was obscured as a somewhat subtle reference to the fact that in the timeline of the original, Madoka doesn’t exist anymore. Or how Iroha owned a plush that seemed to be modeled to look like the witch called Candy, who appeared in episode four. Magia Record had quite a few scenes and references like these and occasionally alluded to the original and to the gatcha game it was based off. Though this clearly doesn’t affect the anime narratively very much, I still appreciate it rewarding attentive viewers for paying attention to the direction and presentation. Anyway, that is about it for the positives, now onto some of my grievances.<br />
<br />
A common complaint targeted at Magia Record is that the cast feels bloated and I can’t help but agree. Because of its source material as a gatcha game, where the whole point is to have a large cast of characters to collect, it’s only natural this problem would arise. The first arc revolving around Rena and Kaede (and arguably Momoko, though she’s more involved by proxy rather than actually having something to do with the conflict) was especially emblematic of this. After the first episode introduced the main character, Iroha, a throw-away side character called Kuroe, and Yachiyo, whose introduction felt quite awkward and forced, three separate characters were introduced at the same time, these being Rena, Kaede and Momoko. Now, I have no problem with them quickly setting up and introducing side characters to use later on in the anime, similarly to Hitomi in the original Madoka Magica whose involvement in the story had actual impact later on Sayaka’s character arc, I find that these characters are issued in way too quickly and leave very little narrative impact. Instead of being given the time to develop and to care about these character, as a viewer, I didn’t find myself becoming invested in them or their conflicts. This is exacerbated by the extremely fast pacing in the first few episodes of the anime and even after the story slows down after the first arc, the pacing still remains an issue during the entirety of the runtime with how inconsistent it is. In the case of Rena and Kaede specifically, when I watched them fight about eight minutes later into the same episode they were introduced, I couldn’t help but feel like it was melodramatic and forced. But due to its cast size (I assume), Magia Record doesn’t have enough time for the viewer to become really invested and even if it could, its script isn’t nearly as charming or interesting enough to really carry its relatively tight episode to character ratio. None of the characters had an impact on me, even characters that were more developed such as Yachiyo or characters that the audience got to spend a lot of time with such as Iroha. Never mind that, to me, both of these characters ended up feeling like hollow shells of Homura (Yachiyo being Homura, of course) and Madoka. In the end, I found Sana to be the only remotely memorable character in this anime and that was due to the fact that she had clear motives, an interesting story and the anime took its time to introduce her to the audience by showing her back story and her relationship to her family and to Ai. Even then, all of these characters felt rather shallow and it didn&#039;t help that Magia Record didn’t seem to have a message or clear themes like the original Madoka or the Rebellion movie. Magia Record didn’t elaborate on the original themes, didn’t even seem to touch the same themes of hope, despair, selfishness, selflessness, martyrdom, etc and didn&#039;t have any themes that could have been specific to its story. Magia Record ended up adding very frivolous details to the canon of the universe, but generally felt like it had no other reason to exist other than to capitalize on the success of the original. Yes, I acknowledge this anime was based off a mobile game that was probably made purely to make money, however, this doesn’t mean that I’m just going to let Magia Record off the hook. From the little I have played of the game, the anime didn’t follow the exact same story and many things were tweaked, presumably to fix some of the more awkward and convoluted scenes that pad out the games story mode, so I feel like with someone experienced or simply very competent in series composition and/or script writing, I feel like these issues could have been avoided. Magia Record is clearly not restricted in trying to be a faithful adaptation.<br />
<br />
Going back to Rena and Kaede’s “arc” in the first few episodes, another issue I have with Magia Record presents itself; its needless tendency to spell things out for the audience, instead of letting them figure things out for themselves. At the end of episode two, Kaede apologized to Rena and asked her to be friends again and, like the audience was told would happen, the uwasa of the Friendship Ending Staircase showed up. Its familiars then proceeded to basically spell out what Rena was thinking in the most cheesy, heavy-handed way possible, with the familiars talking in human voices instead of the creepy, modulated ones that were used to introduce the individual uwasa (which I feel cheapens their horrifying and incongruous nature by having them sounding so familiar and human). Never mind that this scene felt very melodramatic and awkward, I find it quite agitating that Magia Record even felt the need to tell the audience what Rena was very clearly thinking or at least what she was thinking when she wrote her and Kaede’s names on the staircase. The simple fact that an uwasa showed up after Kaede apologized should be enough for the audience to draw their own conclusions, mainly that either of the two had written both of their names on the stairs (though I actually would have loved it if Kaede was the one who did it, as a sort of twist). This is just one example of the anime telling the audience things they should already have picked up. Another particularly frustrating example is in the last episode, where Yachiyo called Iroha by her first name for the first time, which I actually thought was a really nice moment……… until Iroha literally said, “this is the first time you called me by my first name”. This honestly completely ruined the moment for me. Being told something which, as a somewhat attentive audience member, you should have picked up on is inane and feels like you’re being talked down to. It feels as if the script writer had no faith in their audience to simply pick up on this fact. Another example that is somewhat similar is in episode twelve, when the main cast get explained in a literal lecture how soul gems work and how witches are born, which the audience should already know and thus ends up doing very little but waste the already relatively short runtime of Magia Record. While it helped setting up Yachiyo’s back story in a more interesting way than simply having her tell Iroha (or any other character who didn’t know), again, it’s a waste spending so much time telling the audience things they should clearly know already.<br />
<br />
Another big issue in Magia Record is something I mentioned before; the pacing. Like I already said, the pacing is extremely fast in the first three or so episode, but the witch fights in Magia Record are an especially bad example of this and suffer from this issue a lot. Despite the fact that the witches of Kamihama were said to be much stronger than the ones in Mitakihara, fights against witches took very little time and seemingly very little effort. Witches such as Rebecca, Candy and Gertrud were dealt with extremely quickly and end up adding very little to the overall plot or story, often even detracting from it. Zenobia was the only witch who was more difficult to deal with, but that was mainly because Iroha was a weak magical girl and Yachiyo made quick work of her when she stepped in. Candy was one of the most egregious examples of witches simply being there to pad out episodes. She added literally nothing to the episode, was completely unrelated to the plot, detracted from that episodes story and was dealt with in one hit by Tsuruno. The witches of Kamihama simply don’t live up to what the audience is told about them and that’s really sad, considering the witches were such a huge selling point of the original. Their unique art style and alien designs/cries made them such intimidating creatures. Though even some witches were dealt with rather quickly in the original, such as Roberta, there was a genuine possibility of character death in the original after episode three, which made the witches much more threatening. Never mind that there were much more difficult fights, such as with Elsa Maria and Oktavia, which then reaffirmed the genuine threats witches were. To make an example, in episode four of the original, when Madoka escaped from the people who were brainwashed by the witch Elly, she ended up being trapped in a room with the witch and was forced into her labyrinth. Her genuine screams of terror and desperate pleas for help (props to her voice actress) while being faced with a monster similar to the one who killed her friend and the person she looked up to the most right in front her eyes felt so chilling. Like I said, the death of Mami in episode three really established witches as a threat, but scenes like the one in episode four just reaffirmed that. Anyway, to summarize this point a little bit, I’m just disappointed the witches were so underutilized in Magia Record and I feel as if they should have just put their focus into the uwase, considering they’re the main intrigue (I really didn&#039;t find myself caring or being interesting in Ui as a plot hook) and new concept introduced in this anime.<br />
<br />
And last but certainly not least; the animation. While consistently on model in non-action scenes, Magia Record had extremely few interesting fight scenes. Due to its limited and rushed schedule, the original Madoka Magica had its moments of very inconsistent animation, mainly during dialogue driven scenes, where some characters had weirdly drawn faces or proportions. However, it also had extremely beautifully animated scenes such as the cut of Mami mowing down Charlotte’s familiars with her shotguns in episode three or pretty much the entire fight against Elly in episode four. Clearly for me and for a lot of other fans of Madoka Magica, its spectacular fight scenes were part of the anime’s appeal, together with its unique witch art style. Magia Record on the other hand, has literally one fight scene that barely even comes close in quality, that being the cut from the last episode where Sayaka blocks a Tiro Finale from Mami (which I will admit, was a beautifully animated sequence and just really damn cool). Instead, its fights often looked stilted and quite unimpressive from an animation stand point. The animation quality didn’t improve during fight scenes to really make an impact on the viewer. If anything, the quality tended to drop during these kind of scenes and seemed to heavily rely on Inu Curry’s unique art style to carry it (and relying on there being a lot of things on the screen). So, besides having less intrigue narratively, I feel like visually Magia Record was also a step down and unfortunately musically as well. While I absolutely didn’t expect a relatively new composer such as Takumi Ozawa to create an original soundtrack even remotely as iconic as the original (or the Rebellion movie) composed by Yuki Kajiura, I’m still quite disappointed by the downgrade that this OST turned out to be. Very few tracks really spoke to me and quite a few tracks from the original soundtrack were reused, especially in the first few episodes, but otherwise it’s not even really worth discussing. The voice acting is similarly not worth discussing in my opinion. The voice actresses did a solid job, but nothing really outstanding. The only thing I will say on this matter is that I’m sad they wasted Kana Hanazawa’s voice acting skills on a throw-away character.<br />
<br />
Now I understand that this is the first season, so questions like “how do Doppels work?”, “how do they interact with the stopping of entropy?” and “where is Kyubey in all of this?” are most likely going to be answered in the second season. I’m actually glad that there will be more episodes, because I hope this will counteract(?) the extremely fast pacing a lot of people, such as myself, had issues with, but I doubt it will make up for the whiplash from the first season. I think I will watch it when it comes out, mainly to review it and hope it becomes better, but frankly, my hopes aren’t very high.<br />
<br />
To give a quick and spoiler free summary of my review:<br />
<br />
TLDR; While some of the animation is quite consistent, the visual presentation can be intriguing from time to time and it rewards attentive viewers (which I always love to see in any visual medium), Magia Record has quite a lot of issues. The cast is bloated with characters and none of them particularly stand out or are very memorable in the end, even when NOT compared to the stellar main cast of the original. The inconsistent and often break-neck pacing exacerbates this issue a lot and the lack of impressive fight scenes (or impressive animation in general) makes Magia Record even a bad “turn off your brain” show. I would seriously advise not wasting your time on this anime, but if you’re still interested even after reading this, don’t let me stop you from doing so. Play the mobile game instead?

    -Note: English is not my native language, I apologize for possible mistakes. (This review does not contain spoilers)<br />
<br />
This was one of the most anticipated releases this year, the love I have for Madoka is enormous, so my expectation for this spin-off was perhaps too exaggerated for something that ultimately turned out to be nothing more than a long commercial or advertising for the game with the same name.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll start with the good things of Magia Record. As always, SHAFT studio work is just from another planet, beautiful shots and scenes, continuously well-kept visual work, along with beautiful OST at all times, characters have nice design,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333253">
        series felt really refreshing at first, as a way to expand the world of magical girls and present a different story.<br />
<br />
However, that&#039;s the best I can say about the show, I&#039;m not going to lie the first episode catches you completely, SHAFT knew how to sell quickly with its first episode, but the series was declining rapidly until presenting a very badly developed plot, presenting a lot of drama, but without any suspense. The narrative is very slow to the point of quickly becoming tedious, the series abuses to present characters at all times, which turn out to be mostly generic characters and with which you don&#039;t end up sympathizing or when you start to know them, they are left aside to present another new character while you still try to process who these people are. That&#039;s right, the series did not end its presentation, the plot did not feel like it was moving forward in any moment and never did it feel like something important happened, new mysteries appeared chapter after chapter, apart from references or easter eggs that would only capture the attention of people who know the game.<br />
<br />
The series stagnated and ended up drinking from nostalgia, being that its best moments were the participation and small cameos of the protagonists of the original series, but that the series does not take off and that presents a slow rhythm is enough to bore your audience. Having potential to explore with its characters, the series chose to continue presenting more and more magical girls as if it were a Battle Royal, decided to move away from the original mystery and continued to introduce new subplots and characters that ended up feeling like a mostly boring filler.<br />
<br />
The plot ends up being unattractive, confusing and where nothing happens that makes it interesting.<br />
<br />
Anyone reading this poorly written review at the moment would think that I&#039;m only a fan of Madoka Magica who detest this spin-off for being different from the original, and it&#039;s that Madoka Magica and Magia Record are incredibly different despite being from the same universe, while Madoka played deeper themes and followed a main thread, Magia Record is a more peaceful anime, more of the day to day that tries to show the ties and friendship between the characters despite their past, but sadly ends up doing it in a dry way.<br />
For start, the story is not written by Gen Urobuchi, even the composition of the music is composed by another group, with that and the show is based on a game it was obvious to expect something very different, I&#039;m not surprised to find a fans who enjoyed this series despite all the mistakes, even if they do not know anything about the game, for my part I&#039;ll learn to no longer feel great expectations for any adaptation that comes from a game.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, apart from the OST, the art and the characters with “pretty” designs, there is nothing that stands out from this series, hopefully with the 2nd Season confirmed, it can improve as a whole, for now it&#039;s just another show &quot;magical girls that fight&quot;, while they play house.<br />

    FOURTH EPISODE IN. <br />
<br />
The art is amazing. Coming from playing the game, seeing the witches animated is such a satsifying and terrifying experience. <br />
<br />
Yachiyo is looking great. Hot damn, that White pants and blouse combo has me sweating.<br />
<br />
I appreciate that they adapted the story to make it fit the animated format. So far all the changes have been really good and keep the tone of the story as it was originally. I think they have actually managed to make it even more surreal and creepy. <br />
<br />
I dont reccomend watching this as your intro to Madoka Magica. <br />
<br />
Sound is good. A lot of it sounds like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327734">
        it has been taken from Madoka Magica which makes sense and its good, BUT I was hoping to hear more of the original game music appear to set the series apart and stand on its own.  Maybe theyre saving it for later. <br />
<br />
<br />
All in all though, its very enjoyable. Theres a lot of talent and clear hard work going into this and its heartwarming to see. <br />

    To begin this review, I&#039;d like to say that I&#039;ve seen the entire original Madoka Magica TV series and all three movies and am also a player of the Magia Record game, although I play the EN version and am not caught up on whatever events have transpired in the JP version.<br />
<br />
For this review, I am focusing mainly on the anime (and not the game), but I may comment on some choices the anime makes in adopting certain aspects of the game. This review contains a few spoilers, but nothing too major. Take caution in reading it though.<br />
<br />
STORY: 6<br />
Magia Record doesn&#039;t come close to the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327495">
        original Madoka Magica when it comes to story. The protagonist, Iroha Tamaki&#039;s entire goal is to look for her sister in Kamihana City. This premise, alone, seems interesting, but that the anime executes this is jarring and offputting.<br />
<br />
In Episode 1, Iroha Tamaki has a friend who tells her about a dream. Her friend tells her that &quot;magical girls can be saved in Kamihana City.&quot; However, after episode 1, that friend just disappears and we never see her again. She&#039;s an anime addition to the cast of characters and wasn&#039;t present in the Magia Record game. I imagine that she was added to introduce the audience into this world and give Iroha a reason to travel to Kamihana City. Hopefully, they will bring her back at one point or another, but her presence and then absence from the first episode to the next few leaves the question of why Magic Girls outside Kamihana City are having the dream unanswered.<br />
<br />
This is just one example of the anime feeling disjointed. From episodes 2-4, scenes cut from Iroha thinking about her sister to Iroha walking or just Iroha having conversations with Magic Girls. There are interesting things going on in the background (for example, advertisements switch on and off as Kaede and Reina converse over lunch), but they don&#039;t make up for the lack of connection between the scenes. If the directors were going for a feel or fluidity, perhaps Iroha wandering throughout Kamihana City not knowing what&#039;s going on, they didn&#039;t do it right.<br />
<br />
ART: 9<br />
The art is GORGEOUS and Shaft is back at it again with their eye candy. I appreciate all the attention to background detail (in episode 4, as the girls talk, each one is eating their snack in a different way). The witch labyrinths are eerie as usual, but they don&#039;t quite reach the power of the original ones (though I may just be used to them since they&#039;re based on the game labyrinths). The only reason why I bumped the art down to a 9 was that there were blatant CGI creatures in episode 1 that did not look right in the setting.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 7<br />
The music itself is beautiful; however, the usage of it is not. In episode 1, so many different songs kept playing in the background for no apparent reason except to have PMMM fans reminisce about where they have heard those lovely tunes before.<br />
<br />
I also personally am disappointed in the fact that (MINOR SPOILERS) the voice of the creatures that say &quot;have you heard? have you heard?&quot; is that of a normal human being instead of the disjointed sounds that the game has. It was just more powerful in the game.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 6<br />
The characters are not completely copied and pasted from the original cast as some people say, but there are many similarities. Iroha has somewhat low self-esteem like Madoka. However, their family dynamics are completely different as Madoka has a loving and supportive family that is always there for her whereas Iroha&#039;s family takes off on a trip and leaves her all by herself. Iroha is also much lonelier than Madoka. Aside from the one magic girl friend (that mysteriously isn&#039;t seen again after episode 1), she doesn&#039;t have any friends and her loneliness was portrayed quite well in episode 1 through her being taken advantage of by her classmates that had friends.<br />
<br />
Yachiyo seems like a Homura--quiet, protective--which, in a way she is. However, Yachiyo pushes away her friends when Homura tries to keep them (or rather, Madoka) as a part of her life.<br />
<br />
In essence, though the personalities of the characters are similar to the original, they are not carbon copies and their actions are drastically different.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 7<br />
I love the art style and music. The first and second episode (aside from the addition of the random friend) was wonderful, though it started to fall off by the third. The fight scene in the third episode was especially disappointing. I hope it was because they saved their budget for the later fights. I, as a player of the game, clearly have some bias when coming to this anime. I&#039;m disappointed because they kept much of the dialogue and it feels like the anime is the game come to life without the extra fighting of familiars in-between plot points. The fourth episode felt rushed and disjointed because the girls just walk around and talk all day and the only loss/conflict that they had was that Yachiyo couldn&#039;t get the items that were on sale.<br />
<br />
But, since it&#039;s following the game plot pretty well, I&#039;ll be watching until the end. The themes really interest me (&quot;Magic girls can be saved in Kamihana City!&quot;), though I won&#039;t say too much in case of spoilers.<br />
<br />
<br />
TLDR; The story and it&#039;s themes are interesting and the art is beautiful, but the way it is directed takes away from the enjoyment. However, as a fan of the Magia Record game and the original Madoka Magica, I will still watch it till the end.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re a fan of the game, I would give it a watch. If you&#039;re looking for some more philosophical questioning of magic girls and why they should suffer such a fate, this might be for you. If you want more of the beautiful art style, this is also a good watch! However, if you&#039;re desperate for edgier, sob stories that end in tragedy, I&#039;m sorry to break it to you but Magia Record seems to be a lot less angsty than the original TV series. But I think that sometimes, a little light-heartedness is ok.<br />
<br />
P.S. (SPOILER FOR MADOKA MAGICA) For those of you wondering, Magia Record takes place in one of Homura&#039;s alternate timelines before the timeline that took place in the Madoka Magica series

    2011: I want to be a magical girl to help others!<br />
<br />
2020: I want to be a magical girl to save my dear sister who basically doesn&#039;t provide empathy for the viewer to care.<br />
<br />
In fact I recognize all the merit that Madoka has for his original production, ideas and characters, even though some are plot devices, but he was still daring and ventured in his narrative to surprise, it is something that few shows that want to work on a dark theme of a genre can do it. I admit I don&#039;t like Urobuchi&#039;s writing, but I still recognized his potential in Madoka&#039;s first anime in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review329029">
        2011, he really influenced a lot in this culture of the dark mahou shoujo genre that he often has, a genre that I personally consider disposable as a dark isekai.<br />
<br />
Now I ask everyone, what is the reason for this anime to exist? Maybe you will answer that it may be a new beginning for Shaft in its new phase, but I say that this is not relevant, because they could easily start another series of Monogatari that the profit would be greater, or start adapting Zaregoto again, which is quite popular, the question remains without a definitive answer. If this is an intention to bring more people to this gacha, I say with all the strength that this anime has failed miserably, and manages to insult the entire universe already completed in a franchise.<br />
<br />
Magia Record wants to tell a story about someone who lost her sister, and then she wants to tell a story about two lesbians fighting among themselves, then she wants to return to her theme of losing loved ones and now she wants to tell a story about a random character and your conflict with witches, can you see how messed up this story is with so many characters introduced? It seems that every time they want to advance to a new arc but there is no backbone that interconnects things, there are a lot of characters who are honestly a lot of nothing, and will probably be forgotten because their functions are so shallow in the work that they do not benefit at all a completely predictable story.<br />
<br />
Why should I care about Tamaki&#039;s sister? There isn’t enough construction to make all this drama believable, it’s exactly that kind of drama that wants you to care about characters that don’t even exist, let me clear your mind with: Bunny girl the movie, Osomatsu the movie, Haruhi and Ano Hana, I don&#039;t know how they haven&#039;t created a genre called &#039;&#039; please care about nothing&#039;&#039;, which lives up to this kind of lazy and dishonest story with a viewer. Then we have a shit drama of two friends who fight all the time and stop being friends, and again, why should I care? The anime introduces them in an episode and already wants to make a conflict on top of that, that&#039;s not how characters are built and much less make the viewer care.<br />
<br />
Is it an act of cowardice to appeal to dramas you don&#039;t even know, I admit it&#039;s one of the things I hate the most in fiction, and guess what this drama was for? Nothing at all, you already understand that they fight every moment and then return to friendship, it&#039;s a cycle. But this is not the worst part, it is when he introduces a story / element in the same episode to justify this drama, yes, I am talking about the stairs, elements completely played when it suits, the only character that showed interest to me was Nanami for that at least, she has an introduction and then it takes time to build it, which at least I value here.<br />
<br />
While the other characters are only placed because they want them to be there to cover a minor conflict, I think that only one character has become relevant to introduce a plot consequence that still this character is totally poorly constructed, I&#039;m talking about Kaede here, we will only have a cycle of meeting characters and then bringing them into a great arc and then discarding them as if they were nothing. Not even the narrative collaborates to guarantee a good experience, I can&#039;t believe that a story we experience, that before defied a whole genre to end up being something absolutely generic, there is no clear difference in this series for a low quality manga that calls itself &#039;&#039; dark mahou shoujo. &#039;&#039;<br />
<br />
This anime manages to be anything but Madoka magica, it does not risk anything, it does not show a certain danger in the world, or in intentions that could show the purpose of this story to exist in order to take the viewer along, it seems that something totally without the soul of its original. I don’t know why they need to hold on so much and limit this material, there’s even a scene where it could result in sacrifice caused by Tamaki’s weakness, but again the anime ignores what could be important and still be a bridge to build between selfish desires. Not even the fights are good, they have a horrible choreography, the storyboard is even more messy, just take a look between episodes 4 and 5 to be able to see them, even if the story was flawed and totally predictable, I wanted to take advantage of the fights, but they fucked it up, I think that only the art and soundtrack is really pleasant, the direction kept going at the beginning, and then it lost its identity, it seems like an attempt to imitate Shinbou&#039;s steps, but it totally fails in that, everything that he tried to give meaning ends up being.<br />
<br />
I would not recommend this series to a madoka fan who is looking for something interesting in the franchise, this is just a bait to get money for a gacha and put bad fanservices in the series, like Mami becoming a Deus X machina for the second time, no it&#039;s not even rewarding to see a remarkable character becoming a cheap script artifice, if you want to see something that resembles Madoka, just watch Granbelm, although you may hate the recommendation, I tell you it&#039;s better to be a bad original story than a story that only serves to get more milk from a cow that is already dead, and that dead cow is called Madoka Magica.<br />

    Being a fan of the Original series and the movie Rebellion, I was excited about Magia Record as soon as I found the game is being adapted into the anime. Being a side story, this is not intended to surpass the original, but give a whole new experience which is not dark and shocking as the original storywise, but this doesn&#039;t make the story bad at all, which we&#039;ll see as the plot progresses.<br />
<br />
STORY : 8<br />
The story focuses on new characters. You&#039;ll see the usual enemies of Magical Girls, along with some new ones. The pacing might feel slow or fast depending on whether you&#039;ve

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327728">
        played the game. Some details might feel unnecessary, but they are essential to the plot. Nothing &#039;wow&#039; has happened as of episode 4, but things will get interesing episode 5 onwards. The events might raise some questions in your mind, if you&#039;ve watched Madoka Magica. Overall this story is good, and will definitely get better, just don&#039;t expect it to be original level good; you&#039;d be disappointed.<br />
<br />
ART : 10<br />
Games generate quite a revenue, and Magia Record definitely has bigger budget than your average anime. The show is being made in 1080p native, and it looks great quality wise. I&#039;d say the animation is on par with Rebellion, which was a movie. The animation is trippy as ever, and the witch, labrinth designs are as you&#039;d expect them to be. The transformation sequences are like Rebellion, and they are gorgeous. I think this is the best TV series ever made by Shaft animation-wise.<br />
<br />
SOUND : 9<br />
The anime borrows some soundtrack from the original, but has it&#039;s own original too. Yuki Kajiura has not composed the music for this series, but you&#039;re not likely to spot any difference in the quality. OP is performed by Trysail, who also voice the three main characters. ED is performed by Claris. I don&#039;t skip the OP / ED for the show, so yeah it does well in the sound department.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS : 10<br />
Characters are lovable, most of them being Magical Girls. There are a lot of them, but the main focus is on main cast; three of them have been introduced as of episode 4. Every character has some part to play, so even you may see a lot of them, they are crucial to the plot. If you&#039;ve played the game, you&#039;ll be happy to see your favorites making cameos.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT : 10<br />
Every episode ends way too quick for me, and I enjoy every second of it. The art is great, the characters are likeable (except for Kyubey). The story is interesting if you care enough about the new characters, and the music and soundtracks are as good as the original. So you&#039;ll enjoy it if you don&#039;t watch it expecting to be Madoka Magica 2.0, since it&#039;s not. It&#039;s more like a side quest to know more about the world of Madoka Magica and meet some new characters. It&#039;s mysterious, but not dark or psychological. There&#039;ll be gags and the atmosphere will be lighter. <br />
<br />
OVERALL : 10 <br />
This one will not give you depression or cure it, but the experience will be heart-warming. You&#039;ll see the power of friendship, but in a non-typical manner. If you&#039;re a true fan of Madoka Magica, you can&#039;t skip it. If you haven&#039;t watched Madoka Magica, you should first watch it (including the third movie) to fully understand and appreciate this. Overall, it&#039;s definitely a good show and must watch. <br />

    Allow me to preface this by stating - Madoka Magica is one of my favorite anime of all time. Even so, I went into this with tempered expectations, knowing it was tied into a gacha game. Even so, I was still disappointed.<br />
<br />
Story: 1<br />
Seeming like something out of a fanfiction at the best of times, and the ramblings out of a middle schooler&#039;s first creative writing project at the worst of times. <br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
The art is decent most of the time. All of Curry&#039;s art is still absolutely wonderful to behold. But an over-reliance on blatant 3D as well as several animation errors easily pull you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333376">
        out of the show.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6<br />
Nothing is particular out of place. And all of the original show&#039;s soundtrack is used well, if over-relied upon.<br />
<br />
Characters: 1<br />
One of Madoka Magica&#039;s greatest strength was keeping its main cast very small. Concise, well developed, and fleshed out. Magia Record does the opposite of this. Characters introduced in the first five episodes are brushed aside, and only get token appearances afterwards while new characters struggle to take their place. In the end, I struggled to even remember their names.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1<br />
Shallow, and a waste of a great IP that could have been used to tell far more original stories. Every episode simply left me disappointed.<br />
<br />
Overall: 1<br />
It would merely be mediocre, if the ending to the season didn&#039;t threaten to tie this story in with the main series&#039; in some large fashion. Keeping it self contained was clearly not good enough, but they couldn&#039;t be bothered to tie it into Madoka Magica in a meaningful way. And ending your show on sequel bait is just bad practice.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Madoka Magica&#039;s core strengths can be boiled down to three key points in my mind.<br />
<br />
1.The show&#039;s story is told very tightly, and concisely. With twelve episodes, they waste none of your time. Almost every scene is dedicated either to setting up later plot points, developing character, or moving the story right along at a strong pace.<br />
<br />
2.The number of named characters could be counted on two hands easily. Their arcs are well defined, their character fleshed out, and each one has a satisfying, if sometimes untimely conclusion.<br />
<br />
3.The story itself, one of loyalty and dedication, transcends the Magical Girl genre and could easily be told just as it were in a Science Fiction, Fantasy, or a number of other genres. Making it easily relatable.<br />
<br />
To this end, Magia Record fails not only to capture the core strengths of the original show, but goes so far as to fail spectacularly at every single one of these points. The story meanders and is unfocused, the initial drive for the main character is never resolved - partly due to the cliffhanger ending the season stops on. The number of characters the show introduces is an order of magnitude larger than the original&#039;s. Many of them not appearing more than once or twice before disappearing inexplicably. And the main crux of the story is based purely around them being magical girls, with no room for anything else. Magia Record tries to peddle some lofty ideas while failing to capture the pure simplicity that made Madoka Magica so strong.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, it&#039;s just a shameless little tie-in to a gacha game with very little soul. Hardly any of the staff from the original show is involved, so really I&#039;m not surprised. And yet, still, my disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined.

    Story - 8<br />
<br />
It is impossible for it to be better than Madoka, but I am loving the mysterious setting and can&#039;t wait to find out the secrets. I don&#039;t understand why people are hating the story so much, I have found it very enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Art - 10<br />
<br />
As expected of a Shaft anime, it looks amazing and there is plenty of hidden messages that you have to pause and analyse to fully take in the episodes.<br />
<br />
Sound - 10<br />
<br />
I am loving the background music and the voice acting is great.<br />
<br />
Character - 8<br />
<br />
There are a lot of characters due to it being a mobile game so I can see

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327704">
        why people are complaining. However, at this point there are only like 10 characters, a lot of animes have over 10 characters within 4 episodes. People are just comparing it to the small cast of Madoka Magica. The characters are well written and I can relate to a few of them.<br />
<br />
Overall - 10<br />
<br />
I am very happy to see another Madoka anime and it has massively exceeded my expectations for a mobile game. I am also very excited to see the original cast again as they can be seen in the opening

    I am a huge fan of the original story &quot; madoka magica&quot; i had high expectations for the side story didn&#039;t even play the game and waited patiently till 2020 <br />
And here is what i think about the show:<br />
<br />
1- the major problem with this show that it&#039;s too fast, they introduce you to 3 girls at once in one episode and forget about a girl we saw in the first one ! What is going on ! Are they supposed to be humans or just walking figures ,<br />
they also force these emotions they try so hard to make it sad and dark, there is no

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328580">
        build up in the story line characters are just jumping from being mad for no rational reason to being sad(btw they try to justify these characteristics features but it doesn&#039;t work for me still dumb)...<br />
<br />
2-As i wished the studio did a great amazing job with the art style it was clear that what i am watching is in the madoka universe, colors and backgrounds high quality and beautiful<br />
<br />
3-for music i was so disappointed, the opening sounded like one of these forgettable, stereotypical,low budget openings ...so boring<br />
But during the show they used the OSTs of the original Madoka which i really liked especially in the first few minutes of ep 1 <br />
<br />
4-The characters are poorly written, not interesting at all, i didn&#039;t like how they act, their clothes design is dull felt like i was watching Sword art online, and why is the main character is so weak?<br />
Isn&#039;t she supposed to be strong to fight witches? why giving he soul gem in the first place if all what she could do is tickling her enemies with that cute arrow<br />
<br />
I really wanted to love it felt like i was betraying my beloved Madoka for dropping it

    As a huge fan of the original Madoka Magica tv series and the movies I was really hoping forward to watching a continuation or side story to the already existing material, but this feels like a botched attempt to replicate Bakemonogatari. <br />
<br />
What I liked:<br />
-It looks and sounds mostly like the old anime, although the music doesn&#039;t stand out as much as the original<br />
-It still has that crispy unique artstyle that changes to borderline absurd when the witch fights happen<br />
And thats it<br />
<br />
The issues:<br />
-It keeps shoving characters in my face that I don&#039;t care about, like, they introdouce 5 characters in 1 episode and expect me to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328345">
        care about when something happens to them, while I&#039;m still trying to process who these people are<br />
-Not really thought or emotion provoking, in one episode this girl gets kidnapped, but the resolution is that she becomes friends with her friend again, gee.. thanks? Isn&#039;t the thing that made the original so good that it broke clichés?<br />
-The character costumes and powers are bland, why do these people have these powers? Is there a reason? No, its all generic. In the original they got their power from their wish, like for instance the girl who deceived people had a spear that turned into a snake, but here they don&#039;t even explain character motivations or anything like that so thats all thrown out the window<br />
<br />
My overall score is a 5, its not unwatchable and I can see someone enjoying it, but it just feels like a poor attempt to cash in on a show that broke boundries and defined a genre.<br />
<br />

    I will start by saying that I think any kind of art review should be able to first and foremost consider the piece of art in question on its own. It would be simple to just compare this series to the original Madoka Magica, which was the original work upon which this series spins off. However, that would not be fair nor, in my opinion, helpful to people who are reading reviews.<br />
<br />
Magia Record is better than most anime out there in every way. The art and sound, as virtually everything created by Shaft, is of the highest quality. It&#039;s creative and elicits strong emotions in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333679">
        the viewer. The use of lighting and backgrounds and action sequences are used effectively to provide something that is visually stunning and satisfying.<br />
<br />
The story and characters are also strong, but they suffer a little due to the fact that this series is adapted from a mobile gacha game. As the reader is probably aware, gacha games are based on the idea that the player will collect as many characters as possible and develop them for play and story. This means that there are more named characters than are really appropriate for a story like this, and it means that none of them really gets developed as fully as one would hope, since most of them get their own arcs. That being said, each of the characters are still better developed and more interesting than the majority of anime characters out there. Additionally, this story, as opposed to the original Madoka Magica, has more potential to be an ongoing series, rather than having a beginning-middle-end all in one season. This means that what was started here will likely grow into something even more interesting as more is released.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, if you enjoy the Madoka Magica universe, you will enjoy this.

    For a mobile gacha game, Magia Record’s story is serviceable. It’s the perfect breather in between gameplay, and it’s constructed in a way that allows many characters to coexist. Overall, it keeps the player coming back thanks to the pull of the mystery, as well as the ever-growing roster of magical girls to collect.<br />
<br />
As the first anime installment in the Madoka Magica franchise since the Rebellion movie, Magia Record needed to be more than serviceable. The original twelve episode series, as well as its movie, are extremely well-regarded thanks to their iconic characters, intriguing plot, and immaculate pacing. It’s been a long seven years since

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333293">
        then, and as such, Magia Record had a lot to live up to. In order for this adaptation to work well, some smart changes needed to be made to make it fit the anime medium. However, Magia Record suffers because, ironically, it is too faithful to the source material.<br />
<br />
The biggest issue that viewers seem to have with this show is its pacing, and I would have to agree. Too many characters are introduced far too quickly, and the show does not have enough time to develop them and the plot at the same time. The story tends to race past moments that deserve attention and linger on moments of meandering. With the plot constantly shifting between these two extremes, it can be difficult to grasp who these characters are beyond their initial traits, making them seem like caricatures. All of this makes it difficult to feel invested in anything or anyone in the story.<br />
<br />
It isn’t all bad, though. The art and aesthetics of Magia Record are frequently gorgeous. Even in dull moments, there is enough eye-candy on the screen to keep your attention. Furthermore, though the music had little chance of matching Yuki Kaijura’s original masterpiece of a score, it has some interesting and memorable tracks. The direction is hit and miss; though action scenes are frequently confusing, messy, and poorly animated, the quieter scenes are often much more engaging.<br />
<br />
Overall, Magia Record, as an anime, fails to live up to its predecessors’ standard of quality. Its story and characters are mediocre, but its pleasing presentation will delight those who value visuals over everything else. In my opinion, this show is best enjoyed by not taking it too seriously and by having fun with its messier moments. This is how I will be approaching the second season of Magia Record when it airs, as I continue to wait patiently for a sequel to Rebellion worthy of the Madoka Magica title.

    I have the original Madoka Magical series a perfect 10. This is nothing like that series. Aside from a few very superficial connections, they aren&#039;t related at all, or really even similar in any manner. Without getting into the events of the original show, which I highly recommend, it doesn&#039;t seem possible that this show could even cannonicly exist in it&#039;s universe.<br />
<br />
I could not follow the story of this series. The main character is searching for her sister, but never actually tried to do anything that would lead her to find her sister. It&#039;s not really clear how she lives, or why anything related to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333465">
        her happens at all. <br />
<br />
This series introduces way too many side characters, and not a single one of them is important, even a little. They ar there to look cute for the mobile game that this show is based on. Many episodes are them introducing a character, barely suggesting that maybe they have a backstory, and then they disapear, an make cameos in other news girl&#039;s episodes.<br />
<br />
This show isn&#039;t fun to watch, doesn&#039;t make any sense, and over all feels like it was made by a group of fans that sort of liked the original series, but didn&#039;t get anything about it&#039;s tone or character development. It&#039;s the single biggest disappointment of this year in anime so far, and any show that might beat it out will have to be trying very hard.

    I feel like there&#039;s a lot of people who said this show was &quot;fine&quot; or &quot;average&quot; because it&#039;s not as groundbreaking as the original Madoka, which I think is kind of unfair.  Why would you expect the same kind of mindblowing revelations from this show that Madoka had, when it literally says its a spin-off set in the same world? Too much drama in the same vein as Madoka would make it feel cheap, in my opinion. <br />
<br />
Personally, I enjoyed this show because it introduces so many characters (which I admit can get annoying to follow for some people), giving the viewer insight towards

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333353">
        the lives of most magical girls who are not the Holy Quintet. The art and animation are amazing, thanks to Shaft, and the ost is really good for setting the tone of specific scenes as well. <br />
<br />
The story, which is the most debated part of this show, is not as confusing as all the negative reviews say. The plot is straightforward. Basically, our pink-haired protagonist Iroha Tamaki comes to Kamihama City to search for her sister who no one remembers exists, and meets a bunch of other quirky magical girls along the way, who help her search for her sister while uncovering a conspiracy. (I would say more but that&#039;s spoiling) There&#039;s also a s2 in production, which sheds light on why the story&#039;s pacing can seem weird at times. <br />
<br />
I think this show just suffers from being compared to Madoka too much, even though the kind of story it&#039;s trying to tell is very different.
