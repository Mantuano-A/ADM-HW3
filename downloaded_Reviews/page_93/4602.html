Lamune tells the story of a boy named Kenji and his childhood friend Nanami. Although, everyone seems to know that they have a relationship, neither are determined to push it anymore than close friends. The story goes through flashbacks, explaining why they are such close friends and any action doesn&#039;t seem to push them apart, but draw them closer. (Source: ANN)" />

    Lamune is a Slice of Life, Romance, Comedy, Drama about a boy (Kenji) and girl (Nanami) who grew up together and lately have begun to have feelings for each other, but don’t admit to them.  Nothing new about this childhood friend romantic set-up; but unlike similar anime that prefer to bombard us with drama, angst and romance, Lamune is more of a calm, relaxed series to go with the rural setting. Each episode tends to begin with a flashback, of some event in their childhood and then proceeds to relate it in some way to the story&#039;s present events. Yet with this being a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4413">
        short series, the story happens to move at a snail’s pace, with each episode only managing to cover a small bit of ground. This really takes away some of the enjoyment but still it&#039;s easy to end up continuing anyway.<br />
<br />
With the story revolving around the characters, they all are fairly important. Being one of the few male characters in the series, Kenji does do a decent job as the protagonist and is really reliable but a lot of the jokes he pulls can be fairly petty. The girls have rather typical personalities for this kind of series plus have one thing in common, they’re all overly cute. Of course Nanami stands out from the rest but at least they all get their moment.<br />
<br />
The animation has an equal amount of good and bad points that make it hard to judge. The environments are nice &amp; vibrant and the character designs look good (cute girls of course); however, at a distant, the characters look just plain crap and there are some inconsistencies in the detail of their design.<br />
<br />
The music of this series is mostly just a bunch of soft &amp; simple melodies, which can get repetitive after a while. And Seeing how this series is set around the summer, expect to hear the all familiar ambient sounds (cicadas).<br />
<br />
Overall Lamune is a tranquil and fairly enjoyable slice of life romance, which is as light-hearted as an anime can get (other than Aria of course). Though due to the issues involved in each episode, being so minor, it’s easy to get bored of this uninspiring anime series. Also with the romance going nowhere most of the time, it can feel like a waste of time. At least this anime is good enough and short enough to finish in one sitting and it has a somewhat fulfilling ending. So if you want to quickly breeze through a laid back anime then this one should do the job.

    Story: Well the story is pretty normal. It&#039;s the perfect example of what real life in the country side is like. The series starts out pretty slow, basically explaining who the two main characters are, why they&#039;re so close, and how they first met. Gradually as you watch each episode you learn a little more about the two and their relationship, while also getting introduced to other friends. To be fair, wile starting this series, don&#039;t expect to be drawn in by drama, conflict, or a compelling story because this show has next to none at all. It&#039;s a simple story about two kids that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review2639">
        grow up liking each other and not even realizing it till something happens. <br />
<br />
Art: The character design is surprisingly well done. The girl characters are really attractive and the male characters dress more like todays young teens do. The colors used for specific scenes where also great, however the few times they used CG (ie. the alien video game) was really bad and should not ever have been done.<br />
<br />
Sound: The music also fit good with the show. Sound effects for the Bikes and storm where also done great.<br />
<br />
Character: Character personality&#039;s where pretty good, with the exception of a few characters. All seemed to fit well with the show though. As I already stated in the art part, the characters clothes where close to what young teens currently where now and the way the characters interacted seemed realistic as well. It wasn&#039;t like most anime shows where people are either a class clown/bully or a class president. Everyone seemed like they where on the same level so to speak.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: At the start of the show it didn&#039;t feel all that enjoyable, however once I started to get to know more about each character, I felt compelled to learn more. The ending was a nice dramatic touch to a relatively mellow series.<br />
<br />
Overall: If you&#039;re looking for a real slice of life series where the male character is only bound to one girl and slowly gets closer to her, then this is for you. Personally before even starting this show, from the look of the cover and the summary, I had originally thought this was going to be another slice of life/harem where the male lead has to choose between several of his fellow attractive classmates that like him. But I was totally wrong. Don&#039;t get me wrong though, there are a few girls that seem to like him but as the story progresses they simply realize they wont be able to compete against the bond that he and his childhood friend Nanami share so they give up on him fast. The series was a great time killer!

    Lamune is nothing less than a simple light-hearted, comedic romance. But even then it is fairly enjoyable.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Story: 6/10<br />
------------------<br />
In Lamune, every episode begins with a flashback from the past, detailing a section of the childhood relationship of the two main characters, Nanami and Kenji. What was depicted in the flashback is then, in one way or another connected to the main story which admittedly is not much. Lamune adopts a storyline we’ve seen too many times in anime- the ‘childhood friend romance’. Even so, it is one of the best to take advantage of this. It’s comedy revolves around the two main characters and some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review130523">
        of the supporting characters to poke around in the main characters bubble to create a very light humour in the series. The story overall is peaceful, with little dramas and being all about the growing relationship between Nanami and Kenji. Though predictable, one can ignore this if they aren’t expecting it to be the most absolutely amazing masterpiece. What this anime is for is the ride. A peaceful one where you should simply relax, sip some tea and watch all in one sitting. The ending, being entirely satisfying promotes it to become a very solid romance anime.<br />
<br />
The Art: 8/10<br />
---------------<br />
For a 2005 anime, its art is actually quite pretty. The character designs truly do look similar, but the bright colours on each and every one of the characters make them look entirely different in a way and this makes them likeable, and memorable. The background looks like a professional artist painting on an expensive canvas creating scenery of the green and lush countryside. Yes, it’s actually that good. The director attempted to create a neutral scene to compliment the mood of the story and at that- it was undeniably successful. <br />
<br />
The Sound: 7/10<br />
-------------------<br />
Character voice actors were very fitting for the ones portrayed in the anime. Voice complimented character figure, and character figure complimented the voice. Seiyuus, physically seemed like they matched the condition of the specific role they played and so little natural voice alteration was not needed. Background music is fitting for the story, from the noise rain makes on the concrete to the natural noises in forest walks- the sound was very fitting for the atmosphere. The opening isn’t that particularly interesting, neither is the ending soundtrack. The only thing they provided or the viewer was to convey the emotion you’re meant to feel while watching the anime- and the opening scenes helped to reinforce that and prepare you for what was lying ahead.<br />
<br />
The Characters: 7/10<br />
------------------------<br />
The characters were made entirely stereotypical. The regular guy you see- not overly perverse but to the extent of blushes and staring at the girl with her underwear showing before looking away after realising she’s looking directly at him. Then you have the girl who’s a bit blunt- as well as being overly innocent and slow to catch on. Then the shy girl- the one who can’t confess and needs her friends help to start making a move. Then the younger sister figure who teases around his older brother and girlfriend’s relationship. Nothing we haven’t seen before, but then at least it’s not horrible. Character development was evidently slow, but it’s quite suitable because of the time span in the anime from the first episode to the last. The supporting cast had a suitable number of characters but none of them were really developed in the story. <br />
<br />
The Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
------------------------<br />
Others looking for a non-dramatic ride in an anime would probably enjoy this. I know I sure did, especially right after watching a romance anime with the most horrible ending ever. Ever. I’ll probably never re-watch this, and you’ll probably not either if you were to view this as well. Ultimately, it’s just too plain. You won’t rediscover mind-blowing things by re-watching this, nor will you gain anymore satisfaction from it. It’s best to be used as a one-time-only anime. <br />
<br />
Overall: 7/10<br />
---------------<br />
Overall, this anime is a good change from all the teary-dramatic romance anime you find nowadays. This is basically a slice-of-life anime without the heartbreaks and serious atmosphere. A great time filler, recommended if you’re not looking for something thoughtful.<br />

    I usually don&#039;t write reviews but this one is an exception, (well atleast for now). I saw the whole series on a free sunday so that might influence my opinion a bit. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Well the story takes a while before it gets interesting. In the first part you get to know the character pretty well, they refer to the past between the two leads which shows the true friendship between them. That true friendsip also gets in the way with a romatic relationship. Their relationship grows bigger and bigger without them noticing it in the first place, or maby its denial, I still haven&#039;t figured out

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5164">
        that part yet. The friends of the leads allready know all about their relationship and it takes untill the end for them to figure that out themselve. Overall its a cute anime but in my opinion it takes a bit too long before anything interesting is happening. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The artwork is pretty great if you ask me, the looks of the character fit their true nature pretty well. The girls looks cute and the boys, well i guess they look like boys in real life. The clothing looks fasionable aqnd the surroundings look pretty nice aswell. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The background music, voices and sound affects are very good. But the ambient sound effects do get a bit dull after hearing them for 12 episodes.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
The lead character are pretty unique, the characters surrounding them are also unique but are in my opinion too flat. You dont really know anything about the surrounding characters after watching the whole anime. Which is quite a shame.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Dont let the comment above fool you. The reason that I chose to review this anime is because I really liked it a lot! There was humor that makes you laugh out loud and there was drama that makes you cry. It was enjoyable enough to make me watch the whole series in 1 day.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
If you are looking for an anime that is enjoyable without the harem aspect, and without too mucht school drama, I guess this is the anime for you! Don&#039;t let the slow start discourage you from watching it till the end. The ending is pretty surprising and it wont be a waste of time. <br />

    I love this series very much and the story is totally enjoyed for me. At first I think this is be gonna boring story and totaly dork but after watched on the second and third episode I realize something that the story is totally different with the most common school life anime.<br />
<br />
I like the setting story in urban country where I can feel relaxed so much wathed this anime. The sound and music is very nice I can feel wind of the beach on myself while watching this series.<br />
<br />
The character is totally very good like nanami is very beautiful, cute, and i like her face

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9709">
        when angry at the heroic character Ken-chan (the name she called him) insulted her. The character of heroic is very gentle , dependable, and all what he do is totally similiar to very perfect gentle man must be.<br />
<br />
So, this anime is awesome when you depressing with your life this is anime maybe can raise your spirit again , sorry with my poor english...^^

    This title made me cry.<br />
<br />
This is one reason why I started liking anime based of visual novels due to the fact that the writing style most visual novels are to my liking. While it is a normal slice of life, where the the story is set in a boondocks where farming and peaceful rural life is thriving, this anime provide a heartwarming atmosphere that will let you feel like living in that place.<br />
<br />
Story: It starts out like a normal kind of slice of life where explains about the past of the childhood sweethearts, Nanami and Kenji, telling us the sweet innocent relationship between the two.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37821">
        While other characters started to pop out in the story testing the two into a set of trials, until both of them realizes the importance of each other. If you are a person who would be easily swayed by drama then I guarantee that you will cry or at least shed half a tear for the last two episodes of the story.<br />
<br />
Characters: Kenji is so cool, hardboiled man and a stubborn guy but acts like a real brother to Nanami. Nanami who is Kenji&#039;s childhood friend is a very sweet, innocent and hard-working lady who devotedly will do anything for Kenji. The supporting characters are also portrayed good and given with nice personalities. It makes you want to live in a place where they can be your neighbors.<br />
<br />
Art and Sound:<br />
Probably not the best graphics and sound but these have the quality that are exceptionally decent and probably you wouldn&#039;t complain about. While the OP is not a last song syndrome material, it is good to be heard twice or thrice since it has a good feel to it. Characters are drawn perfectly well and expect some very mild ecchi.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Like I said before, this series made me cry. Re-watching it also made me cry again. If you are curious why I cried then get the hell out of here and watch it. Watch it, understand the plot, feel the characters. By the time you get to the high pinnacle of the story, you have to grasped the theme of the story and I tell you this anime is one of the titles you&#039;ll never forget. I don&#039;t have to put here what will happen in the story but I bet you&#039;ll wish you have childhood friend after you finish the last episode.

    There is a fine line between a relaxing anime, and a boring anime. I find Lamune to be the former, but it&#039;s not going to surprise me if more people find it to be the latter. <br />
<br />
The story follows two childhood friends, Kenji and Nanami, who only realized their feelings for each other after certain events in the story and thus the two starts a new kind of relationship. Lamune is simple, cute and as straight-forward as a childhood friend romance as it can be. There is no overarching storyline - actually I think I just spoiled a third of the story by giving that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195353">
        synopsis. The show heavily focuses on slice-of-life and is mainly driven by romance and a bit of drama. While Lamune doesn&#039;t really bring anything new to the table, it&#039;s really soothing to watch. Sometimes you just have to take a break from watching all those over-the-top teenage melodrama.<br />
<br />
The music and voice acting is good, character designs looks great, but the animation quality is subpar and sometimes almost cringe-worthy but for an anime with a low production cost it&#039;s passable.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for an anime with lots of heavy drama and plot twists you should just skip this one because this is definitely not for you, but if you&#039;re just looking for a light-hearted romance anime that&#039;s easy to digest then you might want to give this one a try, well I certainly didn&#039;t feel like I&#039;ve wasted my time watching this.<br />

    Lamune is a short series that tells the love story of two very close friends. It follows an episodic format that usually starts with some flashback of them in their childhood days explaining bits of their history and how it relates to their present selves. The series started slow with most of the episode focuses on one particular event or problems and how they handle it. Each passing episode feels like their feelings for each other keeps on getting stronger but the two wouldn&#039;t admit it to themselves. Admittedly, the pacing and format will become boring for a while with no significant events to throw

        their relationship off guard. Things finally starts to get interesting in the last few episodes with a series of events that will make the two close friends finally realized the feelings they keep on holding for each other.<br />
<br />
The animation has both good and bad points. The environment is nicely detailed as it nicely portrays the serenity of a countryside life. The character designs also looks good especially since all the girls looks cute, however poor production quality is observable as the characters just looks awkward sometimes. Good thing there is a noticeably improvement in the overall quality of the designs towards the end.<br />
<br />
The music feels good enough and appropriate for the series but it never tends to be noticeable. The OP and ED is catchy and lively enough to increase my interest for the series and portray its overall theme.<br />
<br />
The series has a small amount of cast, mostly girls which all looks cute in my opinion. Each cast is given enough screen time for the viewers to like their characters and everyone feels unique. The voice actors did a  fairly good job presenting the characters they are portraying, although I have to admit that the voice behind Konoe Nanami needs a bit more time to getting used to, it tends to get on my nerves during the start of the series but eventually I get used to it in the later part.<br />
<br />
Lamune is a series that I enjoy all throughout, it tends to become boring for a while with its episodic format but not enough to decrease my overall enjoyment. Things started to get interesting during the later part and feels complete in the end. The plot is fairly straightforward with some twist during the later part.  Recommended for viewers seeking slice of life shows that contains romance, bits of comedy, and drama.

    Rating: 7/10<br />
I don&#039;t know how but this average, light heart anime was actually fun to watch. OH WAIT! WHERE THE HECK IS THE KISS SCENE AT THE END OF THE ANIME<br />
<br />
Story:7/10<br />
<br />
The story in this anime wasn&#039;t really bad or anything. In fact if i had watched this anime as a beginner i would rate it a 10 but at this point i could see how average it was. I liked most of the romance and drama in the story and it really added to the enjoyment for me. Even though this was an average anime I still found some of it&#039;s concepts to be unique.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review192771">
        I especially liked the direction they took with the ending and how they executed the story. As i said, the romance and drama in the story were great but they did lack of in a few areas as well. The anime was very predictable and i really found it annoying at times. Before watching this anime i took a look at the title, description and genre and i knew what expect when watching this anime. The next thing that i found really frustrating was the ending again. Though i said i liked the conclusion earlier, i still found it to be a bit disappointing. Earlier i said i could predict what would happen but the one prediction that i was actually looking forward to did not come true. The kiss scene was missing and i found that to be really frustrating. It was as if i watched the entire story develop and at the end they just shat on it. They just shat on their story and that is what skipping the kiss scene is like to me. Ugh, it feels like school days all over again.<br />
<br />
Art:6/10<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t say much about the art because you might already might know what to expect. It has vivid colors but it lacks beauty and originality. Basically it was an alright anime for the time it was made.<br />
<br />
Sound:6/10<br />
<br />
I watched the subbed and to me, the voice actors did an okay job in the characters&#039; voicing. Like i said this is an average anime so don&#039;t expect them to be powerful enough to make you cry or pee your self. The do alright and nothing more. Then there is the sound track they used. While watching this anime they really did a great job in filling in music for the romance scenes and drama scenes but then they did something with the music that actually made me want to sleep. I hate it when you&#039;re watching a story and for each and every second of the story their is music playing. It felt as if their was background music playing throughout the entire anime and that really made me drowsy at times. It was like watching Lifetime with my mom.<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
<br />
You must have already guessed from reading the description that the character development would be good and you would be right to think that to a degree. Most of the side characters get this development with Kenji the main character. You get to understand the struggle each of these characters go through and you could actually relate to some of them. Overall you could just say that the characters back stories were developed nicely but there were a few issues with them. The chemistry between the characters were lacking and in more ways than one. The first way might actually be the animators fault but it still doesn&#039;t excuse the few seconds of silence when the characters talk to each other. Sometimes these characters would be talking and every time a character would stop talking there would be like a 2 or 3 seconds of silence. I found that really weird and a bit dumb. It was as if they did it intentionally to fill in the 22 minutes of the anime. The next problem were how bland some of the characters were. Sometimes they would be talking and i wouldn&#039;t even care about what they have to say because i would forget it any way. You don&#039;t even want to know some of these characters and you don&#039;t really want to root for anyone except for Nanami. But even Nanami was bland at times.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:9/10<br />
<br />
At this point you might be wondering why i gave the anime a 9/10 rating for enjoyment.Yeah, sure i disliked a lot of things in this anime, but i can&#039;t deny that I hate the average childhood story. It&#039;s like water in a way, We all know what it tastes like but it&#039;s always refreshing at the end of the day. Though at times the music made me want to sleep, i still enjoyed the bond between Nanami and Kenji. I was always rooting for the too because i could relate to them both. Nanime was cute Innocent and Kenji was the nice guy who probably didn&#039;t deserve her. I always enjoy these types of relationships and i like it even more when the developed on it. I always enjoy a good romantic anime and i certainly enjoyed this one so that&#039;s why i gave it a 9 out of 10 rating. <br />
<br />
Overall:7/10

    A different kind of story then most when it comes to love stories.<br />
<br />
The story seemed very original to me. Having two people being in love but too afraid to tell each other.  I would almost say it definitely a better romance drama, so if you like that sort thing this one is a must. I only saw one real down side to the story and that was the ending. I was a little to cliche for my tastes other than that it was a pretty good story if you have 8 hours to watch it.

    I rarely write reviews....but this anime is so underrated that I just had to.<br />
<br />
I had &quot;Lamune on my plan to watch list for years...for literally about 5 years before i got the courage to start it, and boy do I not regret now that decision.<br />
<br />
I write this review just barely now, after finishing the last episode, and I am still in a warm shocked state. I can still feel the dried tears on my cheeks and I have a subtle smile on my face as I write this.<br />
<br />
The show starts up laid back and relaxing...but what happened in the development of the episodes(especially the last

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205270">
        ones) is why I would call this a masterpiece. I don&#039;t want to spoil anything about it so this will be a spoiler free review.<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
<br />
The story starts slow and relaxing as I said, but just trust me, especially if you are a romance fan (with big bits of slice of life and drama)...you will end up loving this...i don&#039;t want to say anything about the story, so I invite you to just watch it<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
<br />
Considering it&#039;s 2005, the art is good. The main girl is really cute, and there are some bits where the art looks lovely, while others where it looks average.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
<br />
The OP and ED are ok-ish...the OP is decent. I thought this anime didn&#039;t have an OP or ED until halfway through because i watched a version of it where they were chopped up.<br />
Buuuut the OST is gorgeous, really lovely piano music, and erfectly blended with the story line.<br />
<br />
Characters: 9/10<br />
<br />
The two MC are awesome...again i would spoil if i&#039;d say more. They are just good...and they get awesomer as the story progresses.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
<br />
As i said...the story starts slow, but once it goes past a certain point...it will become epic, and every part of it will make more sense, even why it was so slow.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
IF you are a Romance anime fan, and want to see a series that does Romance as it should be done...definetely watch it! But be warned...it&#039;s so good you will be left to want more...as i want right now, and unfortunately this anime does not seem to have a manga, or sequel, or anything else besides these 12 episodes. So enjoy them throughfully.<br />
<br />
Hope I made up your mind to try it out, romance anime fan...So if I did please enjoy the show! :)

    &quot;Lamune&quot; –  an ordinary &quot;slice of life&quot; story without magic, sci-fi or other elements, which usually try to raise various alike animes up in viewers eyes. For the biggest part of audience this anime will always be an average work that сan&#039;t express itself as an interesting project, containing something worth to see. However, the lack of individual features don&#039;t turn these series into a horrible unwatchable disaster, it&#039;s pretty enjoyable if you are a fan of the current genre and you are not scared to face its inherent components: easy to follow story containing a spoonful comedy and a drop of drama, incoherent

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27375">
        storyline (faintly connected episodes) splited in arcs each one concentrates on relationship between main male char and one of his female friends (the same old song).<br />
Indeed, sometimes chilled fizzy &quot;Lemonade&quot; tastes like a totaly template boredom. There are neither unexpected events nor true-to-life characters – that&#039;s why it feels uncomplete as a &quot;slice of life&quot;, where the plot shouldn&#039;t be thus naive. Though I watched the anime till the final titles and partly liked it. Why? Because of its kindness and purity. Picture Magic studio managed to keep innocent atmosphere, despite the fact that &quot;Lamune&quot; is based on same-titled eroge; fan service was a rare guest.<br />
From the technical point of view, judging without fear or favor, the anime is mean even for times when it was out. Appearence and outfits of characters are feeble. The biggest cos I noticed during watch is indentity looking (except their hair color) of Suzuka and Nanami. Whos mistake is it – the anime scenarists, that described сhars with common words like: &quot;Ughh, she got blue eyes and long light-rose hair in h-game, that&#039;s all..Lets draw her now..&quot; or artists, who were trying to etch drawings with an empty ink-pen. Animation isn&#039;t great too, mostly action and conversations look like a puppet theatre, but sometimes progress is trying to break through this curtains of sadness.<br />
By the way the characters are absolutely plain. No catch phrases, no original facial characteristics...nothing special. It seems that seiyu also didn&#039;t try their best, they just did what they were paid and told.<br />
Sound is quite nice, all the nature sounds are kept well. Honestly, music is not my cup of tea, but I enjoyed ending (can&#039;t say it is awesome, but the melody is catchy).<br />
To conclude everything above, &quot;Lamune&quot; is suitable for genre fans only – that&#039;s the uncontested truth.

    Quick Review<br />
Story: 8 - Nice, simple and Sweet, I didnt feel it was too slow<br />
Art: 8 - Compliments the drowsy (not sleepy) atmosphere<br />
Sound: 7 - Standard in my opinion<br />
Enjoyment: 9 - Read below if you care...<br />
<br />
This anime is what I would call under-rated. This, however, is not without justification. The characters are fairly standard, art work doesn&#039;t blow you away, sound is good but also fairly standard, and the story is not ground breaking. Then why, you might ask, did I give this standard anime an 8. I would respond to this question in good snobby-douchebag fashion by saying &quot;Its beauty is in its simplicity&quot;.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review93705">
        A lot of anime today is busy, lots of things happen lots of emotionally painful drama (the writers hope) and to some extent that&#039;s good since we would all get bored otherwise. HOWEVER, if you find yourself tired of all those facepalms you do when a idiot protag. falls on a girl and sits there for an inordinate amount of time (long enough to cause misunderstandings when a girl walks in), this is the perfect anime for you. The two main characters simply care about each other and love each other, nothing more, nothing less. There is no love triangle (or square or pentagon or hexagon), teen angst, or other nonsense. I personally found it refreshing after a string of tool protags and angsty animes and I would highly recommend you either watch this anime now if you&#039;re tired of the angst or put it on your hold list until you are.<br />
Thanks for those of you who read though to the end.

    This is the epitome of cheezy anime. I&#039;m not kidding. It&#039;s so friggin&#039; cheezy that I considered dropping it. But I still finished it because during its time, this was perhaps a new thing.<br />
<br />
before I begin, let me just reveal that the title &quot;Lamune&quot; would not make sense in the earlier episodes nor should it have been considered the title because it hardly had anything to do with Lamune. <br />
<br />
For the plot, like I said, it was cheezy. It was your typical slice of life romance set in a rural area. Other than that, it didn&#039;t have much to offer. It&#039;s pretty much like watching

          <span style="display: none;" id="review234504">
        a biography of two lovers. It didn&#039;t stand out much.<br />
<br />
Speaking of not standing out, let&#039;s talk about the characters. While I liked the personality of the main character, his appearance did not match it at all. It would have been fine if he had spiky hair to go along with his trickster personality. But no, they just had to make him look like your typical light novel protagonist.<br />
<br />
And the worst out of all of them: the art. You can literally find better animation in a hentai. Now I&#039;m not saying the animation wasn&#039;t good, but even during 2005, there were series that had better art style. Maybe they didn&#039;t have the budget, but the truth still stands.<br />
<br />
Negative criticism aside, I suppose it did well with the BGM. It truly felt like I was in a provincial setting. Even the setting itself was well made. If there&#039;s one good thing about this series, it&#039;s the accurate representation of rural life.<br />
<br />
Did I enjoy it? Not really. But if you&#039;re a hardcore slice of life fan, then you might. But I&#039;m just gonna throw this out: nothing is exaggerated in this anime.

    Lamune is an anime slice of life ahead of its time, with a simple but very beautiful story. The story shows the friendship of Nanami with Kenji (which they have since children) that on the end of the Summer is becoming something more, along with the occurrences of these two during a certain time.<br />
<br />
Graphically it is acceptable considering the time from where it comes. The soundtrack is regular, a typical opening of a slice of life and a really bad ending for my taste.<br />
<br />
The characters are the ones that always appear for a Slice of Life, Nanami is the sweet and somewhat awkward Waifu girl

          <span style="display: none;" id="review240002">
        and Kenji is the one who wins all the anime girls besides the family and her best friend.<br />
<br />
What I liked a lot was that twist that gives the story about the two final chapters, I really did not expect something like that, giving way to a happy ending for both protagonists.<br />
<br />
As someone who likes slice of life enough if I enjoy it enough, I would recommend it if you are looking for a slow and quiet story as this slice of life of romance is.

    We all have a niche anime which fanbase is so small, it seems like essentially nobody&#039;s heard of it. Although it might be unknown and might not be perfect, there&#039;s still a passion for it. Today, I will be reviewing the niche anime I’m passionate about and hopefully, this anime will get more reception. This anime is the fall 2005 romance series Lamune, which is assumed to have only around thirty thousand viewers. Throughout this video, I will be talking about how good this anime is and if you should watch it too. I will try my best to keep it spoiler-free with an exception

          <span style="display: none;" id="review383121">
        of a spoiler segment which will have a warning before it occurs. <br />
<br />
To begin, let&#039;s shed a little light on the history of Lamune so you could get to know it a little bit better. Lamune was originally derived from the Japanese beverage Ramune, which is essentially just a carbonated drink. Lamune was first released as a Japanese adult visual novel for the PC on July 30, 2004, by Neko Neko Soft. It would later get ported to the Playstation 2 on August 25, 2005, as a much more family-friendly version. On October 11, 2005, the visual novel was adapted by Trinet Entertainment and Picture Magic to a twelve-episode anime series. Other notable anime these studios produced was Final Approach in 2004 and Penguin Musume Heart in 2008. Interestingly enough, it wasn’t until after the anime was finished airing that its respecting manga and the light novel were released. The manga was released on January 26, 2006, while the light novel was released on February 1, 2006. Both the manga and the light novel would only have one volume and would be published by completely different companies. Overall, the lamune series received horrible feedback as barely anyone watched it and scored 6.83 out of ten on My anime list. You’ll find out soon enough if this anime deserved that score.<br />
<br />
As for the characters of Lamune, it actually has a fairly small cast. Lamunes main cast features Nanami Konoe, Kenji Tomosaka, Suzuka Tomosaka, Hitari Nakazato, and  Hiromi Sakura. Kenji Tomosaka is our generic protagonist of the series, he is a mechanic and helps out the Konoe Families local restaurant. Nanami Konoe is the main love interest of the series, she is Kenji’s childhood friend and works at a local farm for her family&#039;s restaurant. You can probably guess by the name, but Suzuka Tomosaka is Kenji’s little sister. She&#039;s always seen by her brothers side and helps keep their unstable family together. Hitari Nakazato is Kenji’s popular cousin. She is mostly there to cause trouble and try to get Kenji and Nanami closer. Finally, Hiromi Sakura is the romance rival of the series, but I won’t say how her arc ends.<br />
<br />
As I usually do, I combined the music and animation into one section since it&#039;s the least I have to talk about. Beginning with the animation of lamune, I’d say it seems like Trinet Animation took more of a lead on the art or style of Lamune. Lamune has that classic anime look to it, the kind you would expect a retro slice of life anime to look like. For the early 2000 era of anime, I’d say its animation was midrange, it wasn’t the worst for its time, but it also certainly wasn’t the best. The character designs were really nice, but in my opinion, the color was lacking, although the source material is a little hard to find, I’m going to remain hopeful that the designs were faithful to its source material. As for the music of this anime, Lamune Features the opening “Lamune-iro no Melody” by Mayu and the ending “Summer Vacation” by Ayumi Murata. These artists are seemingly unknown and difficult to figure out what other music they wrote, but I’d say their performance for Lamune was okay. The opening by Mayu was a good wholesome opening and the Ending by Ayumi Murata was mediocre. As for the OST of the anime, I’d say it&#039;s fairly generic and nothing really to write home about. All in all, I would say that Lamune had fairly good animation with some mediocre music to go alongside it.<br />
<br />
Story (spoilerless)<br />
Lamune was a romance story about a small country-side town. Lamunes&#039; story seemed to have a heavy reliance on flashbacks at the beginning of the episode, which would somehow find a way to incorporate itself with whatever occurs within the episode, which in some circumstances felt kind of forced. These flashbacks also served to strengthen the relationships between the characters and helped to explain why some characters act the way they do. The story does have a fairly slow start but picks up in the second half whilst also getting fairly interesting near the end. Although Lamune aired for one season and received only 12 episodes, I’d say the story does feel complete, the writers completed all the plotlines introduced in the series and gave the fans essentially everything they would want in a romance anime.<br />
<br />
Story(Spoilers)<br />
Alright so for those who are still here, let&#039;s talk about the story of lamune, more specifically, the second half of the series. In the second half of the series, the typhoon episode was introduced. This episode showed us how much Nanami relied on Kenji, but also the lengths Kenji would go through for Nanami&#039;s safety. This was a strong episode and I personally really liked it. The result of this episode ended up with Nanami in the hospital though. A little time later when it was time for Nanami to be discharged from the hospital, Kenji got into that car accident, causing him to fall into a coma. Although I felt this episode was powerful and emotional, I also felt like this was rushed as Nanami was literally just in the hospital. Even with these trailing arcs, the anime still managed to have a strong ending where Nanami and Kenji begin dating, something most anime fail to do these days. <br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
Although Lamune has a mysterious source material, which is fairly unknown to me, I’d say the writers did a fairly good job at piecing together the story and making something that had a fairly satisfying ending. As mentioned in the animation segment, I was a fan of the character designs, but the colors of the anime were lacking. Although its soundtrack was mediocre, I would say that it&#039;s wholesome opening really fit the vibe the anime was going and really fit the country atmosphere the anime had. All things considered, I decided to give Lamune a. seven out of ten! Although I am passionate about Lamune, I just can’t say it&#039;s perfect. The anime has many obvious flaws, but I wouldn’t say it compromises the enjoyment of the watch. So, considering it got 6.88 out of ten on my anime list, I would say that score was fairly deserved, even though I believe it could do with a couple of decimal boosts, but nonetheless, I would recommend Lamune if you are a fan of retro romance anime or just a romance fan in general.<br />

    Lamune is your typical warm romance that follows the adventures of Kenji and Nanami.<br />
<br />
And yes, if you were thinking the title sounded similar to &quot;lemonade&quot; in your head, then you are correct, as it is indeed transliterated from the English word itself. The actual Japanese word is &quot;ramune&quot; which is a popular soft drink there, but they replaced the first letter to make the anime sound more unique. The drink, however, does play a role in the anime to symbolize bonds and you will find out what I mean by that when you watch it yourself.<br />
<br />
One thing you will notice right away in Lamune is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247188">
        that the dialogue is pretty direct. Unlike most anime where the male character is normally a wimp and the girl is bitchy, both of the two lovers in this anime are very, well, lovable! And the dialogue itself tackles a lot of modern anime standards because of this, so if you are looking for an anime that is a breath of fresh air, look no further.<br />
<br />
Kenji has a personality that is more rowdy than your typical male lead, which is something that was a more standard practice in nineties anime than it is in thousands, so it is an unusual surprise to see it in Lamune, considering the time it aired.<br />
<br />
Nanami is actually the one that is wimpy in contrast to Kenji, which is something you would not expect to see in your usual romance. She usually allows Kenji to do the hard work and she is very gentle to her surroundings herself. A very lovable lead female character indeed and not one that you will soon forget because of these traits.<br />
<br />
The rest of the characters, however, follow your typical stereotypes. As per the usual standard in your romance anime, expect the male lead&#039;s sister to look the hottest out of all the other females. Though, I personally did not think so myself, the anime blatantly makes it obvious that everyone is jealous of her.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, though, you have the actual bitchy female character, though she falls under the sense of conjuring obnoxious plights wherever she treads. And indeed, she will annoy you a bit, but she will not make you hate the anime.<br />
<br />
I could go on a little more, but the anime does have a fruitful cast overall, so there&#039;s no sense in spoiling all of them. And speaking of, as you may be thinking, will twelve episodes be enough to flesh them all out? Surprisingly, yes. When you watch this anime, there is not really a time where you will feel that there is a character that has something unresolved about them. And that is why I personally enjoyed this one a lot.<br />
<br />
It is funny, though, considering the source material is from that of a video game, where they normally rush things the most since it is your usual case of trying to juggle all of the female characters&#039; plots all at once. But, I never felt like that was the case and did not even know it originated from a video game until I wrote this review.<br />
<br />
Overall, I like Lamune a lot because it gives me a loving story, warm characters and calm atmosphere. The environment is also very soothing to look at and it really gives me a homey feel that I have not experienced in an anime in a very long time. Despite its rather small setting, I grew to love this one a lot. I was rather sad that it was not available for purchase, because it would have been a nice addition to my collection. At least I found a poster of it, so I will definitely not forget about it.<br />
<br />
If you enjoy warm romances and want something that is much more fresh than all the others out there, give Lamune a go. You will be very happy that you did.

    I first started this series due to the voice actress for Nanami. She generally does really cute characters from what I have noticed and this series was no different.<br />
<br />
If the word moe-blob can be used for any one person&#039;s voice Yuko Goto&#039;s voice would be it, however the story itself is a sweet high school romance with slice of life thrown in. The story is a bit cliche but sometimes that can be good when you just want a short and sweet story that, despite some ups and downs, ends well.<br />
<br />
In the end, I watched the series for one actress&#039; work, and ended up enjoying

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6846">
        the whole ride, I would recomend this series to those wishing for a generally positive romance.

    I showed interest in this anime thinking it&#039;ll be a lite slice-of-life anime. I was not disappointed. <br />
<br />
Plot: Every episode starts the same way, a flashback featuring the two main characters and how the events of the present relate to it. The pace of this show may not be the cup of tea for everyone, it moves rather slow -some may say nowhere - and the last couple of episodes may or may not give a case of tears. And you often see in other shows -mainly harem - a childhood friend, well this shows you the true childhood friends with their past experiences and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review134955">
        the such. <br />
<br />
Characters: The main characters of this show (Nanami and Kenji are rather likable, to me at least). The other support characters are fun to watch with their quirky personalities. <br />
<br />
Art: Nothing impressive to note, the background are rather plain as well, song the setting is a countryside that is a minus. <br />
<br />
Sound: I really felt the show was set in the countryside with the little sound effects in it such as the sound of the cicadas and the such, but as far as the score not the music to the ears. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I enjoyed this little slow-paced show because that was I wanted from the very beginning, the romance was lacking but I liked how it ended. I rate this 6.5/10.<br />

    Possibly one of the most typical plot lines you see in slice of life Romcoms is the Childhood friends becoming lovers. Although the story is overused and been done time and time again it&#039;s the build-up that matters and even though in Lamune some of it seemed a bit cliched, I still had a nice time watching this anime. <br />
<br />
Story: Yes, Yes I know it&#039;s been done. And i know you&#039;ve probably read the synopsis and thought to yourself, &quot;wow, I&#039;ve already seen about 1000 of those.&quot; Well, your probably right about that but don&#039;t let that be what deters you away from Lamune. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review78990">
        story is about 2 childhood friends who&#039;ve been through everything together. They&#039;ve lived their complete lives in the country right next door to each other. But, neither has ever tried to push the relationship any closer. In the series, your shown various flashbacks of memories they both share and although they&#039;ve gotten older the things they do haven&#039;t really changed much. But, the characters themselves have. <br />
<br />
Art: For a 2005 anime, I must say it wasn&#039;t terrible artwork. Obviously, it&#039;s not in the same league as some of the newer anime in 2012(SAO,Toradora etc.) but the characters look nice.<br />
<br />
Characters: I found the characters to be very likable even though at some points in the show the things they do seem a bit questionable. <br />
<br />
Overall: If your in the mood for a very lighthearted romance then this is definitely worth your time. Don&#039;t expect overly romantic scenes or a suprise confession. The love between them is slow but it&#039;s building and even if your not a fan of slow love stories, the ending will leave you with a big stupid grin on your face.
