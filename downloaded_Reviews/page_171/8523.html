    Hey there!<br />
<br />
So I just got done watching Brothers Conflict, the shoujo anime of the summer season 2013. So in Brothers Conflict we are following Ema Hinata, a young girl of 16 years old that decided to live with her 13 so called &#039;siblings&#039; and here is where the trouble begins.<br />
<br />
Story: 4/10 The story is very simple, it is a reverse harem it speaks for itself. Girl lives with brothers, all the brothers want a piece of her (or at least most of them). The sad thing is that each episode basically jumps from brother to brother, the main character Ema doesn&#039;t form a strong bond

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113285">
        with any of the brothers because of the continuesly jumping from one to the other yet most of the brothers all want a romanctic relationship with her while they barely know anything about our main character Ema. But I will delve into this further in the character section.<br />
<br />
The reason why I gave the story a 4/10 is because it is a very mainstream anime and not a lot happens, it is all centered around one question which is: who gets the girl? which is exactly the point of a reverse harem. The odd thing that bothers me is that  each time you see one of the brothers on screen with Ema they either hug her or kiss her or in the very least touch her and after all that happened she just carries on with her day like nothing of the sorts happened though she consiously knows how all of them feel about her but it just seems like she shrugs it off like it is an everyday thing. Although she proclaims to only want to be &#039;siblings&#039; with her brothers she gradually allows any of the guys to kiss her and do anything with her as they please. <br />
<br />
From episode 1 she knows that they aren&#039;t really her siblings since her dad married their mother so technically non of them are related by blood only they are legally a family on paper. Eventhough she knows this she still continues to call them her &#039;siblings&#039; which is disturbing since the fact that almost everyone of them want to have a romantic relationship with our main character Ema. Everytime she called them her siblings I found myself yelling at the screen &#039;You aren&#039;t siblings! realize that!&#039;<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10 the art is basically the save and grace for this anime, the animation is beautiful and fluent, the backgrounds are spendidly done and of course the originality of each character is beautifully portrait. Each one of the brothers are easy to recognize by either hair style/hair color and the color of their eyes. The only downside I have on the art is that the emotions aren&#039;t easily recognizable on their faces. Even when they are happy they are very mediocre about it.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10 the sound was very average in my opinion, each time the intro music and the outro music began to play I found myself skipping over it entirely since I didn&#039;t enjoy listening to them. The lyrics weren&#039;t the best either, the music is very upbeat and fast paced. Not that there is anything wrong with an upbeat song and I understand they needed to make a happy sounding opening/ending since it is a reverse harem and it is all about romance but I felt like it wasn&#039;t necessary. It wasn&#039;t bad so to say but it wasn&#039;t really enjoyable to me but that is just my personal opinion, each person has his or her own taste of music.<br />
<br />
Character: 3/10 The character development is very bad to say the least. Like I said before each episode focuses on one brother at a time and since we have 13 brothers in the house and our main character Ema, character development is very limited.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that Ema our lovely main character is as emotional as a brick wall. What is so appealing to her that almost every guy wants a romantic relationship with her? The only traits she has is that she is a nice and caring person and likes video games. That&#039;s it. Nothing more. <br />
<br />
The fact annoys me that the brothers barely spoke with her and immediatly they have a crush on her, with some of the brothers she has a better connection then with the others but eventhough despite this most of them want her, is it because she is good looking? Not particularly, she looks like  an average young girl. Is it because of her character then? No because her emotions are turned off 24/7. So what is it? It is because she is our main character and so that makes it automatically the person everyone desires.<br />
<br />
Because it has so many characters and only 12 episodes the character development was sadly nowhere to be found.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10 despite all the negative aspects of this anime I found it rather enjoyable. not because of the story writing or the characters but mostly because I had a good laugh out of it, every time one of the guys had an encounter with Ema that didn&#039;t make any sense at all I found myself at least given a chuckle about this whole affair.<br />
<br />
I might give a little spoiler here but in one of the scenes one of the brothers realized he wanted to grow more before he can be a good man to her and it was a very dramatic scene with sad music playing in the background and you know that this was one of those scenes that was meant to make your heart break but instead I found myself laughing on the floor because especially that brother had barely any interactions with her at all.<br />
<br />
So my overall score of this anime is a 5/10. If you are into the harem genre I would recommend it or either if you want to laugh at a romantic story that doesn&#039;t make any sense at all this is the anime for you! <br />
<br />
Hopefully this was helpful<br />

    Now, this is my first review ever and I feel I need to write it after seeing so many bad reviews about this anime.<br />
In fact, the only reason I watched this anime was because I was curious after I read all these negative reviews. I wanted to see just how bad it was, and I&#039;m glad I did. I went in with low expectations, and was pleasantly surprised. <br />
<br />
I will detail what I liked or didn&#039;t like about the anime, and will not focus on individual scores for story, characters, music etc. <br />
<br />
*spoilers*<br />
<br />
The things I didn&#039;t like/understand &gt;<br />
# The girl&#039;s character<br />
# Why everybody liked her.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review240138">
        There was nothing special about her<br />
# The squirrel (who also is in love with her)<br />
# Why such unbelievably hot guys would instantly fall for someone so average.<br />
# No romantic development - they just fall in love with her<br />
# The eldest two bros showed no romantic interest in her (the lawyer was once left red faced, but that story line wasn&#039;t pursued)<br />
# Why such a rich family has no servant<br />
<br />
The things I liked&gt;<br />
# Unlike what many reviews here state, the brothers did have character development, some more than the others.<br />
# Pleasantly surprised to see how well balanced these guys were - instead of fighting with each other over the girl, they gave her the option of choosing one of them. Very mature and very unexpected.<br />
# I really liked the 2 guys who were shown to genuinely (according to me) like her - the red head and the sports guy.<br />
# Every brother has a distinct personality<br />
# The brothers are smoking hot.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m sure there are more likes and dislikes, but only these come to mind now. It&#039;s a &quot;junk food&quot; type of anime where you watch it for the sake of watching it. I binge watched it in a day. Go in with low expectations and you&#039;ll be pleasantly surprised.<br />
<br />

    We all know that the internet has a lot of power nowadays. And it can raise a lot of awareness for all kinds of good causes, such as famine and natural disasters, but instead, the producers of this anime decided to use it for illustrating the dilemma that every young female has to face nowadays: with which of her 13 brothers does the main character want to start a romantic relationship? First world problems, right?<br />
<br />
~Story~ 1/10<br />
So I kind of explained the plot of this show in one sentence in my introduction. The series is about Ema Hinata, a 16-year old girl, who&#039;s actually been alone

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222671">
        all of her life (can you already see the clichés coming?), and I&#039;m excluding her stupid pet squirrel while making this statement. Basically, her life sucked until her father decided to marry a woman who has 13 (!) sons. And so Ema ends up with 13 new brothers, who are, of course, all deeply in love with her. I won&#039;t start about how unrealistic it is that a girl ends up with 13 brothers because of a remarriage, but what are the chances that ALL 13 OF THEM (including a toddler for God&#039;s sake) are in love with her? Every episode featured Ema with another brother, and it was all incredibly predictable and dull. Seriously, when I finished, it felt like I had watched around 50 episodes, and watching these 12 episodes (which felt like 50) felt like a chore. I&#039;m not going to dig deeper into the story, because this is all there is to it. I&#039;ll admit it, maybe I&#039;m just not the kind of person to enjoy reverse harems, but I can&#039;t imagine anyone else (apart from obsessive fictional bishounen-sensitive teens) enjoying this crap.<br />
[CONCLUSION]<br />
It&#039;s debatable whether there&#039;s really a story in this. The comedy was lousy, and not in place, sometimes even cringeworthy. The &quot;plot&quot; was unrealistic and seriously stupid. Who came up with this?<br />
<br />
~Art~ 5/10<br />
The art in this wasn&#039;t the worst I&#039;ve ever seen, but it definitely wasn&#039;t great. For some reason, every single dude in this looked like a chick, and there was even one brother that resembled a cat (yes, I&#039;m talking about the perverted one). It had some pretty colors (to attract horny nose-bleeding teens, probably), but don&#039;t fall for them, this anime is still a pile of shit. A colorful pile of shit, but still a pile of shit.<br />
[CONCLUSION]<br />
Colors everywhere, and males looked like females. It was so confusing that at one point, I couldn&#039;t even tell who was supposed to be a trap anymore.<br />
<br />
~Sound~ 4/10<br />
One word to describe the music in this: forgettable. The opening was a stereotypical reverse harem intro, so forgettable, I have no idea how it went anymore. The show probably had some OSTs, but umm yeah. Wait, I remember three things considering the sound in this. 1) The ending. I didn&#039;t know I was watching Uta no Prince-Sama? Nobody asked for those traumatizing ending visuals, but then again, nobody asked for this piece-of-shit-anime either... &quot;Kissu kissu, Ai need ur lavu&quot;... 2) The voice of that damned squirrel. At one point, I was just irritated beyond belief, to the point where I actually wanted to set my computer on fire, so that I could see that stupid rodent with its stupid voice finally burn. 3) The voice of that toddler..... Woah. You know how some things are called a match made in heaven? Yeah, the character and the voice of the toddler were the complete opposite of that. It was as if Jigsaw was trying to convince the viewers of his cuteness. Seriously, no toddler has a voice that low. <br />
[CONCLUSION]<br />
Most of this was below average, and the voice acting was rather bad.<br />
<br />
~Characters~ 1/10<br />
Well, this should be fun. I&#039;ll go over the characters a bit quick, since there are so many. I&#039;ll start with the main character, Ema. The wiki calls her the heroine of the story, but I don&#039;t think she&#039;s a heroine. She&#039;s just kind of there. She doesn&#039;t stand up for herself even once. Seriously, why is the girl in reverse harems always either an aggressive tsundere or a retarded, brainless zombie like Ema? There&#039;s nothing interesting to tell about her, so I&#039;ll move on to my favorite character: the squirrel. Just kidding, I hated him more than anyone. He was trying to &quot;protect&quot; our beloved main character from the brothers, which involved some serious stalking incidents. There was even a moment where us viewers were supposed to feel bad for that gnawer, because Ema didn&#039;t take it with her to school or something. Is that the definition of &quot;feels&quot; nowadays? Now, for our 13 Asahina brothers. The oldest son, Masaomi, the stereotypical caring guy, whose only life concern is his family. The second son, Ukyo, the stereotypical smart guy, who is basically the slave of the entire household. The third son, Kaname, who is a monk, but a very perverted one, and he hits on every girl he sees. Great monk. Seriously, does buddhism allow that kind of shit? The fourth son, Hikaru, is the trap of the family. The fifth and sixth sons, Tsubaki and Azusa, the twins who have the same two lifegoals; becoming anime voice actors and becoming Ema&#039;s boyfriend. The seventh son, Natsume, the only normal guy, who decided to leave the house and live on his own (and who could possibly blame him for that?). The eighth son, Louis, the stereotypical silent guy who wants to be a hairdresser or something. The ninth son, Subaru, the stereotypical sporty and awkward guy. The tenth son, Iori, who seems normal at first, but he has a strange obsession for flowers. The eleventh son, Yusuke, the stereotypical tryharding guy, who&#039;s failing at life. The twelfth son, Fuuto, who is 13 years old, yet looks like he&#039;s 18. Has some sadistic tendencies, even though he&#039;s just a spoiled 13-year old. He&#039;s kind of like the Joffrey Baratheon of Brothers Conflict. And last but definitely not least, the thirteenth son, Wataru, the toddler with the godzilla voice. I don&#039;t know about you, but I love this cast.<br />
[CONCLUSION]<br />
The cast consisted of stereotypes and the characters got no development at all.<br />
<br />
~Enjoyment~ 2/10<br />
Well, this is very subjective. After watching this (which I do not recommend you) you might end up laughing at the stupidity of this, or you might be crying because of your loss of faith in humanity. One thing that&#039;s for sure though, is that you&#039;ll be incredibly frustrated by the main character, who could have been replaced by a doll and no one would have noticed a thing. The final episode of this show is absolute and utter bullshit and will make you question why you watched it (even though you already did that whilst watching the series itself). Oh, and your eyes will probably bleed because of the ending.<br />
[CONCLUSION]<br />
The second hand embarrassment in the comedy of this was huge, the show wasn&#039;t funny and all in all just very boring.<br />
<br />
I have only one more thing to say: spare yourself. Spare yourself from this so-called Brothers Conflict, which I experienced as a conflict with my inner self, debating about whether I should drop the shit or not. And that repeated itself after every episode. I definitely made the wrong choice finishing it, it&#039;s not worth your precious time. Peace.

    I don&#039;t know what I was thinking when I decided to watch this anime. But I do know  watching this anime was a complete struggle. <br />
Story: The storyline is fairly simple: dad remarries, daughter moves in with &#039;brothers&#039;-they certainly don&#039;t act like brothers-and &#039;shenanigans&#039; ensue. Predictable and incredibly dull. Although this anime is only twelve episodes long, it felt longer and it was a chore for me to watch. I can&#039;t even remember how it ended. 1/10<br />
Art: I am just going to cut to the chase and say that I didn&#039;t like the art. While it is more appealing than the actual story, that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review154433">
        doesn&#039;t really say a lot. The art is boring for lack of a better word. 3/10<br />
Sound: I despised the opening...it was tedious in every way possible. I don&#039;t have any words to describe how bad it is. 2/10<br />
Characters: Oh boy, on a scale of 1 to Haruka from Uta no Prince-sama on the irritating metre, the female protagonist is about as annoying and spineless as Haruka is. She barely reacted when her so-called brothers were being perverted and hitting on her. I  hoped that she would stand up for herself and tell them to back off. The vast majority of the characters fade into the background. 1/10<br />
Enjoyment: Needless to say I didn&#039;t like this anime. At all. It was pure torture. 2/10

    Brothers Conflict was a breath of fresh air for me. Sure, it&#039;s a reverse harem, but it is one that isn&#039;t too flamboyant and with a myriad of personalities, this is a show that I could easily re-watch again and again. This show is not for all, but from what I&#039;ve stated from another review, I am weak at heart when it comes to this type of genre. ;)<br />
<br />
Story: So the protagonist, Ema Hinata, is put into a predicament in where she has to move in with 13 step-brothers. Yes, 13 of them. Her father is re-marrying and here is a girl who has lived

          <span style="display: none;" id="review123121">
        most of her life alone, so the result is that she has had a lack of physical and social contact with her father. Now, you throw her into the mix and boy oh boy is she in for some surprising events. Sure the plot isn&#039;t too creative, but it&#039;s nice to see that the female is self-sufficient and not such a damsel in distress like in other shows I&#039;ve seen. <br />
<br />
Art: The animation style is nice, though not mind-blowing. It&#039;s nice to see the different character designs of each of the men and the one younger brother. Some wardrobe and fashion designs were thought out and sometimes it&#039;s nice to see a new hairstyle or a charming outfit on the characters you are viewing.<br />
<br />
Sound: The show doesn&#039;t offer anything memorable in terms of music. Yes, even with one of the characters being an idol, I don&#039;t think the show really focused much of his particular songs. I would say  The OP theme is probably the only thing that stuck out for me, which is sung by Nobuhiko Okamoto! That aside, we have a range of voice actors, all of which are very talented and that bit of fan-girl in me just goes *toki-toki* with various discourse that is portrayed throughout the series. <br />
<br />
Character: For a 12-episode show, it&#039;s fair that they included all personalities and different perspectives of the males with how they view their beloved imouto (sister). Of course, don&#039;t expect to see flushed-out character development. Our female protagonist is a typical teen going through her goals and life choices; she&#039;s looking to graduate high school, but during the series, there are qualities in her that are quite passive. If she had a touch of spunk or another trait that made her more dynamic, I think I would have rated the character category a bit higher. Oh and let&#039;s not forget, Ema has a talking pet squirrel with whom she is able to communicate, which is a cute bonus. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment and Overall Conclusion: This show is worth re-watching again. Though it&#039;s not my top choices of a reverse harem show, it&#039;s light and rather short, still leaving room for hope and a sense of mystery about various possibilities that could happen in the future. ;) <br />
<br />
Pros - A shoujo, reverse harem that isn&#039;t flamboyant and provides opportunities for viewers to see many personalities of the male characters<br />
Cons -  Protagonist&#039;s qualities in some instances (imo), short series and lack of plot creativity.

    Obviously, this show&#039;s not for those who look for a story to follow. So if you&#039;re here complaining about the storyline and shallow characters I wonder why you even watched the show in the first place. <br />
<br />
This series is literally intended for a bunch of hormonal teenage girls, and it does a great job in being that kind of show. As a  hormonal teenage girl myself I can tell you that as long as you turn off your brain, these kinds of anime can be highly enjoyable. (or a hormonal teenage boy idk luv is luv amirite)<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not even going into detail about this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204095">
        show&#039;s flaws because there are too many to name and I also think we can all imagine them, especially if you&#039;ve watched reversed harem before. To sum it up - masochistic heroine, twincest, &quot;you worked hard&quot;, talking animal friends ft. &quot;wait....that&#039;s supposed to be a guy?!&quot;<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re forever alone like me and you need something to replace the void in your cold empty heart, I recommend this show. Thank you for your time, it&#039;s been great.

<br />
Ok, so without further adieu, I hereby make my presnt my ratings for each category of this 12 episode anime, which at first it was 13, eh who cares?<br />
<br />
So my ratings:<br />
<br />
Story and character-fair 6.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Basically this is a reverse harem at its simplest and every plot  revolves around Ema who is caught in a conflict with the  Asahina Brothers who are vying for her affection. Despite of its title &quot;Brother Conflict&quot; only a handful are  in competition

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113311">
        for the girl&#039;s heart, I gave it such score because there some episodes that I really don&#039;t like and there are episodes that were really touching.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
I gonna classify each characters in this anime in the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
No Contest: Masaomi, Ukyo, Hikaru, Iori and Wataru.<br />
<br />
Under this category, the mentioned brother were never seen actually competing for Ema&#039;s affection in fact the anime itself never gave these character&#039;s such opportunity to show their romantic intention for Ema. Masaomi is more like the father figure, Ukyo was more of the mother figure since he does the cooking and cleaning before Ema&#039;s arrival, Hkaru is gay and even if he did mention that he&#039;s gonna get in the fray it don&#039;t look like he&#039;s serious due to the fact that he&#039;s a novelist who needs ideas for his literary works, Iori on the other hand have very limited roles and Wataru ? Well, he&#039;s still a kid dress as a girl that I&#039;ll never understand why this anime&#039;s illustrator drew him that way.<br />
<br />
Predators: Kaname, Futo and Tsubaki<br />
<br />
Here, pretty obvious these brother have exhibited a certain aggressiveness towards Ema, it started with Kaname whom it wasn&#039;t clear if he&#039;s a monk or a club host you might say he&#039;s one of the reason why I gave this category  such score, Futo is one character that I would like to kick his balls and Tsubaki, I&#039;d probably wanna slit his throat, I placed them in this category co&#039;z these are the characters that I love to hate.<br />
<br />
Nice guys: Azusa, Natsume, Subaru and Yusuke<br />
<br />
These, for me, are the guys that I like to be Ema&#039;s love interest, though thery&#039;re gentlemen, it wasn&#039;t enough for me to give this anime a score higher than 6. Personally, if can have it my way I would prefer a Yusuke X Ema arc, since those two go nicely.<br />
<br />
Friend zone: Louis and Juli<br />
<br />
Pretty obvious that Louis and Ema share the same situation were they&#039;re both adopted and can speak to Juli (CHIIIIIIII), but Juli is quite annoying and you might say he&#039;s another reason why this anime&#039;s category deserves  a 6.<br />
<br />
The prize: Ema<br />
<br />
basically she the center of the whole &quot;Brother&#039;s Conflict,&quot; I like heer sweet and kind characteristics, but there are time that her being passive is quite annoying.     <br />
<br />
Art- mediocre 5.<br />
<br />
I just really have no comment about this anime&#039;s art designed.<br />
<br />
Sound, enjoyment and overall- good 7.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
I like both the opening and closing theme.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
Since this anime and the manga was taken out from a otome game, it wasn&#039;t surprising that such enjoyment was like a game itself, except it was studio Brain Base who is playing it.<br />
<br />
Overall: <br />
<br />
This anime is good enough to be enjoyed, though there are some situation that we wish as to whom the female character should be with, I think that it&#039;s enough that such anime with a harem genre should end that way it is. overall this anime is good, CHIIIIIIII!!!!!<br />
<br />

    Brothers Conflict is an anime that in my opinion, never stood a chance beyond episode three. It follows the main character Ema Hinata, who we only ever really know as Chi. I didn&#039;t actually discover her real name until the very last episode. And even then, i never once thought, &#039;what actually is the name of this girl?&#039; Nope i guess i was too busy trying to survive what has been one of the most disappointing animes of my life. What might have been exciting to reverse harem lovers, turns out to be...<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
....A story thats shallow and unrealistic.<br />
So what this story is trying to make

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113463">
        us believe is that a seventeen/eighteen year old girl was able to seduce 13 boys regarded as her brothers all by sitting there and looking &quot;cute&quot;. Though throughout this anime my opinion of cute and annoying have been dramatically redefined. Chi/Ema offers nothing to the story, she rarely does anything to actually seduce these boys and does nothing when they start falling at her feet. What we experience throughout this anime is the progression of love, awaiting the response to the many confessions this girl receives. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
....Art that has nothing to say for itself. <br />
The art was just your typical modern day anime art. Mainstream and unremarkable. Good quality yes but engaging or interesting, no.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
....Music that that will make you cringe. <br />
I have never rated sound badly in an anime before. Before writing this i had no idea what it actually meant to have bad sound, i mean what could be wrong with it? This anime however has shown me. If you actually attempt to watch this anime you will be plagued by a series of cheesy renditions afforded by one of Chi&#039;s superstar brothers, and if that wasn&#039;t enough, just to make sure you don&#039;t go away disappointed, at the end of every episode is a traumatising song in which all the brothers sing and dance. Never again do i ever want to experience what i went through here. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
....Characters that have no soul.<br />
You have the brothers. Some who like basketball. Some who like video games. One who is a superstar and another who is a transvestite. Just your typical everyday family. All of the brothers however, despite their likes and clothing preferences make the same cheesy moves on the main character Chi and then expect us to be surprised when the grab her by the arm and pull her against them for a dramatic and passionate...hug? Yeah, that all your really gonna get. A lot of hugging and not much else. The main character Chi or Ema is the most disappointing. This girl has no depth to her on any level. What we see of her is a boring girl who rarely makes a sound other than the occasional gasp when one of her brothers makes a move on her. She never objects to any of the things her brothers do but would rather stand there like a deer in headlights without any input what so ever. Yep she has been one of the most annoying characters of a the many shows i have seen, a conclusion i largely put down to her defenceless persona and stupid disposition.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
This anime doesn&#039;t really amount to anything. Its got an unrealistic story that never evolves, run of the mill art, traumatising music renditions, characters with no depth or personality and an ending which renders all of these events pointless. <br />
But by all means go ahead and watch this anime, it not so much terrible and as a big lump of boring that never improves or evolves.

    Brothers Conflict is one of the very few watchable reverse harems in the world of anime, but that&#039;s just it. &#039;s not good, or bad, it&#039;s just, &quot;watchable.&quot; and unfortunately it can be addicting to weak watchers, like me. <br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
<br />
I&#039;m sorry, but the plot is way too outrageous to take seriously. I mean, really? A girl who isn&#039;t all that special looking moves into her brothers&#039; home with NO PARENT SUPERVISION, and they all end up falling in love with her, and she just shakes them all off like they&#039;re a bunch of fucking cats. That&#039;s too perfect. I know its just an anime,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113741">
        but that&#039;s not how life works. It actually made me kind of angry. Though, some elements, like the fluffiness of the cute scenes/exchanges with my personal favorite brothers. (Yuusuke, Natsume, Azusa, but I&#039;ll get into that later...) I really liked that. SOME of them respected her and that led to a lot of cute scenes. <br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
<br />
The art isn&#039;t anything to giggle otokully (wtf Hattie?) at. It&#039;s obviously not as good as Death Note and Shingeki no Kyojin, but whatever. I mean, I didn&#039;t like the design of the protagonist, Ema. She looked ditzy and dumb. (Again, more on that later) But some character designs were pretty creative, even though they looked like ripoffs of other characters of other anime. Some their designs totally pissed me off. Whatever, it wasn&#039;t that bad, really...<br />
<br />
Sound: 6 <br />

My sister was obsessed with the ending song for some gay reason. She would sing it nonstop when we got home from school, and I would yell, &quot;What the fuck is that?!&quot; And she&#039;d yell back. &quot;It&#039;s the Brothers Conflict ending!&quot; I&#039;m not one to watch endings, but since she mentioned it, I took the time to watch it that day, and I guess the ending&#039;s pretty creative relatively. I mean, you got all these Brothers, why not use them for a choreographed dance number in which they all sing, even though some of them really shouldn&#039;t. (Subaru, when he sings, sounds like a dying cat.) It was okay. The opening was so annoying though!<br />
<br />
Character: 5<br />
<br />
Okay, there are 13 Brothers and one annoying protagonist. Its kind of given that I would hate all of them except a legitimate few. They all ended up falling in love with her, in which I scream,&quot;BOLLLOOCCKSSS!&quot; But some characters are worth mentioning. I mean, the only one that didn&#039;t force himself upon the protagonist was Yuusuke, that red haired bastard. Their exchanges were so sweet, along with Azusa&#039;s and Natsume&#039;s. I&#039;m just saying, they weren&#039;t overwhelming, and seemed fair to her, giving her a chance to breathe! While there are characters I like, I pretty much hate the rest of them and their designs. A perverted monk is basically a contradiction in it&#039;s own name, really. Is that the best of your creativity? And that pop star! Fuuto! I spit at his name! He&#039;s 15, my age, and attempting rape! Modern society, people. Is that normal in Japan? Also, I hated his design. Whenever he came on screen, I&#039;d yell, &quot;FUCKING NEKO-CHAN!!&quot; Cause face it, he looks like a cat and needs mouth surgery. There are too many hateable characters! That&#039;s a harem&#039;s nightmare! <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
As I said, it was my guilty pleasure. I watched it to the end, sadly. I didn&#039;t mean to, it just happened...<br />
<br />
Overall: 6.5<br />
<br />

    Okay, so despite all the negative reviews, I absolutely fell IN LOVE with this anime. i was just searching for something to watch, but after the first episode, I just wanted to keep going. The brothers all have pretty different personalities, and in each episode, the girl has a &quot;special moment&quot; with some characters. <br />
Story (7/10): Like most other reviews have mentioned, it is just a typical reverse harem anime, but story was very well written.<br />
Art (8/10): This art was overall really good! It&#039;s nothing too fancy, but it&#039;s a lot better than most animes.<br />
Sound (6/10): I didn&#039;t like the intro or outro song a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178936">
        lot. The tune was kinda hideous and it was not catchy. The lyrics were okay, but the voices for the songs were terrible.<br />
Character (9/10): Okay, so this is all based on personal opinion. As I said, different boys get their time with Ema. The development, although kind of slow, was pretty entertaining. <br />
Enjoyment (10/10): As I&#039;ve mentioned, I was hooked on the first episode! Each episode, it wanted to make me continue watching!  Most of the characters were pretty hot and despite their outside appearance, their inner personality is quite adorable. ^-^<br />
Overall (9/10): This reverse harem anime is mostly directed towards girls. The way I see it, just put yourself in the position of Ema, the main character, and it&#039;s basically like a choose your prince games. If you need to get something or someone off your mind, this is a great piece to watch.

    This show was... weird<br />
<br />
This really isn&#039;t for someone who&#039;s looking for a good story, it&#039;s just kinda boring and at times confusing. I think too many things go unexplained mainly with the Squirrel Juli and why he can talk to the main character Ema and one of the brothers Louis/ not to mention a weird dream sequence Ema has with a human Juli towards the end of the show? Speaking of Ema her character was really boring and has essentially no personality for herself like I understand that it&#039;s a reverse harem aimed at teens so they&#039;re supposed to look at the Protagonist and see

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337533">
        themselves but it was downright frustrating to watch Ema interact with the other characters. I actually liked the brothers themselves (especially Ukyo and Hikaru) and kinda wish that some of them got more screen time (mainly Lori and Masaomi). The art wasn&#039;t my favourite but I don&#039;t think it was bad and I actually liked the opening.<br />
<br />
Overall, I couldn&#039;t really enjoy the show because of the boring story and dull protagonist.

    This anime does not know how to treat incest, it is also too toxic..I did not play the visual novel so I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s a bad adaptation, but what I saw was vomiting..<br />
<br />
Disclaimer:SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Story 2/10:<br />
<br />
The story is the typical harem of a girl with many handsome boys that does not develop at all, it is repetitive and monotonous.<br />
AHH AND IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS EVERYONE, EVERYONE WANTED TO F#CK THE GIRL.ALL OF THE BROTHERS OF THE GIRL.YOU ARE UNDERSTANDING THIS??,THIS IS COMPLETLY HORRIBLE.And for the worst there is a scene of abuse that is horrible, a scene from the school festival where one of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354574">
        the girl&#039;s brothers abuses her dressed as a vampire and leaves a mark on her neck, one is crazy if you want to consume this content so vomiting, on top of that the girl does not tell any of her more decent brothers or call the police. And the anime is like this, &quot;THE WOMAN WHO I ABUSE EVERY DAY DOES NOT WANT ME&quot; I don&#039;t understand why they let the reverse harem men as sexual predators.In this anime the brothers treat the protagonist as an ornament to touch and kiss, without the consent of the girl eh ?? ...<br />
<br />
Art and Animation 5/10:<br />
<br />
The animation is fine, but the art is ugly at times and very average that you can see in any anime.<br />
<br />
OST and Voice acting 5.6/10:<br />
<br />
The OST is very average and not at all memorable, the voice acting is good.<br />
<br />
OP and ED 6.1/10:<br />
<br />
The opening is good, it&#039;s catchy and I just like that the lyrics don&#039;t seem suitable for anime. The ending is average.<br />
<br />
Character 2.5/10:<br />
<br />
The characters are flat, they have hardly any personality, the situations are embarrassing, the scenes between characters feel forced, the protagonist does not defend herself, it is useless, and the boys are all horrible sexual predators who like the girl but most of them are toxic, the only ones I rescue are the squirrel and the hairdresser.Another redeemable character was the brother who was the protagonist&#039;s classmate, the redhead.<br />
The character that I hate was the idol, he&#039;s very toxic at all.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 5.2/10:<br />
<br />
The anime was vomiting for the most part, although there were somewhat entertaining scenes, for example those where the squirrel took care of the protagonist so that the boys would not abuse her, but afterwards it was all mediocre.<br />

    Well this anime earn my 2nd worst anime to watch. Reason the story start with a girl that live with 13 brother way older then her and wait the story lead to nothing and if I was the writer of the script I will be a shame to put a anime that have no development of the personage how so ever and to add the love that the brothers show the female lead personage is almost shameful. I just believe that should create a better story that to traumatize the girl in the show. Well to say that the show need better arts as the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review209312">
        Female lead she where 90% of the show the school uniform and useless character as Squirrel that is maybe 5% of the show. I do not recommend that show to been watch because even the script that is use make no scent how so ever. I do not recommend the waste of 13 episode to watch this show.

    **Warning: May Contain Spoilers**<br />
<br />
My friend and I decided to watch this series on a whim as we heard this was a &#039;meh&#039; show and honestly, I had no idea what to except other then reading the synopsis. By the time we finished it made me question: Who sat down and agreed this is a good idea for a reverse harem anime?<br />
<br />
Story: 3/10<br />
Story seems pretty simple enough. Innocent girl&#039;s father re-marries a fashion designer, who has thirteen sons from her previous marriage. Our main character moves in with her new step-brothers and lives with them for months, while each step-brother desperately trying to get her attention

          <span style="display: none;" id="review341862">
        and affection. When I read the synopsis of this anime it made me think &#039;This is literally just incest, with extra steps...and isn&#039;t illegal&#039;. Each brother lays out &quot;This is what I have to offer&quot; question. There was no end goal plot. Its just a very fan-service focused anime for young women.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 5/10<br />
When it comes to the artwork overall, it was nice. Character designs were pretty nice to look at, however when it comes to certain scenes, I found around one or two screenshots where it was drawn pretty badly. Like they forgot how long a human neck was or forgot what a side view of a face looks like.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10<br />
The opening and ending songs were pretty catchy, when the episode ended I would keep the opening and ending songs running, I will say that the opening is better than the ending. Soundtrack seemed okay throughout the show. I wouldn&#039;t say they are rememberable though.<br />
<br />
Character: 2/10<br />
I look forward to writing this part, out of the step-brothers in the show Subaru was the only one I found manageable to put up with. The rest of them however, either I wanted to legit punch in the face or just get a full-out restraining order over a fictional character. Two episodes in and they would just &#039;fall in love&#039; with her even though they just moved in. Which to me breaks the whole immersion of the &#039;story&#039;. <br />
<br />
Juli (Ema&#039;s squirrel) is probably the worst bloody &#039;protecter&#039; in the series as he either A) Legit gets tossed to the side and is forgotten about so that the step-brothers can take advantage of her.<br />
and B) Falls in love with Ema, which defeats his whole character of trying to protect her from the entire male household like, seriously? He might as well not be added as a character.  <br />
<br />
Fuuto just straight up pissed me off during the entire show, He was not &#039;cute&#039; or &#039;attractive&#039;. He would just harass and puts the MC in uncomfortable situations, it made me cringe so hard and don&#039;t get me started on why the heck they added a character like Wataru to this disgrace of a harem.<br />
<br />
I did not give this a one star rating as I have sadly seen worst reverse-harems characters, which I shall not name in this review. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3/10<br />
I felt like I was wasting my time with this show. The only enjoyment I got out of this show and just how dense the plot was and looking forward to the ending of each episode just so I can listen to the ending credits. <br />
<br />
Overall: 3/10<br />
I can see how people can enjoy this just for the soundtrack and visuals, but clearly this show wasn&#039;t for me. I would highly recommend not watching this show for the characters and the plot alone.

    I&#039;m a bit ashamed to admit that reverse harem is one of my guilty pleasures. This, however, was utter crap. I only watched half of the anime, but I don&#039;t think I need to watch any more. The ending is way too predictable, and I&#039;d like to spare my eyes from finishing the rest of that dreadful anime.<br />
<br />
The story (2/10):<br />
<br />
Not only did this anime have no proper plot, it was just crammed with clichés and obvious scenarios. Furthermore, it had nothing else that could compensate for the horrible storyline. There was no humor, action, excitement, nothing. This anime was bland and a complete waste of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review191012">
        time. I demand to have my hours back.<br />
<br />
The art (8/10):<br />
<br />
Just about the only thing that prevented me from giving this anime a 1 was the art. I&#039;ve seen better, of course, but I&#039;m not going to lie and say that the artwork was terrible. <br />
<br />
The sound (5/10): <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t have anything particularly bad to say about the voices/soundtrack, mainly because I don&#039;t remember how any of them went. I was most likely thinking about how horrible the anime was than paying attention to the soundtrack.<br />
<br />
The character (2/10):<br />
<br />
Okay, I can probably write an entire book describing how detestable and flawed these characters are, but I won&#039;t because I don&#039;t want to waste your or my time. <br />
<br />
Throughout the entire anime (or at least the half that I watched), I wondered if the female protagonist was a robot. I have never seen such a boring, voiceless character before. <br />
As for the brothers, no matter how hard I tried to identify them and remember their names, I couldn&#039;t. Aside from the color and style of their hair, there&#039;s nothing else that distinguishes any of the brothers. <br />
<br />
Overall (2/10):<br />
<br />
Did I enjoy this anime? Hell naw. Would I recommend this anime to anyone else? Have you been paying attention to my review? <br />
<br />
This anime was just as bad as Diabolik Lovers (anyone who&#039;s interested in reverse harem would most likely know about this one). I strongly advise you to not waste your time watching this anime... I mean, unless this kind of stuff floats your boat, of course. <br />
<br />
If you&#039;re planning on watching this anime, be WARNED: you WILL lose brain cells.

    Ok. Now where do I start?<br />
Brothers conflict was pretty much a reverse harem on steroids. Not only are there TOO MANY hot bishies, but there is also a stupid squirrel that can fucking talk. Oh lord. <br />
The main protagonist is a stupid, indecisive, thick headed girl. She couldn&#039;t even tell if the guy liked or should I say lusted after her. Another thing that bothered me was the lack of character development. It seemed as if all Ema had to do was breathe or blink and another step brother fell in love with her. The step brothers had no respect for her and did not

        hesitate to force themselves upon her. Honestly, I think I think I would have liked this anime so much better if it was a hentai.

    Brothers Conflict. An anime I heard alot about back in the day, extremly loved by shoujo fans, and one of the most loved from that year.<br />
Now in 2019 I have to say: what the actual f . <br />
<br />
Story(2)<br />
The story is pretty simple: <br />
<br />
-Main character shares a mansion with her 13 step brothers. All of them want to get into her pants. *incest alert*<br />
<br />
-We&#039;re given the &quot;what I have to offer&quot; from each brother<br />
<br />
-Typical shy, weak minded, &quot;not sure what to do&quot; female protagonist. Which is both annoying and overly done in many animes of this genre.<br />
<br />
-The squirrel. The fricking squirrel. <br />
<br />
Sound(2)<br />
Sound wise nothing impressive. Even

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315522">
        the opening was pretty mediocre.<br />
<br />
Art(3)<br />
Art the exact same. Nothing we haven&#039;t seen before. To be quite honest wasn&#039;t my cup of tea.<br />
<br />
Overal(2)<br />
Was pretty disappointing and a waist of time. Not only was seriously unconfortable to watch due to the obvious incest, but the female character was so horrible that was painful to continue the show.<br />
Not having a decent soundtrack, opening or ending and not even having an ok-ish art style made it even worst.<br />
<br />
<br />

    I love reverse harems and there are not enough of them.  Unfortunately, too many of them make the female protagonist unintelligent and/or in interesting. This girl had a 30-word vocabulary to express herself with. So many opportunities of witty, comedic and/or funny retorts/remarks were missed by the authors. Only the guys are smart in this one. That’s just plain frustrating because the storyline is fantastic. She does get smart at the end with her decisions, but too little too late. On another note, the dubbed voice of the female protagonist is lacking. She has the same inflection when happy, sad, nervous, etc. She’s already

        in bimbo mode in this story, so add the flat voice and you want to smack her. Nonetheless, watch it. It’s nice to find reverse harems. Let’s leave reviews about wanting smart girls and better plot development in them! Let the producers hear us!

    Let me state for the record that I am not a fan of incestuous themes in anything.  The only reason I kept watching once I realized what was going on is not because they were steps, but because the step sibling thing happened when all of the characters were 16/17 years of age or older except one and he didn&#039;t count.  <br />
<br />
Alright now that that&#039;s out the way...<br />
<br />
I&#039;m a fan of reverse harems.  I enjoyed the brothers.  They&#039;re personalities were well developed except for maybe Iori&#039;s, who I forgot existed..  The brothers were charming, humorous, and bishie from #1-12 (like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113497">
        I said borther 13 is a kid).  They ranged in ages, careers, but they eldest weren&#039;t that far from each other which allowed for clashes. <br />
<br />
The female character known mostly as Chi was a ditz.  As well as the brothers were written she was not.  What little development they had, she had none.  I was hoping she&#039;d get a slap, but it never happened.  I really couldn&#039;t tell why any of the brothers aside from the teens would fall her.  She had nothing to offer them. The most I could reason is that their mother was an absentee so having a female in the house just confused them completely.<br />
<br />
I would watch this for the brothers.  I truly enjoyed them and wouldn&#039;t mind seeing all them again as brothers minus the step-sister.

    Okay to start this review off I have to say I love the reverse harem genre but there are two types of protagonists that are in that genre and those are the independent MC and the helpless airhead MC and I am stating that the protagonist of this anime is absolutely DREADFUL. <br />
<br />
The characters in this anime are not half bad but not good either, I hate that the personalities of the characters are stuck to their persona like their whole life isn&#039;t based like that? At least have a little bit of character development where they change their attitude towards the MC slowly and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review342050">
        not fall in love in the first 2 episodes. <br />
<br />
At first I thought &quot;Woah, this anime is kinda irritating..why isn&#039;t the MC fixing any of their conflicts but instead acting like a moronic airhead that only cares when guys are fighting for her?&quot; then that was the first thought of me wanting to drop it which I did. I came back after a while and watched the full thing and let me tell you, I WISHED I DIDN&#039;T. This whole anime was pathetic, they could&#039;ve had more thought into the characters and made the MC at least a little more independent other than relying on her brothers 24/7.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly I have a few good points about this, I liked how they didn&#039;t have her younger brother fall inn love with her otherwise I would&#039;ve gave this a 1/10 and I must say some of the brothers are quite good looking **cough cough** Natsume **cough cough** but they really have to fix A LOT of things about this anime.<br />
<br />
My final score for this anime is 4/10, it was decent but they could&#039;ve done better.
