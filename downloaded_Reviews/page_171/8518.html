    Are you a lonely, boy-less teenage girl? Do you wish you could have many hot guys surrounded by you, astounded by you for no real reason? What about living in a world where you get to date and be submissive to no, not just one attractive male, but over FOUR of them in many different worlds? Does that sound like the dream life to you? Have no fear, &quot;Amnesia&quot; is just what you need to fulfill this!<br />
<br />
In case you don&#039;t get the vibe, this is pretty much a reverse harem used primarily for female wish-fulfillment. The story centers around our lead girl, erm, I guess

          <span style="display: none;" id="review89101">
        we just call her Heroine? Because her boyfriends that love her oh so dearly never bother to call her by her name? Yeah. Heroine finds herself awakening with no memories, and it&#039;s up to her and a spirit called Orion to collect her memories. She&#039;s also trapped in this sort of &quot;time loop.&quot; Basically, each time she dies, the date resets. By date I mean both the month and day and her current boyfriend.<br />
<br />
The story has two main issues: the pacing and the Heroine. The pacing moves by pretttty damn slowly, to the point where even when we hit episode nine, nearly nothing is known about the main plot or what exactly is going on. The story is supposedly about the Heroine collecting her memories, but uh.. that&#039;s probably the least she&#039;s done throughout the show. And that&#039;s saying a lot, because she hardly does ANYTHING.<br />
<br />
And here comes our other issue, the Heroine herself. This girl is so bland, so personality-less, and used as such a wish-fullfillment device that she doesn&#039;t even have a name. Isn&#039;t that awesome, girls? You don&#039;t even have to get depressed when hot guy #1 doesn&#039;t call out your name! It makes self-insertion much, much easier. Heroine is a story-dragger -- she provides little to no advancement to the plot herself and has to rely on everyone else to push her in any direction possible. Oh yeah, having amnesia ain&#039;t excuse for not having a personality. Fucking Nyuu from Elfen Lied had more of a personality then her, and she couldn&#039;t even dress herself. <br />
<br />
Speaking of Heroine&#039;s reliance, this also brings another issue: she&#039;s submissive. Too, too submissive. Almost all the guys do extremely improper things to her, like shoving her against a tree in the middle of the dark against her will or forcefully kissing her, getting too close to her, anything. And she just accepts all of this. She never sticks up for herself, and is even willing to stay with a man whom she pretty much knows will dump her when his time limit is up. Great example, right guys? The male characters ain&#039;t any better -- they&#039;re all pretty much just a bunch of hot dude&#039;s lusting after Heroine for their own fucked up reasons. Some want to play her, others want to lock her up in a cage. You know how it is.<br />
<br />
Oh uh, the positives? Well, the art is pretty crisp, as expected of Brain&#039;s Base. The eyes look downright gorgeous and the opening theme is pretty much eyecandy. The men are attractive, which is a key for these anime, and the backgrounds are well-created. Soundtrack is merely mediocre and unmemorable, though bonus points are awarded for such an awesome opening song. I&#039;m convinced to hear more of Nagi Yanagi&#039;s stuff. <br />
<br />
So, enjoyment? I&#039;m sorry, but I&#039;m not the type of person that gets wet from putting myself in the shoes of a nobody and letting all these hot guys date and rape me. If you&#039;re the type that&#039;s into that, then I&#039;m sure your enjoyment of this will be much, much higher then mine. <br />
<br />
Now I will ask you this again -- are you a lonely and angsty teenage girl? Do you dream of many a men surrounding you, kissing you, pinning you behind alley&#039;s, and drugging you? Do you want to live in this life? If so, then look no further, my dears. This anime is perfect for you. You got a bunch of hot guys that want your tits and a girl who&#039;s so bland that you can insert my chihuahua in it and it would probably make the story more interesting.<br />
<br />
If not, just don&#039;t watch this. There is literally nothing to be lost and nothing to gain, except time and knowledge on how not to write a shoujo. <br />

    EDIT2016: Please take into consideration that this was written 3 years ago and the things I&#039;ve written here are quite biased from an otome game fan side. It was meant to be taken as a defense to the reverse harem genre as a whole which was a lot less popular during the time I wrote this than it is now. I must mention that I changed a lot of opinions during the past three years, I&#039;ve started to want to give more objective opinions, even if sometimes, it&#039;s, of course, unavoidable to not be biased; that doesn&#039;t mean that I&#039;m discrediting this review. I am

          <span style="display: none;" id="review90865">
        still convinced that Amnesia is NOT the worst reverse anime and most definitely NOT bad, but take mostly the first part with a grain of salt. I&#039;m keeping this review up to note down my own personal growth. Have a nice day!<br />
<br />
======<br />
<br />
I&#039;m one of those people that gave a high rating to Amnesia. Why? some of you may ask. Simply because Amnesia is NOT.BAD. Not as bad as people tend to label it. First fact about Amnesia: it&#039;s an otome game (dating simulation for girls) adaption, people! Girls are finally getting more fanservice and smexy bishies! The focus on it it&#039;s quite new so nobody can and will invest that much into smexy bishie animes for girls as they do invest in smexy girls with big boobs animes for boys! But this did good even with the low capital!IT HAD A STORY! I&#039;ve seen adaptions that are really bad, with no story, no development, no anything and I recognize it, but Amnesia doesn&#039;t deserve a 2 or a 3. The setting is nice! The art is nice and quite original! The music is the best of the season! The characters are a bit sketchy and hard to get through but they&#039;re not stereotypes. The heroine is a dead fish with no emotion, yes. But still, the other factors make up for it. <br />
<br />
Story - 8<br />
With all the time traveling we got last year this comes right at the right time. The story started off with a lot of potential and continued holding on the suspense factor till the last episode. Why are you people complaining about it? Do you like plots where you know everything from the first minute of the first episode? I personally enjoyed making theories about what the hell is happening while drooling over some bishies and have my heart thump because of some sweet, cheesy lines I&#039;d never recognize I like in real life. The explanations we got in the last episode was quite well made and we slowly managed to connect everything piece by piece. The last regression clip to when the heroine first died was nicely made too. It would have been nicer if the heroine seemed more alive. <br />
<br />
Art - 7<br />
Am I the only one that remained astounded by the character design? I was sad the quality seemed to drop sometimes though, like there started to be too many closeups, the characters stopped moving that much and it all went static like in the last episodes and sometimes the guys seemed taller than how they usually are which made me make fun of them quite a lot. Example: Ukyo and the trees in the alleyway, Ikki in the hospital room, Ukyo when laying down. <br />
<br />
Sound - 9<br />
Great! just great! If i could i&#039;d buy the soundtrack. I&#039;m addicted to the ending and opening of this anime. The first time I actually abuse the replay button on my mp4 in a while. <br />
<br />
Character - 6<br />
They are not stereotypes. They start off as stereotypes but they&#039;re not and the most obvious example is Toma for very obvious reasons, obvious reasons that probably paralyzed you in your chair having an amused or surprised &quot;oh god&quot; expression on your face. The guys were all characterized pretty beautifully. The only problem is the heroine. And I once again complain about her. She has no will of her own, no actual impressions, average amount of feelings. If I could dress a doll as the heroine and replace her with the doll then you won&#039;t even notice the change. She just goes from &quot;eh&quot; to &quot;oh&quot; and then &quot;O-O&quot; and then &quot;staaaaaaare*. I hated how Orion was removed from almost all the anime. He could have made her a little bit more enjoyable. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 7<br />
counting how Amnesia was the only anime that managed to keep me waiting in anticipation each Monday for the raw version, then Yes I enjoyed it. <br />
<br />
Overall - 7<br />
It tried to follow the otome game as much as it could afford. I liked how all characters had their route animated. FINALLY. And all the jumping in time actually had sense so every fangirl had their love love scenes with their favorite guy and everybody&#039;s happy. Anyway, I&#039;d like to ask of those who read this review...please don&#039;t bash it too hard. Amnesia it&#039;s really misunderstood and underrated. Somebody that didn&#039;t play the game might find it harder to enjoy it as one that already played it. I also felt disappointed at some scenes, but overall, it is not a failure with no sense at all to deserve a rating from Bad to Horrible and Pathetic. Try looking at the bright parts of it too and not only at the few bad parts.

    Ugh. This show. I wanted to like it so hard. But I ended up wanting to break my tv around episode 3 instead. <br />
<br />
Story: The pilot episode pulled me in right away. Girl has amnesia due to an accident with a spirit named Orion and can&#039;t tell anyone, but has to learn about her past somehow. Several interesting things happen in the first episode. But it gets awful from there. <br />
<br />
I get that this is based on an input based otome or reverse harem game. But the main character is SO uninteresting, boring, and just plain dull! I can&#039;t figure out why the male characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review86981">
        are all so interested in her! She has a few responses to everything: (1) Staring in confusion (eyebrows up in concern), (2) Responding in a whispery &quot;hai&quot;, (3) Saying &quot;uh, I, uh...&quot; and just letting the silence stretch to fill time I guess, and (4) running away or rejection. She rarely asks questions about her situation and the only thing she does to try to improve her situation is writing in a journal. <br />
<br />
Art: Oh so ugly! If I were the &quot;heroine&quot; (and I say that sarcastically since it seems like she&#039;d just die if the boys weren&#039;t around to constantly save her from just about everything), I&#039;d reject them all just based on their fashion sense! <br />
Ikki: In purple and black. Wears not only a hairclip but makeup too. <br />
Shin: In red and black. Clothes are raggedy and tight AND mismatched. Has one red and one black thigh high, lace up boot. And apparently vampire bites on his chest.<br />
Toma: In yellow and black. Headbands. Really? And kind of a checkered, piratey skirt sash thing going on. <br />
Kent: In green and black. Dresses like he&#039;s cosplaying an emo Vash the Stampede. <br />
Then there&#039;s our main character: She wears these red and black plaid tights with a SEA FOAM GREEN dress, tunic thing. Ok, her hair is cute but they ruined that too (read on).<br />
<br />
Did I mention the weird style of coloring their eyes? I felt like between the wacky outfits and eyes that I was in some 70s trip. Either that or the creators were TRYING to get rid of some viewers through the shear ugliness of the design. <br />
<br />
One more thing on character design. The main char gets her hair chopped off so dramatically in the first episode that she passes out. Yet when she goes to lament her new style in the mirror it&#039;s completely the same. Given the time skipping, I thought this would have made a great way for her to keep track of where she was, what day it was, etc. But no. They gave a cop out and didn&#039;t change her design in the slightest. <br />
<br />
Characters: The main character (whose name we never learn) is just horrendous. I&#039;ve already talked about that. The male characters are extremely cliche. There&#039;s the emo bad boy, the overly intelligent and socially awkward one, the fun childhood friend, and the playa that all the girls love. <br />
<br />
The boys all carry the story. It&#039;s completely up to them. What kills me is that they all notice something is slightly different about the main char, but don&#039;t really care or do anything about it. If she was like that before the accident, wow. How the heck did she get so many guys (not to mention her gal pals) interested in her?<br />
<br />
Here is an exchange from episode 6: <br />
Girl: (Looks down, looks up in surprise as Ikki goes to stand in front of her.) <br />
Ikki: You&#039;re not staying over?<br />
Girl: (Looks surprised. You can tell because she gasps.) Um, I...Um... (silence drags)<br />
Ikki: It&#039;s all right. I&#039;m not hungry like the wolf. I can sleep on the floor. I wont&#039; do anything you don&#039;t want me to. It&#039;s up to you whether or not you believe me though. <br />
Girl: I, uh... (silence drags)<br />
Ikki: What&#039;s that face for? (at this point she&#039;s just staring at him, completely normal face for her)<br />
Girl: (Staring, silence drags)<br />
Ikki: (Staring) (Laughs) Oh come on, you don&#039;t have to look so frantic. <br />
<br />
WTF? When did she look frantic? These guys are completely carrying the story and imagining things that aren&#039;t happening. I find it hard to see this as an anime and not the game it was based on because the main char might as well not even be there. I&#039;m so frustrated with it. I&#039;ve just completed episode 8 and I&#039;m dropping it from here. First review I&#039;ve written without finishing a show but I really don&#039;t see it getting better. <br />
<br />
Please don&#039;t waste your time!

    First of all, if you have strong impressions for this show, then refrain from reading any further. It might save you some time as well as brain cells that may be lost when watching this show. Trust me, time is worth saving.<br />
<br />
Well, if I had my say, this series right here known as Amnesia is one anime that I have one HELL of a trouble following. It&#039;s not the part related to the story but rather the concept of the entire series. Even behind the scenes, Amnesia is what I see as a title that can easily be forgettable, just like an Amnesia. It&#039;s a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review90989">
        series that just doesn&#039;t click right and was not enjoyable for me. As a matter of fact, this series is like a beauty without expression. It&#039;s a presentation without the delivery. It&#039;s a story without intelligence. And to be honest, I didn&#039;t like it one damn bit.<br />
<br />
The series is based off a Japanese visual novel of the same named produced by Idea Factory. The game is considered of the otome genre and thus is targeted towards more of the female audience. As such, the series stars a main female protagonist as she encounters several hot guys that represents a different suit of a card deck. She becomes the center of attention with her bonds involving the other guys in several supposed routes/arcs that proceeds the story.<br />
<br />
So from the very first episode, viewers may ask themselves: What the hell is going on? <br />
<br />
I sure did because the story begins with the main character (named Heroine with no real definite name other than what&#039;s being addressed by) with no memories. She is about 19 years old and we know almost to none of her backgrounds from the get-go. Well, we do know a few things. She is apparently lost with no memories prior to August. She is unnamed in the series. She apparently has a job at a local bar. She is clueless with little to no knowledge of the world or even herself. And to add to the injury, Heroine is unable to complete a full sentence most of the time! It&#039;s hard to take her character with these sort of ideas from the very beginning but the series must be doing something right to attract the fans, right?<br />
<br />
Well, perhaps that part comes with the gentlemen of the series~<br />
<br />
Among several of the characters are the bishonens. They are presented as the guys that the Heroine has prior connections with. Each of them represents a different suit symbol such as Shin (Heart), Ikki (Spade), Toma (Diamond), Kent (Clubs), and Ukyo (Joker). All of them are dressed in a flamboyant way with their stylish clothing that can be very appealing to the ladies. Unfortunately though, they don&#039;t seem to hold any more meaning to that. The main problem here is the story. Yes, it&#039;s based on a game so there would be alternations but I feel like the series is rushed way too fast.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s break this down a little and see where it goes. <br />
<br />
The series takes place on August 1, which is in the middle of dog days. Does that hold any sort of significance? Whether it does or not, the series doesn&#039;t present itself too well especially after the thrilling ending of the pilot episode. Because immediately  after that, Amnesia shifts to the romance aspect of the series as Heroine seems to be already in relationship with one of the guys. As the episodes progresses, we learn that Heroine in fact has connections with several of the guys – all romantically in some way. The main problem is though how, when, where, and why? Finally, there&#039;s the supernatural part of the story with a curious little (and to add..annoying) pixie named Orion. The show in my opinion reached a new level of annoyance the second he opened his mouth. He is a creature that is only visible by Heroine herself and he seems to be the most mysterious of them all. Maybe he is able to recover Heroine&#039;s memories. Maybe he is the one who caused them in the first place. Maybe he knew Heroine prior to her amnesia. Maybe he knows the other guys as well. That&#039;s a lot of maybes.<br />
<br />
The story itself also has problems with being a bit rushed in particular one of my favorites later on. As a matter of fact, each of the main male characters only gets so little to explore their connection with Heroine. Of course, this doesn&#039;t come as a major surprise as result of the show&#039;s given length. Regardless though, the story comes as a rushed narration and one that lacks flavor. YUCK. <br />
<br />
Speaking of which, Heroine herself has many problems besides just her amnesia. In fact, she is presented as being foolish, deficient, unintelligent, and literally a BAKA. Her foolishness even puts herself at dangerous situations such as being nearly drowned and falling off a cliff. At first, it looked serious but at many times, it&#039;s almost laughable. That and the fact that she can rarely complete a full sentence further enhances such criticism of her weak character. <br />
<br />
The series does bring in some interesting concepts though. In fact, it seems that all the routes will be explored despite their rushed sequences. As such, all the main male characters get their own spotlights with Heroine. The mysterious atmosphere brings a majestic feeling as well with its strange delivery. It makes viewers wants to know what happens next rather and hoping some of their questions will be given answers. That and the fact that the characters&#039; designs are visually appealing can be attractive for the audience. Furthermore, I feel like the seiyu did a terrific job with their voice acting. Even Heroine who can rarely complete a full sentence is portrayed in a direct way to show how real she is that of having an amnesia. All the other male characters&#039; voices fits their personality as well and in general makes some sense.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately though, these factors added together do not justify enjoyment for me in this series. The story is just too unbelievable with too many things going on at once. Some of these things makes little sense such as a group of girls attempting to bully Heroine on a daily basis out of jealousy (?). Among others, there is a mysterious female and another seemingly antagonist who often seems be a thorn to Heroine&#039;s quest to regain her memory. Even so, Heroine herself lacks motivation and often relies far too much on her boyfriends. Needless to say (but I&#039;ll say it anyways), she is useless. She is considered a joke and not even funny. In fact, this show has no humor and for whatever reason, it tries to force it through its dialogues. Speaking of which, the dialogues all follow a monotone like sequence. They lack flavor or an entertaining style. Hell, I can watch the New York stock exchange for more entertainment.<br />
<br />
In terms of artwork, this series did well. The way the characters are dressed are very appealing and has that majestic feeling. To add to the mix, their eyes are decorated with stylish outlines and a creative touch. It keeps some of the audience interested but at many times, it just looks like a distraction that has little to do with the actual content of the story.<br />
<br />
The music/soundtrack is mediocre for the series from my perspective. The OP song, &quot;Zoetrope&quot; by Nagi Yanagi is quite catchy as it depicts a montage of the main characters with the male protagonist. However, at many variances, it only seems to be appealing with no merit to any morality. In fact, Amnesia itself has no real value in its story besides a Heroine being a useless girl. Such a pity to be honest.<br />
<br />
Overall, Amnesia is a series I hope I will forget. Well, if it comes to visuals, it caught my attention but beyond that leads to nothing more than a palm in the face. When watching the Heroine, it&#039;s almost like telling yourself &#039;why, just why is she so useless?&#039; That source even puts her own life at danger in various circumstances until her knight in shining armor can save her. And of course, that usually happens in this series anyways. Let&#039;s not also forget that annoying pixie by the name of Orion as well with mystery written all over it. I wished this series was good. Honestly, I did but this series dropped the ball. If you do plan on watching it, I do hope you enjoy it. However for me, I just want to forget it...forget it like an Amnesia of no tomorrow.

    Amnesia is by far one of the worst anime I&#039;ve ever watched. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know if I missed something or if I just don&#039;t understand reverse harem but this was one of the worst anime I&#039;ve ever watched. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with the story. <br />
Basically it&#039;s about a girl with no memories who die every fourth episode and restart from August 1 with a new boyfriend. <br />
<br />
I guess the story had potential but it didn&#039;t even get close to the greatness it could have achieved. <br />
<br />
I thought it was going to start up all tangled, which it did, then sort out into a massive mind blow.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review187839">
        The only blow I got was an explosion of disappointment because it turned out to be one of the most pathetic love stories I have ever encountered. I would love to go in to detail but since you&#039;re not allowed to write spoilers in a review I can not tell my most delicious insults towards this shallow and superficial 3 episode love that goes on between the characters..... Oops! <br />
<br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s move on to the characters shall we? <br />
The first thing i want to comment on is that the anime does a great job satisfying all the shippers and bringing out the characteristics of the boys by allowing the main character  2 - 3 episodes to get to know them. That way the fan girls can fan girl over their tragic personalities and i can puke on how ridiculously stereotypical they are. <br />
<br />
We have Mr. Braincells who is socially awkward and doesn&#039;t understand love.<br />
The mysterious negative emo with a broken home.<br />
An extremely energetic big brother type and not to forget <br />
the disgustingly slimy womanizer who tries to make you feel sorry for him because all the girls fall for him. <br />
<br />
(so far this anime still sounds kind of interesting... damn...)<br />
<br />
No offence to those who had a favorite boy. I&#039;d by lying if I said I didn&#039;t.  After all I&#039;m a girl and most of us are infected with shipping disease. There has to be a couple right? <br />
<br />
Oh! there is also a supporting character that is supposed to be helping the main character to get through her amnesia but he pops up for 2 minutes every 4 episodes and gives almost no help at all. Well... maybe he does. He tells her when to talk and run at least because apparently, she doesn&#039;t know when to do that. Which brings me to the worst, saddest, most pathetic female lead in the history of anime.  <br />
<br />
She was so pathetic she didn&#039;t even deserve a name and there fore, I can not insult her by using her name because she really doesn&#039;t have one. <br />
<br />
Out of all the important memories you&#039;d want to return, your name should be a priority right? Neither did anyone else bother to use it at any point during these 12 episodes....hmmm... *suspicion rises* <br />
<br />
Now let me sum up her personality in three simple words you probably learned in kindergarten and if you ever watch the show, you&#039;ll realize how spot on I am: <br />
<br />
Walking, talking, rock. <br />
<br />
Sometimes she wasn&#039;t even talking at all. Just making weird little shy girl sounds. That didn&#039;t bother me as much as the fact that she couldn&#039;t do anything by herself though. She couldn&#039;t even think by herself. In a dangerous situation she did nothing unless someone told her what to do. If you ever want to complain about something objectifying women, complain about this. She was just like an object and not more interesting than the hat she is always wearing on her kawaii little head. <br />
<br />
Which brings me to the art style.<br />
I did not love the art style since I&#039;m not particularly fond of hair sticking out of their heads like spiky antennas or the weird three colored eyes that makes it look like they are constantly sleepy or bored but after a while it became oddly satisfying and I started to realize the slight charm hidden behind those weird goth clothes. <br />
<br />
I can not comment on the soundtrack very much since it wasn&#039;t very memorable and the opening and ending didn&#039;t really interest me so i can&#039;t comment on those either since I always skipped. <br />
<br />
So to end my positive review: <br />
This anime wasn&#039;t as good as it could have been since it had a weak story line and a bad ending not to mention the superficial bonds that were created between the boring, spine less characters that couldn&#039;t convince me one bit when they confessed their love all over the place. They couldn&#039;t even manage to carry out the one thing the whole anime was about (giving her her memories back)<br />
The art style was peculiar but oddly satisfying while the soundtrack wasn&#039;t memorable at all. It was bad from episode 1 and it was a drag getting through the episodes although they were only 12. <br />
The ending was a twist but it was not believable enough to even deserve a reference and if you like this anime and think I&#039;m wrong and made a bigger mistake than Microsoft Office when they gave birth to Clippy, I am not sorry, i just didn&#039;t like this anime. <br />

    I actually realized something after watching 4 episodes.<br />
This is all related to that green long haired crazy joker dude.<br />
Whenever that girl has an accident, she goes back to August 1st and she dates a different guy.<br />
The second and third episode was Shin because she fell down a cliff at episode 1.<br />
After that, she somehow got back to August 1st when it was clearly August 2nd.<br />
Somehow, she got hit by a bus on August 3rd and went back to August 1st.<br />
But the problem is, that whenever there is an accident, she gets back to August 1st and dates a different guy O.O<br />
Enough of that.<br />
The art was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review85309">
        very nice. Like one of the best. The multi-coloured eyes were really pretty and creative. And the person that makes the art does it so everybody looks very different from each other.<br />
The music<br />
I enjoyed the opening. I never skip it. The ending, i&#039;m not so sure but it&#039;s good too.<br />
Characters<br />
The main girl character (She doesn&#039;t have a name like seriously!!!) Is the girl that always gets back to August 1st. She has a clueless personality.<br />
I really like this anime. One of the most interesting I watched.

    Amnesia. Oh well, how do i say it. I was actually disappointed with the pilot episode and the next after that. It is an adaptation of an otome game with the same title. I was expecting this anime since it is a reverse harem type and it turns out to be a downer. First the story, it is about a girl who has an amnesia who sees a flying kind of fairy meet demon like boy named Orion who claims to be a spirit from another world who accidentally stumbled upon her spirit that caused him to be trapped in her soul and thus caused

          <span style="display: none;" id="review85091">
        the amnesia. That Orion character was designed like those fairies from shugo chara but more cuter and bishounen type and that&#039;s what makes it confusing cause I do not know what the character was trying to pull off.<br />
<br />
The protagonist herself was not impressive she&#039;s boring and her character is so soft spoken that you can&#039;t feel any spark of spontaneity or even life out of her character like someone whose very uninterested. She lacks life. She doesn&#039;t even seem to panic waking up not having memories and not even knowing her name. On top of that she doesn&#039;t even seem to be shocked seeing a floating boy that only she can see and hear. I mean what the hell!? She just goes with the flow and listens to what Orion tells her to do. She&#039;s passive and uninteresting like she doesn&#039;t have a goal or even a purpose whatsoever. She also kind of collapse in every opportunity she gets. Haha. I mean just because you have an amnesia doesn&#039;t mean you have to collapse every freakin time. <br />
<br />
The bishies surrounding her were all but hands down handsome and they all work at a maid/host cafe. They&#039;re eyes were designed with two colors which is somehow interesting. The four bishies represents the four suits of cards, the heart, spade, diamond and clover. I thought at first that this is some kind of servant like where the four boys protect the girl with some power since they represent the suits like in hiiro no kakera and fushigi yuugi but turns out the representation of card suits doesn&#039;t seem to relate in anyway. I don&#039;t know in the future maybe they will, but so far the magic kind of protecting thing is out of the picture. <br />
<br />
The costume designs of the characters were like emo rockstars meet loli like ripped shirts and too many belts, frilly laces and the likes. I know you won&#039;t expect much on reverse harem genre but it&#039;s not like you can&#039;t make it interesting at the very least. The overall setting was kind of gloomy and personally for me depressing. I don&#039;t know it just give that sort of vibes. Well as of now it doesn&#039;t give me a reason to continue but i&#039;ll still try until i reached episode 5 then I&#039;ll drop it if it will still be boring as hell. The handsome guys can&#039;t compensate the depressed feeling I get afterwards the end of the episode. I&#039;m really hoping against hope that it will turn out okay.<br />
 <br />
Anyway, on the positive side there are kind a lot of &quot;romantic&quot; scenes that as a girl you might want boys to do that with you like they like and care for you so much kind of thing. The unexpected kisses and the catching you when you tripped kind of thing. So if you&#039;re just into that feel good romantic kind and doesn&#039;t care much about the personality of the characters and the story then you might give it a try maybe you&#039;ll like it but I suggest you move to other animes that will make your viewing time well spent.

    Story:  Well this anime is still being made, so i cant fully judge how good it is, but even though some say its bland, i would disagree.  I like the mystery of the show, and how when the main character learns something, i learn something to.   We get to piece together her life and her situation with her.<br />
<br />
Art:  I like the artwork and style of clothing of the characters.  I like the different color choices that the artist uses, i cant help but think the colors deal with the story.  <br />
<br />
Character:  Some say that the main character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review86961">
        is to boring and inexpressive, but i dont really mind that in this anime.  She doesnt remember who she is or any of the experiences that shaped her personality, so naturally she always seems kind of jaded.  I hope as the story develops more we get to see her develop to.  The bishie characters are also interesting, and im expecting in the future episodes to see them develop.<br />
<br />
I really enjoy the mood and mystery of this anime, thats why i  would rate it an 8 so far.

    Ok, so I finally just finished Amnesia.  In my attempt to watch every episode I awaited for each episode of her confusion for me to be a little less confused.  I tried to make sense of what was going on and where they were going to go with the story, and then I saw the end.  I was actually disappointed that I had wasted my time watching it.  <br />
<br />
Story:  You can&#039;t really explain much of the story without ruining the horrible &quot;mystery&quot; I suppose.  Heroine has amnesia, who knew right...in which every episode is her trying to figure out

          <span style="display: none;" id="review91067">
        what&#039;s going on, and who she&#039;s with.  Yes, it&#039;s a reverse harem.  The story to me was awful.  They could have put a lot more effort into creating more drama and mystery, but you were left more with a scratching your head in a bad way wondering what&#039;s going on rather than a cognitively stimulated way.  And then the end came. Then the end came and I felt like it dragged on forever.  I sat literally wondering, &quot;When is this going to be over, and are they going to actually do something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Art: The art isn&#039;t bad, it&#039;s colorful, and bright.  However, the characters eyes are left with you wondering if they have some &quot;special&quot; power...but maybe that&#039;s just the style they used.<br />
<br />
Characters:  The characters in this story were terrible.  I felt like some were randomly thrown in and the connections they had to the MC were completely irrelevant or stupid.  A lot of the characters had no back story, especially the Heroine, the one you probably could have used a little bit of a back story on.  You don&#039;t get much however.  Their interaction with each other is unnatural and odd.  The characters in this series disappointed me greatly.<br />
<br />
Overall:  I didn&#039;t really do enjoyment because I don&#039;t feel like I enjoyed much of this anime at all.  I can say if you want an anime with sustenance do not watch this anime.  If you want an anime with a good mystery that leaves you wanting more, this isn&#039;t it.  If you want a dull and boring anime that has bright and pretty colorful characters you can stare at that really don&#039;t mean anything, then this anime is for you!  My overall experience of this anime is poor.  I was hoping by some means they would thrill me somehow with the end, and really come out with some amazing plot twist or something...but that didn&#039;t happen for me.

    Amnesia: I Wish I Had It After This<br />
<br />
Actually, you know what, I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;ll be contracting amnesia when it comes to this series because it is one of the more forgettable pieces of work I&#039;ve seen so far this year. It was incredibly underwhelming. It&#039;s sad to see Brains Base put out such a terrible piece of work, especially considering how well they&#039;ve done with series&#039; like Natsume Yuujinchou, Baccano, Spice+Wolf and Durarara. This series doesn&#039;t even come close to capturing the same magic as those series. So where did this series go astray? Honestly, it fails when it comes to its plot and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review91059">
        its characters. <br />
<br />
Amnesia is about a girl who wakes up on August 1st only to find out that she has amnesia (go figure) and doesn&#039;t remember anything prior to the date she awakened. As soon as she wakes up, she discovers she can see a strange, fairy-like being known as Orion that no one else can see, as Orion tries to assist this girl in trying to recover her memories. As the series progresses, the protagonist continues to get into accidents only to awaken on August 1st all over again, except she seems to awaken in an alternate dimension where her relationships are slightly different.<br />
<br />
This series was painful to watch for many reasons. The first being the characters are downright terrible. The protagonist isn&#039;t even given a name throughout the series. I&#039;m assuming the biggest reason is due to Amnesia being an adaptation to a visual novel where you program your own desired name. Having a nameless protagonist works fine in a visual novel...but not an anime. The protagonist felt detracted from the rest of the characters because she had no name or at least wasn&#039;t referred to by name. It&#039;s just hard to get invested in a nameless character. The least Brains Base could&#039;ve done was give her a name. Can you imagine if Aniplex didn&#039;t name the lead protagonist in the Persona 4: The Animation? It would be so much harder to get invested in &quot;Yuu Narukami&#039;s&quot; character because it would be detracting that the other characters won&#039;t refer to him by name. At any rate, to get back on topic, that&#039;s still no excuse for the rest of the characters. Besides Ukyou, all of the characters felt bland as cardboard and that might be an insult to cardboard. All of her potential love interests were either uninteresting or just had unappealing personality quirks. Still, as much as I disliked all of the characters, the protagonist ground my gears the most. While I realize she had amnesia and that can throw off how you would normally act, her thoughts and actions were completely illogical. Her methods of trying to get her memories back were extremely round-a-bout and it seemed like whenever she decided on doing something, I smacked my forehead out of frustration and screamed &quot;idiot!&quot; at my computer screen. The protagonist was a weak character with almost no redeemable qualities whatsoever. She acted illogically, she had zero personality, and the series provided very little motivation to her character whatsoever. I haven&#039;t seen a lead female protagonist in an anime this bad since watching Felicita in Arcana Famiglia. <br />
<br />
The plot and story was abysmal. I will admit that this series did have a nice mystery element at first. It was really the only reason why I even kept watching because I was intrigued as to why she would continue to wake up on August 1st and I was intrigued as to why she kept ending up in different dimensions. However, the payoff was far from satisfactory and I felt duped by the time it was all said and done. The explanations that were given to us in the end were baffling at best and all-in-all, I was still left with more questions than answers. On top of that, I found this series to be riddled with cliches and the scriptwriting to be downright piss poor. <br />
<br />
The animation is sadly one of the better aspects of this series and even then, I wouldn&#039;t call it &quot;good.&quot; From a technical standpoint, the animation isn&#039;t bad. I just found the character designs to be dreadful. Overall, I just couldn&#039;t get past how ridiculous the character and costume designs were for each character. While I am aware that the series was trying to implement a &quot;playing card&quot; atmosphere for each character, how they were designed was off-putting and somewhat corny. One of the more off-putting aspects of it was how the characters never changed clothes. They continuously looked and dressed the same throughout the entire thing. The ONLY costume change I can recall is the lead protagonist in her normal everyday clothes and her night gown. That&#039;s it. Again, much like the character name, that is something that might work in a visual novel, but not an anime. <br />
<br />
I will say ONE good thing about Amnesia. It did have some really good music composition. This was Yoshiaki Dewa&#039;s first series in regards to music direction and I must say, he did a remarkably good job. The theme songs by Yagi Yanagi and Ray were both really well done and they were the few bright spots I can say about this series. <br />
<br />
All-in-all, I have only a few words to share for Yoshimitsu Ohashi (Director) and Brains Base. This was terrible. This was an absolutely terrible attempt at adapting a visual novel that probably would&#039;ve been difficult to adapt in the first place. They committed several cardinal sins in the adaptation process and some of which are downright unforgivable. The best way I can describe it on the whole is lazy. This series was lazily written and lazily produced. It didn&#039;t try to tell a compelling story. It didn&#039;t try to create an engaging romance between the protagonists and the love interests. It didn&#039;t try in almost every aspect of anime production. I cannot recommend this series to anyone and I can assure you this is probably going to end up on my Worst Animes of 2013 list. If there was ever an example of how to NOT adapt a visual novel to anime, Amnesia is probably the best example I can think of.

    Well it&#039;s kinda strange and interesting at the same time, when the girl goes into an accident she goes back to august 1st and dates another guy like when she dated Shin and now she&#039;s dating Ikki i guess her memory stopped at August 1st and thus when ever she goes into an accident she then go back to August 1st. She&#039;s supposed to regain her memories back so that she could continue her life and never get back to August 1st again...

    Anime so bad it&#039;s worth watching!<br />
Heroine has no personality at all, just a blank sheet of paper which can communicate by sounds of inhaling air. Every other character is a cliched, yet another typical shoujo persona: super-cheerful female friend, the dark and mysterious bishounen, the caring and funny childhood friend, you know - the usual stuff.<br />
The story? Romance them all and find out whom you like the most! And die once in a while. Literally.<br />
The music is bland and forgettable, but I liked the opening and ending. <br />
If you like facepalming yourself few times per minute while watching some poorly animated, wanna-be-deep-and-mysterious anime, this is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review86895">
        the thing you&#039;re looking for. Great for watching with friends! Just bring gallons of alcohol and make shots every time our nameless heroine says &quot;eeh&quot;. Have fun, I certainly do!

Okay, I take back what I&#039;ve said before. Amnesia is better than the animes I compared it with. Finally it seems to get really interesting and exciting because of this time leap and time switch confusion. Well, the girl is still lifeless but the riddle becomes quite interesting. It&#039;s pretty cliché shoujo atmosphere but at least that&#039;s not everything and there are many open questions which make you want to know more about the circumstances. <br />
And I kind of enjoy Shin&#039;s dominat temper towards her. ;) Furthermore, I&#039;m curious about the attitude of the other male characters when they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review85223">
        become a part of her life in this time leaping world. ;)<br />
<br />
--- status: 3/12 episodes | Overall rating: 5<br />
Amnesia reminds me of Neo Angelique Abyss and Kimi ga Nozomu Eien: <br />
The heroine is mentally absent, puzzled, confused, obedient, submissive, has a lack of own opinions, no temper and is boring. There&#039;s nor charm nor allurement. There&#039;s a supporting character (in Kimi: the sister | in Amnesia: the ghost) who is kind of annoying. In Angelique and Amnesia you can find many pretty boys but this cannot replace any content. <br />
<br />
At least there&#039;s a ray of hope and that&#039;s why I think this series might get interesting. Her boyfriend, Shin, says the heroine&#039;s personality is different from before. Usually, she&#039;d get angry if he kissed her or become upset when he did this and that - but this usual reaction was missing and he remarked it. So maybe she had a personality and is on her way to get it back? <br />
<br />
Also some characters might get interesting and that&#039;s why I&#039;ll watch it for a while. There still might be some potential but I don&#039;t expect much of it.<br />
<br />
However, the art is really beautiful and the character&#039;s two-colored eyes are pretty creative.

    Hi this is my first review i decided to write this as this Anime seems to have very few good review&#039;s when i think i does deserve.<br />
<br />
Story 8/10<br />
For the first few episodes of this Anime i was left very confused yet intigued. This kept me watching the new episode as soon as it was available and subbed. Although many will watch reverse harem&#039;s for the romance that is in them i think this story is good for it&#039;s mystery aspect instead. The thing that let the story down i found was that it wasn&#039;t long enough which didn&#039;t give it long enough to develop the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review103857">
        mystery<br />
<br />
Art 10/10<br />
The art in this anime was the first thing that made me want to watch it. The art in this anime is very pretty and detailed. It the effects of the shadows and sudden colour were very good for setting the mood.<br />
<br />
Sound 8/10<br />
The sound in this anime was nice and simple although it didn&#039;t particially stand out to me other than the opening and ending which i never skipped. But it was very nice so i think it deserves an 8/10.<br />
<br />
Character 6/10<br />
Some of the characters were very interesting and unexpected however other character&#039;s were very predictable and stereotypical. If it were only some side character&#039;s that were predictable it would have been good but instead the main character was one of them.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9/10<br />
Despite the flaws in this anime i thoroughly enjoyed this anime and am waiting for the game to be translated into english so that i can find out more of the mystery. <br />
<br />
Overall 8/10<br />
Overall this anime wasn&#039;t perfect but if your looking for an anime with some mystery, some romance and Amazing art i recommend Amnesia.

    Story: 5/10<br />
- Given that the anime made the viewer (that is me) wanting to keep watching until the mystery unraveled.<br />
<br />
This anime brings a lot of emphasis into the protagonist of the story, who is a lost girl with no memories of herself at all. In the anime, she produces a scarce personality where the guy characters could do ALMOST anything to her without a  fight. She does not feel any specific emotions throughout the story and she lacks character. She would react with a character the same way with another because of this lack of personality. Although she has amnesia, this lost attitude is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review96905">
        what made the other characters seem more important than the &#039;Heroine&#039;.<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
<br />
The art in this anime was amazing. The eyes of the characters were colourful and brought a lot of life into them. The male characters were given a slim overall body shape and the main female character was given a (I guess) an average look.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
<br />
I loved the specific ending&#039;s music box melody, the ending theme, the opening theme. The music box melody gave a lot of feelings and emotions in the anime. As for the opening and ending theme, they were produced very well that was quite catchy for me.<br />
<br />
Character: 6/10<br />
<br />
Although I did not like the Heroine&#039;s personality, I liked her innocent and caring self. It sometimes made me think that it&#039;s too unreal to be true, even with amnesia. <br />
<br />
As for the male characters, I did not like most of them due to their assertiveness throughout the story (except for one). However, I like the uniqueness of each of the male characters and how each of them are valued differently by the Heroine.<br />
<br />
 Enjoyment: 6/10<br />
<br />
I enjoyed when the Heroine is able to develop through the story. She produces a more distinct self as the anime goes on. I also enjoyed how she reacts with the various male characters in the plot. However, the ending seemed rushed, where most of the mystery unravels at the end of episode 11. <br />
<br />
Overall: 6/10<br />
- I would recommend this to viewers who likes mystery in a way; however, make sure to not be too surprised at the end of the anime.<br />

    Here is a review coming from some of the first  who actually watched all episodes. I&#039;ve anxiously waited for the final episode... Amnesia is a series full of mystery and internal struggle on the canvas of alternative world traveling,all while adding a drop of romance to finish the cocktail. It begs its viewers to do some detective job in order to understand it, I know this because I had a hard time at first putting all the  facts together or you can say I&#039;m somewhat of a dummy.<br />
Here is a personal opinion that I assume nobody gives a damn about:<br />
Great story, very intriguing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review90991">
        art concept for both background and characters. Epic OST&#039;s (some of the best I&#039;ve heard). Also characters are totally different from one another except they have this air of coolness about them.<br />
General opinion<br />
A very dramatic piece of art that shows how much someone can do to accomplish a wish out of love.<br />
Hope you like it... and if you don&#039;t,well, bummer.

    Amnesia was anime which I accidentally stumbled upon and at first glance it seemed like something which I would particularly enjoy, but little did I know it was a reverse harem, so for me this was a major disappointment.<br />
<br />
Story 4/10<br />
<br />
Like many harems and reverse harems, Amnesia lacked a stable plot line and there were massive gaps which were never filled at the end of the anime. The story itself sounded intriguing, but as I continued through the episodes I found myself wondering how each one will match up to the description which I read. It did however match up to its main genre, a reverse

          <span style="display: none;" id="review153215">
        harem which is one positive thing about this anime. <br />
<br />
Art 7/10<br />
<br />
This was one of the main reasons I decided to finish this anime, the art was not brilliant, but I enjoyed the card theme which was displayed throughout the anime and I have to admit, the outfits were somewhat amazing. Other than that the manner in which the characters themselves, excluding the outfits, were somewhat normal, but all in all the art did give this anime some form of value.<br />
<br />
Sound 8/10<br />
<br />
Along with the art the sound, especially the opening song, did do their job somewhat well and I was impressed by the effort they placed within the music. I have to say the sound of the anime usually makes or breaks it for me and what can I say, even though this anime fell under the genre I would usually avoid, it did have great sound sound quality. <br />
<br />
Character 3/10<br />
<br />
This was, well, extremely poorly done. There was little if none character development and the main character just made me frown. She was barely spoke and never really truly developed. If it had not been for the great music and the intriguing art theme I would not have been able to finish this anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 3/10<br />
<br />
I did not at all enjoy this anime, but it had a few humors moments which made it somewhat enjoyable. But all in all this was not an anime for me.<br />
<br />

    First of all, I can&#039;t understand why people give this Anime a bad review after watching 1-3 episodes. A lot of people mentioned the reason they dropped it is the story line being too confusing to understand. Now, if you would read the synopsis of this anime, you could guess that it won&#039;t be easy to understand, especially since it&#039;s not fully aired. Just because you can&#039;t comprehend, it doesn&#039;t mean the story is bad. A lot of animes start off weird and slowly explain what&#039;s going on. No one can expect to fully understand what is happening in Amnesia after 6 Episodes.  I&#039;ll

          <span style="display: none;" id="review88751">
        try to keep spoilers as low as possible here. <br />
<br />
Now to the review itself, what actually got me drawn to this Anime was the (for me) outstanding and appealing art style. It is obviously a Shoujo-Anime so the target audience is mainly female. I&#039;ve seen a lot of people describing the main character, Heroine, as dull, boring, quiet and a bit silly. I think she is a cute and kind character and it is pretty obvious, that after losing all her memories, not knowing who she is, where she is and what her relationships with any of the people she meets are, she is just being cautious and doesn&#039;t know how to interact properly. Especially in the following episodes where she is waking up in a new world (always on the 1st of August) with mixed up memories and relationships again (mostly without Orion&#039;s guidance) she gets confused. <br />
<br />
However, I&#039;m not too judgmental of it yet since I&#039;ve watched a lot of Animes that start explaining what&#039;s happening in the last few episodes. <br />
Of course after watching 6 episodes so far you can guess that it has a lot to do with Ukyo (the green haired dude who is friendly to her but seems a bit vicious when he&#039;s alone) and my guess is that before she&#039;s being sent  to another world, she always dies in the previous one (various incidents that could cause death&#039;). This is merely an assumption though.<br />
<br />
Anyway, can&#039;t wait for the next episodes! Absolutely love the idea so far, will see what they make of it.

         All I see is people complaining but I didn&#039;t think it was horrible. Honestly when I started it I was hoping for a bit more action. The characters themselves looked like they&#039;d fit an action/ fantasy anime more than this. <br />
     The art was pretty amazing if I do say so myself but the story line was lacking. The first episodes I found incredibly boring but it picked up in the end. The characters personalities didn&#039;t match their looks and yes this is pretty much a huge reverse harem for girls who like attractive boys in

        anime. <br />
     I&#039;m a bit disappointed really, I was expecting so much more out of this anime than I got and the sad thing is that the author could have done so much more with it. I gave it a 6 because I did enjoy it to some degree it just didn&#039;t meet my expectations.

    WOW so many reviews giving this show such a negative publicity !! Well the show is not at all poor in any sense.<br />
<br />
Writing this review after watching 7 eps. and I have to say, I totally look forward to this show every week. In fact its hard to wait for a week actually to see what&#039;s gonna happen next.<br />
<br />
Story [10/10]: I loved the concept of the show- A girl, who, every time she experiences some kind of shock wakes up, finds her surroundings changed. How she and the people around her respond to it is the essence of the story till now. I loved the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review87343">
        direction of this show. The scenes change at a very good pace which keeps the mystery alive in each episode. And especially the last scene cut at the end of Ep. 7. It was so subtle!<br />
<br />
Art and Animation [10/10]: Full marks here as well :) The characters are all gorgeous and the backgrounds are well suited to all the scenes. Animation is top notch for me as well.<br />
<br />
Sound [8/10]: The OP and ED are both very groovy. The background music isn&#039;t too much noticeable.<br />
<br />
Character [8/10]: I loved the way the girls character was handled. Her responses to all the things she experiences was very well crafted. As for the guys they are not bad. All are suspicious looking at the beginning but you get a flavor of their personalities with each episode. When the protagonist is in a particular world with one guy, the others dont even appear anywhere. This can be both a positive or a negative point - The former -&gt; since it helps in highlighting the incidents of a particular world where one of them is the girl&#039;s partner. The latter -&gt; Since the creators of the show could have added many situation in which such interactions of the girl would be complicated by including the other characters influence to the flow of events. But again I am satisfied fully with watching what I am shown :)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment and Overall [9/10]: I am enjoying every bit of this show. Its got all the right amount of mystery to it And the pace of the show is good as well. So completely recommended to watch *thumbs up*
