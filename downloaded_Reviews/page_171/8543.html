    Ok Silver Link, here&#039;s the deal.  When you decide on your projects for the season, please spare ALL of us and never make more than one thing per season.  Because given your track record, you either spread your budget so thin that you completely ruin everything that you&#039;re making at one time, or, you devote most of your time to one project while leaving the other one to dry with such poor quality that it can be considered as both a waste of money and time.  And so, here&#039;s Silver Link&#039;s summer 2016 mistake, Ange Vierge.<br />
<br />
Story: In the world of Ange Vierge,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230051">
        girls (yes, only girls.  Big shocker.) are able to gain &#039;special&#039; powers and become someone known as a &#039;Exceed&#039; who&#039;re...special fighters, or something.  Exceeds come from the 5 worlds of Ange Vierge, all of whom have ridiculous names (like f**king DARKNESS EMBRACE.  Yes, that is the name of one of the worlds.) and fight against the Ouroboros, unnamed and unexplained creatures who want to join all 5 worlds to create the...apocalypse, or something like that.  We follow the journey of 5 Progress (who&#039;re the fighter characters) and their Alpha Driver (Who I assume is their support/damage sponge, or something) on their quest to save their senpais and the 5 worlds.<br />
<br />
Ok, that is probably the most unsure synopsis that I have EVER written and for good reason.  This show&#039;s story.  Is.  Sh*t.  Ange is one of those fantasy shows that tries to be cool and fails for a number of reasons.  The first reason is how many terms they use to describe the entire world that they attempt to describe.  They&#039;re all given such paper thin explanations that as the episodes roll by, get so confusing when you&#039;re watching the show that whatever the characters say legitimately make zero sense and like they&#039;re making everything up as they go along.  And that&#039;s not even the worst offender.<br />
<br />
Another offender is just how bland, generic, predictable, uninspiring, and boring the entire plotline is.  In a nutshell, the whole point of this series is to go rescue each of the 5 girls&#039; senpais while &#039;saving the world&#039; in the process.  A process that&#039;s so damn easy that it takes all but 2 episodes EACH WORLD to save.  Rinse, repeat, and done.  Hell, I bet Silver Link even knew that their creation was terrible, because they pad the runtime of the series out with so much extra and unneeded crap that you you probably accumulate about 2 full episodes worth of material that ISN&#039;T part of the main story.  Filled with &#039;comedic&#039; yet cringeworthy scenes involving two idiotic sisters joking about things on the battlefield, cutaways to the group of side characters in the command center whose only purpose is to fail at explaining what&#039;s going on because of how nonsensical the show&#039;s terminology is, and a ludicrous amount of bath scenes that spawned the joke that Silver Link&#039;s budget was so thin for this show that they took the clothes off of the girls to save time on the animation.  <br />
<br />
But I think the reason why this show was so terrible is the sheer amount of forced character development the show tries to make the viewer sympathize with.  Every one of the girls&#039; problems in this series feels made up on the spot in order to give the show a reason to continue forward, complete with a backstory that we&#039;re supposed to feel sorry about even though we JUST met the character, and a relationship with the plot device known as &#039;Amane&#039; that&#039;s so lazy that they copypasted that sh*t 5-6 times over.  And guess what?  We don&#039;t get to know ANYTHING about Amane as a person either, or so little that by the end it doesn&#039;t f**king matter.<br />
<br />
So, long story short, the story&#039;s a mess.  Its predictable nature is just barely overshadowed by the sheer amount of sappy and horrendously aggravating &#039;character development&#039;, padding out its runtime with the exact same 5 minutes of opening cutscene to explain what kind of world Ange Vierge is, that you&#039;ll probably skip cause you were sick and tired of it in episode 1.  Oh by the way, did I mention we don&#039;t actually get to know ANYTHING about the Ouroboros?  The supposed villains of the series?  They want to make the apocalypse happen.  They&#039;re just nameless villains who want to end the world for some god unknown reason.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
-  Just...just terrible all-around.  (I cannot be bothered to pinpoint what&#039;s bad in this TL:DR section when literally everything about this series is terrible.)<br />
<br />
Characters:  Ok, these aren&#039;t characters.  They&#039;re puppets.  Puppets forced onto a stage that I doubt that even they wanted to be on.<br />
<br />
Ok, first off, 4 of the 5 main girls of the series, Saya, Elel, Stella, and Alamaria.  All of them are one-note characters, they all have some kind of inferiority complex that make them agonizing to watch because of how much they complain about their inability to match their senpais or whatever, and they all have some form of redemption in the end of their 2 episode arc where they magically gain the power to overcome their senpai through the power of friendship before quickly getting shafted off to move onto the next girl.  Ok, moving on.  <br />
<br />
The only girl I singled out in the list is the one known as Nya, a girl who I think is probably the only half-decent character in this entire series despite only having only a single episode to herself.  She&#039;s tired of everything, thinks everything&#039;s a pain, and doesn&#039;t really have the same sappy and annoying &quot;I&#039;m a failure because I don&#039;t know how to do something&quot; forced character trait that all of the other girls have.  Decent character, just not used at all, even in the one episode where she&#039;s important.<br />
<br />
Then we have Amane.  Oh...Amane.  As the sole reason for why everyone suddenly gains the power of friendship, Amane is revealed to surprise, have the exact same annoying and self-victimization story as the majority of the other main cast.  Not only that, but she somehow influenced everyone to change their life goals and/or entire character despite 1) not being there and 2) act like nothing but a clumsy dunce that for some reason gets people to think of her as a friend.  Like...how?!  Where is the logic in this?  This gap of understanding makes the whole of the series just that much more irritating to watch and I for the life of me spent my time shoving scissors into my ears when I so much as heard her goddamn name in this series.  From what I saw, she&#039;s done absolutely nothing to make even a significant impact on any of these sad excuses for characters which begs to question quality of the writing that much more.<br />
<br />
Everyone else is a situational side character that&#039;s either a senpai used for the &#039;character development&#039; or part of the goddamn command center people who have no character traits to them aside from trying and failing to explain what the hell is going on on the screen at any given point in time.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Nya&#039;s a decent character<br />
-  Everyone else can suck it<br />
<br />
Art: Silver Link&#039;s animation quality is pretty on the ball in terms of how good stuff looks.  Of course, Ange really doesn&#039;t look all too terrible with its moe affiliated artstyle and bright colors, but that could probably be attributed to how lazy the animation crew was when drawing out the scenes.  Hell, the CGI on the Ouroboros wasn&#039;t...that bad.  Noticeable, but not bad.<br />
<br />
Of course, the most noticeable thing about the artwork are the bath scenes.  This show has such a large amount bath scenes that for the first half of the series, at least HALF of the runtime was just seeing the various girls naked in the bath.  Hell, the first episode was ALL bath scenes.  (You&#039;d think that&#039;d dry out their skin.)  But even worse so was the fact that the show reuses a lot of scenes.  Aside from the padded out runtime of from the opening cutscene to explain the goddamn worlds to us for the 10th time, the show constantly goes back to the various senpais in their baths, reusing such scenes until the main characters go to the respective world where they reside to fight them.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Decent artstyle<br />
-  Reuses WAY too many frames<br />
<br />
Sound:  The sound is generic and not all that exciting.  Voice acting is average.  There&#039;s nothing worth noting here.  So we&#039;re moving on.<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment:  I have no idea what I was thinking.  When I started this series, I thought that this was going to be a semi-interesting piece of work from Silver Link that I would have some kind of vague interest in.  The art looked decent, the premise could be mildly entertaining, what could possibly go wrong?  Turns out, EVERYTHING.  EVERYTHING COULD GO WRONG.  Ange Vierge is an anime equivalent of actual torture because of how painfully lazy and generic the entire series is as Silver Link basically threw in as many tropes as they could and mushed them together to see if they could stick.  They based this sh*t off of a card game.  A goddamn card game!  This ain&#039;t Yu-Gi-Oh!  <br />
<br />
Did I enjoy this series?<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I like about this series?<br />
<br />
Everything.  Except maybe Nya.<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this series?<br />
<br />
My recommendation?  Avoid it like the plague.  Unless you like terrible series only about the power of friendship and how powerful plot armor/of a plot device it really is, then be my guest.  Or maybe if you need to dare someone to watch something terrible.  You can use this.

    Unlike most animes that are either based off manga or light novels Ange Vierge is actually based off a card game. This is unusual to say the least. <br />
<br />
The main story revolves around a force of  female warriors and soldiers who are drawn from the different worlds that are connected to the blue world that they live in fighting a war against an alien race called the Ouroboro&#039;s.  As settings go this is actually pretty unique. <br />
<br />
Saya is the main character of the show and the main protagonist. <br />
A relatively new member of the exceed division that is tasked with defending the worlds

          <span style="display: none;" id="review231032">
        against the enemy attackers known as Ouroboros Saya starts the series as an inexperienced member that aspires to get to the top. This stems for her wish to be accepted by others because before she did not have much of a presence as well. <br />
<br />
Saya&#039;s dominant trait is that of determination in that she fights hard for<br />
her dreams and aspirations in order to be recognized by others. Something that we can all relate too. <br />
<br />
However, this first personality puts her at odds with others as she often rushes into things without thinking it through or waiting for backup. After what happened to Amane however and the regrets from that Saya&#039;s personality changes being more trusting of others and being true to them and to Amane. <br />
<br />
The scene where Saya finally told Amane her true feelings though was a great scene and was well done. Saya is easily one of my fav characters on the show. <br />
<br />
Amane is one of the main characters of the series and acts as the team’s main controller providing them with intel and special abilities via their links. <br />
Amane is positive and upbeat by nature and generally happy to have around <br />
however, her true self which forms a vital part of the second half of the series is anything but. One aspect of her character that I liked was he attempt to improve herself in that she can be of better use to the team despite suffering pain in the attempt.<br />
<br />
Yukari Tamura who is the seiyuu for Amane deserves no small amount of praise for her portrayal of Amane in which she did a great job. <br />
<br />
Almaria who I call Alma is a main character and a vampire from the black world. A capable fighter that fights with weapons created with blood Alma is the mother like character that holds the team together. Unlike most vampires who suck blood Alma sees this as embarrassing and refuses to do so but after a desperate action forced her to she has since accepted it. Her interactions with Saya afar that were especially funny. <br />
<br />
Elel is a main character and an angel from the red world. Energetic and friendly and a bit overactive Elel usually acts as comic relief for the series. Due to here friendly nature she can make friends with just about anyone. Elel is one of my fav characters on the show due to he being able to remain positive in even the direst situations and her realization that she has hurt the feelings of some of her friends and subsequent apology was heartfelt. <br />
<br />
Stella is a main character and an android from the white world. <br />
Stella has a thing for speed and humorously enough when she does speed <br />
up she sounds like a motorcycle. Being an android Stella has a limited personality that I felt could be expanded upon. <br />
<br />
Nya is a main character and a soldier from the militarized green world. <br />
Lazy and slothful by nature Nya nonetheless is a capable soldier that always <br />
speaks her mind. Nya to me is the foundation upon the team anchors on. <br />
<br />
Hinata is the student council president of the academy and the strongest fighter in the academy. Beautiful, Elegant and skilled Hinata is everything Saya aspires to be. <br />
<br />
Hinata is kind, considerate to others and always willing to listen to others. <br />
As the strongest fighter in the academy and with a keen mind her duals with the main cast in the end was particularly entertaining. Her seiyuu Yuka Aisaka deserves no small amount of praise for portraying her character so well. <br />
<br />
Ramiel is an angel from the red world like Elel is and was her first true friend. Unfortunately, a misunderstanding caused her to feel that Elel has lied to her causing a story event. Ramiel served as the boss for Elels arc and despite a long road Elel was able to talk to her and tell her true feelings and from there rekindle their friendship. Ramiel was played by one of my fav seiyuu’s Aoi Yuki who gave a particularly strong performance here as Ramiel to which im glad. <br />
<br />
Aurora voiced by my fourth fav seiyuu Saori Hayami is a support character that serves as a field commander for the exceed. Although not given much of a role Saori still managed to portray her character reasonably well as expected of her. <br />
<br />
A support character and a member of the EXR class like Aurora and Ramiel. <br />
While certainly a powerful character she isn&#039;t given much of a role. Yet her byplay with Clara was pretty funny. <br />
<br />
The arts style I found to be pretty good and the environments were nicely drawn. The animation especially the combat scenes was pretty well done. For the character designs I felt that the characters were well designed. <br />
<br />
The series had particularly good music as I loved the opening and ending themes that were used for the show. Konomi Suzuki is an amazing singer and her song love is my rail which served as the opening was amazing. <br />
<br />
A great anime that had a great story, setting, cast of characters and voice acting. The series though had an unusual amount of bath scenes which i found unusual. <br />
<br />

    Ange Vierge: Final Review<br />
<br />
Ange Vierge is an anime very loosely associated with a Japanese TCG. At the time of this review, there&#039;s also some manga material available for those interested. <br />
<br />
The idea behind AV is somewhat simple. There are 5 worlds, each that produces a fairly typecast sort of person. For example, the Black World has lots of dark atmosphere, wizards, vampires, etc. There is a fairy world, a human world, a cyborg world, and so on. At some point, these mirror earths starts being in danger of colliding, and its up to magical girls to save them<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
<br />
Around the time the 5 earths started

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230602">
        being in danger, girls with special abilities were discovered and treated like rock-stars. &quot;Progress&quot;, is what they are called. They are basically girls with powers that could kick super ass and fly. &quot;A drivers&quot;, another type of special girl, are girls who lead the teams of Progress from a command center, and link with girls from their squads to increase their powers. <br />
<br />
These girls are assigned missions to fight weird Ourobouros, who kinda look like big black wangs. Between battles, they laze about naked and complain to each other or have soapy fights in the showers. There&#039;s also something over an over-plot concerning them sparring and fighting, as it releases energy back into the universe, which keeps the worlds from colliding somehow. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s also an acceptable amount of Shonen-esque melodrama about getting stronger to be special.<br />
<br />
So we have a few simple steps.<br />
<br />
1. Take military girls, angel girls, robot girls, fairy girls, gothic girls, and angsty teen girls, throw them together and explain that they are all from different earths, and use them to form battle groups.<br />
<br />
2. Give them a rank up system so there is a clear pecking order. <br />
<br />
3. Make them naked a lot. <br />
<br />
4. Once everyone settles in for a fan service Yuri fest with wiener monsters, you bring out the plot twists, when an event happens that turns the group on it&#039;s heads. <br />
<br />

Art: 9<br />
<br />
This has great art. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s really nice to see all the different girl flavors blend together. The character designs are really good and the animation is solid. Usually, in a B list title like this, they draw you in with good art for a bit then slowly let the &quot;sliding screens&quot; take over. Not the case here. It&#039;s been solid every episode.<br />
<br />
That said, in the first 2 episodes, Fan Service was everywhere, and they handled the censorship really poorly. It&#039;s the only reason I don&#039;t rate the art a 10, even though it has all the deep saturation, color palettes and softer lines I like in my anime. <br />
<br />
Sounds: 8<br />
<br />
Good music and VA. I have no complaints here. End song is great.<br />
<br />
Characters: 7<br />
<br />
So far, the characters are what they are on the surface. Robot girls are cool and calculating. Fairy girls are cute. Military-planet girls are hard-ass battle freaks. Black Magic girls are showy and sultry. Earth girls have determination and grit and plucky resolve. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s a good relationship or two here and there, and the younger girls are attached to their Senpais in a neat way, each of them reflecting the unique relationships that likely occur on their home worlds. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7<br />
<br />
The first episode was annoying because they were naked with boob-mist the entire damn episode. The second was much better and by the 4th you realize they are wasting no time setting up the end game already. <br />
<br />
The show suffers from a bit of lazy writing. As of episode 6, the new plot direction is a bit predictable. It&#039;s still good to watch, as the animation is exciting and the va&#039;s are good. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a bad premise, and it&#039;s certainly not the worst offering of 2016.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall. 7.2<br />
<br />
It&#039;s good, because the art and slightly different take on a battle-tribe works. It&#039;s rating has increased slowly over the last two episodes. The show has a definitive ending, which is always nice.

    I personally liked Ange Vierge. It had really well done character development, minus one or two of the main group of characters. The art was a nice mix of cute, gothis and then the typically anime sexualization of womans&#039; bodies and outfits. There were some finer points of the plot that it would have been nice to have explained but overall it was a good story line with a sastisfying conclusion.<br />
I wouldn&#039;t mind seeing a second season though this is probably one of those shows that you&#039;re better off leaving it at one.<br />
The show is a cross between My Hero Academia and Yuki Yuna is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287687">
        a Hero. It&#039;s not too big on romance seeing as it&#039;s an all-female show, but of course there are little hints of it here and there.<br />

What does it mean to be special? What is true potential? Well let me tell you a story about a wonderful anime about female love friendship and heroines,about growing compassion and other importance in life .This is Ange Vierge and one of the finest gems I have come a crossed and in my meaning the most underrated anime ever!!<br />
<br />
Saya Is flying fast like an angel through the clouds. The sun is high up on a beautiful day with glittering blue skies.The enemy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315254">
        threatens the tranquillity and are going to bring death and destruction to the world.Backup is on the way. But Saya is a proud hotheaded girl who don&#039;t listen to reason are keen to prove how special and strong she is! The heroines draw her lightsaber and fearlessly engage the strong foe! The enemy is superior by number and gain the upper hand,,,,Then all the sudden the foe is being ripped to pieces Elel have arrived and quickly comes to her dear friends aid.Stella Almaria and Nya joins in and now all the girls are gathered! My girls are fearless lionesses that have the strongest of bonds. And if one of them are attacked the rest will come to her aid, and fight as a strong pack of female warriors! And their grand adventure have begun! Combat and glory, But must importantly friendship and love!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story 7/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Five world exist: A black world of darkness magic and mystery.A red world of gods and wonders. A white world  of science and technology.  A green world of military and weapons. Finally a blue world Earth itself and its beauty . Their worlds have been connected  and are now on collision curse! And need the strongest power in the universe to save them all .That power is my girls,,,It&#039;s not the most impressive story but it have to do!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Art 9/10 <br />
<br />
<br />
This anime looks really good.Love the warm colours the character design,The combat animation flows really nice multiple things moving in and background. And I especially like the design on the black world,The girls are cute and it all comes together extremely well<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound 9/10 <br />
<br />
<br />
Love the music everything from calm slow sad to fast pulsing combat ,Happy music comical tones and everything in between. its hits perfect to the scene itself<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Character 10/10 <br />
<br />
<br />
Here its this anime strongest point. And especially Almaria .Before I watch this anime I thought all vampire where animals beast predators evil beings soulless monsters that only care for themselves, but Almaria show me how wrong I was .She is not a predator she is a lovely delightful carrying girl who love her friends. And she is in love with a other female .She would never hurt anyone, she is not a beast nor a monster. Almaria is a kind lesbian vampire with a compassionate soul and the biggest of heart!!! She is the selling point for me and most prodigious reason why I love this anime so much. And we have other strong characters. Like Saya she grows and learns what is important in life! We have the lesbian android who learn to love herself.And so much more. Characters is everything for me I need my girls. And this anime have one of the most lovely sets of character I have ever seen <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Yuri 10/10<br />
<br />
<br />
This anime is full with lesbians warm females and their strong love for each other .The combat is good I get really invested .But most important it take it time to build the characters so i can love them and cheer for them even cry with them.You can not slap a pretty girl in my face and expect that I will care for her just like that! You need to build the love with back stories and everything else. You need to cherish it not just slap it in once face, that doesn&#039;t work for me. Do that and i&#039;m not enjoying myself .Words are cheap i need to believe it. And this anime have one of my favourite scenes of all time my first ever lesbian vampire bite. That have a huge impact on me and is one of my most cherish memory ever in anime!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall 10/10  <br />
<br />
<br />
This is my Yuri heaven .Its not only full of lesbian&#039;s its full of females that love each other to eternity and beyond .And they show it.And it have good fighting interesting side story extremely good character development .But mostly it have so much love that is so warm and drags me in to it. I watch all episode in a row I couldn&#039;t put it down. And the best part for me personal is how I went from having prejudiced hateful opinions about vampires. And then Almaria educated me show me a new side ,and she became my most loved waifus of all time.She helped me grow. For a Yuri lover this is huge and something I can&#039;t recommend enough!!<br />
<br />
 I dedicate this review to my beloved Almaria!!<br />
<br />

    All girls, cute art. I take that.<br />
Let us look together what we find inside of the package.<br />
<br />
<br />
+++ PRO +++<br />
#Cute girls and design<br />
#Lighthearted, easy to watch<br />
#Ecchi (Although I´d prefered it wasn´t that much)<br />
#Relaxing<br />
#Has some good doses of humor in it (Military sisters, Im thinking of you)<br />
#Affection between characters and pairs is really heartwarming<br />
<br />
--- CON ---<br />
#Story felt rush<br />
#Few more ep´s would have definetly helped story and character developement<br />
#Kinda predictable<br />
#Weird double harem scenario<br />
#Ecchi is not fitting for this show IMO<br />
#Ecchi censoring is horrible in this one<br />
#Rumors say even blue ray is censored (Wtf)<br />
#Just cut out the creepy ecchi shit and give us a heartwarming relaxing anime instead<br />
#Moe´ness of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258005">
        one character in general annoyed the shit out of me<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
I kind of liked watching this anime. <br />
On my mission to look for the most relaxing and cute animes, to save world from melancholy and despair, I stumbled across this canidate. <br />
And yes, I can reassure you, this one doesn´t disappoint.<br />
Well at least for the most part. <br />
The first two episodes weren´t all that special and rather boring, but after some time it still caught my interest. Mostly because of the very adorable intercourse and affection of the characters, who make the most part of this anime.<br />
 <br />
We need to talk about bathhouse scenes and F1 car sounds.<br />
<br />
I mean, cute girls, anime, bathhouse, ecchi, well I guess theese things somehow connect. But when we spent half of an episode in a bathhouse with lightning cutting the screen to save the waifus from our lustful looks it becomes tiring. Not because we wanna see nipples, but rather because it´s just not nice to look at given the amount of time we have to. The biggest joke is that rumors say even the Blu ray version is censored. Well RIP.<br />
One thing comes my mind. Why so much nudity then? The show is cute and adorable in itself. No need for that creepy ass shit. Cut it out. It´s uncalled for.<br />
Next case: We have a girl, she appears already in the very first minutes, who is specialized in flying fast, it´s her fighting style. While that in itself is okay, everytime she crosses the screen we hear a sound like a F1 car or a hayabusa. The first time I had to cringe, eventually I truly had to ask myself what the sounddesigners had in mind. Fucking horrible.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the plot, I would say it was rushed. The focus lense is so much on the characters, their pasts and their relationships, that I miss some info about their enemies and universe. There are 5 different worlds. Unfortunately we dont get to know or explore much of them. This is definitely potential wasted. Furthermore it´s kind of a „double harem“ layout, which I found to be weird. All in all I would say the story becomes a little bit repetive and way to predictable throughout the watch.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tell me Kokosnuss is this show for me?<br />
+ If you like cute girls and moe <br />
+ If you enjoy girls only<br />
+ If you look for light entertainment<br />
+ If you like shoujo ai<br />
<br />
- If you demand deep characters and story<br />
- If you are homophobiac<br />
- If you´d be annoyed  by the infinite amount of bathhouse scenes<br />
- Moe could be too much for you<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
### Special info De-Classified for this review ### <br />
Forget the mc´s of the main squad, the real heroes of the show are the military sisters.<br />
Enough said. You will get it when you watch it.<br />

    The opening episode of a show needs to set down the premise and make promises of what is to come further down the line.<br />
<br />
What happens in the first episode of Ange Vierge is nothing more than complete and utter fanservice. The show does hold true to this, but I could barely meet it with more than a shrug. There&#039;s no actual substance in this show. There was a little glimpse of perhaps some character development in the second episode, but by the third episode that is thrown out the window. Most of the characters have flashbacks about a certain character that never really does anything

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230977">
        in the show.<br />
<br />
By the end the heroes are victorious and we&#039;ve been shown a lot of shower scenes with naked girls.<br />
<br />
But there&#039;s no actual substance. It&#039;s like eating one of those Little Debbie fruit pies sold in the store. Sure it may look and taste good, but later down the line you&#039;re going to get diabetes and have all sorts of health problems from poor choice in nutrition. Maybe one cake won&#039;t do it, but repeated eating of them will.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t meet anything in this show with anything other than a &quot;meh&quot;. This could have been a fairly solid battle show, but it&#039;s not got the greatest animation, the music isn&#039;t at all inspiring, and there&#039;s no real enjoyment to be had here.

    Ange Vierge, the show that&#039;s based off a card game I&#039;ve never heard of. It&#039;s got it all, bathhouse scenes where half the screen is censored by beams of light, bland fight sequences, plotholes, and plenty of yuri action. The A-drivers gain barely anything from supporting the Progress, why not just leave? Also, Saya was pretty much an ass in the first couple of episodes. I should actually review this, but it was so mediocre, and that&#039;s my least favourite kind of anime.<br />
<br />
Story: 1<br />
The story existed. It was as generic as can be. Basic &quot;Oh weird black bad guy with no explained motive wants to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344884">
        destroy worlds because yes.&quot; It&#039;s been used a lot of times, I know. However, what makes this one so bad is its execution. The way each character and scenario is brought out really gives no emotion to the viewer, as it&#039;s a character-driven story and we were only just introduced to these characters. There isn&#039;t enough time to get attached, and the characters weren&#039;t interesting enough to get into. Plus, all exposition is either done before a bland fight scene, or a scene where everyone is naked. That&#039;s what makes the story bad.<br />
<br />
Art: 4<br />
The art is at least pleasant on the eye, it&#039;s not anything special, but it does have some pretty cool character designs. However, in some distant shots, it&#039;s obvious the characters are drawn lazily. It&#039;s expected though. The worst part of it is that in a few closer shots, it looks like the character had not been drawn completely. This is apparent in the bathhouse sequences. Also, there are too many shots where we get a zoom-in of a character&#039;s lips.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5<br />
The voices are high pitched, but it&#039;s an all-girls cast. The opening theme, Love is MY RAIL, is relatively good. The ending theme is alright, nothing too special. However, Elel&#039;s crying is extremely annoying. It&#039;s ear-piercing. The rest of the sound wasn&#039;t special, mediocre at best.<br />
<br />
Character: 2<br />
The characters are bland, generic protagonist who is selfish but grows, big boobed fanservice girl, innocent child, lazy one, and emotionless one. Then there&#039;s their A-driver, who&#039;s a bland &quot;tries to be friends but is lonely&quot; archetype. None of the side characters are that interesting either, and their only saving point is their designs. They&#039;re at least cool to look at, but if that&#039;s the only good thing one can say, it&#039;s bad. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 2<br />
The only arc where I felt sad and connected with a character was when Elel had to stop complimenting Rafiel or whoever because she was getting jealous. If only one arc can bring any emotion out of me, and I get emotional pretty easily, you&#039;re doing something wrong.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4<br />
It&#039;s eye-catching, but not worth staying for. The story is character driven, and when the characters are bad, the story becomes bad.

    Did anyone ever count the number of bath scenes in this anime?  I think I&#039;m up to 15 on episode 12.  Yes, there&#039;s at least one per episode excluding the last episode (that&#039;s less of a disappointment and more of a congratulations).  The episode 10 bath scene just kept going, by the way.  Even when they&#039;re shooting up the bath scene, the bath scene still continued...  <br />
<br />
Cough, this show is very straight forward: backstory sequence of what world they&#039;ll now fix (how a certain character met the alpha driver more or less), fighting/fixing that world (lasting one or two episodes),

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246693">
        bath scene(s), any defeated character&#039;s clothes gets torn and some nice censor lines come inbound, and repeat until the worlds are fixed.  <br />
<br />
The story, broadly, is about a team of &quot;drivers&quot; (at least, I think that&#039;s what they&#039;re called as a whole; cough, I saw the first nine episodes like a year ago) whose bonds are weak, but grow in strength through the hardships they&#039;re put through.  I mean, that makes me feel better about the twelfth episode, but their hardships are honestly an extreme word for the whole situation (when the five planets come together -&gt; explosion).<br />
<br />
Lemme go 6 for story.<br />
<br />
I love all of the bad key frames more than anything in this series, to be honest.  That alone made the anime enjoyable (I&#039;ll say a 7 for enjoyment and a 6 for art).  The characters are alright (typically go through the same process of being a &quot;slight&quot; friend of Saya to a &quot;good&quot; friend of Saya with each predicament).  I&#039;ll go 5 for character.  Though Ramiel on the dark side was the best character: https://puu.sh/vBf86/fc8e5f68a5.gif (40-ish MB gif)<br />
<br />
OP&#039;s good and ED&#039;s alright.  More than anything for sound though, I hate Stella&#039;s race car sound effects (please, no more was all I thought by the end).  I&#039;ll go 5 for sound rounding the overall to just about 6.

    Probably the only good thing or at least decent thing about this anime are the characters.<br />
This is the order from best to least likable<br />
Nya Lapucea<br />
Elel <br />
Almaria <br />
Code Ω77 Stella and Saya Sougetsu<br />
The characters are pretty simple and while they do have their own backstories, that&#039;s basically it. But they are likable if you have the time to actually like them.<br />
<br />
The story is meh...bunch of cute girls fighting enemies with a touch of Yuri. And then it turns out that friendship can actually beat your enemies. But wait...your allies turn to the dark side? Mind blown! Reminds of Star Wars.<br />
<br />
Overall, it was ok and while it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230068">
        did have more bad things than good (way more) i&#039;m just gonna rate it with a 6. Hopefully the second season will be better. If there will be a second season.<br />

Oh and the censoring sucks.....<br />

    Pick your Favourite Waifu: The Anime turned Valkyrie Girls Saving the World?...<br />
<br />
Ange Vierge being based on a mobile card game, you&#039;d think LA would be furious about it, it would have been an easy target...well no for LA. Sure it&#039;s a typical card game anime adaptation with an all girls cast, but the one thing Ange Vierge had was a bit of self-awareness and no LA doesn&#039;t mean it in the meta-sense...it more like the anime feels like it&#039;s REALLY is based on a mobile card game with the character rank from C, UC, R to EXR with the plot coming in as something the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230083">
        character interact and develop them one at a time along with the Progress &quot;Amane Ayashiro&quot; voiced by Yukari Tamura might as well be the player and best of all, the story doesn&#039;t take itself TOO seriously.<br />
<br />
LA is taking several liberties as LA does see what&#039;s wrong with this anime but really see what&#039;s good about it.<br />
<br />
Well lets start with what&#039;s bad about it.<br />
<br />
Ange Vierge even from the first episode to the end of the anime has HUGE amount of fanservice especially the first episode with bare naked ladies in a spa-like tower HQ with censors out the wazoo because of it and yes it does keep going with it but being slightly less egregious and blatant with it later down the line where it becomes more to yuri fanservice and shows slightly less skin..emphasis on &quot;slight&quot;. Now you&#039;d expect Amane to be the main protagonist right?..what with the analogy of her being the player as well as controlling her Exceeds partners...well we quickly find out it&#039;s Saya Sougetsu voiced by Minako Kotobuki and already LA needs to point out that early on, Saya becomes vastly whiny and annoying and the entire &quot;wanted to be stronger, blame someone else&quot; motive to her and became grating, thankfully even she gets better from the early episodes as the anime starts focusing on the other cast member&#039;s backstory and personal problems. There was also a bit of filler scenes with military sisters Ageha Sanagi voiced by Sumire Uesaka and Mayuka Sanagi voiced by Nozomi Yamamoto be nothing but filler and created a bit of comedic dissonance when it wasn&#039;t needed (or it&#039;s timing was off..when it was, it...it was ok to say the least). Lastly, people might think that the &quot;sudden dark turn of events quite early&quot; came out of nowhere, but for a better defence, LA will say that it was more of a interesting turn in the plot which leads it into the character development arc episodes and really it could have easily of been a much worse turn, bottom line, the sudden turn that made half of the main cast turn evil and they all have personal beef to the good half of the characters that weren&#039;t brainwashed is a better plot than just a plain good superpowered girls fighting boring evil monsters MUCH better.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation...well done by Silver Link, the character designs and background work of the 5 worlds with all varying degrees of background and aesthetics to them as well as the battles are pretty decent fair for an action/all girls anime, but the animation overall just felt halfway between &quot;decent&quot;, even with the flashy battles (the final battle being the best) and new worlds we get to see and character designs, but gets rather mundane and typical in really everything else and really the fanservice DOESN&#039;T help with the animation.<br />
<br />
Really another problem is due to the huge cast member count to this anime, not EVERYONE is going to get developed, such as the desk-ladies of Aurora voiced by Saori Hayami, Clara voiced by Saya Satou, Dr. Michael voiced by Mai Aizawa and Ruby voiced by Yoshiko Ikuta and most of the de-brainwashed EXR members hardly get any screentime afterwards...really LA can say that with this huge cast count, LA can&#039;t blame them if they couldn&#039;t develop every single character.<br />
<br />
Ange Vierge however has some good points though that make this anime for LA a bit of guilty pleasure...and not from the gratuitous fanservice...<br />
<br />
Ange Vierge once it gets into the character development arcs, they do develop the core cast (including the brainshed members) as well due how they focus on them. Probably the best character arc goes to Almaria voiced by Yumi Hara and Sofina voiced by Mai Ishihara due to the episode length, backstory to their relationship as well some good old blood battles (their vampires so) and was the best wrapped up in terms of Almaria&#039;s character development (and quickly became LA&#039;s favoruite character on the good side), Code Omega77 Stella voiced by Rika Tachibana and Code Omega46 Xenia and Code Omega33 Carene voiced by  Kana Hanzawa and Minori Chihara were ok but a bit cliche with the entire &quot;robots knows human emotions&quot; schtick, Elel voiced by Aki Toyosaki and Ramiel voiced by Aoi Yuuki at best was an anticlimax of an arc building up the &quot;friendship theme&quot; (well in defence they both ARE Angels...so non-fighting? and talking makes more sense of a climax?), Nya Lapucea voiced by Sarah Emi Bridcut and Eins Exaura voiced by Ayane Sakura&#039;s was the quickest to finish but gave a better reasoning and a bit more of a backstory as to why Eins have a personal vendetta against Nya while making the battle rather impactful (as well as FINALLY stopping the inept Sanagi sisters&#039; comedic filler). Shizuka Ito&#039;s character Aoi Mikage is a special case as, well firstly it&#039;s Shizuka Ito doing an evil femme fatale role, what&#039;s not to love, secondly she was LA&#039;s favourite villain because of that, thirdly, she effectively with Miumi Hinata voiced by Yuuka Aisaka during the early episodes of the anime developing Saya, but Aoi&#039;s role was pretty much is a proxy &quot;final boss&quot; and although the true &quot;final boss&quot; really comes outta nowhere, it for LA just meant that Aoi&#039;s role diminished quickly as her villainy (and Shizuka Ito&#039;s hamminess and just LOVING IT by the way) was a shame, but nonetheless helping to Saya&#039;s other character development of &quot;friendship&quot; for her and the anime&#039;s finale. The best character development character really goes to Saya as even after her development episodes finishes, she really becomes the glue that makes her group of friends stronger and she helps resolve their problems, be it indirectly or not and Saya changes quite quickly from an annoying whiny character to a pillar of support of the main good cast and she too develops along with other characters, it even got to the point that even her &quot;group&quot; wants her, no seriously Almaria and eventually the majority of her &quot;friends&quot; becomes infatuated with Saya once their arcs concludes...(as well as other characters relationship which is blatant *cough* Carene &amp; Xenia *cough*)...the yuri undertones in this anime gets strong pretty quick for that reason alone. The least developed character really goes to Amane ironically, sure she still appears in the anime &quot;after the dark turn&quot; in the form of flashbacks, but she along with Saya is more to develop the &quot;certain character in their arc&quot; more than anything. The character development is slightly all over the place even if it is focused on a certain character but LA thinks that the character development is one of the more strong points to Ange Vierge even as corny of a meaning behind the character arcs were.<br />
<br />
The voice acting with THIS huge voice cast line up, LA is in voice acting heaven with this anime, LA will more or less focus on one or two voice actors with this anime however, as the rest of the voice actors, they did pretty decently. So which voice actor is LA gonna focus on, Minako Kotobuki as Saya and Shizuka Ito as Aoi. Minako Kotobuki had a rather rocky start in voicing Saya mainly due to her whininess during the start, but as Saya gradually developed and her whininess disappeared with her involvement with the other main characters, Minako Kotobuki got better and it made more sense as Saya had the most screentime overall. Shizuka Ito, what can LA say, LA just knew that Shizuka Ito just loved hamming it up in voicing a villainous character and seriously all due to her hamminess, Shizuka Ito was a clear favourite for LA&#039;s favourite voice actor, with Yumi Hara as Almaria coming in in second. <br />
<br />
The ending was pretty grand and LA was greatly satisfied by it with nearly the entire cast helped with this &quot;final battle&quot; as well as FINALLY bringing Amane herself her own character development as well as Saya and sure the finale &quot;fixed everything&quot; from taking care of the threat, but LA didn&#039;t care...this ending had a great payoff, the build up of the character development of Amane&#039;s group cast members helped it immensely and they really went all out with the final battle.<br />
<br />
Ange Vierge is a guilty pleasure anime as it does strike some of the boxes to make it manageable to watch and not as aggravating with all it&#039;s faults that LA listed above as this anime is focused for the better part of the anime as it goes along, it&#039;s character development is a welcome sign to get invested in some of the main good characters and although this is a mobile card game anime adaptation, Ange Vierge being on the nose about it helped LA get invested albeit with LA&#039;s prediction goggles on. LA gets its not the anime for everyone, hell the first episode is enough to get the non-ecchi anime fans to run for the hills, but for a bareboned anime about a literal mobile card game where characters are trying to evolve to their next rank by trying to de-brainwash their far superior ranked friends...LA still liked Ange Vierge flaws and fanservice and all.

 Edit 1: Ok guys, just for your information, ange vierge is produced by silver link...<br />
<br />
silver link? who are they?<br />
<br />
The producers of awesome animes such as Non Non biyori, Baka to test, Watamote and Tasogare Otome x Amnesia. <br />
<br />
Sounds awesome right, you are expecting something great from them.....right?<br />
<br />
/<br />
<br />
In this review i will talk aobut the ending, so sadly there is spoilers, but ONLY at the end of my review,  because its all about the ending, and it need to be explained.  sorry guys.<br />
<br />
This anime is classic, nothing awesome that you will never forget but its just a little piece of nice anime...

          <span style="display: none;" id="review232476">
        but the ending ruined everything.<br />
<br />
The chars are kinda good, but not remarkable, its kinda classic but the chars are cute so it&#039;s okay for me. I hate the main character, Saya, for both what is she doing and what she done. Unappealing main char. Her design is too classic.<br />
<br />
<br />
Both art and music are great, i loved the musics of the EP12. Really good melody, use of instruments, i didn&#039;t liked the OP tho, classic and boring.<br />
<br />
<br />
The art fits the anime, a bit classic but beautiful... until the end. Art isn&#039;t everything for a good anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
The story itself is... something that push you to look at it.  Sadly its kinda predictable, exept for 2-3 things on the anime otherwise you can know what&#039;s gonna happen next. The story is rushed as well, you can&#039;t end this anime with only 12 episodes.<br />
<br />
So if you plan to watch this one, just end at the 11th episode.<br />
<br />
If i can describe this anime with one word... it would be: Disapointement.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
+good music<br />
+Good art<br />
+Nya is best waifu<br />
+Cute angels<br />
+Kinda good comedy, had a tiny bit of laugh sometimes<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
-Lame story, almost boring<br />
-Stupid ending, insulting, unbearable story. Almost the middle finger.<br />
-You don&#039;t really care about the chars<br />
-Yes we get it saya you are the main char and you want to be special to... for what? being special? k<br />
-Why is there only girls!? AGAIN?<br />
<br />
<br />
/<br />
<br />
Edit 1: hold on... <br />
<br />
Silver Link made Baka to test,  Non non biyori, watamote and Tasogare Otome x Amnesia!?<br />
<br />
I just have one word: UNACCEPTABLE!.<br />
<br />
 Those animes are just GREAT, awesome, perfection, they are capable to make great animes, great stories and awesome characters that you will remember, even the jokes, and the slice of life of those animes are just beyond awesomeness!<br />
<br />
SO WHY DID THEY MADE THIS!? in what purpose they make a generic and boring anime like that!? comon! they can do better! jesus christ i did not exept such a good producer to make such a crapy anime...<br />
<br />
<br />
/<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
/!\ SPOILERS ZONE, please take your safety jacket because we are going down /!\<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The ending felt wrong, so god damm wrong. And this is why i give it a poor 4, because the art and sound was really awesome... otherwise i would have gave it a 6.<br />
<br />
But jesus christ the ending...<br />
<br />
It talks about a extremely serious topic, and they f*cked up.<br />
<br />
They obviously don&#039;t know what does it feels to be &quot;that&quot; alone, even with people around, being transparent without everyone taking a single care of you.<br />
<br />
they obviously couldn&#039;t understand that being stuck on their own &quot;spirit&quot; for.... THE ENTIRE ANIME? (wich means errr... 1week I guess? timelapse is weird as well.)... could lead to serious thoughts, over and over again? And what is it with this huuuuuuuuge cliff? why is she at the edge? what could have been meant here?<br />
<br />
The classic, &quot;but we are your friends, we didn&#039;t understand at first but we get it when you weren&#039;t here&quot;, pisses me off, its such a LAME excuse, a insulting excuse.<br />
<br />
But ok, its anime, its not real life, alright i get it... but when she is finaly free...<br />
Why is she smiling? Why does the say &quot;good job&quot; to saya? It just DOESN&#039;T work like that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and, the classic &quot;everyone come back to fight a godlike ennemy but the main char rekt everyone anyway&quot; ending is both awful and boring as well... hold on did she One Shoted absolutly everything with ONE ATTACK!?<br />
<br />
Did they won? is the world at peace? its not the only ennemy right? why does it end like that?<br />
<br />
No. the EP12 ruined the entire anime for me, it could have been great, but talking about topics like &quot;friends&quot;, &quot;beging alone&quot;, &quot;wanted to be someone special&quot; and &quot;end of the world&quot;  require KNOWLEDGE. Its not friendship is magic, its a serious anime, it talks about END OF THE WORLD and you just end it with a &quot;yeah dude we like you please come back&quot; and &quot;Main character one shot everything with the &quot;unlimited power of being herrself&quot;&quot;? no, thank you sir.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good anime potential, extremely rushed story (one episode for each world?! really?) <br />
<br />
an insulting ending, almost the middle finger.<br />
<br />
<br />
6.75/10 until the 12th episode, then 4/10. disapointement is the word for this anime. <br />
<br />
UNACEPTABLE is the word for silver link. drop it to a solid 2/10 since they made awesome animes, they have no excuse.<br />
<br />
Edit overall: 3/10 (droped to 4/10 since its silver link and because its a huge insult, such a bad story, char developement, rushed anime, bad ending shouldn&#039;t hapening with silver link.)<br />

    What happens when someone with poor long term memory, terrible understanding of science and abysmal skill in math decides to make sci-fi anime? Ange Vierge. Based on a card game? Unfortunately yes, which goes a long way to explain the amazingly dumb plot.<br />
<br />
What you should expect is an endless stream of nude teen girls, occasionally interrupted by incredibly dumb nonsense about ending a bunch of worlds and shallow &quot;insights&quot; in social interaction that most of us had a handle on in elementary school. That&#039;s the entire anime right there, not a single thing worth mentioning beyond it.  I love nude teen girls but not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258947">
        even that can save this show, it doesn&#039;t even influence the score I&#039;m willing to give. That score is almost entirely based on the good visual and audio quality, things completely wasted on this anime.

    First of all, I had high hopes for this anime. My first thoughts were like this. Some badass girls from different worlds fighting against a common enemy who wants (yeah you guessed it right!) destroy them. All of them got awesome powers, there is no male character to see, maybe some drama and a good yuri romance who knows? Well, nope, nope, nope!!!<br />
<br />
It&#039;s sad, because they could easily make it a good story. You&#039;ve got everything you&#039;ve got, but in the end you kinda disappointed me.<br />
<br />
Still, I will be fair it isn&#039;t ALL bad! The opening song is awesome, the fighting scenes are nice enough

          <span style="display: none;" id="review231144">
        and different with each character. They all got to express their own little story and reasons in an episode or two. <br />
<br />
But no real romance, just some hugging and naked girls in a bath (most of the time actually...) If you want you can divide this anime in 3 pieces: one the fighting, two the bath scenes and last a little bit of drama/past scenes. Sad isn&#039;t it?<br />
<br />
Overall, it was fine. But sadly nothing more. If you want naked girls and a little bit of yuri on the side, this anime is the right thing for you! Over and out captain!<br />

    This anime I felt was over all good. The plot was confusing at times when going into character backstories and then to the present. However the episodes were consistent when focusing on one character. Unlike in longer anime how 5-10 eps can be about one character or sub plot. There are also some really funny moments which break up the serious plot and character growth which adds to the enjoyment.<br />
<br />
As for the art it very colorful and yet was able to maintain a sense of realism. And the characters all have different reasons for why they are the way they are which is explained and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review273464">
        in a way resolved so you don&#039;t get that unresolved feeling. <br />
<br />
*Please note there was a LOT of fanservice (bath) just so you know.

    Story: 6 / Character: 6 / Enjoyment: 8<br />
Overall: 6<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not terrible, even if it really should be.  I can&#039;t take any of it seriously.  You&#039;re probably not supposed to though.<br />
This is an anime based on a TCG and it shows in the story.  Much of the faults in the story and characters seem to track back to that, they have to work with the source material even if it&#039;s not suitable.<br />
<br />
If you can overlook the fact that the show regularly makes no sense, it&#039;s actually worth watching.<br />
<br />
You know, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s ever explained how the Progress without wings are able to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review231914">
        fly.  Nya kinda makes sense, but Saya has no excuse at all.<br />
<br />
There are definitely some good bits...<br />
- Amane-chan... she&#039;s almost a good enough reason to watch this by herself.  Moe factor 10 engaged!  Comedy value off the scale.<br />
- Alma ... a vampire who doesn&#039;t like drinking blood because she feels it&#039;s too intimate.  It doesn&#039;t get old, really doesn&#039;t.  Sex jokes for days.<br />
- If you like yuri you&#039;ll be in heaven.  I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a single male character on screen for longer an a couple of seconds and that gives us lots of girls to be cute.  As you might expect, more than half of them turn out to have a strong attraction for one of the others.  Weirdly, most of the character progression seems to involve increasing the yuri vibe.<br />
- The Green World sisters.  Starting episode 4, you get at least one comedy inserts from them each episode.  It has nothing to do with the plot but they&#039;re absolutely hilarious.  The two C-class helpers are also funny but they don&#039;t get as much screen time.  The obviousness of some of the jokes doesn&#039;t diminish the comedy value at all.<br />
- The &quot;5 worlds&quot; plot point is helpful in providing some varied environments.  It&#039;s handy to have an excuse to vary things up like that without it feeling contrived.<br />
- Being so hard to take seriously also means you don&#039;t have to think too hard... this is a good binge watch you don&#039;t have to worry about.<br />
- The art style regularly drops to a less serious style that actually seems to help.<br />
<br />
Basic summary goes something like this...<br />
<br />
For never adequately explained reasons, the world is under attack by faceless enemy robots who are using unexplained plot powers to destroy the known worlds for no readily apparent reason.<br />
<br />
The first big battle turns out to be a trap that should have been a painfully obvious, that everyone falls for anyway.  Our main protagonists survive the disaster that knocks out every other useful Progress largely on account of how terrible they are at doing their one main job.<br />
It&#039;s now left largely to our dysfunctional hero team to save the worlds from inevitable doom.  Along the way we get a healthy dose of exposition and character flaw fixing.  We also discover that defeating the enemy involves vaporising their clothes for some reason.<br />
It&#039;s heavily implied through out the series that the enemy attacks are mostly just to entertain the enemy ... if they&#039;d done just the first and last attacks they&#039;d have been bored but victorious.  Yeah, go figure.<br />
<br />
By the end they&#039;re considerably less dysfunctional and it&#039;s time for the show down, at which point a bunch of &quot;oh come on, seriously?&quot; moments occur and someone uses a Sega Dreamcast to save the world (I&#039;m not kidding).<br />
The curtain comes down and we&#039;ve still got a lot of unanswered questions, and we still don&#039;t quite understand what the bad guys are getting out of it, but it looks like all the good guys are safe.<br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
<br />
It definitely has it&#039;s moments but I can&#039;t rate it highly.  Most of the time it&#039;s actually a 7.5 regularly jumping to 8, I&#039;m docking it heavily because this really should be subtitled &quot;The conveniently placed cloud and light bloom show!&quot;<br />
<br />
Let me explain, see how it&#039;s rated for &quot;Mild nudity&quot;?  Yeah, that&#039;s total nonsense.<br />
See, these girls have two main modes, &quot;World saving&quot; and &quot;Hanging around naked&quot;.  They spend most of their time doing one or the other, and since there&#039;s only so much time you can spend fighting they tend to spend most of their time naked.<br />
To avoid a more serious nudity rating they use a lot of conveniently placed obstructions but failing that, there&#039;s clouds and light beams that obscure their fun bits along with a pretty large chunk of the rest of the shot.  Urg.<br />
I rather hope they release an uncensored version, just because getting rid of the light beams would make the whole thing easier to watch :(  This is a case where nudity isn&#039;t a good thing.<br />
<br />
Sound: 3<br />
<br />
Some of the voice acting sounds annoyingly similar, but no, this shows gets a low mark for one simple reason: Why does Stella sound like a petrol engine when she&#039;s flying around using some kind of jet engine?  That single atrocious choice of sound effect gets the series a 3.<br />
<br />
I also have a gripe about the annoying line in the OP (Love is MY RAIL) where she&#039;s had to stuff so much in to a single line that it sounds like they slowed down the song just to fit it in, but otherwise the OP and ED fit the show reasonably well.  They&#039;re not overly flashy but get the job done, which is what you want if you don&#039;t want to distract too much from the show.  I&#039;m going to over look how it sounds like she sings &quot;Love is my lane&quot;.<br />
<br />
The heavy use of 10-codes is gets old, but eh, what can you do in a military setting.
