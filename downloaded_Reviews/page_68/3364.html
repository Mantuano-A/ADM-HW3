    I read the manga version few years ago but dropped it eventually because of how annoying the characters were - especially Erika.<br />
I was actually surprised that it was adapted into anime. One day, I saw a video on youtube for &quot;top best shoujo anime of all time&quot; and this anime was included, so I decided to give it a try, which I regretted A LOT.<br />
Before you watch this anime, please search and read the difference between S&amp;M relationship and an abusive relationship - because there is a big difference.<br />
<br />
Story: 1/10<br />
What does this anime even want us to learn?<br />
That it&#039;s okay to lie and let yourself

          <span style="display: none;" id="review207205">
        be treated like an animal for the sake of getting along with your friends, because they will eventually like you?<br />
That it&#039;s okay to lie and let the man you love, humiliate you and treat you like an animal because he will eventually fall for you?<br />
That it&#039;s okay to endure everything because of love?<br />
No wonder there are so many women who choose to stay in an abusive relationship with the reasons: &quot; I love him, he will change somehow&quot; - or is this really what this anime wanted us to learn? - that it&#039;s okay to be treated like an animal and endure it all because they will eventually change and fall for you.<br />
<br />
Art: 5/10<br />
The art okay is just okay. There were times when the anime looks dull but most of the time it&#039;s just okay.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10<br />
Not that really catchy for me.<br />
<br />
Character: 1/10<br />
Erika: The main character of this series - she is very very annoying, especially at the start of the series. There were lots of times when I really want to slap her just to make her back to her senses. I didn&#039;t see anything good about her character - first, she lied to her friends about having a boyfriend, took a picture of someone she doesn&#039;t even know and used it as a proof and lied about it to her friends just so, she have something to &quot;show off&quot;. Then out of desperation to keep her lies: she agreed to become his &quot;pet&quot; - all because she was desperate to get along with her friends who obviously are no good for her. Then fell for the man who treated her like an animal and endured all of his abuses, simply because &quot;she loves him&quot;<br />
<br />
Sata: At first, I thought he looked liked Gintoki (lol). He is your usual &quot;Handsome, popular but rude male lead who have a sad past&quot; - the author wanted to give him a sad past to justified his actions, but for me, that reason wasn&#039;t really bad enough for him to end up like that- for me, he is nothing but a weak and emo spoiled brat.<br />
<br />
Overall: 1/10<br />
Even though I am anemic, watching this anime made me feel like I am going to have a high blood pressure. The story is no good and the characters are pathetic and annoying. Some says that, this is like an S&amp;M relationship, which I don&#039;t really agree with.<br />
<br />

    Before watching this show, I&#039;d recommend you Wiki-up on the term known as &quot;Stockholm syndrome&quot;. It will help you understand the ultimate wrong aspect of this anime far better, but, unfortunately, it still won&#039;t ease the fact that this anime is completely and utterly average. <br />
<br />
The story is really simple and there isn&#039;t much to it: the girl joins high school, wants to make friends, lies to them about having a boyfriend, turns out that her made-up boyfriend goes to same school with her and is quite popular, he for some reason agrees to go along with her charade and then their adventures begin. I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178371">
        can&#039;t say much for the story because there isn&#039;t any really. As a mainly character-driven series, the story is put-off into the sidelines and has trouble pacing itself over the episodes. At times, the episodes skip months worth of content they could show, and, for some reason, literally nothing seemed to have changed. I won&#039;t detail it out because it might be a spoiler, but you&#039;ll understand, trust me. The reason I gave the story such a low score is that even what&#039;s there isn&#039;t that good. It&#039;s predictable and filled with cliches and doesn&#039;t really work as a whole on any level. <br />
<br />
Production of the show is its strongest part, alongside the comedy, and is quite eye-catchy. Especially for girl viewers. Even though there are some cute girls, most of them are not really THAT cute, while most of the guys that are important are made out to be quite hot - hence, extremely impossible to relate to just off the basis of the art. Animation hinges on the simplicity of movement and not much else and the series as a whole doesn&#039;t really have any heavy scenes when it comes to either art or sound. Speaking of sound, I had a really hard time hearing any music during this anime. For some reason, nothing stuck out and for the most part I didn&#039;t even bother looking for it. Voice actors did their jobs decently, but nothing really spectacular there either.<br />
<br />
Now, I expect you have looked up what I asked you to, so I can continue with my depiction of the characters in this show. We have Erika, our main girl, who desperately wants to fit in into high school and lies through her teeth to do so. I can relate to that and, probably, most people who&#039;ve gone through high school can. What differs us, normal humans, from her is simply how far she&#039;s willing to push her lie. It goes bounds and leaps beyond what any sane human, who isn&#039;t riddle with any mental illness, would do. While the show puts it all on &quot;extreme masochism&quot;, it&#039;s not. It can&#039;t be. You can&#039;t give such a vague attribute to your character and expect all her actions to make sense. Regardless of what Sato did to her, she came running back. Regardless of how much he&#039;d hurt her, she came running back. It&#039;s not masochism - not even a form of it. It can be only explained as a complete and utter mental illness and, to be honest, show should have been about her going to the shrink and fixing it. Aside from that trait, she&#039;s not that interesting to watch. She&#039;s kind of likable, I guess,  and is shown to be a pathological liar although I&#039;m pretty sure that whoever wrote this story really shouldn&#039;t attribute any mental illnesses to his/hers characters ever again because they have no basic idea what they are.<br />
<br />
Next up we have Sata, extreme version of male-tsundere. I&#039;m going to say it upfront: nobody will ever relate to this character. And if you do, you are a horrible human being and you should know it. He lacks any likable traits, and I&#039;d be fine with that if those unlikable traits were realistic. He&#039;s also showcased as sadist, but, again, I&#039;m pretty sure that whoever wrote this doesn&#039;t understand what that means. He often says that he doesn&#039;t do it because he likes to, but still does it, which kind of contradicts the entire premise of the sadist. Instead, 90% of the things he says are intended to hurt the other party, and not in a sarcastic and funny way. Calling someone a dog over and over and over again, shunning the other people&#039;s emotions, dragging them along, doing things that go far beyond simple bullying - that&#039;s the kind of character Sata is. <br />
<br />
[MINOR SPOILER]<br />
There&#039;s a certain scene midway through the anime where Erika and Sata are sitting alone in a coffee shop and she asks him what he thinks of her. He then proceeds to tell her how much he likes her and turns it over by the end. Her reaction is okay, I guess, but what&#039;s the point of this is that it really showcased just how shallow, uninteresting and borderline insane character Sata is.<br />
[/MINOR SPOILER END]<br />
<br />
This goes for the majority of the characters: all of them (aside from 1 or 2 maybe) seem to be suffering from some sort of a pathological illness, or they&#039;re just really, really, really stupid. I won&#039;t describe any more because they aren&#039;t really worth the page. <br />
<br />
Did I enjoy the anime? Relatively, to be honest, hence this high of a score for all the bashing. Humor, for the most part, was well done and the show did make me laugh out loud a couple of times, but that was about it. Romance is shallow, insane and simply unrealistic, and the &#039;drama&#039; moments are worth less than those of Clannad. <br />
<br />
All in all, unless you just want to fill your list with rom-coms, I&#039;d stay away from this. Especially if you&#039;re looking for likable and relate-able characters.

    A desire for acceptance is something that most of us can relate to, and at times that can drive us to certain extremes. It&#039;s a premise that is not necessarily unique, but for a shoujo series it actually is. The cliched trope of a spineless heroine and her tsundere love interest is all too common. However this series provides us with a slight variant; our main character is a compulsive liar with a penchant for emotional punishment (read: she&#039;s a masochist) that happens to, in a series of poor decisions and bad judgment, land herself a two-faced jerk who is content to treat her like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173547">
        a dog.<br />
<br />
Originality is not this anime&#039;s forte, per se, but it is successful as a romantic comedy because it is uncommon. The two main leads seem initially very unlikeable, but if you accept the fact that they mutually (consensually) engage in something of a sadomasochistic relationship—that neither one seems to want to disband even when given the chance—then the series provides some amusing comedy.<br />
<br />
Erika is not your traditional shoujo heroine, she&#039;s actually a plucky, resilient lead who for reasons unbeknownst to most viewers, seems to enjoy Kyouya&#039;s treatment. When situations arise that would stereotypically end in an angst-filled fight between our couple, Erika maintains her usual headstrong, blind determination to win over her ice-hearted prince. She does actually develop as the series progresses, because initially his treatment of her does seem to bring her spirits down, yet she rather quickly begins to learn just how Kyouya works and how outwardly dishonest he is—and she adapts.<br />
<br />
Kyouya is perhaps less impressive on the face of things, but the amusing reality is that he&#039;s not like your traditional tsundere love interest in that he doesn&#039;t have much in the way of redeeming qualities. He is, quite frankly, a jerk to Erika constantly and only occasionally showers her with some vague form of affection. But the series doesn&#039;t try too hard to redeem him—he has no sad backstory to fall on, as he says himself. His behavior is not entirely without cause, given the influence of his older sister. Being cynical and misanthropic seems to run in the family.<br />
<br />
The supporting cast is entertaining albeit peripheral, and they receive minimal attention or development. That is a disappointing fact about the series, which was limited in how much screen time it could offer them given its short runtime. But for their part in the series, they did contribute to the development of the main couple and to the overall humor of their antics.<br />
<br />
For the part of the plot, there is nothing original in the least—it is the traditional shoujo setup from the beginning until the end. What pulls it off in a unique way is the characters that are seemingly cliche but vary quite drastically from any traditional leads in a romance series. They carry the series where the plot might otherwise flop for not being terribly thought provoking or entertaining. It&#039;s the same old setup, but delivered in a way that can still rouse some amusement because the way everything plays out seems bland at first but the spice of the characters bring it some flavor.<br />
<br />
In regards to the animation, the color palette is vibrant and charming. In comparison to the manga, it actually has adapted all of the character designs quite nicely and all of the scenes have at least done justice to or provided some improvement on their counterpart. Although it is like any other shoujo style, each design is unique and rather fitting giving each character&#039;s unique persona.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately another weak area is perhaps the soundtrack. The opening is catchy and adorable, but during the course of the series there are a few scenes with background music that just seem utterly out of place in an almost comedic sense. In general, the series doesn&#039;t suffer too much in this category—at least not too noticeably, but it does lack the ability to match its own mood properly at certain moments.<br />
<br />
Overall, the series has enough merits to warrant it being a good shoujo anime. Although this review may lead you to believe that the main characters are the most redeeming part of the series, it would be disingenuous to claim they aren&#039;t the least bit frustrating. If you have difficulty appreciating that they are more nuanced than they seem at first glance, then you will be hard pressed to find anything enjoyable about the series. This certainly is not for everyone, it&#039;s not about a sweet couple that fall in love gradually—it&#039;s about two characters who are so entirely human that they are flawed and utterly unlikeable, but as a result of which, happen to be highly entertaining together.

    To begin, you should all know that I hate anime where the female protagonist bends over backwards to gather whatever crumbs of affection a cold, asshole of a male lead deigns to toss her way (I&#039;m looking at you Itazura na Kiss).<br />
<br />
That being said, there are exceptions to every rule; and I guess I found mine in Ookami Shoujo to Kuroouji. Part of my fondness for this anime could be that there seems to be a shoujo anime drought going on. But I digress, so without further ado, let me review.<br />
<br />
Ookami Shoujo to Kuroouji is a twelve episode romcom and a predictably predictable shoujo formula.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review188864">
        But I wouldn&#039;t say that it&#039;s a bad thing. <br />
<br />
The story begins with an intro to our heroine Shinohara Erika. A typical bubbly and dense heroine who dreams of experiencing the fabled &quot;high school life&quot;. A wrench is thrown into Erika&#039;s plans when she is separated from her best friend and they are placed in different classes. This is where Erika reveals a quirk that sets her apart from other shoujo heroines. <br />
She is a compulsive liar. In order to fit in with her classmates, Marin and Tezuka, with whom she has little in common, Erika makes up a boyfriend to give her something to talk about with them.<br />
Her lie unfortunately only worked short-term. Her friends are beginning to sense the truth and Erika&#039;s cried wolf (or in this case, boyfriend) a little too loud, and a little too often to backtrack now. To reinforce her lie Erika takes a picture of a hot guy on the street and passes him off as her boyfriend. Too late, Erika finds out that the hot guy is actually a student at her school, Sata Kyouya. Erika asks him to pretend to be her boyfriend, thinking he will agree because he is such a prince, or whatever. And he does. On the condition that she be his dog.<br />
<br />
So Sata-kun turns out to be an evil sadist and Erika his hapless victim, who inevitably falls in love with him because he was nice a couple times. And if the series continued on in this vein, this review would be a lot more scathing. It turns itself around at episode 6.<br />
<br />
Erika does the usual thing where she &quot;works hard&quot; to win Kyouya&#039;s love but admits she gets tired when she does all the chasing with little reciprocation, and that she gets humiliated by him time and again. <br />
<br />
Kyouya is a bit more complicated than your average male lead in that his popular, friendly personality is a complete lie. Later in the series one realizes his personality is more like that of a bitter, introverted loner (Hachiman Hikigaya, anyone?)<br />
<br />
The best part of this show for me was seeing the two protagonists change because of their involvement with each other. Kyouya is less sadist and more tsundere. And it&#039;s adorable to watch him struggle to express his affection for Erika (which definitely becomes more apparent) and break through the barriers he&#039;s created to keep people at bay. Erika can be a little hard to take at times, but she was strong when it counted, and refreshingly forward. In the end I understood her determination to win Kyouya. After all, the bigger they are, the harder they fall. And it was supremely satisfying watching Kyouya fall. <br />
<br />
The art in the show is clean with nice colour and is very, very shoujo.<br />
<br />
The sound was fine, not outstanding except for the punchy and unusual theme song. Sort of like a Japanese Avril Lavigne, I listened to it everytime, which is quite unusual for me. <br />
<br />
This show had cringeworthy moments, but also had genuinely funny and sweet ones too. <br />
<br />
When you&#039;re suffering from drought, any refreshment is welcome, and Ookami Shoujo to Kuroouji quenched my thirst.

    Ever heard of the phrase ‘don’t bite off more than you can chew?’ Figuratively speaking, if you get a plain girl aiming for that dream guy, then that’s more than what they can ask for. Meet Erika, the main female protagonist of this series who is exactly the plain girl. Then, we have the dream guy named Kyouya Sata. With those princely like looks, it’s no wonder every girl wants to be his girlfriend. However, this show isn’t about a perfect romantic get-away with these two. No, it’s far from that. Wolf Girl (Erika) and Black Prince (Sata) unites two characters in a story of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173585">
        drama, abuse, and teenage youth by two complete opposite strangers.<br />
<br />
As a standard shoujo series, Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji (Wolf Girl and Black Prince) is pretty generic from the get-go. It takes place in a school life setting where drama ensures. And judging by the ages of the characters, most of the girls seems to be interested in boys. No exception comes with Erika as she wants to a boyfriend, or at least someone to brag about. The funny part is that she ends up getting more than what she bargains for: Kyouya Sata. The first few episode depicts their awkward encounter that eventually gets her into a “relationship” with the guy. The quotation means that their relationship is fake although is used as a mask by Erika to prove her accomplishment of snatching the hottest guy at school. The picture isn’t really pretty from behind the scenes though. Sata is more or less so the type of jerk where he cares about nothing but himself. Actually, his action implies himself as a sadist who rejects romance and wants Erika as her servant/dog. It’s silly on the forefront and completely unexpected for someone like Erika. By some point, would you feel sorry for her? Perhaps but it’s her problem to deal with now.<br />
<br />
The series explains the problems that goes on between Erika and Sata. From the beginning, Erika must somehow always maintain the posture that they are dating as a couple rather than being labeled as frauds. Several instances throughout the series lands them in cliché misunderstandings where their relationship become close to being jeopardized. While this is seen in many shoujo series, this anime goes into diehard mode to let the audience know exactly the type of person Sata is. At some point, you might genuinely feel sorry for Erika. However, there’s also cases where we see a different side of Sata, one which we realize he might not be the bad boy he tries to be. Examples include situations where Erika gets into real trouble and Sata has to save the day. Also throughout the series, it’s heavily implied that Sata develops real feelings for Erika and vice versa. As a controlling boyfriend though, Sata is one of those guys that is hard to please. Unfortunately, Erika is usually on the receiving end of punishments that lands her into even more trouble.<br />
<br />
As for Erika herself, there’s development for her character. At first, she often cares about what other people thinks and does anything to establish a reputation. Because let’s face it, high school is about making an impact and youth really accelerates when you meet that special someone. Erika experiences this first hand later on when she realizes that special someone could actually be Sata. The question comes to matter is how far she is willing to go for Sata. At various times, she realizes that there may or may not be a way to change Sata. That isn’t really the point anyways since the show focuses a lot more on their relationship rather than see who can change who. On an even more frustrating note, we don’t really know much about Sata’s past in regards to his background story. For a guy with such reputation at school, there’s only very few that knows the real him.<br />
<br />
Relationships can be a nutshell when other characters gets involved. And like many other shoujo series, we do have side characters that complicates Erika and Sata’s relationship. If the first two words that come to your mind are ‘love rivals’, then you are correct. As predictable as it can be, the show introduces both male and female characters as a seemingly way to test how Erika or Sata can cope when someone else asks them out. Characters introduced in the series ranges from shy loners to playboys. You can just imagine how this can influence their relationship when a misunderstanding between them can go out of hand. A problem with this is how the show neglects their relationship building but instead focuses on how they deal with it separately. Not only that but the comedy faded as well when certain situations become serious. Luckily, a good deal of the show has comedy, a factor that makes the series quite entertaining. There’s no denying that there’s comedy when it comes to this show whether it’s be Sata’s constant abuse or Erika’s life. Still, when the story gets on the melancholic side with what it has built, then the series suffers from momentum. The plus side is that comedy is present in good doses throughout the series when there’s opportunity. Timing is key and the show does nail that on most parts whether it’d be Sata’s taunts, zany imaginations, or anything you may see related in a couple who are nothing alike to each other.<br />
<br />
For this particular shoujo series, the artwork would be labeled as average at best. The characters are designed with stereotypes with no particular character standing out above the others. Some noticeable features are probably Sata and his reactions that can strike as comedy gold. Otherwise, don’t expect some high quality delivery from this series when it comes to artwork or visuals. The background, settings, and character designs is a bad joke itself with uninspired effort.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack is more or less of an interest to take notice. I say this because of the character voice mannerisms, a trait that is actually quite important for the main characters. This is especially true for Sata as he hides his true character. I do give him some credit for his tone of voice when he is able to quickly shift between the prince charming to the controlling master. On the other hand, Erika can sound like a child at times when she complains. It gets tiresome and frustrating when the series continues to recycle her personality over and over to express it in audio scenarios. Otherwise, the OP and ED songs are amusing to watch not because of the lyrics but the coordination of the scenes. Like I mentioned before, comedy plays out a large part of this show’s entertainment so those songs hit the right notes.<br />
<br />
At its core, Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji is like a test to see how far Sata and Erika will score as a couple by the end of the show. I don’t mean it literally as this show’s score but rather their relationship and its development. To say the least, it is a mixed bag with obstacles and challenges. However, the show knows its intentions and highlights that with plenty of opportunities to make the audience laugh. It may not be a stand-up comedy but the show has that enthralling grip when it does try. Just be aware that the show is nothing less than predictable, conventional, and saturated with the usual moments that may make you go ‘been there, done that’.<br />

    Wolf Girl &amp; Black Prince is a really sad excuse for a romance anime, doing for romantic comedy what Twilight did for teenage relationships and taking it a step further to S&amp;M. <br />
<br />
Wolf Girl &amp; Black Prince is about Erika Shinohara, a 16-year-old girl who finds herself starting a new year of school, but is alienated from the other students because they have all formed their own cliques. In order to befriend two girls, she tells them about her romantic exploits with her boyfriend, despite the fact she has no boyfriend.<br />
<br />
She claims that a handsome boy in a candid photo is her boyfriend, unaware that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180580">
        he is her schoolmate, Kyouya Sata. In order to hide her lie, she asks him to keep her secret and he offers to become her fake boyfriend. Unfortunately for her, while Sata acts like a sweet person in public, he is actually a black-hearted sadist, and blackmails her into becoming his dog. <br />
<br />
Right off the bat, Wolf Girl is very bright and colorful, but the overall art is lacking, as most of the detail went into the male characters, mainly Kyouya, causing the others to pale in comparison. You&#039;ll notice that throughout the show the colors on Kyouya Sata just pop, but when the scene flips over to Erika, the same attention to detail is absent. <br />
<br />
The sound is barely sub-par and pretty average as far as shoujo anime go.  It&#039;s also too sharp of a contrast to the dark subject matter, and the opening theme feels like its trying to romanticize the story into something positive even though it isn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
Character development-wise, there is some progression, though slow, with background on Kyouya to illuminate the viewers on why he&#039;s such a flaming douchebag. Yet again, a whole lot of focus on the male lead, which doesn&#039;t leave much room for the other characters to grow in the story. But several episodes in and the side characters make so few appearances they become generic plot devices anyway.<br />
<br />
The entire storyline is chock full of drama, with power play and S&amp;M fleshed out across the whole series. Kyouya takes up almost all the limelight and character development, accounting for a huge chunk of each of the 12 installments. And because he&#039;s such convincing eye-candy, you don&#039;t notice you&#039;re wasting your life watching him hog screen time just so he can be an asshole to a teenage girl. <br />
<br />
As a whole, Kyouya&#039;s entire personality detracts from his character, making him creepy and off-putting. His entire relationship with Erika from the beginning is founded on the basis for control, or put more simply, because he wants a dog he can order around. But that&#039;s about where things stop being funny. Kyouya&#039;s obsession with having power over her leads him to push the boundaries of what is acceptable, even going as far as to emotionally toy with Erika in increasingly cruel ways even when she bares her emotions to him.<br />
<br />
This twisted rendition of a master/slave relationship ultimately personifies an abusive relationship and the death of feminism all in one series. If that was what the creators were going for, they hit two birds with one stone.<br />
<br />
But seriously, who wants a heroine who just lets herself get walked all over and then comes back for more?<br />
<br />
Wolf Girl &amp; Black Prince tries to be lighthearted about the delicate subject matter, but its dark undertones make the whole relationship between Erika and Sata seem deeply disturbing. <br />
<br />
Even in light of the fact the anime tries to excuse Kyouya&#039;s behavior with his past, it doesn&#039;t do much in the way of rectifying all the torment he inflicted on Erika, nor does it convince me that all is okay. In the end, Kyouya&#039;s actions defy logic by bringing Erika closer instead of destroying their relationship. <br />
<br />
Sadly, the one character is not Wolf Girl&#039;s only flaw. The amount of female subordination to boot is appalling. Erika Shinohara proves to be as dumb as she is naive, excusing Kyouya&#039;s abuse time and again and being bought with acts of fake kindness. <br />
<br />
Somewhere in the story line, a new love prospect opens up for Erika, but she opts out in favor of...you guessed it, Kyouya. <br />
<br />
Unbearably optimistic, Erika&#039;s seiyuu was bubbly and high-pitched to the point of inducing a headache. Kyouya&#039;s seiyuu on the other hand was impressive, but sadly not enough to lift this anime off the ground.<br />
<br />
I honestly wouldn&#039;t even recommend Wolf Girl &amp; Black Prince, unless you&#039;re the type of person who likes watching S&amp;M at its finest. This show calls itself a romance anime, but I was not feeling any love at all from this one.

    1/10  I was on episode 7 or 8, and I was ready to drop it. I just finished it up today, and to be honest, I didn&#039;t enjoy it one bit. It was really a difficult watch. I&#039;m not too fond of the abusive nature of the main male character Kyouya, and the weak-willed personality of the female main, Erika. Actually, I didn&#039;t care for any of the characters in this show. The &quot;teaching moments&quot; in this show felt really forced.<br />
<br />
Kyouya was made be Tsundere character, but, really, this guys shows no change at all - he&#039;s just a jerk, and I don&#039;t think

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181841">
        anyone would take his BS for that amount of time. No matter what, Kyouya treats Erika like she&#039;s a possession, and is not only controlling, but hurts her over an over again, and doesn&#039;t seem to care, and she just accepts it keeps taking the abuse.<br />
<br />
Sure, love can do crazy things, but this is just too much to tolerate. Girls, women, females at any age do not enjoy being treated like that.<br />
<br />
I used to volunteer at women shelters, and I would see this kind of thing all the time. It was heart wrenching to see women who were abused both mentally and physically and still go back.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m told that the manga gets better, but really, I just don&#039;t care to continue this, or explore it further. I&#039;m sorry, I just cannot tolerate to watch the guy absolute torture this girl.<br />
<br />
This anime sends a terrible message to young girls, and boys who think that young girls like this type of guy. WRONG.<br />

    Spoiler warning, just in case you didn&#039;t realize this was a shoujo anime:<br />
<br />
Kyoya is an asshole. BUT ERIKA FALLS IN LOVE WITH HIM ANYWAY!!! I guess you figured this was coming, since it&#039;s a shoujo anime.<br />
<br />
I know that there&#039;s a cross-cultural divide between myself (American) and the story (Japanese), but in no way is it romantic to allow yourself to be abused the way Kyoya abuses Erika. Not to mention that even if he&#039;s only treating her badly because he doesn&#039;t care about her, what&#039;s to say that he&#039;ll stop treating her badly when he actually comes to love her. He basically doesn&#039;t stop treating

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173839">
        her badly, but he does stop treating her like a dog.<br />
<br />
Abuse, turn off number one. Even mild abuse is abuse. She should have walked away sooner, but I guess if she&#039;d walked away, this anime wouldn&#039;t have happened and Kyoya would have just stayed the same as he was.<br />
<br />
Overall, this story is pretty generic. What is it with girls in anime falling for assholes?? And then changing them???<br />
<br />
Can I just say: If you fall in love with someone who is not a great person, you are not going to change them. You&#039;re not going to change anyone you date, and this should not be your goal or mission, because you&#039;re the one who will end up hurt and changed.<br />
<br />
Other than the frankly obnoxious story, the art was decent. They did kind of interesting walking sequences. The sound was good. There was a variety of characters, but not much development as far as I could tell, except in Kyoya. But his development didn&#039;t make much sense to me, for reasons mentioned above.<br />
<br />
I struggled to enjoy the anime taking in to account that Kyoya&#039;s character development didn&#039;t make any sense.<br />
<br />
Overall, I don&#039;t recommend this, unless you&#039;re bored.a

    Demographics can be tricky thing to talk about when talking about anime. They aren&#039;t specific genres, but are more used for targeting specific groups of people. However, just because they are targeting a certain age group and/or gender doesn&#039;t mean those shows are limited to that group of people alone. But in Ookami Shoujo&#039;s case, I firmly believe it the vast majority of people who enjoy this show will be in the shoujo demographic, which is primarily why I found this show mediocre at best.<br />
<br />
The shows first problem for me was came right off the bat. The basic premise of the show is Erika trying

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173487">
        to remain friends with two students by lying that she has a boyfriend, because that her two &quot;friends&quot; basically only talk about their boyfriends. The thing is, those friends are absolute assholes, and even tried to sabotage her &quot;relationship&quot; with Kyoya early on. If Erika was completely friendless, I could, at the very least, understand why she would want to be fake friends with them, but she already has a really good friend in Ayumi to begin with, so one of the major drawing points of the entire show just feels pointless and redundant to me. However, I can only help but feel like I can&#039;t understand Erika&#039;s plight simply because of the whole shoujo demographic thing, and that the whole premise might be much more relatable to actual teenage girls than to me. <br />
<br />
But lets get into the real problem I have with this show. The whole relationship between Kyouya and Erika is more or less completely baseless, and it feels like the actions that led up to the end result made no sense. Kyoya treated Erika like trash, but for some reason, Erika falls in love with him. Kyoya did maybe 5 good things to Erika MAXIMUM throughout months and months of treating her like a dog, and Erika focused solely on those 5 good things that Kyoya did for her, and felt compelled to start an actual relationship with him.  The only real reason Erika and Kyoya got together was because the writers made it so. There was no rhyme or reason for it, no emotional connection, no nothing. Hell, Erika had a chance with this really nice kid, Kusakabe, who actually treated her like a human being, but she turned him down anyways because fuck logic.<br />
<br />
But for all the bashing I have for this show, I&#039;ll give credit where credit is due. For once, an anime showcases a relationship that goes beyond the kiss scene, and shows Erika and Kyoya as a couple. Very few romance anime actually do this, and I did end up enjoying the last few episodes because of this. This doesn&#039;t make up for the fact that their relationship is based off of nothing, but I thought Erika and Kyoya were kind of cute together after they officially became a couple. Sure, this development kind of came out of nowhere, and Kyoya changed drastically personality wise (which is a big plus for his character, but didn&#039;t make much sense to me), but it at least made those last few episodes much more tolerable. <br />
<br />
And then, we have the supporting cast, which really didn&#039;t do much for me. Most of the supporting cast were either nice people, or just plain assholes, with the exception of maybe Nozomi. All the supporting: nice characters, assholes, , were pretty much one note archetypes, even if some of them are different than what we are normally used to. You have your lovable idiot, your playboy, your level-headed best friend, etc. Most of them were more fun to watch than Erika and Kyoya were (which isn&#039;t saying much), but they weren&#039;t much more than that.<br />
<br />
Animation and sound wise, there isn&#039;t much to say. The art is dull and uninspired, with not much detail throughout. The animation is choppy and framey. Hell, I could even point out some key frames that were left unfinished on the final episode, although that is just nitpicking. <br />
<br />
I can say the same thing about the sound that I can about the art, it was dull and uninspired. I don&#039;t even remember beat, any melody, or even if there were any insert songs because it was just that forgettable. The opening is notable only because it sounds like an Avril Lavigne pop song, but that&#039;s about it.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s clear that I didn&#039;t like this show, but I can&#039;t say that it is necessarily bad, because the show wasn&#039;t made for teenage guys like me in mind. That being said, I don&#039;t know if I would recommend this show to a teenage girl either based on my experiences. Take this review with a grain of salt, because I bet there are some who would find the shit that I didn&#039;t like about the show actually compelling. As for me, I&#039;m glad that this show is forever out of my mind, and I can go back to watching some more Monster or something.

    Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji was a very up and down experience for me. It is, to some degree, a story about romance and acceptance, presented in a more comedic manner.<br />
<br />
Story - 6/10.<br />
The story presented to us is a simple one. Our main character gets herself into a bit of a mess due to her compulsion to lie to gain friends, and this and that happens and she winds up with a frankly abhorrent guy who is essentially her &#039;owner&#039;. A simple concept for a romance anime relatively well-executed, especially in the comedy aspect. Nothing ground-breaking, there was no real depth to the story, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173673">
        any depth that was added into the story came off as a little shallow and contrived (for example, most of the flashbacks seemed to be trying to create a background just for the sake of it, as the story didn&#039;t really need much of it to be effective.)<br />
Most of the &#039;story&#039; really revolves around Erika and Kyoya and the way their relationship develops throughout the series, and as such it has no real resolution. It was also a little predictable at times.<br />
<br />
Art - 8/10.<br />
Not quite outstanding, but certainly worth a mention - the character designs were pretty consistent, the colours suited the mood the anime was trying to put across (for example the common bright colours seen in a comedy scene) and the backgrounds were nicely rendered. The characters weren&#039;t anything hugely unique, but at the same time they were very suited to the rom-com slice of life-ish genre, all looking relatively &#039;normal&#039;.<br />
<br />
Sound - 7/10.<br />
The opening theme to the anime was fitting to the genre - quite cute and bouncy and generally fun. The voices were good, and the background noise fit well, especially in the comedic moments.<br />
<br />
Character - 6/10.<br />
Although the series really revolved around Kyoya and Erika and their relationship and relationships with others, the two main characters are what could have made or broken the series for me. At first they are presented as two pretty awful personalities, one being a compulsive liar (and a bad one at that) and subsequently a subservient wet leaf, the other being on a VERY high horse with some sort of superiority complex. The premise behind the series was that the two would get into their &#039;dog&#039; and &#039;master&#039; roles and as a consequence they would most likely end up changing one another. This did happen, though it took its sweet time (which is why the series was so up-and-down for me). Erika really comes across as a weak personality until about half-way through the series at which point you can really see her effect on Kyoya and how their relationship develops, and how she develops from a really un-likeable character to a quite sweet person.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 7/10.<br />
I couldn&#039;t enjoy this series as much as I would have liked simply because I felt it was quite slow to get started, although there were cute and funny moments I really couldn&#039;t stand the main characters and up until they started changing and affecting each other I was left pretty frustrated with them. The second half was an exception for me, although there were some feeble attempts at creating drama generally it was successful in portraying Erika and Kyoya&#039;s relationship with one another and the effect different situations had on them.<br />

    Damn I gotta say this anime surprised me. <br />
<br />
So today I decided to take a break from hajime no ippo and my rewatch of eyeshield 21 and watch a short anime that would be you know easy to watch and enjoyable. And one of the best animes for that in my oppinion are slice of life / school / comedy animes. So while searching for a comedy anime I randomly came across Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji...and I gotta say I really enjoyed it more than I expected to as it was very easy to watch. But enough small talk let&#039;s jump into the review.<br />
<br />
Art

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175245">
        9 / 10<br />
<br />
I really enjoy this type of art and you could see the anime was made at a high quality. The characters were drawn as mostly generic / secondary characters but each one had a unique feature and you could easely tell them apart. The animation was fluid and smooth and really pleasant to the eye and damn Erika is sooo cute and Kyouya&#039;s eyes are epic.<br />
<br />
Sound 7/10<br />
<br />
The sound is quite generic. I do like the intro but the soundtrack of the anime is nothing out of the ordinary. The voices for the characters are alright. Not too fancy but they are not bad either. I honestly really like Erika&#039;s voice because I think it furthers the idea that she is a cute fun girl not a &quot;hot&quot; one.<br />
<br />
Character 7/10<br />
<br />
The characters are decent. They are nothing special though. You have this really funny (but also a very big and bad liar) protagonist girl (Erika) that is also a very sweet and nice person and you also got Kyouya who is kinda-of a sweet douchebag that turns into a somewhat nice guy by the end of the anime. The other characters are there but they are nothing too important since they episodic and just used to further the development of the 2 main characters Erika and Kyouya.<br />
<br />
Story 6/10<br />
<br />
Ok before I rant a bit here is an explanation why the story is a bit lower for me. I felt the anime could have ended midway at 2 certain events (they kinda follow each other quite fast but I will refrain from talking about them since it might spoil the anime, though they are not hard to guess). <br />
<br />
The rest of the episodes felt a bit like useless fillers but they were enjoyable nontheless.(I know they wanted to show the characters actually grow and stuff still the anime would have been as enjoyable without them in my oppinion). <br />
<br />
The story is pretty generic MC1 falls for MC2 while MC2 is a tsundere type char (even though Kyouya is not that tsundere you get the point). The anime follows all the required steps in the story and has a solid one. If it was a bit shorter (let&#039;s say 10 episodes) the anime would probably have been 1 7/10 or maybe even 8/10. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 8 / 10<br />
<br />
For some reason though I really enjoyed the anime. It was light-hearthed , somewhat funny and very easy to watch thus I went through it in one cold afternoon .<br />
<br />
Overall 8/10<br />
<br />
Overall the anime had charming MCs and their interactions were entertaining, it was light-hearthed , somewhat funny and very easy to watch and the art is really good.  I would recommend it to people who want an easy viewing while taking a break from more serious / longer animes.<br />

    ~generous note about how it&#039;s my first review and English isn&#039;t my native language~<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not really good with writing this kind of things, so let&#039;s see how will it go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji&quot;, also known as &quot;Wolf Girl and Black Prince&quot;.<br />
<br />
The story was told greatly. Nothing was missing. The great thing about it was that it isn&#039;t your typical shoujo/romance anime - it wasn&#039;t predictable and that&#039;s really what comes to liking. Although at the beginning I had problems with the romance/comedy that position has to offer - it&#039;s also not your usual humor (and romance) after all. The ending really satisfied me though.<br />
<br />
As

          <span style="display: none;" id="review174533">
        to art, I can&#039;t tell as a professional, because I&#039;m none of that... although I really liked it. The characters&#039; designs were great. Characters did not look similar.<br />
<br />
The seiyuus&#039; voices were matching perfectly. The background music was fitting and so I&#039;ll try to find the OST and listen to it. I particularly liked both OP/ED songs, they&#039;re catchy and may want to make you sing along.<br />
<br />
As I stated before, this isn&#039;t your typical anime. This one tells a more realistic story. That also means the characters were more realistic, although I don&#039;t really know if you&#039;d like to place yourself in the shoes of one of the main characters. I couldn&#039;t relate to any of the characters, but that didn&#039;t make me dislike them. The main characters actually grew throughout the series, which was great to look at. The supporting cast was hilarious in a good way. I&#039;ll definitely remember the characters in the future.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I think you&#039;ll enjoy this series, because... it shows some realistic things, which are surprising, but great nonetheless. Even if you&#039;re not a big fan of anime (or just these genres), you should definitely check this one out. I&#039;ll surely go back to the anime and start reading the manga. Also, I think re-watching will definitely add to the enjoyment. I&#039;d love to own this series. The series was really memorable and unique in its own way.<br />
<br />
Moral of the story is: <br />
~SPOILER~<br />
Don&#039;t take pictures (or maybe do take them?) of random people and do not (?) try to pretend they&#039;re your second half.

    (This has been adapted from my reddit thread)<br />
<br />
Society can often exert pressures on everyday people, causing them to behave or act in a certain way. These may be small in scale, such as deciding what restaurant to eat at, or more grand, such as who to vote for in the next election. It&#039;s something that many people often experience, that inkling feeling of wanting to &quot;fit in.&quot; This is just as true in relation to love. People love others for fun, while some may find solace in establishing a meaningful connection. In Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji, these societal pressures and loving ideas are tested,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173583">
        giving us an okay little anime.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Ookami Shoujo follows Erika, a young high school girl who, finding herself without any friends in her new class, makes up a lie. This lie leads her to Kyouya, with the journey unfolding from there.<br />
<br />
For Ookami Shoujo, it quite quickly sets up its overall &quot;format:&quot; introduce a side character, utilize him/her for a few episodes, progress Erika and Kyouya&#039;s relationship, and then repeat. It&#039;s simple, but often times it leads to the same repetitive character actions. Erika getting upset at Kyouya, the side character more or less not showing up ever again, and the relationship experiencing the same hurdles constantly are common within each mini-arc. This causes a bad association with often boring developments, because the audience knows exactly what to expect.<br />
<br />
What this one does right, though, is portraying or at least displaying such a couple. In anime, many romances revolve around the &quot;normal&quot; guy having the cute and kind girl fall for one another. Ookami Shoujo strays away from this. Instead, Kyouya is the goal, with Erika chasing after his coattails. In laymen&#039;s terms, it&#039;s the classic &quot;girls love bad guys&quot; idea. And it works. The reason for this comes from the perception that is created for Kyouya and Erika. His derisive remarks and her wavering emotions demonstrate how such an unlikely couple operates. While people may think that everyone in a loving relationship maintain traits of kindness, awareness, and respect, this one gives us a varied look at what it means to &quot;care&quot; for another person.<br />
<br />
The show tries somewhat to present the idea that it&#039;s okay to just be yourself. There may exist a &quot;certain&quot; way to go about behaving, but learning to just be who you are (obviously, within reason) and not caving to such pressures makes life a much more rewarding experience. I say somewhat, because this direction is lost somewhere around halfway through the season, where it then begins to focus almost entirely on the romance. This is perhaps due in part to the character developments of the main cast. Opting for pure romance is fine, but since the earlier idea was first introduced, there needed to be some semblance of balance -- peer pressure and romance.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
<br />
Ookami Shoujo sits in a rather strange spot.<br />
<br />
The art style is what I usually describe as &quot;soft.&quot; It most often exists within shoujo anime, where the locales and characters are given an aura about them that makes everything seem plain or natural. A good comparison would be to Kimi ni Todoke. With an average amount of detail, the show usually incorporates more flair and appeal during the comedy bits. Here, the anime defers to more goofy eyes and faces, shining backgrounds, and other fantastical tricks.<br />
<br />
As far as character designs go, Kyouya is rather boring with his usual long-sleeve shirts and ruffled hair. Erika, however, sees many transformations from her hair to her outfits. Making more comparisons, while she doesn&#039;t hold the same allure, Erika&#039;s simple beauty reminded me greatly of Nanami from Kamisama Kiss.<br />
<br />
The actual animation is somewhat lacking, mainly due to the nature of the show. That is, it&#039;s mostly just dialogue between the main couple or conversations existing between other classmates and side characters. The animation can pick up during the aforementioned comedic bits, though.<br />
<br />
It also has a habit of doing this weird technique of having the characters speaking dialogue with just their portraits being shown in the foreground. This just adds to the argument that the animation within the anime is sometimes missing.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
Ookami Shoujo actually contains an okay set of characters despite the underwhelming story.<br />
<br />
As the star of the show, Erika is a nice young girl who is quick to be dishonest. Her &quot;true self&quot; causes her more trouble than it&#039;s worth, but she consistently makes it her mission to fabricate her life as much as possible. While she is quick to lie, when faced with hardship and reality, she is unusually emotional. While her initial relationship with Kyouya starts off as nothing more than a game, her feelings rapidly move from side girl to lover the more time she spends with him. Her ability to handle not only what Kyouya dishes out but also his rather hostile attitude makes her the seemingly perfect girl for him.<br />
<br />
Kyouya&#039;s public persona paints him as a perfect prince. What hides beneath this kind mask he has created is a river filled with scorn, hatred, and just downright evil. At every opportunity that presents itself, he attempts to make Erika&#039;s life a living nightmare. He&#039;s actually incredibly standoffish and unbearably cruel. But in truth, this is just another of his masks. With Erika now in his life, what one finds behind his (many) shells is a young man filled with compassion and awareness.<br />
<br />
There is a huge issue with his character, however. The anime attempted to expand upon why Kyouya acts the way he does, but it comes off as being insignificant due to its quick overview and extremely late inclusion. While his development from an intolerable brute to a slightly jerk-ish boyfriend was nice to see, his actual characterization lacks the depth that was constantly alluded to throughout the season.<br />
<br />
As for the side cast, while they are cast aside more literally than their title implies, what they do is try to propel Erika and Kyouya&#039;s relationship, and more specifically Kyouya, forward. Each mini-arc aims to add another crack to those shells of his, giving Erika the chance to crush them for good. This is accomplished by having Kyouya experience suppressed emotions: jealousy, happiness, and nervousness, to name a few. They&#039;re tiny actions, but they slowly build on one another, letting Kyouya go through the development that he does.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
The OP is okay. The vocalist, guitar, and drums work nicely in unison, with the singer being given the opportunity to showcase a decent amount of range.<br />
<br />
The ED actually gets my vote as one of the best of the season. The strange ambient sound effects, the pinging, and the somewhat slow singing make it very fun to listen to on each and every playback.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is sadly not as good. The one track featuring a wavy trumpet and hanging triangle that played during certain sections was usually catchy, but everything else falls under the &quot;generic&quot; category.<br />
<br />
Finally, for voice acting, there are no notable performances to be had. At the minimum, Kanae Itou as Erika did somewhat above average.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
I say it time and time again: romance is my go-to genre above all others. Watching Erika get flustered around Kyouya or Kyouya looking to protect his girlfriend from a potential jerk made me happy to see. Obviously there are other elements placed throughout, such as gift exchanges, pictures, and those all-important couple moments. And they all had their intended effect: making me smile.<br />
<br />
This anime is also pretty funny. Even though Kyouya is really cruel, Erika&#039;s reactions were always good for a laugh. The animation, as stated previously, also adds to the comedy. It does try to inject smaller dramatic moments, but these are overshadowed by the more hilarious and romantic ones, which was for the better.<br />
<br />
Overall, Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji is a simple romance story featuring a not-so-simple couple. While the plot may be missing, the characters involved at least try to make up for it. And if this anime teaches us anything, it&#039;s that not everyone should always be taken at face value.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Bad, unique romance filled with repetition and unclear themes<br />
<br />
Animation: Fine, &quot;soft&quot; art style, average actual animation<br />
<br />
Characters: Fine, Erika is okay, Kyouya is good, side cast is okay<br />
<br />
Sound: Fine, okay OP, great ED, okay soundtrack, average VA work<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Good, nice romantic elements mixed with comedy<br />
<br />
Final Score: 5/10

    A pretty common complaint about romance anime is that the romance aspect – that is, the main attraction of the show – is slow to develop and the characters take an eternity to get together. Oftentimes, we have drama and comedy taking up screen time of what could be couples fawning over one another and going out on dates. To some people, that means that the bulk of a romance anime is filler, with the characters only getting together or confessing in the last few episodes – and sometimes, not even then! (Kimi ni Todoke, anyone?) Then came along Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji, where

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182351">
        the main characters get together in the first episode – oh, no, wait, I&#039;m mistaken. They&#039;re actually faking it. Sorry to get your hopes up! But wait, there&#039;s more. They do drop the faux couple act later on...it&#039;s just a matter of whether or not you&#039;ll have the patience to actually stick with it to the end. And I&#039;m not promising you&#039;ll enjoy it, even if you do, for the simple fact that it takes some amount of distance to like this anime. <br />
<br />
Shinohara Erika is a bit different from the usual shoujo main character. She&#039;s simple-minded and dense, true, but she also has an enormous yearning to fit in with her peers. Additionally, she&#039;s not afraid to tell a lie to do so. Erika wants to be accepted and loved so much that she is quick to fall head over heels for anyone who shows even the slightest bit of kindness to her. She&#039;s very gullible and very eager to please. That actually makes her a somewhat well-rounded protagonist; at least she&#039;s well-developed enough that she is believable and even understandable. I&#039;m sure we all know someone who is a little (or a lot) like Erika in some ways. What is a bit less believable is her single-minded, almost self-destructive thirst to be accepted, but hey, there are people like that, too. <br />
<br />
Sata Kyouya, on the other hand, adopts the persona of a “kindhearted prince”, when in reality he&#039;s a cold, sadistic individual. Calculating and observant, he&#039;s the sort that likes to know he has complete control of himself and his surroundings. He doesn&#039;t really understand emotions or romance, mainly because, as a child, a particular event caused him to become extremely closed off and reproachful of anyone who tried to get close to him. While it doesn&#039;t excuse his actions in any way, shape, or form, it definitely helps one understand his actions. There&#039;s almost nothing sadder than a home that lacks a mother, and that lack of presence is felt. Over the course of the anime, he becomes less of a cold bastard and more simply a reserved, introverted individual. In that regard, he&#039;s a bit original, even though he does display some tsundere traits.  <br />
<br />
So, what brings this unlikely duo together? During the first day of high school, Erika meets two girls in her class. Desperate for friends, she nearly trips over her own two feet to integrate herself into their group. This entails being “just like them” and having a boyfriend of her own. A few months into the semester, though, her newfound “friends” are already beginning to smell her lie – especially since Erika doesn&#039;t have a single picture of her boyfriend to show them. One day, Erika sees a cute guy on the street and decides to take a picture of him, playing him off as her boyfriend. Only problem is that the guy she takes a picture of happens to be the “prince” of her school, Kyouya, and her friends recognize him almost immediately. This leaves her no choice but to ask Kyouya to pretend to be her boyfriend. He agrees, but for a price: she has to be his “dog”. <br />
<br />
I ought to be shaking my fist, right? I ought to loathe this anime along with the likes of Itazura na Kiss, Diabolik Lovers, and Mitsu x Mitsu Drops, right? Problem is, I don&#039;t. It takes a particular person to laugh at the jokes and humour in Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji, and a particular viewpoint, and if you fit neither, it&#039;s safe to say you&#039;ll hate this anime. However, this anime is a lot more tolerable than those of the same ilk – for one thing, Kyouya isn&#039;t a psychopath like Irie Naoki of ItaKiss. He&#039;s not doing the things he does because he genuinely wants to hurt her, he genuinely has no understanding of the fact that she&#039;s affected to the extent that she is. In fact, by the end of the anime, it&#039;s made pretty clear that he&#039;s trying his damned hardest to break down his own inner walls and inhibitions and be more affectionate to Erika. He just doesn&#039;t know how, darn it. I&#039;m not the greatest at showing my emotions, either. I can hardly blame the guy. I&#039;m betting he&#039;s an INTJ. We INTJs always have problems with those flimsy, abstract things. <br />
<br />
Now, I&#039;m not excusing his actions, and if I were Erika&#039;s friend, I&#039;d tell her to break it off with Kyouya. But Erika herself doesn&#039;t seem to want to. She&#039;s given multiple opportunities to break it off with him, and never takes them. Even when she&#039;s been separated from him for days, she still decides, of her own volition, to go back to him, because she still likes him no matter what he does. As she herself states, she likes him because of who he is, and changing even a single part of him wouldn&#039;t make him the same person anymore. If he makes her genuinely happy and he isn&#039;t forcing her to be with him, then who I am to judge? I certainly can&#039;t go about forcing my ideals on others. <br />
<br />
Plus, let&#039;s face it: not everyone&#039;s perfect, and not everyone is going to know exactly what&#039;s right and wrong to do in a relationship. The anime is basically the beginning of their adventure with something called “dating”, and forgive them if they don&#039;t know how to swim in deep water right away. Also, believe me: Kyouya&#039;s behaviour toward Erika gets a million times better in the manga, especially when you compare him to the first couple episodes of the anime. <br />
<br />
If you don&#039;t have a sensitive skin and aren&#039;t the type to go social justice on everything, even the moments where Kyouya “scolds” Erika can actually be fairly amusing. At least, I found myself chuckling a few times upon my rewatch of the anime. In any case, there are times everyone has disagreements, and our main characters are no exception. Of interesting note is the fact that the anime brings up morals and conduct quite a bit, and really likes to pose the question of what is or isn&#039;t all right to do. Of course, one&#039;s mileage may vary, and the point of the matter is that there are different ways to approach love and romance, and making mistakes is fine so long as you realize what you&#039;re doing wrong and try to fix it. Neither Kyouya nor Erika are innocent in this regard. Erika, for her part, has a highly rose-coloured view of love, and Kyouya has a fairly negative impression of it. And Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji is what you get when those extremes clash. <br />
<br />
Since this is only a twelve episode anime, we don&#039;t have that many side characters. They are mainly Sanda Ayumi, Erika&#039;s best friend; Marin and Tezuka, the two girls Erika meets in her class; and Takeru, Kyouya&#039;s friend from the middle school era. Of course, there are other characters as well, but they hardly get enough screen time or development to be considered truly important. A couple are only introduced for one episode and then forgotten. That being said, that doesn&#039;t mean the other characters develop at all. They&#039;re static. Marin and Tezuka are introduced as two girls who constantly talk about their boyfriends, and that&#039;s who they are in the end. Sanda relentlessly offers Erika advice and informs her that she is a masochist for putting up with Kyouya&#039;s behaviour – that doesn&#039;t change, either. Takeru is introduced as a guy full of a manly sense of justice, and he doesn&#039;t change one bit. That doesn&#039;t meant they&#039;re bad characters, though, since the majority of the character development comes from Erika and Kyouya. Mostly Kyouya. <br />
<br />
The opening theme is a vaguely catchy number by SpecialThanks, called LOVE GOOD TIME. The vocalist has a somewhat slurry, “rock and roll princess” sort of accent that immediately reminds me of Full Moon wo Sagashite&#039;s openings (both of which are by THE*SCANTY). The song itself is rather upbeat, but not necessarily memorable, apart from the singer&#039;s voice. The ending is Ookami Heart, sung by Oresama. It&#039;s pretty average stuff as well. The whole soundtrack is just quite mediocre; while I didn&#039;t notice any overly obvious usage of repeated tracks, there were several moments where I found myself thinking, “oh, this sounds just like a theme I heard in ___”. In short, while the music isn&#039;t extravagant, it does its job just fine. The Japanese voice actors are pretty good. They really fit with the characters they were meant to represent. <br />
<br />
The art is nice and clean. Typical shoujo fare, really. The guys are good-looking and the girls are cute. Sparkles and bubbles abound. When the animation isn&#039;t focused on those, it&#039;s pretty fluid. TYO Animations does a pretty good job! Thankfully, there isn&#039;t a surplus of chibi/super-deformed segments, which jives just right with me, since I&#039;m not usually overly fond of those. One interesting thing to note is that Ookami Shoujo tends to animate talking heads over backgrounds during extended character interaction scenes. By that I mean, if two characters are sitting at a table and talking, often, the “camera” will display a wide, blurry shot of the scene, and the busts of the characters will be added over top. Something similar is done with extended walking or travel scenes; just the legs of the character in question are shown while the scenery changes. Just something I noticed. <br />
<br />
Overall, while Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji definitely can provide entertainment, laughs, and “the feels”, it&#039;s definitely not for everyone. Kyouya&#039;s initial behaviour most certainly comes across as overly brusque at first. Take it from someone who was agonizing for hours over why she thought Ookami Shoujo was all right, though: he does get better, a lot better. As does the anime. Episode 8 and up ought to be pretty easy to get through, in fact, especially episode 10, which is probably my favourite, and really recommended if you want to see how tolerable the anime gets as a whole. <br />
<br />
TL;DR: Watch at your own risk and don&#039;t be afraid to leave your overly quick conclusions at the door.

    I have to admit I have a certain something against shoujo, and this show reminds me why. It&#039;s so... generic. So generic in fact I have difficulty thinking what exactly to review. Unpopular, average girl is paired up with the school idol due to certain circumstances... what&#039;s not to love...?<br />
<br />
The main character, Erika, is easily dismissed as another generic female lead. She has absolutely nothing to distinguish her--save her tendencies to lie, and I got to admit she has a sort of talent to it if she can keep up with the other two girls she hangs out with. I find her to be fairly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review188393">
        shallow, however, as she doesn&#039;t seem to mind having fake friends as long as she isn&#039;t alone, tends to dismiss her only actual friend, and made a certain remark about loners being losers that made me dislike her from the start.<br />
<br />
Okay, fine, that last one was personal.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast doesn&#039;t get any better. Kyouya is another hot dude with temper issues and who can come off as a jerkass, but has a hidden nice side usually revealed by petting cats, or in this case dogs. Oh, and bonus points for having a dark past. <br />
<br />
The closest thing resembling an original character is Erika&#039;s friend, you see, and I can&#039;t even remember her name. <br />
<br />
The art is okay-ish, nothing that stands out, sound is fairly generic. The story is... well, what story? So Kyouya covers Erika&#039;s lies and pretends to be his boyfriend while torturing her mercilessly in secret? And that&#039;s about it. The rest are overused devices such as the sick episode or the Declaration of Protection. And let&#039;s not forget about the main lead soothing the broody guy&#039;s heart and making him fall for her. Please.<br />
<br />
A highlight is the comedy. It legit made me laugh and the dynamics between characters weren&#039;t terrible. I actually kind of liked Kyouya, maybe because he tortured Erika, whom I despise, and I&#039;m rather fond of the trolling type of people.<br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s... well. Just an anime swimming in the middle of mediocrity, relying solely on wish-fulfillment, a hot guy, and maybe some comedic value to be popular. Definitely not something that will make you think, but then again anime like these come in handy when all we want is to get out of reality.

    Ok, after watching 7 episodes of this show I dropped it in pure disgust. For some reason I had the idea that &quot;Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji&quot; would be simiular to &quot;Class president is a Maid!&quot; (which I  loved), but boy was wrong. Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji made me feel at such unease that I felt compelled to write a review about why I disliked it so much. This review may contain minor spoliers to exemplify my grave distaste of the show. So let´s begin.<br />
<br />
Story: 1/10<br />
The storyline of &quot;Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji&quot; are how the girl Erika is trying to fit in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review232088">
        in a group of superfical girls at high school, and makes up a story that she has a boyfriend. The boy in question is the schools hottie (Sata) that every girl at the school drowls over. Sata agrees to play along with Erikas lie for his own reasons (basically to use her as a slave to do whatever he wants her to do, to satisfy his own dark needs). Sounds a little bit intresting right? But it soon turns out to by pathetic story about a girl with no other desire then the to make the cruel and cold boy to love her, and does anything to get his love. It comes to the point that Erikas highlight of the week is that she´s getting a pet on the head because she was a good dog and fetched whatever it was he wanted (it´s actually is illustrated by Erika with ears and a wiggeling tail). It gave my gag reflexes. But hey, the poor Sata had a childhood experince that made him sadstic and cruel so it´s ok right? I actually found myself screaming at Erika that, yes, you are stupied and have no selfrespect or selfesteam at all. Even the comedy became a place for Erika to further humiliate herself.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
The only good thing about the show. Cant blame decent art for the catastrophic story. The characters are nicley drawn and the backgrounds fill their purpuse (to be the stage of this &quot;love&quot; story). <br />
<br />
Sound: 4/10<br />
Can´t remember so much of the music due to my horror of how the show played out. OP was ok but that nothing that stood out. Otherwise voice acting was fine but nothing I could appriciate. <br />
<br />
Characters: 1/10<br />
I have all ready been talking about the characters a bit due to that the story pretty much only are character based. But I will elaborate a bit more.<br />
<br />
First we have Erika, your average high school girl whos only worries is to fit in and not be lonely at high school. Nothing wrong with that but it´s more important to her to fit in than get actual friends (even do she has ha great best friend, Sanda). Later on the only thing in the world that´s important to Erika is to upgrade from dog to girlfriend status to Sata. She is also a pathological liar whom later gives the advice to others &quot;to be true to them selfs&quot;. Otherwise I really cant say much about her, because her whole beeing centers aorund Sata. Yes, didn´t finish the show so I can´t tell if there are any major character development for Erika, but I dout that. Once a masochist always a masochist. <br />
<br />
Then we have Sata... Yes, he is very good looking and appears to others as a gentleman but his true colors are really dark. He clearly enjoys to make others feel small and useless. He actually gets seroius kicks of making Erika run for sticks like a dog and do other humiliating things. Sata is also very controlling which screams &quot;psychopath&quot; long way. He doesnt use words like love, but states that things (oh I meen Erika) belongs to him. He actually claimed once in the show &quot;that he didn´t liked that a guy made Erika cry for now good reason, because she belonged to him&quot;. But he himself makes Erika cry like 5 times each episode. He creeped me out.<br />
<br />
Can´t really say anything good or bad about the supporting crew, which only function seems to be contribute to the MC´s &quot;love&quot; story in some way. We have the best friends that give advices and listens to the MC´s complains, the guys whos function is to make Sata jealues and a superfical girls group which competes for &quot;I have the best boyfriend and best relationship&quot;.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1/10<br />
Absolutly no enjoyment for me. Episode 1 gave some potentail to a bit wierd but intresting story but falls all ready in epsiode 2 for me.. After that I was just horrified.<br />
<br />
Overall: 2/10<br />
The only thing that makes me give it a 2 instead of 1 is the art, which was pretty good. It gives me nightmares that young girls watch this and starts idolize cruel psycho dudes whos only attributes is good looks and if you &quot;hang&quot; in there long enough and do whatever he wants he will some day love you.

    Only one phrase has been going through my mind in these last few episodes: &quot;S&amp;M.&quot;<br />
<br />
We have a sadistic prince and a masochistic dog. What&#039;s not to love? Everything, apparently. Once again I run into a show that abuses cliches to no end. Another show whose potential was wasted with convenient plot devices and little to no character development. I swear to god, the main heroine is a fucking shallow piece of shit. I don&#039;t know much about her other than the fact that she falls in love with anyone who does a nice thing to her. As a guy, I hope no girls are like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175219">
        this, otherwise, they, just like the heroine of this show, will be played over and over and over and over again.<br />
<br />
The side characters and their development in this story is basically nonexistent. Plot devices. :/<br />
<br />
The heroine? Fuck, what was her name again? The only thing I remember her being called was a dog. Shows how memorable she is, right?<br />
<br />
I think I might drop this show. I honestly don&#039;t know how much more I can take of an asshole guy and his trusty sidekick, a girl with one of the most annoying personalities of any show I&#039;ve seen. Watch this show if you&#039;re just really bored and can&#039;t find anything else to watch. If you&#039;re expecting comedy, don&#039;t even bother. You&#039;ll just be met with slapstick humor that gets really dull after the second episode.<br />
<br />
EDIT: In the end, I did end up dropping it. Lol.

    It&#039;s a shame I feel such a desperate need to review this show, such desperation I&#039;m willing to lose my review virginity for it. But rather than offering a critique, I&#039;d like to address how this became the first show (after years of continuous anime watching), that I truly believe no one should ever watch. <br />
<br />
Just so my inevitable bias is clear, my core evaluation of a show is its story. Not necessarily the execution of story-telling, but it must have the basic idea of what its story is and how to navigate us through it to achieve its purpose. That being said, a kindergartner

          <span style="display: none;" id="review269879">
        is capable of telling a story as simple as &quot;A man fell in a hole and then got up .&quot; Yes, this is an incredibly dumb story, its more of a statement than a story, but yet, its still better than Wolf Girl and Black Prince. <br />
<br />
(This will spoil the show, but it will save you from watching it, so don&#039;t mind)<br />
<br />
Wolf Girl and Black Prince - literally translated by the anime into Liar Girl and Sadistic Hot Guy, follows the story of Erika, a girl who lies about dating hot guy Kyouya; the most mentally abusive male MC in Shoujo&#039;s- correction: anime&#039;s history. Yes, even worse than Asta. Our story revolves around hot guy Kyouya verbally abusing, threatening, and manipulating Erika&#039;s emotions to the point where he jokingly offers to buy her (his dog, which she herself accepts as being) a collar and a leash for Christmas, she is so grateful for his kind offer its the happiest we see her the entire show. This abuse climaxes soon after when Erika finally steps up and requests Kyouya to reciprocate to her feelings, which contrary to what you may expect, he does. He lets her know how its all been a tease, how he truly loves her and never meant to hurt her. Only to moments later shatter this by self-retorting (and I take a small liberty in translation for clarity sake):  &quot;I would never say anything like that moron, go fuck yourself&quot;. Erika (thankfully) responds correctly by dumping water all over him. <br />
<br />
They make up next episode, don&#039;t worry. BUT WAIT! They actually break up the next-next episode after Erika overhears our new main-man, the savior, the light to amend this disgusting relationship- Yuu, question Kyouya about his true feelings, which receives the appropriate response: &quot;She just my play-thing&quot; -Kyouka. Erika, hearing all this, lets Yuu know he&#039;s got a chance. After an episode or two of Yuu being kind and cheerful, making sure Erika is recovering from her abusive relationship, Erika decides she misses being called a dog and friend-zones him. Returning to Kyouko (and I&#039;m not kidding) 10 seconds later. <br />
<br />
Pause. So far Erika dealt with 3 men, the second I won&#039;t bother naming. hot guy Kyouko- who she had no interest in, and he just wanted someone to bully. Hot guy #2- Another playboy who protecced her and instantaneously asked her out knowing she had a boyfriend. After Erika gladly accepts and falls for him, letting him know Kyouko isn&#039;t a real boyfriend, he rejects her saying &quot;I just wanted to steal Kyouko-san&#039;s girl, who are you?&quot; -#2. Now here comes our boy Yuu- they have chemistry from the get-go. Erika notices him albeit his timidness and they have the first (and only) none-cringe male to female conversation in this show. He humbly admits he isn&#039;t as attractive and Kyouko, but with him she&#039;ll be respected, happy, cared-for, anything is better than being called someone&#039;s bitch... right? The only romance that ACTUALLY sprouted from &quot;normal&quot; love got shutdown so fast Erika fetching a stick for Kyouko lasted longer (Again, not joking). This is where I dropped.<br />
<br />
If there was a smidgen of decent story telling I would&#039;ve stuck along just get it over with, but the foreshadowing, pacing, character development, humor, the decisions, their thoughts, their actions, the FUCKING GOAL of the story were all so miserable I felt watching any further will result in irreversible brain damage. I kept blindly believing there must be some light at the end of this dark dark journey, but it just kept getting darker. I don&#039;t need to watch the rest to know Erika will be called a dog for the rest of her life and they&#039;ll live happily ever after- I watched half the show and this relationship was so forced down your throat there was nothing to look forward to. <br />
<br />
This is a story of an abusive relationship being displayed with shiny lights- letting all the innocent teenage girl viewers know no matter how good of a guy you find, if he isn&#039;t the hottest human being you know, he isn&#039;t good enough. And if you somehow get this god-tier attractive boyfriend, no matter what he does to you, &quot;you can&#039;t help who you fall for&quot;, so get used to his abuse, his awful personality, and likely cheating, and smile through it. This anime feeds on teenage girls thirst for being popular rather than a good romance, and keeps them on edge through use of the worst &quot;plot twists&quot; I have seen, half the plot twists are by definition abuse. <br />
<br />
I have watched many similar shows, and this by miles on miles on miles the worst thing I&#039;ve ever seen from anime. -1/10. I don&#039;t doubt many young viewers had an &#039;attractiveness over anything&#039; shoved into their beliefs because of this. This is a disservice to society.

    I&#039;ll just keep this short: don&#039;t watch this anime. It has a horrible premise, annoying characters, and has horrible animation. <br />
<br />
The premise is basically about a abusive relationship. The guy withholds affection, treats her horribly, and that is supposed to be treated like COMEDY. How can somebody write and produce such a disgusting example of a relationship? <br />
<br />
Also, HOW is this anime semi-popular?! I&#039;m sorry if I offended you, but I had to get this off my chest. <br />
<br />
The opening is fine, except for the sucky animation and the nonsense shots. <br />
<br />
The characters are all bad. <br />
<br />
Overall, do yourself a favor and don&#039;t watch this

    well , Rom-coms are kind of my specialty ! i&#039;m not a big fan of horror/action/mystery genre <br />
<br />
Im going to start with the positive side of this anime <br />
<br />
characters 8/10 <br />
well-crafted but not quite lovable ! <br />
i loved kyoya&#039;s dark persona ,, it was one of the main reasons this show is very popular ,, when you have a character like kyoya you can have a successful comedy ,, i mean his character allows the author to make a good joke simply out of ANYTHING <br />
<br />
i wasn&#039;t a big fan of our heroine &quot; erika &quot; she was meant to be annoying/needy i know that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173789">
        but her character seems very ,, i don&#039;t know umm dull ? she doesn&#039;t have the it factor to be a heroine that is how i felt <br />
<br />
the side characters weren&#039;t that interesting and their personalities weren&#039;t very clear to the audience ,, maybe we will know them better in the 2nd season ?<br />
<br />
Art 10/10<br />
the art was nice ,, i love the semi-bright colors ,, it wasn&#039;t too flashy or too gloomy <br />
<br />
sound 9/10<br />
the voice actors were perfect for the characters and the music was good too <br />
<br />
now the down/negative side of this anime <br />
<br />
story 6/10<br />
it is like your everyday  shoujo anime  ,, the only real shocker was in the first 2 episodes then it gets BORING  like really boring <br />
you have the festival episode ,, the date episode ,, the OMG we kissed episode ,, you name it is there ! i had really high expectations for this anime &quot; plot-wise &quot; but it was MEH <br />
 <br />
<br />
enjoyment 7/10 <br />
it was good ,, but i was easily distracted while watching it ,, every scene was a little bit longer then it should have <br />
<br />
over all 7/10 <br />
it was a good light hearted anime i would recommend  it to someone that wants to take a break from all the action/fighting manga/anime<br />
