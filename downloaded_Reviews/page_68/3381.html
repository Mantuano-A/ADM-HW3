    First of all dont be scared of the 6.80 overall rating, because is really enjoyable, if you like romance and comedy anime. It&#039;s short anyaway (12min/ep) so give it a try. *(anime finished ariring but online we can find atm only 5eps)*<br />
<br />
Story (7):<br />
At the beginning seem a cliché anime, girl like guy, write a love letter and then we focus on romance developement and drama between them.<br />
<br />
May seem true for the first 5 min of the anime, but we already discover a big &quot;secret&quot; of Kurihara(our Mc female), she&#039;s a yandere and that make it hilarious most of the time seeing her thoughts and the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214405">
        reaction of her friend.<br />
<br />
Romance develope slowly (good thing in my opionion), but since this anime Mc male always choose the first girl I&#039;m a bit disappointed because at 5 ep they introduce a new female character (rival probably) that has a crush on Momotsuki too and I alredy love her *.*<br />
<br />
Art (7):<br />
Nothing much to say, clear and appealing though I usually dont really like Shojo manga art.<br />
<br />
Sound (-):<br />
Nothing to say, there isnt any atm.<br />
<br />
Character (7):<br />
-Support easily forgettable.<br />
-Mc male shy and a bit tsundere, but its alright I guess since is is first love experience and at 15 years old you are shy because usually around this age you start discovering and experiencing love and all those new feelings.<br />
-Mc female is funny and like I said she&#039;s a yandere, so... yes :D<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (8):<br />
This is, in my opinion, the strongest part of this anime, is really a lighthearted and funny anime, with good romance overall.<br />

    tldr; this is a moe anime and it makes you feel moe well, so it&#039;s good. 9/10.<br />
<br />
This anime ain&#039;t gonna make you feel. It ain&#039;t gonna make you be amazed with intricate story plots and heart wrenching scenes. This ain&#039;t that type of anime.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a moe anime. If you&#039;re looking to say &quot;d&#039;awww&quot; and be smiling while watching these two lovebirds be shy and cute, this is the anime for you! <br />
<br />
Don&#039;t listen to the other reviews where they rate it badly because of the lack of story or they don&#039;t find an intricate plot where there&#039;s not meant to be any. This anime is

    You know this type of anime that are so cute that one can&#039;t help but say &quot;awww, this is adorable!&quot;? Momokuri is one of it&#039;s finest examples.<br />
<br />
Yuki Kurihara is a girl that is absolutely obssesed with Momo, mainly just because he&#039;s extremely cute due to his short height and a bit girly looking, calling Yuki a stalker doesn&#039;t make justice to her character, she knows everything about him: what he does, what he likes and dislikes... all before they start their relationship during the first seconds of the anime and without him knowing about it.<br />
<br />
While this might look creepy and the perfect concept for a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review225031">
        yandere anime, Momokuri focuses in the cute parts of this, and gives us a lighthearted, happy, and absolutely adorable romance between this two characters. The side characters are also pretty good and represent well and realistically their paper of friends of the main duo.<br />
<br />
Both art and pretty average, but fit well with the anime, special mention to the opening of the TV version, that I personally like a lot.<br />
<br />
If you enjoy lighthearted SoL romances, or you&#039;re simply attracted to the &quot;cute stalker girl&quot; that Yuki is, Momokuri is totally worth the try.<br />

    Every anime that focuses on romance requires some sort of unexpected developments within the story and plot. It should feature sudden developments that could have a devastating effect to the characters along with the events or narrative. There should be drama, emotional moments full of dialogue, and although optional, should introduce a cast of characters that you can fantasize together for your fan fictions that nobody cares about. Lastly its’ crucial that there are characters that viewers can make a personal connection with to understand them better! Momokuri throws away the standards of the typical romance anime, and curb stomps it to the ground while

          <span style="display: none;" id="review229918">
        laughing maniacally. It replaces the very essences of the romance genre with moe moe cuteness.<br />
<br />
The best thing about romances is that they&#039;ll often feature a male or female protagonist. Through his or her journey, we are able to see their mental struggle, hard work and the effort they go through in order to confess their love. The story of MomoKuri ruins the very thing that makes a romance story romantic and deep.  The whole story is a cute mess. From the very beginning the two main characters are already a couple, it’s just that Momo and Yuki have difficulties expressing their love verbally. The two have a difficult time trying to approach each other and act more like lovers instead of two awkward stalker creeps. What’s worse is that a majority of times where there were tense, serious moments that could’ve been romantic, it was quickly ruined by comedy. For example, &quot;Momo is finally about to kiss Yuki and chickens out.&quot; &quot;At that moment, when he’s too afraid to do anything, the story tries to take a comedic turn by doing random reaction faces while he’s freaking out.&quot; It ruins the mood along with the scene. <br />
<br />
The comedic moments were not as funny as I thought they would be. In fact, most of the comedic scenarios came off as “forced.” Its’ like “ha ha ha, you laugh at this terrible turn of events right now” or “Yuki is a stalker with a loyal dogs personality” laugh right now. It was in poor taste in my opinion. Following this goo goo gaga story was like an unsatisfying road trip to a vacation destination with your friends or family. I was glad I was able to stomach the content. Otherwise I would’ve dropped it at the beginning.<br />
<br />
My biggest hope for the story was that Momo would have a rival in love. I thought that it would be interesting if another male character who loves Yuki would be introduced. That way there is some rivalry and more intense declarations of love to the female. Then I hoped that there would be a rival for Yuki, Rio. Again things just didn’t turn out in my favor. It turned me off from the story even more. The pacing is pretty straight-forward. Each episodes plot is full moe nonsense or failed attempts to try and get Yuki and Momo closer. By the time you know the episode is over and you&#039;re watching the ending credits. The plot and story doesn&#039;t seem to get any serious until it starts reaching the last few episodes.<br />
<br />
The story definitely is not something that I would consider watching this title again for. It&#039;s lacks the appeal that a standard or average romances title would have. I would say that maybe the writers were trying to be a little innovative with Momokuri however they just didn&#039;t do a good job stringing all together. <br />
<br />
<br />
The characters designs were great; most of the background settings looked pretty nice. I didn’t have many concerns with the animation.<br />
The quality of the show varied from time to time. I didn&#039;t like a majority of the animation they used outside of school. Nature background settings like trees, rain, grass looked like an animator just went into MS paint and added it into the final project. The skies and water lacked any sort of &quot;realism&quot; and the details of trees and grass were minimal. Now, this isn&#039;t a show that focuses on background settings as much as it does the actual characters. So its&#039; only natural that they avoid putting much detail into make certain &quot;environmental&quot; elements and crap look nice. It appeared as if a majority of the focus went into making the characters as cute and appealing as possible for the fans who love overly cute or &quot;moe&quot; designs. You&#039;ve got big detailed eyes in both males and females. Both male and female clothing are close to real life designer wear. They made sure to make those designs as cute as possible too. So if there&#039;s anything to be said about the art its&#039; that it is satisfying to look at, it&#039;s just don&#039;t set your expectations too high.<br />
<br />
Voice actors were pretty good delivering their lines. I was most impressed with Ai Kakuma&#039;s performance. She&#039;s definitely experienced when it comes to doing cute girls. I felt that her role as Yuki can definitely be something she can brag about her next try-outs. With Nobuhiko, I think this is my 3rd favorite role he&#039;s done acting like the &quot;tough, cool guy&quot; personality. The soundtrack was a little weak however it does fit the tone of the show. Satoshi Motoyama is an excellent sound director. So he has the experiences and knows who to get to give the show the &quot;life&quot; it needs. <br />
<br />
The characters as I mentioned earlier are made to be cute... &quot;moe.&quot; I honestly want to say that I did not like Yuki and Momo however; I did like seeing the progression the two made to finally became a full fledged couple. Rio seemed like she could&#039;ve been a better candidate for Yuki however, it seemed like the director wanted to go in that direction, but later kept the two as senpai &amp; kōhai. Respectful and kind to each other. it would&#039;ve been great to see an antagonistic rival compete with Momo for Yuki&#039;s love and affection but because of the shows &quot;moe&quot; &quot;fan-girly&quot; friendly approach. It seems that the writers decided to keep with the route that worked best for them. I&#039;ll have to admit it does pay off.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the best thing about Momokuri is that you often times I find myself being guilty of rooting Momo on. As much as I try and avoid romances, especially girly girl romances, I felt that I could indulge myself a little. Like, he has a QT 3.14 girl whose loyal, kind, forgiving, and a stalker. So why doesn&#039;t he man up and sweet talk her? He has so many opportunities to make their relationship closer but he keeps letting these opportunities pass. Sure, it was annoying and bothersome at first however; I found myself starting to enjoy this. I started to see what pattern and direction the show was going in and really had a fun time watching it.<br />
<br />
Overall the show really is for those who are into &quot;moe&quot; characters. If you like sweet straight-forward stories with happy endings then Momokuri is totally for you. As for me, I&#039;d probably skip on watching it again. I love shows that take on a much serious approach to romance. Shows that have a sense of realism in it. Lastly, Its&#039; not bad to like stories that are cute. If you like it, don&#039;t let anyone judge you, enjoy while it last.

Art/Characters: When first seeing this art, I was a little hesitant, but overall it looked pretty cute and the characters seemed to be interesting, so I gave it a go. I was not disappointed after watching just one or two episodes. The colors are really bright and cute and the animation is fluid and easy to follow. Overall I felt that this show was really easy on the eyes. One of the other things that I really appreciated about this art style is how crisp the characters look. The surroundings are the same way, and because of this, it didn’t look like the characters were

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230054">
        superimposed on top of a background that was clearly a different style than the rest. As for the characters themselves, I felt that Kurihara’s character really stood out to me as a rather obsessive character, but it was just obsessive enough without getting to creepy and that made it really funny and cute to watch. As for Momo, the other lead, he was just a bit to oblivious for my liking, but he still gave off a vibe of someone who wanted to be in love and wanted to make sure things always work out. The opening did a really good job of showcasing the different personality traits of each character and that is always a plus that we hardly ever see. <br />
<br />
Music/Sound: While this show had pretty generic music, I still really liked it. The opening song was one that I just could never skip because of how catchy it was. Normally when I come across a great opening song, it is a good indication of how much I will enjoy a show, and this was no exception. Not only the opening but the music that accompanies the scenes gives the show depth in places where it seems to lack, and this is highlighted really well in the latter half of the series. As for the sound there is a little bit of dip in the quality of this show, I am not too surprised, seeing as it was an Original Net Animation rather than a full-fledged production, but it wasn’t something that I can speak too negatively about. The music more than compensated for this, and that isn’t to say there wasn’t any sound, it was just very much overshadowed by the background music.<br />
<br />
Story: Kurihara Yuki is a high school 2nd year who is just trying to make it along in her life, but Momotsuki Shinya, a first year at the same school, is the focus of all of her time. She spends a lot of time admiring him from afar; taking pictures, collecting his trash, and generally obsessing over him, all without Momo’s knowledge. But after Kurihara, with some help from her best friend Mizuyama, musters up the courage to confess her feelings to Momo, he agrees to start going out with her. Even though they start to date, Kurihara can’t seem to stop her collecting behaviors. The plot progresses as these two explore dating and friendships within their groups. There are twists and turns that really make the show easy to follow and fun to watch.<br />
<br />
Personal Reflection: I really enjoyed seeing this show in the list of Summer Anime, I knew nothing about it but the art style was cute and the first episode was hilarious that I couldn’t stay away. I really loved how Kurihara wasn’t that creepy. An example of an over the line creepy character would be Kaho’s brother in Hatsukoi Monster (I go into more depth on that review), but there is just something about Kurihara that makes her less creepy and easier to pass off, even when the behavior isn’t much different. The problems that Momo faces when it comes to Kurihara are very real and not to out-of-character for someone who has never had a girlfriend before. There are times when Him and Kurihara have disagreements, or even outright fights, and rather than going back to normal in an instant (which would be extremely out of character for him, he grows and moves on from the problem after learning from it. Momokuri is a show of first-times, confusion, a hint of crazy, and a whole lot of funny; if that seems like something you are into, check it out!<br />
<br />
Overall Score: 8/10<br />
<br />

    Imagine if you mix the cutest characters and ship those characters together. Well imagine no further, because Momokuri offers just that!<br />
<br />
What got me into this series is that despite it being a shoujo anime, it didn&#039;t seem like one. To me, it looked like a normal romcom that both boys and girls would watch. Perhaps it&#039;s because it targets both the guy and the girl&#039;s feelings. We know what both of them are thinking of, thus there&#039;s no mystery or plot convenience.<br />
<br />
The characters were so friggin&#039; cute! The reason I started watching it in the first place was because of how cute these two characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review224781">
        in the cover looked! And as a guy who likes ecchi/harem, that&#039;s saying something! Even the way these two interact was adorable! Too adrable, in fact, that my heart couldn&#039;t take all the moe! It&#039;s a slow-paced romance, but that&#039;s what makes it so good! <br />
<br />
It was very fun to watch. Wether you be a guy or a girl, you&#039;d enjoy this too! It&#039;s just so nice to see a girly guy and a stalker fall in love with each other. And that&#039;s the love story of Momokuri!

Kurihara&#039;s love for Momotsuki isn&#039;t completely blind obsession. She directly voices her reasons for liking Momotsuki at least twice in the series, and it gave me a better feeling about their relationship. Some of her actions may still be alarming, but the series generally keeps an upbeat take on this type of love. Momotsuki returns Kurihara&#039;s feelings in a

<br />
There aren&#039;t any obvious miscommunications.<br />
Whenever a direct issue arises, Momotsuki has a conversation with Kurihara about it. There aren&#039;t many conflicts in this series, but it&#039;s nice that all of the obvious ones that do exist are dealt with directly. That also helps to give their relationship a healthier feeling.<br />
<br />
Pacing is actually amazingly good.<br />
I read some of the manga before I started watching the anime, so for the first several episodes, I could compare them to the chapters I had read. This series actually does a lot to make otherwise slow sections interesting to watch and feel decently-paced. For how easily the anime could have had pacing issues, pacing was handled very well in this adaptation.<br />
<br />
Good expressions and scene planning.<br />
Expressions are drawn very well. The scenes flow well and are shown from good angles. Even the filler sections [characters not on screen, sometimes a colored background] are done well [as a repeat of the &quot;pacing&quot; positive mentioned in this review].<br />
<br />
---- Negatives ----<br />
<br />
This ~is~ still about obsession love.<br />
At certain times, viewers are clearly reminded that Kurihara has some peculiar habits. Her friend, Mizuyama will usually be there to point out that Kurihara shouldn&#039;t be doing those things, but at times it can still feel a little odd.<br />
Opportunity for cancel: Yes. I never felt too uncomfortable because this aspect of Kurihara was usually shown in a humorous light, since many of her obsession scenes included another character who would react to what Kurihara was saying. Also, Kurihara and Momotsuki&#039;s relationship stays positive throughout the series.

    The premise of the show was interesting but they ultimately failed in trying to anything remotely interesting with the concept. It turned into a generic romance show with few of the quirks that would even define a stalker.<br />
<br />
The characters were pretty bland, cookie cutter choices from all the other anime you&#039;ve seen seen. Enter  the token loli, the confusing cousin relationship, the best friend, the tomboy et cetera.<br />
 <br />
If you came to watch a romance with little development and just cute labelled all over then this is for you, otherwise skip this. Nothing unique or noteworthy.<br />
<br />
If you do want something that does the stalker

    TL;DR: It&#039;s simple. It&#039;s cute.<br />
<br />
Most other romances try to keep you hooked with drama (sadly, often forged through stupid misunderstandings) and love rivalry. This one has nothing of that sort. If you&#039;d need to describe Momokuri in a single word, it&#039;d be &#039;cute&#039;.<br />
<br />
So, don&#039;t expect some deep backstories (you actually don&#039;t really learn anything about their past or their families) or some fancy plot. It&#039;s plain and simple; Girl asks boy out, boy accepts, they do stuff together. So, turn off your brain and enjoy a couple being cute (and awkward) together and having fun with their friends.<br />
<br />
Their personalities (including the side characters) and the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293998">
        obsessive stalker-like behavior of his girlfriend made it a pretty entertaining watch for me, even though there wasn&#039;t much going on.

    Momokuri is just a show that&#039;s trying really hard to be the cutest thing you&#039;ve ever seen.  Shy kids having a clumsy relationship full of forced misunderstandings and awkwardness.  And that&#039;s it.  There is nothing else to this show, once sentence is literally all you need to describe everything.   <br />
<br />
But while it&#039;s not depth incarnate, it does succeed in portraying some legitimate heart warming cuteness.  At first you may find the gags make you giggle or at least smile.  The chibi style drawings are pretty adorable and the voice work is excellent.  There&#039;s some goofy recorder music

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243061">
        here and there to add to the joyful ambiance, as in most similar shows.<br />
<br />
The problem is that it&#039;s just not enough.  The jokes are really sparse, and the rest of the show consists of, well, nothing.  Inner monologues, casual conversations about casual shit you don&#039;t care about, boring characters doing boring normal things.  All the &quot;filler&quot; produces no entertainment, and doesn&#039;t progress the story, since there is none, really.  Even the jokes are problematic, because as time passes, you will realize that you are just watching a slightly different flavor of the same gag.  <br />
<br />
The characters are pretty much reduced to their gimmick, as is often the case in low quality animes.  But they&#039;re still decently lovable, so i can tolerate it here.  My issue with these characters, as that if you didn&#039;t know their school year, you&#039;d have a really hard time speculating on how old they are.  Sometimes they act like grade schoolers, sometimes like teens, their appearance is overly childlike.  There&#039;s no adult characters which sucks some more realism out of the setting.  <br />
<br />
Don&#039;t bother with this, it&#039;s just not funny enough for its lack of substance. <br />
<br />

    I enjoyed this series very much!! &gt;///&lt; ♥<br />
..though it saddens me that I&#039;ve already completed this series :&#039;(<br />
<br />
I loved how the storyline focused on the lovestory of Momo and Kurihara! :D It didn&#039;t have a lot of fillers which I liked because I didn&#039;t get bored at all the whole time i was watching XD Though it&#039;s sad that each of the episodes were super short :&#039;( which kept me wanting for more! :&quot;)) <br />
<br />
The love story of Momo and Kurihara was very sweet and naive which I also liked a lot! X&quot;D ♥ I was able to relate well with the character of Yuki

          <span style="display: none;" id="review229070">
        which made the anime very close to my heart in an instant! XD Liking a boy from a far and going crazy about all the little things he does!! :)) ♥<br />
<br />
I wish to watch more anime like this! XD ♥ #Momokuri

    &lt;Before i start the review. i want to let you know that i mainly focus on slice of a life anime&#039;s. I will be reviewing all the slice of a life anime&#039;s i&#039;ve seen so far, so don&#039;t mind adding me as a friend if you are just like me a big fan of slice of a life anime&#039;s and want to discover more&gt; <br />
<br />
<br />
Urgh! Not another love highschool anime story! That&#039;s what the most people would think when they read about Momokuri. But i alway&#039;s think; YES! Finally another one to watch. <br />
<br />
To start with the beginning. It&#039;s not your typical Someone meet&#039;s on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review227414">
        school and during the complete anime they grow closer to eachother. And finally fall in love together and there&#039;s the happy end. This start&#039;s right away with that they like eachother. And show&#039;s how their relation continues.  So basically it an after story right away. <br />
<br />
As for the plot in the story, there are some mystery&#039;s. And yeah. For so far i&#039;ve seen (episode 15/16). It&#039;s actually a straight forward for me. I love brain breaker&#039;s, and mystery&#039;s that make&#039;s you curious about the meaning behind it. That&#039;s one thing i find dissapointing in this story. But even for the rest its a lovely dovely story. Nothing to weird and not to much focussed on fan service. Which is also important for me.  So i gave it a 7 for it.<br />
<br />
Art : <br />
I love this kind of style. No to realistic. But also not lazy art designer&#039;s. It&#039;s well drawned. Allot of details in the background. So that&#039;s also a good for me. worth a nice 7.<br />
<br />
Sound. <br />
For me it&#039;s simple. If the music keeps hanging in my head it&#039;s really good. If it make&#039;s me wanna learn it on the piano it&#039;s perfect. But this is not the case. It&#039;s decent. Fit&#039;s well in the situations. But sometimes they try to hard with squeeking sound effects that made me feel i&#039;m watching a 80&#039;s Tom and Jerry cartoon. It is decent enough. So a well deserved 7.<br />
<br />
Character&#039;s. <br />
I love the characters. Well almost then. They are the typical character&#039;s that you &#039;&#039;bond&#039;&#039; quick with. The girl is panicking really fast. And same goes as the boy. That lead&#039;s to funny moment&#039;s. But sometimes it get&#039;s annoying. I know in anime it&#039;s a big deal that it&#039;s really special to call someone to their first name. And that annoys me sometimes.  Holding hand&#039;s is a big deal. And that give&#039;s me the feeling that it&#039;s focussed on kid&#039;s around 8 year&#039;s. But again some situation&#039;s make&#039;s me feel that the show aim&#039;s for more adult people. So that&#039;s a bit confusing. But i really liked the characters so far. They are cute, funny , and easy to follow. That&#039;s the most important thing in anime right? Here you go MomoKuri, an 8 for the characters. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment. <br />
Like i stated before. i can really enjoy this story. It&#039;s different then those typically slice of a life romances because it starts straight away when they start their relation. And that&#039;s something i really like to see how a relation grow&#039;s bigger. And nice 8 for the enjoyment. <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall. <br />
Do you like slice of a life Anime&#039;s that show&#039;s how a relation grow&#039;s between characters? A silly story that&#039;s not just about the guy. But also about the girl. Then go watch it straight away! You wouldn&#039;t regret watching this. <br />
<br />

    Momokuri is a story about a budding young couple and the interactions that they have with each other and the characters around them. If the score wasn&#039;t any indication, I really liked this show, so I won&#039;t waste any time getting to why I did.<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
The story is about Momotsuki Shinya and Kurihara Yuki and their adventures as a couple, as such there is obviously not a huge focus on storyline. There&#039;s a story being followed, and there&#039;s a pretty good amount of progression, but it&#039;s nothing that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The ending has a nice resolution to everything,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239619">
        and the build up to it allows for the final scenes to really leave a lot more impact, so I would say that at the very least the story was effective at crafting a great ending.<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
Satelight did an amazing job animating this one. Everything is so vibrant and it&#039;s constantly moving. The animation simplifies itself during the more comedic and awkward moments, but it only serves to add to the comedy and never comes off as a cheap attempt to save money by not animating faces. From the pictures alone, you might be confused as to why I gave art a perfect score, since it seems like standard fare with it looking nice but not really stand out amazing. There&#039;s a lot of little things, but my biggest reason is one thing. The outfits. There&#039;s a huge variety of different clothing styles and outfits in each episode and each character has a specific style that their outfits all tailor to. The main cast all have at least 10 outfits, with the main couple probably wearing around 25 by the end of the series, and each one looks really nice and helps add a small touch of personality that really adds up by the end of the series.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
I usually care very little about the background music in a show, but there&#039;s a pretty good soundtrack here I think, there&#039;s a lot of generic quirky sounding songs, but there&#039;s also a fair selection of pretty piano pieces. The OP and ED are also major earworms, which is good because they&#039;re very nice songs. The voice acting definitely deserves the most praise though, every single actor conveys a very wide range of emotion extremely well, with some characters even having strategically placed voice cracks just to add to the awkwardness. Momotsuki&#039;s voice actor especially deserves props for their performance, as he sounds exactly like the character he&#039;s playing and his vocal range is constantly changing to match Momo&#039;s fluctuating emotions.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8<br />
Our main pair, Momo and Kuri are both very flawed characters (Kuri especially) who would be absolutely insufferable if it weren&#039;t for how the side characters react and change their relationship. The side characters all have very distinct personalities and their own mini arcs that allow them each to stand out, while also playing off of the main pair&#039;s relationship and creates even more comedy. The side characters, however, are also the biggest problem with this show. Many of them get development that leads to them having mini arcs amongst themselves, but NONE of them get any resolution. This is a really bad thing because it leaves so many questions in the air and since NO ONE WATCHED THIS SHOW, it is very unlikely that there will ever be a season 2, meaning that, at least for the side characters, this is a read the manga ending show. Although this is a pretty bad thing, since it is only really a problem with the side characters who are otherwise absolutely hilarious, it doesn&#039;t affect my score all that much.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
I loved this show so much. The relationship between Momo and Kuri is absolutely precious, and each episode led to so many great moments because the comedy plays out so well. I will say that if you don&#039;t like cringe comedy, you more than likely won&#039;t like this show because so much of the show is based on Kurihara&#039;s strange urges or Momo&#039;s extreme overreactions. If you can appreciate the comedy and like romance, then this show is 100% for you. It&#039;s cute and funny without being hampered down by the standard shoujo tropes since the characters start dating so early on.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
In conclusion, if you are tired and lonely on Valentine&#039;s Day and need something to do, then masturbate, but after you do that, if there&#039;s nothing else you have to do, which, let&#039;s face it, is likely since you watch anime, then I would absolutely recommend you check out Momokuri and slowly begin to feel the diabetes injected into your veins.

    I normally love short romance anime&#039;s because it normally packs in all the cute stuff and it&#039;s just really enjoyable to watch! But Momokuri just rubbed me the wrong way..<br />
<br />
Story 5/10: Okay so the story isn&#039;t terrible and it&#039;s not amazing.. It&#039;s a short and sweet romance story and that&#039;s all there is to it. It&#039;s nothing spectacular but it will never be bad simply because of how the plot is.. I mostly skipped through this anime due to the fact I started hating it pretty early on and I found it close to unbearable to watch, although I pulled through I wouldn&#039;t say hate..

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282647">
        But I strongly dislike it. Plot was made for a romance anime and that&#039;s all it was.<br />
<br />
Art 8/10: Now the art is fairly decent, I don&#039;t believe I&#039;ve watched any anime&#039;s that&#039;s close to this kind of animation style but it was really enjoyable and it really made for that cutesy feeling type.<br />
<br />
Sound 7/10: Sound was also fairly decent and when it came to sad/angry moments you could feel the suspense and you knew something was wrong. Nothing really stood out apart from that but nothing really felt out of place either.<br />
<br />
Character 5/10: Okay.. here we go! So Momo... Momo was actually fairly decent and he seemed like a decent MC for a romance story. Nothing I could say that I really hated him for because he made sense in my eyes apart from being abit dense at sometimes he seemed perfect for the role and fitted in fairly well. His personality was good and it seemed like he has emotions in check. His jealously moments were the best for me even though he&#039;d end up not following through almost every time I still really liked him. <br />
So now Kuri.. I absolutely hate this character... For an obsessed girl who&#039;s madly in love with the guy she had zero emotions apart from him being cute when girls around him were flirting with him. I completely understand that she&#039;s love blind for him but atleast have some sense of direction about this entire thing. I&#039;m completely with Momo, her jealously annoyed the hell out of me. The only thing I liked about her character is that she played the stalker part pretty well. She&#039;s dense and way to hyper. She&#039;s border like a pervert and if someone stepped into their circle would be like &quot;Holy s*** this b**** crazy!&quot; All I can say is that she&#039;s love blind and doesn&#039;t care what happens as long as Momo notices her...<br />
Side characters were fairly decent and played a decent role in to some of it.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 4/10: I don&#039;t recommend this to anyone who likes to get involved with the anime... By this I mean like looking at it in a serious and realistic point of view. Because that&#039;s what I did.. :P

    This is a slow paced story about a young, innocent couple who went about discovering romance and figuring how relationship works together.<br />
<br />
A few notable things about this show:<br />
- The girl MC is kind of a stalker and can becomes really creepy at times.<br />
- The guy MC is very innocent and kind of oblivious (though later episodes revealed that he&#039;s not really as oblivious as we thought).<br />
- The characters act somehow too innocent despite being a highschoolers.<br />
- The slow pacing is seriously Very slow.<br />
<br />
That being said, I think this show is not really for everyone. However I think you&#039;ll enjoy this show if you:<br />
- Like romance

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297939">
        shows with overall happy tone and little to none conflicts.<br />
- Like romance shows that explore the relationship rather than going through journey of getting the characters to become a couple.<br />
- Like romance shows with adorable innocent characters.<br />
- Like moe character designs.<br />
<br />
I going to be honest, I didn&#039;t ended up enjoy this show for some subjective reasons (such as my dislike of the character designs, etc.). Though there are some things that I really like from this show:<br />
- The unusual and unexpected MC&#039;s personality.<br />
- The fact that no one hate the main girl for her creepy and stalker-ish personality.<br />
- The overall color palette.<br />
<br />
<br />

    I expected this anime to have little plot and a lot of comedy, and was surprised to find that it had a good amount of decent plot and not a lot of good comedy. The plot was much better than I expected. The main couple are both very interesting characters, with Yuki being the more interesting of the two, but the aspects of Momo that allow him to accept Yuki and the backstory of how he gained such characteristics was interesting as well. It&#039;s a relationship that works really well, making a pretty solid point relating to how in what ways people love each other, express their love, and wish to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295630">
        loved in return may not be the same, but even if they are different they can be just as strong and match well. Furthermore, the harmless stalker thing was adorable. The pacing was fine in a really general sense, if you just look at what content each episode contained. However, the problem was that it didn&#039;t have much filling in the moments between the moments that mattered, and the moments that mattered were somewhat slow, so the show still felt like it was dragging on quite a bit. Maybe this issue arises from being reformatted 24  minute episodes from 12 minute episodes, but the problem is definitely there. This brings me to the other thing I was surprised about relating to this show, that it didn&#039;t have a lot of good comedy. There was definitely comedy, and some of it was even good, but it needed more as what was there wasn&#039;t enough to prevent the show from feeling quite dull at times. They could have filled it in other ways, such as with side stories about the various friends, which while present felt more like hints that didn&#039;t go anywhere at all. Or maybe even just more events happening that ultimately have the same points as the events that were there. Regardless of what, it needed something more, or it needed to be compressed to be shorter.  <br />
<br />
In terms of art style, it was solid enough. The animation was pretty weak though, and overall it felt quite low budget. The same applied to the soundtrack as well, though the OP/ED both in terms of visuals and audio were decent enough. <br />
<br />
tl;dr: A show that is pretty slow and doesn&#039;t have great comedy but has a surprisingly strong plot.

    First things first. My &quot;reviews&quot; system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.<br />

Had a bit tough time choosing between scoring 6 or 7, I usually love absolutely cute stuff + romance on top of that. (ex: &quot;Acchi Kocchi&quot; is something I truly adored), but with this Anime &quot;something&quot; did not &quot;click&quot; with me and I couldn&#039;t figure out what was that. But I like praising with score more, thus decided giving 7.<br />
<br />
Anyhow. Story is simple enough, It&#039;s about cute couple being overly cute and awkward. Getting nervous on simple things and being worried whenever their weird or perverted. I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256154">
        did enjoy it for the most part. I wouldn&#039;t say its any bad. Its cute, simple and enjoyable. If if should have any complaint, then it would that I felt it should have ended with a bit more progress regarding their love relationship. I mean, It ended well and innocent. But would have been better with a tad bit more. Story&#039;wise maybe &quot;progression&quot; of side-characters or so felt a bit weak too. Mostly it was cute reaction lasting a while, which probably is the part that took the whole &quot;screentime&quot;<br />
<br />
Art was great, it was cute, bright and cheerful. Whilst music/ost part of the anime I would say was quite average. I absolutely felt no presence of OST if there even was any, and opening/ending theme didn&#039;t really impress me either.<br />
<br />
Characters were enjoyable, nothing too impressive, but enjoyable. We got main shy guy who is quite girly. And a cute girl who is obsessed of her boyfriend. Side-characters were also quite nice. We got girl with a nice voice that has &quot;straightman comedy&quot; persona. We got an odd pseudo-couple, that consist of forgetting boy that cares about her little childhood friend who acts like elementary schooler. Also we got prince type of a girl and some cute &quot;normals&quot;. Variation is satisfying enough, their presence is good enough. And overall I enjoyed side-characters.<br />
<br />
So to sum it all up, it&#039;s a great little glittery overly cute romance anime. It got lacking part of some character progression, maybe. A bit weaker side of music. Enjoyable, but something did not &quot;click&quot; with me thus the difficulty with scoring I had.

    In Momokuri we take a peek at the life of Kurihara Yuki and Momotsuki Shinya, as they begin dating - they start dating from episode 1 - they go though many different things, such as new emotions that they didn&#039;t knew existed, make happy and sad memories, celebrate Christmas and each others Birthdays, look after each other in times of sickness and being together in times of hardship - not that there is a lot of hardships or anything. This show is drama free with no hard emotions, it only contains happiness and rainbow so there is no need to worry about our couple and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review253485">
        just watch it in a carefree way.<br />
<br />
The show is Slice of Life in nature - tho the Slice of Life element kind of fails, each episode we follow our couple as they go through their daily life and experience the taste of being in love. Both of them are innocent when it comes to love which results in a lot of blushing and awkward moments. Sometimes the narrator changes from Yuki to Shinya and vice versa, as the narrator changes we get to see what they are thinking and understand their perspectives.<br />
<br />
Shinya goes through some character development while Yuki pretty much doesn&#039;t change, there is no story or plot either. There is a bit of character conflict through the end but it is nothing major. Our characters personalities pop up here and there but most of the time it falls flat, Yuki especially gets almost no personality at all, while Shinya is more complete. The characters seem too narrow, too stuffed, if that makes sense. The flow of the story seems to carry the characters rather then characters acting on their own. It seems that certain things happen because they must happen rather then because the character acted that way. In a way they don&#039;t seem alive and because of this I can&#039;t really empathize with them, I understand their emotions and reasons for doing the things they did but these emotions don&#039;t seem real and feel more fake. If our characters weren&#039;t a couple then there would be nothing more left in them and that is why the characters seem like they are not complete. I did enjoy the character interactions anyway, when they get together their interactions are more alive and full of emotion. The problem with the characters can be overlooked if you are just here to enjoy a sweet and cute romance without bothering too much about anything else.<br />
<br />
The main selling point is the character interactions, mainly our couple. It is almost always filled with blushes and cute interactions, both do not know how to act around each other and sometimes feel awkward and clumsy. The whole thing feels innocent and pure. The comedy isn&#039;t strong and because of the problem with the characters the Slice of Life fails, since they don&#039;t behave like an individual.<br />
<br />
If you wish to watch a soothing, cute and innocent show about two people falling in love then give this one a try, it has its weaknesses but the strong points are big enough that you can overlook the weaknesses and still enjoy. If you wish to have well written characters, comedy or good Slice of Life then you should avoid this one.<br />
