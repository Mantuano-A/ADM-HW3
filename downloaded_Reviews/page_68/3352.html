    This is one of the worst adaptation to ever come out in recent memory. Not only it&#039;s a bad anime, but it&#039;s also an insult to the original manga by Fujita-sensei which is considered a classic in Japan.<br />
 <br />
Let&#039;s go over the biggest problem: it&#039;s rushed like hell. <br />
How rushed? Well... <br />
Imagine if you had to adapt JoJo part 5 into 13 episodes...<br />
Or HxH  into 24 episodes... <br />
Or FMA into 16 episodes... <br />
Or... Well, you get the idea. <br />
The original manga is 43 volume long. This anime is 36 episode. <br />
This means that even if they adapted a volume per episode, it wouldn&#039;t do

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311544">
        it. So they had two choices: either cut whole volumes or cut small content. They choose both. <br />
<br />
Now to the problems that this causes: it&#039;s a mess. <br />
There is barely any characterization for the characters we are supposed to care about, and the character development is so sudden it makes no sense. Characters will do things that they would normally never do for no reason at all because of it. <br />
The story also just keeps jumping nonstop from one point to another, dramatic moments will happen with no build-up whatsoever and sad songs will play at a sad moment that no one cares about. <br />
<br />
Technically speaking, it&#039;s also ugly. Character movements are too stiff, actions scenes barely have any action and are just static shots of a character delivering an attack. Excessive post-effects are added to some scenes and they also look ugly (for example, the white bloom that is present through the whole hospital arc fight). <br />
<br />
 It also manages to have a terrible directing and editing. Characters will just stand somewhere or walk while talking with nothing happening on-screen (as in episode 4 when two character are talking on the side walk), some cuts are TOO SUDDEN (episode 13 cuts to the opening all of sudden almost as if it wanted to make a cliffhanger, but it just made it worse)  and the narrative in general is really just too much simplified.<br />
<br />
As I re-write this review, all  of my points are still valid and the show has only gotten WORST. It&#039;s downright offensive to the viewers and to the original material. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s not much too say. It&#039;s just a really bad and insulting show. A real waste of good source material. <br />
<br />
TL;DR do yourself a favor and read the great manga

    People evolve. We venture beyond our comfort zones, adapting and adjusting to new environments. In the end, we become better versions of ourselves. However, for the shirogane (masters of magical puppets), this is not the case. Defined by their silver hair, slim figures, and seemingly ageless bodies, they’ve been fighting monsters for hundreds of years. Their reasoning for this lies within a traumatizing event from long ago; this event permanently affected them. While the seasons change, the shirogane stay the same. It&#039;s apparent in their fighting style (the manipulation of puppets). With the issues they confront, the shirogane insist on an approach that’s not only

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311538">
        unreliable but is also (more or less) outdated. To me, the shirogane are frozen in time.<br />
<br />
The same can be said of Karakuri Circus. Like the shirogane, this show is from a bygone era. July 9, 1997 was when Karakuri Circus first emerged, as the brainchild of mangaka Kazuhiro Fujita. And although it was recently adapted into an anime (thanks to Studio VOLN), the premise is typical of the era it hails from. At the outset, we’re introduced to Masaru Saiga (a timid soul with a big heart and a photographic memory), alongside his companions Narumi and Eleonore. Loyalty is established (and romance blossoms) as they voyage through a coming-of-age tale involving daddy issues, the power of friendship, and eventually saving the world. This did not grab my attention (at least, not at first). For me, the overarching story is redeemed when it connects to its various subplots, specifically the shirogane’s struggles against the automata.<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s where the magic unfolds. Masaru’s journey may be this show’s backbone, but it’s in the feud between these two factions that Karakuri Circus comes alive. Their various showdowns are engaging to watch, mostly thanks to composer Yuki Hayashi (he’s the brains behind the soundtracks for Haikyuu and My Hero Academia). It’s because of him that, for each action sequence, viewers are blessed with a colorful array of accordions, drums, and guitars. And the fights themselves are quite impressive. The puppets that the shirogane weaponize and maneuver are rendered in stunning CGI. Gaudy explosions often follow the attacks these fighters unleash (at one point, a column of fire erupts as lightning bolts dance around it). And the battles end stylishly; it’s mesmerizing to watch the automata crumble piece by piece, under grey ooze and hissing steam. <br />
<br />
Fight scenes are this show&#039;s pride and joy. However, what&#039;s said during these fight scenes isn&#039;t always as inspiring. As far as dialogue is concerned, there are certain areas I enjoy; the one-liners here are very much appreciated and the soul-stirring speeches are genuine highlights, especially in the final six episodes. On the other hand, this show is held back by a hamfisted screenplay; the dialogue is both excessive and redundant, often emphasizing the most obvious ideas. Karakuri Circus provides character development but not without pointlessly detailing the process. It presents ingenious tactics but not without long-winded explanations of how they work. It features personality traits (like Eleonore&#039;s weaknesses or a hospital patient&#039;s hobbies), but not without an extended monologue about them soon after. For most shonens, infodumping is a recurring issue, and Karakuri Circus is no exception.<br />
<br />
Ideally, these monologues would be reduced (if not removed entirely). Studio VOLN, though, were occupied elsewhere, with modifying the manga’s overall storyline. Looking to comply with the 36-episode format, they condensed the events of the source material, disposing of specific plot threads in the process. Among others, the Beast Tamer arc and the Kuroga Village training period were axed. Although it caused complaints (especially from fans of the manga), the differences, for the most part, aren’t too severe. To be clear, the editing process and the end result are by no means perfect, but they don&#039;t detract from the overall experience. By holding onto the original’s ideas and themes, Karakuri Circus remains true to Fujita’s vision.<br />
<br />
- - - - - - -<br />
<br />
It’s a mess. The table is cluttered with mess; it&#039;s practically submerged in folders, calculators, pencil shavings, ink stains, and rough sketches. However, Kazuhiro Fujita and his three assistants ignore this. An idea has caught their attention instead. “Aren’t there idiots who get excited just from being on a cliff?” Fujita wonders aloud. He then rises from his chair, gesturing with his hands to emphasize the point he’s making. After doing this, a voice intones, “For Fujita-san, if he’s not talking to people, then it appears he cannot progress in his work.”<br />
<br />
Kazuhiro Fujita is a featured guest on “Urasawa Naoki no Manben,” a 2015 documentary series that captures a mangaka’s journey in creating their material; it’s intended to provide a glimpse into the process’ inner workings. In the documentary, Fujita and his assistants are filmed at work for four days. When this is finished, Naoki Urasawa (Manben’s host) and Fujita convene to examine the footage.<br />
<br />
While doing so, they discuss a variety of manga-related topics. Naturally, the conversation shifts to detailing the early stages of Fujita’s career. At the age of 25, he was hired by Shonen Sunday and soon after he reviewed what they had to offer. Fujita scrutinized the magazine’s catalog, a lineup of sports stories and romantic comedies, and he wanted to invigorate the ranks with something new. In order to succeed, he derived inspiration from his childhood influences.<br />
<br />
Ever since his days growing up in Asahikawa, Fujita loved reading manga, especially shonens. At the time, he was entranced by series like Shotaro Ishinomori’s “Kamen Rider,” Go Nagai’s “Devilman,” and Ken Ishikawa’s “Getter Robo.” However, out of all his childhood influences, there was one that towered above the rest: Rumiko Takahashi’s “Yami wo Kakeru Manazashi.”<br />
<br />
“It was a short story with regular humans that fought the weird and won. I thought ‘Oh, I am really glad she drew something like this.’ Like, ‘This is just the kind of thing I want to read!’ It was the kind of thing that made me think ‘Manga’s amazing!’ And I think it was the thing that turned me on to doing manga”, - Kazuhiro Fujita<br />
<br />
- - - - - - -<br />
<br />
This idea would define him. Throughout his career of thirty years and counting, Fujita waged war against the unknown. In his stories, he would maneuver his everyman leads into confronting opponents of unnatural origin, like evil spirits (in Ushio to Tora), fairy-tale denizens (in Moonlight Act), and sentient haunted houses (in Souboutei Kowasubeshi). With Karakuri Circus, it’s the automata that adopt this role. However, there’s a crucial difference between this show and the rest of Fujita’s works. Beneath the speeches, the references to Chinese culture and the slapstick comedy lies Karakuri Circus’s true intent: to find common ground between the shirogane and automata through their goals. For the shirogane, that goal is learning from the past. After centuries of failure, they finally abandon their age-old stubbornness, which causes them to evolve both in combat (with a wider range of styles and tactics) and outside of it (with more openness in their personal relations). As for the automata, their purpose isn’t as detailed. There’s a backstory here but it’s a strange one, almost impossible to make sense of. Regardless, this show succeeds in providing both sides a cause worth fighting for. It’s not much but having this makes it easier to understand the automata.<br />
<br />
However, this show fails to humanize them. Excluding the Les Quatre Pioneers (the four oldest automata) and a few others, there&#039;s no reason for anyone to care about them. These guys are cartoonishly evil. They kill for sport, getting off on the worst of bloodbaths. In battle, their signature move is to take the children and slap them around before using them as bargaining chips. If children aren’t nearby, they’ll resort to removing women&#039;s clothing and gloating about it afterward. The automata are caricatures, plain and simple; they’re card-carrying villains, cruel for cruelty’s sake, cackling at the chaos they’ve created. And they’re not the only ones like this. In Karakuri Circus, almost every antagonist is written the same way. From Zenji Saiga (Masaru’s uncle) to episode 16’s suicidal samurai and even the main villain himself, they’re all reduced to stereotype, burdened with bloated egos and creepy facial expressions.<br />
<br />
This black-and-white worldview cripples the show&#039;s storytelling. It&#039;s also an issue that&#039;s appeared in Fujita&#039;s writing from the start.<br />
<br />
People evolve. We venture beyond our comfort zones, adapting and adjusting to new environments. In the end, we become better versions of ourselves. However, for Kazuhiro Fujita, this is not the case. Defined by his haunting imagery, two-dimensional villains, and references to Chinese culture, he’s been drawing manga for thirty years. His reasoning for this lies within a short story from long ago; this story permanently affected him. While the seasons change, Fujita stays the same. It&#039;s apparent in his writing style. With the stories he creates, Fujita insists on an approach that’s not only flawed but is also (more or less) outdated. To me, Kazuhiro Fujita is frozen in time.<br />
<br />
The same can be said of Karakuri Circus. Like Fujita, this anime is from a bygone era. And it shows, what with its archaic sense of humor and its bright-red line between good and evil. There&#039;s little room for nuance here, the shades of grey few and far between. However, what Karakuri Circus lacks in subtlety, it compensates with heart. The stories here truly inspire. They are love letters to the human spirit, songs of triumph over our past failings and grievances. And although they&#039;re constrained by cliches, I&#039;ll always remember these tales of personal growth, especially the ones I least expected.

    Over the past decade since I’ve been reading manga, there’s one author that I always felt underappreciated. Kazuhiro Fujita is the manga artist responsible for works such as Ushio and Tora and Moonlight Act. It’s not his first rodeo of having an anime adaptation. Ushio and Tora got the treatment of a 3-cour show (with a split break) based on his manga. Both series ran a large chunk of chapters before their conclusion. Karakuri Circus takes place in modern Japan focusing on a young boy named Masaru Saiga. <br />
<br />
The story itself contains elements of action and dark fantasy while the plot revolves with three protagonists.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311535">
        Masaru, Narumi, and Shirogane may all have different personalities but their roles are all pivotal for the integrity of the plot. Masaru’s inheritance from his family paints a target on his back as people are after his money. Narumi and Shirogane saves Masaru from death but also begins a complicated story as their lives changes forever. Make no mistake, Karakuri Circus is actually more complex as it seems on the surface. My original impression of Karakuri Circus felt like the anime managed to do what it could do to get the story flowing. However, several episodes in the early stages begin showing red flags.<br />
<br />
To put it bluntly, this anime adaptation went way over the speed limit in the beginning. It’s incredibly rushed and skipping many chapters to get to certain plot elements. Just for statistical references, the first four or so episodes adapted at least 25+ chapters. With 43 volumes, this didn’t come to me as a complete surprise. The staff probably wanted to cover the entire manga but by doing so, it also damages the original product as a whole. This glaring red flag told me that Karakuri Circus is a victim of modern day adaptations. What got me curious is why the show didn’t receive more episodes in the first place. Perhaps a split double cour could even remedy this a little but instead, we get a continuous triple cour of 36 episodes. If you think about it, that’s almost 11 chapters per episode if we go with the flow. Luckily, the anime doesn’t exactly go with such numbers but it still suffers from omission. As a fan of the manga, I’m rather dumbfounded.<br />
<br />
Onto the actual plot, Karakuri Circus seems to have a vision to dive deep into its background story. Events in the past heavily influences the present timeline with characters such as Shirogane based on past incarnations. What began 200 years ago has made powerful impact in the present story. However, the first few episodes didn’t follow such format. Instead, it focused more on our three protagonists attempting to live a normal life. Despite that, fate has linked them together with the past that’s practically inescapable. As more episodes progressed, there’s a so much revealed that it’s hard to take in all at once. This the second red flag of the anime. How can viewers be invested in so much content going on at once? Now, I do get that Karakuri Circus relies on character decisions. Some of these are so important that they change the outcome of the story. But really, it feels that the story goes into many directions rather than being focused in one direction. Unfortunately, that’s not all the problems it suffers.<br />
<br />
When it comes to characters, the cast itself begins to show weakness. Now on the surface, I do like our main characters. Masaru, Narumi, and Shirogane shares a unique bond together that’s hard to overlook in the beginning. There’s hints of deeper feelings between Narumi and Shirogane while Masaru and Shirogane also develops a close bond. The main problem though lies with its commitment to the characters. We are shown many flashbacks throughout the show that sometimes makes me forget our main characters. The first few episodes made me invest a lot into them but by the time half this show aired, that interest has greatly degenerated. That is, I don’t want to say the characters in the past are not important. On the contrary, they play huge roles such as the case with Francine, the Bai brothers, and members of the Saiga family. Two characters of the past also greatly resemble our main characters – Francine/Shirogane and Narumi/Bai Yin. There’s also emotional value poured into the relationships between certain characters. But as the more I watched the show, the more I felt detached with them. I wanted the anime to just be more focused in one direction and not jump back and forth between every episode. That seems a bit too much to ask because the anime adaptation had other ideas. <br />
<br />
But still, I do applaud Karakuri Circus for its expansive characters when it comes to diversity. While the anime adaptation suffers from rushed content, certain characters do make an impression. The Saiga family such as Shogi and Angelina are names that shouldn’t be forgotten easily during their arc. Members of the Midnight Circus has unique members with a variety of personalities. Furthermore, some of the antagonists in the show have impactful influences such as the Faceless Commander in later episodes. Hell, the Bai brother are responsible for causing a major story plot in the show – the Zonapha Syndrome. Known for its deadly stages, this syndrome is one of the most important elements in the entire series. So despite the story being rushed, it’s hard to deny that certain characters had great influence in the overall tone of the plot. If only the anime adaptation devoted more time on the plot to be more fluid and tolerable. Too bad. <br />
<br />
Founded in the August of 2014, studio VOLN had previously worked on Ushio and Tora. For its visual context, Karakuri Circus blends between old school art and new school. What I mean is that the show retains a style of the manga while also able to adapting it to modern standards. Character designs are crafted with precision and uniqueness. Every character seems to stand out on their own without feeling out of place. The most unique designs are the automatas, clowns, and circus acrobats. Many of the modern circus characters have a flamboyant look while the automata gives the impression of unique old school machines. Furthermore, I think praise should be given to the character expressions for being able to sell emotional content when it’s given the chance. The main characters such as Masaru and Narumi are prominent examples of this especially in early episodes. Later on, Shirogane’s emotions becomes much more apparent too. The bottom line is, VOLN managed to make a show that managed to live up to its visual expectations.<br />
<br />
Karakuri Circus is honestly a mixed bag of sometimes being great at what it does and other times falling short. Anyone who have read the manga will recognize how much the adaptation decided to skip content to get the main story going. That itself is a mistake and is hard to fix. If you came in as an anime original viewer, this might not be such a sour experience. As for me, this was more or less an average anime that could have been much, much more.

    We’ve seen shounen about ninjas, pirates, wizards, but I bet you haven’t seen one about the circus?!<br />
<br />
Karakuri Circus is the latest shounen revolving around puppets and the circus. It sounds interesting conceptually and Karakuri Circus is more grounded than your typical battle shounen, however it still falls into the same pitfalls that plagues most shounen.<br />
<br />
Story: (4/10)<br />
The story is about a boy named Masaru who has inherited his late father’s fortune. However, a group of people wielding these mysterious puppets are after him trying to get their hands on it. Through a sequence of events he meets Narumi and his puppeteer guardian named Shirogane. Together they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295271">
        try to rescue and protect Masaru.<br />
<br />
Based off the premise and watching the first few episodes I was skeptical about  this anime because I knew Masaru was going to be used as a plot device and play the weak, useless, ‘damsel in distress’ role. I’m pleased to say that doesn’t seem to be the case. <br />
<br />
Characters: (6/10):<br />
Masaru is your typical weak crybaby who’s no different to Deku from MHA.<br />
<br />
Narumi is a muscular man who’s a Kung fu expert and has zonapha syndrome: a illness where he needs to make people laugh or he’ll die. He fills the ‘stronger, more confident’ aniki (older brother) role. Personally, I find him to be the most interesting and fun to watch. <br />
<br />
Shirogane is beautiful, strong and loyal to Masaru. She’s the most developed and complex character in the show so far. I’m interested in her character arc- developing from a woman who’s been shaped by her tragic upbringing into believing she’s nothing more than a puppet.<br />
<br />
Animation (6/10):<br />
The art is pretty mediocre and nothing really standout about it. <br />
<br />
The fights are subpar. Narumi’s supposed to have learnt Kung fu, but you couldn’t tell that with the  choreography since he just looks like a big muscular dude beating people up. The fights between puppeteers is weak. Instead of taking the opportunity for creative fights involving strategy, we get some boring fight scenes where they call out special moves. It doesn’t help that Jojo part 5 is running at the same time because it’s like watching a less interesting version of stands being used. <br />
<br />
Sound (6/10):<br />
The opening &amp; ending song are catchy and the visuals are good since it doesn’t spoil much of the series. However, I can’t remember any of the osts. That should tell you how uninspired and forgettable they were. <br />
<br />
Overall (4/10):<br />
I originally was going to rate Karakuri Circus higher because the story started off well, but it goes downhill quickly after the first tragic event. There’s a lot of bad writing and inconsistent moments in the show, that my suspension of disbelief was broken:<br />
<br />
Masaru’s development from a crybaby to a boy who doesn’t cry anymore and has the eyes of a beast would have been good if it didn’t happen in the span of three episodes... I’m not saying take as long as Deku, but his development is too unrealistic given the timespan. <br />
<br />
Narumi’s so strong that he’s able to break cage bars... well why didn’t he do that in the first place? If he’s so strong why couldn’t he break the strings?<br />
<br />
How did Masaru survive jumping out of a building and landing on tree branches with no broken bones? How is this same Masaru who’s covered in blood now able to fight while Shirogane’s injured in her legs? Neither should be able to move.<br />
<br />
How is Masaru able to wield puppets when it’s supposed to take years of experience to master?<br />
<br />
How did Masaru survive the burning building? He should have died from lack of oxygen due to inhaling too much smoke or from the building collapsing on them. In fact how wasn’t Narumi’s arm not burnt to ash?<br />
<br />
If Shirogane had Aqua Vitae all along, then why didn’t she share her blood with Masaru when he was injured throughout the rescue arc? <br />
<br />
Why does Narumi have a white strand of hair?  <br />
<br />
Beast Tamer girl controls the strongest beasts that the enemy tamer hasn’t been able to all his life, by just staring at them and saying one word? What ability does she have because it’s clearly not the sharingan. No explanation is given.<br />
I was never emotionally invested in Beast Tamer girl and her rushed storyline, because of how little screentime she got to begin with.<br />
<br />
It’s clear to me that the anime is skipping a lot of content from the source material. As a result the pacing is a mess, events aren’t flowing well, there’s a lot of unexplained plot points and underdeveloped characters e.g. Ming-xia, the villains. Characters are being introduced one episode (the faceless &amp; the Shirogane Os), only for them to die the next episode without being properly fleshed out.<br />
<br />
The long backstory relating to Francine/Eleonore/Sadoyoshi/Masaru’s ancestors etc. was too convoluted and bad writing to explain character’s motivations. Faceless being the mastermind behind everything with his plan to download his memories into Masaru is the worst case of Aizen’s “all according keikaku”. It wasn’t hinted that Faceless even wanted to take over the world and his obsession with Eleanore is creepy. He continues to top himself coming up with more nonsensical plans like sending himself and Shirogane into space to be together, to the point it becomes comical. He’s the definition of a Saturday morning, mustache twirling evil villain.   <br />
<br />
Karakuri Circus had potential at the start, but ultimately was ruined by the terrible pacing and bad writing.

    SOOOO UNDERRATED. i really enjoy this anime it oddly gives hunterxhunter vibes idk how but its mt opnion the story is so fit and everything is connected <br />
in the first episodes you wont understand that much but trust me it all will be shown in the next episodes...the art is likeable not like those 2018 animes that they draw characters to look childish and stupidly personality big eyes and etc...<br />
i really like the art and the colors..the sounds are great makes the fights scensess more exiting...enjoyment is perfect..no episode made me feel bored its just all exiting and holds u to the next episode...overall 10\10

    I would like to preface this review by saying that I have yet to read the Karakuri Circus manga, so I will be discussing the show on its own merits, rather than comparing it to the manga. That said, there are lots of elements to Karakuri Circus that make it clear that it cut out a lot of stuff from the manga. This anime serves as a case study as to what happens when you adapt a great manga (or, at least, I assume it’s great based on what I’ve seen of the anime) from 42 volumes into 36 episodes. As you might imagine, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311546">
        result is a bit messy.<br />
<br />
If I were to choose two adjectives to describe Karakuri Circus, I would go with “creative” but “rushed”. The plot is full of all sorts of brilliant and entertaining ideas, but it breezes through them so quickly that few of them really hit you with the impact they deserve. This also applies to the characters of the show. This show has an enormous cast, but few of them get enough screen time. To the show’s credit, there are still many great ideas, moments and characters, but if either there was a greater number of episodes, or the focus of the 36 episodes we do have was more narrowed, then these would’ve been more effective as a result of being more thoroughly developed.<br />
<br />
The circus motif of the series is going to be hit or miss depending on your personal tastes, but I for one think it’s great. Karakuri Circus does a great job capitalizing on different elements of the circus, creating lots of unique and entertaining puppets to be fought throughout the series. The way they twist the joyful and comedic look of the circus into something much more abhorrent is very well done. If you are afraid of clowns, then these designs will definitely add to the atmosphere of the series.<br />
<br />
These designs, as well as the varied abilities of the puppets make the fights pretty entertaining. These fights are usually quite simple, but usually have an emotionally resonant idea or important stakes in the plot that comes with them. There is also always a tangible sense of tension once it becomes clear that this series isn’t afraid to kill off its characters. In many cases, however, these things feel like they could’ve hit harder if the characters involved had received more development, and things start to feel formulaic after a while. The animation is also pretty underwhelming.<br />
<br />
The character deaths feel particularly formulaic (with exceptions). This is perhaps where the incredibly fast-paced nature of the show hurts it the most. Because of this pace, character deaths happen so frequently that the deaths of minor characters don’t have the impact they ought to, and the more major deaths feel less shocking (though they still hit pretty hard).<br />
<br />
In terms of presentation, Karakuri Circus is pretty solid. As I said earlier, it has underwhelming animation, but it is still pretty nice, visually speaking, as a result of the puppet designs and the classic ‘90s aesthetic. As for the audio side of things, the BGM is pretty darn great, as are the opening and ending themes, and the voice actors do a nice job at conveying their characters.<br />
<br />
The most recurring theme throughout the series is that of smiling (and, by extension, laughter). While this may sound pretty cliché, it fits the series rather well, in large part due to the circus motif. After all, the point of the circus is to make people smile. This idea is twisted and perverted by the villains of the series, adding a lot more to this theme than you might expect. While it certainly also indulges in the cliché elements of this theme, the accompaniment of this dark parallel makes these moments feel richer. I can certainly say that this theme, and the show in general, succeeded in making me smile.<br />
<br />
Most of Karakuri Circus’ problems seem to come from how rushed it is. It oozes creativity and heart, but so much of it feels as though it could’ve been executed a lot better had it been given more episodes. I have yet to read the manga, so I am hesitant to recommend it, but I will say this: if the manga is truly like the anime but with a much slower pace, then I am reasonably confident that it will be an excellent read.<br />
<br />
So, should you watch Karakuri Circus? I would say that it depends on how interested you are in the series. If a battle shounen between mechanical puppets with a strong circus motif interests you enough that you are convinced it is worth your time, you should probably read the manga instead. However, if you are somewhat interested, but think that a 42-volume manga is too big of a commitment, then you should definitely check out the anime! Who knows? Perhaps you will like it enough that you will be convinced to read the manga? I certainly plan on reading it.<br />

    Finally the 36 episode long anime has ended and it ended with a clean ending, not something that every anime does which always leaves an open ending, that the good part, the bad part about this anime was that to run for 36 episode was just too much of a chore, since we have to see a lot of back stories and info dump that were seemingly pseudo-science by nature, in one episode about the backstory of Yin and Bin it was 1758, that was the &quot; Renaissance&quot; that was the time that moden medicine was starting to develop in it&#039;s early stage, that was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311835">
        the time when modernity was in it&#039;s infancy , so how did a Chinese guy like Bai  who traveled from China to Europe able to to created an virus or some kind of nanotech that gave people such disease like ZONAPHA , with tools that weren&#039;t  even invented and how did he develop a stone that can heal the same disease  when alchemy wasn&#039;t an accurate science, in fact the philosopher stone that them alchemist were developing never come to light , now I don;t know about you people but I beginning to think that the original creator of this thing, Fujita, Kazuhiro can be a bit &quot;NUTS&quot; when he came up with this kind of thing, but then again see how this in its manga form did was a success, but in its anime form, it does have a lotta plot holes that sometimes it can be annoying, especially when common sense was put aside for something elaborate that basically makes  it too stupid to comprehend , also those puppets that can move and think, WTF  they&#039;re just made out of wood or simple material , so how come they can do that , I mean it&#039;s not like that Bai aka Faceless to be able to develop &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot;  that was basically crazy, now don&#039;t tell me it&#039;s magic , cu&#039;z if it is then Masaru , Narumi, and Eleanor ought to be wizards or magic user. Art, basically since the anime debuted in the late 90&#039;s it wasn&#039;t  surprising that everything there were based in that era, but unfortunately, that idiot of the original creator, Fujita, Kazuhiro, should have included cellphones, since they exist already in the late 90&#039;s like that fold up phone, also, on the character side of this thing basically has too many antagonist and too many protagonist , yet thought it would only be Masru, Narumi, and Eleanor, the addition of other support like Cuy, Vilma, Pataleon and others were just too much to comprehend that sometimes you felt lost as to who is who around here, so without anymore bullshit, here were my ratings for this anime:<br />
<br />
Story-Good 7: Since , there is that plot about a grow up like Narumi saving Masaru from the greedy Saiga family , it was good at first but this change when Narumi disappears and that&#039;s where the pseudo sci-fi thing begins as the world was threatened by a disease called ZONAPHA and the attack of the puppets  that can think without any AI tech in them. <br />
<br />
Art- fair 6: There was limited fanservices and mostly were about them puppets with a  hotch·potch of design that were just too lame to to consider cu&#039;z they&#039;re not even funny.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- Fair 6: This anime maybe interesting,  but I can&#039;t just ignore the plot holes.<br />
<br />
Overall- Good 7: That&#039;s for the clean ending.<br />
<br />
<br />

    I&#039;ll start by saying that I think this series is a blast. If you like shonen anime like I do, especially the kind that hit you in the feels and hold no punches, I highly recommend it.<br />
<br />
Karakuri Circus is an adaptation of a shonen manga from the 90s, coming from the same author of Ushio to Tora. It tells the story of Masaru, a kid raised by a rich family who just inherited a big fortune, since the father of the household died in a car crash. As a result, Masaru is being pursued by two separate groups of puppeteers who control super strong puppets

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316234">
        that can kill people at the drop of a hat. <br />
I&#039;m not sure I should point this out, but this is a hot blooded, over the top series where some suspension of disbelief is required.<br />
<br />
With that out of the way, I&#039;d like to go over both the series&#039; strengths as well as its weaknesses, specifically when it comes to being a condensed, 36 episode adaptation of its 43 volume long manga which might be the reason this anime gained only a so-so reputation (I assure you, it&#039;s not as bad as it sounds).<br />
But first, let me gush on the things I love about this show.<br />
<br />
--The Characters--<br />
<br />
They are vibrant, have strong personalities and leave a lasting impression with each having a compelling character arc. The main trio have a very heartwarming familyesque dynamic (the fact that they&#039;re separated a lot of time makes it even more powerful in a way) and specifically Masaru&#039;s growth throughout the series ties in very nicely to the progression of the story and the details he keeps uncovering about himself as well as the antagonists of this series.. This also includes a great deal of its secondary characters, which the series is not afraid to kill off and kills off meaningfully, making sure that their deaths are cathartic and tie in to the themes of the series. This also includes some of its villains.<br />
<br />
--The Story---<br />
<br />
I like how even some of the smallest details from early episodes are reincorporated much later in the series as an important plot point (like the food Elanore made or the blood she let Masaru drink, how Masaru&#039;s dad died, etc&#039; etc&#039;), and how all the threads come together in the end. I like the fast but steady pace with new revelations happening every so often and tension staying present for its entire run. Not to mention that it has one of the most satisfying and powerful conclusions I&#039;ve seen in a while.<br />
<br />
--The Themes-- (spoilers)<br />
<br />
The circus, puppet and clown motif of this series fit very nicely in to the themes of the story - a story of human emotions, free will and happiness and what they actually mean. The series main antagonist couldn&#039;t accept that the love of his life didn&#039;t return his feelings. Even his goons (the Automata) were originally created to make that person happy. When that didn&#039;t work, he became desperate and manipulated his love&#039;s emotions by force. Forcing her to love him back (quite literally) like a puppet. This also ties in to the disease that is spread in the series which has people feeling pain when they can&#039;t make others around them laugh (the same pain the antagonist felt),  which is the job of a entertainers like the ones in the circus <br />
<br />
In contrast Eleonore&#039;s character has been forced and trained to have no emotions whatsoever. To never smile, only to have a blank stare. Of course all of  that changes once she meets and creates a bond with Narumi and Masaru.<br />
<br />
The point is that happiness should not be acquired through any means,  human emotions aren&#039;t something to be puppeteer-ed. It should come naturally from inter personal relationships as well as positive or negative experiences that will shape them. Which is demonstrated in the series through the strengthening bonds between its main characters.<br />
<br />
Those are just the main examples of how this idea is explored. Throughout the series we get an exploration of this theme through various characters with vastly different perspectives on these subjects, depending on their past (and present) experiences, as well as a resolution to it by the end of the series.<br />
<br />
<br />
--The Visuals--<br />
<br />
The series has an old-school and semi-GAR looking art-style which I love, but at the same time it looks very polished, clean and with thin outlines so it won&#039;t turn off people who are accustomed to the modern look. The animation is somewhat limited but that&#039;s exactly the style it&#039;s going for. This show prioritizes good framing instead of movement and it does an excellent job of that. The action, while light on strategy, is very well choreographed and each character fights differently. It puts great emphasis on the decisive blows and body/puppet parts blowing apart in each battle with cool visual effects, making them feel very satisfying to watch. It&#039;s directed by the same guy who directed Trigun, Hajime no Ippo and the new Ushio to Tora adaptation, and enhancing limited animation as well as great fighting choreography seems to be his expertise. Plus, the amount of action this series has gives Dragon Ball Z a run for its money. The volume of violence and scary imagery is also quite high for a shonen.<br />
<br />
It may look a little stiff in places and it may appear to use its style as an excuse for taking animation shortcuts on occasion. In addition there&#039;s some light use of CGI on some of the puppets, but overall the visuals are pretty awesome.<br />
P. S. - I also wanna point out that the female characters are hawwwt beyond description.<br />
<br />
--The Audio-- <br />
<br />
Emotionally powerful voice acting (albeit a little cheesy), great intense rock music mixed with circus themed sounds and bombastic sound effects really compliment this series perfectly and enhances every set piece and emotional beat. The OPs and EDs are solid and range from rock to tencno pop, and I specifically love the 2nd op for its opening and closing guitar bits that really make you pumped to watch the episode and the 1st op for sounding very circus-like and is later used as the final ED.<br />
<br />
<br />
From here on I&#039;ll try to go over the story structure pointing out its highs and lows as an adaptation without going in to any specifics. So if you consider that a spoiler then just skip to the last three paragraphs.<br />
<br />
---------------------------<br />
<br />
The series has a very strong start. Its first 4 episodes... hell I&#039;d even say its first seven episodes - are great. They introduce the characters perfectly, all of which work off each other very well. The story progresses at a blazing fast pace at this point but everything is coherent and easy to follow..<br />
<br />
Episodes 8 through 14 is where the true weaknesses start to show and honestly I&#039;d say this is where the series is at its weakest.<br />
Trying not to go in to specifics here, but the main characters get separated at this point and the series struggles to tell this story by juggling between two different perspectives which results in it neglecting both. To the point it becomes very obvious that the anime is skipping over material. <br />
Characters are quickly introduced and quickly killed off after they served their purpose. <br />
It&#039;s&#039; clear that there are several story beats missing as well, when a character is in one location in one episode, and then in a faraway location in the next episode with some voice over to fill in the gaps. It also tends to just jump ahead and then retroactively show a brief flashback that hastily shows us what we&#039;ve missed (which happens at least twice). Not to mention huge doses of exposition that are a little too much to process in such a short amount of time.<br />
With that said, this section is still really cool, but it could&#039;ve been so much better (and it probably is, in the manga).<br />
<br />
Episode 15 feels like more of a fresh start with my only gripe being that it didn&#039;t seem to segway in to it all that well.<br />
<br />
Episodes 16 through 19 is basically a huge info dump through flashbacks. It&#039;s a little convoluted and mildly confusing in places but is overall far more satisfying and well handled than some of the previous episodes and by the end of it we get a clear picture with an unraveling of its mystery (not to mention that it&#039;s pretty effective emotionally).<br />
<br />
Episodes 20 through 29 is a very good mix of action and good storytelling with more revelations and further development of characters that were properly introduced before and didn&#039;t simply appear out of thin air. These episodes feel like the climax of the series but is actually only setting up the real climax which is episodes 30 through 36. All of which were handled well in terms of pacing and coherency. The entirety of the latter two thirds o the series are actually even more reasonably paced than the very strong first 7 episodes, which culminates in to a solid and powerful finale. <br />
<br />
This part still has some minor hiccups here and there, which may or may not be exclusive to the adaptation. Like a lack of foreshadowing for certain things (*Cough* spaceship *cough*) or Narumi&#039;s character arc being a little hard to track for a long period of time and some deaths and new revelations that happen very close to one another. <br />
But this was definitely the high point of the series as it should be.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
So overall the adaptation seems to have rushed through the first third in favor of the latter two thirds. I can imagine that watching this weekly while it was airing must&#039;ve been more frustrating and harder to follow than watching it at your own pace like I did.<br />
<br />
Despite some issues here and there, in my humble opinion Karakuri Circus is one of the best shonen series to come out this decade (alongside Hunter x Hunter and possibly Dr. Stone). It has interesting things to say, the characters are memorable, it&#039;s complete (sort of), it&#039;s dark but also uplifting, and most importantly - it&#039;s very entertaining. <br />
<br />
It&#039;ll probably become more of a cult classic that will gain a following over the years, but sadly won&#039;t break in to the mainstream.<br />

    That moment when it all just stops making any God damn sense.<br />
<br />
I really liked the first episode. Even recommended to my friends. But oh boi that it took me for one heck of a ride <br />
<br />
People might enjoy it but I hate it. Its like a long bad roller-coaster ride  which you think you&#039;ll enjoy initially but as it goes on, you keep feeling sicker and sicker and by the end of the ride, you start throwing up. And it&#039;s also so unpredictable but in such a way that you start questioning yourself that why did you start watching this. There&#039;s is just too

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308477">
        much happening in such a short time that it becomes hard to connect the current episode to the previous one. <br />
<br />
All in all, I&#039;d stay away from its if I were you. Binge it after it&#039;s done broadcasting as that way it might make more sense. That&#039;s if you are desperate enough as there are many other better shows you can watch. I had high hopes for this one and liked the old school animation but it just didn&#039;t make the cut. <br />

    This story is about tragedy, friendship overcoming tragedy through love and tragedy, and revenge. Oh! Specially to remind you what happens when you cock-block someone. The character development is amazing and very strong and so is the plot. It has a bunch of mysteries that all get revealed, and through the story there are two full circles that are nicely done through characterization. What do I mean by that? Well by the end of the series you will get why. <br />

This is a story heavily involving puppets and circuses and alchemy. What Puppets, revenge, circuses, alchemy and forms of immortality or reincarnation do not interest

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311598">
        you? Then, this is not for you. <br />
<br />
The music is great and so is the art and the fights are very good. If you have seen Ushio to Tora, then you would most likely like this one too, since well...its the same author. By the same logic, after you see this series and will like to watch something somewhat similar but not really similar then watch Ushio to Tora ( the newer adaptation). Both of them are after very old mangas which both happen to have very good adaptations. <br />
<br />
The only reason I do not give it a 10 is because arc 2, is super duper rushed, so very rushed a lot of people drop it before finishing this series. I love stories where plot is heavily important, characters are connected not just because but because of strong writing. This series embodies that, but get ready because there are so many mysteries, you won&#039;t believe there is still more. If you still cannot decide see the first opening of the anime.

    &quot;All the world&#039;s a stage, and all the men and women merely players; They have their exits and their entrances.&quot;<br />
<br />
If I have anything to say about acclaimed mangaka Kazuhiro Fujita&#039;s works of the late 90s (that includes Ushio to Tora) back in the day, this quote from William Shakespeare would be it as the symbolism to his entrée for the Shounen fans for a bygone era. Similar to Ushio to Tora, while there is no denying that the former has been quite impactful after a recent anime adaptation back in 2015, the same cannot be said for the latter here, expanding 3-cours in his longest-ever

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311578">
        43-volume manga. Probably modern-day anime industry problems? We&#039;ll never know, except that even if Kazuhiro Fujita himself is plagued by such problems, this anime adaptation would have not been served justice to his rendition of storytelling. There&#039;s just simply not enough time and resources.<br />
<br />
With that said, Karakuri Circus is one hellish of a manga, created when Shounen traits were at its infancy, and the era of the 90s was a great time for just about any story that is worthy of not just quantity, but quality. However, as mentioned, not even other mediums like anime have THAT luxury to spend a lot of time and resources to adapt the entire manga, and so we&#039;re given the bite-sized stories and plots of the series, which for fans of the mangaka, would be extremely disappointed with. And as an anime-only, even though the flaws are there from the start (birth) and the eventual trickling right down towards the downfall spiral (death) are existent, I find it baffling at how it is done, but at the same time, forgive the shortcomings I have for this show.<br />
<br />
&quot;And one man (Kazuhiro Fujita) in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages.&quot;<br />
<br />
Act 1: Masaru (in his Infant-cy) - &quot;At first, the infant, hugging and loving in the nurse&#039;s arms.&quot;<br />
The life of Masaru Saiga, an ordinary-looking regular young boy. Word is it that he is the (illegitimate) son of the Saiga Corporation, with a bounty of an incredible sum of money on his head. To that extent, he doesn&#039;t know but treads his life as per normal. He encounters a buff-looking guy by the name of Narumi Kato, wedged in a circus costume. The thing is, he suffers from the ZONAPHA syndrome, and all we really know at this point is that he needs to make people laugh in order to stay alive. And he&#039;s not a very comedic person to boot. And due to puppets knowing this information to hunt Masaru down, Narumi instantly becomes his bodyguard, not knowing of the cold and hard truths of his existence. And this is the first time we got to see Shirogane, and her controlling marionette Arlequin, whom eventually Narumi joins in this conquest to stop the syndrome and get his share of answers as well.<br />
<br />
Problem is, being the illegitimate son also means that other family members are also tied to this absurdity of a conflict. And that happens with Zenji, Masaru&#039;s uncle , whom under the influence of several clans, attempts to salvage the inheritance from Masaru. What&#039;s worse, is that this entire &quot;bounty hunter&quot; situation is a stage set up by his deceased father (Sadayoshi) in order to destroy the clan that the family has engaged with to build puppets. And one of those leaders is Ashihana Eiryo, commanding a team to kill Masaru, but due to Masaru&#039;s never-die spirit, eventually he is hired by Masaru, and follows the trio on their journey of escape. Unfortunately, something had to come to an end, and Narumi is nowhere to be seen, only a part of his body emerged intact with Masaru.<br />
<br />
Act 2: Circus * Departure (for the Schoolboy) - &quot;Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel and shining morning face, creeping like snail unwillingly to school.&quot;<br />
The situation befalls under a timeskip, with Masaru and Shirogane eventually settling down life with a bunch of circus people, namely the Nakamichi Circus, in debt of its talents and resources. With the duo, the circus gets moving again, adding another member (Vilma Throne), whom just like the situation with Ashihana, and Shirogane realizing that her lifestory is also one that trickles down to what Narumi is facing currently, and yeap, it is the ZONAPHA syndrome.<br />
<br />
On the other side of the coin, Narumi is recuperating with his lost left arm, which are given life again by his saviour, Shirogane&#039;s old teacher Guy Christophe Resh. In a facility where the syndrome was spread like wildfire to children whom now suffers immensely at their age, and like Narumi, attempts to give their whole life to fighting this syndrome. Narumi, now resurrected as a Shirogane-O and given life by this thing called Aqua Vitae, is called upon and to follow several people on their conquest to stop this syndrome, namely Lucille Berneuil, along with Guy and Mingxia (daughter of Narumi&#039;s martial arts teacher) to go to China and re-discover this whole &quot;reincarnation&quot; story. <br />
<br />
Continuing on, take note of the whole &quot;reincarnation&quot; thing as this plays out as the series goes, as this is can be very confusing, definitely a major plot device for what&#039;s about to happen.<br />
<br />
Act 3: Karakuri - brothers Bai Jin and Yin (as Lover-s) - &quot;And then the lover, sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad made to his mistress&#039; eyebrow.&quot;<br />
Before I get to this doozy, I must mention that as much as this part of the story is rushed and butchered for the anime adaptation, it is a very VITAL piece of information that connects and intertwines all of the characters&#039; fates together. Ready? Let&#039;s go.<br />
<br />
The story of brothers Bai Jin and Yin, descendants of Narumi&#039;s teacher, studying alchemy in the city of Prague. There is only ONE figure that is a catalyst for everything: A silver-haired girl called Francine, whom herself is a poor street seller, and trying to make amends to keep herself alive. What is uncanny is that Bai Yin is the reincarnation of Narumi and Francine being one with Shirogane, in terms of appearances (even I did not get that in my first try). Remember what I said about the mysterious Aqua Vitae? Yes, both brothers created the Soft Stone that houses the Aqua Vitae, but however for varying reasons.<br />
<br />
Due to Yin&#039;s push to marry Francine and his desire to help people like her, the other brother (Jin) got swined under the rug and did the same as Yin, only to reincarnate the looks of Francine by making an automaton like her, naming her &quot;Lady Francine&quot; and making other automaton in an effort to make her laugh. Unfortunately the Aqua Vitae that Jin composed isn&#039;t of the same quality as Yin&#039;s, and released the deadly ZONAPHA syndrome out in the wild, affecting everyone in the city. And it so happens that Lucille is one of those people who contracted the syndrome, and when Yin sacrificed the Soft Stone containing Aqua Vitae that should have been used on Francine before the villagers burned her to death before, Lucille got a hold of Yin&#039;s ideology, that automatons have existed, and are still rampaging around, spreading the syndrome aggressively, and they must be stopped.<br />
<br />
Act 4: Karakuri: Final Act - the battle (of Soldiers) between the Shirogane-O and the Automaton - &quot;Then a soldier, full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard, jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel. Seeking the bubble reputation even in the cannon&#039;s mouth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now that the information about the Shirogane-Os and the Automaton (Good vs. Evil) is known to us, there&#039;s only one problem: the Midnight Circus, and the master automatons known as the Les Quatre Pionniers, the 4 pioneers of the effect of Bai Jin, carrying his legacy. Fortunately, the team of Shirogane-Os led by Commander Faceless are there to help Narumi, Mingxia and the created ones (Fatima, Rockenfield, Schwarzes Tor, Timbavati, Malina) into an all-out battle with the master automatons.<br />
<br />
Simple enough right? You haven&#039;t seen the worst of it yet.<br />
<br />
Act 5: Circus: Final Act - the (Justice) of the Saiga family saga: &quot;Reincarnation&quot; and &quot;Download&quot; - &quot;And then the justice, in fair round belly with good capon lined, with eyes severe and beard of formal cut, dull of wise saws and modern instances. And so he plays his part.&quot;<br />
To everyone who cannot piece this information well, I don&#039;t blame you, because the duo I mentioned as highlight points is what piles up questions and answers being hard to come by, not until the last moments where the action gets intense.<br />
<br />
OK? So get this:<br />
Masaru Saiga, isn&#039;t his father Sadayoshi &quot;reincarnated&quot;, believed not only as an illegitimate son, but however in a string of mis-figures streaming down from the master puppeter, Shoji Saiga, his grandfather. Apparently, under the influence of Bai Yin, with Shirogane&#039;s marionette in hand, Shoji encountered Angelina (another Shirogane lookalike), got married with her, had a child called Eleonore (which is the modern day Shirogane to put it simply, they&#039;re the same person). However, the couple had already started making marionettes, and Dean Maistre is one of them.<br />
<br />
The storytelling problems ensue when the whole issue of when the entire family was attacked by automata for wanting the Soft Stone that was embedded in Eleonore. In doing so, the Francine that could not laugh, sacrificed her life for Eleonore. And that is the least of the problems. Because it is then and there that one of the people was Commander Faceless, ONLY this time in the &quot;reincarnation&quot; of BOTH Bai Jin AND Sadayoshi Saiga, as the original had passed away and Shoji having lost his bottom half in a freak accident. This should have been the deal-breaker that Masaru wasn&#039;t Sadayoshi all along, but being himself who was unconsciously &quot;Download&quot;-ed from Sadayoshi. And in order to keep his brain running the way it does, Masaru becomes the catalyst for Faceless to determine his undying love for Francine. So imagine with me when you finally put together the pieces of the puzzle. IT&#039;S THAT confusing.<br />
<br />
Act 6: Pantalone - &quot;The sixth age shifts into the lean and slippered pantaloon, with spectacles on nose and pouch on side. His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide for his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice. Turning again toward childish treble, pipes and whistles in his sound.&quot;<br />
With the full picture on everyone&#039;s toes, everyone goes on their own ways.<br />
<br />
With Masaru rejoining with the Nakamichi Circus crew, and Narumi back at the institute where he got his fast recovery, the chance now to save people is with a device (created by Fou the Jester) that can amplify the power of the Aqua Vitae and use it towards people, for them to recover from the syndrome, and also to stop the ZONAPHA bugs. The new Commander Faceless, now the leader of the automatons, signalled the end when the Les Quates Pionniers (reconstructed) came back to stop the entire opposing cast (Masaru, Narumi, Eleonore a.k.a Shirogane, Ashihana with George Laroche, a Shirogane-O, Mingxia, Nakamichi Circus with Lise the Beast Tamer (her arc was not presented in the anime). Everyone, AND I MEAN EVERYONE, is called upon to stop the schemes of Commander Faceless.<br />
<br />
Act 7: Old Age - The Curtain Falls - &quot;Last scene of all that ends this strange eventful history, is second childishness and mere oblivion; Sans teeth, sans taste, sans eyes, sans everything.&quot;<br />
With Faceless&#039;s dominion for a world of automaton, and Masaru, Narumi and Shirogane all wanting to end this farce, this endgame is probably the best reward that anime watchers can ever have after sticking around with the massive&quot;show-and-tell&quot; traits experienced over the past 30 episodes, and diving into the last 6 episodes with the redeeming factor multiplied as we approach the finals.<br />
<br />
New studio, Studio VOLN, took the reigns of adapting Kazuhiro Fujita&#039;s works (such as Ushio and Tora in 2015), and with this, it showcases the highs and lows of trying to put out a picturous showcase of close to 400 chapters in a span of 9 months. It started out strong with stunning CGI, but then when the action is loose it diverts into generic-looking sceneries to salvage for the fact that the action scenes (supposedly) take up a lot of effort by the staff artists to come up with. Probably the best parts where you can see this is in the last 2nd half of the last cour, where Act 7 really plays to great effect on the whole ideology that the circus itself is a motif, in true essence that &quot; to seek happiness is to find the true meaning behind it&quot;, and enlarge it into a great scale. But overall, it was a bell-curve of sorts.<br />
<br />
The music is kinda of a mixed bag of sorts. The 1st cour started out strong with BUMP OF CHICKEN and Lozareena, definitely giving it an impression that the 90s aesthetics was here to stay and remain the course of the series to come. However, the slow pace of the 2nd cour coupled with the OP/ED duo, was somewhat unlikeable and didn&#039;t quite have the same feel from before that is established from the 1st cour. The same duo will come back for alternating OP and ED (though same use of the song, just the 2nd verse and chorus) for the last cour, and this made all the difference after watching everything from the beginning to the end. Overall, also plenty fine, and nothing home to write about.<br />
<br />
And there you have it. A rushed adaptation for a series that could really have gone so much further, had it the right progression to pace out the events, and its chronological order of events played that would have made the less-appearing cast look more in place then the main counterparts of the show.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s sad that even the production team behind it:<br />
- Director Satoshi Nishimura, who had worked on the classic Trigun and Ushio to Tora anime adaptations,<br />
- Music director Yuuki Hayashi, simply great music,<br />
- Series Composer Toshiki Inoue, scriptwriter for Sword Gai (which is absolute trash),<br />
- Plus the mangaka himself (Kazuhiro Fujita) being another series composer (likely supervisor)<br />
Was stellar to say the least, but the combined efforts and the curse of 90s aesthetic storytelling just doesn&#039;t work in this day and age. I&#039;d even bet to say that the mangaka himself has also lost his touch, as did his resume of manga with Karakuri Circus the last of his works for the 90s, likely overburned by the thought of having this insanity of a series that was considered God-like.<br />
<br />
But it ain&#039;t anymore. Karakuri Circus is an experience that I would second guess to people wanting to watch this, but you can also read the manga (which isn&#039;t fully translated yet). But I&#039;d guess you can at least try. And so does the thought of William Shakespare: &quot;They have their exits (Kazuhiro Fujita) and their entrances (mediocrity).&quot;

    Story (8/10)<br />
The theme of the story is interesting and I haven&#039;t seen an anime that centers around puppets. Although, the story development could be improved because in most of the episodes that I&#039;ve seen so far, certain arcs are skipped through and multiple new characters are being introduced in almost every episode with little to no introductions. With that being said, the story is interesting and you&#039;ll get used to the fast paced development.<br />
<br />
Art (9/10)<br />
The art is beautiful, reminds me of art styles from older anime&#039;s. There&#039;s great detail in almost every scene and character, you could tell that the animators/artists worked hard into portraying

          <span style="display: none;" id="review305998">
        each character and making each and everyone of them different. <br />
<br />
Sound (8/10)<br />
The sound overall is fantastic. The OP and the ED compliments the anime and there is new OP&#039;s and ED&#039;s in every other episodes. <br />
<br />
Character (7/10)<br />
Each character has their own personality but character development is going too fast in certain episodes.  Introductions are fast and you can hardly get to know each character but I connected with some of the characters, especially Narumi. Narumi had the best character development out of everyone in the anime. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (9/10)<br />
I enjoyed watching this anime, its like a diamond in the rough. There&#039;s potential and I can tell that the anime is gonna get better in time.. hopefully.<br />
<br />
Overall (9/10)<br />
The anime is unique and you can hardly find anime&#039;s just like it. I heard the manga is more in depth especially with each story arc so I recommend anyone to check out the manga first before seeing the anime to prevent confusion with the fast pace.<br />

    Some stories just need time to develop. A lot of people say some shows go on for too long, but generally speaking, if a show goes on for years and years, it’s for a damn good reason. Take One Piece for instance. Could you imagine that ending in 50 episodes? Or Naruto, which, while it became a mess during its final stretch, did need the length it had to tell its story. Karakuri Circus is a 43 Volume Long Manga by Fujita Kazuhiro, an author that seems to be, while unrecognized compared to his peers, highly respected by the fanbase, and it probably needed that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review329150">
        length (I haven’t actually read it).<br />
<br />
So then, who, in their right mind, thought it was a good idea to adapt it in 36 EPISODES!?<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
As you might imagine with the opening bit of this Review, it’s the pacing that kills this Anime. It doesn’t start out too bad, however. The first three or so episodes are actually really well paced all things considered. Hell, the first three episodes in general are actually really great. They could be their own little OVA and nothing would really feel missing. They provide an interesting story with a decent conclusion and overall they’re just really good.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately after that the problems start. The plot moves on way too fast after that, with events that should probably be given a lot of attention feeling as if they were cut short. This even expands to the character focus, as the show has a bad tendency to introduce characters only to kill them off some episodes later, but in the end you don’t care about them once their time comes.<br />
<br />
This also makes the show a thematic mess. A lot of the ideas are actually really cool and I think with proper time they could be explored, but there’s too many for the time. The show is trying to explore stuff like mortality, free will, what it means to be alive, the difference between artificial beings and non-artificial ones… it’s a lot, yet due to the ultra fast pacing, almost none of them get enough focus. This also causes problems in terms of escalation, as stuff that should have a steady build up in terms of threats comes out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
Also, an issue that cannot be excused by the pacing are the flashbacks. Good freaking lord there’s more flashbacks in this show than Gundam SEED Destiny! And they’re long too! Sometimes they can go on for many episodes which makes you lose track of the ongoing plot. I mean I’m happy these events got focus, but they happen so regularly it’s annoying. Overall, this show is a bit of a mess.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
As said before, the show’s pacing prevents most of the characters from getting any particular focus. To be 100% fair, I don’t really dislike anyone on principle, but I didn’t care about anyone due to the lack of focus. Take for instance our lead: Masaru. He technically has a coming of age story here, but the plot is just so all over the place that you lose track of it. His co-leads Shirogane and Narumi are better about this, but only by so much really.<br />
<br />
The side cast suffers even more from this. Everyone will get like, a few minutes to themselves, sure, but given the stuff we learn about them it feels as if we’re just rushing through their stories, not helped that some of them disappear for many episodes before reappearing. The sole exception to this problem the whole cast faces is the main villain, Bai Jin. While he’s not exactly what I would call great, he’s interesting enough for me to say I actually cared about the stuff going on when he appeared. In the end, this cast is rather weak however.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
<br />
The show looks good. I wish I could say more but that’s about it really. Everything looks fine, I don’t think there was anything in particular that went off-model, the fight scenes are decent on average and overall it’s a nice looking show, but not much else to mention, really. I will say though: I like the tone of silver they use for certain character’s hair. It’s a minor thing, I know, but it’s still worth bringing up.<br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
<br />
Similarly the soundtrack was just kinda there for me. Again, all the tracks fit the scenes, but at the same time none of them popped up to me. The sole exception is the First Opening Theme/Third Ending Theme “Gekkou”, which was admittedly pretty cool.<br />
<br />
Voice Acting:<br />
<br />
Surprisingly enough the show has an All-Star Cast, even including some actors who barely do voice work anymore due to how expensive they are. The exception to this is Masaru’s Seiyuu, Ueda Chihiro, as this is her only role so far, and even then I thought she was pretty decent in it. On average everyone’s pretty good, with Hayashibara Megumi and Koyama Rikiya being standouts and the overall best being Furukawa Toshio as Bai Jin. It honestly surprises me she can still pull off such a voice in spite of being in his 70’.<br />
<br />
Besides them however, there’s also Yuuki Aoi, Fukuyama Jun, Park Romi, Sasaki Nozomu, Kanai Mika, Suyama Akio, Sakura Ayane, Sakurai Takahiro, Hanba Tomoe, Nakata Jouji, Sakenbogi Sayaka, Seki Tomokazu, Inoue Marina and Terasoma Masaki among many, many others.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
I can see Karakuri Circus being good had it been given more time, but sadly we can’t really focus on the what ifs here, can we? In the end this show is a bit of a mess. Doing short adaptations of long stories takes a lot of effort to pull off, and I don’t think this show really pulled it off in my opinion. I can’t really recommend it, as while it does have some cool tricks, it’s hard to say this performance was one that I could truly call worth it.<br />
<br />
Final Score: 5/10

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, because I needed to address a certain disturbing plot points and events and I can’t analyse them the without mentioning the story. So don’t read if you haven’t watched the series yet.<br />
<br />
This anime plotline can be considered an epitome of unhealthy and abusive relationship. The way it equates a constant abuse and violence to love is not only outrageous and wrongful, but even criminal. Of course I’m talking about ‘romance’ between Narumi and Eleonore. There are many examples of bad-written pairings in anime in general, but this one beats them all. It’s a classical case of abusive relationship when a girl

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313215">
        becomes dependent on her abuser and even develops a Stockholm syndrome. It was so freaking disgusting to watch this being presented as lovey-dovey story, made me sick.<br />
<br />
Firstly, Eleonore is a typical girl who can fall into this sort of abuse. She said herself that she was very lonely almost for a century. She had only constant fighting in her life. Narumi and Masaru were literally the first people who became her friends, at least that’s what she thought about Narumi. He treated her normally at first - again, classical sign of abuser. Every unhealthy relationship starts on a good note. Every abuser behaves genially and even kindly before they show their true colors. They don’t start mistreating their victim until later on. So, Eleonor didn’t have any kind of close romantic relationship before, she simply didn’t know how it goes and what was normal and not for it. And when Narumi started to yell at her constantly, repeat that he’d kill her, humiliate her, ignore her and overall treat her extremely rude, Eleonore had no life experience to distinguish if it was okay or not. She turned into an exemplary victim who runs after her abuser even when he shoved her off. The behaviour of such victims are usually very childlike, and that’s natural, because people who fall into such abuse are generally kind, infantile and naive. Just like Eleonore. For a lonely girl who didn’t know any human amity before, it was enough for Narumi to act a little friendly to her in the beginning - and she became easily attached to him. Then she was so afraid to lose that little warmth and kindness she tasted, that she was ready to endure any following insults and mistreatment from him. Also she made a typical mistake of a kind-hearted person - she judged Narumi by her own standards. So she was sure that if he hated her, that must be her fault and not because he is a revolting aggressive bastard. To put it simply, Eleonore couldn&#039;t discern that such treatment wasn&#039;t normal, and she should just tell Narumi to back off.<br />
<br />
For the most part of the series their relationship appeared as a pure hell for Eleonore. She went through incessant yelling, threats for her life, even beating, overall disdainful treatment, hate and ignore from Narumi. Notice the sharp contrast in her communication with her automaton followers, comrades from the circus troupe or Masaru after she spoke with Narumi. It was a classical illustration when a girl in abusive relationship with her jerk boyfriend meets her friends. They all were so kind to her, always were glad to see her and ready to help. Compare it to constantly angry and aggressive Narumi who could at most give her a short orders or tell her to shut up otherwise he’ll kill her while making furious faces. And after all of this she still continued to beg for his attention and repeat that she loves him. That was absolutely nauseating and disturbing, but also presented an example of sick relationship when victim has a Stockholm syndrome. She became attached to her abuser and protected his right to torment her psychologically. Yes, it’s definitely isn’t healthy state of mind. Eleonore needed help. But what she got instead of it? Idiotic cheering from all her supposed friends for this pairing.<br />
<br />
That was another big problem in representation of this ship. Anyone who has eyes could have noticed that Narumi treated her absolutely unfairly, brutally and plain dangerously for her life. But not only they ignored it like it was a normal thing, they encouraged this relationship. Up to the point when circus troupe shoved them both into one train carriage so they could ‘enjoy’ their time together. While they all saw that Narumi rudely and hatefully spoke to Eleonore literally a moments before. And this was considered as ‘love’ by people around. That’s the most disgusting thing in this anime. It’s one thing to show horrible treatment of a character, but it gets on another level of abhorrent advocacy of abuse if you make your characters to perceive it as something normal and to further encourage their relation instead of helping Eleonore to get out of it. The author clearly enjoyed abusing her. In fact in this repulsive depiction of a ‘couple’ dynamics I see his own fetishes and an idea about his perfect woman. She should be absolutely submissive, complaisant and kind despite any form of mental of physical violence her partner would cause her. She should express no discontent ever and blame all hate she receives on her own mistakes even if they are non-existent. She should never hold a grudge against her abusive partner and always rejoice from the tiniest bits of attention he gives her, even if it’s just a rude shout. Of course she also must be a beauty and know her place in the kitchen - remember that repugnant moment when Narumi once again aggressively complained that he didn’t like train food and Eleonore jumped up and suggested to make him something, but then realised there was no kitchen around. That was a minutes after he rabidly yelled at her for the hundredth time. Did the troupe kept them in a separate carriage and didn’t want to disturb them for this kind of romantic lovely moments they could share?<br />
<br />
In my eyes the author of this trash must be an old pervert who simply made Eleonore in an image of his ideal waifu. And his self-insert in the story must be Narumi of course. His attempt to normalise mental violence and abuse in ‘romantic’ relationship is absolutely pathetic. I guess he couldn’t find a woman in real life who he can yell at, berate and mistreat while she would obediently accept it all and blame only herself. So he took it all out into his manga. Naturally, any sane woman wouldn’t tolerate such crap, so he needed an archetype of a vulnerable and broken victim. Notice how not only Narumi, but all other people except for Masaru abused Eleonore when they thought she was guilty for spreading of Zonapha syndrome. And she resignedly accepted their hate and even physical violence against her without attempting to justify herself. Btw they didn’t even apologize later. She is a bullied and maltreated victim, ideally fit for abusive relationship where she can’t raise a voice against any aggression towards her. The author didn’t give her a single chance to stand for herself. Of course, he didn’t want her to defend herself against all unfair hate from Narumi or others because he takes pleasure in torturing her mentally and physically.<br />
<br />
Even more infuriating was an episode when even Eleonore’s closest and most caring person accepted that Narumi ‘loves’ her. I’m talking about Guy and his little duel with Narumi. Guy was the only exception from the cheering crowd which approved this trashy pairing. He actually stood up for Eleonore and at last said that constantly threaten to kill her is not normal. He even started a fight with Narumi and demanded that he stop his threats towards Eleonore. Narumi never agreed to cease it, but in one moment Guy just ‘realised’ that Narumi is apparently in love with Eleonore. Literally nothing indicated it. Narumi was spitefully yelling how he hates Eleonore as usual. And then Guy decided for some reason that it must be love and stopped fighting. What the heck was that? Does the author really think that telling how you’d kill a girl with a mad angry face is a sign of love? In what universe? His sick projections on how a man should be treating a woman he apparently loves is so nasty and distasteful, it even leads to such idiotic situations where Guy suddenly takes a hateful words for lovely confession apparently. He raised Eleonore since she was a child, cared for her deeply, but then agreed to leave her to a man directly telling him that he’d kill Eleonore? That’s a joke of a plot.<br />
<br />
Also notice how Eleonore’s opinion is not even taken into consideration. She is regarded as a trophy that Narumi or someone else could gain. Even another one of her close attendants, Pantalone, said absolutely hideous thing which I suppose expresses author’s own view on women and their place in relationship in general. He said that Eleonore ‘chose who will own her’. And that was Narumi of course, he is supposed to own her and that must be love from the author’s point of view. That’s the most unhealthy and disgusting take on romance I saw. He described slavery, not love, and the fact that Eleonore chose that slavery herself doesn’t equate to a voluntary choice, because she already became a repressed victim by that time and couldn’t think straight. That’s how author views it, if the woman is in relationship with someone, she belongs to him literally, he can do anything with his property and treat her however he likes. And she must obediently take it all and be grateful for any abuse, don’t forget.<br />
<br />
Another example of this disturbing way of thinking was the main conflict between the two brothers on a subject of who loved Eleonore first. It doesn’t matter who fell in love with her first. Only thing that matters is who she wanted to be with, because she is not your property that someone can claim. But the author obviously has his imaginary manly ‘code of honour’ according to which you shouldn’t ‘take’ the woman of your pal even if he is not dating her, but already fell for her. She is then considered his own and you shouldn’t interfere. What the woman herself wants of course doesn’t matter to the author and men who think like him. Later on this mindset showed again when Faceless asked Masaru why did he gave up on Eleonore and conceded to Narumi. And Masaru said that’s because Narumi loved her first. Again this BS, like from a cheap shounen romance or a primitive soup opera where girls rival over the main character and one of them concedes to another. Except here this trite soap opera situation was projected on guys and a girl. It doesn’t matter how many people loved Eleonore before if she has sympathy for one certain person. Not even talking about the fact that Narumi’s treatment of Eleonor is not love at all. Notice how they all only say that’s it’s unfair when you steal a girl if someone else loved her first, not because she didn’t want you. It’s unfair to steal from your buddy and good guys like Masaru shouldn’t do it, that’s the principle from which all this nonsense comes from. The woman doesn’t even have a say in this matter. Seriously, it’s known that Japan still has archaic view on relationships (that’s part of their demographic problem), but trying to romanticize a view on woman as a voiceless property is abominable no matter how you sugarcoat it.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Masaru, he actually was a very kind and understanding person. He could even make peace with Faceless himself. Just imagine if Narumi went to the station instead, he’d just rush into battle and never would be able to know the method to stop the virus. Masaru’s kindness saved them all in the end. And he genuinely adored Eleonore. I think they could very happily live together as a brother and sister, since his love was more brotherly in the end if you exclude all the interference that Faceless did to his mind. But his friendly and caring attitude towards Eleonore was conveniently pushed away so nothing would hinder her pairing with Narumi. Sadly, even Masaru wasn’t completely free of author’s rotten moral, remember the advise to smile in response to bullying in school instead of beating the abusers. Even though Masaru himself learned a couple of combat techniques already. This mindset of non-resistance to violence is extremely dangerous and is propagated only by abusers themselves. Every sane person should resist violence towards him or her and not joyfully accept it. It’s utterly twisted and corrupted logic, and if the author insert such behaviour patterns in the manga directed mostly at teenagers, he is just abuser himself and teaching his readers how to become an ideal obedient victims.<br />
<br />
In the end the author tried to justify Narumi’s behaviour by his loss of memory, but when he regained his memory in the train nothing has changed. He knew already that Eleonore wasn’t an automata, he had literally no reasons to be rude and aggressive to her, but instead of immediately asking for forgiveness for all the crap that he has done and said to her, he continued to treat her like an enemy. That’s obviously because the memory loss and his mistrust to Eleonore were merely pretext for abuse. Even when he was sure that she is his ally, he behaved like a jerk with her. Because the author only needed a formal excuse for all mistreatment and violence towards Eleonore, it never had a reasonable basis in the first place. So, the plot coherency never mattered, Narumi continued to abuse her with no cause for it except for his own nasty personality, and then in one second he suddenly realized that he ‘loves’ her, hence happy end. What a load of BS.<br />
<br />
All in all it’s not just bad written story with logical fallacies, it was intentionally propagating the idea that woman should know her place and never talk back and oppose a mental violence. The author also spread the idea that the biggest happiness for girl is to be in relationship and later marry a rude and aggressive gorilla-man. Narumi is like an embodiment of toxic masculinity. Notice, how Eleonor never had her own interests or goals in mind except for craving for Narumi. The author stripped her from any sign of an independent personality. And what’s the most detestable in this series, as I already mentioned, the author tried to present all this criminal maltreatment and abuse as something normal and romantic. It was so freaking disgusting and hideous. A woman doesn’t need some abusive boyfriend to be happy - in fact, she doesn’t need a man to become happy at all. She doesn’t need an ‘owner’ for herself, her world shouldn’t revolve around a man. She is not a property that you could argue over with your mate. No one can claim her only because he ‘loved her first’. Eleonore was a victim of mental violence and would have been thousands times happier if her friends beat up Narumi and helped her to get away from him. She was created as a dream girl for any sick abuser and domestic tyrant. And Narumi was behaving like one for the most part of the series. That’s your main characters who should be an example to follow? Deeply revolting.<br />
<br />
If author really wanted to make her happy he should have given her a reunion with her family. Her father could have been healed and then she would live with him, Guy and Masaru as a brothers. Instead we had that rushed idiotic ending and Masaru was demoted to a merely brainless fanatic of Narumi. Seriously, the author even gave him the same job in the end, I suppose to show how much Masaru admired that bastard. It’s like the author created a cult for Narumi and this crappy pairing. Even the only person who had much more developed relationship with Eleonore - Masaru - was turned to his worshipper. Absolutely trashy and nonsensical ending just like the whole story. I don’t believe it and I don’t believe for a second that Narumi has changed. He is the same abuser he had been for the whole series, so does the author. He actually destroyed his another work, Ushio and Tora, in a similar way. It started as an interesting adventure, but then he began to shove poorly written and irrelevant romance into it, which turned plot into garbage. No wonder a person with such views on women and relationship can’t write romance to save his life.<br />
<br />
I hope we won&#039;t get any more anime adaptations for manga from that idiot Fujita. This failure of a writer should be kicked out from manga industry.

    This adaption is pitiful its pathetic compared to the manga and to me after a fair 20 episodes it was straight up unwatchable and I&#039;ve watched quite a lot of amines.<br />
You might be wondering whats the problem?<br />
It&#039;s the plot, it doesn&#039;t seem to be following any of the manga at all and instead jumps from one chapter to 3 chapters after that. Secondly, its horrendous rushed, it chopped around 15 chapters and skewed it awkwardly into a single episode. If you haven&#039;t read the manga most likely you&#039;ll get lost after around 3 episodes.<br />
The only saving grace was the art, it clean and smooth. The

    This is my first review on this site, so forgive me if I typed something wrong (this review contains spoilers)<br />
<br />
In all those years I never expected them to adapt a manga that was unknown to me, as soon as I saw the ad, I fell, I was anxious, it was like a dream... But reality turned into a nightmare. I hate this anime sincerely, it manages to worsen the original material in every way, I have nothing against the manga of karakuri circus, I even think the manga a masterpiece, but this anime drives me mad.<br />
<br />
At first it seemed very harmless, but this anime cut

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311568">
        super important details soon after, the introduction of Narumi about his illness is forgotten and turned into a joke, the fear of Masaru being a person alone (including important point of the manga later), the fail worldbuilding of the karakuri mansion, and a ridiculous ending of the first arc, seriously that they traded a huge, sharp stone for lumps of wood?THIS DONT MAKE THE LESS SENSE, even more as Masaru survives a fire.<br />
<br />
The next arc is cruelly perforated and summed up in an idiotic way, nakamichi circus has a poor characterization in this anime, empty characters, conflicts removed, and all of them influence who masaru becomes in the future, Liese had a 1-volume bow itself, here it does not exist, it simply becomes a bad character. The start of the arc Automata can be even worse, narumi wake up at the hospital zonarpha even makes sense, but this leave questions unanswered, how the automatons have heard of him without him at least act before? Guy is a wasted character and poorly featured, he looks like a serious character than the fun character himself that was in the manga, making things rotten, all the characterization and importance of Lucille was cut because an incompetent screenwriter did not think that skipped an important arc (yes, France), Vilma is one of the few characters introduced in an acceptable way, even if they cut the development of it. As if they were not enough remove more characters in the nakamichi, they remove the George, who was the important piece in the Zonarpha Hospital, including he had confrontations that were cut. The part of China, was horrible, they adapted in the worst possible way, Liang became a nobody, they removed the introduction from her, they removed all the DRAMA she had, they removed the confrontation with the dog shirogane, and at the last moment, they do battle in the mountain look ridiculous and rushed, the midnight circus arc is a giant shit, they cut the VIKING, the German, the Russian... They gave shallow depths to the shiroganes, and all this leanes towards the worst development of Narumi, then several deaths were din&#039;t impact (and totally fillers moments), THE LUCILLE IS AN EXAMPLE OF WASTED CHARACTER, how do you want me to care about the character if they do not even build it right? Its end is ridiculous, this arc ends simply in THE HALF! THEY DIN&#039;T ADAPT THE END, they were in vol 21 and cut to events of vol 29, destroying all Lore of Karakuri.<br />
<br />
Now we focus again on Masaru and I still say that his journey is rushed here, until it went well in the revelations, but the scenes began to get more stupid, leaving the characters idiots, until they were adapting the Saiga bow well, only that the anime has self-destructed, involving Eleonore in the middle, okay it makes sense for her to look for him, but her arrival comes much later, there&#039;s no logic to it here, to just rush the plot, and in fact they did it. They removed scenes of Masaru discovering about his father&#039;s whereabouts FOR AN IMBECILE AND USELESS PERSECUTION of Guy, as if that were not the worst, the Masaru simply falls off the cliff, fainting and returning to memories of the past, THIS IS STUPID AND THAT DOES NOT MAKE SOME SENSE, is so stupid that it becomes offensive(is a filler scene, but one of the worst I&#039;ve seen), is useless, even because Masaru wakes up in the house anyway (error of continuity). The revelation of Faceless was still reasonable, although they cut important information, the problem is that after that point the anime part pro final arc, they skipped a whole arc that served as development of Masaru to go to the final bow, dude fuck this anime, it&#039;s ironic the fact that Masaru cares about peoples he&#039;s never seen in his life, while in the manga he cared because they helped him, and now we&#039;re off to the final arc.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the anime want to characterize Liese, this is so bad because the anime has not even built her story before, apart from the mistakes of continuity between Masaru change clothes, Masaru only uses that green coat on the arch of Kuroga Village ( but haha ​​they cut the arc again), the anime still tries to sell a redemption of the automata, HOW CAN I HAVE A REDEMPTION OF CHARACTERS THAT HAVE ONLY HAD 1/5 SCREEN TIME? This is useless, you just do not care about the character or anything. After this introduction the anime again tries to pregrar development in a character that we never had (Liang, George and Guy), the worst that have a nice battles, but an anime not only lives struggles to sustain itself, George had a horrible characterization in the anime. Later we see the battle in the castle of Faceless, where Liese appears to be a huge joke of the anime forcing itself to be interesting, the confrontation of Masaru and Faceless has no impact whatsoever, it is totally harsh, its psychological battle too, some infodump is up added here, but it only reminds me of how wasted the Aqua Vitae concept in the anime, Masaru already knows how to control puppets, and he took MONTHS(manga) in the kuroga village... Nothing here makes sense, with the unfolding of the plot they insert a character who tells how he met Narumi, but here&#039;s the problem, showing Narumi flashbacks in a certain arc, and you know what that means? ANIME HAS ADAPTED EVENTS THAT NEVER HAPPENED, totally out of order leaving a huge hole in the story, the staff writers do not care about the story.<br />
<br />
Narumi and Shirogane&#039;s relationship is bad, the anime cuts off moments they both talked at Nakamichi Circus, they put a SUPER IMPORTANT character on the plot and turn it into a nobody, Guy&#039;s death is really beautiful, if the anime shows the kind of person that he really is, I would love to see this, Guy was a sarcastic man, and in the anime he does not pass any of that. Vilma&#039;s death too, she&#039;s a character wasted in the plot, I no longer care about her, and her death did not take anything away from me. The fight of Nakamichi family automatons was fortunately very well conducted, I felt immersed to a character for the first time, after Colombine had the worst destiny in this anime, its relation with Masaru is totally obfuscated and mounted only here. The last battle with Narumi and Masaru is really pleasant to see, it was the only episode of the anime that I was happy, although hurried, the outcome of Narumi and Eleonore was also cool, but things get worse going forward, the last battle is terribly punctured and summarized in a few words, which harms all the time, because of the rushed rhythm, the villain has a poor character development, the final scenes are the Masaru telling Eleonore to sing, SERIOUS THAT HER DON&#039;T QUESTION BECAUSE HAVE TO SING ? This is stupid enough to make me mad, Jin&#039;s ending was cool, but what good is it to do something beautiful if your script sucks? One does not survive just from epic ost.<br />
<br />
the end of my review, the living proof that this anime does not care about any characters presented is the ending, the end of the manga shows the outcome of all the characters in the series, showing its consequences and what happened, NOW IN THAT PIECE OF SHIT, THEY SO ANIMATED THE NARUMI, ELEONORE AND MASARU ENDING! Forget the other characters that existed, Liang, Liese, nakamichi brothers... Everything is gone, I hate this anime from the bottom of my heart, this anime is useless, it did not deserve to exist at all. Maybe a little bit, it was the anime that boosted the new manga scans, I&#039;m grateful they continued to translate the manga, it&#039;s really good to read the full story. If you want to see a shounen like Fullmetal Alchemist or something that shows you the true entertainment, just read the manga from Karakuri Circus, I strongly recommend, do not watch this anime, it is quite painful to see a good manga being destroyed in a miserable way, I still expect a remake with +70 episodes in other future, this anime sins at everything that an anime shounen needs, is a story full of script holes and very few characters, this anime is an INSULT to the manga and the fans themselves.<br />
<br />
Just read Karakuri Circus, dont watch.<br />

    ✪ Genre: action (gunfights, martial arts, swordplay), drama, mystery, proxy battles, shounen, superpower (human enhancement), with elements of romance (love polygon, unrequited love)<br />
<br />
<br />
✔Positive Aspects✔<br />
<br />
◧ Character development: by far the most intriguing, and, eventually,  satisfying aspect of the series. Even though the series started balls-deep in action, which persists up until the 14th episode, it started, gradually, building the protagonists and antagonists up (even some deuteragonists were included). <br />
<br />
The series meticulously started filling in their personal histories (some of which were dating 2 centuries back), their current motivations, the intentions behind their actions (at both the situational and the broader level). and their thought processes.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337895">
        Furthermore, the emergence of tensions among the protagonists, and among the antagonists, was commonplace in the series, frequently leading to strained relationships among the former, while causing some of the later to switch sides. In general, most of the characters, protagonists and antagonists alike, were developing up until the final episode because situationally unique constellations of circumstances were forcing them to do so.<br />
<br />
◧ Concept: a conceptually unique series, revolving around a centuries-long feud between automata (self-governing puppets) and shirogane (humans; either mechanically enhanced or trained puppeteers) that was the indirect result of an instance of unrequited love. <br />
<br />
◧ Soundtrack: throughout the series, various pieces of music (classical, new age, Japanese folk music, J-pop) were used that were neither overly titillating nor disablingly uninteresting. I enjoyed them for the most part, though they could have been more captivating.<br />
<br />
◧ Animation: incredibly satisfying, based on highly saturated/highly vibrant colors. The characters&#039; designs were distinctly clear from one another, the designs of puppets and automata were very elaborate and individualized, while the man-made structures and the landscapes were not too shabby either.<br />
<br />
◧ Plot: structurally, the series was very alluring due to its very volatile, unpredictable plotline that was usually flirting with 2-3 subplots at any given time. It&#039;s a very rare spectacle, in my view, that a shounen series gets to achieve this level of mysteriousness and maintain it for so long. Specifically, it took the series 20 episodes to reveal to the audience the actual antagonist, while his/her own motivations, intentions, and thought processes took a little longer to be depicted adequately.<br />
<br />
<br />
✘Negative Aspects✘<br />
<br />
◧ Plot: enjoyment-wise, the series&#039;s unfolding felt formulaic even though it was unusually sophisticated for an action shounen. It tended to rely more on intricate, drawn-out dramatic sequences, which were usually based on flashbacks from different perspectives, than on the characters&#039; violent, but necessary, struggles in order for them to achieve their respective goals.<br />
<br />
◧ Action scenes: they tended to escalate and finish up quickly, instead of relying more on the use of slow-motion sequences, which are very well-established in, and absolutely expected of, the shounen genre. Gigantic disappointment.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: The series was technically well-done, but failed to balance out its dramatic parts with its action sequences in terms of quality and depth, leading to well-developed characters who were otherwise conducting warfare in a very unsatisfying fashion.<br />

    This was a 36 episode anime that really shouldn&#039;t have been that long. It followed the adventures of Masaru Saiga, a billionaire heir who inherits his father&#039;s wealth after his death. With the help of lover of kids and certified Jesus Christ, Narumi and the mysterious and beautiful doll like Shirogane, he tried to uncover his dead father&#039;s weird secrets and evade the weird puppet creatures coming after him. It had some pretty good points and a lot of bad, but let&#039;s look at the good first.<br />
<br />
I liked some of the characters in Karakuri circus. The protagonists were well established and developed. They had back

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324593">
        stories I could sympathize with and I was somewhat invested in their growth. The animation was okay, not spectacular, but okay. I liked that they did a bump of chicken song, so that was exciting.<br />
<br />
And now, the bad. THE PLOT! WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IN GOD&#039;S RIDICULOUSLY POLLUTED EARTH WAS GOING ON??? It was so convoluted, it felt like the equivalent of your earphones getting entangled in your pocket. While I could follow what was happening from a literal standpoint, nothing made sense to me. Some story choice just seemed beyond ridiculous and the resolution just seemed off. I liked that they had a philosophy (what it is to be human and what makes a human being), but they didn&#039;t present it in a way that was remotely intriguing to me.<br />
<br />
I also really had little patience for the villains. In a battle anime where there are supposedly epic fights, we get excited for the fight between good and evil mostly because we know both their stories. Ichigo vs Ulquiorra was a classic fight not simply because it had good animation, it was a good fight because we &#039;knew&#039; both characters, who they were and what they represented. In Karakuri circus, strong enemies just popped out of nowhere and started spouting philosophy which made no sense to me.<br />
<br />
I also didn&#039;t care for the romance element. I love a good romance story, but this one sucked. I wasn&#039;t even rooting for any of them. Same with some character deaths. Some were pretty unnecessary and added nothing to the story (tbf some did). It ended as well as such an anime could and I guess you could say the antagonist had a realistic reason for being who he was (even tho it was dumb). If you have some weird project to work on, this is the perfect anime to play in the background.<br />
