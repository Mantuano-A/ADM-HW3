    So I just finished this show today, and I am going to give you guys (and girls) a rating for each aspect of the show, and then I will give an overall review at the bottom.<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
The story was quite enticing, and it always left me wondering what would happen next, and it always stayed true to the main character&#039;s goal, Raishin, fighting along side his partner, Yaya. There were really no filler episodes, as each episode had some sort of meaning or foreshadowing that led into future episodes. There was also a lot of action, and the fighting scenes were very well done and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review142303">
        portrayed Raishin&#039;s abilities very well.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
Not much to say here, I just loved the art in the show. It looked very new and refined, the colors were very good, but the only issue I would have is that the &quot;3D&quot; look of the dragon, Sigmund, got a little funky sometimes, but it wasn&#039;t a huge issue. Very good, better than expected and looked very new.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
The sounds were amazing in this show. It had it&#039;s own effect for each puppet/character, and it gave the show and the characters a really unique feel. Sometimes there would be parts in fights where there was minimal sound with a lot going on, but it was made up for with lots of other fighting sounds in other fighting scenes, along with regular sounds in just normal scenes.<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
Mainly all of the characters were very well developed, and each character had their own unique sense to display who they really were. We got a lot of backstory on all of the main characters like Charl, Frey, Henri, partly Yaya, and a good amount of Raishin. My only complaint would be that I wish there was more backstory on Raishin, because even though his background DOES affect the plot quite a bit, I wish we got to see more about it other than this one specific scene that happens a few times over. Not a major thing though, as it still made his character very well developed. I won&#039;t go into too much detail about each character as I don&#039;t want to risk spoiling or ruining the experience for anyone. However, I CAN say that it is a someone romance/harem kind of aspect a good amount of the times that aren&#039;t during fights. It doesn&#039;t ruin the show for me, honestly, because it is made up with the main character not wanting to be a part of a harem, and also with all the fighting scenes and the main characters insane brains to get himself out of any situation.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
I really enjoyed watching every episode. There were no fillers, so you can watch each episode with reassurance that at least SOMETHING that happens will eventually be brought up in the next episode. I really loved all the characters, especially Yaya, and they just made the show that much funnier and more action packed.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
Overall, this show was a very fun show to watch. Every episode had some meaning to the plot, it always had lots of funny moments, but it knew how to transition to action and more serious scenes quite well. The show really stood out to me, as it was quite different from other shows I&#039;ve seen, and it really was a blast to watch. I loved watching each character interact with each other, some jealous, some more Tsundere, along with all the plot and development. In the end, it all came together for an amazing show that I REALLY hope will turn into a season 2. Fantastic show, I would definitely recommend watching it if you are into: A powerful main character (not OP), a romance/harem (not what the story is mainly about, but still present quite often), a whole bunch of unique characters, and comedy that happens all over the place. <br />
<br />

    I&#039;m a benevolent and tolerant guy, but there are three things I simply can&#039;t stand...<br />
People who order me around<br />
People who oppose me, and...<br />
A complicated plot that is in need of more explanation!  <br />
<br />
Story: 5<br />
The main character, Raishin, is on a quest to revenge his family and kill the person who wiped out his clan.  We join him as he enters a school of some sort and his adventures as he helps out fellow students in trouble. <br />
<br />
The problem with the story is that they left out small details that either would have helped explained certain plot holes (Such as why Yaya had to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review127233">
        turn off her invisibility) or complicated arcs such as the Loki and Frey arc.  Both Cher&#039;s arc and the Loki and Frey arc both involved types of politics and relationships that weren&#039;t fully explained and left me clueless on why Raishin was helping.  The pacing for the series was also fast, the time frame of what was a couple of days to what was a couple of minutes are never shown right, and when combined with the lack of knowledge led this story into a train wreck.  <br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
The art was very good.  The scenery looked nice along with character designs.  I loved how the characters would look when they faced left or right.  The use of CG for this series allowed for smooth animation on almost everything, except for certain action scenes (This is the opposite of what Ars Nova did with CG)<br />
<br />
Action scenes weren&#039;t bad, but there were times in where character movement and animation did not look as well as other parts of fight scenes.  A great example would be the fight with Loki, as certain scenes had Yaya and Cheribum looking epic, but other scenes were very confusing.  If they slowed down the fight scene and didn&#039;t use as many different angles when showing the fight scene, this problem would be solved.  <br />
<br />
Sound: 10+<br />
Anicca, the OP is a great set up for the series.  The song has a very soft start and leads to a metal guitar riff.  What more could help set up the plot where puppeteers use puppets to fight each other, since most puppets are machine like.  The ED is by far the best ED to come from the fall season, Maware! Setsugetsuka.  It may be because I have a soft spot for traditional Asian themed songs, but this song is cheerful with a very catchy beat.  The ED alone awarded this series a 10 in sound.  <br />
<br />
Background music was there to fit the mood, no complaints.  <br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
A place where this anime shines is in the characters.  All the characters looked amazing as well as had interesting personalities.  One of the few things I did get from the story was enough history for each character to have them be memorable.  Some of the best characters include; Yaya, the comedic yandere, Loki, the rival who hates more than three things, Frey, the girl with a small personality but a set of big brea... I&#039;ll stop.  These characters were very humorous and enjoyable to watch.  <br />
<br />
What about character development?  There is none that I noticed in the series, maybe small amounts when it comes to Frey and Loki, but nothing involving the main characters.  Is this a problem?  I will answer with another question, why change characters that were excellent to begin with?  Raishin and Yaya are blessed to be amazing characters from the very start and did not need character development.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6<br />
Although the sound and characters were amazing, the story left me so clueless that I was partially bored during all the serious scenes and most of the action scenes.  <br />
<br />
Also, what was Raishin&#039;s power involving Yaya?  Were they all different buffs or allowed different abilities involving Yaya?  I wish they had explained that, as it would have led to less confusing during the fight scenes.  Being ignorant of ones ability that is used a lot doesn&#039;t make for great fight scenes.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7<br />
This anime had my head do what the ED&#039;s chorus says, maware (Spin).  With such great sound and art, even great characters, the story was too poorly put together to enjoy all the other things this series did right.  Hopeful for a great season two.  <br />
<br />

    You know what makes someone the best? Wearing a crown and calling themselves a ‘king’ doesn’t make someone the best. No. What makes someone the best is to prove themselves in front of the whole world through hard work, determination, skill, intellect, guts, and earn the respect from their peers. At rank #1235, Rashin Akabane is far from the best. In fact, he’s close to the bottom pit of the fall outs. But for him, there’s nothing more he’d like than obtain the title “Wiseman”. Such a pretentious title is equivalent to those of a king and is the ultimate goal of a puppeteer.<br />

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125253">
        Kizutsukanai (aka Unbreakable Machine Dolls) is an animated series based on the light novel of the same name written by Reiji Kaito. The series takes place in the early 20th century in an industrial-like world. Rather than producing cannons and gunpowder though, there exists an emergence of a power known as Machinart – a fusion of magic and technology applications. The series follows Rashin and his automaton Yaya as they go on a journey of both endurance and vengeance.<br />
<br />
Kinji Yoshimoto is the director where he previously had experience with fantasy theme series such as Quee;ns Blade and Dog Days. Here, he is in charge of a fantasy theme series that molds the themes of magic and science. Upon first impressions, it’s easy to tell this show would fall under the typical fantasy/battle shounen style with the tournaments to prove one’s worth; and you’re not wrong if you think so because the show does depicts itself that way. However, a primary motivation for Rashin to become Wiseman is more than simply be the best. He is also on a quest for vengeance because of his tragic childhood.<br />
<br />
Growing up as an orphan, Rashin can be best described as a brash and hotheaded young man. He joins Walpurgis Machinart Academy to not only make a name for himself but to also find the culprit behind his family’s murders. It ventures into the mystery zone on a variety of occasions as Rashin also plays the role of an anti-hero. His sidekick is the all adorable and automaton Yaya. Unlike most automaton, Yaya looks like a human in a variety of ways. This is likely because of Rashin’s past where his childhood has a strikingly resemblance to her.<br />
<br />
Yaya portrays the role of an automaton, a weapon of war but also surprisingly shows many human emotions. This is usually evidenced by her aggressive behavior towards Rashin that borders on obsessiveness. For Yaya, Rashin is her raison d&#039;etre for existence. Throughout the series, it’s shown that her feelings for Rashin is genuine. Whenever his life is put into danger, Yaya would rush into the front lines of danger disregarding her own safety. Of course, this doesn’t always end well because the threats that their opponents pose. And as a normal human, Rashin has to work his way up. Unlike some of the other characters in the series such as Loki, he must prove to others that even a failure can surpass a natural genius. This puts himself on a frustration scale as we witness his struggles. On many occasions, he questions himself if he is worthy of being Yaya’s puppeteer or even a student at the academy. He hopes to not repeat his mistakes and become a master worthy of his partner. And because Rashin is not the typical Gary Stu character with plot armor, he isn’t invincible nor a superman.<br />
<br />
Despite the duo’s seemingly good relationship, there’s a variety of problems between them. Most of this is presented in a comical form as Yaya takes the role of an overly obsessive character. While not technically a yandere, she is infused with jealousy whenever a girl even comes into contact with Rashin. Regardless of age or appearance, Yaya simply cannot stand Rashin ever becoming acquainted with another member of the opposite sex. A seemingly flaw of this series shows that Yaya lacks a real personality in this way because of her one sided admiration and love for Rashin. The latter treats her affections with disgust and reluctantly tolerates her advances on rare occasions.<br />
<br />
The themes of magic and technology is a prominent aspect that is explored. The mechanics behind Machinart is explored on occasions although some parts are left in unexplored territories. Instead of telling though, the series presents them with other puppeteers in action. Among some of these including 2nd year Charlotte Belew, the clumsy Frey, the prodigy Loki, and mysterious Magnus. Throughout the series, each of them demonstrate abilities of a puppeteer at various skill levels. Most of them seems to have some sort of objective as to why they are also at the academy while others lacks a true motive. At the apex of its story, we witness an event that is motivated by a grim threat targeted to one of the puppeteers. Although the mystery is not a genre of this show, there come times when the academy becomes entrenched with suspicions that touches on cases of murder. It becomes intriguing to watch because of the standards involving red herring comes into play with false leads and suspects. It’s not as predictable as some might think as viewers will be able to indulge on the movement of the story.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the series’ story pacing feels peculiar on various occasions that looks typically rushed. There’s a lack of characterization involving its cast including Rashin. His past is only briefly glanced upon on various occasions but rarely discussed in full details. While supporting characters such as Charlotte gets more of their past unraveled, Rashin’s backgrounds are vague and is only motivated by vengeance. Thus, characterization feels a bit shallow in this series. Most of the main supporting characters only get some spotlight while others are colored with generics such as the constant apologizing or androphobia. They lack personalities such as Charlotte, Frey, and Yaya. Even more so, there are characters that are introduced on particular episodes with little depth explored on them as well. Being a one cour show, character development suffers on various degrees. There’s just little emphasis on most of them. While the series avoids the breather episode (onsen, beach, etc), there’s bits of fan service that seems out of place. Yaya plays the central role of this as she showers Rashin with affections and attempts to act like his “wife”. The result is usually a scolding on the receiving end with neither party getting satisfaction. Rashin is just one of those guys that are too focused on their goals to care about pity ideas such as love. In fact, the romance of this series is blend and hollow. Don’t expect any development in the romance territory at all. This isn’t a love story of a hero trying to save their princess.<br />
<br />
The art style of this series is peculiar. It may take a bit to get used to because of its lavish brightness and mechanical like coloring. Most characters in the series are generic in particular Yaya and Charlotte. Other characters such as Shouko and Frey reveals more cleavage than should. Thankfully, most of the automatons have diversity. None of them look similar but instead gives off a unique appearance that can be noticeable. However, the action scenes sometimes seems out of space with its usage of CGI and special effects. On the other hand, backgrounds fits the setting well for its time era with its stylish architectures giving off its old English look.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack wise, the series is tolerable and at times stands out above others. However, some of the voice actors and actresses’ role as the characters can be a bit frustrating to endure. Yaya’s VA Hitomi Harada plays her role well but it’s a hardship to deal with her obsessive nature. Charlotte’s tsundere like voice can also be frustrating while most of the other characters’ tones hardly stands out. The OST achieves satisfaction with its pacing and matches its tones well, in particular action scenes. The OP and ED songs conveys its theme well. More noticeable is the ED song however that has garnered attention with its catchy tone of ‘Maware, Maware, Maware’.<br />
<br />
This series might seem like an odd ball in the mix but it can hold itself together on occasions. However, don’t expect deep character development or a linear plot of progression. The show sets up itself with arcs but only focuses on its plot points with little emphasis on friendship, romance, or other significant themes of morality. Some stories seems a bit rushed because of its episodes pacing as well. The way to enjoy the show is to probably focus on Rashin’s motives whether it’s his quest for vengeance or goal to become Wiseman. It does portrays its premise well in technical aspects with the mechanics and setting. The tournament itself is not a pivotal factor of this show however. This is because the series also feels obligatory on occasions to pull out clichés with fan service scenes or meaningless dialogues. If it was designed as a comedy, this show would work out magnificently. But since it does have a serious plot, there’s a less reasoning for that. The way Unbreakable Machine Dolls almost is crafted will leave different impressions for everyone.

    Oh boy... Where to start? Unbreakable Machine Doll is quite the mixed bag. On one hand it seems to have enough ecchi to appeal to ecchi fans. On the other hand it seems to handle it&#039;s fighting scenes quite well albeit with the use of a little CGI here and there. Action fans may enjoy it as well.<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
<br />
Our story takes place in the early 20th century (1900&#039;s). Where science co-existing with magic has come together to develop living objects that have their own personalities. Fast forward a few years and the story follows a young puppeteer by the name of Raishin Akabane and his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125321">
        machine doll, Yaya. The two must work together to achieve the title of &quot;Wiseman&quot; at their academy. A sort of king capable of almost anything. The only problem is that due to Raishin&#039;s poor grades he ends up in second last for qualifying in the &quot;battle royale&quot; out of thousands of students. And only the top 100 students can participate.<br />
<br />
This is a great premise and I was excited to see how it would be executed. Alas the battles while being amazingly animated... End up being no longer than a few minutes. The thing about this season only being 12 episodes is that it has a ton of pacing problems so I can&#039;t blame them. Okay, imagine driving down a straight road with a nice fast care. Now imagine that on each side of the road there is the most incredible scenery you have ever seen. Now imagine that the car is slowly speeding up... getting faster, and faster. Before you know it, the lovely scenery has now become a blur of boobs and moe blobs. What was that? Was that just some actual plot? I can&#039;t tell. In short, this anime&#039;s first season just needed to be twice as long.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
<br />
Oh my Keima Katsuragi... The art is superb. The lighting is handled beautifully. You can actually see time passing as the episodes go on as dusk turns to night and night turns to dawn. The characters look uniquely 20th century-esque. This anime is pure eye candy I didn&#039;t even mind the fanservice, and I hate fanservice. But damn... The scenery is just immersing. I actually wanted to be there. The CGI wasn&#039;t all that bad, it&#039;s barely noticeable but it knocked this score down by 1 point.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
<br />
The OP and ED differ so much, but are both amazing in their own aspects. The OP gets you pumped and the ED gets you excited for the next episode... Which was kind of bad... If you followed this anime from episode 1. The OST was immersive, enhancing fight scenes pumping me up. It also handled dramatic scenes quite well, where Raishin had flashbacks about certain past events that I don&#039;t want to spoil but the OST definitely helped with me sympathizing with him. I have to say the the art coupled with the Sound is what made this show.<br />
<br />
Characters: 6<br />
<br />
This has to be the show&#039;s weakest point. Raishin is a pretty generic MC. His motivation for getting &quot;Wiseman&quot; is just a revenge driven plot device. Yaya is his doll that he uses to fight she is outright in love with him for some unknown reason always wanting to either marry, f*ck him, or both. This is a long running joke throughout the series and is kind of funny but gets annoying sometimes. Those are our MC&#039;s... I won&#039;t talk about any other characters because they are either unimportant or are introduced after episode 1. Just know that every girl student he meets will want his dick for reasons unclear. They are also all slightly moe... Just slightly...<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
<br />
I enjoyed this show immensely. The art is what kept me and the Music is what left me wanting more. The stage has been set with this first season, so I&#039;m looking forward to season 2. The premise is quite fresh and has to be explored further. Characters were unique except for their shared moe blobness.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
<br />
The only problems I had were the use of CGI and Yaya got annoying at some points with her jealousy over other girls wanting MC&#039;S dick. Still, I loved everything else about this show and I think it is better than most of this season&#039;s anime. I dropped quite a few shows but not this one. I didn&#039;t really like all the moe but it was bearable to say the least.<br />

    First of all, let me warn you that this is my first review, so I am not very adept at it. I&#039;ll do my best to give an accurate review of this show, though! I will also try not to give any spoilers.<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
Assuming that you have not read the light novel or the manga (in which case, you would have watched this show a long time ago), the story if fantastic but slightly confusing. The plot revolves around a futuristic world that has created magic through science. However, humans cannot utilize this magic themselves--rather, they use dolls/machines, or automatons, that can use magic from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180548">
        humans to perform tasks and battles. <br />
<br />
The entirety of these 12 episodes is focused on Raishin, a boy of a highly prestigious martial arts clan. His clan is wiped out by someone, but as Raishin is on the verge of death, he is saved by Shouko, a doll-maker. Raishin is given0 Yaya, an extremely cute yet slightly yandere girl automaton, until he can fulfill his revenge.<br />
<br />
As you can probably guess, this anime is filled with action and some romantic comedy (Yaya&#039;s obsessive nature is quite something, although it&#039;s not at Gasai Yuno&#039;s level from Mirai Nikki), as you see both Raishin and Yaya&#039;s growth at a magic school. Even though Raishin is ranked 2nd to last in terms of intelligence, it is quite enjoyable to see how outstanding he is in battle situations.<br />
<br />
Now for the confusion: the plot is extremely fast paced. Meaning, not everything is explained. This anime makes a high priority in setting cliffhangers at the end of most episodes, and as a result, many explanations are left to be too short. They are explained thoroughly in the light novel (or so I hear), but these confusions are not too important, and can easily be found online if you are set on clarifying some things. I would give this anime a 9/10 if it didn&#039;t have such confusion, but  because of this flaw this anime deserves a 7/10 for its story.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
Is there a need to explain? You can see for yourself if you watch the first 2 minutes of the episode :) Action scenes are extremely well placed, and character designs are simply amazing. The art in this anime is better than most. There were some CG moments where the art looked a bit funky, but other than that the art is awesome.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
Oh my. The sounds in this anime are simply amazing. The opening is amazing, the endings (yes, there are more than one) are amazing, and the voices are amazing. The action scenes&#039; sounds are great as well. <br />
<br />
Character: 6<br />
Now this has some problems. I&#039;m sure the anime could have a much higher rating if there was a second season, but for the first 12 episodes, there isn&#039;t much character development. Raishin is the daring person who strives to save people, as always. Yaya is obsessive and strong, although we can see a power development in her. Everyone else retains pretty much the same character save for Charl, who has minimal character development as well. However, this does not mean that the characters are not interesting. There are many, MANY points where you find that the characters are more than what they seemed--the author peels the characters one by one, revealing their true natures and powers. This isn&#039;t exactly development, of course, but rather an introduction. This is why I regret that there is no second season.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
Despite its flaws, I must claim that I enjoyed this to the fullest. Great art, amazing action, and funny romance/harem scenes made this an extremely enjoyable anime. There are a lot of things to critique, but no matter how much there are I enjoyed this 10/10.<br />
<br />
Overall:7<br />
Because of its bland character development and its slightly confusing plot, I would give this anime a 7. Don&#039;t get me wrong though--I highly recommend this anime to any anime lover. If you watch anime for enjoyment (as I assume most people are), this anime will not turn you down! As you can probably tell, I REALLY want a second season for a reason. I hope you at least check this out! <br />
<br />
P.S. Please feel free to tell me what I could improve about my reviews. Thanks!

    STORY: 5/10 Mediocre<br />
<br />
In truth, I was heavily intrigued by the introduction presented by the first episode. Set in a fantasy world where magic and technology are fused together to form &quot;Machinart&quot; - Machine Magic. The core of Machinart is the development of Automatons, dolls made for battle, and our protagonist, Raishin Akabane is one of the many puppeteers out there: the ones who control the dolls, and fight alongside them.<br />
<br />
At first, the plot focuses on Raishin trying to be the &quot;Wise Man&quot; by winning the &quot;Night of Walpurgis&quot; festival, held by the puppeteer academy he was enrolled into. Originally our hero was driven to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125351">
        Wise Man by the need of vengeance where he vows to kill his brother, instead as the series progresses, Raishin was thrown around into the family feuds, interfering with automaton production in the world, and entering a mess of harem with almost all the girls in the series. <br />
<br />
ART: 7/10 Good<br />
<br />
Unbreakable Machine Doll features plenty of action scenes, and although some of them may be short, all of them are pretty well animated and will not leave action fans disappointed. Some of the character designs are awkward (Shoko and Frey take the cake) and some of the CGI used (particularly Sigmund) feel out of place as the rest of the artwork look so much different, as if two series from different times are put together as one. <br />
<br />
That aside, the British sceneries seen in the series are definitely a delight to see. <br />
<br />
My biggest complaint with the art would be the lower brightness used in the night scenes, my monitor was adjusted to its utmost brightness, yet many of the fighting scenes in the dark are a strain to watch. HD helps a bit, but if the night scenes are a bit brighter, it would’ve been much better.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 8/10 Very Good<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is pretty decent, particularly the battle scenes, where I am very fond of the use of string intruments into the theme. The piano tracks used in slower scenes are very nice as well.<br />
<br />
OP is pretty average, in my opinion, it’s nothing more than a J-pop song where you can find in a lot of anime openings. ED, however, is probably the catchiest songs you can find this season, and admittedly, one of the main reasons I keep coming back every week. <br />
<br />
The voice acting is fine and nothing much to say here.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: 6/10 Fair<br />
<br />
To sum things up, Unbreakable Machine Doll has stereotypical characters. Raishin is your typical never-give-up, never-say-die, always-helping-others, putting-others-in-front-of-himself type of wonderful man, at least he’s not protected by some heavy plot shield as he always end up in the hospital. Yaya the “strongest automaton in the world” is so crazy about Raishin, that she would do anything for him, anything indeed. Charlotte happens to be the loner, tsundere and a rather poor decision maker. <br />
<br />
The rest of the cast isn’t particularly memorable, but they tend to act in a certain (awkward) manner, probably in the writer’s attempt to make them stand out more, but that makes them rather unreal as characters. <br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 7/10 Good<br />
<br />
The fighting scenes are nice to see; watching Yaya getting jealous whenever Raishin is together with another female is funny; and the ED is catchy as hell. But ultimately, I feel that the weak and often confusing story and the huge amount of very dark night scenes did take away some of the enjoyment from me.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 6/10 Fair<br />
<br />
This series is far from over, hence the story is also left half-assed. But after watching Unbreakable Machine Doll, I feel as if we are only shown the appetizer, and the main course has yet to be served. Should Season 2 be aired sometime in the future, hopefully more things can be cleared up and we get to enjoy the whole picture. <br />

    So this is what cancer feels like huh?<br />
<br />
I&#039;m still gawking at how bad it was.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unbreakable Machine-Doll, or Machine-Doll wa Kizutsukanai in it&#039;s proper Japanese title, is set in a magical steampunk England. This hasn&#039;t really been done before so that&#039;s what&#039;d lure most people into this horrible anime, made out of stupid and chromosomes.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is no story. There really isn&#039;t. The studio&#039;s attitude was disregard plot. Acquire CGI. I suffered through 2 hours and 20 minutes (about 7 episodes) through this disease they dare call Anime.<br />
<br />
 The sound was mediocre at best. The music was decent, but the V.A&#039;s chosen where obnoxious, loud and without

          <span style="display: none;" id="review140775">
        a doubt the most wrong choices for the &quot;characters&quot;. I set characters in quotation marks because there wasn&#039;t much character to ruin.<br />
<br />
 The male protagonist, Raishin is a dumbass (surprise surprise right?) He gets offered sex every day, with the hottest pieces of ass walking on that world, and he blatantly refuses each time. The only one he seems even slightly interested in is some random old chick who is obviously using him. Not only that he turns full emo whenever he can&#039;t even save a robot dog. Also,<br />
<br />
****SPOILERS****<br />
In episode 5 or 6, he turned Yaya into an unbreakable shield, but instead thought &quot;You know what? No, I&#039;m just gonna get my lungs slashed instead of letting the attacker&#039;s sword shatter into a billion pieces against Yaya&#039;s arm. Thus throwing the entire match because he was afraid an unbreakable machine doll would break from some weak-ass opponent.<br />
***************<br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s Yaya. Yaya. She is the most worthless, obnoxious and irritating Anime character I&#039;ve seen in a LONG time. Not since SAO&#039;s Kirito and Asuna have I had the urge to kill myself like that.<br />
<br />
 Then there&#039;s this &quot;Magnus&quot; guy. The typical OP masked guy who may or may not actually be the bad guy. It&#039;s not even the fact that they made him such a Gary Stu, but they even failed at that. He has no personality, and only seems to be able to say &quot;Hmph&quot; and &quot;Tsk&quot;.<br />
<br />
 Then there&#039;s the older teacher woman who already seems to know everything. Gosh. Who ever would have seen that coming?<br />
<br />
 Then there&#039;s Charlotte, the typical blonde tsundere tomboy. Again, nothing new here.<br />
<br />
THEN (Yes I&#039;m going on a rant here) there&#039;s Fray, the obligatory white hair, red eyed anime character you see everywhere, she&#039;s also the busty clumsy one, so another Mary Sue.<br />
<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not gonna bother you all with the other horrible &quot;characters&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
All in all this anime has given me Cancer, Aids, Malaria and Typhus, so I&#039;m just gonna go ahead and die slowly now.

    I can probably sum this review up in 3 words: Needs another season.<br />
<br />
Story 7.5<br />
<br />
The story is probably not the strongest part of this show, but that&#039;s not a problem as the reason for that pertains to plot holes that could be filled with another season. The revenge aspect of the plot is a generic plot element that wasn&#039;t really brought up to an obsessive degree which is good becaUse I would&#039;ve gotten annoyed by hearing about it in virtually every scene.<br />
<br />
Art 8.5<br />
<br />
The art and design really stands out to me, as I like how they used a steampunk style setting and used that in the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review133183">
        majority of the series. The one gripe I do have about it was the jarring transition to CG animation during certain scenes, namely the action scenes, but the CG animation itself was utilized very well, it was just the transition that was the problem for me. The character designs were very intriguing and, at least to me, felt fresh and unique at no point did a character stand out unnecessarily and felt out of place to me.<br />
<br />
Sound 9<br />
<br />
While the opening and ending were probably my favorite ones from the entire year, the opening because of how awesome it was and the ending cause it was catchy as hell(Spin Spin Spin Spin Spin), the soundtrack stood out very well. I like OSTs that know how to set the mood and for me, UMD&#039;s did just that. Two songs in particular were really good and definitely worth a listen to outside of the show, Magica and Bravery Steps(you&#039;ll easily notice them if you look them up), and Bravery Steps is probably one of the best instrumentals I&#039;ve ever listened to.<br />
<br />
Character 8<br />
<br />
This is probably where the best and worst parts of the show lie. While each character is easily likable. They also have ticks that will annoy you if you don&#039;t like seeing that kind of thing in a character. Yaya is probably the character that&#039;ll cause the most division between viewers as while she&#039;s a great supporting main character, her excessive(sometimes bordering on obsessive) loyalty towards Raishin is both a good and bad trait as while she has her moments where her loyalty is tested and that&#039;s great to see, her constant attempts to, for lack of a better phrase, get in Raishin&#039;s pants, tends to get annoying.<br />
<br />
Overall 8.2<br />
<br />
Unbreakable Machine Doll is a good series, it is well worth a watch and at no point was I ever bored by what was going on. Despite some parts that felt rush, it never felt like it was a hindrance on the series itself, the writers put out what absolutely had to be seen or heard and did it exceptionally well. Like I said there are a lot of questions left unanswered and only another season will help. If there isn&#039;t another season, then this show will be badly hurt by the lack of one.

    To get a good idea of what this show is like, just imagine what a 6 year-old boy would write if he was trying to  make a story with &quot;badass&quot; protagonists and &quot;evil&quot; villains. <br />
- It has your generic harem MC (Main Character) who thinks girls have cooties. <br />
- It has the dark&amp;edgy side-characters repeating the same cringe-worthy intro lines every few minutes.<br />
- It has the laughably poorly-written bad guy who is so poorly written that he literally says &quot;My greatest pleasure in life is making people sad&quot;.  Yes, he actually says that.<br />
<br />
As with most harems, the redeeming quality is that the girls

          <span style="display: none;" id="review148247">
        are mostly all great, but the MC is so shitty that the show was still quite bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story 3/10<br />
The universe that the story takes place in is well written. It is a world where magicians control puppets and have them fight. It is fleshed out and the setting has a nice atmosphere that comes across nicely. That&#039;s the good part. The bad part is the events of the story. The MC has some insatiable need to get involved in the business of strangers. The writers couldn&#039;t explain it because it&#039;s so stupid; at one point they even had the MC say &quot;I have no idea why I&#039;m doing this&quot;. Anime with male MCs typically have a problem of having main characters make retarded, implausible, reasonless decisions. This show is no exception. What hurts this show even more is that we are supposed to think of the MC as a badass, despite the fact that he has a phobia of sex and avoids it at all costs. <br />
How the hell is anyone who pretends he doesn&#039;t have a sex drive supposed to be cool/badass? That is really why this show ends up being utter garbage. The girls(especially his partner) are all in love with him and want to have sex with him, yet he always avoids it and acts like the girls are about to kill him whenever one of them tries to bang him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
The art and the art-style is fantastic. The outline lines for the characters are hardly visible. The art is probably the only reason why I was able to watch this dreadful show. While I was watching this, I kept thinking that it&#039;s a huge shame that this great art had to be wasted on adapting such a terrible story.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
Pretty good in the sound department. Great ED. And the OP was good as well, even if the lyrics were so edgy that it was cringe-worthy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character:  1/10 for the male characters<br />
                   8/10 for the female characters<br />
<br />
The male characters are terrible. The male characters besides the main character constantly repeat their own introduction lines over and over again because the writers apparently thought that was &quot;badass&quot;, when in reality it&#039;s embarrassing, because you know that the staff thought it was so cool, when in reality it is so pathetic that it makes you cringe.<br />
The MC behaves in such an implausible way that its infuriating to watch. He has no desire to have sex with any of the women who want to bang him, even when they are naked on top of him. He gets annoyed by the concept of sex. The only thing he cares about is getting involved in other people&#039;s personal business. He doesn&#039;t have a desire for romance, or love, or sex. However, he has an insatiable desire to help random people for no reason (once again, he himself states that he has no idea why he does it. There is no reason for it. The writers just shallowly make him do these things so that there is a story).<br />
The female characters are great for the most part. They&#039;re all cute eye-candy and they all nicely represent their archetype that they were written as. They all have generic personalities (e.g. being a typical modern tsundere, or an overly attached yandere), but I&#039;m fine with that. Anime girl archetypes tend to be great in my opinion, so I&#039;m fine with typical anime girls. I wish there were more huge titties though.<br />
Frey best girl.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3/10<br />
The main character&#039;s retarded behavior ruined the show for me. I&#039;m getting sick of Japan writing such dense male main characters who are always scared of sex. It&#039;s ruined so many shows.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 3/10<br />
If you&#039;re desperately looking for a waifu, then you could try watching this show. Other than that, it&#039;s not worth your time. The generic main character ruins this show with his unrealistic decisions and actions and his phobia of sex.<br />
 <br />

    I am a humble and tolerant man. But there are 3 things that I simply can&#039;t forgive. People who give me orders, people who stand against me, and people who tell me that my opinions are invalid. - Loki<br />
<br />
All right, so I have decided to review the anime &quot;Unbreakable Machine Doll&quot; which is basically a light novel adaptation by company Lerche, who directed one of my favorite anime, Danganronpa &amp; Carnival Phantasm<br />
<br />
STORY (8):<br />
The story covers 3 chapters of the light novel. The first chapter involves Yaya &amp; Raishin gets to know Charolette &amp; Sigmund at Walpurgis Machineart Academy. The 2nd chapter involves the introduction of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125225">
        new characters like Loki and Frey. The 3rd chapter focuses on Charolette&#039;s sister, Henriette, and how their relationship as sisters develop.<br />
<br />
Walpurgis Machineart Academy is a school whereby they train the puppeteers to control properly their automatons. In the 1st chapter, the school organizes a tournament to the top 100 students in the academy. Whoever wins the tournament, he or she will be crowned &quot;Wiseman&quot;, known as the Great Puppeteer.<br />
<br />
Every chapter has one main villain. Of course this is important in most action anime.<br />
<br />
ART (7):<br />
The art style was ok, although the colors are very bright.<br />
<br />
SOUND (9):<br />
I honestly loved the opening and the ending. The opening is &quot;Annica&quot; that is sung by Hitomi Harada. The ending goes Maware Maware. By the way, there are some voice actors from Baka &amp; Test who voiced the main characters like for example Hiro Shimono voiced Raishin &amp; Hiromi Harada voiced Yaya.<br />
<br />
Hiro Shimono voiced Akihisa from Baka &amp; Test while Hiromi Harada voiced Himeji from Baka &amp; Test. I was pulled into the anime thanks to these voice actors.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER (8):<br />
So far, in every chapter, we learn about their backstory of each of the characters like Raishin, Yaya, Charolette, Frey, Loki &amp; Henriette.<br />
<br />
Raishin: He was incapable of combat but he can control his automaton, Yaya. He was ranked the 2nd lowest in the class due to the fact that he has the 2nd lowest grades in the exam. In fact, he has determination although sometimes he gets easily frustrated. He reminds me of Eren Jeager from Attack on Titans<br />
<br />
Yaya: She is cheerful and energetic and she likes to tease Raishin. One time in the beginning of episode 1, she says &quot;Yaya is cute, she is the cutest in the world&quot;, I was like so surprised that she tried to put a spell on Raishin. By the way, she is skilled in combat. Yayaboombastic<br />
<br />
Charolette: She is a tsundere. She is very hard on Raishin when she thought that she is doing something perverted.<br />
<br />
Loki: As you have seen in my first sentence, I have been inspired by Loki&#039;s statement in episode 5. Loki is smart, calm and composed.<br />
<br />
Frey: She is quite shy but she is kind at heart.<br />
<br />
Henriette: We only see her in chapter 3, she is also quite shy and gets easily timid. I would love to know more about the sister relationship development.<br />
<br />
I really have no problem with the characters, but I would like to know more about them.<br />
<br />
CONCLUSION (8):<br />
<br />
So far, I enjoyed this anime despite some lack of information of some episodes. Especially, the last episode whereby the boss in the 3rd chapter disappears. There is basically an OVA which might cover the remaining chapters. I doubt that the OVA might cover the remaining 9 chapters of the light novel. But it would be wonderful to see how the story unfolds.<br />
<br />
I just really hope there will be a season 2 so that this season will cover all the chapters up to 12. <br />
<br />
I can understand that the producers did not know that there are 12 chapters of the light novel just before they created this anime. So I grade based on how worthwhile it is to watch the 1st 3 chapters that is adapted into an anime.<br />
<br />
Overall, I enjoyed this anime. The voice acting was good and the characters are fun. So I give this anime an 8 out of 10.<br />
<br />
So in conclusion, here is my wish to MAL.<br />
<br />
&quot;Merry X&#039;mas &amp; Happy New Year&quot;.

    When I first watched the upcoming fall anime trailers i thought Machine-Doll wa Kizutsukanai would become my favoured fall anime but instead became my third favourite. Based on the light novel Kikou Shoujo. Here&#039;s my personel opinion :<br />
<br />
Story: Just keep watching there&#039;s more than meets the eye! Cool yet very emotional protaganist Raishin &amp; his doll familliar Yaya whose love for her master is beyond boundaries.<br />
<br />
Art: The only bad side about this anime is crappy CG usage in some action scenes!<br />
Lately anime production studios are using too much crappy CG to save a lot of budget but atleast this one doesn&#039;t have slugish movements like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review121737">
        Ars Nova or Tokyo Raven etc...<br />
<br />
Sound: BGM is great, Seiyuu s are ok too, no problems so far.<br />
<br />
Character: Yaya is moe &amp; funny. The very unique art style fits the best for Yaya!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Unlike most fall animes i watch this anime with utmost high priority.<br />
<br />
Overall: And let&#039;s hope they will make some follow up season or something in the future.

    At first I was like this, &quot;This show might be good.&quot;, but I was horribly wrong. Not only did it make my hate for harems more vehement, but it downgraded what possible could have been a better story.<br />
<br />
The story could have held up. Not really, it still would have been a piece of shit. The machine doll premise piqued my interest, but it could&#039;ve been replaced with a thousand other plot devices and still would&#039;ve been terrible. I understood the vengeance thing, but that main character fucker should&#039;ve died. It was like, exactly like what happened to the Uchiha Clan from Naruto. His whole family

          <span style="display: none;" id="review144785">
        got murdered by his asshole brother. I&#039;m guessing his brother was to be misunderstood in the end. The female characters were just there for the main character, and every other male character was an asshole. I don&#039;t know what&#039;s up with anime and making every villain just to make the main character look better. You don&#039;t have to make all the bad guys contrarily less better than the MC. And female characters can be there other than for fan service!!! Who know? Most of them literally had no purpose, and the MC had to do something to solve there problem. What almost had me interested was how that blonde dragon girl and that Felix guy might&#039;ve had something. It could&#039;ve happened, but naw the MC must obtain all ass in a 10 mile radius. <br />
<br />
The art hurt my nuts. I had to turn the fucking brightness all the way up just to see anything. Everything looked soft and shit. Were solid lines really that hard to make? The CG was like a very uncomfortable rimjob, and titties were everywhere. These two things don&#039;t usually go hand in hand.<br />
<br />
I never actually heard the opening, I always skipped it. The ending was okay. It sounded like a vocaloid song I heard once. The metal slashing sound, explosion, and almost every sound in here were very unpleasant to the ears. Some the voice actors were kinda annoying.<br />
<br />
Speaking of annoying, Yaya was that. She was always jealous or horny like what the fuck? MC was a duller Sasuke Uchiha if that was possible.He never fucking died either that doesn&#039;t really happen. You die when you are killed. Dragon girl I don&#039;t even remember, so she was probably unimportant. White haired dog girl did something once I think. There was a teacher or something. Someone had a sister I think. Who looked exactly like them. That brother of dog girl who didn&#039;t like things. The MC&#039;s brother was the bad guy. There was another bad guy. That&#039;s all the characters, I think. The stupid ones don&#039;t matter.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You see those spaces? It was more entertaining pressing space bar eight times than it was watching this series.<br />
<br />
<br />
The machine doll broke my hopes. I can never watch another mediocre anime because of this show. Now the world is, sort of like the artwork, dull. I hate everything, and when my friends talk about anime, I vomit. My condolences to whoever had to watch this show.<br />
<br />
Actually I&#039;m exaggerating. If you enjoyed this show, then good for you. You are not human. I hope you find a place to live. A place that&#039;ll accept you. I used to love dolls.<br />
<br />

    I didn&#039;t think the actual story of this was anything special. But honestly the characters in it are excellent. Raishen and Yaya&#039;s interactions are priceless. I&#039;m not sure I liked Char that much, but the rest of the characters were excellent. <br />
<br />
I think I liked the ending song much better than the opener though and wish they were reversed. <br />
<br />
Raishen generally is a very sharp guy, well except for one episode where he turns into a complete idiot briefly, but soon he&#039;s right back to his calm calculating self. <br />
<br />
Yaya is just awesome. I seriously want to know the backstory on this one. While the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review189705">
        Shoko flashbacks are great, in the Ovas that come with the Limited Edition hint that Yaya hated him when they first met, but now she&#039;s obsessed with him, and thinks they&#039;re married and on their honeymoon. <br />
<br />
You just KNOW Shoko must have manipulated that into happening, especially considering Raishen&#039;s reactions to having a doll want him that badly. <br />
<br />
Yes, I really get off on Yaya and her antics, she&#039;s a cutie.

    First and foremost, I will make my review spoiler free as I can. It’s safe to read even if you haven’t watched the show.<br />
Let’s start me review, shall we?<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
During early 20th century, by discovering “Magic circuits”, scientists found a way to give life to countless things. These magic circuits are made from complex magic and highly developed technology. Magic circuits were put into different objects to bring them to life and even give them human-like traits. An object that has magic circuits installed in it is called an “Automaton”, with humans called “Puppeteers” controlling them and providing them the “Mana “ they need to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review167959">
        do certain actions .<br />
Akabane Raishin is a puppeteer attending Royal Academy. Together with a beautiful teenage girl Yaya, who’s actually Raishin’s puppet. Royal Academy is a school specializing in training puppeteers and crowning them as “Wiseman”. Wiseman is a title given to the strongest puppeteers. Raishin has to defeat every single puppeteer in the academy to be crowned as a Wiseman. <br />
That’s basically the gist of the plot. You’ll learn some more of it by watching it.<br />
7’s a perfect score to gauge Machine-doll’s plot/story.  Not so rare these days if you ask me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
Amazing CG battle sequences alone deserves a 9. Aside from the great CGs, the details on everything are smooth. This wouldn’t surprise most of us by now.  It is 2014, nothing is impossible anymore (aside from me having a girlfriend). A point I would like to add, the manga’s art style’s a bit (itsy bitsy tiny bit) different from the Anime. Not much to mention here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 8<br />
ONE YAYA, PLEASE! NO, MAKE THAT DOUBLE—NO, THREE PLEASE! An obsessed girl character isn’t that really rare for a harem. Female leads and supporting characters in Machine-doll doesn’t differ much from other harem girls. Every girl goes gaga for Raishin. Meh, wouldn’t be a harem show if he wasn’t flocked on by girls, no? Anyhow, every girl in his harem has their own different personality.  Telling who’s who might spoil you, so I won’t utter any word about them. They’re all drawn perfectly, breast size, pantsu color—I’m not trying to sound like a pervert, ok!? Lastly, they’re all waifu material.<br />
<br />
Music: 8<br />
<br />
Given that the series has only 12 episodes, there’s only one OP and ED theme.<br />
Maware, maware, maware, maware, maware, maware, maware, maware. Don’t mind me, I’m just singing my heart out. That’s the catchy ending theme of Machine-doll. The seiyuu(s) sung it themselves! Yaya’s singing in it, too, of course. It’s so catchy I’ve been playing it for numerous times, even now while I’m writing this!  I didn’t like the OP theme though. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
I enjoyed Machine-doll a lot more that I had expected. Part of it is it’s been a while since I’ve watched a series with these enough fan service. The occasional pantsu shots and &quot;other&quot; fan service moments were satisfying for me. After all, these are what most viewers (not counting out myself) find attractive. So if you’re a fan of harem/ecchi/seinen/action shows, you’d definitely like Machine-doll. <br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
I first encountered Machine-doll, if I’m not mistaken, around 2012, ‘course it was on a manga site. I click on the advance search button, clicked genres: ecchi; seinen; harem; action (three of them are my favorite genres). And then, BAMF! Machine-doll was on the first page of the results. That time, Machine-doll was about 25+ chapters. So you can imagine how hang-up I am when I finished reading them. Then last year, Machine-doll has finally turned into an Anime! I was so happy I forgot to watch it for a year (lol.  Actually, I forgot to put it on my watch list).<br />
<br />
Plot-wise, Machine-doll isn&#039;t really a rarity these days. Truth be told, I find it &quot;most common&quot;. But that doesn’t mean I don’t like it. A lot might overlook Machine-doll because of the common plot. I find the 12 episodes too short for a series to show its real plot—how deep it is. Or maybe, Machine-doll is a failure because it hasn’t showed any serious developing within the 12 episodes? Nevertheless, Machine-doll is still a working progress, so it has a lot of potential to get better. I just hope they won’t take too much time. Lastly, I assure you that Machine-doll isn’t a waste of time. But, sadly, if you’re a fan of “deep-complicated” plots, you better pass this up. Ultimately, don’t let an amateur so-called reviewer, such as me decide for you. <br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
I still want my own Yaya.  =(<br />

    Well, Unbreakable Machine-Doll finished airing in japan last week and I feel I should post my thoughts on it. Unbreakable Machine-Doll takes place during the early 20th century where magic and technology are used as one. This is called Machinart. The ones who practice this art are called Puppeteers. Puppeteers use this art to develop animated machines or “Dolls”. These dolls while controlled by the puppeteer, are free thinking. The dolls are powered by these circuits which were originally used for military purposes, however, over time they have spread worldwide.<br />
<br />
The series focuses on Puppeteer Raishin Akabane and his Doll Yaya. Raishin has made it his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review126807">
        goal to enter a sort of tournament and become the Wiseman. The wiseman is considered the best puppeteer and is a sort of king. Placement in the tournament is only available to the top 100 students in the school. However, his plan becomes more complicated when he receives his test grade as one of the worst students in the academy, which earns him the nickname Second Last. I give the story a 7/10<br />
<br />
The art in this anime is absolutely superb! The characters looked well drawn and they looked like they belonged in that time period! I wasn’t a big fan of the CGI they put in the fight scenes, but I didn’t notice it at times. I give the artwork to this anime a 8/10<br />
<br />
The voice acting in this anime was pretty good in my opinion and the music was also great! I loved the opening music. However, I’m not one to stick around for the ending theme song and the one in this anime (While catchy) didn’t encourage me at all to stay (This is my opinion. I’ve heard others have liked it a lot). Overall, I give the sound an 8/10<br />
<br />
The characters here in this anime in my opinion could have been better. Everyone seemed too confusing at times. Raishin is your standard male protagonist, Yaya is obsessively in love with Raishin (As well as every other unique girl in this anime) and can cause a scene at times in public. Some of the characters do this annoying catchphrase thing where they repeat the same sentence over and over again while changing the last part (This in my opinion is very annoying at times).  I think the characters are the weakest part of this anime. I give them a 6/10.<br />
<br />
Overall, the anime is decently written, the voice acting and sound is great as well as the art, and the characters are very generic. I would recommend this anime to others and would watch a season 2 (If one is made). I give it an 8/10

    Machine-Doll wa Kizutsukanai<br />
<br />
Though it tries to play itself off as anything but, Machine-Doll wa Kizutsukanai is a harem anime. I am no big writer of reviews though this anime hit me in so many ways I had to add my two cents into it. Machine-Doll has a great concept though there are so many flaws one can not overlook it. I will touch on the things I enjoyed about this anime as few as they are. The artwork for this anime is spectacular. Cute with enough detail that each scene it becomes clear that the artist put in lot of time. The score to this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review134975">
        anime is well done matching the background music to enhance the emotional aspect the scene was trying to captivate. Now onto the things I disliked. Most might be wondering why I say this is a harem anime, the conversation between chars always leads to sexual innuendos, panty shots and girls blushing and getting jealous over the main char. What I found most annoying about this anime was the whininess of ALL the female chars. Even in situations where seriousness should have been taken it was pushed to whiny emo “I&#039;m worthless” crap from the female chars. The storyline, while had a great concept lacked any real information give in the anime. I was hoping as the anime continued it would go deepening into the plot, though it continued to ignore any real depth. The fight scenes were decent enough though once again lack of information led to it being nothing more than an excuse to watch big breasted women jump around. If this anime was any longer I will admit I would not have forced my way through the entire thing. Though to each their own. So if you enjoy big breasted whiny emo girls, this anime is right up your alley. <br />

    How people view ecchi anime, in the anime community, are vastly different. Some people can’t stand it, some people love it, and aren’t afraid to show it, others are fans but aren’t too proud of it, and there are some people who are somewhere in between. With all of these differing opinions on ecchi anime, it’s hard to determine whether an ecchi series is any good or not. How much you like a series riddled with fanservice and that, usually, doesn’t have a very compelling plot is, naturally, entirely dependent on your opinion of fanservice and how much the plot of a series contributes to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190051">
        your personal enjoyment of it. Now, occasionally, like in any other genre you will have shows that will try to break the mold that has been established by so many shows that have been released before it. In the case of ecchi anime, that often is having a really good story line to go along with the inevitable breast and panty shots. That is something that Unbreakable Machine-Doll (Machine-Doll wa Kizutsukanai) has tried to accomplish. Now was it successful, or didn’t it fall flat on its face?<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Unbreakable Machine-Doll’s story takes place in the 20th century, a time where there have been several technological advancements, especially with the use of magic. During this time period, there was a tremendous discovery. By fusing scientific and magical knowledge, humans were able to create a device that can bring inanimate objects to life, an even give them their own personalities. The militarily use for this technology came in the form of puppets. They would bring puppets to life, and train people to use these puppets for military purposes.<br />
<br />
The story revolves around Raishin Akabane, a member of the Akabane clan—a clan that specializes in the use of puppets. One day, a mysterious assailant attacked his clan, and nearly all of them were killed. Raishin wants to avenge his clansmen’s deaths so he joins the Royal Academy, a prestigious school for puppeteers, in order to become the best puppeteer in the world.<br />
<br />
The most interesting thing in the story is its setting. As most of you probably have noticed, most anime take place in Japan, with the second most popular setting probably being space. So to have an entire series take place in 20th century England is a nice change of pace. I was also really interested in the story’s premise. Just looking at the plot synopsis got me interested in watching this series. But, unfortunately the story never gets any better than “interesting.”<br />
<br />
The first issue that I have with the story is the way that it goes about explaining everything to the viewer. It will introduce a subject, or term, to you without defining exactly what it is or what’s going on. They will have entire conversations about these things without giving you any clues or context to what they are talking about—until the conversation is already over. But, by that point, I was already annoyed. This happens several times throughout the course the series, and it gets even worse at the end, but I’ll get to that later. It’s not like they are being vague, and mysterious. They’re not giving you hints or clues, and trying to let you figure things out on your own. They’re just not telling you anything.<br />
<br />
The show also tries to break away from some of the stereotypical ecchi attempts at humor, i.e. the male protagonist “tripping” and grabbing the breasts of a female character or the male protagonist having several nose bleeds because of the female characters. While there are definitely some moments that are fairly cliché in the ecchi genre, for the most part, the humor in Unbreakable Machine-Doll at least a little bit different from what you’d typically see in the genre. The problem is that it uses the same types of jokes and gags over, and over, and over again. And, honestly, they weren’t even that funny in the first place.<br />
<br />
Another issue I have with the story is the way that they magically create and insert actions, conversations, and random knowledge whenever it’s convenient for Raishin. He’ll be in the middle of a battle, in which he’s getting beaten pretty badly, and all of a sudden he’ll turn the tables on his opponent and gain the upper hand. How does he do this? Apparently, he had it all planned out all along. Some random bystander will start commentating about how Raishin must’ve known about such and such all along (or “deduced” it right before hand), and had already had a plan in his mind to counter act such and such by doing such and such off screen. They don’t even show you flashbacks of when he did whatever they said he did, they just flash a picture on the screen, there will be more on that in the animation section of this review, and say that he had planned it all along.<br />
<br />
Now my biggest problem with the series is the way that it ended, because, it really didn’t. Remember what I said about the series picking and choosing when to explain things that they mention in their character’s dialogue? During the last two episodes they say things that were never mentioned in the series before hand, and must’ve planned on explaining things during the second season. The problem is that there is not second season, and there will probably never be one at this point. The unanswered questions are compounded because the season finale didn’t conclude the two main storylines during the course of the season: Raishin getting his revenge and becoming the best puppeteer. The only things were solved by the last episode were a few side character’s stories, and it felt like the main story was put on hold. All of this added up to a very unsatisfying conclusion, to an underwhelming story.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
<br />
Overall, the animation in Unbreakable Machine-Doll is solid. The characters are all distinctive and nicely animated, and the background scenery is well done. The fight scenes in this series are also well done, even though I do have a problem with the way they chose integrate still images into them. Instead of seeing a fight scene with every frame being animated, you’ll see quick flashes of still images, which are supposed to supplement the animation for those particular actions. This happens fairly frequently, and it’s not only jarring, but it’s also disappointing. Several of the moments that were reduced to only still images would’ve looked much better if they were animated, and they would’ve made the fight scenes that much better.<br />
<br />
Another thing I liked about the animation was that there wasn’t a ridiculous amount of fanservice. Was it there, and perfectly noticeable? Certainly, but it didn’t happen anywhere near as often as I expected it to. In fact, there were several episodes were there was little to no fanservice, and I thought that was refreshing.<br />
<br />
It also should be noted that there seems to be some brightness issues with the lighter colors used in the series. Some of the whites, in particular, look extremely bright, and even a little blurry, on screen.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Unbreakable Machine-Doll’s soundtrack (OST) is fairly large, and pretty varied. There are definitely plenty of songs to fit every single moment in this series. Most of the OST is split between two song types: soft, airy, and melodic, and epic and grand. The softer songs usually rely on different string instruments and a piano to produce a lighter sound that just feels like it belongs in a fantasy show, which isn’t a bad thing considering that that is pretty much was Unbreakable Machine-Doll is. The other songs use a lot more instruments, and that big orchestral sound is perfect for the fight scenes in this series. The series only has one opening and ending, and I didn’t find either of them particularly special. While I didn’t find anything that I’d be compelled to re-listen to after this review, Unbreakable Machine-Doll’s OST was really good.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
There are two main characters in this series, Raishin and his puppet Yaya. There are also several side characters that you’ll see over the course of the series. I’ll just get this out of the way right now—there is little to no character development for any of the characters in this series. Every character in this series is pretty much the same at the end of the series, as they were at the beginning, with a few very minor exceptions. Thankfully, we do get some background information about most of them, but there are still some characters that we don’t know a whole lot about.<br />
<br />
But, the characters are decently likable and enjoyable to watch. There relationships with one another do actually go through some development over the course of the series. It’s nothing substantial, but it’s definitely noticeable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
As I mentioned earlier, this series never got past just interesting for me. The annoying methods of story telling, repetitive comedy, and lack of an ending didn’t really add to my overall enjoyment of this series. While I was decently entertained by Unbreakable Machine-Doll it’s not something that I’d consider watching again.<br />
<br />
Verdict &amp; Breakdown:<br />
<br />
Story: 2.5/5<br />
<br />
Animation: 3.8/5<br />
<br />
Sound: 3.7/5<br />
<br />
Characters: 2.7/5<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3/5<br />
<br />
Verdict: 3.1/5<br />
<br />
While Unbreakable Machine-Doll isn’t bad, it’s far from being the, “Ecchi anime with a fantastic story,” that some claim it to be.

    I like the loli fanservice in this show which is why I rate this highly, Yaya scenes are the reason I enjoyed the show apart from that, the story is alright, the art is pretty gay and the sounds are decent.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
<br />
This show is basically an upgraded version of black bullet, it is better because there is an interesting plot in this show although it did not overwhelmed me but it did not fail to entertain me as well.<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
<br />
The visuals in the first half of the show was blinding, it was so bright that I couldn&#039;t tell what colour the sky was. Moreover, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325970">
        CG was introduced shamelessly and it was so obvious that I nearly quitted the show however, Yaya&#039;s pantsu was revealed during the process so I decided to hang on.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
<br />
The OP and ED is pretty good and how the OP was used in the final fight is also quite suitable. I don&#039;t remember any osts being played so I guess it is not that memorable.<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
<br />
There are many lolis in this show although I&#039;m not a fan of tsundere lolis but this one is not that annoying so overall characters is probably the best factor of this show.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
<br />
Yeah, I enjoyed this show because of the lolis so characters alone is already enough to really make me enjoy this show.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
<br />
At first I gave this show a 10 but I remembered the unpleasant moments of the bad arts so it downgraded to a 9. This show is probably a 9.7 or 9.8, it could have been a 10/10 if the art is done better.

    first of all, forgive me my english, take in consideration that im a french canadian, but i got the feeling to write a review for this fantastic show,that i think deserve a better rating that only 1 review with 8 as score.<br />
<br />
Story-i think the story was original, i was quite satisfied with the concept, people controlling automates to fight against each other, why not, and the yaya touch with raishin was great to see and cute in same time<br />
<br />
Art- The art was really great, a bit different from usual, but really liked this, whatever the art is lot about self opinion, everyone have different taste

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125487">
        so<br />
<br />
Sound- sound was fine, specialy liked the sound during fight scene<br />
<br />
characters- Each characters had his own personality, but Yaya made really a good show for me, i liked Raishin as well and all support caracthers too<br />
<br />
enjoyment- if i give a note on this, i could easily give 10/10? why? because each time i had finish my episode, i was really looking forward for the next one, there was always a good thriller at the end of each episode to make you want to see absolutely the next, i have watched all the shows of this fall 2013, and i can easily say that machine doll was in my top 5, may be even in my top 3 where i was impatient to see the sequel<br />
<br />
Overall- if you like some fight scene, a little bit of thriller, a funny relationship with the Mc(Raishin) and the main heroine(Yaya) and yeah some ecchi scene(but really not to much, honestly) more about girls questioning their own body(boobs...) i could say there is a little harem at the end, but its really not focused on this aspect, and finally a world where puppets have pretty their own personaly and relationship with their Master, you NEED to see this fabulous show

    Machine-Doll wa Kizutsukanai had a stunning beginning and an amazing world-building idea at the beginning—it was simply brimming with potential! However, as it progressed, the story fell flat and so did the characters. Although it was obvious there was a bigger background plot, there wasn&#039;t enough emphasis on it in each episode and hence the anime felt fragmented, as if you&#039;re just watching random events that ultimately led to nothing.<br />
<br />
One of the major reasons leading to my dropping this anime was the lack of depth regarding most of the characters (though Raishin and Yaya, by default, were slightly more colorful). Half the time I had

          <span style="display: none;" id="review167027">
        been pondering why Charlotte was even part of the story (my conclusion: sexual tension and appeal to male audiences). The attempts at giving characters like Char backstories had been weak as most came off overly dramatic and instead made said characters even less realistic.<br />
<br />
Overall, it was a mediocre anime that basically got too uninteresting for me. Despite the attractive visuals and world-building, Machine-Doll had too passive a storyline. Those with more patience might want to stick through the whole season but if you&#039;re like me and usually give animes half a season—or less—to capture your attention, you might want to skip out on this one.
