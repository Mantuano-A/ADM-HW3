    Campione! well that was probably the best anime i&#039;ve seen with ecchi in it.<br />
Okay guys before starting this i want to make clear that there are 2 versions of ecchi: showoff ecchi and romance ecchi. and this anime has a 90% romance ecchi and 10% showoff ecchi. (showoff echi is KissxSis style, and romance ecchi speaks for it self).<br />
<br />
This is one of those anime&#039;s who is in commen with most harem styled anime&#039;s <br />
Boy gets powerfull or special, Girls love it and are competing against each other.  <br />
But this is one of the few times when you watch anime&#039;s because of ecchi, you really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review102201">
        want the action the happend like fighting. becuase it&#039;s just epic. <br />
<br />
With this in mind i will give my honnest revieuw about this anime, and call out the good points from this anime and the bad one. enjoy.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
well yeay i like it alot i must say, one of these story&#039;s involving taughts in real life like polytheism and the old greek style of believing in their gods. i like it alot that way and that it&#039;s implemented in the anime itself, that pretty unique.<br />
also the idea of becomming a kind of Hero after killing a god is awesome, With some extra Fanservice i think they did a great job with the story.<br />
<br />
art:<br />
basic art like most anime&#039;s not the best not the worst. lack in detail lack in extra face expressions. well yeay you have to get used to this in anime&#039;s which aren&#039;t in the top 100 of the anime list. still a decent job, but nothing to look out for<br />
<br />
Sound: is like all animes just neutral, nothing special. pretty much the same story as the art, but again you have to get used to it.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Well yeay the first time accualy that the origin of the characters is inplemented in the anime: like speaking italian the first time they see the boy. and getting old habbits form back home which is nicely done. good artwork on the characters and great feeling expressions, again not to much face expressions.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment, that&#039;s up to you, I loved it and i think this has to be the most enjoyable anime to watch for me at this moment but well yeay everybody has different interest.<br />
<br />
overall: <br />
I need to be honnest i think this anime would be able to get a 9, but if i look in a way of writing a revieuw, i would say 8. well yeay a great anime to have some fun. and i recomend it to you if you prefer it that way.<br />
<br />
overall recomended to Ecchi lovers, romance lovers, action lovers and Magic usage lovers.<br />
Not recomended to People who are to serious and can&#039;t stand anything unrealisticly in ecchi/romance wise.<br />
<br />
Thank&#039;s for reading, Any suggestions or pointers for me? send me a message i want to inprove myself in making these reviews, My english isn&#039;t the best out there so sorry for that. <br />
<br />
<br />

    Having read the Light Novel,I have to say this anime is quite rushed in the storyline. Eventhough it ended in Ena&#039;s arc they could easily made it 20+ episodes if they put more details in the anime<br />
<br />
Story-7<br />
Great plot.It was definitely nice to watch,I could easily give this a 9 but because they ignored too many little details I have to give it a 7. I mean Ena&#039;s battle with Erica prior Godou&#039;s meeting with Ena is not in the anime.<br />
<br />
Art-9<br />
The art is nice,It was to my liking.I love anime with this kind of art.It is free flowing and theres not much I can say about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review72379">
        it<br />
<br />
Sound-9<br />
The sound is great.The ques for the music always fits the mood and the battles scenes have interesting sounds(especially the Golden Sword)<br />
<br />
Character-9<br />
All the characters are great.They put in effort to introduce everyone and although Im kinda pissed off by Godou taking Liliana-because I like her as well,but its in the story so Its a trivial matter- but other than that,everyone was developed well in the story and I really got to know them all.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-7<br />
Well,I gave this a 7 because the anime left out the details that I really want animated and they kinda twisted the storyline a bit but it didn&#039;t stray from the LN so,Im satisfied with that.<br />
<br />
Overall-8<br />
I won&#039;t say I hate it because I rather enjoyed the whole anime.It is one of the animes that fit my likings although the story was terribly rushed.

    To expect an elaborate storyline, unexpected plot twists, and incredible character development from an ecchi harem show would be one of the greatest you mistakes you can ever make. I came into Campione with no expectations at all. I merely came to watch an ecchi harem and you know what I got? An awesome show that understands how to make a story despite having fan service and a harem. <br />
<br />
Campione is a story about a guy named Godou Kusanagi who ends up killing the Persian God of Victory, Verethragna. As a result, he receives Verethragna’s power and the title of God Slayer. After that, he

          <span style="display: none;" id="review176273">
        basically goes around killing out of control gods no one else can take care of. <br />
<br />
The story may not be refreshing, but hey, it’s a still a story and a coherent one at that. You’re not going to gasp at anything or cry, nope, you’re just going to enjoy the action and smile at the romance. <br />
<br />
Campione actually does have one unique aspect to it. The way he defeats the Gods is through an ability known as Warrior. In a nutshell, if he has sufficient knowledge of the enemy, their defenses begin to crumble and eventually they become mortal, thus making it easier to kill them. What makes it so interesting that he doesn’t just say he knows a lot about the God then proceed to kill him, he actually tells us what he knows. Regardless of whether or not the information about the Gods is valid, I still found it to be one of the best parts of the show. Even if the information isn&#039;t true, I felt like I learned something and it was information that actually fascinated me. There’s just something enjoyable about hearing about the origins of Gods of all cultures. I’m sure you’ll love this part of the story too.<br />
<br />
Action speaks louder than words, so obviously the whole show isn’t just talking on and on and on about some God’s life. Godou has plenty of other abilities. He has a group of 12 incarnation abilities known as Verethragna’s authorities. To be more specific, he can summon a bull that rivals Hercules’ power or a white stallion with the power of the sun. Each one has a chant, so whenever it felt like he was about to chant, I was always excited and ready to see which animal would come out and how much damage it’d do to the opponent. However, they also have a condition. For example, the bull can only be used on people with inhuman strength and the stallion on people who have committed great sins. So there are those times, when you realize a condition is fulfilled, and you’re like, “Oh, damn, he’s going to do it!” <br />
<br />
Now, now Godou. Don’t try to take all the spotlight. The girls need a piece of the action too and luckily, they do. They don’t just sit back and pray for Godou. Nope, they fight. All of the heroines are some of the best to ever exist in the harem genre, simply because of that. It’s always a pleasure to watch both, the male lead and the heroines, provide the action. <br />
<br />
Now the romance part of Campione is just satisfying as hell. Funny thing is, if the girl is knowledgeable about the enemy god, she can transfer what she knows through a kiss. The Gods have a long history, so you know what that means ;) The kisses last a good 10, 20 seconds. If that doesn’t satisfy your need for romance, then I don’t know what will. All of the heroines know about some god that the others don’t, so don’t worry, they’re all part of this ever so pleasant romance. <br />
<br />
The show is not going to look like the inside of the Sistine Chapel, but it’s definitely good. The art should not have a negative influence on how you feel about the show. <br />
<br />
The sound isn’t exactly memorable or catchy, but it’s not that bad. Plus you can always skip it, so if you end up really not liking the opening and ending, just skip it and go on with the show. Making yourself listen to it, then calling the show mediocre because you didn’t like the opening and ending, wouldn’t be a wise nor friendly decision. Also I didn’t find any of the character’s voices to be annoying, so you shouldn’t have a problem when it comes to the sound department.<br />
<br />
The characters aren’t ones you’re going to relate to or see as well-written, but they certainly do have good character traits that led me to love all of them. Lets start with the main protagonist, Godou Kusanagi. He is a great male lead. He says he’s a pacifist, but when it comes down to it, he’s willing to kill. That is one of the greatest qualities a protagonist can have. Kind, but not the most forgiving. Watching villains get spared is pretty annoying and it’s nice that Godou understands. <br />
<br />
As for the female characters, they’re great. None of them are overly violent or annoying. Not to mention, they’re not princesses waiting to be saved. They’re knights who will protect the citizens of their country at all costs. God, isn’t that just splendid? To have girls who aren’t fragile and emotional train-wrecks. <br />
<br />
I, Zeroskye, swear on the River Styx that you will love the protagonist and surely find the bestest girl out of the heroines who just all happen to be best girls.<br />
<br />
Campione is an anime that delivers. Nice Action? Check. Awesome Protagonist? Check. Likable Heroines? Check. Romantic Progression? Check. They even decided to educate you about the entities of many different places; from Greece to Persia to Japan. Campione truly is one of the greatest ecchi harem shows to ever exist.

    Good art, extremely unemotionally bad voice acting, though the sounds of the weapons clashing do sound quite nice. super rushed anime, that&#039;s all I don&#039;t know how it goes from the man character beating a god with now powers and attaining it&#039;s powers then suddenly knowing how to use all of the powers, quite stupid really.  Story is waaaay too rushed.  And also the cheesiness is beyond logical. I mean for god sake, passing information through a kiss.  The first episode was quite good however it just went downhill, how in the world did the main heroin go from being super embarrassed

        from being seen naked and hating the man character to suddenly sleeping in his room naked and trying to seduce him? First episode hinted this could have been quite a good anime, however the way it&#039;s rushed totally ruined it big time. Don&#039;t waste your time

    Campione!<br />
I thought that i was going to enjoy Campione! only because of the ecchiness and i didn&#039;t expected this to have an elaborated story, but i was wrong, and not only with that but it&#039;s not the typical harem, the harem was well developed and it made sense the role of the girls in the anime and they were really important, because without them the protagonist couldn&#039;t be that powerful.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
Read the synopsis, and you will get the idea of what you&#039;re going to watch, the thing is that it&#039;s very well developed, is surprising and if you like mythology, name it roman, greek, persian or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195691">
        egypcian you will really enjoy and get educated from this anime and it&#039;s original that the protagonist (Godou) uses historical or mythology information to hurt and defeat his enemies and by getting this information he has to kiss the girls that knows the information so he can use his sword and along with that use the power of words, it has little flaws but overall is very good.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Sound<br />
The art style was ok, the fight animations were good, could&#039;ve been better and the sound was good in every aspect, the VA, the music, overall both were good.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
The characters were well developed, everyone had a purpose to be there and they were interesting, tho i felt the MC (Godou) could be weak if the girls didn&#039;t help him, sometimes i thought the girls were more powerful and skillful than him, specially Erica, the enemies were really interesting and i liked the fact that it didn&#039;t took him 1min. to beat them and took him more time to make a proper fight and they always ran so i always was expecting them to appear on the next episode, the chemistry was great, overall was very good.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
The romance or the kissing parts were enjoyable because you don&#039;t see kissing in harem animes, rarely this is seen because of the wuss MC on harems, here he is a little slow but at least he is not a wuss at all, the ecchiness amount was right, the fight scenes, Erica, the plot twist, the mix of everything was great, overall was a great enjoyment.

    Alright so when i watched the first episode of Campione i said to myself, i wonder where this is going. The answer i got was to sleep. For a fairly interesting concept it does very little to wow me in the ways of story or characters.<br />
<br />
I find most of the characters not very likable or even memorable so far. With the exception of one cast member i feel most are far to obnoxious,silent or superfluous to the show so far. Even character designs are lack luster and leave more to be desired. With cliche things like a shrine maiden,school boy and samurai girl i feel

          <span style="display: none;" id="review70093">
        pretty unimpressed with the cast.<br />
<br />
Back on topic with plot, it feels very minimal and just sloppy in a way. When i watch this i feel like they did not really put much effort into it. I mean the initial episode had clashes of gods but everything after was just owls and swords which is just to literal. For a character gifted with 10 god powers he uses them all very scarcely and focuses more time on impressing a shrine girl. And despite the fact he has 10 powers it still always ends in one last desperate strike to end it all a anime staple of the genre but very poorly done for this series.<br />
<br />
The art and sound are generic and not note worthy in anyway. <br />
<br />
My Enjoyment of this show is so low i find watching this to be my low point of the day and i actually put it off and pause it numerous times just cause i get bored of it so quickly. I really think this anime lacks far too much and most people will find it tasteless and without substance so i give you a 3.  A poorly done anime.

    To be frank, I had high expectations for the anime, the LN had a solid plot and was generally very enjoyable. Campione was an anime that I had looked forward to, but it has been a disappointment from the very first episode. <br />
<br />
Story: The anime is rushed, horribly rushed. Cramming an entire volume of a LN into one episode results in the confusing mess that we see in episode 1.  Understandably the animation would deviate from the LN, however the brutally mutilated storyline just makes me cringe. <br />
<br />
Art: The art was superb, everything from the detailed spell insignias in battle scenes to the character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review66411">
        art were more than satisfactory. Although not as spectacular as say &quot;Fate/Zero&quot;, there was little to find fault with in the art for Campione, the only thing I could find wrong was how derp Godou&#039;s face looks. <br />
<br />
Sound: Both the music and SFX were well done, synergizing with the tone of each scenario. <br />
<br />
Character: Yes, not everyone has been properly introduced, and it&#039;s too early to have a final verdict , but from the way things are heading, characterization is likely to be another victim of the horrible pacing of the adaptation. The rapid introduction of one heroine after another without any significant effort to develop each character as we have seen in the first two episodes is likely to continue as the anime continues at the blistering pace it has set itself.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:  The anime itself is very enjoyable and appeals to a wide range of audiences. Everything from the action and battles to the fanservice attributes to a very entertaining and fun anime to watch.<br />
<br />
Overall: Although I was disappointed with it and it could have been potentially much better, Campione is by no means &quot;bad&quot;. It is extremely fun to watch and an enjoyable experience and you will by no means regret watching it.

    &quot;She must submit to me, and act to ensure my victory!&quot;<br />
Ah, how fitting, this quote essentially sums up all of the action fight scenes.  Expect a lot of girl/guy interactions at all times, especially during the fighting scenes.  On top of that, do you like well-designed girls, magic, and an MC who isn&#039;t a enfeebled, useless, chump? In other words, if you have expressed some interest into watching this show you must be into the shounen/ecchi genres, so this review will be how adept this anime performs in being a worthy shounen/ecchi action anime.  This is a review, so I&#039;m just trying

          <span style="display: none;" id="review144929">
        to be helpful in judging whether or not you will like this show—this is some insight without any spoilers to give a hint of the overall gist of the story. <br />
===== Basic Info =====<br />
Campione! is set in modern-day and begins with a normal, somewhat lackadaisical main protagonist, Kusanagi Godou who is ignorant to all of the magic present in the world.  One day, while unknowingly delivering a precious magical artifact as an errand for his grandfather, he encounters a Great Knight, and gets caught up in the world of magic.  In an overwhelming series of events, he defeats a god using his magical artifact, and thus begins Campione!<br />
<br />
====== Characters: 7.5 ======<br />
 Kusanagi Godou<br />
He typifies the dense MC archetype, the lucky chum loved by a variety of females, and a character done many times before.  Nothing special can define him: he is your typical shounen hero who girls fawn over due to his exhibition of such a righteous sense of ethical altruism, though his character design/voice isn&#039;t unlikable unlike some other harem characters (cough*  Makoto cough*.)  He can actually be a decent character that can actually be badass, uhhhh sometimes.  The girls ostensibly think of him as someone who is very &#039;different&#039; and &#039;worthy&#039; compared to all of the other gods, and this is their basis for their feelings for him.<br />
<br />
The Girls(The good girls)<br />
Each of the girl has errrr say a realistic looking body size, bust and everything.  No abnormally flat-chested girls, or the girl with the gigantic cow udders.  This is actually a positive thing for this anime/genre.  This show, often compared to The Familiar of Zero or Shakugan no Shana actually offers a fresh set of WORTHY(not saying the Shana or Louise are bad characters at all! ) girls who all get a decent chance at the MC.  I found myself rooting for a side character I got personally attached to, not the main girl at times due to the fact that all of these girls&#039; personalities are not entirely clichéd.  Like real life, the girls have unique in the way they act towards the MC, but at the same time, they possess similar tendency and disposition in that they all, in someway, feel for the MC.  I felt like most of the girls had a real chance with the MC, which is fresh and a welcoming harem aspect, from other similar animes where the harems are so obvious that we facepalm at every new girl that interacts with the MC.  Needless to say, the interactions between the girls and the MC are quirky at times and are overall, designed fairly well.<br />
<br />
Antagonists(See second paragraph of Story Section)<br />
<br />
====== Story: 6.5 ======<br />
Straightforwardly, Campione! is an uncomplex, linear, story that typifies the bash-em-up shounen/ecchi anime with set in the premise of Greek and Roman mythology; the story may be a weaker component of this anime, but that doesn&#039;t make the anime a &#039;not watch&#039; for any reason.  The plot is driven through Kusanagi Godou and his onslaught of various gods.  As you can probably already tell, Kusanagi Godou is a God-Slayer, higher than a god (an overpowered character), so the results for each fight is practically predictable.  In almost every other episode, there is always a sense of imminent danger to the highest degree, god scaled world threatening situations where the puissant protagonist is always thrown into.  However, unlike other animes, the way that the show goes about this is . . . an edification of greek and roman god knowledge.  WAIT, what, the plot moves forward through history lessons? Yes, as implausible as this sounds, this is the defining factor in this anime, it is whoever knows more about the true identity of the deity triumphs.  As Godou learns more and more about Greek and Roman mythology, he taps into his otherworldly power.  However, the only way for him to gain this knowledge is through kissing (no joke).  Learning = kissing = power.  This is how the MC wins, every time he learns new &#039;history&#039; about Greek and Roman deities through and punishes the enemy &#039;gods&#039;, who are often &#039;messing around&#039; because they are bored.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I used to think that they were these mighty, omniscient beings. But now that I&#039;ve actually met them, gods seem more childish than anyone.&quot; —Kusanagi Godou.  This quote is in actuality, a very accurate representation for the motive behind the misbehaving of the gods(the antagonists); it displays why these gods are all antagonistic.  These gods, like children,  just want to have some fun because they are just THAT bored and carefree.  Watching gods mess around might sound interesting, but  this leads to the clichéd &#039;The world will end if we don&#039;t defeat the enemy theme&#039; in almost EVERY episode, starting from episode one. This anime is not spectacular by any means but does not fall into a pit of inferiority due to its strong cast and really catering to people who love kickass-shounen at heart.  It is an anime without a deep intricate plot.  Uncomplex and simplistic, the story revolves around how the main character literally runs around his unraveling the history of gods, which defeat the enemy, all while gathering more girls to be a part of his troupe.  Rinse and repeat this.  This archetype of an anime has been done many times before and is therefore not a high priority must watch, but is a fine-dandy anime if you find you have some desperate time to dawdle—it&#039;s solid watch for shounen/ecchi fans.<br />
<br />
===== Art: 9 ======  <br />
No squabbles here, the characters, all of them are well-drawn.  The girls are distinctly different from each other, without being too blatant.  This show does a wonderful of keeping the girls&#039; appearances realistic, avoiding the all too common geeky super smart nerdy girl with zero tits who is actually a surprisingly talented fighter, or the ironic innocent, big breasted girl who has had no experiences with males.  The anime had a decent budget, and thus the art for the time was pretty good art.  Watching the show in HD actually makes a difference as the art is fluid and natural with well-animated fight scenes.<br />
<br />
===== Sound: 8 =====<br />
Not much to comment about here.  The opening and ending are standard upbeat j-pop songs with nothing too special.  The music really sets the mood for this anime.  Other background tunes are unobtrusive and to a certain degree, somewhat enthralling, but there are no &#039;standout&#039; must listen to soundtracks.  Right off the bat, it can be easily observed that this anime will be a lighthearted ecchi/shounen flick with a developING(never fully develops) romantic subplot.  Voice acting is superb with a talented cast, no annoying characters/voices here.<br />
<br />
  ====== Enjoyment: 7.5 rounded to 8 /Final Note ======<br />
Overall, an enjoyable shounen/ecchi built on its solid cast, gorgeous girls, refined artwork, and fluid animations.  Do not expect to expect to be too immersed into a deep story here.  Watching this show is effortless; don&#039;t think too much on the simplistic plot, but indulge yourself into the other elements that were well executed.  I quite enjoyed this show due to the attractive, realistic looking characters, and their quirky interactions they had with the MC.  The ending for was quite lackluster, par at best, but there is always the completed (translated) light novel that continues the story if you are left craving for more.<br />

    Do you love tales of gods and mythology ranging from Athena the goddess of wisdom to Osiris the Egyptian god of death?<br />
Well, Campione, revolves around slaying gods and making their powers your own.<br />
Story-8<br />
It&#039;s a truly fascinating story. Kusanagi, a boy steals a gods power and continues to slay gods. However he&#039;s no ordinary god slayer. He does as he wishes and tries to avoid slaying and fighting. Instead of slaying gods for their powers, he becomes a traditional kind hero and gains support. Beside him are a priestess princess and erica, a &quot;red devil&quot;, who counter eachother&#039;s ideals and both try to make kusanagi their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review69371">
        ideal campione. <br />
Art-9<br />
The art is lovely. It has great modern 21st century art. Just looking at it makes me proud of how far the world has advanced. The battle scenes are absolutely fantastic and the background on every image makes you go woah, amazing ( well it made me say that ;P ).<br />
Sound-9 <br />
The music fits the scenes very well. For example the battle music helps you get excited and the background music helps you focus on what is happening, rather than distract you from the show and I can hear all the dialogue very clearly. The voice acting is great and lets you get into the mood. The opener and closing songs are fit the show and are quite nice.<br />
Character-9<br />
No character really pisses you off too much and the characters are not monotoned robots. They all have their own personalities. Personally I prefer heroes willing to kill but everyone has their own tastes. There is a harem which may be a little bit annoying but I personally think Godou ( the main character) deserves it as he earned them and boost the fun in the show and lightens the show up after a fight scene or whatever. I also really love the character&#039;s interactions with cute jealousy and funny humor. There also isn&#039;t that much fanservice and gets straight to the point.<br />
Enjoyment-9<br />
The series is really enjoyable if you&#039;re looking for shounen hero powns everyone show. This is one of the best in my opinion with the great art, nice plot without holes, fantastic music, fun character interactions and more.  This is shounen.<br />
Overall-9<br />
The show seems very promising but a bit rushed as many things are skipped ( I didn&#039;t read the light novel but it&#039;s quite obvious). This isn&#039;t a &quot;genius against genius&quot; show like Death note or code geass but it is an enjoyable show, very similar to bleach or naruto but god slaying instead of ninjas or shinigami. It has a few flaws but the fantastic quality makes up for it and makes this show worth watching. I personally think everyone should at least give it a shot to see whether or not you like it.

    I was highly disappointed with this anime. Being a major fan of mythology (grecque being my favourite) I had thought this would become one of my favourite animes. It has all the elements (great art, sound, characters, etc.) but in my opinion it didn&#039;t come together. Every week I feel as though I&#039;m forcing myself to keep up and continue watching (I&#039;ve watched tons of animes and this is the first time I felt that way). Perhaps it&#039;s because the story has a lot of little details and feels kind of rush...though at the same time it really doesn&#039;t go anywhere. It&#039;s definitely worth a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review72803">
        shot, but don&#039;t get your hopes to high. The biggest reason why I&#039;m still watching this is probably for the romance and since I refuse to drop an anime.

    There are a few basic conditions that you have to meet to like this anime.<br />
1. Do you like mythology? (Mostly Greek, with a little bit of Persian and Egyptian)<br />
2. Do you like harem? <br />
<br />
The first one is extremely important. The entire story revolves around mythical gods and heroes, so if you get bored from that kind of stuff or just straight out don&#039;t like it, this anime is not for you. <br />
<br />
Godou, the main character, defeats a god called Verethragna, the Oriental god of War and Victory. He takes his powers, called Authorities, and basically his job is to fight other mythological gods who threaten

          <span style="display: none;" id="review129543">
        humanity&#039;s safety, although that&#039;s not really the focal point. The overall threat is the Prophecy of the Starless Night, which says a rogue god will claim his/her powers and end the world. But being a God-Slayer and all, he naturally attracts girls and that&#039;s where the harem part comes in, but the girls play a crucial part in each of his battles, so it&#039;s not just about them falling in love with him. The plot sounds a bit cheesy, and to some extent, it is. That&#039;s why it&#039;s so important that you do enjoy stories about mythology, or else this show will bore you. <br />
But if you do love mythology like I do, you&#039;re going to love this show. The fight scenes are epic; not just the action, but the dialogue exchanged between the opponents. <br />
<br />
The art and sound are brilliant; the battle theme used is pretty incredible; search it up on Youtube if you want a listen. <br />
<br />
As far as characters go, I really liked the male harem lead since he was kind but also badass; some harem leads may be kind but they&#039;re too weak. He tries to be a pacifist, but if one of his friends is in trouble, he&#039;ll do anything to help them. <br />
The main girl, Erica Blandelli, is powerful, seductive, and intelligent. She saves Godou&#039;s life multiple times, and he definitely could not have made it far without her. She constantly professes her love to him, but he remains doubtful, and you will see why after the second episode. He doubts her, but he also says he trusts her completely, so their interaction is pretty entertaining as you try to figure out who&#039;s really in control of their relationship. <br />
<br />
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime because I have an obsession with mythology, so if you like that kind of stuff too, definitely give this a watch. If not, I&#039;d still recommend it if you like comedy and harem mixed in with epic fight scenes. <br />
<br />

    Who the heck is Athena? Perseus? Metis?<br />
<br />
Get your answer in this anime!  Nah kidding. Google it! Much as this anime about Gods, I believe you don&#039;t want to watch this anime because you want to learn more about Gods right? Unless you want to use this as an excuse to learn Greek history about Gods when you got banned by your parents and not allowed to use the internet to watch anime.<br />
<br />
Story:6/10<br />
  Ok, this story about a high-schooler, defeating a god unintentionally and became a god slayer. Well, the story is simple. He wants to lead a normal and peaceful life, not bothering

          <span style="display: none;" id="review105305">
        about Gods even though he is supposed to slay them. However, the Gods interfered with his normal and peaceful life. A few episodes each dedicated to fighting the Gods. Simple and boring plot as some might see. I mean come on! Repeating the story type of plot again and again with different characters? Boring? NO! Even though the plot is a little repetitive the action in every episode is unique and somewhat different which never fail to surprise me. Trust me, though the plot may seem a little repetitive, I dare say that it doesn&#039;t feel that way when you actually get down and watch this anime.<br />
<br />
Art:5/10<br />
  Not very desirable in my opinion for a 2012 produced anime. When I first watched it, I was like: Oh! Why haven&#039;t I seen this anime a few years back. Went to research, got mind-blown because it was a 2012 produced anime. This kind of art kind of gives people a sense of lethargy, so don&#039;t ever start the anime if you are already feeling tired because you might just be lullabied by the art of this anime. Get over the first episode and you finally get the story, you&#039;ll be fine with the rest of the episodes.<br />
<br />
Sounds:8/10<br />
  Really catchy OSTs, opening and ending. To me, when an anime has really good sounds, it&#039;s practically a sign that this anime is gonna be awesome. The OSTs just sets the audience into the right mood. Battle-type OST, you&#039;ll be prepared that a epic battle is about to happen. Escape-type OST, you&#039;ll know that there will be an epic escape from people. Beautiful opening: Brave blade by Megu Sakuragawa. Really catchy and allows me to get into this anime.<br />
<br />
Character:8/10<br />
  The characters are all quite funny, especially Erica,who enjoys teasing Godou. And not to mention when Godou responds to her teasing. However funny the characters may be, there is a serious side to them. The serious side    to them is when they get really frustrated and determined to do something, becoming a over-powering hero.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:8/10<br />
  Really enjoyed this anime because it is action-driven anime. I love action animes. Kind of gets you to the chuunibyou mood. On top of that, I actually get to learn more about Gods! Warning: Beware not to watch the 2nd last episode of the anime in front of your parents. You have been warned! <br />
<br />
If you haven&#039;t watch this anime, go watch it. I&#039;m almost 75% sure you&#039;ll enjoy this anime. Thank you.

    &quot;Somewhere in an alternate universe, Gilgamesh has a black hair, he&#039;s a highschooler and he has his own harem. He also secretly learnt Unlimited Blade Works. But most importantly, he is also a god-slayer. The king of kings. The glorious title given to whom had successfully slain a god.&quot; <br />
<br />
The quote above pretty much summarizes the entire anime. This anime is an alternate universe of the Fate series. Gilgamesh goes around and kiss girls in order to beat gods. That&#039;s pretty much it.<br />
<br />
All jokes aside, this anime was pretty awesome and probably one of the anime where &quot;Ecchi&quot; and &quot;Harem&quot; seem acceptable. It was just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345621">
        so fun to watch. I had a great time with it. I feel content. <br />
<br />
A pretty amusing anime overall. Only animation and art style requires a little work so it could display the fight scenes better. Other than that I have nothing else to say. <br />
<br />
Recommended to everybody especially Fate fans. <br />

    Its a good fun anime.<br />
<br />
The anime team did a wonderful job in creating beautiful and cool characters which for a fan like me a very important aspect in a series. all the female characters has a wonderful sex appeal and unique talent. a great start to create a &quot;harem&quot; environment. <br />
<br />
The action and fighting sequence are exciting and I especially love the golden swords(thousands of swords attacking the villain) attack..its really...cool. the author seems to put a lot of afford and research into myths and gods which is very creative and somewhat informative to the viewers. <br />
<br />
The romantic aspect between the characters is quite cute

          <span style="display: none;" id="review158417">
        but I think that the producer might have rushed to crammed the scene together(perhaps because of the limited episodes allocated to the series) I think if the producer were given a second season or more episodes to play with maybe the series can be better plan and stronger and more interesting plot can be added in.<br />
<br />
(in my opinion 12 episode is very short to tell a story)<br />
<br />
 I find that the storyline and characters are still interesting and the artworks for this anime is beautiful<br />
<br />
worth watching<br />
<br />
my favourite character is the sexy erica <br />
<br />
(somehow I feel like i&#039;m a fan of the AC MILAN football club)

    When a god is slain , the slayer inherits its powers .<br />
<br />
Campione is a unique anime which appeals to its audiences by how it portrays its scenes and its extraordinary &quot; vivid details &quot; . Campione is also a very original anime which brings a whole new experience to us viewers .<br />
<br />
The story<br />
Campione is a story where a sixteen year old boy who got into an adventure and ended up slaying one of the heretic gods , Verethragna . Thus he became the 7th and the youngest campione , and he have to stop other troublesome gods alongside with his companions . Campione set itself

          <span style="display: none;" id="review105837">
        in a supernatural theme and it succeeded in combining different elements along its progression . The plot was superb and it gives viewers a whole new experience .However every anime has its flaws , pushing the positive factors aside , the series really felt rushed and they left out lots of background information . This sometimes causes me to wonder if I have missed an episode . Especially during the last arc , when they tried to squeeze everything in just 2 episodes . I&#039;d rather wait for a 2nd season . Nevertheless the story never failed to make me crave for the next episode<br />
<br />
Art<br />
The character design was average and it was too generic .However the action scenes was spectacular in particular the part where Godou had to fight against sasha voban . Whereas some scenes were so intensely portrayed that it became rather disturbing - &quot;ahem&quot; . But these made campione such an unique anime compared to other typical animes<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The series make excellent use of its soundtracks . It was fabulously presented . The action scenes were definitely more intense . At the same time , they managed to balance out between light-hearted moments and serious action scenes . The opening song Brave Blade was average .<br />
The seiyuu cast was top notch , it can be seen that they had put in their upmost effort and they deserved to be praised . Their voices  fit their roles perfectly and it highlights their personalities even more . I definitely have to mention Yo-shit-sugu matsuoka who did a great job in voicing Godou.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
The characters in Campione have their own unique personalities . However it was not fully developed and this causes the anime to go downhill as it progresses . <br />
<br />
Godou Kusanagi - the main protagonist of this series . He has a personality that makes him shine as a main character . Godou has often shown very oxymoronic and self contradictory behaviour . For e.g he is a shy young man but yet he is a natural lady-killer . He is also a self-proclaimed pacifist and will fight only when needed . However nothing about his history was mentioned , thus we do not know anything beyond his current self . <br />
<br />
Erica Blandelli - the main female protagonist of the series . She is a courageous woman who feels no shame in declaring her love for Godou to everyone else . She is also passionate and strong willed . She too , lacked development and it is clearly seen in the drastic change of feelings towards Godou in merely one episode. It really felt extremely rushed .<br />
<br />
Yuri Mariya - the second main female protagonist . She is very shy and normally speaks politely . And the scary thing is that when she gets angry , it&#039;s hard to distinguish if she&#039;s speaking politely or she&#039;s angry . Even though the series slightly touched on her past , it was merely the tip of an iceberg and we still don&#039;t know anything more than simply just a maiden who was involved in a ritual and now falls in love with Godou . <br />
<br />
Liliana kranjcar - the third main female protagonist of the series . She is a beautiful , slender girl who has a serious and knight-like personality . Because of her personality , she is often made fun of by Erica and the rest . She also tends to hide her feelings for Godou ,which is the exact opposite of Erica . <br />
<br />
Last but not least , Ena seishuuin . The last main female protagonist of the series . She has a very strange personality that she seems relaxed about the things in the modern world<br />
but still has a slight naiveté in her . She acts on her instinct and impulse , rather than her wits . I personally do not think that her existence was necessary and I rather the producers to use the time to focus more on the other characters&#039; development . It felt so &quot; forced&quot; as  her appearance did not really contribute to the plot at all .<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
Overall , this series was surprisingly pleasurable to watch . The good parts made up for the flaws that series has . Even though there is a lot of ecchi-ness and fan service , but it overall maintains its themes well , also without shifting away from its original focus. However it&#039;s painful to watch a MC who does not realised that the girls around him have fallen in love with him . :3<br />

                          The ancient gods of myth and legend, whether it be Athena the goddess of Wisdom, or heroes like Perseus, we humans thought that world to be outside of our realm. We saw the gods as untouchable, immortal, all powerful beings, yet those who overcome that barrier earn the title known as Campione, or God-Slayer. <br />
<br />
Campione! : Matsurowanu Kamigami to Kamigoroshi no Maou, phew, I&#039;m outta breath, for future reference, I&#039;m going to shorten it to Campione. Campione focuses an a young high school

          <span style="display: none;" id="review105161">
        boy by the name of Kusanagi, Godou. Godou, on a trip to deliver an old stone tablet for his grandfather (whom is never revealed) is suddenly and accidentally thrust into a world he previously thought didn&#039;t exist. With the help of the Italian, Bronze Black Cross knight, Erica Blandelli, they manage to slay their first god, which turns Godou into a Campione. The title of Campione can have many benefits and many downsides. Those negative effects may be the attraction of organizations who want them for their own purposes, or the positives of women flocking around him. Godou must survive the interactions of gods coming to earth and a prophecy that foretells to destroy the world. Of course, he can&#039;t do this without hot, sexy knights by his side. <br />
<br />
To startoff, the anime Campione may have been ecchi based to start off, seeing as though there is two different types of ecchi included. Quoting my friend Milanvde, Showoff and Romance, examples of these types can be seen as; The anime KissxSis is a Showoff anime, pushing the borders of anime and hentai, whereas Romance can be seen as an attempt of showing some skin in the character&#039;s attempts at a romantic relationship. Campione, unlike KissxSis isn&#039;t entirely about showing off, yet focuses more on an overall plot line while including some nice fan service from time to time. <br />
<br />
The story: The story was a nice balance of the standard harem / high school story lines, and the other side of a shounen, god-slayer, foreboding prophecy type of storyline. The unique part of Campione for me would be the inclusion of gods in the anime, which led to the addition of the Campiones (sounds a lot like champions, doesn&#039;t it?). Using their god powers or authorities that they received from killing their respective gods, the fights in Campione can be very exciting and cool. Not only stopping at the powers from almighty gods, Campione included magic which is controlled mainly by organizations around the Campione. Campione unfortunately cannot use magic and cannot be effected by it, unless through a kiss, which brings about the ecchi based part of the anime. The producers definitely did a nice job of not having an overbearing presence of the common day to day harem style and kept their own originality through the world of myth and legend. A big plus IMO. The ecchi was tastefully included, and the main plot line following the prophecy that is told by a princess (whom is also never revealed) isn&#039;t that bad either. The plot line never felt rushed to me, and the introduction of each harem girl wasn&#039;t that bad, in fact it was done in some original ways that stayed true to the main theme of Campione!. Overall, the Story, the biggest focus of Campione! is very well done, and provides a nice balance between the ecchi, the common harem outline, and the world of God&#039;s from Greek mythology.<br />
<br />
The Art and Sound: The art and sound I&#039;ve never had to complain about from an anime. That being said I think that the animations of the characters were done very nicely, not too sharp and focused that it can be considered high quality graphics, like Guilty Crown, but not too smooth to be considered for a romantic anime. This can be said in other words, also contributing the amount of talented balance this anime had. It not only balanced the story quite well, but also the quality of the drawings. The sound complimented the scenes in the anime well, it wasn&#039;t too over the top, but also provided the extra cherries on the top, when needed. These topics were both well done. <br />
<br />
Characters: The characters were pretty standard, being that this anime is also harem themed. One can see the common inclusion of the Tsundere, the slighty Yandere, the lolicon, the shy type, and the just overall unusual submissive type. The main character however was a little different, to my surprise. In common harem themed anime, he didn&#039;t fall under the type that had to be protected by his girls, he didn&#039;t fall under the type to be the kind-hearted saviour either. If I were to put an example that is close to Kusanagi Godou, it would be... Teppei Arima from the Princess Lover! series, I liked both series very much mainly because of how the main character steps outside the box from common main characters and sets themselves apart from the latter. The characters IMO were introduced nicely and the relationships between them didn&#039;t seemed rushed at all. Although in some parts of the anime (you&#039;ll understand near the end of Campione!) when the relationship got serious, I wish they just went through with  it instead of creating an awkward cliche scene... I mean come on, nobody would have complained if they went all the way.<br />
(SPOILER ALERT- &quot;I&#039;m going to inject you with my divine protection!&quot; XD WTF.)<br />
 Overall, a good job, and I thoroughly enjoyed Campione!.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: As I said above, Campione! has to be one of my favorite anime with ecchi in it so far, rivaling IS: Infinite Stratos, I also sincerely hope a second season is released because of some unanswered questions I have, and the continuation of this unique style. <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading, <br />

    This anime seems to have the curse that afflicts many anime these days, the curse of having lots of potential and then failing to utilize it.<br />
<br />
When watching Campione you&#039;re going to realize the the people staffed to work this anime had two conflicting groups with different goals. One group had a pretty cool story idea they wanted to make, the other group wanted to make a really well animated hentai. These two groups had to share a budget and share characters, and thus we get Campione.<br />
<br />
The story was a really interesting idea with compelling characters and unique style in many ways, but it was bogged

          <span style="display: none;" id="review101993">
        down with I&#039;m assuming a small budget, not enough time, and the fact that a lot of people wanted this to be hentai. Seriously, there are several times you&#039;ll think, why didn&#039;t they just make it a mature rating and go a little further? Near the end you&#039;ll see a scene that will make no sense, and then it will click and you&#039;ll understand all the heavy handed symbolism they&#039;re using and be rife with confusion about it. I won&#039;t put any spoilers here, but episode 12 something happens, and when you realize what they&#039;re trying to get across to you it will confuse you to no end why they did it the way they did.<br />
<br />
While there is plenty to complain about, the characters are each entertaining and developed, the art is beautiful, and the music is very enjoyable. This anime could have been a lot better but it&#039;s not, it&#039;s simply good, not great.

    Campione! is an unfortunate anime.<br />
<br />
The set up is cool, at least for the harem genre - random guy kills a diety and inherits his powers, which causes him to fight other deities and attract various pretty girls during his adventures who compete for his affections.  And if you bother to read the light novels (there are over fifteen of them I think), the story and characters are pretty good for the most part. <br />
<br />
But Campione! in its desire to hit the apparently required minimum harem four-girl threshold by the end of the series decides to cover way too much material in too short of

        time.  It feels rushed from the beginning, making every development with the female characters feel even more unbelievable than normal for this type of anime.  It also makes the misstep of taking the story chronologically instead of following the storyline in the books.<br />
<br />
Finally, for those of us that watch dubs, the voice acting in this one is bad.  The voice actress for Erica is terribly miscast.  <br />
<br />
Art is good, not great. <br />
<br />
Overall this anime could be a lot better if the anime staff had put more faith into the underlying source material rather than making a checklist and forcing too much into too little space.  Do yourself a favor if you are thinking about this series.  First read the light novels (you can find them online).  Then check out the series so you&#039;ll be able to fill in the gaps in your head.  <br />
<br />
Hopefully, another studio will take a crack at this one after the light novel series puts out a bunch more volumes in another few years.  There is a lot of potential with the source material.  But I doubt the anime made enough of an impact to get another season green-lit.

    Updated 10/3/12<br />
<br />
Well, this year was my first year back at major anime watching in a long time. I started up again this spring, and I&#039;ve got to say, it&#039;s either me-- or anime got super ecchi. <br />
<br />
Everyone has their own standards as to what floats his/her boat, and I can openly say that this anime did pretty well.<br />
<br />
Story- 7<br />
UPDATE: I&#039;ve finished the series. My expectations weren&#039;t off at all considering that I watched every episode, except for 13, while it was still airing. The ending was meh, but what could I have expected. But the same can go for a majority of the previous season&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review72973">
        anime (Hagure no Yuusha Ecstetica, Dakara  Boku Wa H Ga Denkai). Wait-- not only last season&#039;s, but it can apply for a lot of recent day animes. If I did not come back and watch anime, I would have been REALLY bothered by the ending. However, I did come back to watching anime this year-- and was disappointed by numerous endings. Luckily I got used to the bleh endings after watching a few bleh endings.<br />
<br />
Our main protagonist, Kusanagi Godou is a campione-- a god slayer.A campione has his/her set of special abilities called authorities. The campione&#039;s abilities come from a god that one has slayed. I can openly say that this is very original. At the moment, I can&#039;t think of any anime/manga that mimics or comes close to the ideas in this anime/novel. <br />
<br />
Not much background is given about life before the series, given that this is a 13 episode anime. Although it is a harem, it&#039;s not all about the ecchi related things. Everything did flow, but maybe everything flowed too fast. Godou does get stronger indeed, but how is the question. Besides the fact that he has 4 knights/women standing beside him, doesn&#039;t change the fact that he gets stronger in a flash. I know that he does get stronger through acquiring the knowledge of/about the gods, but that doesn&#039;t explain how he learns how to fight and uses Verethragna&#039;s authorities. Otherwise everything flowed very smoothly. Considering that it&#039;s 13 episodes long, I can&#039;t expect this anime to go out in a BANG. It might be left open for a second season, or it might be altered story-wise (like some anime-- Pandora Hearts to just give an example). <br />
<br />
There was a lot missing from the anime that was in the novel, and if the studio would have chosen to put those parts in, I personally thought it would have been a lot better. Instead of a really rushed, mundane 11-13 episode anime-- it could have been so much more. Just an opinion, as is this review.<br />
<br />
Art:10<br />
They did great with the animation and artwork. They didn&#039;t cut corners in any of the 12 episodes so far. Everything was VERY detailed. I have personally gone to Italy, and I can say that they did a good job of portraying Italy. The scene where Godou first encounters Perseus was a place where I went, and they did a good job of putting it in. The train station from the 1st episode could have actually looked like that in real life, but with more people.<br />
<br />
Sound:9<br />
I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s just me, but I didn&#039;t hear that many catchy tracks. They did a good job here, too. The seiyuu did splendid jobs (spare me episode 12). ANYWAYS, there wasn&#039;t anything that bothered me at all. Everything sounded as it should have.<br />
<br />
Character: 10-&gt;9<br />
<br />
Update:<br />
<br />
I do believe that the characters did have SOME time to develop/show more character. Erica was pretty much the same from beginning to end (considering that she was somewhat of a tsundere, opening up to Goudo when she found out he was a campione). I really thought that Ena could have had more screen time/character development. However, I guess this all can also be attributed to the fact that it was 13 episodes long.<br />
<br />
I think I&#039;ll be able to remember these characters in a few years time. Godou isn&#039;t a weak lead in this harem. He&#039;s actually just right in the middle. Not too strong, and not too weak. Godou isn&#039;t oblivious (if I remember correctly), and he isn&#039;t over confident either. He&#039;s what I&#039;d call a homeostatic lead. Not extreme in any way. Liliana and Erica are the 2 more memorable of the 4 in Godou&#039;s harem, primarily due to more screen time is what I think. Erica is probably the most horny yet elegant female lead. Yeah, an oxymoron right there... Liliana, although she somewhat follows the norm of a shy girl, doesn&#039;t follow the norm at the same time. She eventually opens up and openly shows her feelings for her king. Ena is very lax. Not something you find everyday in a harem. Her personality is a bit different. She&#039;s laid back, but at the same time she likes Godou. She was introduced rather spontaneously, so I guess that&#039;s why she seems different. Yuri is closest to the visual novel norm... the shy innocent girl. Not a bad thing FOR ME, but not a good thing either. Even though she was introduced early on, and was shown throughout the series, I had the most trouble remembering her. And then comes Athena. She&#039;s not an &quot;official&quot; member of Kusanagi&#039;s harem, but she is a part of it. Unique to her is the way she joined it. She started off as an antagonist and became an unclear character later on, although it can be assumed she is on Godou&#039;s side. <br />
Overall, I think these are the most memorable characters of Summer 2012. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment and Overall: 10<br />
<br />
Update: Overall it stayed the same. I am used to seeing the cliffhanger/bad/so-so endings, so the 13th episode did not really subtract from anything.<br />
<br />
I thought this to be one of the best, if not the best of Summer 2012, and *maybe* this year for me. Godou was unique in that he was close to normal. He and Issei are my favorite leads of this year, and possibly of all that I have watched. The 1st episode reeled me in. I&#039;ve seen tons of anime with spirits, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve seen any with mythical gods. The story is great so far for 12/13 episodes done. I&#039;m almost positive that this is the best of Summer 2012. <br />
<br />
When I&#039;ve completed the series, I&#039;ll update the review and give it my final thoughts.<br />
<br />
Done with the updates!<br />
<br />

    Story:  A fairly decent story line that i say for only 13 episodes is well developed, or as well as it could be developed over that short period of time, kind of the classic harem story where a normal kid gets tons of money or power then all of these girls just want his D 24/7 which i can totally go for. So after meeting Erica and slaying his first God, thats pretty much how his life is.<br />
<br />
Art: Great art that i found was just like most recent animes with very good background as well as character details. Ecchi scenes were drawn pretty well,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review102529">
        especially the parts where they share knowledge about gods through the magic of shoving their tongues down the MC&#039;s throat. Which evidently, you must wonder why thats not the only way girls can pass information. Fanservice too good.<br />
<br />
Sound: Just normal sound for a recent anime (it was made in 2012) so nothing too special, good voice acting.<br />
<br />
Character: Character development was actually very good for the short amount of time that they had, and the actual characters were fairly like-able, personality and actions.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I really enjoyed pretty much everything in this anime, there was pretty much nothing wrong with it, being that its the only anime that I&#039;ve seen so far( i haven&#039;t watched many) that i was truthfully give a 10 to. Which of course i did. <br />
