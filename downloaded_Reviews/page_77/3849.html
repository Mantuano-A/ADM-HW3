    [NOTICE: I actually love alternative rock music, this review is not a statement against the genre itself, but the bafflingly awful and musically flawed nature of this specific anime. In short, I like this kind of music, but the songs here are objectively bad]<br />

                            - you still want to believe in the goodness of music<br />
<br />
My personal opnion:<br />
A music anime where the lead somehow fails to hit every single note in every single song, completely ignores the bpm most of the time and is still considered to be a godsent singing wonder is beyond dreadful. And even if you had complete tone-deafness or the goodwill towards anime temporarily impaired your hearing, you&#039;d still be left with the painfully generic, gloomy teenage romance plot between two flavors of generic tsundere boys: the adorably irate pipsqueak (the M for the yaoi fanfiction) and the sexy serial killer that blushes (the S for the yaoi fanfiction) and the subject of their passive-aggressive uncaring-caring: a walking-talking migraine stuck in a girl&#039;s body.<br />
Though, to be fair, this entire series is pretty much a migraine in animated form...<br />
<br />
So in short:<br />
- uninspired and grating story<br />
- constant melodrama<br />
- tiring and annoying characters<br />
- music comprised solely of off-beat, false notes<br />
- not entertaining even in an ironic way<br />
<br />
This anime is simply an unpleasant experience that takes a lot out of you with every second spent watching it.

    Melodrama has been the talk of the anime community for quite a while now. Most of the time that I see it being mentioned, it&#039;s in a negative light. As an example &quot;teenage melodrama&quot; has become one of the most commonly used terms when discussing shows like Anohana, Angel Beats, Your Lie In April and many others that set their sights at making the viewer cry by the end of it. The characters are often overblown and stereotyped for the sake of achieving that goal, as you can see in the previously mentioned examples. That&#039;s pretty much the gist of it: create simple, recognizable characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251218">
        that the viewer can quickly empathize with just so you can use that to play with their emotions.<br />
I&#039;ve often been an advocate for melodrama. I&#039;ve always thought that it created a specific kind of feeling that I grew rather fond of. Most of the time it&#039;s almost as if the characters inside such stories live in a world that&#039;s created for the purpose of melodrama alone, it tends to feel almost like a theatrical play. It&#039;s charming, almost hypnotizing, and if the show can build off of it properly it can achieve some stupendous results.<br />
Enter Anonymous Noise (Fukumenkei Noise), created by studio Brain&#039;s Base who&#039;s been in sort of a commercial slump over the past few years despite having some of the most beloved franchises under their belt. Was this an attempt at making their way back into the market?<br />
Certainly not.<br />
Fukumenkei Noise almost feels like a fan project and at times it even looks like one! There&#039;s so much wrong with it that it almost feels like it was created by an amateur, but it wasn&#039;t! People who made this have a few projects under their belts, maybe not enough to be called &quot;experienced&quot;, but they surely had to have some knowledge about the industry. So how did it came to this? How did someone look at all of it and thought &quot;yes, this will sell&quot;. Add some pretty weird restrictions on the countries that it was allowed to air in (UK, Ireland, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland only on Crunchyroll, rest is only available on Amazon Anime Strike) and you got yourself a huge, incredibly obvious flop, and let me tell you, I certainly won&#039;t be advocating for this one.<br />
<br />
*Slight spoilers included*<br />
<br />
The show features a love triangle between the three main characters. Nino, also known as Alice, is a girl who got into singing at a young age thanks to singing &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&quot; with Momo, her male neighbor who later had to leave for certain reasons. During that time she also met Yuzu, a boy who liked to write music that she would meet on the beach. After Momo leaves, he helps her get out of a slump by leaving her a song that she can sing. With the intention of reaching Momo with her voice, Alice keeps singing, and when she enrolls into a new school it turns out that Yuzu is in her class, what&#039;s more is that Momo attends it too, though in another building. And so the tale of music and love begins.<br />
Gosh, it was so hard to make this show sound remotely interesting.<br />
<br />
Anonymous Noise has problems since the very beginning, as it decides to start off with the older characters, but then immediately jumps back to a flashback for the entirety of the second episode to showcase their backstories. Wouldn&#039;t the first episode be more effective if we knew those characters since childhood? Seeing them reunite has no meaning, no impact if we don&#039;t know who they are. Those characters mean nothing to us. The only thing it does is raise confusion. To be honest it would be fine if the second episode didn&#039;t exist, because the show does a good enough job at telling their backstory through their actions and dialogue, but it has no meaning when we already know it all and just serves as a constant reminder instead of pushing the plot in any direction. It&#039;s as if the writer didn&#039;t trust his viewers to follow their story both in childhood and in the present at the same time, so he just put that episode in post-production to make it less confusing as it goes on. That&#039;s not a good thing to assume. But that&#039;s only the beginning of the downward spiral.<br />
I think that describes this show perfectly. &quot;Downward&#039; because this show keeps going lower and lower with its quality the more it goes on, and &quot;Spiral&#039; because while doing so, it only spins around in place without even realizing that it&#039;s heading to its demise.<br />
Alice is obsessed with Momo. I&#039;m not talking &quot;oh, they&#039;re just in love&quot;, I&#039;m talking actually obsessed. For six years she kept on thinking about him, not letting go of her dream to meet him and be together once more. The entire time we follow the group, everything she does, she does for Momo, for a chance of seeing Momo, for even a bit of news about Momo. She joins a band in order to reach Momo with her voice, as she promised him six years ago, she learns how to play guitar because the guitar came from Momo, she started writing a song because it was going to be about Momo. This is a trait that could certainly be intriguing, if only the show could step back from it when Alice is on the screen. At one point, she pretty much becomes a psychopath, she can&#039;t function without him, when she gets on stage all she can think about is something related to her precious Momo, she turns berserk while singing exactly because of that. It gets really boring after a while, seeing how much did Nino go through to, in the end, remain with the exact same feeling and with the exact same mindset, because trust me, there are so many events that should influence her that it&#039;s crazy. If that wasn&#039;t enough she repeated the name of her beloved so much that it even made me realize how silly it is. Who in the world would name their son Momo (No offense to all the Momo&#039;s out there, but it is silly)? Doesn&#039;t Momo sound like a name for a pet monkey?<br />
Actually, he pretty much is the pet monkey that belongs to this show. What he really is, is a Deus Ex Machina that tries to hide it by having a resemblance of some sort of a personality. He exists solely to have an impact on others, to push them forward alongside the plot. His own motivations are unclear and tangled like some sort of a pasta dish, but one that&#039;s from a cheap, crappy restaurant that doesn&#039;t even have a proper sign on the street. He wants to stay with Alice, but he &quot;can&#039;t&quot; because he clearly wouldn&#039;t be able to compose music anymore. Why even try right? It&#039;s better to live a life of misery that you&#039;re living right now without doing so, right? You know, when you have a different character that can clearly think and recognize stuff, especially when he spends so much time with a character that&#039;s this much in the clouds, having all other characters act so much out of the ordinary that he sets can be obnoxious. That character is Yuzu.<br />
Yuzu has a proper development cycle and actually evolves throughout the show accordingly to the things that are happening to him. He has different approaches to Alice as she becomes more and more psychopathic and relentless, he wants to help her, but he keeps getting blocked out. The worst part, is that the guy who is his rival turned out to be his friend. What a coincidence! Even he ends up getting completely screwed by Momo. It&#039;s like Momo only exists to screw over other characters! It&#039;s like everything would go correct for them if it wasn&#039;t for Momo appearing at random moments!<br />
Does this add something to the actual value of the show? Does anything add to the actual value of the show? No. This show is so lifeless and forced that it almost chokes and drowns in its own vomit.<br />
This show fails to use anything it has at its disposal, and that&#039;s funny because, you know, it could&#039;ve chosen what it had at its disposal in the first place.<br />
A) Melodrama? The scenes where it&#039;s utilized the most are inefficient because of the lazy camera work and animation, pretty much every single one of them has this one, long still shot that&#039;s just plain boring, no matter how impactful it should be. Not to mention that the melodrama is overused to all living hell and repetitive at that. For example, in one of the earlier episodes, three different characters end a conversation by slamming the door. All of them are different people, two of which didn&#039;t seem to overblow their emotions as much as they did at that moment. At that point, not only do you ruin you characters with inconsistencies, but the usually strong, effective scenes become less impressive when you have four or five grand, overblown moments before it already.<br />
B) Music? The MC never shows her actual passion for music, the only thing that seems to push her into it is Momo, for Yuzu it&#039;s the fact that he writes for Alice, though it is said that his mother forced him not to pursue anything related to music and he finds peace and transcribed his feelings through it, so he&#039;s good in my book, and last, for Momo it&#039;s that he needs money and also because of Nino. So if two out of three of them seem to have no passion, how about the secondary cast? Well, they seem to enjoy it, but just like anybody else, nobody ever talks about how they like music, why they like music and why do they do music. They just created a band because they were at a concert..... cool. Even the manager, as he talks about the songs they create, he talks about this being good and this being bad, but what makes him decide that? I sure as hell don&#039;t hear any difference. Oh wait, I forgot that once he said that Nino lacks &quot;something&quot;. Thanks for the info buddy. Very useful.<br />
C) Love? There is no real reason for Alice to keep on loving Momo for such a long time, nor is there one for Momo to never forget her, maybe it was a turning point in his life or something, but from what we know, there were other instances that could ignite this, multiple ones in fact. Yuzu has the only reasonable explanation out of the three, it&#039;s that even though he always remembered her as the first person who was so passionate about his songs and someone that he helped, plus the fact that she&#039;s the reason why he lost his voice drove him somewhat insane over her, his love was only rekindled after he met her six years after. Once again, I don&#039;t know whose idea was it to pair one character, that has pretty reasonable explanations for his actions and development that corresponds with the events of the show, with all the others to make them look like some brainless teens who seem to live on another planet, but by doing so it made it pretty much impossible to push the suspension of disbelief more than to a certain point. The only justification is that they&#039;re stupid.<br />
<br />
And you know what? Despite that, I think I could&#039;ve liked this show. I mean, last winter, Kuzu No Honkai came out and everyone was an idiot in there too. What that show had, is some clever directing that kept me coming back to it, it made me want to think about what it had to offer, and it also had some good character designs and solid music. Well, that show also had more themes and more exploration, but that&#039;s not my point. But you know what? For a show that&#039;s supposed to showcase going completely crazy through singing, for a show that has so many &quot;important&quot; moments, this show is absolutely atrocious in all technical aspects.<br />
You know how to notice a quality of a music anime straight away? With the music! Surprising, I know.<br />
When your entire series, your premise, your core and your heart is based around the meaning and portraying yourself through music, having the characters not care for it is one thing, but having zero FUCKING passion for your soundtrack is a disgrace. I am so mad at this series with how it treats its music. Let&#039;s even go past the fact the directing for the music has no meaning, the tracks themselves are lazy. There&#039;s about four different variations of the same song, don&#039;t worry though, it&#039;s not like they&#039;re associated to any type of scene other than &quot;sad&quot; or &quot;happy&quot;. Not only that, but that song, that one constantly repeated track, is the OP. Yup. That&#039;s how little effort was put into it. Just take the opening, add some different mixer to it and throw it out there. I&#039;m sure nobody will notice. Do you know how exasperating it is to hear the same song over and over again? There were points where I was relieved to hear a song that isn&#039;t a remixed opening. I was relieved to hear any form of freshness in the soundtrack of a music show. Let that sink in for a while.<br />
The other tracks are somewhat okay, but they&#039;re not anything good either, they aren&#039;t pleasing to listen to for me, they don&#039;t feel like they&#039;re conveying anything, and since the show doesn&#039;t give a damn about how to use them, I feel even less inclined to even give them a chance.<br />
The visuals are just as dull, perhaps even more, but they aren&#039;t infuriating, because this isn&#039;t a show about visuals, they&#039;re just disappointing. The character designs say nothing about them, so instead they try to fit some jokes around how long Yuzu&#039;s eyelashes are or how small he is, other characters though, not so much. Nice try by putting yet another thing into JUST ONE CHARACTER YOU IDIOTS. The other visuals, aren&#039;t half bad, the backgrounds look solid and there were some nice scenes throughout the show, especially the beach which was a highlight of the show for me every time there was a sunset. Let&#039;s get back to negatives though, this show has absolutely no idea what is it doing with it&#039;s setting. It just throws in places, you have no idea how do they connect, it lacks a proper sense of direction in every place. They just jump around between places like it&#039;s nothing. Nino enters a building to go to a studio, next scene she&#039;s next to the place she&#039;s supposed to be in and you have no clue whether she had to walk up, down, just through a door, was it a long distance or whatever, nothing. There are even scenes in other parts of that building, but I have no idea where could those ones be placed either. They spend a lot of time in the studio, just like in some other locations like the beach and the school, but if I were to move around any of those locations based on the show alone, I would get lost in a matter of seconds. Oh, and let&#039;s not forget that absolutely &quot;teen-like&quot; sense of fashion. The casual clothes are so &quot;rock&quot; and &quot;punk&quot;, and the costumes that the band plays in are so &quot;dark&quot;, that&#039;s what makes them cool, I mean we all know darkness is what teens are into. I honestly don&#039;t know how do teens in Japan think or what is the current popular style, but I hope it has nothing to do with this. Same goes for the hairstyles. They&#039;re weird, unlike anything I&#039;ve ever seen before, especially Nino with the two balls on each top side of her head. She almost looks like an alien when she has those.<br />
And then there&#039;s the directing. Oh dear lord. I&#039;ll just go out and say it, but you better prepare yourself for the next sentence. Almost all important scenes are either done in CGI or with a still shot.<br />
I can&#039;t take it no more! Writing this one sentence filled me with so much despair that you can&#039;t even imagine, it&#039;s so painful even thinking about how much could they ruin each and every scene with awful, despicable directing hurts me internally. I feel genuinely angry.<br />
Sure, there&#039;s animation after the still shot goes away, but it all looks the same: There&#039;s a dramatic scene incoming, sudden transition into a still shot and a sparkly or serious sound plays. Yuzu kisses Nino = still shot. Yuzu sees Nino smile when she is learning to play the guitar = still shot. Momo says goodbye to Nino = still shot. <br />
The CGI is used for the concerts, where Alice goes berserk and people witness the power of her voice. That&#039;s not bad on its own. What is bad, is that all it does is puts the character models on repeat. They have a cycle of movement. Also, Alice&#039;s hair when she has the wig on jump around as if they were two springs. Fuck this. I&#039;m sorry, but I&#039;m genuinely mad when there&#039;s so little effort put into a project that some author worked on for hours upon hour. Even if I dislike the way he wrote it, it still doesn&#039;t deserve this. This is a disgrace to him, I&#039;m sure that when he wrote those concert scenes, he wanted them to embody what his story can do, but here comes a studio that took everything he did, and through the things that were completely out of his control, wrecked those scenes, as if the repetitive music wasn&#039;t enough. The people who made this are actual scumbags and I feel no remorse calling them that.<br />
<br />
Whooo, okay, let me calm down a bit. This is going to be a section where I ramble about some other details that I left out, AKA the Super Spoiler Section.<br />
You know how else was the love theme butchered? There were two other relationships that I didn&#039;t mention, one between that blonde kid Haruno and Suguri, and the other one between her and Yuzu. But where do those go? Absolutely nowhere, not even a bit, not even a tiniest little inch. There are about two or three scenes that indicate the love interested between them, and they never are brought up again. It&#039;s like the writer felt as if there weren&#039;t enough romance sub-plots, as there are in other shows, and had to put it in for the sake of it. There&#039;s nothing to them, the characters that they try to do something with end up being nothing anyway.<br />
Yeah, I didn&#039;t even mention the side characters before because they are nothing, and yet the author tried to make two of them into something with such little effort and care. They don&#039;t have any resemblance of a personality outside one quirk, like the drummer who is always straightforward, or the two lovebirds that I mentioned, but they try to make Nino interact with them and have some sort of meaning to her. Like the girl vocalist, who later leaves to join Momo&#039;s band becomes her friend, but her relationship means nothing to either of them in the end. It&#039;s like they just needed another female character for Nino to talk about certain topics with. She has nothing to offer. And same goes for the blonde guy, who says things, but he is never established to any degree. And the drummer boy? He&#039;s practically nonexistent, the only time he has something to say is when he goes for the same joke of &quot;I&quot;m really straightforward&quot;, so if you see him doing anything, that means it&#039;s coming sooner or later. There&#039;s also the manager who likes to not give any details on his work and do nothing while trying to feel important. That&#039;s not his character description, that&#039;s just how I see him upon finishing the show.<br />
Speaking of finishing this show, it certainly was rushed. The whole sub-plot about Yuzu&#039;s and Momo&#039;s mothers? Yeah, there were maybe three scenes for each, both ended as abruptly and added drama that only served as, well, more drama. The characters work perfectly fine without it, it only adds more scenes that, you know, could be used to add some stuff to the already riddled with holes and jumps in logic plot. Oh, and let&#039;s not forget to add a single line of dialogue at the last scene concerning Yuzu&#039;s mother that indicates another sub-plot inside a sub-plot, as it turns out music somehow killed his father. Yeah sure, the 11th episode seems like the right place to do it, right before the climax of the main plot with Nino and Momo. Those people really have no idea how to do this, don&#039;t they? This is just trying to appeal to so many people that it ends up appealing to nobody, every little detail that someone could relate to lasts so short that there&#039;s no way to develop it. &quot;Jack of all trades. Master of none&quot;. Fits perfectly. I mean, it&#039;s fine if people feel like it relates to them on a personal level, but it doesn&#039;t represent a single thing well enough to call it a proper representative in my mind.<br />
By the way, does Nino even know anything about Momo? Because she seems to love him for so long, but what does she even know about him once they see each other again? He clearly isn&#039;t the same after all this time, so how can she still love him, how can she keep telling herself that she loves him? All it brings to her and others is pain, but what she seems to love isn&#039;t Momo, as in a person, but Momo, as in an image that she had when they were younger. That&#039;s what really makes me question this series, it pushes the suspension of disbelief too far. You would think that after all she suffers and after all the suffering it caused others to undergo, she would drop it. The explanation for not doing that, is that she loves Momo, but when you think about it, she actually doesn&#039;t, as I explained. It&#039;s a big faceplant right from the get-go really.<br />
And now let me tell you about the one thing that I like, it&#039;s a singular scene, with a singular idea. Yuzu can&#039;t sing, he lost his voice and can&#039;t recover it. When Nino finds out it&#039;s because he wanted to make her stop crying when they were little, he runs off to the roof, and she follows. They confront each other and he finds peace when Alice starts singing. What Yuzu does, is lip-sync to her singing, and calls her &quot;his voice&quot;. Like, this is a great, well thought out, impactful scene (even though it consists of characters standing and moving their enormous mouths a bit, so pretty much a still shot). Too bad all this wasn&#039;t set up properly, it was a rushed sub-plot introduced in the same episode. They sort of blew their load early, because no scene came even close to this level of thought.<br />
Oh, and I like the ED. It&#039;s nice, peaceful. The OP is fine too, but when you hear it so much it became annoying.<br />
<br />
This anime is like a leech. Upon finishing it I was almost drained out of all of my creativity and passion for anything. After finishing writing this review, all I wanted to do is sleep, because I believed that my dream could create a far better story than this show, this piece of fiction that was actually released as a 12 episode series, possible with quality checking and some sort of vision behind it. Turns out, I was right. My random, stupid dream about me riding a watermelon and crashing into my dad riding on a banana, and then us reuniting because we&#039;re close to each other after all, was more interesting and more expressive than this. So I want to warn you, that if you have any plans to write something soon, maybe even searching for inspiration on a similar topic, don&#039;t go searching here. Hell, if you just want to pick a random show, don&#039;t. You know what, don&#039;t even pick it up if you&#039;re looking for a bad show, if there&#039;s a risk that it could suck you dry as it did with me, why risk it? Turn back wanderer, you have traveled too far into the anime depth. Don&#039;t go any further, or I can&#039;t guarantee you&#039;ll come back in one piece. Your imagination might be left behind.<br />
<br />
As always, this is purely my opinion, but I can&#039;t recommend you to develop your own.

    This review may contain few spoilers. <br />
<br />
STORY (5)<br />
What I understood:<br />
~Nino and Momo are childhood friends, when they were younger, they used to sing &#039;&#039;Twinkle Little Star&#039;&#039; all the time and hold hands to go to school. But one day, Momo had to move and without Nino knowing, he disappeared, leaving her alone with her pain. That&#039;s where she met Yuzu, a young song writer that will eventually write songs just for Nino to sing.~<br />
<br />
What I felt: <br />
~It was WAY too overdramatic. You know, that feeling when you find a serie that could be good but then is so overdramatic that it turns cringy? Yeah...that&#039;s what

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251249">
        it felt like. Every episode was a battle of feeling &#039;&#039;trying to reach this or that person&#039;&#039;. Which was pretty annoying to a certain point. <br />
<br />
ART (6)<br />
~The art was pretty decent but the CGI, 3D animation of the concerts really threw me off. Those moments were really ugly and sadly, was bothering me more than anything. The problem is, when something bothers my eyes, I can&#039;t focus on the main plot, music and dialogues. Also, most of the CGI scenes were re-used few times in a same sequence. Other than that, the characters designs were pretty diverse and enjoyable. ~<br />
<br />
SOUND (8)<br />
~The music was probably the only thing that made so I didn&#039;t drop the serie. (Even tho those &#039;&#039;la la la la&#039;&#039; were pretty annoying after few episodes) I was glad to finally hear real lyrics and the main character&#039;s voice.<br />
<br />
Now, I&#039;m a huge fan of Hayami Saori (Nino&#039;s seiyuu), she dubbed many characters that I love and I always enjoyed her singing. BUT, why the hell did she have to sing in such a weird way as Nino? She sounded better in the last episodes but at the beginning, I couldn&#039;t understand how people (in the anime) would enjoy listening to her or even want her to be part of the group. Her bersek moments were terrible. And to be honest, I liked Miou&#039;s voice better...it was more controlled and prettier.~ <br />
<br />
CHARACTER (5)<br />
There are 3 noticable characters in this serie:<br />
<br />
Nino: The main girl who is obsessed with her childhood friend even tho he hurt her many times. Every episode, she would say &#039;&#039;Momo&#039;&#039; about 10 to 20 times (if not more), making me hate the cute and beautiful word that is &#039;momo&#039;.<br />
<br />
Momo: The useless, selfish childhood friend of Nino. That messes with Nino&#039;s feelings and would hurt her all the time. <br />
<br />
Yuzu: Probably the best character in the entire anime. He is kind and think about other people&#039;s feelings.<br />
<br />
The love triangle goes like this:<br />
Yuzu&gt;Nino&gt;&lt;Momo<br />
But sincerely, Momo only shows..wait..no...Momo only SAYS he likes her in the last 2 episodes. Which came out of no where, he just treated Nino like sh*t the entire anime. Yes, it really pisses me off. Yuzu obviously cares more about Nino but honestly, if he doesn&#039;t end up with Nino, I won&#039;t be mad, he sincerely deserves better than an idiot with the name Momo stuck in her empty head shell.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT (6)<br />
Most of the episodes were frustrating but I do think there was potential for better character developement. I feel like there are lots of plot holes (Momo&#039;s parents, Yuzu&#039;s mom, Miou, In NO hurry, etc.) making me question most of the characters personality and backstory.<br />
<br />
OVERALL (6)<br />
I did wait every week to watch the new episodes, so I can&#039;t say I disliked the anime. To be fair, there were good and bad moments, counter balancing themselves, making this anime nor a masterpiece, not a pile of crap. So my rate is 5 (average) + 1 more point (for Yuzu, my man) so that gives Fukumenkei Noise a fair 6 out of 10. Meaning this anime is FINE. <br />
<br />
I feel like there will be a next season. I might (or might not) watch it, depending on my mood.

    I really love this anime, first time i saw this anime I remembered NANA ( sweet memories)..so, all the people says &#039;&#039;is the same like fuuka but better&#039;&#039; &#039;&#039;this anime did the thing what fuuka never did in one only episode&#039;&#039;<br />
One point fuuka is a shonen and ecchi (yep, ecchi), Fukumenkei noise is Shoujo... with the 5  episodes i have seen of fukumenkei noise i can say this is master piece in  terms of shoujo.. maybe the animation isn&#039;t the better than other but think this anime could be better with &#039;&#039;moe animation&#039;&#039; animation is fine.. but the story and the character and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247759">
        music for me, is so fucking good, the VO of nino is so good, you know is Hayami Saori.  isn&#039;t boring to see this anime is so recommended..  this anime have potencial the manga was very popular in her time.. and maybe 12 episodes will be very short but i&#039;ll be happy with all the songs of In No Hurry..

    It doesn&#039;t matter if you don’t like alternative music. It doesn&#039;t even matter if you don’t like romance. Something really good can captivate the attention of people who aren’t even fans of the genre, and i’ll tell you, this is no groundbreaking show. I’ve seen it maybe 5 times in different variations, just mixed and matched here and there.<br />
<br />
-Story-<br />
4/10<br />
<br />
Fukumenkei is the exact epitome of it’s genre. It takes on a few cliches we’ve seen not once, but a trillion times:<br />
1.) The childhood friend love interest<br />
2.) A love triangle<br />
3.) The dense/oblivious to everything main character<br />
<br />
Now I must say though, just because an anime has these things

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251217">
        doesn&#039;t automatically make it bad, but it is something to note. It&#039;s all about how the show uses/portrays these things.<br />
<br />
 I’d have to say the biggest fail of this anime is the romance portion. These characters are incredibly melodramatic, unrealistic, and annoying. It is especially hard to take their “love” for one another seriously. A good backstory is imperative for this type of series;  Nino, Yuzu, and Momo’s stories aren’t something that seem to be anything more than a simple childhood crush that went on for way too long. They were children, it was not a practical enough love for them to still have feelings after six years. Even if it were, the show does a terrible job of portraying it that way, it&#039;s very hard to take seriously. None of it really makes much sense, now does it? and on top of that, after six years Nino expects everything/one to be the same. It really just irked me when things easily could have been resolved or talked though. I guess some of the charters have a case of feels too strong to have any sense of logic. <br />
<br />
-Music/Sound-<br />
6/10<br />
<br />
One thing Fukumenkei does well is showing it’s characters devotion/drive to music, each (main) character has their own reasons for striding to success. Gradually through the series Nino grows closer to In No Hurry and their music until they come together. Now, Nino’s voice is a questionable one, it isn’t one you’d expect to be praised the way it is in the show. However, Nino’s voice served to portray her emotions and personality, and it did just that. She isn’t supposed to sound as tamed and Miou, the point was to make her sound out of control. Even her band members see this and point it out. So it isn’t really that people are praising how well she sings, it’s how crazy she gets on stage, how raw her emotions are.<br />
<br />
The few twists regarding the band are also rather cliche and predictable, however, the band itself is by no means bad. I enjoyed their music, even wished I could have gotten more of it. <br />
<br />
-Characters-<br />
5/10<br />
<br />
The characters of Fukumenkei aren’t anything special, we’ve seen them all before. Although they do fit well for this type of story. Nino is a strong willed, free spirited girl, she gave her all in whatever task she had in front of her (unless Momo came rollin’ in). Yuzu had a similar quality to him, although he&#039;s a bit more stubborn but caring in his own way. Momo. Momo&#039;s got issues the majority of the anime, honestly I found him annoying- his emotions and actions contradict and his view of Nino is very confusing. His character isn’t as developed as Nino’s or Yuzu’s. Side characters like Ayumi and Yoshito barely had any real showtime or character development. Miou was the only character besides the mains that we really have some sort of understanding personality wise.<br />
<br />
-Art-<br />
Eh/10<br />
<br />
I am no fan of this stows art style but it for sure works well for the story/feel overall. <br />
Definitely thought there were moments where the characters looked pretty odd though.<br />
<br />
-Enjoyment/Overall-<br />
Eh.<br />
<br />
That’s really what this should should be given, an eh. Because that’s all it really is. Despite everything, I don’t hate this anime, no. Although I was very disappointed by it. Music/romance anime is one of my all time favorite genres. <br />
Fukumenkei falls short on so much, it attempts to be something good while having the same regurgitated themes we commonly see in this type of anime, without even trying to use them in an interesting way. Fukumenkei is a shit storm of illogic melodrama. The show is cliche to the point where things become predictable; we see Nino distraught over Momo, pushing herself to sing while Yuzu admires her in silence SEVERAL times. I felt like something was missing to make me feel more empathy towards the characters. This may just be because I found Nino&#039;s backstories with Yuzu and Momo childish, but the characters overall are pretty childish. <br />
<br />
In No Hurry’s  journey as a band/ their music was the highlight of this show for me. Everything else definitely feel way too short.<br />
<br />
 If you’re a fan of these genres, i’d say check it out. Mind you, this is all just one opinion. <br />
<br />
5/10<br />
It’s cliche, it’s  painfully average, it’s lackluster.<br />
In other words it’s most  shoujo. <br />

    This anime is VERY niche, it needs to fit your tastes both musically and in the genre that it is.<br />
<br />
For me, I&#039;m seriously enjoying Fukumenkei Noise as is, Nino has a voice that you either love or hate, and for me, I love it. In NO Hurry To Rush are an alternative band, and I love the music sequences, they&#039;re enjoyable. The story is a cliche in every sense of the word, but it&#039;s enjoyable if you like a cliche and like a love triangle. The art style isn&#039;t usually up my alley, but I think that the studio did a great job with it.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review248888">
        <br />
<br />
if you like listening to alternative music, if you like teenage drama and if you&#039;re into a good love triangle, this is definitely for you.

WARNING:THIS REVIEW HAS CONTENT HARMFUL TO KIDS(so i guess that means it will be fun)<br />
<br />
Anyways, i was too hungover cause i&#039;m too old to be drinking like the world is about to end and since it has been a little while since i watced any kind of anime i decided to pump myself full of painkillers and watch some shit....As to why i chose this particular shit i cannot tell but here we are and these are my thoughts on Anonymous Noise: The soundtrack of my worst nightmares.<br />
<br />
To kick things off AN wastes no time pushing the pedal to the metal by introducing us to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review303291">
        a song so brutal and technical, the likes of which can only be heard from bands such as Cannibal Corpse, Lamb of God, Slipknot etc.<br />
<br />
Wanna take a guess which one i&#039;m talking about? It isn&#039;t that hard people come on, even kids know this shit..Nope? Well let me put you out of your misery and tell you.....IT&#039;S FUCKING TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STAR!<br />
<br />
I know, i know you expected something from Cradle of Filth maybe but no, this anime makes Dani Filth and his friends look like a christian metal band from Illinois...What? You don&#039;t believe me? Well good news cause your instinct was right on the money! No this anime is trying to be Your Lie in April by not being Your Lie in April. I know it sounds interesting but trust me, it isn&#039;t that at all. Cause what AN did to differentiate itself from YLIA was shittier animation.<br />
<br />
But more on that later on, for now let&#039;s see what&#039;s the story, shall we?<br />
<br />
So, Nino(the female MC) is a girl who had a friend named Momo and every night they would sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star together under the starry sky. One day though Momo had to be put down cause he had rabies...No he didn&#039;t actually cause that would be interesting in a weird, twisted way and AN doesn&#039;t do either! With Momo gone Nino did the healthy thing and did what every other kid does....Put on a mask and play for a deathcore band!<br />
<br />
Damn i can do this all day and will never get old..Nope she really did put on a mask like those they wear in hospitals to avoid expressing her emotions and scream.....Yup, not fucking with you this time, even i with my wild imagination couldn&#039;t come up with such a Freudian approach...At this point in the anime begins what i&#039;d like to call &quot;the storm of weirdly convenient just so happens situations&quot;... So one day, she meets another boy named Yuzu who likes to write compositions in the sand at the beach. Nino reads the music and begins singing the notes which makes Yuzu hard. Yuzu said some crap about finding his voice and then left...Poor Nino was all alone again and fast forward a few years Nino enters high school where she finds out that Yuzu goes to the same school as her and is a part of the Cultural Music Club which she later becomes a member discovering their dark secrets and somewhere along the way she also finds out that Momo is attending the same school as well.<br />
At this point i&#039;m sure you all are scratching your heads and one question echoes in your brains. WHERE THE HELL WHERE HER PARENTS?<br />
<br />
And here begin many of the issues i had with this anime. I mean this girl has some major issues and the most obvious one was wearing a mask for no apparent reason for most of her life and nobody wonders what the hell is going on with her? Then it&#039;s her crush with a boy which if you really sit and think about is....I don&#039;t know....Maybe let&#039;s call it disturbing? Not normal in any way? Sure we all had that guy/girl we really liked as kids but i don&#039;t think we gave it a second thought after, say, 2 days. It&#039;s called moving on with your damn life.<br />
<br />
Next in line is Yuzu who i can only describe as a cuck(please don&#039;t make me explain google it). He has a crush with Nino since childhood and never forgot about her..He even went and made a band with her in mind in the hopes that she&#039;ll join him and sing together ritualistic songs to summon the dark lord himself and make little satan loving children..But as is always the case, deals with the devil don&#039;t go as planned and he ends up being an emotional cructh for Nino to use to overcome her feelings for someone she hasn&#039;t seen since the medieval times. Even when he manages to &quot;confess&quot; his feelings he quickly falls back to his cuck form and prompts her with all of his might to jump onto Momo and drain him from his bodily fluids.<br />
<br />
As for Momo.....Dear lord deliver me from characters with no characterization. Sure Momo has some backstory which was explored for all 3 seconds but apart from that i think he was there just to be there so we can be reminded that he exists...Apart from the fact that Nino calls his name every 3 god damn seconds...And no i&#039;m not being stupid i swear, she litterally says &quot;Momo&quot; every 2 lines or so.<br />
<br />
So far this seems like twilight but even more stupider...So where does the music fit in?<br />
<br />
Like i said Yuzu has a band which Nino joined later on to become their vocalist. This band is their secret thus they all wear masks and disguise as characters from Alice in Wonderland..So like Slipknot but more mainstream..<br />
<br />
I really liked this part of the anime cause the band was alt rock and all was well until the one who voiced Nino started singing. Make no mistake she has a nice-ish voice but it&#039;s not for this kind of music. Rock needs guts and rasp and soul which she didn&#039;t have..For a pop band she would be perfect cause that needs no skill at all but rock is another realm of vocal ranges altogether. The end result is appaling, she sure tries her best to sound the part but ends up putting out screams that animals make when they die. I don&#039;t know who thought she was the best pck but i hope you rot in hell for all eternity for this sacrilege.<br />
<br />
To add insult to injury all performances by the band are in CG, which seems to be a trend in anime these days cause it saves money and time...So naturally the on screen product looks like watching the fat, sweating face of Ron Jeremy in a porn film when he climaxes.. Not a beautiful sight is it? Well fuck you, you&#039;re gonna get CG in many other scenes as well..Feeling the burn in your eyes already?<br />
<br />
And don&#039;t think that the rest of the animation is even remotely better cause it isn&#039;t. I found many instances where the animation was wayyyyyyyyyyyyy inconsistent and weirdly scenes where even the food depiction was better than the one for characters.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t think there is more to say about this anime..Unhealthy obssessions, love triangles, the characters and their motivations are paper thin and at times borderline retarted and of course twinkle twinkle...And i&#039;m not joking about this part of the anime, there&#039;s an entire episode with nothing but that. The conclusion of the series is just a huge leap back to where it all started, with Momo ditching Nino again because his evil mom threatened to hurt her, Nino quitting the band without any explanation for it, Yuzu quitting the band without any explanation for it, while helping Nino get dicked down by Momo…<br />
<br />
So if you want to watch rehashed scenes over and over again, a story that goes nowhere and characters that play no part in their own story please do go ahead..

    IS EDITED AFTER THE END OF SEASON:<br />
Ever seen one of those flip cartoons? The art kinda has that feeling to it in some scenes wich bugs me out, some movements made by the different characters seem kinda out of place as well. But for me, that is pretty much all the critic I can give it that actually annoys me.<br />
<br />
The story is rather plain and. One girl, two boys, conflict is ensured. While I&#039;m still not sure how it will end, wich many animes fail horribly at, the story is kept alive thanks to the characters.<br />
<br />
Now you might think of them as generic and you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review248908">
        would not be wrong, we have a dream chasing female protagonist with two boys influencing and conflicting her life and choices nothing too special. However, what makes these characters stand out is a very nice connection to the music that plays during the show. They are both harsh.<br />
<br />
They portray feelings more forward and clumsily while still maintaining that oh so classic &quot;I can&#039;t reveal my feelings&quot; cliché, but it feels so much more life like that way. Emotions are rash, irrational and harsh and the way the music is used to describe the feelings or try to reach out is harsh and there&#039;s a charm and an understanding of being a musician that is hidden from plain view. What is also very important is that every note doesn&#039;t HAVE to sound good or ring out clearly, the fact that sometimes it dosen&#039;t adds very much to the feeling of being a musician, an amateur, a dreamer.<br />
<br />
Added Comment: Oh no. It has 3-d animation.<br />
<br />
If you are searching for a music-themed anime with a direct conflict and connection of emotions and character this is the one.

    I&#039;ve decided that good reviews are boring and I no longer want to do them. It&#039;s a lot more fun to tear into a nice, meaty, malignant tumor. Fukumenkei Noise is one such tumor that I have allowed myself to watch 8 episodes of. This review contains minor spoilers, but that&#039;s really irrelevant because nothing I spoil contributes anything to the story. Nothing contributes to the story. There is no fucking story. Let&#039;s get into that.<br />
<br />
Now I&#039;m not some old geezer who hates on all highschool drama anime, in fact I&#039;m quite a big fan of Yahari and Nagi no Asukara, despite their flaws. I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249917">
        like drama. But there is a fine line between drama and melodrama. Drama intrigues you, immerses you, and doesn’t inject you with fatal doses of second hand embarrassment. Melodrama is the exact opposite. It pushes you away from it with tidal waves of cringe force that radiate with Chernobyl level nuclear radiation that robs you of your fertility and gives you limbs you don’t need. The thing that separates drama from melodrama, at least one of the things, is build-up and pay-off. Drama builds up to a dramatic moment with character development, well-written and well-paced dialogue, and relevant plot-points that would actually affect the story if removed. It’s like a really good Thai massage pro who knows exactly the right level of grip and velocity to jerk your dick with, making you arch your back like a quadratic function for the climax. Melodrama doesn’t like to build up. It likes to get the job over with. It doesn’t want to jerk your dick or suck your nipples. Heck, it doesn’t even want to fiddle with your asshole. It just yanks your meat rod hoping that you come, and after spending 50 hard-earned dollars with a semi chub, you just go home with a deep pain in your heart and your groin. Maybe even your soul. Reacting as unnaturally sad as possible to any situation thrown their way is like a hobby of the characters. “Oh shit, my childhood friend moved. Instead of being kind of sad and moving on, I’d much rather talk about how much I’m suffocating (because that’s normal) and for some reason, wear a fucking facemask.” The characters just love screaming and shouting so much I feel like I could sample the dialogue for a harsh noise track. The first episode, we literally just meet Yuzu for a minute and already the melodrama starts. “Don’t ever talk to me” in a serious and dark tone. And also love triangles, because those aren’t absolute garbage. Oh, also apparently in high school the only thing that matters is your love life. Nobody cares about their grades, or their FUCKING ATTENDANCE. HOLY SHIT EVERYBODY CUTS CLASS LIKE IT&#039;S A PIECE OF UNWANTED FORESKIN. How is a school just going to let its students skip class constantly? How come the students feel it&#039;s ok to just skip class for no fucking reason other than “I’m sad now because I was rejected and I don’t want to sing and I want to cry.” That’s actually the exact reason for 100% of the time people cut class in this anime. Not kidding. <br />
<br />
Oh. by the way, if you ever feel like you&#039;re not getting your fix of mind-numbing monologue, hit this show up. Virtually everything the characters feel is explained through monologue or dialogue. Maybe don’t assume I’m a retard, and that I can infer how characters feel based on their actions and reactions? It’s a shame because some of the moments could actually be more heartfelt if given proper pacing. The scene where Yuzu is trying to sing on the roof but can’t actually do it almost brought some emotion out of me, and might have actually made tear up if they executed it properly.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s get the art and animation out of the way because it&#039;s not a huge deal here. Imagine Code Geass drawn by a 14 year old in an anime facebook group. Or more like Code Geass drawn by a sedated paraplegic. The mouth animations rarely match what the characters are saying/singing, which is annoying and cringe-worthy at the same time, but also worth a good laugh.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is a huge part of this anime, but it&#039;s pretty 50/50. Alice’s vocals, though out of pitch sometimes, are good when she’s shouting at the top of her lungs, like at the beginning of the concert in the first episode, or her first concert with In No Hurry. It doesn&#039;t match up with the instrumentals, but it feels charming. When she actually wants to sing properly, however, she can’t keep a fucking pitch, not even in the opening, and it ends up sounding awkward as fuck, like the later parts of her song in the first episode. I don’t understand how anyone likes her voice in the concerts. It’s absolutely horrendous. She’s fucking garbage. Everyone in the audience is just smiling and being moved by this “charismatic, powerful voice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111one1!!!!!!!!!!!” She sounds like a sex-deprived monkey with down syndrome. She’s literally trash. They have to make the characters tell us that her voice is good because they know the audience won’t actually think so.The instrumentals are pretty good as far as alternative J-rock goes. I might have even listened to their shit on a regular basis if Marina was chosen as the singer. I still listen to Girls Dead Monster and Zhiend songs. They would be a lot better if they were a post-punk band. They could have been a better version of Sonic Youth. Also, this might be a nit-pick, but the “Lalala” shit Alice does makes me want to fucking kill myself. Can’t they use a more natural syllable? Like “Da” or “Na”? Pretty sure most people hum like that. I don’t know what it is about the “La” syllable but it just feels so unnatural.<br />
<br />
The characters, however, are where the series starts to shine. Well, as shiny as a piece of shit can get if it&#039;s polished with semen and the tears of starving children. The characters aren&#039;t one dimensional, but rather a dimension below that. Imagine a line that moves in one single direction for the duration of its purpose. But the line is an overweight jockey on a sick mule, running across a preset path in a desolate wasteland. In case you didn&#039;t get the analogy, they&#039;re all tropes. No, less than tropes. They don&#039;t embody the entire trope, but rather one single specific aspect of that trope, which makes them sort of unique, in an incredibly annoying way. It’s like the sole purpose of Alice’s existence is to be in love with Momo, and the sole purpose of Yuzu’s existence is to be in love with Alice, and the sole purpose of Miou&#039;s existence is to be in love with Yuzu, and the sole purpose of Haruno&#039;s existence is to be in love with Miou. Kind of like every other anime of this kind. They do nothing else except music, but hobbies don’t substitute actual character traits. There is no nuance whatsoever. Alice does everything only for Momo, and that’s annoying and boring at the same time. She doesn’t sing for herself, she doesn’t act for herself, she barely even thinks in her own interest. She’s not a good character. There’s this running gag of her not listening to what people say but that just annoys me more. Same with the running gag about Yuzu being short and drinking milk. I get a good laugh out of this cast, but not for the reason they were intended. I&#039;m usually laughing to drown out the fact that I hate my life and also that these characters were written by a fetus. They say basic, tropey things, but at the most awkward times, as if the writers have no sense of timing. The kids don’t act like kids half the time. They talk like they’re already high schoolers. And when they’re high schoolers they act like fucking children. None of the characters can decide what emotion they want to feel. It’s like they have three emotions to choose from and they put them all on shuffle. Also they all have bipolar disorder. Who the fuck cries because their singing didn’t “reach” someone who they were friends with several years ago? Get over it. God this shit is annoying. “I’m gonna shut my eyes, hunch over a little bit, and scream for no significant reason!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!killme!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”<br />
<br />
Moreover, Alice is kind of retarded sometimes when she’s singing. She holds her head like an autistic child having a migraine headache and starts moving around in weird ways as if to signal her lifelong dream of getting burned alive by her childhood crush. Sometimes I feel she should achieve that dream sooner. It&#039;s better than trying to achieve the impossible dream of being a halfway decent singer. Oh, she’s also retarded in the way that, when a girl throws her earrings into the ocean, she blindly runs into that ocean to find those earrings. Fully clothed, in her shoes, as if she could actually find them. I want to see what would happen if I threw a fresh egg into an ocean of horse shit. Her dialogue is the absolute worst as well.<br />
<br />
After all this, why did I give it a 4, you ask? Well, because sometimes I had a laugh at the cringe-worthiness of the execution. Also, it did a damn good job at tightening the noose around my neck. I don&#039;t know when it got there, but now it&#039;s fastened tight and ready to do its job.<br />

    Fukumenkei Noise is one of the anime that I thought I will never like but after I first watched the first episode. So I decided to watch more and more until I couldn&#039;t stop it, many people suggested that I should also read the manga, but I prefer to watch anime completely before I take on the manga part.<br />
<br />
For me, I can fully relate to the female main character, as the story progresses, her struggles get worser and worser. As for the other male main characters,  I understand their struggles and the way they act. I can see this anime becoming one of those

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249576">
        animes that will make you cry at the end or during mid-story even.<br />
<br />
I enjoy an anime where people can really relate to, it also has been awhile since I have watched something like this. I am just curious how the story will progress even further. <br />

    At first glance, Fukumenkei Noise might be assumed to be just like any other typical shoujo series. There&#039;s the self-insert female protagonist, the love triangle filled with boys who have jerkish traits, the usual combination of factors of what makes a shoujo romance series. However, unlike the typical shoujo series, it provides very good clear reasons for why the characters are the way they are as well as a thematic that fits the feel of the show. Even if it is fairly typical, some key elements allow it to shine.<br />
<br />
The characters account for a lot of what makes the show so good, and one prime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251274">
        example of that is Nino. Nino is like most shoujo MCs. She falls completely in love with the jerk-like male MCs and thinks about them all of the time. (Although at least she is more aware rather than being in constant denail.) Now in most cases, this can be annoying as it takes what could be a complex interesting character who should have multiple layers of interest and simplifies them down to just liking boys. As if boys are all that matters to a girl. However, Nino is able to subvert this with a couple of key facts.<br />
<br />
Most female shoujo protagonists are just your average girl. They&#039;re boring, dull, and average. Nino isn&#039;t average. Nino is weird. Nino is troubled. While everyone else does the normal school life, Nino walks around with big headphones listening to music and spends lots of time singing aimlessly at the beach. She doesn&#039;t appear to think on the same wavelength as others do, and she frequently doesn&#039;t listen to others. Even in the show, there were multiple times where the characters told her that she was weird, and her response was to shrug and say, &quot;Yeah I&#039;m weird. That&#039;s who I am.&quot; She even says she wears a surgical mask because it helps her from screaming. Repeatedly she&#039;s had spasms on stage and erupted into an unpredictable emotional mess. None of these actions are normal. Some of them may be experienced by certain subcultures, but rarely would those people consider themselves as normal. Every bit and part of her down to the way that she things directly flies in the face of a normal girl. And because of that, it&#039;s much easier to accept her tunnel vision.<br />
<br />
Especially when one digs into her past life. As in the premise, she got close to both of these boys and twice where they cruelly ripped away from her world. She got close to them and cared about them only for them to disappear. I too had a childhood that consisted of hopping from friendship group to friendship group. I changed schools twice in elementary school, and twice did my friends move away. I didn&#039;t have a constant friendship group. I didn&#039;t have friends that lasted longer than a year. It messes with your mind, especially when you&#039;re that young. It feels like nothing will last forever, and it feels like only a matter of time before fate rips you apart. And if she&#039;s anything like me, and I think she is, when this is combined with the need and want to be close to others it results in a mindset that can idealize someone so heavily, and eye them so much, that they become one of the most important things. They are what matters. They are the reason for moving forward. Combine this with other emotional problems and it becomes a disaster. The disaster that Nino is.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t want to belabour the point too much but there were moments that Nino had that reminded me of myself.  There were neurotic moments that she had that may seem crazy to most but mirror exact moments and things that I have done before. For who she is Nino is a great character, one that likely also suffers from mental illness, and that&#039;s what makes her so relatable and perfect for the role. She isn&#039;t a competent average girl reduced down to just BOYS, she&#039;s a struggling obsessive mess who wants the happy times of her childhood back.<br />
<br />
And then there are the boys. In the usual shoujo series, the boys are dicks with pure hearts inside even if they never show it. And overall one could say that these boys fit into these roles, however, they also break apart from them at the same time. <br />
<br />
In the case of Yuzu, he is possessive and wants Nino all to himself. There are parts of him that want her to be his and only his. But at the same time, he wants the best for her as well. Throughout the show, he is stuck between trying to further himself and his own goals or whether to support Nino in her goals. Sometimes he takes steps towards his own wants grabbing her and pushing her closer to him, while other times he listens to her. He listens to her wants and tries to help her out and give her advice. He tries to help her make her goal. He routinely does this, weakening his own position but he does it for her. It&#039;s the strive of love where one wants something so badly but they also want their love to be happy. It&#039;s a feeling that is so relatable and so human. Humans aren&#039;t perfect beings, they have conflicting wants. And the way that Yuzu expresses it I can understand it so well. <br />
<br />
Although I don&#039;t relate to Momo nor do I care for him much I do think he&#039;s also another really interesting character who has his own baggage. His struggles are the struggles between maturity and the childlike wants that still reside in a person. While he wants to have Nino and go back to the times of yore, he has a job and has things that he has to take care of. He can&#039;t go back to his sweet escape, and he feels like he has betrayed Nino, and betrayed his childhood. He takes his steps forward never looking back. The struggle he faces is another struggle that many face. When we grow up can we still desire for the things we wanted before? Our childhood dreams? In Fukumenkei Noise this conflict takes an interesting role in the relationship between them.<br />
<br />
Even the side characters are well written and rather than them all be jerks to each other they&#039;re all overall nice, although flawed. Miou and Nino help each other out and give each other advice even though it&#039;s not always in their best interest to do so. And that&#039;s just the serious moments, there are also lots of fun playful moments between the band, Yuzu and Nino, Nino and Miou and others. It feels like more than just melodrama, it doesn&#039;t even feel like melodrama sometimes. While there are a few exaggerated moments, (like their parents) for the most part it feels like the result of their feelings and their ills. Even with some of the more hyperbolic emotional moments it never felt out of place. It felt so right. <br />
<br />
The music also plays an important role. Not only are the ideas on muse interesting, but they&#039;re very accurate given my own experience. I am a composer myself and I know the value of a muse, and how different emotions can sway one&#039;s writing, and their playing and all of that. And Fukumenkei Noise has this down to a T. Not only that but they&#039;re able to create music and lyrics that not only fit the show and the characters that write them but that are generally well written and convey strong emotions even better than most songs. They come from the heart and shine with the emotions that lie in them. Hayami, Saori did a great job with Nino&#039;s singing as it feels so emotional and it feels so authentic. I have tried to sing with raw emotion and it&#039;s really hard. But she is able to nail it so perfectly that I feel the emotion dripping from Nino&#039;s voice as she sings, and it hits me right in the heart. <br />
<br />
The way that music is used to both express themselves and release the emotional tension that&#039;s inside them is so well done. It mirrors the struggles of the plot and it enhances the struggle of the plot. Fukumenkei Noise is a music anime in the truest sense of the word. Not only is it about music but the way that it lives and breathes and relates to the themes of the show and the emotions of the characters it ends up working so perfectly well.<br />
<br />
I think the story is overall great. It&#039;s a basic story but the musical themes, and the ways the characters drive the story are fantastic. The art is mostly great and works well with it too, except for when they do the CG. Why did they do the CG it looks awful.<br />
<br />
Overall this show is an underrated gem. The characters are fantastically designed and the music fits so perfect with what the show does. It may have some of the typical shoujo trappings but it actually works to the shows advantage because of how well they&#039;re done and how well they work. Most shows aren&#039;t able to get me to relate to even one character, but here both Nino and Yuzu feel like kindred souls lost in the same struggle and emotions that I am. I am in awe at Fukumenkei Noise&#039;s ability to speak to me, and it&#039;s ability to write well naused characters. This show may be ripe with teenage melodrama, but it all fits so right.

I welcome feedback on my reviews<br />

Singing has the power to captivate people. Everyone knows this. Any good singer knows how to use the full extent of their vocal abilities to draw in their audience and leave them wanting more. It can bring up feelings of calmness, excitement, love or hatred, allowing us to forget our many daily woes and just enjoy the moment. May we be the ones listening or the ones on stage, all that truly matters during that performance is the singing.<br />
<br />
Anonymous Noise is the love triangle between Nino Arisugawa, Kanade Yuzuriha and Momo Sakaki, a group of students that all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251302">
        have a love for music. Once childhood friends and now unfortunately seperated for various reasons, they slowly find out they all go to the same school and try and rekindle their lost spark. The story, although nothing special, is quite interesting as it throws in different aspects such as romance, music and the feeling of loss. From students to professional musicians, it takes us on a journey that is fairly enjoyable.<br />
<br />
The drama that appears in this anime is quite thrown together, taking in tragic backstories from each of the three mains to create the base and bulk of the problems the characters face. However, the anime has a problem of showing these same backstories over and over, forcing them down our throats as if we didn&#039;t hear them the first time. It quickly loses it impacts as it starts to get annoying seeing the same thing over and over.<br />
<br />
Romance is explored, but it&#039;s not very satisfying. To get the gist, Yuzu (Yuzuriha&#039;s nickname) and Momo are in love with Alice, (Nino&#039;s nickname) while Alice is only in love with Momo and sees Yuzu as a friend. You may think that there is a simple solution to this love triangle, as Alice clearly only has feelings for one of them, but certain circumstances (looking back at their backstories again) prevent the two from being able to share their feelings. It&#039;s also quite frustrating seeing how Yuzu tries to get Alice to have feelings for him, but she&#039;s just too dumb to realise them. Instead of it being lovely and sweet, it becomes incredibly annoying.<br />
<br />
Most of the characters are shown with flaws about their music and/or love lives, providing an interesting spectacle as they all struggle to deal with everything that is thrown at them. Looking past their choices over romance, they&#039;re all fairly likeable and bring their own perspectives and personalities to create a pretty nice cast.<br />
<br />
The music, sadly, wasn&#039;t exactly my kinda thing. I could enjoy it, but I don&#039;t find myself listening to that type of music outside of the anime. The only parts of the music where it got slightly annoying is the constant LA LA LA during the start of the series. It never felt natural most of the time, just something thrown into the show to add a little makeshift depth to Alice&#039;s character.<br />
<br />
Comedy was an area that felt the most poorly done, as it would feel out of place most of the time. Even during moments that were meant to be serious, comedy would just appear out of nowhere, ruining the flow of scene and preventing us to fully get into the show.<br />
<br />
Anonymous Noise was ok. It had its good points, but it kept doing things that upset the way the show was flowing. It would be a decent watch if you can look past these types of issues, but I myself would not recommend it. I&#039;m in NO hurry to rewatch this.

    First of all, I dont usually like Shoujo, Ive watched some and thats all. Its cute, sometimes you cry, sometimes you smile, but if Im not in the mood for it I get bored.<br />
That is not how it works for Fukumenkei Noise, I really liked it, it was good, its true that Fukumenkei Noise have its problems, the first is Yuzu. Yuzu is... how can I say it? Yuzu is annoying, he is the &quot;I love her but I cant tell her&quot; dude, so he just treat her bad, and thats freackin annoying, its stupid, its the kind of cliche you see in romance movies.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315010">
        But thats it, for a first season its pretty good.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
-Nino is cute and she wants to tell Momo she loves him since she couldnt in the past<br />
-Yuzu is... I hate him<br />
-Momo is the cold guy that the fandom loves, he have his reasons to be like this, he is a good character.<br />
-Haruyoshi is my favorite character, altought being a suportting character he is the best person in Fukumenkei Noise, he sacrifice his own happiness for the sake of the person he loves and for his friend, he is also funny and... BASS.<br />
-Ayumi is the suportting character that is just there to be the comic guy, he is funny and thats it.<br />
-Miou is the supportting character that acts like any cliche spoiled tsundere<br />
<br />
Plot<br />
<br />
It has a cute plot, its something you will like to watch, it works for a shoujo and at the same time, seeing the development of the band makes it less boring. Problem is: sometimes shoujo destroy the band development, like Nino thinking about Momo when you think she will think about the band, woooowie.<br />
<br />
Music<br />
<br />
NOW THIS IS THE GREAT PART, okay, some people see Nino screaming during Canario and Haruyoshi, Yuzu and Ayumi missing the chords and think:<br />
Ok, stop this shit, this is wrong and it insults music<br />
But Canario is a good song, and those missing chords and that screaming voice is just right, think:<br />
A Teenager is on the stage and she starts panicking, then she is hit by an anxiety crisis, its just normal for her to start screaming, and doing that, its just normal for the band to miss the chords, tone must be paired up with the chords. Its great, it sounds real enought and I like it.<br />
<br />
Overral<br />
<br />
Good Points<br />
<br />
-Some good chacacters<br />
-Shoujo along with band development, that makes it not so annoying<br />
-Great songs<br />
-Realistic situations on the stage<br />
-Cute romantic plot<br />
-Stable animation<br />
<br />
Bad Points<br />
<br />
-Shallow character development, but being fair, its only one season<br />
-Some cliche characters<br />
-Shoujo breaking the band development<br />
-There are few characters in the anime, thats a problem, thats a big problem<br />
-Bad 3D animation, but its not used so often so... meh

    this is my review<br />
<br />
I personally loved this anime because i was waiting for a long time to watch a good romance, crama and mainly a shoujo anime. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
the story might seem familiar to many people but there are aspects to it which are different. the part where childhood friends meet again is an old concept but they vrought music into it and i really liked that. <br />
the story contains funny and sad moments, it has a good mixture which makes it really interesting and fun to watch.<br />
the episodes were prerfectly paced but the last tow episodes were rushed, it could have easily been a 22

          <span style="display: none;" id="review268529">
        eopisodes long anime.<br />
the ending was a good for season 1, but if they won&#039;t release a season 2,it might leave you a bit unhappy.<br />
9/10<br />
<br />
art:<br />
the characters designs could have been improved, especially the main female lead, otherwise, i was personally satisfied with it.<br />
the quality of the anime was good, i wouldn&#039;t watch an anime if the quality was bad, regardless of how good the story is.<br />
8/10<br />
<br />
sound:<br />
music is a huge part of this anime and i loved all of the music in this anime, from OST sound tracks to musics that were performed in this anime. <br />
10/10<br />
<br />
enjoyment:<br />
this anime was really enjoyable, it is hard to impress me but this anime was able to do that. it had a good mixture of funny, sad and dramatic scenes which made it really exciting. <br />
10/10<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
<br />
<br />

    People didn´t like this because it was too cliched and too overdramatic. Well, I liked it because it was a music-oriented anime after all. Artists need to be sentimental and eccentric to feel inspired for their music, they aren´t  ordinary people in the first place.<br />
<br />
What I didn´t like that much is that they overused the flashbacks even in the middle of a concert! I get why though, they only had like 12 episodes to show and had to include every possible content until the end. <br />

There´s still the manga ongoing so it´s a nice intro to a decent shoujo that can be liked by

    After watching the show I came to MAL and read the reviews. It seems many people disliked Fukumenkei Noise because Alice is quite annoying by always sing &quot;la la la&quot; in the very first episode along with the boring story, but I don&#039;t think so. <br />
<br />
There are reasons for her behaviors and it makes sense. The more you watch the show, the more you understand and will empathy with her. She&#039;s stubborn and not the kind of person who tells people she loves A and then at the last episode it turns out that she falls in love with someone else. I love Alice&#039;s personality.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320707">
        Everyone in this show loyal to the one they love, and I like that.<br />
<br />
About the story, it good but nothing has solved and many questions left unanswered in the last episode. That&#039;s because the story still goes on, this is not the end. I hope there&#039;s will be season 2 soon. I want to know more about Alice&#039;s stories, Momo&#039;s stories, Yuzu&#039;s stories as well as stories of others.<br />
<br />
The music is excellent. The first time Nino perform on her high school&#039;s stage got me hooked to this show. Words can&#039;t describe how I felt. Her voice is so powerful, so raw, contains so much of her feeling and there&#039;s something more in Alice&#039;s voice that attracted me.<br />
Fukumenkei Noise&#039;s songs are really good, I don&#039;t have anything to complain about.<br />
<br />
In summary, this is a very good show and I recommended you to watch it.

    STORY 5/10<br />
The story is the weakest point of this anime, it is a story that is not simple but with inconsistencies and with very common moments. The story goes back to Nino, a student who has been singing for almost her entire life to catch up with Momo, her childhood friend of hers who moved out of town without prior notice. With all that, Nino gets on with Yuzu who teaches him the basics of singing music. Nowadays Nino must join the group that Yuzu created for her and where she will try to reach Momo more easily. It is not a bad premise, obviously

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402152">
        it could be better but it is enough not to fail. The problem is that in many moments of the story there are very forced events or changes in the attitude of characters that do not make sense just so that the story does not stay stagnant and follow its original flow. An example would be that Nino has always been shown as a childish and very carefree girl and when Yuzu kisses her she changes her attitude and shows herself as someone mature who has been angered by what happened when at no point in the series we have seen her that way.<br />
<br />
ART 8/10<br />
The animation of this work is quite good. There are no times when you say &quot;I can&#039;t stand to see this&quot; and it is generally quite enjoyable. It is true that in the moments of the beach they focus so much on making a good landscape that they forget to animate the characters well or make their eyes or mouth more detailed. But what I really like about art is that expressions are worked out a lot to make you emotional at times. At Nino&#039;s first concert with the group they cheer him on in such a way that you feel the song inside your heart. They also make you look very good when a character is nervous or depressed, in general the expressions are great.<br />
<br />
SOUND 10/10<br />
The sound effects are good. The sound of the guitar strings, the hits, the sudden silences of the soundtrack to make you see that it is a tense scene ... among many other things. But above all I want to mention the songs. It is probably the musical anime that has the best songs. When I finished it, I had my entire Play List with songs from In no Hurry to Shot. Canaria, Noise, Othello ... all perfect, they have no fault. They have feeling, good melody, good chorus and they are catchy, in this aspect Fukumenkei Noise is perfect.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER 6/10<br />
The characters are normal, as a strong point I would say that they are quite charismatic and they all have their personality fixed and that distinguishes them. Apart from that they have no evolution and a past to remember, obviously Nino, Yuzu and Momo yes but because they are the protagonists but the secondary cast should be taken into account more. Also mentioning that you dislike a character does not mean that he is bad, I am going to give you some examples, Ichika from Gotoubun no Hanayome dislikes everyone but he is the best character in his work, the same happens with Mami from Rent a Girlfriend, as irritating as she is, is a very good character. I also say that for Momo since I personally like her very badly but her actions are justified by the bad past she had and how it caused her evolution to reach this point.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT 7/10<br />
I have enjoyed this anime, in general I really like musical animes and if they have their point of romance, even better, the problem is that the point of romance in some aspects is poorly constructed, so as I was realizing, I did not enjoy it as much. <br />
<br />
In general it is a good anime, it is not perfect but if you do not know what to see I recommend it. I think that it should be taken more into account since it is little known but it is better that anime known worldwide.

       Story: 5/10<br />
<br />
It&#039;s your average love triangle plot, with some music elements to mix things up. It&#039;s nothing new and it doesn&#039;t really surprise you at any giving point. The worst part of the whole story was how there is never an actual conclusion to anything. There&#039;s no closure to at least give you some sense of fulfillment, which is one of the most frustrating aspects of Fukumenkei Noise. Also, I really don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair to even call this a love triangle when Yuzu never even had a chance to begin with. Honestly though, the story had potential, but they failed to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265435">
        make it shine to its full potential.<br />
<br />
   Art: 8/10<br />
<br />
It&#039;s pretty good and consistent overall, except here and there, especially in some of Momo&#039;s scenes where things just seemed a bit less worked on. Also, unfortunately, there&#039;s some CGI in the music scenes (it&#039;s very minor though), which I&#039;m not a fan of at all, so that takes away some of the immersion for me.<br />
<br />
   Sound: 9/10<br />
<br />
This is where Fukumenkei Noise really shined for me, I&#039;d even go as far to say that it was one of the main reasons why I kept watching until the end (besides Yuzu, that is). Personally, I was really captivated by Alice&#039;s voice. It&#039;s something I haven&#039;t come across before in all of the other music animes I&#039;ve seen. Now, of course, this will be all dependent on personal taste. I know from some reviews I&#039;ve read that some people really hate Nino&#039;s voice. However, if you do enjoy it, it will make you hang on a little bit longer. Personally, I&#039;ve even downloaded all of in No hurry&#039;s songs aftewards, if that goes to show you how much I&#039;ve liked them.<br />
<br />
   Character: 6/10<br />
<br />
Definitely one of Fukumenkei Noise&#039;s biggest flaws, apart from the story, is the main character, Nino/Alice. She isn&#039;t relatable, she&#039;s incredebly frustrating to watch (especially if you&#039;re on team Yuzu) and there&#039;s no real character development from her side, besides her voice training. On the other hand, I found both Momo and Yuzu enjoyable characters, they were more complex and thought out and felt way more human than Nino ever did. Despite all of that, every character in this story is still frustrating to watch at the end of it all, because the right choices for them to make are always in their grasp, yet they always go with the most obnoxious and angsty choice possible instead. Everyone&#039;s a masochist.<br />
<br />
   Enjoyment: 6/10<br />
<br />
Besides the music bits, there&#039;s not much to work with here. I do admit the first few episodes were a lot better than the last few. I felt like I was losing interest more and more with each episode, yet I powered through in the vain hope it would get better, that I would get something out of this whole ordeal. But, as I mentioned before, I didn&#039;t. There&#039;s no closure, no actual meaning to any of what you just watched. That alone annoys me enough to steer me away from reading the manga, which is still an ongoing project. Despite hearing it&#039;s actually better than the anime, I still have a bitter taste left from the anime, so I don&#039;t think I can handle diving back into this work just to get my heart broken all over again over nothing.<br />
<br />
   Overall: 6/10<br />
<br />
Are you missing anything if you don&#039;t watch Fukumenkei Noise? No, not really. If you&#039;re interested in the music aspect, I recommend watching the first episode and go from there. You get a great feel for what&#039;s to come musically and if you do end up enjoying it, watch up until you reach &quot;Canary&quot; and then you can skip right to the end where they finally debut a new song &quot;Noise&quot; (which is my least favourite of the three). If the music aspect isn&#039;t that appealing to you, I suggest you skip this and give the manga a shot, since it seems to be the better option. Overall, if you&#039;re looking for something like this, but with much better execution, character wise, I recommend you watch NANA. It&#039;s still frustrating to watch, but at least everything actually makes sense.

    &gt;&gt;SPOILERS&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
After seeing the comments and reviews on the anime series alone, it surprised me that it got negative feed backs much more than positive ones so I decided to write my review for this show. I may bring up spoilers for the manga or the anime, but I&#039;ll try my best to not let my love for the manga version of this series go in the way of my review.<br />
<br />
Story = 8<br />
The story is cliche, indeed. It doesn&#039;t stand out too much based on the sypnosis and cover art alone. At first, it seems like your typical romance, mainstream shoujo anime/manga full of predictable happenings,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266524">
        but when you start watching it and/or read it, it gets better between the character interactions and drama. Now, people may say that this story is overdramatic, or may contain LOTS of drama between episodes. I&#039;d like to say that the drama in this story is handled very well, despite the story being slow-paced (as for the reason why I think so, my opinion on this is in the &quot;overall&quot; section, my bad for putting it there).<br />
<br />
The anime covered a lot of things (yet there were some that they didn&#039;t cover from the original manga) that made a path for possible plot holes.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d like to say that the plot holes didn&#039;t bother me that much while watching the anime, but I&#039;d be lying about that. Here are the three main reasons and plot holes in which I gave the story an 8--- I believe everyone can at least relate to one of these reasons being annoying or soul crushing in the story.<br />
<br />
(1) Yuzu&#039;s love for Nino goes unrequited and he wasn&#039;t able to tell her how he TRULY felt; wanting to stay as &quot;just friends&quot;. And yes, Nino thought that Yuzu likes someone else even though he kissed her in that one scene. So basically, nothing progressed at all for the both of them. As this anime had just 12 episodes, Nino being able to move on from Momo and being able to be with In NO Hurry would be an IDEAL ending. Even if Yuzu wasn&#039;t able to be with her romantically, but no. Nothing happened.<br />
<br />
(2) Nino, despite being able to move on a bit out of her love for Momo in the middle of the story, came to love and care for Momo &quot;again&quot; on the last two episodes which is kind of annoying and irritating. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m sure nearly everyone relates on this kind of issue (crushing on your childhood friend), but in anime, it doesn&#039;t really work in a lot of ways.<br />
<br />
(3) Plot holes (i.e Yuzu&#039;s mom, Momo&#039;s mom, Momo&#039;s backstory, Miou&#039;s backstory, etc.)<br />
<br />
Despite the negatives, I&#039;m 60:50 on the story. I still found it enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Art = 7<br />
The big eyes disturb me, and honestly, Nino&#039;s character design oddly suits her personality--- this goes as well for the In NO Hurry members, Yuzu, Momo, and Miou.<br />
<br />
Sound = 9<br />
I&#039;m not a big fan of rock/electrical/just any ear-blasting music. &quot;High School&quot; that was sung by Nino in the first episode is horrible, too. The characters were all over her &quot;berserk&quot; voice while it sounded plain to me. Good thing Nino&#039;s voice got better and better in each and every episode--- not to mention, she sounded the best in the last two episodes. Her &quot;super berserk&quot; was done very well--- in ways I wasn&#039;t able to imagine.<br />
<br />
Character = 7<br />
I believe I&#039;ve already mentioned the character interactions once in this review. Feel free to look at the review I did for the three main protagonists in the &quot;Story&quot; section again if you want. I&#039;ll try to cover some other points but with a detailed explanation.<br />
<br />
(1) The In NO Hurry member&#039;s interactions with one another felt natural. At first, it didn&#039;t felt like it because of Miou and Haruno&#039;s (Haruyoshi-senpai) issues and problems with Nino. But right after dealing with it, it was fun to see the members going around and fooling with each other naturally--- Nino&#039;s time spent with Haruno didn&#039;t even feel forced as they have surprisingly good chemistry with each other.<br />
<br />
(2) Momo and his mom&#039;s interactions sparked up lots of plot holes to the story. Why is he scared of his mom? Why doesn&#039;t he want to live with her? Does he have a trauma? ...So on and so forth. Nobody knows.<br />
<br />
(3) Yuzu and his mom&#039;s interactions also sparked up plot holes in the story. I&#039;d like to know what his family backstory is, but I suppose the anime wasn&#039;t able to put it in.<br />
<br />
(4) Nino&#039;s love for Momo, a childhood friend from 6 years ago is relatable, but annoying if it&#039;s done in an anime. Her love for him was over done, and if I was &quot;Yuzu&quot;, I&#039;d be fed up about hearing &quot;Momo&quot; come out of her mouth nearly every episode as &quot;Nino&quot; is someone I hold dear. I&#039;d like to see the one I love doing well with the person he likes, but in Nino and Momo&#039;s case? No. Childhood crushes are something that fades away by time. Nino WAS about to move on, but her &quot;moving on&quot; failed, and it&#039;s a very big mistake that turned the tables of romance in the anime. Also, they didn&#039;t even interact much (Nino and Momo), which was something that bothered me. (I&#039;m saying this in an anime-viewer perspective) They mostly relied on their memories of each other and their &quot;longing&quot; for each other, but they weren&#039;t able to make use of the &quot;present time&quot; that destiny gave them. And sadly took the present for granted; such as the ending of the anime.<br />
<br />
(5) Yuzu&#039;s love for Nino. He&#039;s probably the best character in the anime--- cute, tsundere, shy, blushing, and tries to protect her at all times. He even risked &quot;that&quot; just so to stop her from crying (I believe it&#039;s in episode 2). He&#039;s different from Momo despite the tsundere act, and her interactions with her was enjoyable and it felt natural. Befitting interactions for the two main protagonists of the anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment = 9<br />
Despite the plot holes and a bit of the &quot;overused&quot; drama others say, character personalities, and cliches that this anime has; the slow-paced story with well written character development, along with the songs made up for it.<br />
<br />
Overall = 9<br />
As someone who has read over 200+ romance manga&#039;s (some of which I haven&#039;t put in my profile entry yet), I&#039;m starting to find it hard to keep up with reading the same stories, same cliches, same interactions, same dramas that shoujo manga&#039;s mostly follow, and Fukumenkei Noise is such a refreshing breather amidst the cliche-filled manga&#039;s.<br />
<br />
Yes, it may have cliches, but it doesn&#039;t overuse it. Out of all the shoujo romance manga&#039;s I&#039;ve read, they overused the cliches and drama to the point it&#039;s annoying, cringe worthy, and made me lose hope in the shoujo industry. But Fukumenkei Noise is a different one. I&#039;m saddened to say this, but Fukumenkei&#039;s drama is indeed handled very well compared to other shoujo manga&#039;s. I&#039;m sorry that I can&#039;t find the right words to say or explain why, though. However, its drama is on another level out of the other shoujo manga&#039;s.<br />
<br />
I believe that a great anime has to have cliches, but people shouldn&#039;t rely on it alone. We got all the characters, story lines, and plot lines to think about too. But, if we mix in all the idea&#039;s and polish it, comes a great anime.<br />
<br />
I believe that&#039;s all that I have to say about the anime version. I&#039;d prefer Fukumenkei Noise having even just about 24 episodes to fully cover everything, from the little to the biggest plot holes (the anime is slow-paced, but it gets a lot of things done in a short amount of time in huge leaps), but we had 12 episodes to cover. Sadly, the anime wasn&#039;t as perfect as I thought, but it&#039;s still enjoyable as is.

Ok, so that was fucking awesome, for a 12-episode anime like that with a drama, romance and musical genre, so what gives about this anime?<br />
<br />
Very Good 8, Story:<br />
<br />
The plot where childhood friends were at their peak of their sweet friendship when suddenly the boy goes away without saying anything to the girl and girl finds replacement , but was just too loyal to the boy and then several years later in senior high school , she sees him again, but, boy is no longer interested or at least not showing it was maybe annoying, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251436">
        then again it’s annoyingly very good since , one would see the girls struggle to get his boy back through music as the basis of this anime’s plotline. Too bad replacement has be girl’s tool for him to hear her voice.<br />
<br />
Poor 3, Art:<br />
<br />
Ok, so don’t expect to see Nino’s panchira around here, cu’z there aren’t any fansrevices around to see here, but seriously, the art was just too too terrible as if everyone there were suffering from a serious case of bulimia, also what’s with Alice having to wear that medical mask? Could the original creator and illustrator just give her a normal look like anybody else?<br />
<br />
Great 9, Sound: <br />
<br />
Well, you might say that seiyuu Hayami Saori has this owned in a musical aspect, it only goes to show that she can do both song and voice act, beautifully, and the score is for her , btw I don’t a fuck about the other seiyuus.<br />
<br />
Poor 3, Character:<br />
<br />
Ok, the story plot maybe very good, but the characters here were pretty annoying, since the reason for why Momo tries to distance himself from Nino was just too much of beating around the bush, and his character was a dichotomy , were at one point he likes Alice but on the other hand he keeps dissing her away, his charater plot alone was too esoteric , where there is no other girl that would give him a reason to diss Nino nor there were indications that he’s gay, nor does Alice did anything wrong.  Nino on the other hand was this typical obsessive girl who seemly can’t let go of Momo, despite of all the dissing and things that he have said to her , she just can’t let go, also she is as complicated as Momo, but in a wishy washy way , at one point she has given up on him,,,at least for while, but then again she still clings to a hope that her voice would reach him and it did, but not enough to renew their childhood romance. Let’s not forget the replacement, Yuzu whom Nino kinda see as an intruder in her life , poor guy, it seems that he will never be her love interest , also I kinda hate that he has to be this repeater, who has to repeat being a freshman again, his character would have been better off if he is in the same age and year level of that of Nino , too bad since original creator Fukuyama Ryoco have to put his character in a bad situation such as a a repeat student, struggling composer, band  crossdresser (for a while) and a love reject.  Other support characters were I would say, were in their proper places, thought, I’d wish that they were give a piece of their pie.<br />
<br />
Fair 6, Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
I may have enjoyed the songs, but the complications about the characters and their quirks, kind of annoys me, there were episodes I’ve watched , but there were also that I’ve skimmed cu&#039;z of Nino’s overdramatic fits is one reason when there were episodes that she had to act out, really makes me wanna just go to the ending and hope that the next episode would be better and that she gets the hint and just goes for the replacement Yuzu and have a relationship with him.<br />
<br />
Good 7, Overall: <br />
<br />
Nino maybe annoying with his overly dramatic fits with Momo, but then again this anime was annoyingly good, besides it not always …..or at least for this year to that we get to have a kind of love triangle where it involves 2 guys one childhood friend and the other is a replacement, girl loves guy but guy love him too, but in some rocket science reason distances himself from girl, girl on the other hand just can’t get the hint and keeps dreaming to get him back, meanwhile replacement Yuzu loves girl, but girl was just too stupid to fall for him, Overall, this is a reverse of another good anime Fuuka. So will there be another season……………………hummm, don’t expect it, man, cu’z this isn’t an anime that can have one.<br />
