    First of all, I&#039;d like to say that I&#039;ll be giving a normal review this time, no more weird ass insights and comments.<br />
<br />
  HELL WHO AM I KIDDING, here we go, so Boku wa Tomodachi Ga Sukunai NEXT, or I Don&#039;t Have Many Friends. From the name alone you&#039;d think, damn is this some weird ass anime about finding friends? Well, it is, for the most part anyway. For those that haven&#039;t read the damn synopsis - lazy bastards, Haganai NEXT is about our good friends from the neighbors club, namely Sena, Yozora, Rika, Yukimura and the only guy - Kodaka, who think they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review86695">
        don&#039;t have friends (or so they believe) so they stick together and &quot;practice&quot; things that normal buddies would do -they totally have no friends. Now that I&#039;ve got that out of my way, ONTO THE REVIEW!<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
 So like, Kodaka, as you should already know is part of the Neighbors Club, they&#039;re always embarking on funny -and sometimes extremely weird adventures with each other. The story itself seems pretty normal, but the way it&#039;s shown is NOT, it has enough comedy in it to keep me entertained the whole time, laughing my ass off, yet enough plot to keep me hooked on the damn show - something a lot of animes fail at. Horse Heads, Blonde Wigs, Meat, Bald Wig-thingy, and even a Mayo Chiki! references are all included in this anime, I&#039;d say that with all of these things it really, REALLY deserves a 9/10<br />
<br />
  In Short: Great laughs all around but enough plot to keep a viewer hooked.<br />
  <br />
Art: 10/10<br />
 What can I say, I loved the first season, and the second season&#039;s art is even better. No shit I&#039;d give it a 10, the colors provide for a vivid and enjoyable anime watching experience, they blend well and really show the character&#039;s personality off. Just viewing it makes my eyes feel nice, it&#039;s eyecandy bro.<br />
<br />
  In Short: Shit dude, just read the actual Art rating, it&#039;s pretty short - Vivid and Enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
 This is probably because I&#039;ve grown too used to the voice actors, but I&#039;d say they make the characters sound the same as they look. The chatter between characters is a pretty big thing here, and the voices of the characters really play a large role in the comedic scenes, like &quot;voice imitations&quot; and sound effects. I don&#039;t skip the intro, meaning it&#039;s pretty good. I would have given it a 10/10, but I feel that it&#039;s lacking something, so for now the best I can do is a 9.<br />
<br />
  In Short: The voice actors were chosen well and the sound effects really aid in comedic scenes.<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
 Now, for me, there are a lot of things that make a comedy better, one would be perverts. They&#039;re the butter (bread and butter, it&#039;s the butter) of comedy, whether it be Nikaidou Arashi from OniAi, or Kirche from Zero no Tsukaima, they always provide for a lot of laughs, that&#039;s where our resident perv-I mean scientist comes in. Boobs, would then be the bread, allowing jokes to be made about how large the characters mea- I mean breasts are, or how small and neglected they look. Obviously, we&#039;re missing an integral part of a harem - the childhood friend, but have no fear, because Yozora appears! Yozora, (one of my favorite) the weirdest of the club, is also Kodaka&#039;s childhood buddy (Season 1), and also creates most of the jokes/parodies that appear in the anime. Being the only guy, Kodaka would obviously be the center of attention - A.K.A. the harem boy, and as usual he doesn&#039;t even notice (lucky asshole). Lastly, what would a comedy be without the<br />
 unsure-gender-person Yukimura!, (well it gets solved but whatever). The large amount of  comedic potential in these characters are MASSIVE, and they&#039;re, well in my opinion used properly, not just throwing in excess characters that would usually make things funnier, but actually make things worse.<br />
<br />
  In Short: All the characters you would expect from a Harem-Comedy anime, the perv, the boobs, the guy, the childhood friend and the gender bender, but used to their maximum potential.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
  Friday, friday gotta go home on fridays. Extremely hilarious, amazing characters, there was never any doubt that I would give it a 10 in enjoyment was there, I mean I did mention how funny I found this anime, didn&#039;t I? Finishing each new episode leaves me craving for more, what&#039;s the new skit? what&#039;s happening next?<br />
<br />
  In Short: wake me up when the next episode airs<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
 Now, before you go on blabbering about how it doesn&#039;t deserve a 10, I&#039;d like to say that THIS IS A REVIEW, by ME, not by YOU, god damn it people. Boku wa Tomodachi Ga Sukunai NEXT, overall is an amazing show, it may have some minor errors here and there, but it&#039;s still an enjoyable watch. I recommend you pick this series up and follow it as it goes. cheers

    Édit: Honestly I don&#039;t like this show that much like I used to, But I leave my thoughts on how I liked it back then. <br />
<br />
Boku Wa Tomodachi Ga sukunai NEXT or Haganai Next,  abbreviated, is one of those anticipated sequels almost everyone who saw the last season was waiting. After the amusing and fun time at the Neighbors Club we get a new season full of laughter, emotions, confessions and more. In which really I wasn&#039;t expecting to be more developed in that way than last season. which it is one of the main parts that are going to be analyzed here.<br />
<br />
STORY =

          <span style="display: none;" id="review91461">
        8<br />
<br />
The story continues were the first season left. A new year at the Neighbor&#039;s Club in which we see the 7 members of the club sharing and spending time together trying to make friends. The story in this season is very developed in the way that the characters seem to mature more. At the beginning we encounter the sillyness in which the first season characterized the show, DOING ACTIVITIES AS A GROUP! But as we get going with the show we see that the characters are trying to fullfill the purpose of the club and trying to actually be friends and not just being a group of people in a school room. <br />
<br />
The story, to describe it, is not that epic or amusing. Yet it is very intense with the truths and face to face confrontations in which everyone gets into. Also to add that it is more realistic to demostrate the feelings towards each other. Instead of only making fun of them and doing this great use of innuendo, sexual jokes and harrasment in which  the first season showed A LOT.  Also that the story really progresses and doesn&#039;t stay as an episodic anime as it was demostrated last year. It is fun and you can get caught into it. Making it  very easy to absorb.<br />
<br />
<br />
ART = 9<br />
<br />
The art is admirable. The touches of bright colors give great effect in the series&#039; presentation. It gives the impression that is alive and vivid seeming almost real. Specially the touch for the design of the characters, the main parts. For example the eyes of every character specially Sena, Maria, Rika. It feels that they can watch into your soul. Also the hair  color for Kodaka, Kobato and Yozora make the reflection is given to their hair. Plus the color for the characters&#039; skin, cloth and every trait that they have, it is outstanding. But also the important fact of where is taking, the scenario. The scenarios are a real portrait of the real live theme parks, parks, schools and even the room seem to be taking with exact detail to be animated. It is really gorgeous.<br />
<br />
<br />
SOUND = 5<br />
The instrumental pieces are not that good for me. Starting with the opening and ending. Both I found them very childish and just really annoying. Making it sound very irritating to the ear. But if we see the series of how it is, they are well incorporated to story that they want to tell. <br />
<br />
The Ost isn&#039;t also that outstanding. It is very common for a series and doesn&#039;t have any instrumental piece that I could be hearing over and over to remember that it is from Haganai. It is very standard. Maybe the only exception would be the &#039;&#039;YOU GOT MAIL&#039;&#039; Ringtone of Kodaka&#039;s phone. But the rest of it is just average.<br />
<br />
The voice acting is incredible. The actors give real life portrait to the characters and match with their personalities very well. Specially Sena and Rika whose voice actresses talk and they bring them to live. The one that I hate is Maria&#039;s actress which is very stressful with that pitch voice. <br />
<br />
CHARACTER = 9<br />
<br />
This is the part that admire the most of Haganai Next.<br />
The characters are very well developed in this season. They give them something that was left in the first series and it was character and personality. Because on the first series they were very cliche characters and fight against each other for that reason. But here they have grown up and try to make their desire and club purpose together.<br />
<br />
Starting with Kodaka Hasegawa, the  often mistaken delinquent. It is very conservative, serious and easy going. One of the founders of the club. Here, he continues with the same characteristics but he develops himself very well, until the end of the series. Because of this he doesn&#039;t confront anyone but for this trait he loses a lot with their mates, because it turns himself into a coward and running away from others. This character I find him just normal and very average, it doesn&#039;t add something but with some series like this, there must be a guy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then we have Yozora Mikazuki. She has changed in many ways first with their hair and then with the discovery of her childhood friend. She is very aggresive and a tomboy. This character is very complete and she&#039;ll give the spectator good reasons to laugh and follow her track. This character I found her very well done characterized  by the producers. Because with the discovery of his friend she tries to keep going althought at the same time being inmature for only that reason. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sena Kashiwazaki has to be my favorite character of the series. She isn&#039;t just your typical stereotype of Blond and Giant boobs that almost every anime contains. She is a character with  intelligence, rich and mature girl. She  portraits her desires to be strong and be together with everyone, except Yozora. This character is of my taste because is determinated to accomplish her goals with courage and hard work. In this series we see how her father is very influential in her life and a daddy&#039;s girl. But what I love most of her is her &#039;&#039;AHO&#039;&#039; yelling to Yozora in their fight without a doubt. Without both of them the show is nothing.<br />
<br />
Rika Shiguma. She is one of  the characters that outcast the most. Her development is very rich. Also she doesn&#039;t stay as the nerdgeekfreak of sexual thoughts and yaoi mind. She is self-centered in the things that she has to do and also she focus to find friends among herself. She is very distinguished in this series because she changes her clothes and uses a different look in every situation not like most characters in series.<br />
<br />
Then our Male/Female character Yukimura. Very Cooperative and Loyal to Kodaka. (I use &#039;&#039;it&#039;&#039; for the review because I know what gender is) It is another character whose real self will be discovered but will keep the same affection to its room mates. It is a flat character with almost the same expression and voice tone to everyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
And finally our two lolis, Maria and Kobato, the fight of good and evil, well not exactly. But those almost make my day with their Heaven vs Demon&#039;s Brawl and fight for whose belief is better. They are very entertaining and sometimse they demostrate their cuteness. ~ku ku ku~<br />
<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT = 8<br />
<br />
Haganai Next is very entertaining against its prequel. It simply grows up as a show. Taking away the overuse fan service that almost make me puke and don&#039;t watch this one. But here I enjoyed it because I laugh with cute sillyness and not dirty mind and double sense jokes like its predecessor. <br />
<br />
The confrontations of the characters give  good drama going. Plus reveals and puts us on the characters shoes and we feel their empathy. <br />
<br />
Also with the inclusion of the characters such as Kate and Aoi give a nice touch to the series.<br />
<br />
The only bad parts that I found are the characters&#039; past not yet shown. Just Yozora-Kodaka childhood but others not. Like why Yukimura is like that? or what did Yozora did after she left in her childhood? Those answers that are unknown. The other one the ending of the series is just very abrupt the ending for the way it is. But I hope and pray for a 3rd season to come out to clear this up as soon as possible. This 2 things are what I have problems with, the rest is enjoyable. Although I don&#039;t see it that strong to be classified R+.<br />
<br />
<br />
OVERALL = 8<br />
I recommend it, if you survived the first season as I did. It is funny, dramatic with a good presentation, very well animated with great voice acting, and story. So you will really enjoy it if you are looking for a short show.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for those who have read this review and sorry if I had  grammar issues. English isn&#039;t my mother language.<br />
<br />
MEAT~MEAT~MEAT.

    From friendship to romance, things get a little more serious on Haganai NEXT. As the relationship between Kodaka and all other girls reaches another level, new feelings are shown... It&#039;s love... But how can Kodaka deal with that? Afterall, he never stood in a situation like this before, where someone actually falls for him... Would he be able to face it and tell what he really thinks about that?<br />
<br />
Usual activities from Neighbour&#039;s Club still occur and it&#039;s main objective didn&#039;t change, at least, for Yozora... If it was really accomplished, there would be no reason to keep the club active... None of them wished that,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review116809">
        so acting like they haven&#039;t made any friends yet seemed the best choice...<br />
<br />
But would this be the only way to end it all? Yozora, Sena and Rika slowly begin to fall in love for Kodaka... Sudenly, it turns out to be a romantic comedy! As a girl and a boy become friends, there is no reason for both to get closer and be more than that. A real couple should care for each other and having a normal relationship is the first step on approaching someone you like... However, other friends may not know how to react or  may have feelings they also wanted to show... Things can get weird and everything can fall apart instantly... Haganai NEXT is deeply related to real life by handling all this frindship X love subject...<br />
<br />
The small group of friends from Neighbour&#039;s Club remained untouched, as no new additions were made. Yet, new characters are introduced, despite those only relating with Kodaka. Yozora, Sena, Rika and Yukimura also start to aim on being alone with Kodaka... He pretends not getting what they all really meant... He&#039;s affraid of having a deeper relationship with any of them...<br />
<br />
Ending was left open, so we can expect a new season coming out soon! Cheerful OP, like the last one, but I liked first season&#039;s ED better. All this friendship stuff is complicate... Mixing it with love is way worse... Obviously, it&#039;s almost certain that dating someone will hurt another one&#039;s feelings... That&#039;s what we should watch out for... So let&#039;s just have fun, as friends!

    Ah, another season. It&#039;s been over a damn year since the original Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai debuted and seemingly, I almost forgot some of the events and giggles from season 1. Well, I remember some memorable moments but let&#039;s cut to the case here. Season 2 of  Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is here at last. It&#039;s time to once again see what the Neighbor&#039;s Club like to do during their every day lives.<br />
<br />
And I know that there are a lot of ways people like to enjoy during their leisure time. Some people likes to watch anime or read manga. Some people likes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review91315">
        to discover a new hobby. Some people likes to hang out with friends. Some people likes to go travel. Then, then are some people who lacks friends and wants to make some in order to live out their short and miserable lives It&#039;s especially not easy to make friends when the look on your face represents one that looks like a delinquent. It feels like you&#039;re the new kid at the block and everyone holds some sort of aversion towards you. Luckily though, there&#039;s this club that can remedy your alienation. It&#039;s called the Neighbors Club.<br />
<br />
Yes, it&#039;s back! It&#039;s season 2 of Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai (also known as Haganai)  This is the direct sequel of the original season that debuted in Fall of 2011. It&#039;s been over a year and here it is once again with the Neighbors Club. The series is based on the light novel of the same name written by Yomi Hirasaka. The series details the activities of the Neighbors Club and how they live their every day boring lives. They don&#039;t have friends but they do have themselves and each other. With that, let their days of fun begin.<br />
<br />
First of all, what is the Neighbor&#039;s Club?<br />
<br />
Generally, the Neighbor&#039;s Club is a group of people founded with the purpose of making friends at St. Chronica&#039;s Academy. The academy is located at Catholic School and many of the students there views the main male protagonist as a foreigner, a delinquent, and generally someone who seems to be a troublemaker. Of course, this is a misconception and misjudgement. In fact, Kodaka isn&#039;t there to make trouble. He&#039;s there to make friends and with the Neighbor&#039;s Club, it makes the purpose of just that.<br />
<br />
The series retains its small cast of main characters who are all members of the Neighbor&#039;s Club. Besides Kodaka, the main male protagonist of the series, there is Yozora Mikazuki. She is seen as a girl who is egoistic, bitter, and a degenerate who seems to enjoy the idea of bullying. With her cold blooded personality, she lacks friends. It is not until she meets Kodaka and the other members of the Neighbor&#039;s Club that she decides to open herself more. Yet of course, she retains not only her shorter hair (from the first season) but also that dangerous and manipulate personality of her&#039;s. As a matter of fact, she is able to twist events, dialogues, and certain circumstances to fit within her liking. This is especially true to Sena, Maria, and most of the other members of the club.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, Sena retains her personality as well. Although not seen as manipulative or cruel as Yozora, her arrogant attitude makes it difficult for Sena to make true friends. And of course, that&#039;s why she&#039;s a member of the Neighbor&#039;s Club! Nicknamed as “meat” by Yozora, Sena continues to enjoy the habit of playing ero games (sometimes with others). Her rivalry with Yozora still retains its amusement as the duo often battles it out in many outrageous contests that has mixed results. (usually in Yozora&#039;s favor) <br />
<br />
Among other members of the club includes the lovely self-proclaimed mad scientist Rika. Her physical appearance takes a delightful change for fans but behind that lab coat is still a girl of the same personality. Rika&#039;s love for eroticism and her own perverseness often gets her into many strange circumstances. In fact, her strange personality even becomes an hassle for Yozora to handle at many occasions. Odd one out, she&#039;s the most peculiar member of the club.<br />
<br />
Then of course, there&#039;s Yukimura who acts like a girl, behaves like a girl, and is... a member of the Neighbor&#039;s Club who adorably addresses Kodaka as “aniki”. Yukimura plays the role of a very feminine person, one who wishes to bring out the womanly side with the help of the Neighbor&#039;s Club. It&#039;s quite amusing to watch especially as Yukimura seems to be the most ordinary member of the group as well.<br />
<br />
The remaining two members of the club makes their appearances occasionally but every chance they encounter each other turns into a war of debate and argument. On one side, there&#039;s Kobato (Kodaka&#039;s younger sister) who often co-splays as a vampire with heterochromia. Then on the other hand, there&#039;s Maria who portrays the role of a nun at the very Catholic School the club is founded in. That&#039;s about as clear as oil mixed with water. In fact, the duo never seems to get along and gets into countless brawls. Yet at times, they seem to enjoy the fun of the Neighbor&#039;s Club because what do you know..they&#039;re also there to make some friends. Hopefully.<br />
<br />
The series follows its traditional episodic format. In fact, some of the episodes have two different stories that are divided between each other. Nonetheless, the story maintains its lighthearted atmosphere and what it&#039;s like to have fun with the daily activities. Some of the activities in the show is portrayed to bring out comedy and laughter while others seems to bring the club members closer together. Among some of these activities often includes some sort of way a member can manipulate events and strategically allow them to reach certain desired outcomes. Of course though, there are also fun activities the group enjoys altogether and hopefully get some of the same feelings of hanging out with &#039;friends&#039;.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the series still suffers various problems. The characters themselves may be seen as fun and interactive to watch but lacks any sort of real development. In fact, there is not much development at all. The continued repetitive gags and rivalry between some of the characters also becomes a bit bothersome to watch. Then, there&#039;s that whole debate among fans on which girl is the “best”. Otherwise, the series seems to continue to avoid some serious drama related to events from the past regarding Yozora. In fact, at times, it seems the series just wants to have fun rather than extending the reality of story. Well, the series isn&#039;t realistic anyways since the show itself is based on this Neighbor&#039;s Club with such events in real life that makes it seem impossible for a group of students to hang around like that. The gap between fiction and reality here is just too large to fill. Among other problems, the series seems to have this unsettling mood involving many of the overused tropes. It takes its main theme of &#039;making friends&#039; and turns it into a way that lacks real development. At times, the mood of the series becomes serious while other times immediately shifts to its typical mood. Although Kodaka and Rika received decent personalities from this sequel from my point of view, the rest of the cast also seemed a bit off balance.<br />
<br />
The animation retains its original cutting edges and presentation. There&#039;s not many change except for a few twists involving the physical appearances of the club members. In fact, one of the club members isn&#039;t the gender who you may originally predicted. AIC (Anime International Company) does their job at mediocre for this sequel, the same way they have done for some its other works involving the school life theme.<br />
<br />
As for soundtrack, the series makes it balance with the lighthearted rhythms. Tom-H@ck who demonstrates some of its skills makes the series&#039; music in a way that is fun. Yet at times, the music is almost like a child&#039;s play for viewers&#039; ears because of its repetition and stereotypes. The way the OP song plays the lyrics “Be my Friend” is a parody of the club as none of the members seems to be actual friends. Rather, it seems that they are just there to make their miserable lives a little better. However, I will say that it is quite catchy. BE MY FRIEND. Three words that can sum up the major theme of the series.<br />
<br />
Overall, this anime is an amusing watch although there are many times when things don&#039;t connect together. For now, I&#039;ll give the score of a “8”. With the weak plot progress as well as characters&#039; development, this sequel seems to sway away some of the audience. Despite this though, Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai NEXT still has its fun touches. Of course, in real life, having fun with your friends is one of the most enjoyable moments youths will experience. Whether at school or at home, friends are treasures that are valuable. It is this series that gives them a fun meaning and seeing the club members of the Neighbor&#039;s Club does that. At many other circumstances, the Neighbor&#039;s Club gets into those bitter arguments that makes its member seem more like enemies rather than friends. Well are they actually friends deep down by heart? Hmm, I hope so.<br />

    Yes, yes yes you better believe it, almost all the reviewers of this anime give this a 10/10.<br />
<br />
Just to give you the reader a hint of how popular this 2nd season of &quot;Boku&quot; is...<br />
Just earlier today (at the time of writing), at a certain anime streaming site. In less than 24 hours since the subbed version was uploaded to the site. Episode 11 received more than 100 fan comments on the page, AND almost 200,000 views, all in LESS THAN 24 hours from 1 SINGLE anime streaming site.<br />
<br />
That is simply the most number of views I had ever seen happen on an anime that quickly.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review90495">
        For the haters of harem comedy, I really hope they can check this vastly popular anime out.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------Story (10/10)---------------------------------<br />
&quot;Next&quot; is the 2nd season of the &quot;Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai&quot; anime series, not only is it way better than the 1st season, it is the BEST harem anime I have seen to date. Story continues from the first season as Kodaka carries on the day to day adventures with his friends from the neighbour&#039;s club in school. However through brillant writing and character development every single day of the neighbour&#039;s club is a absolute riot to watch. You&#039;ll always be laughing and giggling at the characters conversations, happenings and adventures.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------Characters (10/10)---------------------------------<br />
A HUGE charm factor of this anime has to be the female cast, especially in this 2nd season. Not only is there a new addition of a charming sister in Kate. The hairstyle changes to two characters, Yozora and Rika. As well as constant costume changes to Yozora, Rika and Yukimura, bring out so much appeal and &quot;moe&quot; to the screen that it is almost impossible not to get dumbstruck each time one of their new &quot;looks&quot; debuts on screen.<br />
<br />
Part of the charm of the female cast this season also came from the deeper connections that the male lead (Kodaka) develops with the girls. Like in any harem anime, the girls start to discover that they love the main guy character. And since the guy is trying to be oblivious to their feelings, each of the girls try to appeal to him with cuter outfits and more feminine gestures to get his attention. You get shy wayward glances, tsundere type embarassed denials, extended eye contact with puppy eyes, everything that can make a guy gulp and hold his breath in his throat. So much romantic tension builds up throughout this anime that even his own younger sister gets swept up into the flow.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------Art (9/10)---------------------------------<br />
Part of the &quot;moeness&quot; of this anime comes from the amazing animation work done on the female characters. The new costumes, hairstyle and colours look absolutely stunning on the girls. With the standout example being Rika, changing into yet another breathtaking look almost every episode.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------Enjoyment (10/10)------------------------------<br />
What are you waiting for? &quot;Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai NEXT&quot; is a masterpiece of a harem anime that cannot be missed. Millions of viewers around the internet are waiting eagerly every week to catch the latest subbed version of this anime. Saying this anime is simply popular would be a HUGE UNDERSTATEMENT. I highly doubt there will be many viewers who remain not entertained after watching all 12 episodes of this anime :)

    Be My Friend Shiranai furi shitatte <br />
Be My Side Zenbu kidzui teta yo <br />
<br />
Haganai NEXT......Finished, frankly I don&#039;t know what to say about this anime&#039;s last episode and it was quite a disappointing that it ended in a cliffhanger, ok, so no more beating around the bush, how do I rate this anime, well, here&#039;s how:<br />
<br />
Story: Good 7.<br />
<br />
Since this was the continuation of the previous season, it still follows the same plot but with a couple of revelations along the way. Except of course with the romance genre, things are starting to heat up as the members of the &quot;Neighbor&#039;s Club&quot; are now competing for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review91969">
        the guy&#039;s affection be it directly or indirectly, which btw studio AIC Build has left us wondering as to what happens next, now that 2 new competition has arrive in the anime........ a little bit late that is. <br />
<br />
Art: Good 7.<br />
<br />
Ok, for the most part, there seems to have been some changes with the character&#039;s illustrations, ok so Yozura&#039;s hair is short given that she had it cut from the previous season. But, the changes I see has something to do with the uniforms, from the previous season the girls wore the a matching green skirt and green blazer, now they don a plait skirt and cardigans , well for the main cast the this. It would have been nice if this anime&#039;s illustrator be consistent, since the girls do go to St. Chronica Academy, instead of cardigans, maybe they should&#039;ve wore the school&#039;s standard green blazer and it would have been nice for once to see Kobato in her compete middle school uniform, also, I don&#039;t dig as to why Yukimura now that she was confirmed to be girl would still be in a boy&#039;s uniform. The consolation here is that we get to see Rika in a whole new different  form from a geeky girl to a hot babe and we also get to see Yozura&#039;s more hotter in plain clothes, only to change into wearing a track suit. But what make this anime&#039;s art good was the seemly part where the female cast are going commando.<br />
<br />
Oh, I still hate the way how Kodaka was illustrated, pretty obvious that illustrator  Shōichi Taguchi has no idea what a typical western delinquent would look like. Frankly, Kodaka looks more like a dork than a bad boy.<br />
<br />
Sound: fair 6.<br />
<br />
I simply like the opening theme, but for Kate&#039;s voice doesn&#039;t seem to match her character, since according to info she&#039;s 15, but her seiyu sounded like 20, in that case director Toru Kitahata should&#039;ve cast her as a twenty something adult, instead of a teenager which make it difficult to understand why someone in her age is a nun.<br />
<br />
Character and enjoyment: Good 7.<br />
<br />
The characters still maintains their usual roles except that we don&#039;t get to see anymore of Sena do the usual Parting Shot Fit....you know where she would say &quot;AHO, AHO, YOZURA, AHO, BAKA , BAKA WAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!&quot; and then she dashes out, you have to admit it was very funny, in fact episode 8, I&#039;ve wish that Yozura would have done the same thing when she dashes out of the room and saying &quot;AHO, AHO, SENA AHO, BAKA, BAKA, WAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!.&quot; Also, it was very funny that Yozura get her share of getting grilled and we see that Sena was getting the upper-hand and that&#039;s what makes it enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Overall: Fair 6.<br />
<br />
Thought for the most part, this anime did provide the laughs and the gags, though I would have like to give this anime a 7, was the fact that it has an open ending it left us audience hanged and wondering if there will be another season or does writer Yomi Hirasaka and Misaki Harukawa  wants us to focus on the manga, either way it is up to us audience to wait and see.<br />
  <br />

    Let&#039;s make this short. After the first season I thought that it&#039;s going in the right direction, but it&#039;s not. As to plot, in the first season there was SOME plot and overall end goal, but now it&#039;s all gone. It&#039;s basically series of random events, themes, cliché stuff based on other chinese cartoons, put together for the sole sake of finding friends. And dude, it&#039;s not even funny anymore. Characters are as flat as it&#039;s possible just like the plot. As to art and sound they are on a very decent level. To keep this short I&#039;ll just add that I don&#039;t know how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review87063">
        could I go through 6 eps doing my best no to fast forward them all the time. There are many better shows to watch, but I guess it&#039;s watchable if you find yourself having lots of spare time.

    Well, this is my first review. So.. uh.. here goes.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve watched the first season and the second season today. (Well, I became addicted with the series actually.) Haganai NEXT stands as the improvement of the first season, but the ending of the season wasn&#039;t really what I had in mind... and pretty much, for those who watched this. <br />
<br />
The storyline was going so well for me, and I hate it when the episodes I watch buffer. However, the thing that stood out was the ending. Like I said, it wasn&#039;t the best ending. Abrupt, so I&#039;m expecting a third season right around the corner. I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review188771">
        could&#039;ve given a 9 to the story, but the ending was a downer. Positively, a harem romantic comedy where the main character is dense. That isn&#039;t new in anime. But, he changed at the end. He ain&#039;t the Taka everyone once knew, and I liked it. <br />
<br />
The characters were the standouts of the this season. At the first season, I haven&#039;t seen the potential of the characters. This season, we see the evolution of the Good Neighbors Club. The bond is stronger, and a harem formed in this season. Last season, it was more of just Sena and Sora. Yukimura, from the maid to being a butler (guess the reference), and Rika finally brings Taka to his senses (no more dense MC). The standouts of this season were Rika and Sena.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the series. I stopped watching the first season because I found another anime that stood out (Nisekoi). After watching, I tried other anime such as Mayo Chiki, The Pet Girl of Sakurasou, and other kinds of Romantic Comedic anime. I watched the first episode of the first season, and after about 10 hours, I finished watching both seasons. I hate it when the video buffers and there were laughs, especially during their amusement park ride. There were happy and sad moments, but it never failed to enjoy me.<br />
<br />
Overall, I liked it. Like the first season, the anime had an abrupt ending. Haganai Next is the improvement and evolution of not only the characters but the series as well. Since it ended that way, hopefully, we see the 3rd season. A lot of questions are already on my mind regarding what will happen with the club and I&#039;m looking forward to the day the next season will be released. I hope the anime improves more, and so far, it has been one of the best harem series I&#039;ve seen. That&#039;s a plus.

    Who would of thought making friends is hard? Other than that, there&#039;s a club for that! Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai Next also known as Haganai Next is the second season of Haganai. For those who haven&#039;t seen Haganai, you should consider it. Haganai is a great rom-com. Haganai focuses more on comedy rather than romance, but the two mix very well. A brief summary for those who wants a recap without spoilers: Kodaka just wanted to make friends during his high school year, but he struggles to make friends in his first few month in school.  What can Kodaka possibly face? There is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review101699">
        no problem when there is supposedly one guy and a bunch of girls together in a club right!<br />
<br />
Another great year for The Neighbor&#039;s Club! Would Kodaka ever achieve his goal? Forget that, The Neighbor&#039;s Club will fix that. The Neighbor&#039;s Club started small, but it grew into a big active club. Kodaka is surprisingly popular with the girls! He is the only guy in the club with six other girls. As everybody in the group wants to make friends, the girls started to have feelings for Kodaka. <br />
The shift from season one to season two made Haganai enjoyable. There are more spotlight of other characters rather than Sena and Yozora. We still have the same comedy, but this time around, there will be more of romance. What I like the most from Haganai is the jokes they use. They may be common, but the staff put the jokes in perfect timing with the scenario. A good example would be... instead of explaining it in words, have a picture: http://imgur.com/a/25P25 . Other than that, I wonder who would win in this harem genre? <br />
<br />
The art style is pretty. I may be biased, but I do love characters that are well drawn with beautiful eyes. Anime has changed throughout the years, and I have to say that I prefer the art style now (modern times). The colors they used is thoughtful too (http://i.imgur.com/0GAJfBH.gif). Each character is unique in terms of art style. You have Kodaka, a dirty blonde hair color. In Japan, a boy with that hair style would be shown as a delinquent. It gives insight rather than having those out of color hairstyles like pink, blue or green (not saying that I hate them, but I do love pink hair). There are also characters that are lolis and moe is definitely included (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fsHFTZLxYM).<br />
<br />
The opening and ending is pretty good. They have a catchy tone to it. The opening is significant because it foreshadows what is going to happen in season two. The ending is what I enjoy the most. I watched it during when the anime was airing, and I just had to watch the ending and then the preview. I just couldn&#039;t skip it. The ending is just cute or kawaii in it&#039;s own way. Other than the OP/ED, I didn&#039;t enjoy the audio too much. The OST isn&#039;t amazing. If I were to compare it to Shingeki no Kyojin, their OST is better by far.<br />
<br />
The character are all likeable. People just have strong grounds to have a best girl. My favorite would be Kobato because she is the best. There is no need trying to argue over me. Just kidding; everybody have their own personal preferences. The character development from season one to season two got better. It shows more of who the character is and their objective in the anime. There are also gags in the anime which is pretty good considering that Yozora and Sena are rivals. Sena has the attitude of being the best, but Yozora tries to confront that attitude. Other than the main characters, the other club members are Rika, Maria, Kobato and Yukimura. Kobato and Maria are the lolis of the show. Rika is the mad scientist and Yukimura is the loyal servant. Rika wants to make friends at the club, while Yukimura wants to fulfill the samurai&#039;s code.<br />
<br />
To end this review, I have enjoyed the anime and believe other people should watch Haganai. There are many other great rom-com, but Haganai is somewhere in the top 50. The enjoyment throughout this anime is pretty good. I watched it straight away once it got subbed. The jokes that were used were clever. I would recommend watching Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru (or known as OreGairu) and Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru (or known as Oreshura). These anime are all similar as having a guy in a club full of girls. Other than that, there are clever jokes in each anime. All of them also have a romance feel to it. See you next time!~<br />

    A pretty standard romcom with all the standard tropes. Protagonist has a harem but the main focus is the love triangle between him and the other 2 main characters.<br />
<br />
I liked the art and sound. It&#039;s nothing special but it looks good nonetheless, there&#039;s nothing that stood out to me as unpleasant.<br />
<br />
In general I would say this anime is more romance/drama than comedy. It has its funny moments but i&#039;d say the main reason for watching this is the drama stuff, lewdness and love plot, if you&#039;re into those kinds of things. The second season has more drama and does push the love triangle aspect a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308632">
        lot more than the comedy angle if you compare it to the first season.<br />
<br />
The character writing annoys me more in this season than the first season. Kodaka is still the indecisive dullard that ignores his surroundings, but it gets even worse. He&#039;s constantly pretending he can&#039;t hear anything in this season and it gets really damn annoying. The one thing they got right was making Sena have a stronger personality. Originally she was a doormat that never stood up to Yozora, and in this season she seems to have come out of her shell a bit and stands up for herself. It&#039;s one of the aspects of character development that they did perfectly in this season.<br />
<br />
(Spoiler alert) <br />
<br />
Towards the end of the season, Sena actually confesses her love for him. In the first season I found Sena kind of lacking, but in this season she actually starts to stand up for herself and isn&#039;t afraid to tell people her feelings. Of course Kodaka (being the paperweight he is) runs off and ignores Sena and the rest of the club very rudely. Rika finally confronts him about his cowardice but even after all of that, it still seems like Kodaka hasn&#039;t learned anything. The season ends with Kodaka approaching Sena but ultimately saying nothing to her as they find out that Yozora, in her typical self-centered fashion, has &quot;gone on a journey&quot;.<br />
<br />
On the topic of love triangles, this anime doesn&#039;t ever resolve anything. The love triangle exists throughout the entire anime to titillate the viewer, and nothing more. It felt like there was actually a degree of plot progression this season. The love triangle starts to become lopsided as Yozora is constantly incapable of approaching Kodaka. Not only that, but Yozora also paints herself as a very underhanded and somewhat sociopathic person in this season. She&#039;s constantly trying to cheat to get an upper hand over Sena when it comes to Kodaka. She tries to rig a game so that she can kiss Kodaka but when Sena ends up winning anyways, she calls the game off. She tries to write Sena out of the play and make her a villain, and when Sena calls her out on her shitty behavior, she storms off and says some REALLY mean thing to Sena about how she wishes she never met her. Yozora has transformed from a cynical tsundere girl to a sociopath and a bully, and it&#039;s almost sickening. This is an anime about a club created for making friends and Yozora is doing the exact opposite of that. It honestly disturbed me how all of the other characters let her sling her insults at Sena and nobody says a damn thing about it or even remarks on it really. Ultimately as the season progressed I found myself more and more disgusted with Yozora and rooting for Sena.<br />
<br />
The plot really takes a nosedive at the end of the show, and viewers are right to be angry with how the writers chose to sloppily end the season. It felt cobbled together and lacking cohesion, like nobody could decide on how exactly the show needs to end so they took the laziest route.<br />
<br />
What started out in season 1 as a dramatic romcom with heavy usage of tropes has devolved into a melodrama with a weak protagonist that refuses to grow up and a love triangle falling apart at the seams. The comedy is all but nonexistent this season and the drama is unpalatable due to the poorly written characters. This anime does not deserve a third season with the way it resolved everything in the final episode.

    Boku Wa Tomodachi Ga Sukanai. Yes he didnt have any friends at first, but now i dont know if i can call this as friends or in harem mode, but he is oblivious to relationship anyways. Will make my review short.<br />
<br />
Story 7/10: It&#039;s funny as usual, far better than season 1. Swear words are back, some indecent scenes are shown, wow. But what brings me down is the last episode, what a cliffhanger ending.<br />
<br />
Art 8/10: I say it&#039;s acceptable to the viewers.<br />
<br />
Sound 8/10 : What? I just like the OP. It&#039;s so catchy though everyone might not agree on this. OP song composed by Tom-H@ck

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186945">
        who also composed on K-on!<br />
<br />
Character 7/10: If you watch this series, you will know how they behave.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10 : Watch after you watch some sad,feels anime series, this will brighten your mood fast like me. Well maybe recommended to those who already watch season 1.<br />
<br />
Recommended: Those who love fanservices and bigboobs and harem ;)<br />
Not Recommended: Opposite as what i stated above<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10

    So let me start off by saying that I really enjoyed the first season of Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai and came to this season with roughly the same expectations. I&#039;m sad to say it but this second season was a real disappointment. For those that have already watched the first season already and are continuing to the second, I won&#039;t tell you not to watch it, just remember to keep your expectations low.<br />
<br />
Story (5/10)<br />
<br />
Well the story was never really a main point for the series anyways. The goal of the club was to make friends yet it&#039;s obvious that they aren&#039;t even trying to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review106761">
        accomplish that. What usually happens in every episode is they&#039;ll &quot;try out things that popular people would do&quot; as practice for real life situations. While I was never really interested in the story, I&#039;m glad that this season still retains its bits of comedy which really sold the first season for me. One of the annoying points of the story was the fact everyone in the club refused to acknowledge each other as friends. Kodaka repeatedly brings up the fact he &quot;has no friends&quot; throughout the series. Seriously? After all you&#039;ve been through in the club, you don&#039;t consider them your friends? <br />
<br />
Art (8/10)<br />
<br />
Nothing to complain about from me here. The art is still of the same quality as last season. <br />
<br />
Sound (8/10)<br />
<br />
So I really liked the opening and ending songs enough that I listened to them most of the time and wouldn&#039;t skip them, which is what I usually do when I watch anime. Not sure why I liked them so much, but they&#039;re really catchy and upbeat. It feels like they compliment with the feelings the show brings out. <br />
<br />
Characters (5/10)<br />
<br />
This is where a lot of my problems lie so I&#039;ll start off with the positive points first. The three new characters introduced didn&#039;t get much time in the series but I thought they were all likeable. Kate plays the part of Maria&#039;s overly protective and siscon older sister. Aoi is Sena&#039;s class rival who always comes 2nd to her in exams and she is extremely jealous of Sena but Sena never notices her. Hinata is the kindhearted and popular class president who Yozura despises for being the epitome of a popular person. Yukimura is still Yukimura, as devoted and likeable as ever. As usual Maria and Kobato fight with each other like little kids which can get kind of annoying at times, but towards the end of the series you can see that they really like each other. <br />
<br />
There were quite a few negative points to the characters as well. Rika constantly making passes at Kodaka and getting rejected gets pretty overdone and bland as the series goes on. Sena and Yozura&#039;s fighting continues throughout the entire season and every time they fight one of them ends up almost crying. I can kind of tell that Sena doesn&#039;t really hate Yozura all that much but Yozura seems like she&#039;s driven out of pure malice. Kodaka continues to blatantly ignore anyone in the club that tries to ask him out because he doesn&#039;t want things to get awkward in the club. While I can sympathize for him, I feel he should just flat out tell them his feelings cause ignoring all of them isn&#039;t gonna work forever (as you&#039;ll see). Overall its obvious that there was hardly any character development and they act the almost the same way to each other as they did in season one. <br />
 <br />
Enjoyment (5/10)<br />
<br />
So I had a hard time enjoying this season for reasons given above. It feels like in every episode the characters just repeat the same arguments and actions over and over again. While there were bits of comedy mixed in that added some enjoyment to the show it couldn&#039;t make up for how annoying the story and character interactions were. If I hadn&#039;t watched the first season of Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai then I certainly wouldn&#039;t have had it in me to finish this season since it was so painful to watch. <br />
<br />
Overall (6/10)<br />
<br />
So I&#039;m not happy about it but I&#039;d have to give this season a 6. The story picked up straight from season one but it just wasn&#039;t able to give me the same level of enjoyment that I experienced from its first season. The character interactions got to be really annoying to the point I want to scream at them to just shut up and get along with each other. While the Art and Sound were of the same quality as the last season, the Story and Characters just fell flat and left me seriously disappointed. If you&#039;ve already watched the first season I feel you should know what you&#039;re getting into and buckle up because its gonna be a bumpy ride. <br />

    I really enjoyed this sequel but just know that it has a somewhat ridiculous ending.  My Girl Friend and myself watched both the first and second season of this show and we loved it.  I am a much more serious business man, and she a nurse.  Her favorite thing in life is a good laugh, which can stop so many fights.  Sadly I have never been one for humor, I take everything and break it down logically.  Even with that when we watched this together I was on the ground laughing.  If you or your significant other are big

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182297">
        into humor and you want a cute date night anime this serious is amazing.  My only real complaint is the ending.  It does end in a cliff hanger, and like so many other anime that end in cliff hangers I had to start suffering a couple episodes before the end because I started to tally up all the things they needed to wrap up and realized their was not enough time.  Not only do they not wrap up those things but throw a lot more questions on top as they end.  A pretty big one 15 seconds before the end too.  But I would still give it a 9/10 because of how damn funny watching these was, even to the end it still had some funny parts when it got serious.

    How to write this as spoiler free as possible. If you haven&#039;t seen season 1 yet, don&#039;t read this, will probably spoil alot of season 1. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai Next does, is really just speed up the tempo of the series. It&#039;s in depth a harem series, but it&#039;s also depicting the more sad part about the harem series genre. The fact how the boy in the series, is eventually burdened with being forced to break up his group of friends, to make a choice. Who do he choose? <br />
<br />
Do he choose the totally beatiful Kashiwazaki Sena, who brings his family greater

          <span style="display: none;" id="review90467">
        respect, who has been a friend even from a very young age. With her strange interesting hobby&#039;s, and her skill of using her powerful family name to break enemies. <br />
<br />
Do he choose his best known childhood friend Mikazuki Yozora, who he has had hard time adapting to as a potential love interest, but still give him some moments where he truly see&#039;s her beauty. <br />
<br />
Do he choose Higuma Rika, the nutty professor, with all her charming quirks and obsession with boy&#039;s love. Cause hello, who doesn&#039;t think she is perverted in such a way, that you just can&#039;t laugh. <br />
<br />
Do he choose Kusunoki Yukimura, the boy, girl, something, that just begs for his recognisition. For him to be her, &quot;samurai master&quot; or husband if you prefer. <br />
<br />
This is what makes me love ga Sukunai. It&#039;s so hard to tell who to choose, and that makes it exciting all the way until the end. <br />
<br />
In general not a must watch per se, but if you want a harem anime. Then it&#039;s a must watch. <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading my short synopsis.

    Since this is my 1st ever review, lets make this short...<br />
<br />
Something made me not to watch this anime up till 8th episodes and I really regret it now... Yep, waiting for another week for this anime is one of the enjoyment because it give me chance to talk about one episode each week with my buddies.<br />
<br />
Now then, enough about my regret, here comes the review:<br />
<br />
Story : 6/10<br />
Fair enough.<br />
<br />
Art : 9/10<br />
The art is totally nice. Not perfect, but it does deserve 9/10.<br />
<br />
Sound : 9/10<br />
The OP &amp; ED fits the anime perfectly, the background sounds help brings out the comedy.<br />
<br />
Character : 10/10<br />
Characters are actually git gud here.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review88803">
        In a hilarious way.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 10/10<br />
See you next week??? Yes. The comedy is killing me with laughter and more than that so it really deserve 10/10 for its enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Overall, its 9/10<br />
If you think this anime is bad, then don&#039;t watch. And don&#039;t blame anything to me because I give a rating this high...

    It&#039;s difficult to rate this, because I lost interest in this anime years ago, and just now finally swung around to finish the last several episodes.  I think that, in and of itself, speaks volumes about the problem with Haganai NEXT and it&#039;s final episodes.  I&#039;m not exactly sure why they decided to completely change the format they had going from the first season and first half of NEXT, but it was a big mistake.  <br />
<br />
Haganai, at its best, was wildly hilarious.  It managed to blend the typical harem anime with some really solid humor, with a slight touch of raunchiness

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264503">
        to it.  The characters were also very likable, outside of Yozora.  I didn&#039;t hate Yozora, but I didn&#039;t like her all that much, either.  Everyone else, however, I really enjoyed.  Even the straight man MC Kodaka, which is rarely the case.  <br />
<br />
But, for some reason, they sucked almost all of the humor out of the anime in the second half.  Haganai NEXT suddenly tries to get serious in the second half, and it completely fails for a multitude of reasons.  The biggest of which is the paradigm shift the characters suffer.  Yozora goes from being Tsundere to just being a total jerk.  Rika shifts from being an irredeemable pervert to some kind of a emotionally wise sage.  Sena bizarrely goes from being a spoiled goof ball who is the butt of the jokes, to pretty much just staying glued to her games, until it&#039;s time for the finale.  The others, including my two favorite girls, Maria and Yukimura both see their lines dramatically reduced.  <br />
<br />
But, worst of all, was the finale.  It&#039;s bad and unsatisfying. The entire build up to the finale was weak. What should have been the most intriguing episodes turned out to be the most droll and meandering storyline wise. <br />
<br />
Overall, I feel like I could&#039;ve just dropped this anime instead of keeping it around to watch later for the last 4 years.  It&#039;s a truly disappointing ending to what was a hilarious anime series.  <br />

    Great anime. The characters are pretty defined and they all have their own story and distinct personality. I loved the jokes, the artstyle, the fanservice without it being too much or too obvious, good stuff. <br />
<br />
One thing to get off my chest though, I&#039;m really tired of the whole *girl mumbles something* *guy asks what she said &#039;what was that? what did you say?&#039;* *girl says &#039;nothing, never mind!&#039;* bit. Especially in this second season, the girls always say stuff that clearly show their interest in Kodaka, and he NEVER hears their mumbling and they always make up excuses as soon as they realize he

          <span style="display: none;" id="review157903">
        didn&#039;t hear them. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s fine once or twice, but this happened all the freaking time. As usual, the guy is completely and utterly oblivious to the advances of the girls. I guess the bit before a relationship is always more interesting, and the plot of the show is making friends, but it got a little annoying in the end. <br />
<br />
Regardless, this show was hilarious almost all the time, loved it!

    Personally I think this anime took a turn in the right direction. It went from this hilarious &quot;romantic&quot; comedy that was pretty ridiculous in the first season, to a real romantic comedy that toned down some of the ridiculousness in favor of plot and character development. It still has the same comedy and all of the same assets as the first season, but with more seriousness and just overall progress. Which I Love.....except for that ending.<br />
<br />
Story- The story is alot better in the second season than the first season, because it actually has a &quot;story&quot;. In the first season it feel too episodic, meaning that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review92477">
        it didn&#039;t feel like it had a direction or set path, almost like the episodes could be viewed in any random order and you wouldn&#039;t notice it. However the second season is nothing like that. I really like this change of pace, because the characters seem alot more dynamic and less linear, and there is actual progression between all of the characters. It feels like it has alot more romance in it and just feels alot more thought was put into it than the first season. My one and pretty much only gripe about the second season is the ending it has. It had everything going in it&#039;s favor and then that massive disappointment of an ending. The third season is definitely where everything will really go down, and you get a peak of that, but it feels way too much like a cliffhanger. If I had to compare the ending to another ending I would compare it to rosario+vampire, which is now in second place for worst cliffhanger ever. I really loved the story line and how it was compose, and I love the new direction this anime is taking, but I feel that cliffhanger ending is holding it back from being better. As of now it&#039;s a 7/10 as a whole for me, but if a third season does come out (oh please god let one be on the way!) then it will easily go up to an 8/10 or possibly even a 9/10 if it plays it&#039;s card right.<br />
<br />
Art- The art style is the same as ever. If you liked the art style of the first style then you will love the art style of the second season.<br />
<br />
Sound- The sound is great in this anime. The opening really fits the overall theme and just syncs with what the anime is all about, as well as the ending theme.<br />
<br />
Character- The characters were already really good in the first season, but after the end of the second season they are on a whole different level. The characters really do change alot during this season and really seem to grow for the better, except maybe one person which is left unclear whether or not it was bad or good what she done. By the end of the third season the characters will be the same, and yet drastically different in key areas.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- To be honest I wasn&#039;t expecting much out of this anime when I first started watching it. I was expecting it to be in the same format as the first season with no real progression and just more hijinks, but I was presently surprised with how it started going and was hoping for it to end good, and that wish was half granted. It&#039;s still as funny as ever, but it seems to have more direction and character development now, and seems to be taking itself more seriously. With alot of anime i&#039;ve watched that where in the same category as this, they always seemed to get worse in the second season and the overall quality of the anime would lessen, but not with Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai. It seems like they wanted to be taken more seriously, but stay the same somehow, and they definitely accomplished that. It was extremely enjoyable for me and I am eagerly awaiting the third season to come out. I haven&#039;t been this hyped for another season of an anime in, well forever.<br />
<br />
Overall-Overall the second season was a huge surprise to me, in a good way. I&#039;m so glad it decided to take the direction and tone it took now, personally I think it&#039;s for the best. I&#039;m having high hopes for the third season which is where I think all the really important stuff is going to happen. It was a really fun ride with a rather abrupt stop that I think wasn&#039;t executed all that well, if it wasn&#039;t for that sour and distasteful ending it would have easily been ranked an 8, but it just left a sour taste in my mouth. If you watched the first season and aren&#039;t sure whether you should watch this season then I highly recommend you do. Alot does happen in the second season and the characters change quite a bit, but if you can&#039;t handle a major cliffhanger then you might want to wait until the third season comes out and finishes.

    Im writing this review because Im disappointed how the whole thing ended. In a nutshell the series is very good, and I mean VERY good. You will basically laugh from start to end mainly because masterly written characters. BUT there are two things I cannot forgive which in the end droped this sezon score down the on the bottom.<br />
<br />
***Minor spoilers ahead***<br />
First thing is the ending. I mean.. WHAT? So bad and opened ending is not acceptable even if the story still isnt completed (manga is still ongoing). The last episode seems like &quot;filling&quot;. Yes, there is this awesome fight on the roof with really emotional

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178475">
        conclusion, but otherwise?? EH no good I tell you, no good. It seems like our main character Yozora is no more important, so we can just dump her with no explanation and final headlines. END.<br />
I can thing only of one anime which had worse last episode and it was Mayo Chiki! It is funny that in this anime there is even reference on Mayo, so maybe the author inspired himself and did some crappy ending in the favor of that also unfinished romance.<br />
<br />
I mean what is the point of watching this series really? It only drives you mad in the end. You will love the characters, love the setting and suddenly it all ends .. ends.. nothing more.<br />
<br />
Second thing I hated was this indecisiveness of the main protagonist Kodaka. I mean really? He has only TWO phrases to response to a girl who tries to help him or say she has crush on him, and with that I mean: Oh sorry didnt hear ya, the game is too loud. OR even worse He simply runs away. So dissipointed. In the first season was Kodaka so much better of a character, his deliquesnt like approach even if he didnt want it, and now he is crybaby who runs away in the slightest hint of emotions.<br />
I will again use reference to another anime - the only worse protagonist in his stupidity is Raku from Nisekoi.<br />
So in conclusion, what is the meaning of this I ask?? Why those characters who are so much fun and well writen in casual situations so much suck in the emotional moments which should be main part of this anime. I can thing only of one thing . Author is really bad and dont know how to deal with it. He is not able to write deeper emotional moments but he wants to have it in the show.<br />
<br />
WELL, overall score will be 7 because I really laugh my ass out almost during the whole series BUT I cannot go higher due to described reasons.<br />
For the characters I wanted to give straight ten due to Rikas awesome progress and overall good char settings but Kodaka blew it last few episodes. 8/10.<br />
<br />
PS: If the rest of the manga will be converted into anime we will all cry, because the ending and final desicion of main hero (who will be his love??) is mindfuck. It only confirms my statement that the author dont what what he is doing.
