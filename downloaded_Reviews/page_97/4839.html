    Imagine a teenage girl so traumatized by her perverted father that she develops a phobia of males. This girl is brave enough to transform that fear into a positive motivation - to attend an elite college and obtain an independent career where she can support herself in the absence of family. <br />
<br />
But Ao-chan is not allowed to have that level of agency. Her ambition is instead made secondary to a forced, awkward, unnatural relationship with a popular teenager of unreal pureness who is a continual source of anxiety. This is to the detriment of her studies that are sacrificed at the altar of fickle teenage

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310899">
        romance. The more she participates in romance, the lower her ambition to establish independence becomes. <br />
<br />
It is problematic that this anime presents Ao as a character who must change herself to accept that men are a necessary component to happiness as a teenager. As if a boyfriend is something that she needs to obtain in order to be whole, when in reality nothing was really missing to begin with. She just wasn’t ready for a relationship at her age, and that’s fine. But according to this anime that is not fine. So we’re subjected to misunderstandings about phallic instruments, forced and awkward sexual tension, extreme anxiety and hyper-erroticism that is skewed towards the male gaze.<br />
<br />
Some of the greatest romantic narratives feature partners who are equally prepared for a relationship and have as much to lose or gain as the other party does. There is then a mutual level of understanding between them and they grow through their experiences with each other. But in this narrative Ao is very clearly the one changing the most as a result of her relationship, undeniably for the worse, while stale male kun is for the best. He gets to date the super sexy socially awkward virgin girl who only shows her fun side to him. She is sacrificing her academic career to the extent of failing every single subject while stale male kun is shown to have no such decline. <br />
<br />
Perhaps I would be willing to forgive this push for Ao to sacrifice her studies if the anime were entirely satirical of romantic pitfalls and never took itself seriously. I am not an unfun curmudgeon who doesn&#039;t appreciate humor -  for some episodes that were entirely silly and focused on secondary characters (such as the sardonic best friend Miyabi) I was able to forget how offensive the premise was and chuckle at the absurd situations the characters found themselves in. But when the tenor switched to being dramatic, or the comedy was at the expense of a teenage girl who wants to be free of her family, is when I was reminded of the reality that Ao is actually being pushed by her degenerate father to hook up with an unknown boy before she’s emotionally or mentally prepared for it at the sacrifice of future outlook. More creepy than it is cute or funny.

    What is love?  I think it&#039;s a complicated thing, how can someone not be complacent because of that.  Some people have experienced this and teenagers are in this complicated situation.<br />
<br />
Is the Japanese anime industry in a crisis?  To be honest, I also don&#039;t know about this but there are several factors that can prove the truth of that opinion.  If from my point of view most Japanese anime has a theme that is so simple.  What I mean here is why don&#039;t they make a masterpiece with a story full of drama?  Forget about that, now the anime world

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310896">
        mostly has a romance comedy theme because the two themes are popular with various groups.  One of them is &quot;Midara na Ao Chan Benkyou ga Dekinai&quot; Having an honest comedy romance theme, this anime is perfect, but there are several factors that make this anime even more perfect.  The jokes followed by the &quot;ecchi&quot; genre make this anime even better.  The excitement and funnyness of this anime from each episode is very interesting why is that?  There is no doubt that the three genres have proven how interesting this anime is especially among men.<br />
<br />
Focusing on a girl named Ao Horie who lives her daily life just by learning but one day her classmate named Takumi Kijima changed Horie&#039;s daily life, which at first only studied now became diverse.  In each episode they do things like high school students in general but these things will definitely lead to a misunderstanding.  Don&#039;t think that this anime is similar to the one outside because if you look at each episode that is displayed it is very interesting and makes you not feel bored.<br />
<br />
It doesn&#039;t matter how good the storyline is, but it is like a spoon and fork if the storyline is not balanced with good image quality, it will be one-sided (come on, this is an anime).  Did the anime industry experience that path?  I don&#039;t know why such questions are still imagined in my mind but as an audience I honestly do not care about the problem that I am concerned is whether they can still continue the work they are working on on their own?  It&#039;s not just being abandoned.  This time the presentation of the manga, I honestly do not know the ins and outs of this one anime, for some reason I did not find in some websites, but Silver Link made a bold decision because they have adapted a manga that is rarely highlighted to become famous.  This studio has done a lot of various anime made famous by him and with the name of the studio maybe their sales also go up.  The art here in my opinion is standard and as usual there is nothing special.<br />
<br />
When compared to art, maybe this is equally important as a car, if the animation interpreter is a machine then this is the wheel.  The voice actors are very good because they try to make sounds that are different from the age they are playing and in my opinion it is an extraordinary thing.  But what stands out most in this section is the opening theme of the anime itself, how does the opening theme become an example of an anime.  Having an opening theme that is liked by various people is a difficult job but here they get it. It is proven that the songs sung by Edoga Sullivan managed to seize the attention of many anime lovers.<br />
<br />
Love?  Actually it is a complicated expression of feeling even though the word consists of only two words but it takes a lot of effort to say it.  Who should express these words?  Is a man?  Or girl?  I don&#039;t think that is an important thing, as long as one of them succeeds in saying these two syllables, I am sure they must understand a word that covers everything.  Expecting something after saying these words is of course a natural thing and in my opinion it is a reward for having made a hard effort.  This story illustrates this where they expect each other but the hope contains only nonsense but they try to cover up the shortcomings.  No wonder having shame and anxiety because their hopes are only nonsense but this is a characteristic of each character.  Ao is a girl who is perfectly smart and also beautiful but she has shortcomings in love, while Kijima is also like that even though he is not how smart.<br />
<br />
I can feel everything from sadness to happiness here.  Overall, this anime has met the criteria that are good even though I also do not know the meaning of the criteria that I meant earlier, but if you have watched until it&#039;s finished you will understand the meaning of the word criteria.<br />

    I&#039;m gonna write a review as human as possible. I won&#039;t make any arguments.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story 9/10: The story is quite attractive. I promise you all ecchi fan. This is going to be fun. But, sorry there is no extreme fanservice there. It&#039;s all about one natural born hentai dere girl who meets the kindest boy ever. I can&#039;t say he is a man because he is too stupid to become a man. You&#039;ll know what I mean.<br />
<br />
Art 7/10: Seven is my average score. Nothing problem.<br />
<br />
Sound 9/10: OP and ED was catchy as hell. My most favorited song this season.<br />
<br />
Character 8/10: In the most of ecchi anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311605">
        you may got this kind of cliche; &quot;lucky bastard boy MC&quot;, &quot;fake-innocent boy MC&quot;, or &quot;real pervert  boy MC&quot; who will always get paired with one or more beautiful innocent/deredere/mature/thot girl. What people usually say to them is; &quot;the MC is trash&quot;, &quot;this show is garbage&quot;, etc.<br />
Here we have the kindest boy in ecchi anime ever with adorable and cute Hentai dere girl. I bet you won&#039;t be able to hate the boy MC (except for being too pure lol). Unconsciously, you&#039;ll ship them.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9/10: This anime is very enjoyable. Thanks to 12 min duration. If this anime have longer duratuion, i highly doubt it would be enjoyable.<br />
<br />
<br />
I&#039;d love to give 10 for the score but i&#039;m afraid it could be overrated so 9 is fair for me. I recommend this anime, especially for Ecchi Comedy fan.<br />

    Yo, girl.  Show ‘em your A-O-face!<br />
<br />
“Meow…meow?” — Ao Horie<br />
<br />
“Nice…” — Harrison Yates, South Park cop<br />
<br />
How simple misunderstandings evolve into salacious predicaments.  Although, Ao-chan’s suspicions could precipitate from a subconscious desire that wills her into suggestive positions, despite her conscious rejections.  Considering that she routinely thinks about embarrassing scenarios involving Takumi Kijima, it’s likely she secretly longs for a lustful relationship with him.  Whatever the case may be, “Ao-chan Can’t Study!” is quite amusing, in spite of its childish, unrealistic antics.<br />
<br />
The humor relies on Ao-chan’s wild imaginations and awkwardness.  Essentially, Ao-chan overanalyzes her prearranged plans to ‘break-up’ with Takumi to the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307232">
        point of flustering herself with nervous anticipation.  Invariably, this leads to erotic gaffes where Ao-chan ‘presents’ herself to Takumi; which, surprisingly — at least, to Ao-chan — he implores her to exhibit modesty.  Yet it doesn’t derail Ao-chan from holding inconsistent beliefs that Takumi is a devious, sex-crazed individual who aspires to get into her pants.  Hence, the inadvertent eroticism serves as a perpetual gag for the writers to reuse (sometimes ad nauseam).<br />
<br />
Entrusting the success of a comedy centric show to a singular setup is risky business, but “Ao-chan Can’t Study” succeeds more than it fails.  Particularly because it captures the essence of teenage angst in a manner that is palatable to the audience.  Laughter permits openness to subjects that can be considered ineffable in the high school milieu.  Thus, allowing the viewer to establish a connection with Ao-chan and understand her inner tumult.  And while the situations themselves are artificial (for the sake of the ‘joke’), they resonate with the viewer because every person has experienced the discomfort of saying or doing the ‘wrong’ thing.  Because of this ‘connection,’ the jokes feel intimate.  Which makes them all the more hilarious, save for a few duds every now and then.

    I have watched tons of slice of life and many romcoms and this one is WAYY better than most out there. I&#039;m grinning ear to ear and laughing at this show the overwhelming majority of the time I&#039;m looking at it. The way MC thinks and the fact she thinks all men are trash makes this show a lot better and sets it apart. Watching MC figure out about all these unknown things is great and made a lot funnier because of what she expects. I find the fact it&#039;s from the perspective of a girl while being Ecchi to be a relatively unique perspective

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307624">
        for the Genre and really enjoy it. <br />
<br />
This show is absolutely hilarious. There are some really wholesome parts too. Some times REALLY CUTE &lt;3

    In any typical human non-perverted mind that is constantly filled with Ecchi goodness, I can say that this short is a safe bet between the lines of the &quot;Benkyou ga Dekinai&quot; (or &quot;people can&#039;t study&quot;) and the rom-com subgenre. Because what you see, an Ecchi WILL ALWAYS be Ecchi, whether subtle or nein.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, I am Ao Horie, as in...&#039;Show ‘em your A-O-face!&#039;&quot;<br />
<br />
Imagine such a parent that would give you SUCH obnoxious names, only to ever silence your future life, in school or be at work. That&#039;s our female MC&#039;s dear Ero of a dad, likely said the most worrisome dad to ever have, Hanasaki Horie,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310888">
        author of erotic novels (such as Promiscuous Lament, 100 Words of Significance in Bed). And his physical properties (which resemble Inuyasha&#039;s Myoga, EVEN similar in terms of pervertedness) give off the high warning senses to stay away from. Alas, Ao herself in the process, develops high evasiveness for the boys in her school, for fear that her father&#039;s influence (plus sex) may overpower at any moment.<br />
<br />
And in comes the male MC we never thought that would help our female protagonist sort out her issues, while being at her beck and call, he just doesn&#039;t give in. Takumi Kijima, Ao&#039;s classmate, who harbours a crush on her. Even at the expense of Ao and him being together, and the &quot;sex&quot; hijinks happening to favour him to her, sometimes it&#039;s so weird to think at how this doesn&#039;t work each and everytime (but the audience all ye knew).<br />
<br />
But Kijima was a character whose naiveness I didn&#039;t like, to the character that despite Ao&#039;s attacks, he respects her space and tries to work out the issues together, if the intention ever comes that he is &quot;man&quot; enough to be called Ao&#039;s significant partner. Yes, his character&#039;s there for tons of stupidness, but towards the end, his heart for Ao is really justified (with the &quot;Benkyou ga Dekinai&quot; part), and working for their happiness together. NOW that is maturity despite lustfulness and temptations at every nook and cranny (something which most of us have been through at one point).<br />
<br />
Plus, having rivals (such as Miyabi) to create some mindless competition is...erm, baseless? Miyabi is like a suporting character that could be easily thrown away, if not for her mindless flirting towards Kijima (of which Horie is definitely NOT a fan of).<br />
<br />
Moving forward with the other parts of the short...<br />
Silver Link is a studio of mediocrity standards, with lots of misses and occasional hits, and I can dare say this series falls in the latter (of course, that depends on your tastes). Art and animation doesn&#039;t hit where it belongs, but more or less, it gets the job done at the tons of exposition for the central characters, supports and all. But by taking this gamble, I&#039;d say they did a decent job.<br />
<br />
Over on the sound department...<br />
Other than the BGMs that &quot;encourage&quot; the sex-intensifying rom-com moments between rivals and partners,<br />
The OP is a head-banger! I thought with this series it&#039;s gonna feature some bad music, but this ultimately proved me wrong, and is my OP of the season, dead-set from the outset. A song that sounds catchy with the setting it is provided with. The ED is also good too. Overall, astoundingly good, that can knock someone&#039;s feet away.<br />
<br />
It pains me (with a smile on my face) to say that this series is really worth your time if you want some simple ecchi-glorified goodness that doesn&#039;t trade in with much time spent. Because all it does is more than its demographics of men wanting sex (much less the opposite gender&#039;s desire), but it spends time producing situations so intimate and relatable for us to understand. What a show this is, hilarious (save for some puns) and wholehearted, you could find elsewhere with varying qualities, but none so good than this.

    How... Utterly average this series is. You could mistake it for any number of similar romance-comedies. Nothing about it stands out, nothing about it is unique and to be perfectly honest, nothing about it is particularly FUNNY.<br />
<br />
Stupid misunderstandings (usually about perverted topics,) a perverted old man mascot character, a handsome, kind-hearted senpai all the girls seem to love, two characters being in love but still somehow failing to properly realise they both want the same outcome... I mean, it&#039;s just copy-pasta in anime form.<br />
<br />
The art is acceptable but certainly nothing to write home about. The sound is pretty much the same, I&#039;d be hard pressed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307230">
        to call it bad, just incredibly average with nothing remotely unique about it. To describe it in a few words; mass-produced, generic and cliche to the extreme it almost seems intentionally bad.

    An ecchi rom-com in the viewpoint of the girl? With humor deriving from decent writing of situations rather than cheap fanservice shots? Sign me the F up. While it has all the tropes of what you would expect in a typical rom-com, I don&#039;t think that necessarily deters viewers who like this genre. The 12-minute-long episode format does the show justice because cliche plot threads are explored in a fun, zippy way. <br />
<br />
I personally can relate to our lovely MC Ao-chan because I went through schooling focusing on just studying without giving any sort of romantic relationships any chance. Her tsundere tendencies also make a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308267">
        lot of sense given how she&#039;s been raised and we as viewers understand her better than other tsundere girls since we know what she&#039;s thinking (not that I don&#039;t love my tsundere characters, but that characterization can get annoying real quick if not done well). <br />
<br />
It&#039;s a nice change-of-pace that the girl is the perverted one in the story as much as Ao-chan denies it. The struggles of repressing those secret desires and projecting them on people she believes are &#039;normies&#039; gives way to all types of ridiculous scenarios that play not only in her head but in the real story as well. Give this a go if ecchi rom-com shows are your thing!

    I really think some of the negative reviews on this anime are a bit unfair or they looked at this a bit too seriously and judged it WAY too early. So I decided to make this my first review in hopes I can persuade a couple of people to give this anime a shot. <br />
<br />
I would call this anime a coming of age story where the MC, an adorable, naiive girl, tries to discover what the difference between love and sexuality is as her feelings of the two often mixes when a boy is thrown into her life. This show does a fantastic job of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321093">
        jumping back and forth between the two emotions. It is witty, entertaining, and sometimes head ache inducing since the characters can be quite dense. But in this story, the denseness actually makes sense vs a cheap gag that is always thrown in other Rom-coms that I have seen. <br />
<br />
The characters are set at the very beginning. There is no drama. Just a story of a girl falling in love with a boy and doing so in such a cute and positive manner. This is definitely one of the most wholesome shows that I have seen. Yes, there are some moments where you wonder what is wrong with the father, but he is only trying to teach in the only way that he knows and most of them are comedic gags anyways.<br />
<br />
That being said, I give this show a 9/10. The story is very well told and stays true to the manga and doesn&#039;t skip anything. The character development is very strong and you get attached to the two characters very easily from the beginning. The humor is really good, from the misunderstandings, to the ecchi moments, and to the gags that are thrown around. Not to mention the opening song is very catchy! So give this anime a shot and stick with it to the end! It is a very wholesome show and it is a shame that it has such a low MAL Score.

    A guy that doesn&#039;t rush things but is there for his girl, and a girl who is self-aware of what she wants from him and tries her best to be proactive. This anime is much, much better than most of the typical shoujo romance around there. And surprisingly wholesome, for an ecchi.<br />
<br />
- Liked: Refreshing couple dynamics. Not cliche. Above average sound and art.<br />
<br />
- Disliked: Miyabi, as she feels more like a plot device than a character. But with ~10 minutes per episode, I can understand they didn&#039;t have enough screen time to properly develop the support characters.<br />

Art: 7<br />
Nice eye details. Clean art. Simple backgrounds, but everything works together well with the setting. Nothing memorable, tough.<br />

Catchy opening and good ending. Both better than I expected.<br />

The episodes are short and fun, and the romance is easy to ship.<br />

    OK so this anime was not what I expected at all! I&#039;ll be honest I&#039;m really into harems/ecchi/hentai and that&#039;s what I thought this anime was gonna be like but it&#039;s not! Instead I was very pleasantly surprised when I came across a rom com. (pleasantly surprised-- I liked it!)<br />
<br />
This story follows a high school girl with big dreams of getting into a fancy college... so she can get away from her dad who writes erotica and is always embarrassing her. He tries really hard to give her &quot;training guides&quot; and tips on how to have sex. But she just wants to focus on her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321657">
        school. <br />
<br />
The MC is a classic tsundere so if you hate that trope then run far away from this anime. Also I have to say the dad is my favorite character because he&#039;s so funny and very poorly drawn in the most adorable way.<br />
<br />
Have a good day. Get out there and be a weeb :)

    Silver Link did a bad job with this show, a very bad job. First off, the story was bland, and it felt super rushed. It felt very fast-paced. It just was boring. The characters were mediocre. The humor was also bland. It just wasn&#039;t an entertaining show. The art style, the character design, and the music were really good, but thats pretty much it. This show was just very bad. I don&#039;t recommend it. It was awful in my opinion. Its a 2/10 for me. I don&#039;t recommend it, because it was horrible, and it was just boring in my opinion.

    I do like the art of this one, and the plot is quite clear-cut, but the way it is done was not ideal.<br />
Sure there&#039;s comedy and all throughout the series, but sometimes it feels like you got to slog your way through watching it. The character of the main girl is horrible. She goes through such unrealistic thought processes and behaves so awkardly. It just goes on and on and constantly reminds you how ridiculously cliche it is, it gets hard to gloss over it and find it amusing. It just gets frustrating seeing it go on and never really progress. Like who is she

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313549">
        kidding? She thinks dirty thoughts, so everyone else must think the same way too? If she&#039;s the only one thinking that way, how dare the other person lead her on. <br />
<br />
Simply an insufferable female character who thinks guys are lechers and should behave the way she envisions them to be.

    Ao-chan can&#039;t study anime review.<br />
<br />
The series is about Ao who wants to get into a good university so she can move away from her father. Her father is an incredibly popular Erotica novelist and has no intention of hiding it anywhere. As such learning at a young age that her name A comes from apple and O comes from Orgy might not be such a great thing. <br />
<br />
Now as a highschooler she goes around hiding that whilst also having a cold atmosphere. She becomes a loner type person that gets really high grades. You&#039;ve watched anime, you know the type. And this popular boy tries

          <span style="display: none;" id="review398901">
        to talk to her. So you have this relationship of a quiet girl and a forward boy (who&#039;s a virgin).<br />
<br />
Now due to her father she basically thinks all men are sex filled creatures and as such is a source of pressure in the relationship. She even doesn&#039;t like her own father and frankly neither do I. Her father is easily the worst character in the series sexually harassing his own daughter for a gag. It kinda sucks to be honest.<br />
<br />
The male lead is surprisingly different. He&#039;s popular for one thing. He&#039;s not an uber over the top nice guy. He&#039;s just him, and i like that. He feels a person in the series. It&#039;s not someone i can relate with, but he gives off a different enough vibe. Especially near the ending. <br />
<br />
Because of the female leads upbringing she basically is the one that&#039;s thinking of sex all the time. Or thinks that sex is all the boys are thinking of all the time. A lot of the gags base around her delusions and her being horny or her thinking everyone else is horny. And its funny. Some of it isn&#039;t. Some of it is great. It&#039;s like seeing a meme you know. Like definitely warrants some air through the nose and what not.<br />
<br />
The series also temporarily turns into Kaguya-sama for a second. Where the Male lead is desperate to making the female lead fall in love with her. The female lead is desperate to show that the male lead only wants her for sex, so he should do that so she can reject him. Those episodes were pretty funny.<br />
<br />
The romance of this series is also surprisingly fun. The characters are less infuriating than the average romance comedy. <br />
<br />
I think despite the relative fun i had for the series i don&#039;t really consider it anything special. Maybe after i finish reading the manga this could be a must read but as far as anime goes this falls into the fun watch but not must watch section. Which kinda sucks.<br />
<br />
I think with more variety in comedy and bolder characters this could&#039;ve been something real special but your not missing anything if you don&#039;t watch this series. Which might be a bit harsh for the series considering i did call the characters non infuriating like most romcoms, but to be fair., most romcoms kinda suck ass anyway.  I really do hope the manga becomes something special but as for now even though i enjoyed it i&#039;ll probably forget about it soon. <br />

    Ao-chan Can&#039;t Study! is a romcom about a girl who just wants to study in peace without her erotica author father and classmates getting in the way. One of her classmates confesses his love to her and they spend 12 episodes getting into silly situations.<br />
<br />
The comedy revolves around Ao misunderstanding situations (due to being a virgin with excessive knowledge of erotica) and Kijima trying his best to figure out what she&#039;s thinking as they blunder their way through their first love. Some of the comedy tends to be predictable but otherwise I think it was done quite well.<br />
<br />
This series has short 10 minute episodes so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311205">
        it&#039;s easy to binge watch it in one sitting. I think the anime being relatively short compared to other romcoms is a good thing. If this had been full length, they wouldn&#039;t have had enough material to make it interesting.<br />
<br />
The art, voice acting and sound are fine.<br />
<br />
If you want a simple bite-sized romcom with some lewd jokes then you can&#039;t go wrong with Ao-chan Can&#039;t Study! I give it a solid 7.

    I don&#039;t normally write reviews, but this one felt like it needed one. This anime is interesting in a way that it would well fit into the &quot;ecchi&quot; category for the anime audience, but I felt pretty shocked personally. Imagine a high school girl living with a perverted father that her entire mind is solely on the topic of perverted things. It might seem normal to have such thoughts for a high school girl, but she literally only thinks about dirty things. It&#039;s traumatized her to the point that she&#039;s going insane. Personally, I don&#039;t find that very intriguing and I almost feel overly disgusted

          <span style="display: none;" id="review393660">
        by it. I personally had to drag myself through each episode.<br />
<br />
If you are looking for romance with a slight twist, this anime may not be satisfying to watch. If you want to know more about an interesting topic that I discussed above, please continue to give it a watch. Don&#039;t forget though, my review should stand as a warning. I&#039;d say this anime is pretty traumatizing.

    If you want a masterpiece or a life changing experience this is not for you, but if you want a sweet and hilarious romantic comedy to lighten up your mood I definitely recommend Ao-chan Can’t study. I used to be one of those people who had prejudice over 12 minutes anime, Ao-chan is a perfect example on why that’s completely fine in some cases, so fine in fact that you don’t feel it’s a 12 minutes anime, it’s not rushed at all, and actually perfectly adapts over half of the original manga. <br />
<br />
This is one of the few anime I’ve watched that made me cry

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324526">
        from laughing, it’s HILARIOUS, the mangaka and director’s comedic timing is off the charts. The art and soundtrack are fairly good and fits the genre, the opening and ending are delightful, a lot better than many mainstream romcoms. I really don’t know why the score is so low, since the adaptation is actually better than the manga, which has a higher score. The manga is currently completed and this anime adapts until Vol. 05 Lesson 20, it goes up to Vol. 08 and Lesson 36, 42 chapters in full with some extra ones. The manga is as funny as the show and does go a little further on the story, but I feel like  the manga stretched the story a bit too much for no good reason, and in the anime the story wrapped pretty perfectly the way the they did it.<br />
<br />
I often see the same kind of long reviews that say too much and nothing I actually wanted to know. I HATE SPOILERS, but I also don&#039;t want to waste my time with a story that starts great but decays and ends poorly or one where, after all their trouble, the couple doesn&#039;t end up together.. for no reason at all.<br />
<br />
So I thought I should review in a different way, YES or NO answers to the questions:<br />
<br />
- IS THE ENDING GOOD?<br />
- DOES THE MAIN COUPLE END TOGETHER?<br />
- IS IT WORTH MY TIME?<br />
<br />
***If you don&#039;t want to know the answers to these 3 questions you should stop reading right now.***<br />
If you&#039;re like me who just want to know if the story is worth your time, go ahead. So without further ado:<br />
<br />
Is the ending good? YES<br />
Does the main couple end up together? YES<br />
Is it worth my time? YES<br />
<br />
I intend to make my reviews brief, focusing on answering these three questions. If you like this kind of review I try my best to write in all animes and mangas I&#039;ve experienced, so you can see a complete list of reviews next to my name just above.<br />
<br />
Thank you, you&#039;re welcome and peace out. ^^<br />

    This show is a romantic comedy with a focus on ero, but surprisingly without much ecchi. It is about Ao-chan, the tsuntsuntsundere daughter of an erotic novel author, who wants to live alone for university and thus needs to study hard. But, a kind handsome fellow in her class has fallen for her, and is distracting her from studying. <br />
<br />
The majority of the show is basically one long misunderstanding. Ao has deep-seated psychological problems. She misunderstands and/or makes assumptions about her courter (Takumi) constantly, is usually wrong, and never learns from it. Furthermore, she assumes that he is thinking a certain way, repeatedly castigates him

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316992">
        for it (wrongly and incorrectly), and YET in multiple situations, she EXPECTS him to act/think that way - and castigates him for NOT doing so. Essentially, she is a classic tsundere, but with an extra dose of hypocrisy and an inordinately impressive ability to avoid expressing her actual thoughts/feelings. You just feel pity for the poor man: his behaviour is almost entirely above reproach, and yet he is constantly being rebuked and rejected. She wants to reject and throw him away - and then she wants him; she wants him to leave her alone - but then gets unhappy when he does; she wants him to make a move on her - yet reacts negatively when he does; she clearly likes him and he has clearly stated his feelings for her - but she refuses to express her feelings in spoken words. This is asylum-worthy behaviour. <br />
 <br />
Separately, some people seemingly found the dad annoying, but he was alright. Certainly less annoying than the WTF behaviour of his daughter. Why is he a micro-chibi gnome-like creature (a fact that no one seems to comment on)? No idea. As for the male man, I actually liked him; he seemed like a nice guy. I even sympathized a little with Ao&#039;s friend-enemy rival, who directly tells her how annoying her behaviour is (lol), though she is kind of a weirdly cardboard character. It kind of felt like she was there just to make Ao feel superior (since Ao can have everything she wants, with no effort - but doesn&#039;t even care about it).<br />
<br />
Anyway, here&#039;s my classification:<br />
 - Moe: sometimes Ao is a kawaii but this is drowned in instability and tsun<br />
 - Comedy: moderate<br />
 - Drama: plenty<br />
 - Action: none<br />
 - Romance: that&#039;s the story<br />
 - Harem: none<br />
 - Ecchi: little<br />
<br />
I will say that there were plenty of moments where I laughed, so the comedy is not a complete fail. And, if Ao actually acted like a reasonable person to the poor guy, she could have been a very likable character. Her art and design (and basically nobody else&#039;s) were very well done, I think.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve placed the drama high because the story introduces characters to get in the way of the mains (partly via misunderstandings of course), and just generate jealousy between them, in addition to Ao&#039;s unpredictable moodiness. One thing that surprised me was the lack of ecchi - calling this a shounen, ecchi anime (as MAL has placed it, genre-wise), is honestly inaccurate. Just because a show has erotic themes and premises, or discusses such subject matter, does not make it an ecchi show: ecchi usually implies light-hearted visual fanservice, and erotically but not emotionally charged situations. Adult anime with straight-up $ex scenes are not necessarily ecchi anime, for instance. While this show does have some ecchi elements (mostly in Ao&#039;s fantasies, which she wants to come true but also doesn&#039;t[??]), they are usually extremely short-lived scenes or even just briefly flashed, literal still images. Ao gets into a bikini and a tight &quot;teacher&#039;s cosplay&quot;, but this fanservice is quite short. I think it would be easier for this show to go a bit further and simply be a hentai, than it would for it to be classified as ecchi, to me personally. But no doubt many would disagree. (I might just be spoiled by all the great ecchi fanservice shows I&#039;ve seen over the last several years.)<br />
<br />
I should also mention that there is significant character and relationship progression during the show, especially for Ao. However, she never really fixes her severe personality flaws (of which at multiple points in the story she herself is aware). The male main doesn&#039;t change much, though our perception of him does.<br />
<br />
Overall, while this is an amusing show with nice art that I got a few laughs out of, I wouldn&#039;t rewatch it. Ao&#039;s tsun personality, her forced drama-inducing behaviour, her constant unpredictable emotional seesawing, her borderline abusive treatment of someone who loves her... I suspect this show is either written by a woman or aimed at women who like to fantasize about having a kind, handsome man who only cares about her and doggedly pursues her, no matter how much she rejects and slaps him away (even while other, less abusive women aggressively pursue them). There&#039;s nothing wrong with that, of course, it&#039;s just that you should know what it is before you watch it! It is certainly not the simple ecchi comedy I was hoping for. It is closer to a romantic drama with a female high-tsun-low-dere main, plus some comedic elements. I also noticed the show tries too hard (especially near the beginning) to be &quot;realistic&quot;, raunchy, and edgy, which was as cringy as the forced drama and teen angst to me. I guess I just don&#039;t find that kind of thing interesting or funny, but I suspect there are many who might enjoy it.<br />

    Ao-chan Can’t Study is the epitome of a romcom in a short series format done right. Even though it&#039;s a gag show that hinges almost entirely on slapstick comedy to stitch it&#039;s cliched plot threads together, none of its jokes run the risk of sounding repetitive or overplayed. While it is by no means a revolutionary romcom, it might well be the first in the realm of short, fast-paced comedy that doesn’t trade in length for substance.<br />
<br />
But what sets Ao-chan apart from the dumpster pile of typical romances? Allow me to demonstrate by using a scene from the series. In one episode, Ao’s father complains

          <span style="display: none;" id="review353515">
        about why his daughter has only served him a bowl of plain rice for dinner. Ao dismisses him, and begrudgingly reaches out for a packet of MSG, then sprinkles it over his sad excuse of a meal. Her father’s eyes twinkle in excitement, and he wolfs down his “dinner,” visibly satisfied.<br />
<br />
The takeaway: sometimes, all that’s needed to make a story work is to use what’s available, often hidden in plain sight. The answer lies in our female protag, Ao. <br />
<br />
Some might argue that having a female MC in a romcom doesn&#039;t count as a refreshing change of pace (we have the likes of Monthly Girls’ Nozaki-kun and Konobi, after all). But to be served up a romance from the POV of a girl who’s a lowkey perv isn’t only refreshing — it almost feels like a rebirth of the genre itself.<br />
<br />
Be that as it may, I’d like to point out that just like Ao’s packet of artificial flavoring, any improvements to the show are a cheap, last-minute recipe idea and fall short of delivering real romcom umami.<br />
<br />
STORY <br />
<br />
Ao-chan Can’t Study revolves around its titular character, Ao Horie, the daughter of a renowned erotic novelist. She’s named after a Japanese sex pun (aokan translates to “outdoor sex”) and the sound a woman makes when achieving an orgasm. <br />
<br />
In a brief flashback in the opening scene of the anime, Ao shares this erotic tidbit of info as she introduces herself to her grade school classmates. She ends up teased by everyone in school and Ao throws herself into her studies, hoping she can one day enter a prestigious university far from the ridiculous antics of her father. Fast forward to the present day, and lo and behold: Ao is a straight-A student and misguided misandrist (“guys only want one thing and it’s freaking disgusting!”), who would much rather study than mingle with the pretentious crowd of “normies.”<br />
<br />
Everything changes when she’s approached by Takumi Kijima (Ao labels him “King of the Normies”), who takes a genuine liking to her. But Ao’s cloistered and misinformed upbringing lead her to believe that he wants nothing more than to get in her pants. It doesn’t take very long for Kijima’s kind nature to melt Ao’s jaded outlook on men, and she starts developing a distracting crush on him. And this brings the primary conflict into play: the actual title of the show.<br />
<br />
On paper, Ao-chan Can’t Study sounds nothing more than a generic plot tainted by idiocy. In fact, some may immediately write off the series as another sorry excuse for hypersexualized fanservice. I won’t lie, Ao-chan Can’t Study is plagued with light ecchi scenes (it’s what I dislike the most about this show, to be honest), but it manages to turn sex into a relevant plot point by exploring its impact on two curious teens without any experience in bed.<br />
<br />
Had this been any other anime with a standard length of 20 minutes per episode, I would have given this show a harsher score. But since Ao-chan only has a brief, 11-minute runtime, it deserves credit for successfully balancing script, pacing, and character development into a fairly entertaining story. In particular, it uses its compressed episode length to portray Ao in relevant (sometimes naughty) situations that challenge her to identify the difference between lust and love. <br />
<br />
The humor in this show is constructed around Ao’s knack for grossly misunderstanding the concept of sex and how it works, which she uses as a gauge to determine her compatibility with Kijima. <br />
<br />
In the second episode, for instance, when Ao hears a “big hands, big dick” rumor in school, she automatically assumes that Kijima’s athletic persona is enough reason for him to be XL-sized. Later on in the episode, she accidentally grabs Kijima’s hand and realizes how big it is. In a fit of self-consciousness, Ao tells Kijima that her downstairs department simply lacks the space for the size of his crotch. Without chemistry in bed, she claims that they should dash all hopes of their “relationship” working out as early as now. But Kijima assures her that it’s natural for people to have apprehensions about sex, and shares that he has insecurities of his own. <br />
<br />
The rest of the series follows a similar pattern of plot unraveling by way of busting “sex myths”, which serve to bring Ao and Kijima to a closer level of intimacy. The slapstick humor takes Ao’s ignorance lightly, and her overblown and eccentric reactions end up being legitimately funny.<br />
<br />
Score: 6/10<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
The story unfolds from the perspective of Ao, who has lived her life covered by the white noise of eroticism. Her father’s career as a distinguished sex novelist has made her develop a cynical outlook towards men, which she views as mindless creatures driven solely by carnal lust. Even though she distances herself from the “normies” and has no interest in pleasantries, Ao is an object of curiosity among her peers, not disdain. In fact, her classmates look up to her because of her high grades, and this is exactly what draws Kijima to her in the first place. <br />
<br />
As a foil to Ao’s hardened, cynical nature, I found Kijima rather bland in comparison. He’s soft-spoken, good-manned, and too nice for his own good — basically your typical, lovable jock. It’s standard romcom fare, nothing new to see here.<br />
<br />
The distinct contrast in Ao and Kijima’s personalities work, and it makes sense that they’re attracted to each other. But Ao’s persona drastically changes after Kijima tells her that he’s a virgin. <br />
<br />
She automatically uses this grand revelation to her tactical advantage, convincing herself that she has gained the upper hand in their relationship. All of her repressed sexual desires from her childhood come bursting at the seams, and she turns into a sex-starved teen awash with delusions of erotic grandeur. She conjures up images where she subjects Kijima to her wildest fantasies, and devises all sorts of ways to seduce Kijima to get into bed with her. During a study session, she suggestively draws a curved graph in Kijima’s notebook resembling her tits, convinced it would turn him rock hard and go down on her.<br />
<br />
In other words, she turns into the very thing she hates: one of the “normies.”<br />
<br />
I consider Ao’s sexual awakening a double-edged sword. Even though it has given her an obvious confidence boost, it has turned her into someone who looks down on other people simply because they are a virgin. It doesn’t matter if she grew up in a toxic household — virgin shaming is virgin shaming. And it needs to stop. <br />
<br />
Don’t get me wrong: I have nothing against a perverted female lead. It’s exactly what makes this show so much more refreshing than your typical romcom. But an overactive libido and looking down on someone who chooses to abstain from sex (by a potential love interest, might I add) are two completely different things. So different, in fact, because even though we’re a slave to our urges, we can most definitely control how we react to them. And for as long as the world is round, shaming someone for their sexual choices will never, ever be acceptable.<br />
<br />
But for all my frustrations in Ao-chan’s virginity shaming issues, it still can’t hold a candle to the blazing conflagration that is Ao and Kijima’s chemistry. I’ve seen quite a number of romance anime, and there’s no couple as cute as these two (horny) lovebirds. Ao and Kijima are aware of their attraction to each other, and they share a mutual eagerness to please each other in bed. Despite Ao’s raging libido, however, they never really decide to casually hook-up because they’re sensible enough to acknowledge that neither one is emotionally and mentally prepared to take that next step in their relationship. <br />
<br />
Even though the story is rather rough around the edges, Ao-chan still manages to keep the narrative cohesive and well-paced. In fact, the series has a proper conclusion, and it doesn’t leave you in thematic limbo where you have no other choice but to track down the manga to find out how the ships sail. <br />
<br />
Other supporting characters include Ao’s father, who hilariously shifts from a careless, high-pitched voice during casual conversations with Ao to a mature, deep tone when dishing out sex advice to anyone within earshot. The rest of the other folks at school are forgettable, save for Ao’s childhood friend Miyabi who only exists to throw herself at Kijima and cause minor trouble.<br />
<br />
Score: 4/10<br />
<br />
ART<br />
<br />
The art in Ao-chan Can’t Study is amazing, and it&#039;s animated by Silver Link. The only other anime I’ve seen by their studio is Bofuri, and I was similarly impressed by its colors and designs. Each frame in this show bursts with color, giving the dull school scenes a vibrant, upbeat atmosphere. <br />
<br />
But what really makes the art stand out is its realistic and powerful depiction of facial expressions. The art isn’t carelessly done like the brief, comedic chibi inserts in Food Wars, which look like they’ve been drawn at the end of a weekly deadline. A lot of careful detail went into the show’s portrayal of character expressions. And rightfully so, as Ao-chan relies heavily on slapstick/reaction humor for its gags. <br />
<br />
As for character designs, Ao is best described as Sakura Matou from Fate: Stay/Night with better eye art (for real, I only picked up this show because I mistook the poster for a Sakura Matou spinoff). Meanwhile, Kijima reminds me of Mafuyu Satou from Given (seriously, put them side by side, there’s no difference). But despite their similarities to other characters, Ao and Kijima manage to stay distinct in their own right. <br />
<br />
The design for Ao’s father deserves a paragraph of its own, however. Unlike the rest of the characters, he’s portrayed as a funny looking, wide-eyed midget, and the way he’s drawn sticks out like a sore thumb. He sort of reminds me of Kero from Cardcaptor Sakura, but there’s nothing about him that’s funny or cute. He looks ridiculously out of place, and it cheapens the gravity of Ao’s childhood trauma caused by his perverted eccentricities. <br />
<br />
Despite the design inconsistencies, I’ll have to give points for how well-animated and thematically congruent the OP is to the overall theme of the show. Despite its short series format, the OP isn’t just some lame slideshow of its main characters (looking at you, JC Staff) and it succeeds in setting the right tone.<br />
<br />
Score: 7/10<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
The OST for Ao-chan is bubbly and bright, as is expected from any romcom that we aren’t meant to take too seriously. During romantic scenes, however, it shifts to somber, acoustic medleys to set the right mood.<br />
<br />
But the best part of the sound is the show’s opening theme, which is a fucking banger. You know what, I encourage you to stop reading and listen to WONDERFUL WONDER by Edoga Sullivan. It’s addictive and catchy, and I’ve lost count of how many times I had to rewind the OP just to listen to the song. It’s currently my third favorite romcom OP after Rent-a-Girlfriend and Kaguya-sama: Love is War. The ED isn’t quite as good, but it’s just as upbeat as the OP.<br />
<br />
Score: 8/10<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
Ao-chan Can’t Study was a truly entertaining watch. It’s the perfect show to binge on a weekend, and gives me hope that not all short-form anime lack substance or any real plot. If only more shows followed its no-frills storytelling approach by using its limited runtime to its advantage, then I’d have significantly less shows on my on-hold list. Far too many shows drag on with needless exposition and character drama.<br />
<br />
With that said, I’ll be prioritizing other shows by Silver Link on my PTW just to gauge its ability to churn out quality content, regardless of genre. We need more shows like this.<br />
<br />
Score: 7/10<br />
<br />
FINAL VERDICT<br />
<br />
Ao-chan Can’t Study is a short series ecchi romcom that uses its short length to deliver relevant gags that prop up Ao and Kijima’s love-lust relationship. It explores how sex influences the the dynamic of fresh-faced lovers without experience, portraying their apprehensions in an exaggerated yet realistic fashion. <br />
<br />
While ecchi scenes pervade the narrative, it shouldn’t put off viewers simply seeking fluff. After all, Ao and Kijima quickly graduate from their timid, kink-laced interactions and establish a somewhat stable foundation for a genuine relationship by the show’s end. <br />
<br />
FINAL SCORE: 7/10

    Aaa I want to write about a short review here~ ♥ <br />
<br />
Firstly, This anime is very relatable! It&#039;s about a girl who thinks that guys are nothing but ecchi~ And only love ecchi things~<br />
<br />
As a result, When she finds someone getting closer to her, She thinks that&#039;s all he wants and is on his mind..<br />
<br />
She believes because of this, She needs to be ecchi too.<br />
<br />
But what she doesn&#039;t realise is that&#039;s not what she truly wants, It&#039;s all she knows.<br />
<br />
This guy being pure and kind, Kinda teaches her what love really is~ And she gets to know what she really wants, That is love ♥<br />
<br />
It&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313979">
        a journey of a girl discovering love, And, In this world where ecchi things are more and more frequent, and such a thing has become so casual, I don&#039;t blame her for thinking like this.. I surely did, too!<br />
<br />
She gets to slowly slowly learn what true love is, And it&#039;s a truly beautiful thing, And that makes me happy. Feels like I&#039;m looking at myself watching this anime ♥<br />
<br />
Believing in true love, Now ♥
