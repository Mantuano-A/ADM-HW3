    Kodomo no Jikan is a heavily controversial title, and with good reason. But like most controversial titles, its subject matter is not exploited in vain, and the end result is something that can be credited, at the very least, as a decent series in its own right.<br />
<br />
No series has dared to tell the story KoJikan tells and gotten away with it, but for all the underage fanservice it provides, the heartwarming drama beneath the disturbing ecchi comedy ultimately shines. Had KoJikan been solely about the fanservice, this series would deserve all the negative criticism it has received, but there&#039;s a heavy dollop of character-driven drama

        and unique relationships, the context of which have never been explored up until now. One of its more important plot aspects is the recognition of children as having the same emotional needs as the rest of us. It&#039;s a touchy subject, but handled with precision and never crossing the line, though toeing it on occasion. Though KoJikan still handles issues it brings up head-on, it does so in an abrupt and awkward presentation, constantly and abruptly switching between drama and comedy. It may flawed in its execution, but its heart is in the right place.<br />
<br />
Likewise, no series has dared to have characters like KoJikan&#039;s and gotten away with it. This is in great part to the main character being far more than she appears on the surface, especially when her laudably deep and complex emotions are explored. Unfortunately for most characters, they are relegated to often insulting cliche traits substitued as personalities, though this may change in future seasons. For now, the only real depth is in Rin and her cousin Reiji. However, the series should be commended on portraying 8-year-old girls with relative intelligence while acknowledging that they are still physically and mentally children. It&#039;s territory anime often skips in favor of taking the &quot;moe&quot; way out and its nice to see a series that portrays kids as kids.<br />
<br />
The art is bright and cute, though the character designs are a little off-putting, especially Rin and Mimi&#039;s hair. Outside of this flaw, everything looks nice and neat. It&#039;s a slightly above-average job all around.<br />
<br />
The music didn&#039;t stick to me but I don&#039;t remember it intruding in any way. The OP is one of my favorites, not for being a good song, but because the lyrics fit the tone of the series to a T. The ED is a hyperactive J-pop number that the audience this kind of show often attracts will enjoy greatly.<br />
<br />
For me, KoJikan was a mixed bag. It is not anywhere near the horror that it was constantly advertised as prior to its release, nor is it entirely redeemable due to its abrupt swings between the drama and its uncomfortable brand of comedy. The end result is quite commendable though, assuming one watches this without a die-hard need to find as many disturbing details as they can.<br />
<br />
Overall, I give Kodomo no Jikan an 8 out of 10.

    What can I say about this show that isn&#039;t absurd, offensive, or down right politically incorrect? As a forewarning to those who are offended by lolicon-esque (kids in ecchi situations) anime DO NOT WATCH THIS SHOW. <br />
<br />
<br />
With that aside, for what its worth, the show minus the loli porn wouldn&#039;t be that bad BUT there are ALOT of things wrong with the show in the technical sense. From episode one, you can tell this is only worth watching if you got the DVD version (if there is such a thing). Alot of jokes don&#039;t get off the ground because they&#039;re bleeped out and i don&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4168">
        think i need to mention about the lolicon/comedy situations. I don&#039;t mind them censoring the scenes but at least leave the speech in tact. Having whole sentences at a time bleeped out, funny words or emotions replaced with a duck or a dog sound or even the fabled comedy car horn definitely kills most of the shows main ingredient, shock comedy. <br />
<br />
So you get past how perverted a set of 3rd grade the girls are, how are their personalities? Well it seems like they borrowed a few character types from a few popular anime of previous airings. For instance Mimi is very moe and has large breasts especially for the age group she is supposed to be in. Kagamine Rin&#039;s other friend Kurogame pretty much Rin&#039;s polar opposite, very conservative, conceited, and mean. She is also in charge of pulling in the viewers that love the nekomimi girls (whereas Mimi pulls in the moe viewers). Lastly, Kagamine Rin can be easily labeled into the &#039;tsundere&#039; fan base but her personality is more unique than what you normally see in an anime. She basically displays the oppositie traits from Kuro-chan most of the time but she does have her good moments and ecchi moments. Rin is a very unpredictable character that you will either learn to love, hate, or even both. Although they don&#039;t cover Kuro&#039;s or Mimi&#039;s background as much, you will come to know all about Rin and how she&#039;s become how she is today which is rather interesting. <br />
<br />
Character styles isn&#039;t the main draw for this anime in my opinion, but rather the artwork is very top notch. Not only is the animation is very clean and detailed. The girls get different (and detailed) outfits for every episode. Their eyes  in this show is some of the best eyes i have ever seen drawn in an anime. Not just because of their general size, but in detail and color variation. The classroom children ALL look different from each other, complete with different types of clothing and hair styles. There are so many variations in this show its hard not to notice the hard work the staff has put into this anime. Theres even a scene when the kids have their cellphones and DS&#039;s out and they all looked unique from each other. They even take use of distance blur to an effect which is impressive itself. If there was any blemish about the artwork of the show would be the lack of different scene locations. It was either at school or one of three different homes (the automatic beach episode doesn&#039;t count). Also, some people will not care for the hair at all. Their hair is a very hit and miss subject, and as for me, i couldn&#039;t care less after episode two. I cared vary little about the story or the ecchiness of the show but the main reason i watched this was simply because of how high quality the artwork is. <br />
<br />
The story is easily forgettable but most of the time you&#039;ll pay more attention to what is going on at the moment than the overall story, all though the overall story wont kick in for a while.  But for the most part, you start to feel alot of things for Aoki-sensei. Sometimes you&#039;ll get mad at him, or wonder why he&#039;s so stupid, or how he can do something so reckless, or even wonder why he would bother to put himselves in certain situations. But for the most part you&#039;ll be worrying about him more than anything else. Also if you look past all the ecchiness, the three girls are really cute in their own way. And not because of their moe-ness but their voice acting is perfect and their range in emotions are spot on. Its hard to pick who my favorite seiyu would be out of the three because they are all that good of a seiyu. <br />
<br />
That brings me to another great part of the show, sound and music. Elementary school sounds just like school with rowdy children. Even when theres scenes when the school halls are empty, you can hear the bustling of the over sized air conditioning unit. Basically what I&#039;m trying to say is that the environmental sounds are pretty spot on. Its kinda sad that not most anime can&#039;t copy this much detail in environmental sounds as they do in here. It really brings out an anime from being a cut and paste low budget series. Even the music (mood or background) is very high quality. And the music varies in type as well, at times there would be techno and at times a comedy flute and also the suspenseful string quartet is even here. And since this is first and foremost a comedy anime, all the comedy bells and whistles are there, but not as much as you would expect. Lastly, the OP/ED songs are very catchy and energetic just like how the girls are. They fit the anime very well and its been a while since i actually appreciated a good OP and ED song from one anime. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s a shame that so many things get censored out, specifically the audio. Also it didn&#039;t help that the fansub didn&#039;t bother to translate some on screen text. But thats not the anime&#039;s fault. So what do you get when you plan to air a non-TV friendly show on TV? You get a lost in translation TV show. Although it would make a hell of a lot more sense if the school in question was high school instead of elementary school but then it wouldn&#039;t appeal to the lolicons right? Not many anime appeal to the lolicons so im sure this was made as a niche anime to seize that market. Most shows with little girls are supposed to appeal to little girls (Ichigo Mashimaro, Moetan, etc, etc) but this one is so obviously blatant with its use of ecchi its ridiculous. It tests a fine line between serious drama and ecchi comedy that it actually works. If it didn&#039;t, why would there be a second season? It would definitely be more understandable if it was a direct to DVD instead of airing on TV.

    After being recommended by a friend, I decided to check out this series during a lull in my hectic anime watching schedule. I wish I could’ve come up with a better introduction, but I’m writing this in between clacking away in a race against time to finish a 4,000 word creative piece about a magical girl forced to defend a town in Ukraine from radioactive zombies by Monday. I would wait, but I have a feeling that if I did, these thoughts would just poof from my head and wouldn’t come back nearly as easily.<br />
<br />
Kodomo no Jikan is a show that raises several interesting points

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37391">
        through a superb blend of drama and comedy about the nature of children’s emotions, and how they tend to be rather hyperbolic in nature. As we all know, children don’t learn self constraint on their own. By age 8, which is the age of the main children in KodoJikan, emotional control hasn’t fully developed, and there are still tendencies toward feeling strongly one way or the other that can sometimes overlap into precocious infatuation.<br />
<br />
Kodomo no Jikan is a show that follows Aoki Daisuke, a third grade teacher fresh out of college, eager to teach his new class. He has to deal with all the frustrations of fostering learning in elementary school students still in the prime stage of emotional growth: Complaints, balancing friendliness and strictness, spoiled brats… and a precocious girl with a Lolita Complex, named Kokonoe Rin, who lusts after him.<br />
<br />
Yes, from that synopsis, you will likely gather that KodoJikan is an ecchi-fest of monumental proportions that will make lolicons the world over cheer in jubilation. However, before you write it off as nothing more than pointless fanservice, I’m going to take away your pen and smack you hypothetically for making presumptions based on that overly simple synopsis.<br />
<br />
You’d be correct in assuming that this is heavy on the fanservice, but there’s an entirely different point to be made here: Not only does this series relish in the comedy of such an uncomfortable situation, but it does well at analyzing all the factors involved. And, happily enough, Daisuke doesn’t eventually fall for Rin. Not going to spoil anything here, but it ends on a very happy note, and Rin turns from a manipulative little succubus into a wholly sympathetic character with a tragic past, whose lust is somewhat justified.<br />
 Notice that I only said somewhat, since it’s still a little creepy how much she likes Daisuke.<br />
<br />
The story is wonderfully told and occasionally heart wrenching, the events of Episode 6 even more so, and there’s hardly ever a lull, even in some of the fluffier episodes.<br />
<br />
The only complaint that I have with KodoJikan is the censorship. In order to get the series aired, quite a lot had to be censored, through use of Rin kicking a giant ‘No’ symbol round and round and various animal noises. Strangely enough, some lewd things got through that were a little worse than what was censored. If at all possible, find it uncensored somewhere or read the manga to catch what you missed due to the irritating bird cheeps blocking things out.<br />
<br />
Aesthetically, the series is functional. The art style doesn’t impress, though the opening and closing songs are amazingly catchy, especially the overly-energetic J-Pop number at the end, so we’ll call it a wash.<br />
<br />
Of course there’s objectionable content; it’d be weird if a show about a girl eager to sex up a teacher 15 years her senior didn’t have any. However, it’s done with a purpose. There’s plentiful fanservice, but it isn’t done just for the sake of doing it. I’m going to likely get odd looks for this, and I don’t blame you, but I actually believe the underage fanservice helps drive the point home at times in ways that it wouldn’t if fanservice were avoided. It’s a main element, but it’s an element crucial to developing the plot to its fullest.<br />
<br />
To wrap things up, Kodomo no Jikan is a good series that elegantly makes the point that children have as many, if not more, complex emotional needs as adults do, and they need to be nurtured properly in order to grow up emotionally healthy. If you enjoy a show with a moral that isn’t beaten into your skull, even if it’s stated in a way that’s hard to bear at times, I couldn’t think of a better series to watch. It may just surprise you at the end by the depth and breadth of the matter covered.

    Kodomo no Jikan, where do I begin.<br />
<br />
After seeing this title pop up absolutely everywhere, outlining it&#039;s weird, disgusting, awkward and just extremely wrong storyline, i had to check it out. Rin Kokonoe is a 3rd grade elementary student, who forms mature (very mature) feelings for her 23 year old home room teacher, Sensei Aoki. The relationship between the two is quite hilarious, and just a little bit scary to put it lightly.<br />
<br />
At first I was expecting this to be some weirdly perverted anime, made by a weird person, just for a lame excuse to create lolita porn type episodes, but boy was I wrong. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186348">
        storyline is quite detailed, and very interesting. Kokonoe, without giving any spoilers, is lonely, and very misunderstood. She craves the attention of someone older, someone kind and someone who understands her, which turns her attention to Daisuke Aoki. Her attempts to seduce Daisuke are not even a bit subtle, writing inappropriate messages, sending flirty photos and continuously showing off her sexy lingerie. But it&#039;s not the perverted and disgusting anime people make it out to be. The stories behind every character are very interesting, making the relationships unique, and great to analyse and follow. <br />
<br />
Overall, i really enjoyed watching Kodomo no Jikan, it never failed to surprise me, and always gave me a good laugh.

    Kodomo no Jikan is a hilarious and highly controversial anime however all the censorship, makes this less enjoyable to watch and it does make me wonder why certain TV networks decided to ban it. ^_^<br />
<br />
Kodomo no Jikan (Child&amp;rsquo;s Time) is a School, Ecchi, Romantic, Comedy about Daisuke Aoki, the new homeroom teacher to a 3rd Grade class at elementary. He is very inexperienced and proves to have a problem teacher however his biggest problem is a girl in his class Rin Kokonoe, how happens to have a crush on him. The story is surprisingly great for this kind of anime nevertheless it ends up following

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1700">
        the usual trend by starting of happy and fun before getting too serious. There is plenty of drama but it never gets in the way of the fun nature of the show.<br />
<br />
Even though this anime may lack characters, all of the main characters are great; with their own personal traits, quirks and personalities. However it isn&amp;rsquo;t the na&amp;iuml;ve and thoughtless Daisuke Aoki that stands but in fact it is Rin Kokonoe. She is probably the most interesting &amp;ldquo;loli&amp;rdquo; character out there as she happens to be the main focus of the story, with plenty of revealing developments to be made on her alone.<br />
<br />
The quality of the animation isn&amp;rsquo;t amazing but is pretty good as it is able to show the cuteness of the girls and it could have proven been better, if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for the annoying censorship during ecchi moments. The music is pretty average and suits the show well however it suits it so well that it is barely noticeable.<br />
 <br />
Overall Kodomo no Jikan managed to be an enjoyable school comedy, full of hilarious sexual innuendos however due to how controversial this show was, most of the really good jokes where b*****d out. Also another thing that proved annoying was how they censored anything remotely ecchi, by covering it with the &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; hiragana, taking away all the fun from this show. Other than that this was still a good anime with very well defined characters and with a good amount of developments from the story. This anime is good if you want a laugh yet it would better if an &amp;ldquo;uncut&amp;rdquo; version is released, then I may consider increasing my score.<br />
<br />

    Well, of all things today I&#039;m writing a review of Kodomo no Jikan. I thought I was going to be writing a review of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni next, but time changes moods it would appear.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Kodomo no Jikan is a show that has created a lot of buzz for it&#039;s content and I assume for mostly it&#039;s content is it popular or notorious. It is by far not a very unheard of anime and manga, but there are a few things I think are undersaid about this anime and manga, or since I have only seen this anime, and this is the anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10427">
        section, the anime. So I&#039;m writing this review. Not that I needed a justification for doing so.<br />
<br />
This done one thing I have never seen done so much so in my life. And that is it&#039;s representation and extreme focus on child sexuality. This is what makes this show so notorious and so well known. It also in my opinion gives this show extreme artists merit. Well I have a lot more to say, and it&#039;s about time I leave my preface, but there will be a lot of such things in the coming review, as well as discussion of those so called undersaid things and misconceptions.<br />
<br />
1. Story<br />
Going by the book and numbered order again, I now discuss story. Though it feels like I left something out in my preface, it was already large. And hopefully I&#039;ll come across my thoughts again here.<br />
<br />
This story is an emotional mess and better labeled a drama instead of a comedy for such. The student in said anime description above, is exactly as sounds. The situation is of a underaged girl, who harassingly hits on her teacher constantly, and due to his position, understands to keep it at a distance. For obvious reasons. So her attraction and unrequited love only leave for loads of tension in the supposedly comedic &amp;quot;ecchi&amp;quot; situations.<br />
<br />
And to stack on top of this constant paranoia and fear you feel for the teacher. There this loads of drama about the past of the students. Which only creates more drama for the unrequited love of the student given the constant misunderstanding of their relationship. I do hope that&#039;s not a spoiler, in my opinion it is not. And it was required to properly go into detail about the drama of this show.<br />
<br />
These so called &amp;quot;comedic&amp;quot; situations, as I have mentioned before in quotes, have so much underlying drama it&#039;s hard to truly get any comedic value out of them. You might eek out a tense laugh at best from nervousness. But it&#039;s no laugh out loud comedy for sure. The one time I laughed at this show was hardly a situation between student and teacher, but teacher and teacher or student and student. The rest was extremely cringeworthy.<br />
<br />
And now to mention the ecchi, pretty much goes in line with the other things said. At best, these so called &amp;quot;child ecchi&amp;quot; situations are comedic but not very ecchi, and at worst, cringeworthy and pure remnants of drama. They&#039;re not meant to arouse you or make you fancy over the female human body like Moetan does, they&#039;re meant to shock you into some laughter hopefully, but fail to do so any mostly make you cringe for the whole situation. You feel sorry for the teacher the whole time, and even a little bit sorry for the student at the same time.<br />
<br />
That being said, it&#039;s mislabeled but not bad. This is an amazing breakthrough in animation and revolutionary. This is a drama romance lolicon anime. And it takes a hardcore, hardline stance on child sexuality. It doesn&#039;t exactly have the most intricate or complicated story, but it&#039;s a groundbreaking drama that deserves it&#039;s merit it&#039;s been given. And it&#039;s notoriety.<br />
<br />
I can give this at the very least a Nine.<br />
<br />
2. Art.<br />
I&#039;ve said a lot of good things about the art of shows I&#039;ve been reviewing lately. Well here&#039;s where I review a show with bad art. Okay maybe bad is too harsh of a word, but it&#039;s not so good. The art is dated, and is easily inferior to many of the animes during it&#039;s time and even before it&#039;s time. It&#039;s blocky, clunky, and not so pretty. And it&#039;s above average at best. They take traditional style, and they don&#039;t go anywhere with it. Don&#039;t watch this show expecting to see the most dazzling artwork you&#039;ve ever seen.<br />
<br />
3. Sound<br />
To be honest, I didn&#039;t notice the sound all that much. Which is probably a pretty negative thing. The OP song is somewhat grabbing, the voices aren&#039;t lacking, and any music that I don&#039;t remember at this point, was probably pretty good. But there&#039;s nothing grabbing or spectacular about the music.<br />
<br />
4. Character<br />
I think connected to the story, character development is one of the best parts of the show. I mean it IS the show. I mean I may not like the personality of all the characters, but they put the show forward. They easily make up for any character design and artwork with very vivid personalities. You&#039;ll love them, you&#039;ll hate them, but they&#039;ll make the show. If you&#039;re not watching the show for story and character development, well, then I don&#039;t know what you&#039;re watching the show for.<br />
<br />
5. Enjoyment.<br />
I think overall it has it&#039;s flaws, and it&#039;s most entertaining gripping anime ever. But overall, it&#039;s darn worth the watch. It&#039;s a work of beauty and a true piece of art. You have to be in the mood to watch it because it doesn&#039;t have extreme fast pace, just like it looks like. And it&#039;s not a jack of all trades, it&#039;s a school romance drama with a couple very boring scenes. But my if it&#039;s not just the most fresh, thoughtful, controversial, and well paced enough anime that you just, I wasn&#039;t, able to get it out of my system.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s an extremely ugly rock with a piece of uranium inside. But look past the dangers of uranium, and it&#039;s an absolutely essential, while dangerous and controversial thing. It is an utter gem in that light. And I think you&#039;ll just be drawn to it&#039;s highly radioactive uranium. I&#039;d say this deserves a seven at least. I&#039;m giving an eight.<br />
<br />
6. Overall.<br />
I think overall, even the overall is better than the enjoyment in this case. Because with it&#039;s any flaws, it&#039;s a work of art. Of magnificent proportions. It is an extremely unique, extremely beautiful, absolutely essential piece of controversial art that I think everyone should see. And if it shocks you, maybe that&#039;s a good thing. And it should most certainly be licensed in your country and bought.<br />
<br />
We treat A Modest Proposal as a classic piece of Western literature, to sensitize the rich to the plight of the poor. And Kodomo no Jikan is this anime for child sexuality. It will shock you of your cultural norm, and actually make you THINK about child sexuality.<br />
You may not think of it as a beautiful rock or gem. It&#039;s not. It&#039;s a piece of uranium. And now you can either let this energy go to waste, or use it.<br />
<br />
An overall nine seems about perfect for this. And fits the mood I feel for it. I impulsively feel it&#039;s a nine. And that&#039;s what I will give it. And giving it thought, it seems no less as well. I will stick with my nine rating. And I hope you will give this anime a chance if you haven&#039;t thus far. It is worth your time, energy, and money.

    Now that the first season is over, a damage assessment is in order.  Look for criticisms in the usual places, the points against this series should be legion.  It&#039;s pointless loli-fanservice trash. It panders to pedophiles.  It&#039;s yet another retread of overly precocious kids whose dialogues are contrived by writers who have no least idea how normal kids would interact. And as a prominent blogger puts it, even if you thought the series wasn&#039;t half bad, the other half is censored.<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t sugarcoat or paper over the fact that the show revolves around a nine-year-old continuously making mature sexual advances against her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1767">
        twenty-three-year-old teacher, some of which would be actionable by law even if she is of age. It is what it is.  I understand and respect the position of those of you who simply will not entertain that aspect of the show.  The boundaries that the show puts up that might give the brave viewer at least partial absolution in watching the show would be the fact that none of the adults neither make nor return any of the propositions, all the adults in the series have the kids&#039; best interests at heart, and even if Rin were to encounter an adult that might pose a threat to her, she has shown time and again that she can stand up for herself and take them down.<br />
<br />
It is the psychology behind the actions that brings me back to the series every week, despite the censorship and the remaining fanservice that serves to give the show notoriety.  Rin may be more sexually aware than a girl her age has any right to be, but when it comes to relating to adults, she is still like a kid who has just learned a new swearword: she simply doesn&#039;t know when it&#039;s  appropriate to put such knowledge to use and she seems to think that purience is the only way to win love.  And like a child, she can be easily hurt if she feels the love she gives is not reciprocated<br />
<br />
As a result, Aoki Daisuke finds himself in a bind that he in part created for himself.  In his quest to become Great Teacher Aoki, he wants to be on friendly terms with his students and avoids antagonizing them unnecessarily.  But in closing the gap between the student-teacher relationship, he allowed Rin to get close enough so that if he unequivocally rejects her sexual overtures, he risks irrevocably hurting her.  Hurting her is not an option for Daisuke since he truly cares for her well-being, despite the daily discomfort she puts him through.  It also doesn&#039;t help that he has little to no experience in the practice of love which prevents him from adequately dealing with Rin&#039;s behavior.<br />
<br />
Watching the interactions between Rin and Daisuke and seeing their complexities of their relationship manifest themselves really carries the show.  However the show would have been stronger if some time were spent developing the side characters instead of using them as simple foils.  I would like to see more of why Mimi, Kuro and Rin need each other in their lives and more of what makes Shirai-sensei and Hoin-sensei tick.  Also I am disappointed in how they made Reiji into a dislikable character towards the end.  Also, the removal of the distracting censorship would help the series tremendously.<br />
<br />
The technical aspects of the show were so-so.  If every episode were animated as brightly, as detailed, and as fluidly like the OVA, we would encounter little criticisms here.  But the way animation budgets are, we watch the series that we have, not the series that we wish.  The sound could be summarized by any of one of three backqrouund music: xylophones, a recorder, or a violin piece.  The OP and ED were standard J-pop fare that are not the least bit memorable.  All in all, the anime adaptation of the manga still passed the test and I would highly recommend the series.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Now, let me start off this review by saying that I hate myself.  I guess that&#039;s why I chose to watch this in the first place.  I wasn&#039;t expecting much from this show, but I sure wasn&#039;t expecting it to be this AIDS-y.  <br />
<br />
I know this show is directed towards pedophiles, so I suppose that&#039;s why I didn&#039;t enjoy it.  But that aside, the writing was awful.  It&#039;s just a slutty toddler trying to fuck her teacher.  Romance is fine, but the teacher decided he 1. &quot;Loved&quot; this little girl, and 2. Decided he COULD &quot;love&quot;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review161741">
        little girls, all in the second episode of the show.  Don&#039;t you think it would take a little longer than that?  Someone who never had the thought of being a kiddy fiddler just decided that his morals were wrong and that it&#039;s absolutely fine to love children that way?  I guess not.<br />
<br />
Now the weirder part of this, is that right after the episode where he said he &quot;loved&quot; her, he went right back to being a huge pussy.  That angered me.  Don&#039;t lie to a child and say you love them like that.  If you say that, you fuck that grade schooler, you fuck them good.<br />
<br />
All of the episodes really just blended together in this huge pile of masturbatory material for men who enjoy the sausage wallets of young girls.  There was one episode that I saw which was actually not that bad.  It explained the past of the main loli, and there was incest, but it wasn&#039;t disgusting or anything.  Her mother ended up dying, and it was admittedly pretty sad.  It was cool to do that, but then it went back to the regular shit it was doing before.<br />
<br />
The music was very ok.  I liked it enough, definitely the best part of the show, but it also wasn&#039;t anything mind blowing.  The Art was fine (I don&#039;t particularly care too much about that, just me), and then the story was pretty much non-existent.<br />
<br />
Now, I do recommend this show.  Only for two possible reasons though.  Either 1 - You&#039;re a pedophile and you like this sort of thing.<br />
or 2 - You want to have a good laugh at a below average tv show.<br />
<br />
In all seriousness, I enjoyed watching this, because it was really bad, and I&#039;m a masochist.  This isn&#039;t anything ground breaking, and usually I&#039;ll say stay away from this show, but I don&#039;t really care what other people do.  If you enjoyed this, good for you, but this is just my opinion through the experiences that I&#039;ve had.

    I&#039;ll admit, when I first read what this show was about immediately started to underestimate it, belittle it, and was expected the worst show ever. However, when I completed it I found myself saying MORE MORE MORE! Absolutely amazing story although a bit cliche here and there. What I like most was that every time I thought something negative about the story or characters something intense or dramatic would happen that would shut me up lol. Now your main characters are three typical &quot;moe&quot; loli&#039;s &quot;Big eyes&quot; &quot;big hair&quot; etc who are supposed to be in grade school however when you watch it, their characteristics,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203780">
        personalities and behavior as show by the anime makes it a bit difficult to believe. Lastly, one (that teacher in every other anime) whose a loser and virgin and is easily annoyed etc. The relationship between the characters is what also makes the story so great! The art is your average late 2000&#039;s-2005 quality. Acceptable for its time. The character designs as I said before are &quot;big hair&quot; &quot;big eyes&quot; nothing that really stands out too much other than Rin&#039;s hair accessories that make her look like she got hit in the head and bumps came out. Overall I would highly recommend you check this series out there&#039;s OAD&#039;S and OVA&#039;S you can watch also if you want MORE! Finally thoughts, 8/10 show at best! nothing more nothing less.

    At first, i just tough this was an excuse for a VERY line-crossing Lolicon anime, even for japanese standarts.<br />
<br />
Now i&#039;ve watched some episodes, i tend to think about it differently.<br />
I think this anime will be like for its genre, like school days was for romance.<br />
They are daring, and prolly will manage to reach its goals because, they want to cause an uproar on how we see love, and the limits of it, and prolly some darker side we all hide underneath us.<br />
<br />
Student &amp;lt;--&amp;gt; Teacher love?<br />
<br />
We NOT talking about High school girl &amp;lt;--&amp;gt; Sensei<br />
We talking 3rd primary grader &amp;lt;--&amp;gt; Sensei<br />
<br />
She is a tomboy, but she loves

        him? Find out in this anime that might have a very unlikely and very daring ending.

    My first review was about the notorious School Days, so it was obvious that my next review will be about another piece of junk... Well not really, I intended to make  Agame Ga Kill, but I was reading Horimiya, I took a brake and entered on MAL to check the original manga, and I dont know how, I found thise series at recomandation, and discovered that it has really great scoores: 8,9,10... WTF ?! So to save some pure souls from watching this series and maybe end up becoming lolicons (it can happen), I chose to leave Akame ga Kill for later and review

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173813">
        this  mediocre piece of shi... fan service...I must start by saying that I didnt finish the anime, I drop it after 3 episodes, then I read a little of manga, really fast between chapters, and spend a day reading summarys...Yep, I discovered that the manga was popular so because I am an M, I studied the story because my heart cant bear reading directly immoral stuffs or NTR. Just like I did with another series Cross and Roses, or something, about a beiach who is raped for 50 chapters, and she fall in love with the rapist... ah and she break up with the nice guy that loved her a lot to be with him - and i suffered for a week TT.TT...<br />
<br />
Back to our review... Kodomo no Jikan is a story about horny 7-11 years girls who tires to seduce their teacher. This would be the story on short. You have this little girl who develops a crush on her teacher, a pretty normal thing (I dont know about girls, but boys had, and I had a crush for a female teacher or 2)... so is something that every normal kid would do, the problem is that this girl unlike a normal child ends up trying to get his di_k, in other words to seduce him, and she even does stuffs like blackmailing... Is pretty difficult to talk about something else, because this is the story.... Sure many would say: &#039;&#039;Is more than this, is a deep and dramatic story... that has some ecchi moments.&#039;&#039; WRONG! KnJ is an ECCHI manga about the sexualization of childrens that has some dramatic elements too - not a dramatic story that has ecchi elements... Basically, the cheap and forced drama is put there just to make this series a little more acceptable. What is really shocking is that the mangaka is actually a woman - and that is the reason why Knj has some drama, this is why KnJ wasnt just an ecchi comedy for phedophiles... Even so that doesent really help, because the series - for commercial purpouse or because of the editor - was transformed in a ecchi shouen. This series would had been much much better, maybe even become a classic, if it was a Seinen, without ecchi elements (or at least they could had been done in a mature and realistic way, not as fan-service and comedy), the ideea wasnt 100% bad, but the way it was done is horrible (90% lolicon fan-service and 10% some good elements). So why is the story done bad ? Well, in an ecchi comedy, something like a scene of masturbation for example, becomes fan-service - you will have a 7-8 years old loli rubing her pu#@y watching porns, and in the real world the Faps will be strong. That is the difference between this and Seinen, this would be seen not as erotic but as something natural, and the sturggle of a growing child, etc (of course there are some who would fap even to cracked walls, but here i am talking about responsable peoples). <br />
 Lets talk a little about, CHARACTERS. You have the horny manipulative and too mature for her age (mentally, not phisically), 7-11 years old, (that because the story follows 4 years of their life) and has a dramatic story, a lesbian loli who has a bad mounth and knows what a virgin is at her age, a too well developed girl (she has oppai... now, the problem is that I live in Europe, here girls develop fast, my sister had really big boobs at 13, another sister that is 12 now, she start do develop her boobs pretty well too...  but they did it after the age of 11, and was seen as EARLY... I never, ever heard of a 7 years old with boobs - maybe only a sick one... Japnese womans are flat like a surf board, they look at 40 like Europeans at 16, so in an anime, a 7-10 years old gil with boobs, can only be seen as a fetish not reality), and the all known Male protagonist who is boring and shady like fuck, has nothing special and at 23+ is still a virgin... and a guy with a trauma. Basically the characters arent that bad, especially a 7 years girl who seem to be lesbian, in a more serious story, this would be interesting and dramatic, but is not the case here...<br />
 To keep this shorter, KnJ is a story made for phedophiles, for peoples with sick fetish about assertive little girls, who would be ready to trow in a sexual relationshp, and maybe even be experts. The difference is the protagonist, who try to keep the distance.. but in the end he falls in love with a 11 years old. And all the drama and shit wont change this fact, I see them as excuses. I actually find this offensive to great anime that got severe critics for having some &#039;bad&#039;&#039; elements... Like SAO for example (averge anime, but good example), where everyone said it suck because it had incest (- a girl in love with her cousin, who didnt feel the same. Nothing happened, he didnt sake the butty, but it was incest -_-), and on the other side anime like KissxSis or Oreimo, who are about incest are great and popular... or No Game No Life, who scared the shit of the anime fans, because of the sexualization of childrens (there where some panty shots of Shiro), it doesent matter the great plot, characters, world, artbehind the anime - there is child sexualization so it sucks, but an anime about the sexualization of childrens like this one, is great because has something deeper in it (well  Rin had something deep in her in the list chapter, so...), is just like how a 10 years girl in bikini licking a banana, is Art in U15 Japanese magazine for the middle age mans who buy them.. And Yeah, ATENTION SPOILER, in the end, in manga, Aoki fuck the children on her 16th birthday... you could say is acceptable, in parts of Japan the consent age is 13, so he didnt brake the law, and he waited for her to grow up and become more mature, he is not a phedophile.. well, here is the problem, in the 5 years in which they didnt meet (but they remained in love and loyal to each other by a miracle), she didnt grow at all, she still had the body of a 9 years old, so all the phedo.. fans, recived their expected fan service with Rin over Aoki trying to fit his Alpha Male mature di@K in her little undeveloped pu@#y... and yes, she was still flat chested.<br />
 This anime doesent bring anything extraordinary to the industry, is far from being a masterpiece, is far from being even average, is a dumb an ecchi comedy, that tries to bring some serious issues and drama, but it fails, because the mangaka chose the wrong genre. The comedy even trough a main genre, is dumb, you will actually laugh at how weak and average it is, the only comedy you will get will the the lesby loli calling the MC a virgin, pantsu and ecchi stuffs, and some dumb &#039;&#039;funny&#039;&#039; situation that are still erotic (like Rin sending the MC a photo of her pu@#y by mistake). The Romance is.... you have an 11 years girl who for some reason is able to wait 5 years to be with the one she love, be loyal and give him her virginity in the end, even trough at the age of 7 she was horny like a rabbit - and yet, at the age we all get horny, our little pervert is a good future waifu... and a 23-27 guy, who wait for his 11 years old love interest to grow up and lose his virginity at 32 with her (and is unable to get a damn woman in 5 years)... More importantly you have an 7-11 years old, who is able to chose the man with which she wants to spend the rest of her life, and is able to get over some difficulties to be with him =_=... I was mature and smart at her age, and yet I would fap on playboy magazines and I was in love with the most popular girl in my class, whose name I dont even remeber now... Drama, there is drama, but is really forced, sometimes too dark, and it really feels out of the story... is to serious fo the non-serious story. In 7 years I saw many anime (my anime list is far from complete, and there is no real category for incomplete anime), I think every anime has its magic, but Kodomo no Jikan is the first anime I trought it suck, right next to KissxSis (the series).<br />
<br />
 If I recomand ? Well, you can watch this if you are someone who cant get a boner if the naked girl in front of him isnt under 12... You will most definetly enjoy, even if you arent a phedophile but you are a lolicon (boner for 2D girls under 13), you have here naked loli, masturbation, end even more at the final + tons of pantsu, so. You wont enjoy, if like me you are a normal human being with morality and normal sexual orientation (I mean towards a normal ages). <br />
 Finnal Score: 3.

    Ok, so to begin, there&#039;s a few things I must mention.<br />
<br />
First of all, probably like most of you, I began this series as a joke after seeing it on a list of most f***ed up anime, so I definitely wasn&#039;t expecting anything out of this.<br />
<br />
Secondly, this show, like most other reviewers said, takes advantage of shock comedy. This is definitely not for everyone, and if you don&#039;t like that, or are very timid of lolis, then I&#039;m afraid this show is not for you.<br />
<br />
Now, let&#039;s begin the review.<br />
<br />
At first glance, Kodomo no Jikan seems like a pedophile&#039;s anime; this is because of the ecchi scenes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205526">
        the kids cause, and how the teacher fails to react appropriately to these situations, making him appear like a lolicon. This is understandable, because the first 5 episodes are basically that, just 3rd graders teasing a teacher and getting him into compromising situations. However, if you can bulldoze past that and watch the rest, you&#039;ll see it is so much more than that.<br />
<br />
Kodomo no Jikan is actually an anime demonstrating two things: the psychological aspect of a child, and the inability for adults to understand children in the way they want to be understood. <br />
<br />
I know this sounds weird, but at about the 6th episode, you&#039;ll see what I&#039;m talking about. What most people don&#039;t understand, is that children have a much different thought process compared to adults. Because adults don&#039;t understand this, they naturally conform the children to behave and act just like what the adults deem is right. However, this could not be more incorrect.<br />
<br />
Children are very vulnerable to influence compared to adults, because they are just beginning to learn how the world works. The two main sources of influence tend to be their home environment, and their school environment. As newcomers to school, children are at their most creative - they are not limited by reality until later into school, usually middle school. The reason their imagination becomes limited is because adults don&#039;t understand how children think, and refuse to even attempt to do so; instead, they force them to conform to the rigid rules of society. <br />
<br />
All of this is shown in this anime. The teacher (Aoki-sensei) is a brand new teacher, and therefore not accustomed to the way school works. Therefore, he has great ideas, unhindered by the school&#039;s rules. The foil of his character is depicted by Shirai-sensei, the typical old school strict teacher. She constantly belittles Aoki for his methods of teaching and handling his kids, and tries to force him into the traditional style of teaching.<br />
<br />
However, alongside this, he also has interactions with the three 3rd graders who make his life much more difficult. During these many interactions, the teacher Aoki misunderstands what the children are trying to tell him, because he views them as kids, as most adults do, and this is a problem in society. As we cast away children&#039;s thoughts as insignificant and worthless, we give them the mentality that they are insignificant and worthless, and this hurts a child so much. Luckily, our heroines are very defiant and try to fix this problem by trying to explain their thoughts to Aoki.<br />
<br />
As &quot;relationship&quot; problems began to occur, we end up seeing Aoki finally grasp the meaning of what the children are trying to say, albeit after many tears have been shed from responses made without thinking. <br />
<br />
We also see the fickle nature of children as they desperately attract attention, because children cannot be neglected – they need love at that time of their life more than any other time. Many of the people who watch this fail to see past the ecchi nature of the 3rd graders, and into their minds to see why they are doing this. This show does very well in mimicking the thought process of a child, and really opens your eyes to the world around us.  I cannot say more about this without spoilers, but just think about it deeper than what you simply see. <br />
<br />
This ended up becoming much longer than what I had actually wanted, but I hope this convinces you to watch this great show. Please try to look past the cover, and focus on the inner meaning of this anime, as it does have a very good story. Thanks for reading.<br />

    I&#039;ll be honest  here, Kodomo no Jikan is not the most normal animes I&#039;ve ever seen but it is worthy of a review. Now this anime does takes sexual innuendo and pushes a lot and puts it onto a level of adult and child and even a little of incest in between which is where I found it to be somewhat weird.<br />
<br />
Story 2/10<br />
What can I say, this anime doesn&#039;t really have any major conflict or plot development. Its mostly just about the three girls: Kagami, Kokonoe and Usa harrassing there teacher Aoki ever day. When I said the sexual innuendo was present I meant

          <span style="display: none;" id="review169573">
        it was coming from the children not the adult in question which just makes it even weirder than it already is.<br />
<br />
Art 7/10<br />
It was good and very realistic indeed. It wasn&#039;t too heavy and it usually fit itself into every situation. Can&#039;t really say whats holding it back but meh, it just seems generic though thats not to say that it was bad just generic.<br />
<br />
Sound 8/10<br />
Music for intro and credits were very good to be honest. They fit into the anime but I didn&#039;t really felt moved by them after listening in  a couple of times through but damn that little rolling sound of their logo at the intro scares the shit out of me every time.<br />
<br />
Character 7/10<br />
Hmm the characters here are quite unusual. Our  three main girls are in the third grade but seem very affiliated with sexual slang and terms which I don&#039;t know means anything but it really bothered me. It makes me wonder, where did they even acquire such knowledge. However they were still somewhat of an enjoyable bunch of friends. Kokonoe is in love with the teacher Aoki and forces herself upon him with harrasment and even goes as far as kissing him on the lips its kind of disgusting but yet at the same time I found myself laughing at some of this stuff. It beats me but they did a really good job of modeling child-like shenanigans. Other than that the character development was present but I didn&#039;t really feel like it took off any until the final episode.<br />
<br />
Overall 6/10<br />
Kodomo no Jikan is one of those animes that sticks holes in your morals if you got any but I did find it enjoyable to say the least. At first glance I was actually not going to watch it when I thought most of the character relationships were going to be the other way around [man on child] but was relieved when it was a child&#039;s doing. Though I do feel like there is something missing in this anime. The story if any, just didn&#039;t feel fulfilling at all and everything I saw was kind of expected from the git go. If you wanna watch something a little different for once I totally recommend this for you but don&#039;t take any of this anime to heart.

    I had to take many, many cold showers after watching this show and I am sure that I have been added to some sort of watch list for finishing it.  <br />
This show is just blatant pedophilia.  I can understand a 600 year old vampire loli or something of the sort; hell, I can even understand full on loli hentai existing but this show crosses the line for me.  What makes this show so unsettling is the rationalization of pedophilia.  It portrays the situation Aoki-sensei finds himself in as out of his control and not a very bad thing, partially because of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review352790">
        that.  It also portrays third graders as being a bit too mature, as if they could handle, or even understand the sexual situations they&#039;re constantly remarking about and being in during the entirety of the show.  I&#039;m not sure if the author of the manga has ever met a third grader.  It&#039;s not just the sexual things, they all have phones and kononae-chan even casually went to the store on her own once like that was normal.  If you saw an 8 year old girl alone in a store, you would be very alarmed for the safety of the child but no, this is okay apparently.  This kind of thing is the problem with the show.  It acts like a relationship between a fully grown adult and an elementary school student isn&#039;t a one sided thing and would be okay.  Anybody that speaks up in the show about how Aoki isn&#039;t handling kononae&#039;s actions properly are framed like bad people.  ei a super strict teacher who doesn&#039;t know what fun is or a trauma filled insane teen.  This avoids the issue at hand that Aoki, a full grown man, is obviously a pedophile and should have never became a teacher in the first place.  <br />
If it was just the pedophilia I had a problem with I might not have rated Kodomo no Jikan a one star but this just isn&#039;t a good show in any way.  All the characters are really flat and the animation is really bad too.  I looked up what other anime came out around this time, thinking maybe it was dated but no, it&#039;s just bad.  So, so bad.

    One of the things that can ultimately impede a show&#039;s commercial success is whether it really appears to be what it actually is. Case in point: Kodomo no Jikan. There are many people who perhaps glance at this anime, and maybe even check out the first episode, and come to the conclusion that it&#039;s a perverted lolicon series with no plot and all the depth and character of a spoon. See, this is where the ability to overlook fanservice, even if you aren&#039;t particularly attracted to it, is beneficial. In doing so, you&#039;ll push further and further into this series, and discover that it really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review90099">
        isn&#039;t what it looks like.<br />
<br />
So is it a shallow ecchi series? No. It is ecchi. It is loli. And it is also one of the most remarkably deep and moving dramas I&#039;ve ever watched.<br />
<br />
In terms of plot, it&#039;s pretty basic. But it was never a plot series. This is the kind of show where the characters are the real focus. And aside from a somewhat bland everyman protagonist, the characters are incredibly good. There are layers of depth to them that allow you to interpret their motivations and read beyond what they are saying. Is Rin, the female lead, really in love with her teacher? Or is she simply deprived for attention, and seeking recognition, whether it be good or bad, from one of the few adult figures in her life? These levels of depth exist in all of the characters, with the primary exception being one of the main lead&#039;s colleagues, who doesn&#039;t serve a huge purpose beyond aiding the development of Daisuke and Rin, and isn&#039;t particularly interesting at all. There are some great character moments (episode 6 being my highlight of the entire series) and, if you&#039;re into it, there is some lighter ecchi (which, admittedly, becomes a bit stronger in the disappointingly short second season).<br />
<br />
In terms of art and animation, it&#039;s nothing special. The character designs are pretty good, but it certainly isn&#039;t the highpoint of the entire series. I can&#039;t say I have a lot to say about sound, other than the fact that it serves its purpose and doesn&#039;t put you off, which is a always good.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll give a definite recommendation to this series, and suggest that those who question this series try and overcome your prejudices a little. Yes, there is fanservice, but it&#039;s not the driving force of the show. Think about it: by ignoring this show simply because it features a more controversial form of fanservice that you&#039;re prejudiced against, aren&#039;t you just depriving yourself access to one of the most fantastic drama anime ever?<br />
<br />
God, this really isn&#039;t my best review.

    If there was ever a reason to beat me up when I was younger, this was the prime example.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t believe I watched this. I can&#039;t believe anyone has watched this. I can&#039;t believe people KEEP watching this. I can&#039;t believe anyone MADE this. I can&#039;t believe we act like anime even matters anymore when something so vile and putrid as this exists. I can&#039;t believe I ever thought it was okay to sit and watch this while browsing memes or some other dumb and absurd thing. This show is absolutely disgusting, filthy, putrid, and everything wrong with the industry.<br />

    Kodomo no Jikan is simply a masterpiece that&#039;s been stunted by western politics and moral dilemmas.<br />
<br />
The story is amazing, the characters are iconic, everything about the series is 10/10.<br />
<br />
The anime is cut drastically short compared to the very long running manga, which is disappointing. However the anime is still worth watching.<br />
<br />
A tale of forbidden romance, innocent yet poisoned by taboo. A girl who suffers from the loss of her Mother, a man who discovers how blind love can truly be.<br />
<br />
Sadly, all of this is overlooked. Simply scroll through other reviews and you&#039;ll see people ignoring all of these qualities because the romance of this anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324516">
        offended them.<br />
<br />
KNJ is a fine example of why freedom of artistic expression should be protected from moral supremacy and systematic censorship.

    I guess you can say Kodomo no Jikan is defiantly something unique. Its not what you expect from the title, and not what you expect from pictures, small clips or AMVs you may have seen. In fact its probably all of that combined.<br />
On first impression it seams kind of like lolicon, so basically a pervy anime with no back story at all. but the art is good, it begins in a humors way, and keeps you interested with nothing other but the introduction to a back story :D<br />
The further along you go, the deeper you dig into the surprisingly difficult lives of Rin, Mimi, Kuro

          <span style="display: none;" id="review65665">
        and Reiji, and how a barely experienced teacher can get through to them and learn a couple things himself.<br />
I guess to even consider watching this anime you&#039;d have to be lacking what i would probably call &quot;Anime Prude.&quot; and be willing to encounter not some, but a lot of pedo bear related things... that ultimately help build the story line as well.. and also i guess a romance, an awkward romance.. if you&#039;re into that stuff, like me. :)<br />
Kodomo no Jikan has some tragedy, comedy, ecchi, school life, romance/shojo (especially in its art) etc, it has something for almost everyone :)

    Kodomo no Jikan was an anime that came to me out of nowhere. My friend suggested it to me as a joke due to the fact that there is somewhat of a needlessly large amount of ecchiness involved in the story. But the more I watched, the more I was engrossed in the actual plot of it all. <br />
<br />
The love triangles and awkward situations that made certain things impossible to overcome by certain characters made it all that much more fascinating. Mimi being lonely without her friends and having a love interest in Reji. Kuro being a lesbian and having a love interest in Rin

          <span style="display: none;" id="review94975">
        along with looking up to the Shrew Shirai. And Rin herself, being the orphaned youngster who seemingly has an unrelenting and unbreakable love for Akoi. <br />
<br />
Not only the connections of the characters makes it interesting, the revelations, that the anime and the manga gives to us, upon their motivations for why they do what they do. I became slightly obsessed with all of it and read the entire manga within a few days wanting to know how it ended. <br />
<br />
SPOILER!!!!!!<br />
<br />
The ending is the only problem that I have with everything. It basically states that Akoi was to embarrassed to ashamed to speak to Rin over the course of three years. But when they finally meet, they fuck...THEN END. <br />
<br />
Granted, it does show some really touching parts with Kuro and Shirai, and Mimi with Reji. But all three situations are left somewhat open. It never explained how Kuro overcame her jealousy of Akoi or her love for Rin, Mimi wasn&#039;t shown while confronting her mother for being to strict on her and deciding to live with Reji, and it didn&#039;t show the foreshadowing wedding of Akoi and Rin that was mention a few episodes before the ending. <br />
<br />
All things that I wished to see were not there and I ended the story sad and incomplete. I just personally felt that the ending made the entire manga wasteful compared to everything. <br />
<br />
But it is what it is and life must go on. If It had a better ending, it probably would have come close to the top of my favorite animes. But sadly it fell through at the end. :(<br />

    It&#039;s safe to say that Kodomo No Jikan is not for those who are unable to see past what the show is perceived to be like, in other words if lolicon scares you, you shall not pass!<br />
<br />
But i digress, i became more acquainted with the show as i watched, because at the start i too was prepared for the worst. However this anime with its brilliant character design, and very personal slice of life - type presentation surpassed my expectations. I kid you not, the show is teetering on a fine line of ethics, but over time i came to understand more about the back

          <span style="display: none;" id="review161059">
        story through the show&#039;s various information dumping and eventually came to find that the real theme behind this is tragedy. The bold way in which Kodomo No Jikan is presented may hinder people from noticing the connections it makes to many tragic and well narrated real life issues. Which is a shame because the story that you will be told should you decide to watch is a beautiful one.<br />
<br />
Moving away from the deep stuff though... The show can also be quite comedic, often this is in the form of seeing Daisuke being in awkward situations. And all in all, it is a fairly pleasant anime to watch all things considered.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not fully confident in my above generalization though, because there are so many aspects available for me to analyse and lead you to thinking something completely different, so you really must watch it if you want to pick up this unique story... The more i did so, the more i learned about the show, and my own open mindedness.<br />
