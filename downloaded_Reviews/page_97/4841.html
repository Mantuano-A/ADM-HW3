    Story: Without a doubt, V Gundam is the saddest Gundam story to date. And before anything else is said, I think it&#039;s worth a mention to say that a lot of people die, and most of the time for no good reason at all. That aside, I have to say I really loved the storyline. However, some of the story arcs in the middle could have been left out, and the story would still be intact; a lot of the time during said arcs I found myself wondering why the characters were doing what they were doing. There&#039;s not a lot of narrative glue to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review7299">
        stick the parts together, and to keep one interested during some of the low parts. But, overall it&#039;s a nice story, with an emphasis on death, and at least during the last arc, a huge emphasis on the beauty of life.<br />

Art: Very good. V Gundam uses a very simple art style to convey the characters and the Mobile Suits; which is both good and bad. Most of the Suits are very similar to each other, and are very rarely any unique. Characters however, look very nice, and some are just too cool for words, while others are just meh. Battles are everything you would expect from a mecha show, and although somewhat exaggerated at times (or almost all of the time), they&#039;re mostly very good. The simple style works here to make the art very nice looking even today.<br />
<br />
Sound: Not much to say here. There&#039;s an excellent cast of actors working on the voices, and the mecha sounds are great, but nothing really stands out in this category.<br />
<br />
Characters: We&#039;ve got a cast of mostly children and women, with the main villain and one of the main characters being male. The rest of the male cast are either lesser characters or very old men. I can&#039;t quite remember why the cast is like it is, but it brings a fresh look on what might be a stale storyline. It also has the effect of removing almost all romantic involvement between the main characters. There&#039;s a peace-loving-battle-scarred boy, a princess girl, and a group of what seem to be orphaned children. Interaction between them is what really pushes the story along. Without a doubt, Oliver and Captain Gomez were my favorite characters, both of which received little screen time, but both of whom were very central to the story.<br />
<br />
Overall: No where near as good as First Gundam, V Gundam is nonetheless a very nice looking, anime featuring a somewhat lacking storyline that&#039;ll get your emotions running if you&#039;re not prepared for it. Definitely recommended if you&#039;ve seen the other UC animes, however, the story is completely separate from the main meta-plot.

    Renowned as being the most depressing Gundam show, Victory is an odd sort of a series. At times it evokes the bleakness of Tomino&#039;s older works such as The Ideon and Zeta Gundam, while at others it&#039;s a humorous space adventure with wacky kids in the vein of Xabungle.<br />
<br />
The art is similarly variable, with some episodes looking wonderful and others distinctly less so.<br />
<br />
The music is consistently good, however, with a full set of quality OPs and EDs, plus a brilliant, poignant insert song or two.<br />
<br />
Essentially, Victory picks up the UC storyline long after even F91 and Unicorn are done and dusted, with the Earth Federation

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25155">
        completely ineffective. Elements of the show work with this, such as the cameo appearance from a Salamis or two in some episodes, but it does stand alone in its own right.<br />
<br />
The main character is incredibly likeable - Usso gets on with it, does what has to be done and doesn&#039;t vacillate, whine or arbitrarily punch people for making fun of his name (too much.) He has a badass action Haro. He has a likeable dog which survives the whole series.<br />
<br />
Contrasting him is Shakti, who is useless and annoying for a good part of the series. The villains are similarly unimpressive, with the only really good ones being Katejina and a few of the minor Zanscare leaders. The rest are fairly forgettable rehashes of UC archetypes (Chronicle is one of the weakest Char analogues in the franchise, notable for being as much of a failure as Zeta Gundam&#039;s Jerid Messa)<br />
<br />
Mech design is all over the place, from the stylish and deadly V2AB to the plain insane Dodgore and Adastrea, which would be better suited to a super robot show. When it hits its stride, the results are spectacular but unfortunately that doesn&#039;t happen too often.<br />
<br />
In terms of serious military drama, Victory comes across as a slightly tasteless black comedy rather than a bleak space horror ala Ideon or a depiction of a morally bankrupt hellhole as shown in Dougram. The climactic moments when Usso loses someone close to him are rarely hard-hitting but often ridiculous - almost equivalent to a mecha version of the Saw or Final Destination movies in their overly elaborate and telegraphed natures.<br />
<br />
So all this criticism laid bare, what redeems Victory?<br />
<br />
Firstly that it&#039;s different to a lot of Gundam despite deriving from it. It&#039;s at times fun, at times kind of bleak and frequently unpredictable.<br />
<br />
Secondly, its likeable characters are really pleasant and nice to watch.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, while the pacing is a little wacky and sometimes not ideal, the ending arc is very intense and powerful. One moment, where the insert song is used perfectly to accompany a moment of sacrifice, will stick with you.<br />
<br />
By all means give Victory a good go before giving up on it. Just be prepared to accept it is very flawed.

    Victory gundam is a series that catches quite the bad rep with it often being regarded as one of the worst entries in the franchise, when I was going into the series I was embracing for the worst , but what I ended up seeing wasn’t the travesty some see it as but rather a solid series that was able to convey some truly beautiful moments and messages that can even act as a entry level gundam as its pretty much stand alone from other gundam despite being a universal century entry. Now don’t get me wrong, victory gundam has flaws that has garnered it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review159297">
        infamy, many of the negatives attributed to victory gundam come from its supposedly forced deaths and odd placement of goofy and absurd moments. And those flaws are sadly quite true as there are many deaths that frankly felt forced and didn’t need to happen in addition to some downright bizarre scenes that feel completely out of place with the show’s generally dark and depressing tone. However while victory gundam has its weak points I also believe it does so much right that it can outweigh its faults in the end, that is if one’s tolerances for what it does wrong is strong enough and this is going to greatly determine whether victory is for you or not.<br />
<br />
As unconventional and potentially dissuading as this may be its probably best to address the negatives of this series first before getting into what the show does right so try not to get dissuaded dead on arrival, Like I said I believe one&#039;s tolerance of the following things are really going to determine whether victory gundam is really for them and knowing what to expect is best in determining this:<br />
<br />
-Deaths: lets tackle this one right off the bat, victory gundam is billed with the largest body count in the franchise, and frankly there are quite a few deaths that didnt need to happen. Victory gundam has a bad tendency to introduce a character and give them focus for an episode only to kill them off immediately that same episode. Many of these deaths feel very formulaic and can create a disconnect in emotion the series should be conveying during these death scenes and instead makes them feel sloppy and lacking in impact. It really can make the deaths seem predictable and there are more than a few times where the reasons they die are completely avoidable. The worst case of this is a heroic sacrifice about halfway in of a semi important character up to that point where he/she kamikazes into a enemy to supposedly save another character....however the enemy is completely unaffected and the person they supposedly were saving was just fine without their sacrifice ultimately making their death needless.  <br />
<br />
HOWEVER! Whilst victory gundam has its poorly executed deaths not all of them are bad, actually there are some truly well done and powerful death scenes. In fact most of the dumb and absurd death scenes are only done on really small and unimportant characters (admittedly sometimes as a result of the dying after being introduced complaint above) but whenever a generally major character dies (and alot of times even really minor one off characters) have some really impacting deaths. Its poorly done deaths are a big issue with the series but there is still really well done ones in there and Id actually argue there is more well done ones than bad and the good actually play a major part in developing the main character uso which ill get into in a bit. If you cant possibly forgive a series for dumb mistreatment of (mostly minor) character&#039;s mortality then victory gundam may irk you in the wrong way but if your willing to forgive the series in favor of the ones it does right than it may be more up ones alley<br />
<br />
-Absurdity: Victory gundam is a really dark series depicting the most brutal and at times disturbing imagery in the series; in some regards victory gundam is the most realistic gundam in the sense that the true brutality of war and the destruction these mechs are capable of causing are most accurately displayed in this series. And it’s for that reason these random absurd scenes can really hurt the show. Now you’re probably wondering what I mean by absurdity, what I mean by that is Victory gundam has a handful of really out of place goofy scenes that distract the dark tone of the show, worst of which is when the main character fights a squad of jetpacked bikkini soldiers who he unsurprisingly obliterates cause he is in a fucking mech (this scene is on youtube under the name &quot;Bikini Babe Assault in Victory Gundam&quot; if you don’t believe me). They are pretty rare but their appearances are memorable (but not in the good way) so that they will stick around in your mind and potentially hurting the series’ image. These scenes are generally pretty funny but when the show’s point is to be a dark and serious war drama being funny is not a good thing.<br />
<br />
Alright so if your still reading and shaking your head in disapproval from how I started off a review for a series I’m recommending by immediately shit talking it then its time to get into the part where I actually say why people should watch it. Victory gundam has its flaws but I believe victory also does much right:<br />
<br />
-Characters: This is by far the strongest part of victory gundam, for starters Uso erwin our protagonist has an instantly likable personality, to top this off the way his development is handled is truly excellent. His development is dependent on him coming face to face with the horrors of war and changing as a result of them ultimately becoming a scarred but matured character similarly to zeta gundam&#039;s protagonist Kammile Bidan. His character development was very visible and by shows final 10 episodes he felt entirely different than he did at the start. He was a character I really grew attached to and he showcases a real display of humanity, he’s a 13 year old boy experiencing true hell, many of his actions feel genuine like a 13 year old boy would do, he has his naive moments which may or may not be a turn off to some but that just makes him feel more genuine as when you’re young you are naive, To top this off the series isnt sugar coating his maturing nature as he shouldn&#039;t be maturing and experiencing what he is at his age, its the loss of innocence due to tragedy which really sums up uso&#039;s character as a whole. Out of all the gundam this kid probably goes through the worst experiences and that really is saying alot in a franchise like this, and this hell he goes through really makes him a compelling character.<br />
<br />
Uso is a strong pro but he alone doesn&#039;t carry the show, he wasn&#039;t alone in his likability as the entire supporting cast(minus the doa characters mentioned above) was generally quite lovable and also experience a fair share of development with interesting and enjoyable personalities. Victory gundam still has action every single episode like the ones before it but the show felt like it has more focus on slower and contained moments of characters just interacting and talking, this really helped make the cast easier to grow attached to. I legitimately gave a shit about most of the cast and this really is what made victory gundam for me. The relationships between characters were actually enjoyable to see interact. Shatki the series heroine will get some differing opinions depending on the viewer though, she makes a few dumb decisions during the series that have led to some people disliking her but if you take a step back from our perspective her actions are more logical in her shoes and to her knowledge than to us the viewer who see the entire picture, I personally really liked her just like the rest of the cast but I will not deny some will find her off putting. Marbet and Odello whom make up the guardian archetype and the best friend archetype respectfully to the protagonist uso are particularly really memorable and undergo quite alot of development themselves.<br />
<br />
-Pacing: One of the things I immediately loved about victory gundam was its pacing, not because it was always exciting moving from one event to another but rather the complete opposite. It was able to slow down instead of jumping into one traumatic situation after another. This is something that really helped me appreciate the world, characters, as well as made it less tedious as this made victory gundam feel more dynamic as a series progression wise. It’s not a super slow series but it has a good sense of when to slow down and when to speed up. Though it must be mentioned that the pacing in the first 4 episodes is off because they are told out of order due to a classic case of executive meddling, long story short the gundam originally wasn’t meant to appear until episode 4 and the execs didn’t like that so they placed episode 4 first in its broadcast with the 3 episodes before that being told in a “how we got there” type of story.<br />
<br />
-Sense of morality: to me gundam 079&#039;s greatest strength was is showcase of how both sides of a war have people just fighting for what they believe is right, they have their reasons for doing what they do as well as have their own loved ones goals and ambitions. This strong aspect of 079 was immediately discarded come time for zeta and ZZ in favor of inhuman and absurd villains of zeta’s titans whom lacked any sense of humanity while ZZ  was being....well ZZ. Victory gundam was a return to form for this theme and it does it extremely well. Just like 079 it does have a small number of &quot;hurr durr im evil&quot; characters usually as higher ups giving order but it does an exceptional job humanizing the enemy army regardless. You’ll see enemy soldiers talking about their families, showing genuine care for fellow soldiers and civilians, and one thing I absolutely adored me was showcasing how they also express fear of death as well. This humanization of the enemy is also the main reason victory gundam is such a heartbreaking series as the deaths of such enemies (as well as allies) only make it more and more depressing, which in turn I believe makes victory gundam truly sell the horrors of war more so than any other gundam (aside from war in the pocket). Though there is one elephant in the room I must mention while praising its depictions of morality. That elephant&#039;s name is katejina loos. Katejina is essentially evil incarnate and her reasons behind why she is such a disgusting human being isn&#039;t really touched upon aside from her relationship with one other major antagonist. To me she’s like ghilren zabi from 079, in the midst of this army that share humanity among its soldiers is this unnaturally evil and insane one that your just desperately waiting for the protagonist to squish them with their mech. At the very least she does end up being an entertaining and effective villain as her sheer brutality and unstable nature leads to interesting conflicts but I still wish they at least tried to give her some sense of humanity as there is another character that goes batshit psycho by stories end and acts similarly to katejina but was more a tragic outcome of his/her experience that made them what they were in the end, katejina is just a bitch. <br />
<br />
-Tone/atmosphere: Thanks in part to its absolutely excellent ost which utilizes alot more softer sounding string driven music (youtube songs like &quot;the white ghost&quot; and &quot;shakti&quot; to get an idea of its feel) victory gundam does a great job of setting its tone. It can create a very dire atmosphere as well convey the depressing nature of the series whilst also leaving room for a feeling like not all hope is lost. The soundtrack is beautiful and in part really makes the series itself feel beautiful. As stated before this will occasionally be thrown off by some absurd moments here and there but ultimately I felt like victory gundam continually retains its feeling of dire and depressing atmosphere whilst not losing the prospect of there being the possibility of a better future, and that itself leads into one last thing that really makes victory gundam for me…<br />
<br />
-Hope for the future: I think its ironic how victory gundam is frequently regarded as the most grimdark in the franchise when it has the most focus put on how there is a hope for a more peaceful future, it goes out of its way to try and say that all these sacrifices and horrors experiences are not all for naught. The series is depressing and has a body count through the roof but it goes out of its way to showcase how the possibility of a better life is not lost. The way it expresses this is through the idea of the younger generation being able to carry the future from the ashes of war which is the main reason the cast is made up of large portion of young kids. People are not dying for nothing they are dying for the prospect of a future where the next generation wont have to experience the suffering the current one has, it idolizes the idea of new life and really sells through how this isn’t some hopeless situation but rather an opportunity to help those in the future. One specific scene in the 2nd to last episode which gets its own insert song specially for this one scene is the best example of why this theme of hope for the future is so important to the series and also stands as one of the best scenes in the entire show. <br />

I am not going to say victory gundam doesn&#039;t deserve the flack it gets as I hopefully made clear it does do things really wrong and those that label it with such a infamous label are fairly justified, its not for everyone but I do truly believe there is alot Victory does right and even exceptionally, its just a matter if you can tolerate its shortcomings. Its got its faults that will ruin the experience for some but I believe there is truly a beautiful story to be found here for those that are capable of forgiving its shortcomings. Speaking personally victory gundam was a heartbreaking and powerful story that was able to evoke legitimate emotions from me and while yeah I really wish parts of it were better handled or cut entirely I cant deny that after finishing the series looking back on it there was just so much of it I appreciated and loved about it, and hopefully there will be others willing to give this a shot and experience it the same way I have.<br />

    Gundam has always been a series I watch. I&#039;ve always been drawn to the Mecha Genre, the newer series are usually awesome in sound/animation but that doesn&#039;t mean we shouldn&#039;t give a chance to the older ones. Luckily for me Victory Gundam was actually enjoyable (unlike Z or ZZ)<br />
<br />
Story and Characters<br />
<br />
Story wise, Victory Gundam follows the generic gundam story line. Young hero, happens to &quot;fall&quot; into piloting the &quot;latest and greatest&quot; suit. Gets conscripted into fighting for adults whether willingly or unwillingly. Grows up, finds his own reasons to fight/not fight which usually includes a love interest somewhere. Goes to space, comes back to earth,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review13737">
        goes back to space and there is the inevitable big battle to end it all. <br />
<br />
Victory Gundam succeeds for three reasons.<br />
<br />
First - the character development is very well done. Unlike some heroes, Uso is actually both identifiable and likeable. The supporting cast of characters all have their own storyline and despite the fact that there are a lot of supporting characters somehow you grow to know (like or dislike) each and every one of them even the dog and baby. That&#039;s a smart dog. I want one just like him. Throw in a Haro too while you&#039;re at it. By the end of the series the baby is actually walking and starting to talk. How is that for true to life?<br />
<br />
Second - This portrays war in a realistic manner. It isn&#039;t one of those gundam series where people escape death all the time in fact, if I were to give a tagline to this series it would be &quot;In War People Die&quot;. I felt bad at 90% of the deaths and cried more than once. That is effective storytelling.<br />
<br />
Third - although there was the slow part, the story really picked up in the last 5 episodes and I probably enjoyed those more than the preceding 46. The ability to surprise, move the viewer and entertain at the end is the mark of good anime.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation<br />
<br />
Very dated with a lot of frame reuse, so was ok for its time but compared to current anime it really shows its age. Nothing special here and one reason why I couldn&#039;t give this anime a higher score.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
Pretty average OP/ED songs although Shakti&#039;s song was very catchy and the sad music really works. Sound effects were ok also.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
<br />
I only had 2 issues with this anime. First - Katejina (ugh!). Secondly, why is it in every Gundam Series the adults are all too willing to give their latest and greatest suit to some young, irresponsible fighter pilot ace? Ok the second reason is applicable to all gundam series but seriously if I were a captain I would NEVER let them pilot those suits until they were mature. <br />
<br />
That being said, although it took some time to finish it I liked this a lot. Completionists should watch this series.

    At one point Mobile Suit Victory Gundam was my most hated Gundam Show of all time. I hated the narrative and plot of Victory Gundam. I hated the characters, aboustly despite the pacing, hated the lack of actual substance of the show where characters would die randomly for no reason in the show and I hated the visuals for Victory Gundam as it’s very poorly animated and lack any detail. Even if Victory Gundam had a great soundtrack I still despise it for being a poorly animated and written shit show where I thought Gundam Seed Destiny, ZZ Gundam, and Gundam Build Fighters Try were

          <span style="display: none;" id="review283772">
        better written then Victory Gundam. That how much I despise it.<br />
<br />
However as soon I went to Gundam forums and facebook groups and I declared that Victory Gundam was the worst Gundam show ever made I got a lot of blackish from many hardcore Gundam fans who actually thought Victory Gundam was a good show. Many fans of the show thought me that I didn’t understand the show because the creator and director Tomino was going through depression and I should feel bad for him. Honestly I felt bad for Tomino that he was going  through depression but at the same time I thought Tomino should have abandoned the show halfway through and let another director take over the show because the show could have been a lot better and tolerable if the show changed directors halfway through but history is history and we cannot travel back in time to 1993 and change things around.<br />
<br />
As people continue to blackish me for my opinion of Victory Gundam as well them telling me to re-watch it again my friend contacted me about my opinion my Victory Gundam and he told me to come to his house to get his Victory Gundam Blu-Rays that were released by Nozomi Entertainment in the US. Since I live in the UK I had to borrow his small Region Free Blu-Ray player that allows Blu-Rays from the USA to be played. I ended up borrowing his Victory Gundam Blu-Rays and the Blu-Ray player for a month and when I was not busy with personal life I sat down and watched the whole thing in 5 sittings and by the end of my re-watch I was honestly I liked it the second time watching. Don’t get me wrong I don’t think it was a great show but at the same time, I don&#039;t think it was a bad show and am going to tell you why.<br />
<br />
Hello, everyone, this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcome to my review of Mobile Suit Victory Gundam and with that out of the way let’s get started.<br />
<br />
Story.<br />
It is the year UC 0153 90 years since the One Year War, 60 years since Char rebellion and 30 years since the Crossbone Vanguard the earth is still lossly controlled by the greatly weakened earth federation who are under attack by the BESPA the armed forces of the space colony-based Zanscare Empire. Only a ragtag resistance movement, League Militaire, stands in BESPA&#039;s way as they swiftly conquer much of space and start their invasion of Earth, with the advanced mass-produced mobile suit, the Victory Gundam, as the League Militaire&#039;s secret weapon. However, BESPA&#039;s power continues to grow, using violent means, including public executions with guillotines, to strike fear into those living on Earth.<br />
<br />
The story follows a 13th-year-old Uso Ewin who is living peacefully on earth with his childhood friend Shahkti in the Eastern European town of Kasarelia. However, the peaceful days would come to a end where they are thrown into a conflict when they encounter with they encounter ace BESPA pilot Chronicle Asher. Soon, Üso finds himself joining forces with Marbet Fingerhut and the rest of the League Militaire, Now Uso must pilot the Gundam so he can fight against the BESPA as well discovering the true horrors of war.<br />
<br />
The story of Victory Gundam begins in a very odd way because episode 1 is actually episode 4 while the episodes 2 to 4 were actually episodes 1 to 3, however, there was a reason for this awarkawd start. Around this time Bandi brought the rights to Gundam as well as Studio Sunrise and needless to say director Tomino aboustly hated it. The main reason why episode 4 was showed first instead of the actual episode 1 is so Bandai can promote the Victory Gundam mobile suit to increase model sales.<br />
<br />
The one thing that should know that Victory Gundam is easily the darkest Gundam show to date even surpassing Zeta Gundam and this is mostly due to the fact that director Tomino was suffering from depression where if you know the man well it leads to a kill them all series.<br />
<br />
Besides that what do I think about the story of Victory Gundam? Honestly, I thought it was just decent for the most part.<br />
<br />
For starters, I really like the tone of Victory Gundam for the most part as it perfectly captures the atmosphere of war in a more darker manner. Unlike all of the Gundam shows before and after  Victory, this one is mostly dead serious in terms of tone as it rarely has any lighthearted moments.<br />
I also really loved the themes that were explored in Victory Gundam such as betrayal, death, immigration, peace, and insanity and the show did a pretty great on exploring it&#039; themes without being too preachy about it.<br />
<br />
The final 12 episodes were Victory Gundam were pretty awesome overall as it was well paced had a lot of great elements which I won&#039;t mention due to spoilers, good writing great battles and the ending for Victory Gundam was great as it perfectly concludes the series in a sad but satisfying way.<br />
<br />
However, Mobile Suit Victory Gundam has a lot of problems.<br />
The first problem I had with Victory Gundam is the pacing. In terms of pacing Victory Gundam has some of the worst pacing I have ever seen in a Gundam show and while it’s not as bad as Wing and especially in Seed Destiny it’s still a big problem due to how nothing really important happens in the middle portion as it’s only featured a lot of repetitive fights in space.<br />
<br />
The second problem I had with Victory Gundam were the deaths themselves. While I liked of how Victory Gundam explored the theme of death the problem is the execution at times for example characters who got little to no screen time until that point suddenly become the focus of the episode have the audience to get attached to these character for they respective episodes only them to be killed off by the end of the episodes. The was okay in the beginning but it really got annoying and predictable as the series went on. Honestly, what is the point of putting characters in the spotlight if they are going to be killed in the end? <br />
This is just subpar writing and it really just toys with the audience emotions.<br />
<br />
The third problem that I had with Victory Gundam is how women were portrayed. I understand the writers tried to make Women as ruthless as men in a war setting however they writers really jumped the shark here because all the women in Victory Gundam are either ineffectual or unexplainably psychotic and because of that they were all really hard to sympathize with which is a huge problem in terms of characterization.<br />
<br />
The fourth and final problem with Victory Gundam was the despite being a dark Gundam series it was way unnecessarily over the top for its own good meaning the show would be too flashy about the deaths and other stuff in the show. It wasn&#039;t so bad in the first half but the second half really got carried away with it’s over the top nonsensical deaths to some of the cringe-worthy stuff like the Lupe bathtub scene in episode 29 which completely screwed up the tone of the series greatly.<br />
Beside those shortcomings, I thought the story for Victory Gundam was okay that had a lot of good themes and elements.<br />
6/10<br />
<br />
Characters.<br />
Like with the story the characters in Victory Gundam were decent for the most part.<br />
Uso is pretty good Gundam protagonist. Despite being the youngest protagonist in Gundam he maturely says otherwise as he develops as a very compelling character to struggles to prevent the death of his friends and comrades but can never keep people from dying no matter how very hard he tries not to mention he is a greatly skilled pilot.<br />
Shakti is probably my least favorite character in this show. While she was a decent chararter in the beginning but once she started to reach Lacus, Marina and Relena levels of annoyance and preachiness I started disliking her greatly.<br />
The characters in the league militare were decent and enjoyable characters overall however apart from Odelo who was a good character they were all pretty underdeveloped.<br />
<br />
While the Zanscare Empire as just as ruthless as the Titans in Zeta Gundam however unlike like Titans in Zeta Gundam where some of the characters were actually likable every character in the Zanscare Empire minus Cornicle and Katejina were lackluster.<br />
Chronicle Asher is the char clone of the series but is honestly not a good one. While he, not a good char clone I thought he was still a pretty decent chararter overall and I really liked his sympathy where he doesn’t like to target non-combatants but instead he rather order civilians away from areas of danger.<br />
Katejina is a pretty interesting character because she is probably the character that I enjoyed the most in this show. Yes, she did some unspeakable acts through the series that would make anyone angry but think I enjoyed about Katejina was her journey to madness. She went from your typical spoiled rich girl who worried about Uso safely due to he being young in the League Militaire to an utter psychopath where she switched sides with the Zanscare Empire after being captured by Chronicle.<br />
While I personally don’t like Katejina as a person thanks to her unspeakable acts I still liked how the show did with Katejina.<br />
Overall the characters in Victory Gundam were decent but enjoyable for the most part.<br />
6/10<br />
<br />
Visuals.<br />
For a show made in the early 90s, I thought the visuals of Victory Gundam were alright.<br />
The character designs were pretty good for the most part and I really loved of how the show was able to showcase different skin colors instead of the usual white skin characters that we all seen before in many. It really gives characters more diversity in terms of how they looked.<br />
As for the mecha designs, I thought there alright. I really loved the Victory Gundam and V2 designs as there were both original and great designs not to mention I really liked thy feature that they have such as V2 Wings of light.<br />
The mobile suit for the Zancare Empire were pretty weird of Gundam standards. While I give them points for trying to be original but some of them were outright ridiculous like the Gedlav.<br />
As for the actual animation, I thought is alright overall. While the show has no stock footage used and some of the fights were well animated I thought at times the show can get pretty choppy at times with its animation.<br />
6/10<br />
Sound.<br />
The soundtrack is great as it perfectly fits with the dark tone of the series.<br />
Both the opening and endings themes were pretty great overall yes they are very light-hearted compared to the rest of the show but I thought they were all great and catchy.<br />
The Seiuyuus did a great job with the roles that were given so I have no complaints whatsoever.<br />
Unfortunately like with ZZ, Turn A, and X victory Gundam does not have an English Dub.<br />
Overall the soundtrack and voice acting for Victory Gundam were pretty great.<br />
8/10<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts.<br />
So after re-watching Victory Gundam for the second time what I think about it?<br />
While I personally thought it wasn’t an amazing Gundam show by any stretch of the imagination I also thought it was not that awful. While I prefer to watch most of the other Gundam shows that came before and after it I find the experience of victory to be pretty enjoyable for the most part. It still has a lot of problems in terms of the story and characters but it wasn’t an insulting pile of shit like ZZ Gundam, Build Fighters Try and Seed Destiny was. I thought Victory Gundam was a decent Gundam show that had a lot of good things in it but it does it have the problems that prevent it from being one of the good ones.   The pacing was way too slow for its own good at times, it was way over the top with its themes at times and dark nature and some of the characters were not that good.<br />
<br />
Victory Gundam may get a lot of hate from non-UC Gundam fans and for very understandable good reasons mind you but I must remind you all that Victory Gundam wasn’t a total disaster. Victory Gundam had to potential to be awesome but sadly it was mismanaged and toyed with for the most part and because of that, this show ended up being a decent at best.<br />
<br />
If you haven’t seen any Gundam show before I recommend you to avoid it until you have seen most of the U.C Gundam shows that came before it in the timeline.<br />
<br />
After Victory Gundam was done director Tomino would be kicked off from the team and Victory Gundam would be the last U.C Gundam show from the timeline and for what it was I thought it was a decent end to a great timeline.<br />
Final Score 6/10

    Victory Gundam is known to be extremely depressing and for good reason, Tomino, the creator of the Gundam Franchise was depressed at the time because Sunrise was merging with Bandai and this is personally his most hated series and even said &#039;You are a fool for watching this&#039; But as a Gundam fan I felt it was my duty to watch this and I can see why he hates it so much. <br />
<br />
While Victory is a &#039;kill em all&#039; series, a lot of it was rather unpleasant to watch as there were a lot of deaths that were a little extreme like beheading, vaporized by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178029">
        a beam saber, and crushing your skull. Death is nothing new in the Gundam series but these were some pretty heavy killings and I wouldn&#039;t have much of a problem with it except for one thing which is that the main character Uso Erwin is only 13 years old, the youngest pilot at the time before Gundam AGE and all these things happen around him, its a little much for the series and of course the bath scene which I still find very unusual. <br />
<br />
The animation is nice and very smooth but for some reason, none of the characters or mech&#039;s have any shading, its a solid colour which didn&#039;t really bother me but it does stand out while you&#039;re watching the series. <br />
<br />
There are quite a few characters but I&#039;ll focus on the main 2 which are Uso and Shakti. Overall Uso is a likeable character with good traits and a skilled pilot, he does mature quickly in the series. Shakti however is probably one of the most hated if not most hated female lead because she constantly gets captured and actually sometimes goes to the enemy only for the league militaire to rescue her and suffer a casualty each time because of her. <br />
<br />
Overall the series pacing was pretty clustered at first but did have a good ending, the characters were likeable except 3 people overall and it did have a pretty decent Gundam.

    Victory Gundam is another Universal Century chapter in the Gundam franchise, only this one takes place years after the events of Char&#039;s Counterattack. The series effectively blends ideas from older UC titles that aired up to that point featuring a guerrilla faction opposing the powerful dictatorship (Zeta Gundam), a young boy forced to confront the realities of war (Gundam 0080) and the usual conflicts of war that arise between humans living in space and on Earth. The series expands on the &quot;youth forced to confront realities of war&quot; plot element with Uso and other children seen in Victory Gundam joining up in League Militaire&#039;s efforts

          <span style="display: none;" id="review69995">
        and coping with the merciless and crude situations faced by adults in fighting various deadly battles. The series explores the efforts of both League Militaire and the Zanscare Empire showing both sides to have their sympathetic and corrupt elements, especially as you come to learn more of the inner workings of Zanscare that rely on deception, manipulation of the masses via spiritual ideology and fear to maintain their society. With Yoshiyuki Tomino in the helm as Victory Gundam&#039;s director, the series is infamous for having the highest kill count among his direction of titles in the Gundam franchise and it shows as many among both warring factions in this series get killed off throughout the show&#039;s run.<br />
<br />
The series isn&#039;t without its rough elements for quality. The earlier episodes of Victory Gundam have some awkward structure in their narrative which mostly stems from Bandai&#039;s influence to introduce the titular Gundam of the series much earlier than originally planned for advertising reasons during the time it aired in Japan. There were also occasions when Uso would grate on my nerves for his angsting over fighting Zanscare forces, especially during heated moments when he is in the middle of battle and shouting at his foes while fighting. Victory Gundam also brings back the absurd Core Fighter concept used from the original Gundam series where the Gundam unit is divided up into head, torso and leg parts that it can assemble together while in midair. While this element has its unique moments where mobile suit pilots will abandon damaged parts to prevent the entire unit from being destroyed or implementing their divisions for battle tactics, suspension of disbelief is pushed a bit in seeing mobile suits fully assemble their parts in the middle of heated battle scenes.<br />
<br />
The visuals to Victory Gundam are standard for the time period that the series aired having subdued color tones, decent details on scenery and character designs, mobile suit designs looking a bit rough with drawn details and animation shortcuts being the norm for battle scenes. The insert music for the series does its part to compliment peaceful and tense moments seen throughout the show, but doesn&#039;t have anything memorable that stuck out for me. I did personally feel though that the musical choices for Victory Gundam first OP and ED sequences were a bit too upbeat and energetic with the type of plots that the Gundam franchise was known to depicting up to the point Victory had aired.<br />
<br />
Despite having its rough moments though, Victory Gundam made for a solid continuation of the Universal Century continuity of the Gundam franchise exploring Uso&#039;s involvements with League Militaire and coming to grips with the harsh realities of war as he deals with conflicting ideologies, betrayal and the loss of comrades. It is definitely worth a look if you are a fan of the Gundam franchise.

    WOW!!!! victory gundam talk about a tear jerker. well in this gundam series there was a lot of adventures and non-stop action. at first glance you&#039;d think this was a kiddy show but once you watch it&#039;ll surprise you. the downside to it is alot of tregedy&#039;s. but i think they ended The UC era with a bang i was actually satisfied when it ended.

    Even though Victory has a bad reputation, being the most depressing show in the franchise (i didn`t find it that depressing), as a show it was much more consistent than Double Zeta in terms of tone and quality. The characters are very likable and you will feel sad for many of them dying throughout the course of its 51 episodes. It may start off unimpressive, but it gets so much better later on. Tomino manages again to write quite psychotic antagonists, that are hard to empathize with on a subjective level but have so many layers of complexity that it is a joy to watch

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203558">
        them fall deeper and deeper into madness and dispair. That is especially true to some female characters, which gave Victory the reputation of a misogynist show, as the basic theme, especially at the end, centers around how female desires bring desaster. At this point Victory almost becomes a philosophical analysis on how war is strongly affected by the innate male and female desires. All that of cause, typical for Tomino Gundams, cummulates in a climactic finale that you won`t forget.<br />
All in all Victory is an amazing mecha ride. It may start off slow, but in the grand scale it may be almost on par with Zeta, well almost.<br />

    Victory Gundam is really quite something, not as a show but as a testament to everything that Tomino has done for gundam thus far. This would be the last main universal century title to come out, and tomino last gundam show for a while before coming back but on a different project. The reason i’m putting Tomino in such high regard is not because he was the director, but also the writer for all the early main gundams. To the point that his very being is integral for him making these shows. With each passing title it’s easier to see the motifs, tropes, and cliches

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281265">
        that people like tomino continually implement in their shows that give them their very own signature feel. The problem is that their not always good and victory gundam exemplifies all the good and bad qualities of a gundam show. Even without the meta-understanding of the series the show by itself has many problems. <br />
<br />
The problems with the show are apparent as soon as the first episodes, as the way it was structured is shaky at best.  The show has two timelines, while it really isn’t that confusing, it really offers nothing interesting that couldn’t have been done by going in a linear fashion. the only reason this could have been is to show off the gundam early so that people aren’t confused they are watching the wrong show since it would have taken several episodes for the iconic mech to appear. The show does pick itself up after a few more episodes and it becomes easy to notice how the show is very similar to many of his previous gundam works. While it doesn’t inherently make the show bad it does make it difficult to watch something that has been done before. Thankfully the show does add a bit to the show starting with the setting initially taking place on earth and being presented more as a historical work than a Sci-Fi as there are many historical analogs depicted in the factions. It also tries more to depict the Minutiae of battle to a certain amount of extent than its predecessors. Yet despite all this the show quickly falls on its face again and this becomes a common cycle throughout the entire show. <br />
<br />
The most noticeable failing would be the character deaths mostly on how the characters were handled, and their are a lot of named character deaths. The trend shows itself early on after the introduction of the shrike team as many of them are killed off with only a smidge of personality. Their deaths may have been fine just as that, but the show makes a grand deal about this with the way it was shot, the blaring sad music, and the crying characters. While it may be tragic and could be argued that it’s in service of the characters that are still alive, it still does nothing for the viewers. While there may be sympathy for their deaths the fact that they don’t have enough development of being actualized tangible characters makes it difficult to empathize or reach a higher level of emotional investment. This doesn’t happen all the time as it’s more of a hill and valley situation but it’s still a lot of character deaths, and as more time progress after each episode it’s easy to realize how forgettable many of the character deaths are. <br />
<br />
As the story continues with the cast moving into space, and back to earth there is some credit to be given as there are some refinement to the formula of the show. While the plot make sometimes feel a bit erratic with sudden shifts in objective it still manages to keep a sense of cohesion that was lacking in the previous shows. The show also has a bit more downtime between the action so that the show doesn’t just feel like a sporadic mess of mech-battles. The shame is that they are never used to their fullest extent to develop the characters which the show really needed. So while not perfect there is a clear sense of progression even if it wasn’t handled that well.<br />
<br />
As the show started to head towards its final act there was one word to describe this show with Katejina being a prime example, and it’s that the show is very abrupt. There are times when there are transitions that make no sense and it takes time to get my barring of what was going on. While there may have been logic behind what was happening there was never a follow through before it happened that destroys the flow of the story. The reason katejina is the example is her entire betrayal to the zanscare empire. While there may have been some logic to it the way it transitioned her character was terrible with it being mostly a few throw away lines before we see her again fully changed. It’s parts like those where i feel like a miss something and when going back i find nothing at all, and it was just a sudden change and makes the show more difficult to follow with. <br />
<br />
Victory was made during the cusp of the japan bubble burst that hampered their economy and i feel that it may have affected the quality of the anime. The show feels like a regression of art style as it’s quality feels like something that would have made between 079 and Zeta. it doesn’t have the cartoonish characters or plastic like mechs of gundam, but it also doesn’t have the more detailed look of the character and mechs of zeta. Still that character designs for many of the characters are still appealing and the mechs look decent even if some of them are dumb like the insect themed bespa suits. The animation for the show is good enough as well but there are noticeable dips with obvious tricks to give a sense of movements and many stilted frames that feel jarring to watch. The audio for the show is decent with the voice acting and sound effects being passable less because it’s bad performance, but because it may have been recorded on a poor device. Still the soundtrack is good with the orchestrals adding more thrill to the battles, and overall bringing some emotion to the show. <br />
<br />
While the show may be over hated, i do see the reasons why. From it’s abrupt plots and character development, mostly shallow characters, and seemingly poor production quality.<br />
Not to mention watching this after more than 3 main series with the similar formula ,and the refinement of the repetition not being substantial enough to really warrant watching this. Victory just ends of being an ok-ish enough show not worth remembering.

    Victory Gundam is just one of the numerous shows in the Gundam franchise, but has the notable distinction of being the last television series to take place in the Universal Century timeline. While this is the same universe that iconic Gundam characters like Amuro and Char lived in, it is so far in the future that there really isn’t a need to be familiar with earlier Gundam shows (although you may get a little more out of it if you have seen previous UC shows).<br />
<br />
The show stars Uso Ebbing, a 13-year old boy who lives in Europe and is suddenly brought into the conflict between

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213024">
        the Zanscare Empire, a powerful military force that originates from the colonies, and the League Militaire, a small resistance force from Earth. As with any other show from this franchise, Uso’s claim to fame is piloting the hero’s powerful mobile suit, the Victory Gundam and helping defend his friends and allies from the Zanscare Empire.<br />
<br />
The show is a mixed bag for many. I’ve heard some people who think it’s one of the franchise’s best shows, I’ve heard others who think it’s among the worst. It is definitely one of the show’s most polarizing. The show is known in particular for two things, its absolute brutality and the sheer absurdity of some of the show’s sequences. An often-said rumor on the web is that director Yoshiyuki Tomino was really upset at the time over the sale of Sunrise to Bandai, so he purposely made the show really ridiculous and over the top in an attempt to kill the franchise. I wouldn’t be surprised if said rumor has no facts behind it (as most web rumors), but does the show often come off as one where the director had that mentality? Yes.<br />
<br />
A common theme of UC Gundam shows is the effects of war and how rough it can be and this show is constantly pummeling you with that theme. Only a few episodes into the series an enemy soldier finds out that he’s been fighting the 13-year old Uso. He’s so upset that the war has forced little kids like him to fight that he pulls out a grenade and blows himself up. There are a group of characters introduced into the show with the express purpose of being killed one after another, often right in front of Uso. Episode after episode ends with him sobbing over the latest horror that has occurred. To make it even worse, the show frequently has a character die only to work into the storyline something that makes their death pointless. There’s a particular moment in the show when there is a major death which is done in the most brutal fashion imaginable. As if this isn’t enough, they reveal moments later that there was a cease fire declared and if things just happened slightly differently, it never would have happened. The moment in question is arguably the most brutal in the entire Gundam franchise and I’ve known of people that have thrown up their hands and quit the show in response.<br />
<br />
From the opposite end, the show has several scenes in it that can only be described as complete absurdity. Two scenes in particular are really famous among the fandom; the first being when an enemy soldier tries to interrogate Uso by getting naked and going into a bathtub with him, and another when a group of women in bathing suits are sent to attack Uso while he’s in his Gundam and are promptly killed by him. Both scenes are completely nonsensical yet somehow made it into the show without ending up on the cutting board floor. There is a lengthy set of episodes where the Zanscare episode are using giant wheel themed ships which are among the strangest designed in the franchise and a style we never really get again in Gundam. These are just a few examples of the absurdities that this show throws towards us.<br />
<br />
The show has its share of both strong and extremely annoying characters. Uso is a likable protagonist and you really feel for all the things he goes through. Uso’s friend Katejina undergoes a transformation into one of the most heinous villains of the franchise and her character is one of the highlights of the show. On the other hand another friend of his, Shakti, often makes mind boggling decisions and you often get very frustrated with the character but know that she is so critical to the plot that she will continuously be there and there’s no avoiding her. <br />
<br />
Story-wise, the show is pretty strong but takes a while to get going. The first 10 or so episodes should have been greatly compressed. You also run into a problem in that the first episode should technically be the fourth, but the sponsors forced the show to move around the order to get the titular Gundam in the first episode, making the start of the show very confusing to watch. But once you get beyond this the pace is usually pretty quick. Neither the animation or the design is a big highlight; the show is the first in the Gundam franchise to lack the interesting character designs of either Yoshikazu Yasuhiko or Hiroyuki Kitazume. The often insectoid-type mecha are a bit different than Gundam shows past, but at the same time it is hard to think of many mobile suits that are memorable, whereas I consider there to be many from earlier shows. The show has several strong opening theme songs although they kind of mask just how rough the show really is.<br />
<br />
I think the show leaves a big emotional impression on you, and is generally worth a viewing for that reason alone. Other than being probably the darkest and most brutal show of the franchise, there aren’t aspects that I can say that single this show out as one that you have to see above all the others. It is more accessible than other Gundam shows but is likely to not be a good choice for your first Gundam show. It’s a memorable show for me, but I can see that many may not feel the same way.<br />

    Mobile Suit Victory Gundam is an anime television program set in the fictional universe of the Gundam franchise&#039;s Universal Century timeline. It consists of 51 episodes, and was directed by Gundam creator Yoshiyuki.<br />
<br />
Victory Gundam is set in UC 0153, and succeeds the Federation and Crossbone Vanguard conflict of Gundam F-91. Therefore, it takes place well after the events of the Earth Federation versus Principality of Zeon conflict (which could be said to have ended with Char&#039;s Counterattack).<br />
<br />
The greatly weakened Earth Federation comes under attack by the BESPA forces of the spaceborn Zanscare Empire; only the AEUG-like League Militaire stands in their way. The mass-produced Victory

          <span style="display: none;" id="review12694">
        Gundam is the League Militaire&#039;s secret weapon against the invading BESPA.<br />
<br />
I watched most of the gundam series there are and i must say its not high up my list. And im a kind of guy that likes nice graphics and this series is a bit older,so its not very good in this aspect too. I watched it because i ran out of Gundams to watch. I sugest watching it if you are in same situation..gundam lover running out of gundams to see.

    So Tomino was kinda sorta pissed off about what happened to F91. Either way, while his relationship with Sunrise had some cracks, it still wasn’t enough to completely sever it… at least until Bandai came along and bought Sunrise. Thus, Tomino was kinda under lots of pressure which caused him to fall into depression… again! Thus, he did everything in his power to piss them off during what would be his final show before being fired: Mobile Suit Victory Gundam. So, let’s dig into this mess.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
I once heard that a writer’s mood can sometimes affect the show they’re writing. I’m not sure if that’s entirely

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308724">
        true (I mean, Urobutcher seems like a pretty stable guy and look at all the stuff he’s written) however it definitely holds true for Victory Gundam. This show is freaking depressing. To wit, death counts are high (To the point the Next Episode previews don’t even bother to hide them at times), the general tone is rather bleak, and overall, it’s not a very happy show.<br />
<br />
However, the darkness often doesn’t feel earned. Like, it’s a show that tries to be dark, but it’s dark in an almost juvenile and frankly stupid manner. Like the kind of stuff an edgy 15 year old would find dark. What’s even worse is that the comedy in this show is borderline childish at points, with jokes that, while they would be funny in a more lighthearted series), feel out of place and are simply not funny at all.<br />
<br />
It’s a shame too, as beneath all of these issues; the plot beneath it is actually pretty good. It’s got its flaws (The midpoint feels like if the pacing slowed down to a crawl) but there are multiple moments that do leave an impact on me, and for good reason. In general, this is a prime case of a good plot that is bogged down by the way it is presented.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
They’re a mixed bag. Usso I actually really liked. At first I was scared we would have another Al, but Usso quickly proved himself to be very mature for his age, and his constant frustrations on everyone around him dying was one of the show’s highlights. I also liked some of the other League Militaire characters, with Marbet and Oliver being probably my favorites of the whole lot, and their relationship was kinda cute all things considered.<br />
<br />
The rest were the mixed part in this bag lies. I honestly didn’t care much for the Zanscare Empire members. Most of them were frankly unmemorable, and the few that weren’t were memorable for all the wrong reasons, particularly Chronicle Asher, one of the worst Char Clones in the franchise. I think the only one I actually liked was Katejina for how batshit insane she was.<br />
<br />
But the winner of worst character is the show is (Say it with me folks) Shakti Kareen! You know how I hated Lacus, Marina and Pre-Endless Waltz Relena? Well, Shakti started all of those trends and she too sucks. I have nothing against pacifists, but there’s a difference between being a pacifist and being an idiot, and she falls into the latter. This is not helped by how often she gets kidnapped, which is quite a few times to say the absolute least.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
<br />
Overall the show looks fine for the early 90’. The problem with it is simply how the often just end up not shading anything, which can make the visuals feel extremely dull, like if it was something that came out of the 80’. That said, whenever the show stops messing around and starts shading things, it looks freaking amazing, especially for the time. So yeah, not a bad looking show, but not great either.<br />
<br />
The Mecha:<br />
<br />
They’re another mixed bag. I like most of the League Militaire MS, however the ones for the Zanscare Empire are borderline ridiculous, and not in a good way. That said, the titular Victory Gundam is pretty good, and the V2 Gundam is also nice in its own way, with both its Assault and Buster Upgrades doing wonders to the suit’s overall design. And once it gains the Assault Buster upgrade, it becomes a wonderful mess.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is pretty good, often dark and foreboding, with the exception of the Opening themes, which are deliciously lighthearted. Overall, I didn’t care much for “Don’t Stop Carry On” but I did love “Stand Up To The Victory”, and the same goes to the two Ending themes, “Winners Forever” and &quot;Moichido Tenderness&quot;<br />
<br />
Voice Acting:<br />
<br />
The cast is pretty good. This was Sakeguchi Daisuke’s debut role (Midorikawa Hikaru still envies him for that) and he does a pretty good job as Usso, selling the character’s youthfulness without making him annoying, though due to Gintama’s existence it was hard to take him seriously. While I wasn’t a fan of his character, the Late Great Dan Tomoyuki did a fine job as Asher. That said, there is one Seiyuu I didn’t care much for: Koorogi Satomi. Now, she had three roles, but two of them are fine. The other however is that annoying as fuck baby who would never stop crying. And yeah, it’s annoying. Besides them, there’s also Umezo Hideyuki, Matsumoto Rica, Takato Yasuhiro, Watanabe Kumiko and Takichi Fumihiko.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Victory Gundam is very much a love it or hate it sort of show. I myself liked it just fine, but it’s that fact that prevents me from easily recommending it. So yeah, unless you’re a diehard Gundam fan, I wouldn’t recommend watching it. And even if you are, I can only recommend it as a curiosity.<br />
<br />
Final Score: 6/10

    Being a Gundam fan for years, the only shows I&#039;ve watched in entirety were Wing, and Build Fighters, before starting a complete watch with my partner a few years ago. Watching what came before Victory was highly enjoyable, and I love so many of the characters and other series, but Victory wasn&#039;t anything like the ones before it.<br />
<br />
Story -- 3/10 (poor) <br />
<br />
For being a Gundam series, the story was driven by the MC piloting the Gundam, and stopping the enemy, which is every series&#039; base plot. Why I didn&#039;t rank it higher was due to specific characters and influences in the show. The entire plot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331302">
        was not very cohesive and left me wondering really what was happening at some parts. I know that the MC is supposed to develop, but the story made him (a 13 yr old kid) into a man way too fast.<br />
<br />
Art -- 3/10 (poor) <br />
<br />
The art was well, very lacking. For most other series, the artwork and backgrounds, and even the facial features are conveyed so well, but in Victory Gundam, everything seemed too rushed and simple, like they didn&#039;t even care - and it shows.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10 (mediocre) <br />
<br />
As much as I enjoy the OSTs of the other series, this one didn&#039;t have that much, save for a noted battle theme, and a few character themes sprinkled throughout, as well as the 2 OPs and 2 EDs, which are highly misleading for the series as a whole. The strange feeling of silent scenes was very apparent here.<br />
<br />
Character -- 4/10 (decent) <br />
<br />
Here we go. The only reason why I marked this section as a 4 is due to only two characters. One is Odelo, a supporting character who enriches the MC with his upbeat and often love-struck personality, and the other is Chronicle, the main antagonist to the MC and Victory&#039;s &quot;Char&quot; model. Though I enjoyed those two, I&#039;ll first touch on the few &quot;bad&quot; characters I disliked.<br />
<br />
The MC, Uso Ewin, is only 13, I repeat, ONLY 13. (Probably the youngest pilot?) and his introduction is well enough okay for the series beginning, but as we get further, he experiences things no child/young teen should ever go through. (though, this is a Gundam series so it&#039;s inevitable) He watches one of the people responsible for him piloting the Gundam die, as well as other &quot;fodder&quot; characters die, and this is a stupid attempt at making him grow by experiencing loss in order to become the man the show needs him to be. The deaths are so dumb, and you can tell when a character is going to die due to certain scenes, and words reflected in their actions, and it becomes stale and unenjoyable after the third death.<br />
<br />
A supporting character, Shakti, was obviously someone Uso had ties with, as a friend. But did she have to come along on the ship? NO, she didn&#039;t -- but she was used as a driving force for Uso to accomplish the goals needed to move the plot (or what little plot there was). She was very annoying with her attitude of &quot;no fighting needs to happen if I can just talk with the enemy.&quot; and she&#039;s often kidnapped to force the Gundam team to fight. Honestly, I hated her and just wished she&#039;d die.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment -- 4/10 (decent) <br />
<br />
As much as I was ready to go into this thinking it was great, I was misled. At first, I enjoyed it and then seeing the enemy mobile suits made me think twice, but both I and my partner sat through the most unsurprising 51 episodes and are glad it&#039;s over. My partner even walked away at the few recap episodes, and I almost skipped them myself. It was all over the place, and the only real sense of enjoyment came when Odelo was on screen.<br />
<br />
Overall -- 3/10 (poor)<br />
<br />
Even if you&#039;re a hardcore fan, please don&#039;t expect this show to be anything like its predecessors or even what comes after. You&#039;ll be let down and underwhelmed. It has the Gundam name, but not the quality we&#039;ve come to expect. Victory Gundam is one show I&#039;ll likely never watch again.

    This is the last gundam series I have seem that had anything to do with the universal century timeline. I was skeptical at first. Because I purchased tje dvd boxset off eBay, back in 2012. And I literally just finished watching it. So, it took me eight long years to watch this anime and I ended up watching the entire series on my amazon firestick. So, thus begins my review of the series. It&#039;s the second gundam series that I have watched that had to do with the whole crew being young children. This gundam series in fact, the entire crew may have been a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369922">
        lot younger then the other gundam series that I watched that had nothing to do with the universal century timeline. But, this was a pretty amazing series with the main character being the youngest newtype I have seen by far ever to pilot a gundam. And his ability to adapt and overcome every obstacle in his path truly astonished me. I really enjoyed this gundam series with parts even almost making me tear up. So, there were parts that were obviously very emotional for me. I really liked this series. Even though I thought some parts were childish, but it had some comedy to make up for that lack of maturity. Overall it was a boy&#039;s journey into manhood.

    --NO MAJOR SPOILERS--<br />
<br />
V Gundam is a…weird series to rank. It’s a series that at times feels like an unnecessary addition to the UC timeline mostly retreading old ground with a rather cartoonishly evil at times group of villains. Other times it is incredibly well written showcasing tragedy and empathy for your fellow man even in war times very well. In general, it is very much one of Tomino’s dark series and brings with that for better or worse his general insanity and sometimes just unintentionally, hilariously, bad writing too. Despite all this though, I very much enjoyed V Gundam for the most part.<br />
<br />
The story is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review423902">
        your typical Gundam one of a small, guerilla-esque force that is rebelling against some oppressive government. The stakes in general are handled well, and it always feels like there’s some threat for our protags. The whole idea of Mariaism is a bit silly and not really grounded in any real ideology like Zeon somewhat was, and ultimately is just a way for Zanscare officials to manipulate the queen and do le corrupt/bad things.  There is also a LOT of death in this series, and usually I didn’t really find them sad or engaging. I did find the characters reacting to the deaths and grieving to be extremely well done, and it feels like sometimes poor boy Uso just lives to suffer. Pacing is goodish overall, sometimes it definitely felt like it was dragging for the sake of hitting that four cour goal, but overall it feels engaging. There’s a lot of repeated stuff and ideas here that aren’t entirely as well executed as previous Gundam series, but the story still keeps the heart of what makes Gundam special for the most part. Also unimportant, but I want to say I find if funny and unique just how useful Haro is here. The little ball bot actually saves the lives of our cast more than once, and overall actually has a presence in this series compared to others where their just sorta there to be cutesy mascots.<br />
<br />
Characters are a mixed bag writing wise. I think Uso is genuinely very well written, and is very high on my list of fave Gundam protags. He suffers and goes through so much, but still refuses to not see the good in people or hope that his enemies and humanity can change. He ends up probably having the highest kill count of any pilot at the end of the series, all while being the youngest Gundam pilot still as of right now. Man will probably have trauma and PTSD for years, but ultimately he gets a happier ending than other Gundam protags. <br />
<br />
The side cast and antagonists range from solid to kind of bad. Shakti I want to like, but she feels like a plot device at times. Marbet is a good char overall, and is a great motherly figure. The Strike team is…ok ig overall? Most just felt like they were there to pad the roster, and their uh “development” was pretty predictable. Odelo is a nice older kid type char who keeps Uso and the other kids in check, while still needing to be put in his place by the adults sometimes. The rest of the side cast is ok, I don’t have anything really to say about them.<br />
<br />
The antagonists are very much mixed. Chronicle is basically Jerid 2.0, I like him well enough. He’s kind of a loser rival a bit, but he has some good moments. Faula I thought could be a good Haman-esque char, and then she’s just wack later on. Katejina is just chaotic evil hoe that is amusing, but ultimately not that well written of a char imo. Lupe is laughably bad, and the rest are mostly just cartoonishly evil. However, something you’ll notice through V Gundam is that it’s really good about having certain soldiers that will be around for 1-3 eps tops. However what the story does with them is excellent as far as war being a horrific, tragic thing, and there’s often inevitable but touching scenes with them that Gundam is known for and V Gundam delivers well on that.<br />
<br />
Both OPs and EDs are pretty catchy, and general soundtrack is nice. Uso was Daisuke Sakaguchi’s breakout role, and he really does an excellent job voicing Uso here. The sheer emotional range he has works very well. The rest of the cast is voiced well, and I’d like to specifically mention Chronicle’s va being Tomoyuki Dan who did a great job as Chronicle, but unfortunately passed away back in 2013. <br />
<br />
The art and animation overall is actually pretty consistently nice. I noticed less reused stock footage overall compared to other Gundam series of its time, and the art has that timeless 90s look to it. Character designs keep the classic feel of Gundam series before it. The mech and ship designs are…oh geez where do I even begin lol. The wheel mechs and suits are very much an acquired taste, but I think they’re so dumb and silly they loop around to being interesting and most certainly unique almost in a G Gundam sense. The V Gundam itself being a combiner mech makes for some interesting combat situations, and the V2 is very nice looking. The V2’s wings of light I loved a lot specifically. Grunts suits work nice, and in general V Gundam has some of the most odd but truly unique suits in the franchise. <br />
<br />
V Gundam, like its wheel mechs, are very much an acquired taste. You might have to stick with it for a while before you truly like it. Yes there’s a few really bad eps writing wise, and in general the writing quality isn’t as good as the Gundam shows that came before it. However, it still has a lot of what makes Gundam good and I’d rec any Gundam fan to still check it out. 7.5/10. Stand up to the Victory baby.<br />
