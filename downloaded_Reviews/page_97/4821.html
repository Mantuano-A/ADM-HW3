    When the anime was announced I was wondering how would it be to take Nekopara to the small screen. At first I was enthusiastic because is not usual to see an eroge getting an animated adaptation for TV , we all know that is exclusively reserved for outstanding series (Grisaia no Kajitsu, Yosuga no Sora, Fate/Stay Night, etc.) and the nekos utterly deserved it. Everything sounds good up to this point.<br />
<br />
Regardless of the massive change of voice actors and the evident removal of any sexual topics (except for Cinnamon&#039;s delusions), I was expecting a fun-loving show with a good deal of moe and it&#039;s fair

          <span style="display: none;" id="review329708">
        share of romantic-comedy. It was meant to be Kashou working hard in order to fulfill his dreams with the catgirls ready to learn, mature and enjoy their lives alongside him and his little sister just like what we saw in the game. Unfortunately, what I received turned out to be quite different from what I was expecting.<br />

It was not just the hentai, but also the romance was taken out of the setting. I understand that Felix Films does this to focus on the comedy and the slice-of-life since the anime features a different plot from the volumes, but without romantic scenes the adaptation loses a crucial part of what it was originally meant to recreate, the Nekopara we all know and adore. That was the moment I felt I was watching the wrong show.<br />
<br />
Although I already felt disappointed on the anime at some extent, I still liked the debut of the new character. Cacao was the best gift this anime could have ever given to us, apart from the OP and the ED. I am the first to plead guilty of falling for her cuteness and innocence and I dare to state that there is no one who disliked the anime because of her. Cacao is a cutie pie truth be told, and that is precisely why I cannot help but feel sad about her just as soon as I remember that her happy tales will end with the last episode of the TV show. After that we will only hope to see her in artworks and merchandising stuff given the fact that she is a character created specially for the anime, unless they do with her the same that DC did with Harley Quinn and turn her into a canon character. And I pray that never happens for obvious reasons (her purity must remain untouched at all cost!).<br />
<br />
At this rate I thought that was it for me, but I encouraged myself to put all these issues aside so I can enjoy the anime as the regular kawaii show it was trying to be but whitout putting effort into it, I begun to find other unfavorable aspects of which I absolutely cannot find a reasonable explanation no matter how many times I think of them. Kashou gradually loses any participation and barely appears in scene in spite of being &quot;the protagonist&quot; and the one responsible of the patisserie. Regarding this last observation, Cinnamon and Vanilla are overly obsessed with Maple and Chocola (even more than how they are in the games) but Chocola and Shigure are not that keen on Kashou, ripping two main elements of their most important motivation, the very same one that made them set the beginning of the story. And to top it all of... apart from Kashou, it is absolutely rare to see other men or even boys in scene. Can someone please explain me what is the logic of this? What is this? Infinite Stratos? It doesn&#039;t make sense, not in the least.<br />
<br />
The manga was the first failure of the series being cancelled after just one volume. This, the anime adaptation and the upcoming mobile game proves that NEKO WORKs is starting to abuse of its popularity and that cannot be anything but bad news. As a fan it is not easy for me to say this, but considering all of the above, it is fair to say that they should have focused on the PC games instead.<br />
<br />
I am the kind of person who never drops an anime once it has started watching it, and that goes doubly for an adaptation of a series I have been following from long ago. I will watch this show until the very end, but if I have to be honest, I doubt I will change my mind about mentioning that this anime is not worth one&#039;s while.<br />
<br />
Love Nekopara, not so much the anime. All what is left to do now is wait for Vol. 4.

    Wow, I can’t believe that the anime of the decade has come out so soon!!!<br />
<br />
I never thought in my wildest dreams that frickin Nekopara of all things, a bare bones visual novel featuring sex scenes with incredibly well animated cat girls named after foods, would ever get an anime. But thanks to the wallets of an agglomeration of weebs of culture who were somehow able to raise over 1 million dollars for this anime’s creation, Nekopara the anime was conceived. And that my friends is why this is the anime of the decade, because it represents the dedication and perseverance of countless anime and visual

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332891">
        novel fans out there. It truly brings a tear to the eye…*sniff*…I’m so proud of this degenerate community! Maybe next time they&#039;ll even consider using their cash on actual real life women!<br />
<br />
Oh wait, was I supposed to actually talk about the anime itself? Uh…it’s basically the most simplistic slice of life you’ll ever come across. They introduce a new catgirl character that the main girls look after, and…yeah, not much of anything really happens to be completely honest. But hey, this anime features cute catgirls doing cute catgirl things, so it OBVIOUSLY gets an automatic “10/10 would fap to catgirls again” from me!<br />
<br />
Now despite everything, Nekopara could have actually been even better believe it or not. While Nekopara has everything that a Noble man could ever want, there are in fact two ways that this anime could have actually transcended perfection.<br />
<br />
1. If it featured sex scenes for the viewing pleasure of degenerates like myself.<br />
2. The cat girls were actually real and living with me in my home.<br />
<br />
But of course, there’s always the visual novel to fulfill #1 and Elon Musk to genetically engineer the cat girls for #2, so basically, all is right in the world and Nekopara is one of the most significant and enlightening creations of the century.<br />
<br />
This review hurts me on a metaphysical level because of how short, simplistic, sarcastic, and childish it sounds. But hey, that’s kinda exactly like Nekopara itself, so I guess it fits!

    Winter 2020 has been a pretty dismal season for anime overall. Eizouken will of course run away with anime of the season because it had exactly ZERO competition that could stop it. It doesn’t matter how boring, self-indulgent, or repetitive it is. Yuasa directed it and Eizouken has a budget, so compared to the rest of the Spring 2020 lineup it’s like watching Canelo Alvarez fight a bunch of children. My personal anime of the season is Interspecies Reviewers, but I can’t review that for a few more days. Instead, let’s look at a series that apparently met Funimation’s high moral standards. This is the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332903">
        bizarre dumpster fire known as Nekopara. <br />
<br />
So what the fuck is a Nekopara? Well you see, Nekopara is a shitty H-game from 2014. For the first 2 years, absolutely no one gave a fuck, but then in 2016-2017 it became a popular gag gift on Steam. A shitty game that’s really cheap, so you buy it during a steam sale and gift it to your friend as a joke, knowing that they will probably never play it. Yet SOMEHOW, this piece of shit got an anime adaptation. Why didn’t Big Rigs get an anime adaptation? Why didn’t Bad Rats get an anime adaptation? <br />
<br />
So why complain about Nekopara? It’s just porn after all! Just shut the hell up and enjoy the cat boobs and literal pussy! You can’t, because the anime removed all the H content and decided to bank on the strong plot and characters. You read that right. This is a game where humanoid cat girls are sent via post to some chef and must help out in his restaurant. In the game he of course bangs these girls, despite the fact they’re only 4 years old and have the minds of children. In the anime, they just kind of hang out and do…nothing. There are tons of slice of life shows where basically nothing happens, but Nekopara sets a new low bar. Since the anime isn’t a porn, I end up having to think about the stuff the writer didn’t want people to think about. Where did these catgirls come from? What is the history of Mankind’s interaction with this species? They seem to have roughly human intelligence and can speak Japanese fluently, but they count as pets and legally as property. It’s not all bad being a cat slave though. The girls get a pretty bell necklace when they learn not to run away. Can’t have your harem of catgirls getting Drapetomania! <br />
<br />
Did I mention this series got over 1 million dollars via crowdfunding? How is that even possible? I can only assume that some basement dweller used his bitcoin wealth that he collected playing Warcraft 10 years ago. I know I bang on about this in too many reviews, but half of Spice and Wolf and over half of Baccano were never adapted! There are SO many good anime that need another season, but Nekopara is what makes its crowdfunding goals and gets made. Also fuck Funimation for picking this up, dubbing it, and distributing this instead of Reviewers. Gen Fukunaga should be tied to a bed and forced to spend a passionate evening with Elza the hyena girl!<br />

    Nekopara is one of the only VN series ive completed and eventhough it had its ups and downs.. it was well crafted and its eroge element aside.. it was a series that actually made me get closer and like most of its characters the more i played it... and i was looking forward to this anime ever since it was announced... but all it left me was in complete disappointment<br />
<br />
Existed Setting:<br />
So....what was planned here was an anime which took away the eroge and have a bigger focus on the moe aspect of the VNs..which is an idea i genuinely like and its the way that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331076">
        i think that a Nekopara anime should be made as...and they have in their hands a material can serve to be one of the best moes of all time...this series wouldnt have been popular if it was just a mindless eroge otherwise... but unfortunately... somehow... they ruined it.... apart from its well done first episode... almost everything else this anime offered was nothing but a total disaster...first thing it gets wrong.. is the fact that is completely sideline&#039;s its suppose to be main character Kashou Minaduki....who had been a great character where you could put your own shoes in his and experience the setting of Nekopara first hand... instead, it puts all the nekos in the main role...but unfortunatly, none of them have strong enough personalities to fit a main role... they are loveable yes but that is not enough to be in the main seat... and the fact that it tries to present both the settings of the La Soleil Cafe and the Minaduki Household at the same time definitely hurt since here.. it definitely bit of way more than it can chew...where as the VNs take a slower approach in focusing on the cafe setting a whole lot more,the anime tries to do both of them equally and fails to do neither of them particularly well...<br />
<br />
New Setting:<br />
So..in brief.. it fails to present the already existing setting to both the anime onlys as well as the VN players...so what about the new additions....that is one small bright spot in this anime... the new addition being Cacao....was the one of the best thing that happened to this series so far.. both VN and animewise... her debut was great and every moment that showed her perspective and how she adapted to them was a joy to watch and that one ep were she ventures out on her own and finds a friend was great and it was heartwarming... but unfortunately thats all there is to even for Cacao so far.. since after that.. she is integrated into the main cast and has nearly no such great moments... at least until the 9th ep so far.. hence eventhough there is some good in this anime..its too far in few between<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
This has to be the biggest shortcoming of the anime.....since this anime is completely free of the VNs eroge element....some of the character personalities had to be translated to fit that bill... but unfortunately...character personalities were either tweaked to the worse or completely removed....Chocola and Vanilla in particular.. are shadows of theirselves in the VN.. they are as loveable yes but they are nowhere as good as their VN portrayal.. Coconut and Azuki are worse off since the anime took away all the development Vol 2 did on them and just made them into 1 dimensional rivals who fight over the most petty of things... i loved this about their character in the VN but the anime just portrayed it as annoying and unneccesary.. and then u got Maple who had the entirety of Vol 3 shoved into the span of 1 ep since the anime couldnt figure out what to do with her.. and then u got the worst of them all..Cinammon and Shigure... i disliked these 2 in the VN since they were so annoying...but the anime made me hate them... since Cinammon had her personality transfer over to the anime without any change... which wouldve been bearble in an eroge setting but is completely out of place in a moe anime.. and then u got brocon Shigure who has that brocon attitude changed towards her nekos...this was waaay more creepier and annoying than the VN Shigure... and to add more fuel to the fire.. it brings her brocon attitude back in a flashback sequence and this is where i knew that the writing has no idea how to make these characters presentable. <br />
<br />
Art and Animation<br />
<br />
Not gonna lie...both Art and Animation is a gigantic improvement compared to the Nekopara OVA which as also by Felix Film....Art feels more refined than the last but the consistency drops off the more episodes pass...and the animation is also undoubtedly better...movements and jumps are well choreographed and keyframe work keeps the flow from start to finish...<br />
<br />
So on a different note...to answer the question..&#039;&#039;Who is this anime for? anime only followers or VN followers?&#039;&#039;...answer is.. its for neither.. this anime tries to cater to both audiences in trying to present both old and new to the viewers and doesnt do either of them right.. <br />
<br />
Verdict(till ep 9)<br />
<br />
I wanted this anime to be good as much as any other fan of the series.. but thats not the case with this anime....it tries to do way too much things at the same time and ultimately fails on every end... characters are poorly translated over from the VN, art and animation is great eventhough inconistent at times.. and the few good things is does is overshadowed but all its issues... if you want to know why the Nekopara series is loved....try the VN or if you dont have the time or drive.. check the Nekopara OVA.. because this series is disaster that is hardly enjoyable or recommendable by either VN followers or the anime watchers<br />

    Music and art both are top notch. That&#039;s why we had our hopes high. But with every new episode it became more and more clear — Nekopara is hot garbage. <br />
<br />
Each catgirl gets one comic gag assigned in the beginning of the season, and then writers exploit it repeatedly in almost every episode. Including bringing character up just for a few seconds to show yet another version of the same joke they made in ep1. <br />
<br />
While each episode has an interesting idea — Cinnamon exploring her breeding desires or Cacao looking for new owners, every single one of them fails both to develop said characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332999">
        or move the story. In fact it doesn&#039;t move even an inch forward. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s no progression in any way. That&#039;s why you can&#039;t compare Nekopara to any decent slice-of-life where the overall story still moves: be it school year, visible career changes or something else.<br />
<br />
If this show were an isekai, it would be &quot;In Another World with My Smartphone&quot;. Just appalling in how big of a failure this is.

    A question: I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s established somewhere in the VNs that they&#039;re genetically engineered &#039;cat girls&#039;, so why call them &#039;cats&#039;?  Are there actual cats in this world aside from catgirls, or are all cats catgirls now?  Yes, I seriously thought about this hypothetical question while watching the show.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Within the Minazuki household lives six different catgirls.  When the older of the two siblings leaves to start his own patisserie business, the two youngest cats follow their master and appear in boxes as he&#039;s moving in while the other four cats and his little sister stay behind in their family home, occasionally coming by to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332962">
        take shifts at the pastry shop.  And thus (I guess) starts another chapter of their lives.<br />
<br />
Aside from the first three episodes which establish a completely new character to the Nekopara series, the anime comprises of only one-off stories that put one or two of the catgirls (who&#039;re conveniently put together in pairs) in some kind of situation that serves as the episode&#039;s focus, rarely deviating from that single story before the twenty four minutes are up before a different set takes their place in the next episode.  As a result, conflicts for the anime typically only exist within the confines of the episode, so there really isn&#039;t any overarching things to keep track of.<br />
<br />
As for the content, the show is (of course) only focused on cat-based stuff.  Rather than spending time with Kashou, the cats&#039; male master, practically everything in the series centers around how the cats interact with each other and any relationship changes that might occur as a result of the episode&#039;s conflict being resolved.  The conflicts themselves though feel very random.  One episode can be about something vastly different than another&#039;s, and I felt a little thrown off watching at times because one episode can have the girls telling stories in a blackout, and the next has two of them going through a giant, custom-built obstacle course that comes out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
Despite the surprising amount of variance the episodes have though, Nekopara just feels...boring to watch.  Even if the content is different, the general storytelling of the anime is centered solely around the girls acting like cats in every conceivable situation, and hardly anything really changes.  Because conflicts are so easily resolved, there&#039;s not a lot of actual plot to draw the attention of the viewer, especially since the cute girls are probably the biggest selling point the show has.  Without that, there&#039;s hardly anything else that can really hook the viewer, which is made especially boorish when the girls can be extremely hit or miss depending on who they are and whether or not they&#039;re the focus at the time.<br />
<br />
As a result, Nekopara&#039;s story feels less like a &#039;story&#039; and more like a collection of memories put together one after another and told through hearsay.  The episodic storytelling is by no means bad, but everything about them lacks anything significant to draw in the viewer aside from the girls doing their damndest at being cute, acting cute, and having whatever little powwow at the time to keep the episode moving.  The content feels extremely samey, and given how the Nekopara VNs pan out, a part of me wishes the story went a little beyond just having the cute catgirls do cute things.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
I want to get Kashou Minazuki out of the way first because this man barely does fucking anything.  Despite being the player character that every girl in the series supposedly fawns over, he not only gets barely any screentime, but also has no real purpose in the plot aside from being the establishing point since his confections shop is one of the key settings in the series.  Like I get it, he&#039;s a blank slate to project onto, but come on, put a little effort into making him something other than a plank of wood that occasionally does something.<br />
<br />
But of course the main stars of the series are the six catgirls: Chocola, Vanilla, Cinnamon, Maple, Azuki, and Coconut.  Based on six different breeds of cat, each of these six girls bear a different archetype which range from the Kuudere, to the dumb one, to the incredibly horny one.  Despite the show putting as much effort as it could to develop and show off each one, each of the six girls feel incredibly one-note, which serves well to make each one recognizable and add more to the &#039;cute girls doing cute things&#039; storytelling, but little else beyond that.  Each girl only has a small handful of different things or character moments that they&#039;re capable of doing, which ultimately makes them really static characters if not barely impactful beyond the initial splash.  Sure it&#039;s kind of fun to see what Azuki and Coconut are fighting over this time, but I can only see Cinnamon getting horny over something random so many times before it gets stale.<br />
<br />
Minazuki Shigure serves as the second master to the catgirls as well as Kashou&#039;s younger sister of unknown age.  (Yes, it&#039;s canon that she doesn&#039;t have a confirmed age.)  Despite having something of an established brother complex, the show really makes it seem like this is her cat harem, which in my headcanon is both amusing and terrifying.  A lot of the show features Shigure instead of her brother in coincidence with the catgirls, which really only exemplify how much she loves (and creeps on) the catgirls that live with her since that&#039;s the primary character trait that&#039;s being showed off.  It&#039;s definitely an...interesting character trait, but that&#039;s about all the show really has for her.<br />
<br />
Finally is Cacao, the an anime exclusive character who is a kitten that serves as the seventh catgirl of the family.  And she doesn&#039;t really do anything.  She&#039;s silent for a great majority of the series, making her appearances more like a puzzle for the other girls to figure out.  Which makes her a character of little consequence.  Beyond the first three episodes which establish her as a new part of the family, Cacao is mostly just...there, participating only occasionally in the series and serving as a mouthpiece for things in the Nekopara universe to get explained to since she doesn&#039;t really know anything about being a &#039;catgirl&#039; as weird as that sounds.  And aside from liking dried fish and generally wants to participate in things with the other girls, there&#039;s not much else to say about her.<br />
<br />
Aesthetics:<br />
<br />
Felix Film being responsible for animating the kickstarted Nekopara OVA that got mixed reception coming back to do a full cour adaptation is definitely not something I expected but hey, at least this time it looks pretty good, right?<br />
<br />
The art of Nekopara 2020 is one of the things I praise about the show because it&#039;s surprisingly good.  The characters look pretty good even when compared to the L2D/VN counterparts, and the consistency of the art genuinely surprised me because I did not expect this show to have actually good art.  This alongside with the light color scheme and the detailed frilliness of the girls&#039; various outfits and uniforms really had me take a step back and actually think, &quot;Wow this looks pretty good.&quot;  Admittedly seeing basically human women/girls on all fours hissing at each other like cats or curling their hands like paws to make a &#039;nyan&#039; pose definitely made me feel a little uneasy because people don&#039;t normally do that, even to be cute, but hey, it makes sense for the context of the show.<br />
<br />
And to keep up with the theming, both the OP and ED of the anime keep up the cute exterior this series has by having the seiyuus of the girls sing them with happy, bubbly instrumentals going on in the background.  &quot;Shiny Happy Days&quot; being the OP is sung by all six of the girls alternating with an upbeat, bubbly tone, whereas the ED, &quot;Hidamari no Kaori&quot;, is sung only by Chocola and Vanilla&#039;s voice actors in a slower ballad reminiscent of falling asleep since the two girls do sleep in the same bed.<br />
<br />
My one qualm with the sound however is actually the voice actors.  Compared to the kickstarted OVA, the entire cast of Nekopara 2020 is voiced by different people.  Although I don&#039;t know the reason why Nekopara got an &#039;anime adaptation&#039; after the OVA&#039;s reception, I&#039;d imagine the best way to make one would be to use the original voice cast, so I&#039;m a little confused why this isn&#039;t the case.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
Considering the source material for this show involves a series of visual novels that have a dedicated slider in the settings to adjust how much boob bounce the girls have whenever their L2D models are moving on-screen, I was not expecting this show to be serious or outstanding in the slightest, and was prepared for whatever ridiculousness was going to come my way.  I did not expect this show to be as boring as it was.  I even got tired of watching Cinnamon, my favorite of the six cats, because almost all of her scenes just ended up with her becoming horny without anything else of note.<br />
<br />
Because everything was side stories, it felt like the show was more like a slideshow that was showing off the girls rather than being any kind of faithful adaptation to the source material.  (Which I guess is what they tried to do with the OVA, and failed.)  The &#039;cute girls doing cute things&#039; subgenre of slice of life is so oversaturated with so many different shows that almost nothing about this show stood out aside from the notoriety that the name &#039;Nekopara&#039; has curried over years within the anime community.  Sure the girls were cute, yes there was a plot during each episode, and Cacao did spice things up a bit by being a completely new character with potential, but all of that is meaningless when the show is nothing but an endless cycle of &#039;cute&#039;.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m sure there&#039;re many people who enjoy this kind of mindless cuteness, but for me, it never felt like the cuteness had a purpose.  It was the default tone and mode that this series had and that alone made watching it feel like a slog then a brand of cute that had some substance behind it.  Had the show given us some more substantial story arcs aside from just doing side story after side story, then maybe things could&#039;ve been different.  But as it stands, the show is so mindless in being this cute cat creation that I find it hard pressed to define it as anything aside from that.  Admittedly it does that well, but the show has nothing else going for it.<br />
<br />
As such, my recommendation really goes out for fans of the series, especially those who&#039;re REALLY hardcore fans since this is the group that I think would get a kick out of this adaptation the most.  For the casual viewer, there&#039;s not really anything I can see is worth the time since the brand of &#039;catgirls&#039; being the show&#039;s main characters are about the only thing that gives the show any sense of unique qualities.  Without that, the anime ends up feeling like a cute girls doing cute things show, and I think we&#039;ve gotten to a point where we have more than enough of those in the world.

    Nekopara is a fun and cozy way to spend 24 minutes. Simply put, it’s a very relaxing show with extreme amounts of literal and figurative fluff.<br />
<br />
Ironically, in contrast to its hentai origins, Nekopara is one of the most wholesome shows I’ve seen. Narratively, there’s not much on the way of plot in this show. It’s very much a “monster” of the week type thing with each episode providing a new challenge or event for the girls to prepare for. These will usually be 90 percent fluff and 10 percent fan service. <br />
<br />
If you’re looking for a fun and relaxing way to deal with the current

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332883">
        uncertain times and pass time, enjoy CGDCT or cat girls, this is your show. Don’t expect anything groundbreaking or revolutionary, but you will certainly get a laid back and cozy ride.<br />
<br />
Technically, there’s not much to speak of. This isn’t a battle shonen so there’s no real need for high quality animation. The art, however is extremely well done making the show nice and bright. This adds to that cute feel of the show.  <br />
<br />
In conclusion, Nekopara despite being no masterpiece, was one of my favourite shows of the season and helped me to wind down at the end of the week after class. It was a consistent and fun ride throughout and I look forward to future content.<br />
<br />
Nekopara gets 8 Nya’s out of 10.<br />

    “It&#039;s not my responsibility to be beautiful. I&#039;m not alive for that purpose. My existence is not about how desirable you find me.” – Warsan Shire, and also nobody in Nekopara<br />
<br />
<br />
Every few years, we get an anime that is truly a masterpiece: a work that excels in every area to create something that not only entertains greatly, but explores themes so deep that they leave a lasting impression on those who watched them and on the way that anime and the world moves forward in the future. These anime are indeed rare – we are lucky to get one in a year, but by some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332907">
        miracle, we managed to get two such anime in a single season. It’s hard to imagine a better way to begin the decade than with these two series. One of these is, of course, Interspecies Reviewers, and the other is the anime that we will be talking about today: Nekopara.<br />
<br />
Many great stories focus on dystopias: from worlds that are blatantly dystopian such as Orwell’s 1984, to ones that are more morally grey, and could even be perceived by some as utopian, like Psycho-Pass. What’s so special about Nekopara is how it manages to be both of these simultaneously, giving it a lot to say about the implications of our own desires as well as the fact that we live in a society, and the direction that that society might be headed in.<br />
<br />
The first deceptively genius thing about Nekopara is its name, a combination of “neko” (the Japanese word for “cat”), and “para”, the start of the word “paradise”. Or, at least, that’s what the name seems to be, but there’s more to this series than meets the eye. There are many other words that begin with “para”: “paranoia”, “parabola”, “paraphilia”, “paradox”, etc. Which one of these words “para” represents is hotly debated amongst scholars (my money’s on “paraphilia”), but it sure as hell ain’t “paradise”… at least not for everyone involved. Sure, it may be appear to be a paradise at first glance: who wouldn’t want to be surrounded by a bunch of really cute and attractive cat girls who cater to your every need? But this perspective doesn’t consider life for said cat girls.<br />
<br />
Now, a more conventional dystopian horror would probably present the oppressed class as struggling and visibly tormented by their unjust position as slaves and sentient pets within this society, but instead we are shown something far, far more terrifying: they are totally complicit in and content with their oppression (apart from one character, who’s tail is truly the most haunting of all, but we’ll get to her later). The world of Nekopara has managed to successfully convince the cat girls that they don’t deserve basic human rights: that they are less than human, that they are better off living to serve their masters, that they must never go outside without their master unless they wear their bells. And they never once question these ideas. Nekopara isn’t just about how society oppresses us, but also how we allow it to continue to do so, and that is something truly bone-chilling.<br />
<br />
But it’s more than merely our complacency in our own oppression that’s being challenged by Nekopara, but also the fact that we may actually be idolising this sort of oppression when put upon others for our own benefit. After all, the series masquerades as a paradise for the viewer to self-insert themselves into, enjoying owning a bunch of cat girl pet slave waifu things, whose sole existence is to serve and please them. This series makes the viewer think: “Would I have been in favour of the subjugation of women and people of colour if I was born a century or two earlier? Am I in favour of the ways in which minority groups remain oppressed today?”.<br />
<br />
While cat girls serve as a useful metaphor for many oppressed minorities, such as people of colour, the LGBTQ+ community, or weeaboos, they are also of literal significance. If our society has the same view of cat girls that Nekopara does, then we may ourselves become such a society once Elon Musk has successfully created genetically engineered cat girls. In fact, how excited people are for the scientific research being conducted into the field of genetically engineered cat girls is quite concerning: what will be their fate?<br />
<br />
Our society could easily become the dystopia presented to us in Nekopara. We may look back on this anime much like how we look back on Serial Experiments Lain today: more relevant many years into the future than when it came out. Indeed, Nekopara is a truly visionary work, and the scariest part is that we won’t even realise that we’re in a dystopia – most of the population will think that this is just the natural order of things, ignorant to anything other than the status quo.<br />
<br />
“But what about the based, woke and red-pilled individuals who see the true horror of their society?” I hear you ask. “Surely they’ll be able to save everyone from this hellhole, right?”. I wish that were the case, but the most terrifying thing of all about Nekopara is the way in which it shoots this sentiment down multiple times throughout its story through the use of the character Cacao, the only character we see in the series who doesn’t see the oppression of cat girls as a good thing.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the most important thing about Cacao is how difficult it is for her to speak: this represents how society denies those who go against it of a voice: you can’t spread your ideas or influence change; you will just be silenced. But it’s not just that she can’t communicate properly: she can’t escape either. At the start of the series, she is a stray cat, this being her attempt at self-actualisation: to become something other than a lesser being who lives solely to serve her master. But she is found by Chocola and taken in by this horrifying system. Each time she tries to escape, which the other characters interpret as her merely “getting lost” (because who could possibly want a life other than to fulfil their natural role within the hierarchy?), she is found once again. The message of the series is clear: there is no escape from society. No matter what we do, we live in a society. And what could possibly be more of a depressing realisation than that?<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 10 – The genius thing about the story of Nekopara is just how naturally it integrates these oppressive structures into its world-building. Layered with metaphor and meaning in every shot and every line of dialogue, this is truly one of the most masterfully crafted stories in the history of not just anime, not just television, but in all of storytelling throughout all of time.<br />
<br />
Character: 10 – The characters of Nekopara are some of the most hauntingly realistic characters in anime. The way each of them has developed their own unique psychological coping mechanisms to delude them into being content with their unjust society is handled in a way that seems to have been brought about by the propaganda that the society has fed them. We see this process gradually happening to Cacao, one of the most tragic and sympathetic characters I’ve ever seen, as she loses her independence to become yet another slave to her “goshujin-sama”.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation: 10 – Nekopara’s visuals expertly convey the fetishization of the cat girls, which is a significant part of what leads to their dehumanization. The way it presents them as being incredibly cute both serves to help us see what the humans of the society see of them, as well as giving us increased sympathy to their plights, even as they themselves remain unaware of them.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10 – The voice acting complements the character designs of the cat girls in adding to their fetishization, while also being far enough from anything you would hear in real life that it feels like something’s… wrong here. This is an important part of leading the viewer to the conclusion that society isn’t supposed to be this way. The background music that plays mostly consists of the same track playing over and over again as it becomes increasingly grating, fitting the mood of the series perfectly. The track might seem nice at first, but it quickly becomes something that sounds far more sinister and unpleasant.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10 – I was hooked. Each week, I was so excited to watch the next episode and find out which elements of the world and character psychology would be explored next, and it’s been a long time since an anime has made me think this deeply or filled me with this much existential dread.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, Nekopara is one of the greatest pieces of cautionary fiction that has ever been conceived. It may not be for everyone, as it may cause you to slump into a two-week-long depression, and it certainly isn’t an easy watch, but if you want to experience some of the greatest political and philosophical epiphanies of your life, then Nekopara is absolutely a must watch.

    I was expecting a cute series with some ecchi, so I was pretty disappointed.<br />
<br />
The story is bland and couldn&#039;t hold my attention. All they do is do &quot;cute&quot; things that are just hella boring. I couldn&#039;t even be bothered to waste my time finishing some of the episodes. The art is just average, nothing special. The sounds and voices are cute, which may be the only redeeming quality. The characters are annoying and their little habits are just annoying as hell. <br />
<br />
There isn&#039;t any ecchi, although I really expected at least some.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, it sucks. Play the games instead.

    This is a fun, cute little anime that&#039;s enjoyable with, or without playing the VNs. Don&#039;t go into it expecting any sort of deep story since that isn&#039;t what it&#039;s going for anyway. Comedy and cuteness are its strongest offerings and it does them well. They also did well at keeping the spirit of the VNs while separating them so the anime is kind of its own little story instead of just trying to blatantly copy the source material, which doesn&#039;t always work out for titles based on VNs.<br />
<br />
In short, if you&#039;re interested in an anime that&#039;s just there to be some lighthearted fun, give

    From my profile picture and rating you&#039;re probably expecting this review to be incredibly biased... and it will be! <br />
<br />
~ STORY ~<br />
<br />
&quot;Catgirls are closer to normal cats than humans. These days catgirls fit into society as pets in families ... Our family has six including Chocola and Vanilla.&quot; - Nekopara Vol. 1<br />
<br />
This rather mundane quote from the first Nekopara game summarises the premise of this anime adaptation well. It is not an anime made to show an action filled adventure feauturing catgirls or to set up a fantasy land brimming with catgirls desirous to copulate with the main character (contrary to popular belief). <br />
<br />
In actuality,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333985">
        the anime shows an &quot;alternate timeline&quot; to the visual novels in which the characters don&#039;t end up becoming catpanions (aka lovers) with the main character. It portrays the hardships of being a catgirl including abandonment, insecurities, disagreements with other catgirls and even the struggles of overcoming a genetically ingrained &quot;cat instinct&quot; to fit in with modern human society. It&#039;s truly an anime looking into the life of one family in this catgirl world and how they&#039;re living with seven catgirls by their side.<br />
<br />
As some would say simply: catgirls being catgirls, nothing more, nothing less. <br />
<br />
~ MUSIC ~<br />
<br />
All of the music and sounds fit with the Nekopara theme very well. From the opening to the ending, nothing disappoints. Songs feautured within the anime and sung by certain catgirls are also wonderful. The only sound that bothered me was the rather unrealistic &quot;boing boing&quot; sound used during breast/ butt actions but I think at this point it&#039;s a sound affect used within most anime which wants to accentuate those assets. <br />
<br />
~ QUESTIONS ~<br />
<br />
Do I need to play the games to enjoy the anime? <br />
Most likely. You will not enjoy the anime as much if you don&#039;t. The anime doesn&#039;t walk you through each catgirls&#039; personality, who they are, their goals and aspirations as much as you&#039;ll see in the games. The anime throws you into the scenarios assuming you already know who the catgirls are and the inside jokes from the game. (Note: You can play the games on Steam without the R18 DLC and play its entirety without any NSFW scenes.)<br />
<br />
So what makes this anime really good? <br />
Nostalgia. If you played the original games and enjoyed them then I can assure you, you will enjoy this. Featuring song tracks from the games which hit you like a nostalgic truck, inside jokes from the games including Cinnamons delusions. If you missed the girls like they were your own catgirls, seeing them on screen again will bring a smile to your face. If you&#039;re not as familiar with the characters, but know them a decent amount to watch the anime, you may just grow to love them to the point you&#039;ll want to play the visual novels.<br />
<br />
~ THE BIG ISSUE ~<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve seen other reviews mention Nekopara originally stemming from it&#039;s game predecessors which were H-games and should just be considered &quot;porn&quot;, which relates to the rather low ratings given due to the lack of lewd/ NSFW content in the anime. As someone who has played the Nekopara games, I disagree with this point as in actuality there have been Nekopara games without R18 content (such as Nekopara vol. 0 and Nekopara Extra) which only explored the wholesome aspects of the catgirls&#039; lives, much like this anime does. The original games which did include R18 content (vol 1-3) still had an immense amount of content which wasn&#039;t just &quot;porn&quot; and did delve deeply into who the characters are, why they behave the way they do, their interests, childhood and interactions- making the games at times even drama filled, especially Maple&#039;s story in Vol. 3. I guess, in a way, your enjoyment in watching the anime is a way of determining if you truly payed attention to the game&#039;s plot or you were there just to enjoy the porn... being the latter may have dampened your enjoyment of the anime significantly.<br />
<br />
~ OVERALL ~<br />
<br />
As you may have assumed, I only really wrote this review to combat the negative ratings and reviews the anime has gotten thus far. It truly is a pleasure to watch if you have a certain pre-exisisting bond with the characters. If you don&#039;t, I doubt you&#039;ll enjoy this anime as much as some have or will feel in any way as passionate about it. The games, as you might be able to tell, are much more succinct in telling a story about the catgirls. This anime adaptation should very much be treated as &quot;additional content&quot; to aid the game rather than a stand-alone adaptation which can be seen without pre-existing knowledge. Either way, catgirls are awesome and so is Nekopara. <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading.<br />

    What would you do if you found out that an anime moe is an adaptation of an adult Visual Novel? The normal thing to do is to stop watching anything about the anime, because you don&#039;t expect to see this type of genre being adapted, especially through TV. However, I need to inform you that Nekopara is a preview of what the game&#039;s story would be, without the explicit scenes and with a hint of suggestive moments. Does that make anime good? NOT!! And we need to talk about it.<br />
<br />
Nekopara tells a very simple story: Kashou owns a bakery, called La Soleil. The confectionery has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review366195">
        cats as employees, divided into three pairs, where the “maid café” style predominates. Her sister, Shigure, is the one who gives housing and comfort to most of the cats who work there. The synopsis, by itself, already indicates that the anime will not be much different from the moe pattern, where the characters do anything in a cute and pleasant way. However, I see a serious problem in Nekopara. Anime doesn&#039;t like its story, let alone what the characters do or don&#039;t do. Mostly, the show ends up problematizing one or two characters, it develops an expected outcome and the cycle repeats itself constantly. Beforehand, I must remember that the anime tried to be decent. I admit, I liked its beginning. It wasn&#039;t a story that I would remember in the future, but at least I was interested in how the anime managed to &quot;hide&quot; part of Visual Novel and how it made me like the silly things. With each episode that the characters got into a problem, I had fun with how nice and nice he was being.<br />
<br />
But, not everything is flowers ... the show starts to tire with the passing of the episodes and it jumps from adorable, to repetitive and boring. This is common in moe anime, but Nekopara has evolved up a notch. An example that I could mention is “Anima Yell!”, An anime that, although it has the same moe pattern, it tries to be something more, using sport as a tool to encourage viewers. “Senko-san” is another example of a moe that worked, conveying an idea of ​​Senko being an always pleasant caring character. Both animes tried and managed to do very well. Nekopara stopped trying and did not stop being tiring from the second half. The funny adventures of Cacao getting lost in the city streets supported the anime, in my opinion. When that stopped happening, I believe that the script did not know how to continue positively. It was a more boring moment than another. They still had legal elements, but the essence was left out.<br />
<br />
If only that were the negative side of the show, I would still like the anime, but my biggest problem is with a specific character and what she represents in the anime: Cinnamon. For those who have already forgotten, Cinnamon is the cat with blue hair, being Maple&#039;s double, in the confectionery. She has the closest proximity to the adult theme of the game. During the show, Cinnamon has moments when she is constantly used as a sexual stereotype of pleasure and perversion. And that happens in practically every episode, where some random moment generates excitement in the character. That factor was enough to bother me a lot, because the character only existed to remind the audience of the fact that the anime comes from an adult game.<br />
<br />
The problem is further intensified when we realize that Cinnamon did not stand out for itself, which happened with all the other characters. Vanilla and Chocola are the main group of characters, Cacao is the protagonist of the beginning of the show, Azuki and Coconut solve their problems as sisters and Maple has a desire to become a singer. All of them feature episodes entirely dedicated to them, but Cinnamon has NO HIGHLIGHTS. I wouldn&#039;t mind that if the anime were to develop it in a different way, but since everything that reminds me of it is related to her excitement, I can&#039;t take the character seriously.<br />
<br />
Finally, Nekopara is an anime that tried to be something and ended up being absolutely nothing. I admire the attempt by the Felix Film Studio to put on such a delicate show (in the sense of adapting such a controversial game), but you can&#039;t deny your problems. Furthermore, the production did not help to please the public, precisely because of the factors mentioned above. Overall, it was an interesting experience.

    I did not enjoy this anime because i am not a fan of nekos, i find them too much &quot;nya nya&quot; <br />
the story is decent but not formidable<br />
i was not disapointed because i know i am biased by the fact they are nekos<br />
i think the anime can be better by the story and by the characters, letting the characters less &quot;nya nya&quot;, less &quot;cute&quot; <br />
As a conclusion, i will say that this anime is not woth a try if you do not like nekos because they are cliché. But, the graphics and the sound are very good, good environnements, and there is no sex in

    Welcome to La Soleil! The café with a lot of cute catgirls, a true cat paradise!<br />
Hi!I&#039;m pretty sure you came here for a &quot;Oh, the animation was...&quot;, &quot;Oh, the characters are...&quot; type of review.But nope!I&#039;m sorry to break it to you.Instead, I&#039;ll be telling you a short story on why I love this franchise so much and how it helped me feel better during some dark times.If you want my opinion on the animation/plot/sound etc., go to the bottom bellow the hearts!<br />
<br />
Okay,when it comes to Nekopara, I have seen two kinds of opinions on twitter:<br />
1.) It&#039;s super cute!Adorable! I love it!<br />
2.)This is such a joke,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333126">
        people are only in for it because of the NSFW game!<br />
<br />
I first played the game back two years ago as a horny teenager.First walkthrough, skipped all the dialogue so I could get to the steamy parts.Honestly, didn&#039;t think much of it back then.But, about a year later, I started playing for the sake of the story because I was in a very,very dark place back then.The stress I had at school, family problems, there was a lot and I was at one of the worst points in my life.I was desperate and binged a lot of different shows that included dark themes, making me feel even more depressed.One day I stumbled uppon nekopara once again on steam.The REALLY cute design catched my eye once more, and so I installed the game again and began reading.A few weeks later, I felt like a different person.I wasn&#039;t feeling as sad anymore because I knew I had cute catgirls waiting for me at home, no matter how bad my classmates treated me or how much my family yelled at me.I knew that once everyone was asleep,I&#039;ll be owning a café with catgirls that love me more than anything.<br />
And, after new years, when I saw the anime started airing, I started crying.Finally!And I watched it.Now, it finnished airing.This anime made me cry not because of the story, but the memories it awoke in me.No, you probably won&#039;t be loving it this much.Yes, its okay to judge and call it cringe.But, please let us people who loved this enjoy it! Thank you for your time ♡<br />
<br />
♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
-As far as the story goes, it&#039;s quite cutesy, girly and includes a lot of slice of life elements.The world with humanoid catgirls is truly fascinating and has a lot of detail to it.And the events that follow from first to last minute, are all very relaxing, funny and adorable!Moist!<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
I can not stress this enough!The fashion in this show is just GOALS.I wish I had a closet with such items, truly!Besides that, everything looks quite smooth and crisp.So soft, you wish you could poke Chocolas cheeks!And fluff Cinnamons hair!<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
The opening is quite upbeat and happy, reminds me of candy pop or kawaii edm.A nice song to start the day with!The ending is more relaxing and I&#039;d say it&#039;s good to listen to at night, before sleep.I didn&#039;t pay much attention to the ost tho.<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
Even tho sometimes cringey, all the catgirls remind me of little kids.I love the idea of the cats being named after cake/icecream flavors A LOT! I even named my own 3 cats Chocola, Vanilla and Maple!Even tho they&#039;re not with us anymore.RIP to my favorite cats &lt;3<br />
Anyway, Each character seems quite different from the other, each has their own opinions and tastes and I&#039;d say there is something for every viewer to find and love!You will definitely find a catgirl you like!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
I&#039;d say this is a show to watch when you&#039;re a bit stressed maybe, when you wanna relax and see something overly girly and cute, and a show you could watch with your little cousins!I did at least~<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
I can&#039;t thank the producers enough for turning this game into an anime.I enjoyed every second of it, despite the lower scores in previous categories.I hope you enjoy your stay at La Soleil, the catgirls are waiting for you!! ♡

    [This is a no spoiler review]<br />
I&#039;ll just be using the standard 5 part review to look over everything.<br />
<br />
Story - 3<br />
The plot follows the lives of 7 cats Chocola, Vanilla, Coconut, Cinnamon, Maple, Azuki, Cacao and two humans, Kashou and Shigure. For a Slice Of Life anime like this, there usually needs to be some comedy to make it enjoyable for the viewer. They definitely put some in there. Most of the comedy is based off of the personalities of the cats and how they act towards each other or about something. I think that a Slice Of Life anime should be relatable, like you can

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333031">
        understand the character&#039;s lives and feel almost apart of it. The anime did go through the lives of all the cats and it wasn&#039;t always on Chocola and Vanilla. The anime didn&#039;t have impactful episodes that I can remember, cause I forgot what happened in a good chunk of the anime. Like things don&#039;t carry over to the next episode, it&#039;s like one of those cartoons, where something happens in one episode, new thing in the next, and so on for the whole 12 episodes. Really the only things that carried on were Cacao making a friend, and... oh wait, I can&#039;t remember anything.<br />
<br />
Art - 7<br />
The art is good, not much to say here.<br />
<br />
Sound - 8<br />
I really like the opening and ending of this anime and the sound during the anime is also really fun and cheerful.<br />
<br />
Characters - 7<br />
For the characters, I thought the anime does a good job in developing their personalities through their actions, how they act, and also through flashbacks. The characters themselves are well, general I guess. The characters aren&#039;t so interesting, and they&#039;re rather simple.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 6<br />
Despite how bad the story was, I did enjoy it a little, maybe also because of how bad this season was tho. <br />
<br />
Overall - 6.2 - Rounded down to 5, read below.<br />
Tbh, this score would probably be lower, like closer to a 5, the only thing raising the score is the art and sound because tbh, the art and sound was good and the characters were actually well developed. However in this case, I feel like the art and sound don&#039;t matter cause this is just a waste of time. Because of that I&#039;m rounding this down to a 5.

    12 episodes of basically softcore cat girl porn. Knowing this is a hentai game and everything to be expected but I was left with more questions than answers on the whole thing on how their society runs. That and I never expected to see a cat girl get on all fours and run into a bush. That made my night. Catgirls are cute and all but in reality cats are assholes. I should know I have had like 25 of them thanks to taking in pregnant strays. One of these days catgirls are gonna be real and Reddit is gonna be full of people complaining

    So it&#039;s over. A very disappointing adaptation.<br />
<br />
But Why? Why is this?<br />
<br />
How could Felix Firm ruin such an easy adaptation?<br />
<br />
Because the OP and ED were great, the character designs are mostly faithful, and the animation was great. However...<br />
<br />
1) They skipped 90% of the introduction, a.k.a. why catgirls exist, how they are adopted etc. This also includes how Chocola and Vanilla were adopted. If you read the vn then you knew that was a very heartbreaking scene, but the anime only viewers will never know about this.<br />
<br />
2) The main fucking character is barely relevant. Somehow Felix Firm managed to change nekopara from a harem to a yuri

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333333">
        show!<br />
<br />
3) Pacing was dreadful. Random anime original Keijo episode that should have been used to develop the cat girls. Cacao is not even in the vn - she is an anime only catgirl. She starts with no personality and ends with no personality, and she is a chore to watch due to this. Most of the cat girls are reduced to mere stereotypes - a problem due to mostly the points above.<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t complain about the &#039;spicy&#039; stuff not put into this adaptation. But regardless I am still very disappointed with the adaptation. I guess it is a mediocre slice of life show? I don&#039;t even know as this show has no sense of direction or plot! And it makes me so frustrated! Regardless there are some enjoyable scenes and I love the vn, and that is why I did not drop this show.<br />
<br />
Alas, if I am being very generous then this show will get a 4. But if I put myself into a anime original viewer&#039;s shows, then a 3 would be more accurate. *sigh*<br />
<br />
oh well... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ <br />
<br />
rant over

    Nekopara as we know it, is well...an hentai game series where we can PLAY AROUND with cats. Cats? No, CATGIRLS. How much fun, don´t you agree? But has this anime lived up at its expectation?<br />
<br />
<br />
When this was first announced, i was excited that i immediatly scored 10 before it aired because i love the series overall. But little did i know i would be very wrong. Before you start shooting rockets at me because i stand my 10 on this, hear me out.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Its a 6 in reality. This series follows the main games story, if you can call it a story; but it didn´t felt

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333055">
        equal or better than the games, rather much worse.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story-6; Like i said, not much story here. Come on, its a +18 game, what kind of story do you expect here? All they do is just do anything different every episode as its own way. While i like the ideas they have, they are just not executed that welll.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Art-7; Art is questionable at times. First episodes(3 to be exact) were terrible in terms of art; Chocola and Vanilla at times looked awful, specially the scene where they clap to Azuki(if i remember correctly). Coco and Azuki fighting on underwear also didn´t looked very well(ep.4) at all and yet they repeated that scene on the last episode of the series. More critism on coco because she looked awful; in last ep she well, looked odd at some frames. Overall, it is decent given the episodes 5-11 didn´t had any problem that i spot on. Heck, the OVA art is much better, thats a 9/10.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound-9; No judging here, sound is very good, thats what felt best in the series.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Character-5; This is the main point of dissapointment, the characters. I gotta say i was very dissapointed on how they behave. This series is supposed to follow the main games yet...why don´t they behave the same?<br />
<br />
<br />
Vanilla is the perfect one, the rest have too many problems. Chocola is WAY TOO clumsy; in the games im sure she wasn´t like that. She was clumsy but not in every scene where as in this anime, she is clumsy all the time in 4 EPISODES. 4! Do they hate her or something?<br />
<br />
<br />
Maple just doesn´t exist. She is just relevant in ep.9, the rest she does nothing which is sad because is one of the cats that stand out the most imo. <br />
<br />
<br />
Cinnamon is just...her being lewd. Thats it. That´s all what she does. I mean the games she was the same but not all the time; again, same problem as Chocola. But this time, they take it to extreme; every episode has a scene of her being lewd like they didn´t had any jokes or topics to bring. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Coco is a mix of Chocola and Maple. Clumsy and Irrelevant. She also does nothing but being in a fight with Azuki or messing things around. She and Azuki were only revelant in ep 6 and thats it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Azuki, again doesn´t exist and she is supposed to be the influence of the bunch. Dissapointing too.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shigure...no. What happened to her love for Kashou? Thats the only complaint i have AND THATS WHAT SHE IS! This is a completely diffrent Shigure that i know of and only gets an episode to be relevant at which btw, was not her best. And Kashou? ...Who´s Kashou?<br />
<br />
<br />
Cacao who was supposed to be the main focus or should have been, is only relevant in the last couple of episodes(10-12). Expected much more from her; her cuteness is good but it doesn´t change the fact that she needed more focus. And no i won´t talk about Chiyo, she is just there.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-7; It felt decent. While of the many flaws, the anime is supposed to be relaxing(in a way...)and fun and thats what it was at times. For people who never played the series, it must be very good for them but for someone who has knowledge, it only makes us think on how much they could have improved...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall-6; For a Nekopara fan, this felt dissapointing. I thought it would be much better but instead we got a downgrade from the games. Not having the same voice actors was a bit of an issue aswell as the experience didn´t felt the same. If you are a Nekopara fan, you should consider before watching as it will be a bit of dissapointment for you. If you aren´t, enjoy nekos being clumsy and cute. Much cute.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why did i rated 10? I love the series and i know Nekoworks can do much better than this, i belive in them. This was only a step and lets hope Vol.4 has the potential that they can demonstrate.

    Neko Paradise!<br />
<br />
Nekopara finally got a full length anime and what with the OVA being a small taste as to what the anime series was gonna be, Nekopara &#039;s anime series in itself is a decent slice of life comedy anime with a *ahem* few changes from the game to make it fit into the slice of life comedy anime. Nonetheless Nekopara has neko-moeness ALL ROUND.<br />
<br />
Nekopara&#039;s anime series follows Chocola voiced by Yuki Yagi and Vanilla voiced by Saeki Iori in their daily lives in La Soleil, a patisserie owned by Kashou Minazaki. Now slightly diverging from the game which starts as soon as the first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332945">
        episode is that Chocola finds a stray young cat that latche sonto Chocola, unable to know what to do, Chocola secretly tries to hide this stray cat, but as this stray cat...let&#039;s call her Cacao, well Cacao pretty much becomes  aprt of the cast and we gets some development to her, with her opening her up to the rest of the cast as well as her joining in the rest of the core cast in their antics, mostly as a cheerleader for Chocola. <br />
<br />
Nekopara is a slice of life comedy to the T and LA is fine with that as the antics the core cats goes through is fairly good comedy especially with the character interactions of the cast at that. The slice of life aspect focuses on the cats as well as Cacao for the most part, the comedy revolves around the character interactions, all mostly moe and like LA said at the start of this review, this is pretty much Neko paradise bliss as far as LA is aware.<br />
<br />
Now since Nekopara is a character slice of life comedy centric anime, let&#039;s talk about the characters. Starting off, Kashou Minazuki is such a nothing character, being the owner of Vanilla and Chocola, but he&#039;s mostly in the background to make way with Shigure Minazuki, his little sister and the rest of the cats as the center focus. Oddly enough Chocola and Vanilla are mostly the narrative focus characters instead of the &quot;player character&quot; of Kashou in this anime&#039;s case. Vanilla is the stoic teaser and minder to the genki ditzy Chocola. Before Cacao opens up, Chocola mostly minds Cacao, but afterwards, Chocola is at the most her usual self anyways. Coconut voiced by Marin Mizutani is the clumsy but doesn&#039;t know her own strength and often butt heads the the tsundere Azuki voiced by Shiori Izawa. We also have Cinnamon voiced by Yuri Noguchi a ditzy but ecchi daydreamer whenever a sexual innuendo comes into play and Maple voiced by Miku Ito who&#039;s the most grounded of the cast and minds the rest of the cats. Lastly the aforementioned Shigure, Kashou&#039;s little sister and mostly keeps the cats in check though her absolutely loving cats is kinda running gag to her.<br />
<br />
The Neko&#039;s themselves do get screentime as well as their own (or coupled together) character development in one episode thus making us want to know them better, of course Chocola, Vanilla and Cacao gets majority of the screentime because of the Cacao plot point but the rest of core cast gets their own, like Coconut and Azuki having an all day competition with one another, Maple&#039;s singing career, Shigure&#039;s depressing day and finally digging into Cinnamon&#039;s ditzy fantasizing head. Minimum cast and all utilized which is all good.<br />
<br />
The animation done by Felix Film was actually done pretty well, from the moe yet polished character designs and it&#039;s decent backgrounding. Felix Films if anything did itself quite well for a &quot;slice of life comedy&quot; especially when it&#039;s to it&#039;s character designs and considering it&#039;s a character slice of life comedy, Felix Film knew where to pull in the effort to the animation in. All in all Felix Films did great in terms of character designs. <br />
<br />
The voice cast does have a few changes form the game, but nonetheless there were some good voice actors to point out, like Yuki Yagi as the genki Chocola, the stoic one liner of Saeki Iroi as Vanilla to the ditzy ecchi daydreamer of Cinnamon and Shiori Izawa as the tsundere Azuki and finally M.A.O as the competent but lovingly funny Shigure Minazuki, the weirdest thing is of Cacao&#039;s vice actor as her voice actor Yuuka Morishima doesn&#039;t really do much as Cacao besides some grunting and noises as Cacao, yes as Cacao opens up so does the amount of lines Yuuka gets but semantics. Nonetheless the voice cast were pretty great especially from Yuki Yagi as Chocola.<br />
<br />
But yes, as much as Nekopara is infamous for it&#039;s rather...*ahem*  explicit adult material of it&#039;s visual novel, the anime adaptation is a bleached underpants anime adaptation of the visual novel and given us a more slice of life comedy of Nekopara&#039;s source material and what with Cacao brought into the anime adaptation is somewhat proof of that and LA doesn&#039;t mind as LA REALLY didn&#039;t mind Nekopara&#039;s comedic slice of life hijinks one bit and more or less gave this anime series as a VERY GOOD breather anime in comparison to the animes in Winter 2020 (and no LA doesn&#039;t mean this in a bad way either). If Nekopara achieved anything, it&#039;s essentially the calming cat videos in Youtube bundled into anime form with all it&#039;s slice of life comedy elements to it and of course with what character developments given to the Neko&#039;s were also good as well.<br />
<br />
Coconuts is best Neko, don&#039;t at me!<br />

    No actual story development but was fun to watch for gags and loads of fun. Wish there was more character development overall but I enjoyed the show. Wish they also gave more screen time to the la patisserie dude cuz I thought he was the main character (which he is) but gets less screen time later on. Overall I wouldn’t put this in the romance but in the slide of life and comedy section. It’s a great distraction from the real world and the music absolutely slaps. Hoping for a second season or an ova. I didn’t kno they were from a game but I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369701">
        would rather watch this than play the game. A pure anime for all the innocent minded people but can have a few dirty jokes here and there from cinnamon. Recommended for pg14+
