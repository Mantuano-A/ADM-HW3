Anyhow, Seikon no Qwaser is... a unique concept. I first did not want to watch it due to the overwhelming amount of boobs. Really. Then I heard that it had a second season. I gave it a second try and found it amusing.<br />

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37800">
        whatevertheirnamesare. Turns out they&#039;re special. And now Sasha has to protect em by sucking girls&#039; breast milk, or &#039;Soma&#039; to empower his control of iron. Other Qwasers, like him, control a metal element (and I whip up my periodic table), well whatever, you&#039;ll just understand if you are good in chemistry. An example would be Katja-sama and her wonderful copper. There&#039;s a catch though. They all want that relic as well.<br />
The story is normal. And what do I mean by normal? I mean that there is a main character and his mascots searching for something, and bad guys want it too. That&#039;s all there is to it, really. Just prepare yourselves for some plot twists and awesome wtf moments where Sasha just beats the shit out of stuff after sucking on breasts. Isn&#039;t it just normal?<br />
<br />
The characters of this anime are your unoriginal harem characters. Tsundere Mafuyu, airhead Tomo, quietly obedient Teresa. And then comes Sasha (Alexander). How cute, a tsundere shotacon. Not much creativity in the character department, and as always, the female tsundere will have feelings for the male protagonist. Other characters make the show more fun to it. Who could ignore lovely Miyuri? And you should definitely bow down to Katja if you like  BDSM. I&#039;ll shut up now. Did I mention that Sasha has a horrible past? Hence his name Sasha the Martyr. Maybe.<br />
It&#039;s nice to see Sasha&#039;s development throughout the anime. I mean, he turns /nice/. And Mafuyu? A bit more honest than before. Otherwise, there is nothing else to include. Maybe the fact that Tomo can cook a bit at the end of the anime.<br />
<br />
The background music was boring. I could remember the only 5 tracks it has (I&#039;m guessing here). Once you hear one, you can tell what&#039;s going to come next. There&#039;s one for breastfeeding time, two battle themes, bah. It&#039;s fitting but not good enough.<br />
Voice acting is good. If you watch it, you can tell. Problem is the Russian they put in and the way Mafuyu pronounces Alexander. Damn she makes it sound painful. I was glad when she started calling him Sasha. Another flaw with VA however, is the moaning noises. Please, make it stooooop. Does sucking breasts really create such ecstasy that you cannot keep your mouth shut? Well maybe it&#039;s different when the Qwasers do it. I wouldn&#039;t know.<br />
OP and ED were fitting. Had a slight, how do you call it, &#039;church&#039; feel to it. The first ending was so eargasmic. All those lovely voice actresses singing one song. /applause. Nothing special after the first ED. Beats the rest.<br />
<br />
Art? What art? These things are just women with large blobs attached to their chest. I&#039;m referring to the majority of the characters, of course. <br />
Okay, fine, the art is good. Only parts when you can wince is when there are naked breasts. An overload of them. When I see Tomo, it&#039;s like a walking pair of fleshy blobs. And then I see nothing else.<br />
Huh? Of course I watched the uncensored version. I didn&#039;t understand it when it was censored. So watch the uncensored one; makes more sense.<br />
<br />
Pfuuuu, enjoyment. I enjoyed this anime. This actually made me feel like chemistry lessons were useful. I also liked the characters, especially Sasha and that tomboy with titanium powers.<br />
<br />
Final verdict? Watch it if you want to. 24 episodes of boobs is a lot, and I watched them in 3 days. or something. <br />
Short version:<br />
Art was good, story was okay, sound was bleh, except for voice acting, character was bleh. Overall: GOOD.<br />
<br />
Off to watch the second season.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tremble!&quot;

    Hey this is my first review.I&#039;ll try to be forthcoming as humanly possible with this show.Thirdly this review is premature with only 2 episodes in which have aired.<br />
<br />
Story- Essentially we have a silver haired character named Alexander who needs a certain form of sustenance in order to gain the energy needed for his metaphysical unravelling of the iron atom.Now what would that be, wait for it breast milk....Well isn&#039;t that the most enthralling and original concept to have surfaced in an anime.There is the local grocery store in which you can buy milk....or you can suck on a taciturn girl with gargantuan tits.Now to move

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22628">
        on. Alexander can morph iron at a mollecular level but he needs the milk. He finds himself at an Eastern Orthodox School on the fringes of being in conflict with a secret society.. This has been done before even though there might be an accumulative amount of symbolism(hence the scar).Where is Robert Langdon when you need him......?<br />
<br />
Art-Not exactly captivating or filled with guile. Even though the outlines around the girls and the luminous colours do accentuate a darker background.We also have the shounen art doctrine....chunky blocks that are suppose to suffice as hair.<br />
<br />
Sound-The song is placating to an extent in trying to precipitate a contrite vibe in making you feel sorry for the characters past.For the most part the sound acclimates to its surroundings. With a dosage of fighting music and jaded features of techno alongside it.<br />
<br />
Character-You have an arcane male lead who has a horrendous past in Alexander. The first female lead is the typical bombastic and  or wind bag namely Oribe and then of course the reticent cohort Yamanobe who&#039;s been anointed as Alexanders personal dairy farm.Last but not least we have the dull minor villians and the minor characters who might play dress up at a gothic convention. Not everyone in Eastern Europe dresses like a surceased vitamin D drained goth.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-Nonplussed for the most part. There&#039;s nothing to be ebullient or happy about in watching this.<br />
<br />
Overall- Devoid of intellect, stifling the romanticism of Eastern europe with its gaudy fashion and vacuous concepts and characters.<br />
<br />

    I couldn’t enjoy the flow of the show, because it was so thoroughly distracting. The show couldn’t make you keep a straight face, because every time you were serious for a battle, you just had to see some twit suckling a nipple. Everything that the producers and writers and developers of the last 30 years have tried to hide, was totally shit on. All the stupid coincidences of leaves blocking certain areas or objects closer to the screen that block a body – even the steam aspect of those ecchi genres made them what they were: ecchi! Quite honestly, that’s the way it was supposed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30949">
        to stay. If you wanted anything more, you could’ve gone to watch some porn somewhere! But this anime was completely outrageous. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story was unique, but so poorly played out and depicted, that it brings it all down to mediocre. The unique part being breast milk as a catalyst for power. True, not every show should follow in the EXACT footsteps of the last, but they could have at least stuck to the traditional way of dealing with ecchi shows. I AM a guy, but that doesn’t mean I was looking for porn when watching anime. The whole loli goth thing was attractive enough of an idea, but it was misconstrued with the clash of so many unneeded characters. The whole story can all be summed up in two words: FAN SERVICE.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art was good. It is by no means a great animated show, but it isn’t horrible. It’s essentially average animation for an anime. Everything was well enough depicted, and the nudity was ON PAR with most hentai. Anime should rarely be on par with hentai, which is why this is such a huge issue. There are more nipple shots in this show then there are black men in Lisa Lampanelli at any given moment. <br />
<br />
Sounds:<br />
Now admittedly, the soundtrack wasn’t bad. The opening wasn’t bad. The ending was ok. That’s about all there was. The rest of the soundtrack was forgettable. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
This was probably the worst category of them all. You cant get passed the characters self reflections who ask themselves moral questions, only to realize that it didn’t really matter, because it goes right back to the norm (nipple sucking) the next episode. More than that, the dumb bimbo with huge tits isnt even needed, because there is really no point to having her. True, she does play a big role at the end, but the point is that she didn’t HAVE to be dumb as shit. She could’ve been a regular girl. Even a smart girl. And it wouldn’t have mattered. And that’s what urks me. I think that every character should be placed and have a personality/attitude that’s relevant to the entire story. IF the story has a character who could easily be the exact opposite (personality/looks wise) and the story would still work perfectly, then it’s a wasted character, and its value/existence in the show is useless. Another character that pisses me off is the main character himself: Alexander (or Sasha for short for some reason…).  Though the majority of his pictures make him look like a hard badass, how he’s played throughout the show is disgusting. <br />
The spoiler runs till the next topic, btw.<br />
<br />
*SPOILER*<br />
I know I shouldn’t add a spoiler, but the one part that almost made me drop the series was when he lost his memory and thought he was a girl. I’m not bothered by a cross dressing anime character, but Sasha, being the badass that he is supposed to be, started to turn into a cross dressing feminine b*tch who  just made me want to leave the series alone and never even look at the name of the show again.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I couldn’t enjoy it. There were so many babes with huge boobs that I couldn’t really pay attention to the story. The only possible enjoyment I got from watching this was the fan service. And that’s what the entire story is. Fan service. Nothing more, nothing less. Actually, a little more. I don’t consider nipple sucking fan service, I consider it hentai. So yeah. <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Overall, the story could’ve been a lot better. It should’ve played out in a more conservative manner, and it would’ve been better received, and probably could’ve been better sponsored for a second season. But, because of the flashy nature of the show, it was a load of dog shit. The story eventually lost out to the fan service, and by the end, you weren’t looking forward to the next mystery. You were looking forward to the next fight, and by that, I mean you were looking forward to the next time you saw someone suck a boob.<br />

    My review is based on what i grabbed watching 3/4 of episode 1. I couldn&#039;t bear continuing nor finishing episode 1.<br />
<br />
To start of, i watched this series knowing what to expect. I&#039;m just curios and disbelieved with the plot summary and wanted to know just how much of it is true, and how bad can an anime be.<br />
<br />
Coming back to this anime, i graded this anime as 1/10 because it is that bad. For those looking for non-ecchi anime, this is NOT for you.For those looking for ecchi anime this is also NOT for you.  So who is the intended audience then?<br />
<br />
1. People who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22749">
        wants to know how bad it is.<br />
2. People wanted to see girls stripped of their dignity and getting  molested by a gray-haired young man who finds nothing wrong doing it because it gives him power.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve never been a fan of ecchi anime, but at least i watched enough random 1-2 episodes or to-love-ru and other ecchi animes to be able to know what they are. This is totally different, this anime is more like hentai, it put female dignity to other nothingness and let a gray-haired man (signifies old man?) sucks their oversized boobs on national television. Even porn or hentai puts female of higher standards, they still see her as a female. This anime doesn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
Being a 2010 anime, this anime is decently well animated with less than decent sound.  So why 4 and 6 for those category? The art is decent at best, but nothing stands out, nothing original. Ironically, what pulls down the art in this anime, are the tits of the girls of this series. To me, F-sized cup girls is more disgusting than beautiful. Too much of anything is never good. For the sound department, the only reason of why i gave it a 6 is , 5 because of the casts of the seiyuus and 1 for the script/music. I do not get how on earth, they get this seiyuus to dub this anime. Its like asking heath ledger to play 40 years old virgin.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment, as mentioned above, I&#039;m more disgusted than not watching this so enjoyment is 1/10 without a doubt. I&#039;ve watched mars of destruction and i know how bad it is. This anime, its just as bad or worst. The plot is horrendous but the idea of looking at girls pried being put down to the level that is of a cow just doesn&#039;t feel like for a man in the right mind like me. You know those commercials that drinking milk is good for your health, its like watching those but instead of drinking the milk from proper packages, you suck it directly from the cow.<br />
<br />
This series is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad, unless its intentional like mars of destruction is, the director has got to be an idiot. My only hope for this anime is that it doesn&#039;t destroy hirano aya&#039;s carrier. I really liked her but if her carrier is ruined because of this i&#039;ll be pissed as hell.

    I can assure you this. You will see boobs, boobs being sucked, boobs in varies of sizes. I have never seen this much of boobies in a Series that&#039;s actually Good!<br />
YES! It&#039;s a good Anime Series!<br />
<br />
When I first heard of this series, I thought: &quot;What weirdo would wanna watch guys sucking women breasts to gain their superpowers!?&quot;<br />
And yea, I&#039;m one of those weridos.<br />
<br />
Either you like Ecchi, or you don&#039;t. So either you will enjoy this series, or get totally turned off by how absurd it can be at times, that you will not watch it.<br />
<br />
Either way, I&#039;ll do my best to describe this series in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34460">
        my Review for you who are interested. Check the Overall (Summary) at the bottom if you wish a faster review.<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
The story is actually good! It&#039;s not the first you would think is good when how people gain their powers to fight in this series, is to suck women breasts for their so called &quot;Soma&quot;.<br />
<br />
So yea. It&#039;s about Qwasers. A human race whom can gain supernatural powers. Controlling Elements such as Iron, Fire, Space, Oxygen, Wind, all Elements can be controlled, and each Qwaser can controll One Element and each one have different abilities with their Element. To gain these powers, they suck women breasts for their Life Energy called Soma. Without it, they are weak and cannot control their element.<br />
It&#039;s easy to spoil stuff in this series, since small parts play part in something bigger. So I will only explain what&#039;s it about.<br />
<br />
We follow mainly 2 girls and 1 specific Qwaser.<br />
Tomo Yamanobe, Mafuyu Oribe and the Qwaser Aleksander Nikolaevich &quot;Sasha&quot; Hell. They are both Bad and Good Qwasers, resulting in huge battles and conflicts.<br />
A lot of conflicts between the Qwasers, Evil Qwasers are Dominate, want more power and control. And these girls are in the middle of it. Small parts off a bigger event is revealed through the episodes, the more you watch, the more you will want to continue. It never gets boring. The only thing you can predict in this Series that you will see boobs. Which I think, can never go wrong.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
<br />
It&#039;s beautifully animated. Not a to Originally Look though, but this never goes wrong. Smooth, good variations, I like this style since it&#039;s a more realistic look. Example, Eyes in manga are supposed to be big. Yes, these are big. But I dislike Huge ones like in Clannad or Kanon.<br />
Boobs looks nice as well. You could think I am &quot;overtalking&quot; the boobs section. But it&#039;s one of the main things in this series and you will see naked boobs in EVERY Episode. No kidding. Still A very watchable Great Series. I Promise you that.<br />
Only thing that bothers me, which is the same with all Series. Huge Boobies. They are girls with Natural looking boobies here, but the ones with the huge boobs are just unnatural and I have never liked it. Big boobs is one thing. Huge boobs is another. Cup size is off the charts. Though, this is a personal opinion. If you like it. Then you will love this series.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
Opening Theme 1 and Ending Theme 1 is pretty much forgettable. It&#039;s nicely made, but it&#039;s not anything you will remember. Though the Second opening after half the series, was much better. First one was more Mainstream. you&#039;ve heard the kind before.<br />
Second Opening was more twisted, and repetitive in a good way. Reflecting parts of the Series well, twisted perverted Scenes and repetitive scenes of naked boobs.<br />
Voice Acting was as I always, great by Japanese voice actors.<br />
Music during storyline was good as well. But I hardly remember anyone. Still, it satisfy you entirely and is good. Rated 8 is not an overrate. Nothing was wrong with the sound.<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
You could say you have seen similar main characters. One Totally clueless girl, best friend with a dominate but understanding girl that wants to protect everything dear to her. Then comes a 13 year old guy who doesn&#039;t give a shit about others, but sooner revealed. He has a heart like everyone else, which was left behind for his own reasons.<br />
<br />
The Characters are good. Nothing seems off placed. Due to the great story of this Anime Series.(At the same time the absurdity) They are all still very enjoyable as new characters. Including the supportive characters. <br />
<br />
I give it an 8 (very good) even though I can find similarities in some characters from other series. But it&#039;s nothing bad, since these kind of characters is always enjoyable and often used. It was very enjoyable and will say they are all unique.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
<br />
I enjoyed this series a lot! Even if you like Ecchi or not, it&#039;s not impossible for anyone to enjoy this. It has it all. It got both good and bad guys and girls. It has boobs, perverted scenes and I&#039;m not jokin on that part. <br />
<br />
Well thought through supernatural powers with a good balance. Different Elements and Levels they have reached. You can understand somewhat how powerful they are when explained.<br />
It&#039;s sometimes funny, they have put in comedy which I enjoyed a lot. More comedy could easily be fitted in.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
<br />
Given genres Action, Ecchi, Shounen, Super Power, Supernatural.<br />
A small tag of Comedy as well. If you find Ecchi funny or just like Ecchi, you will love this and is a must see.<br />
<br />
This Series was very unique, full of enjoyment and excitement. If you DONT like Ecchi, naked boobs and perverted scenes. You will probably not enjoy this since you would be disgusted every episode.<br />
The ecchi in this series is very original. It&#039;s a very serious story and sucking boobs is not an enjoyment here, it&#039;s to gain powers to fight! Which makes it sometimes so absurd since it&#039;s nothing normal about it.<br />
You will see the enjoyment while they suck on boobs. But not because of the boobs itself. Because of the powers they get from the Soma.<br />
<br />
The Story is great! Very original and enjoyable even though its so absurd in thought. But It&#039;s a good story and I love that someone has dare to come out with something like this.<br />
It&#039;s not totally unrealistic. I love the display of dirty acts by the bad guys when they have a girl as hostage for example. Starting touching and squeezing boobs to tease and anger the enemy is naturally for a maniac. And its wonderfully displayed.<br />
<br />
A true Shounen Series. Ofc, girls could like this as well. And I am longing for the Second Season.

    After 5 days I finally did it. I finished the worst show I have ever seen in my life… but that was to be expected since I watched it for the sole purpose of proving my nerves of steel. Before watching this I didn’t know what a show had to put me through, so I am forced to give it the lowest score possible and to be honest I didn’t think this show would cut it. So what happened?<br />
Let’s get down to business, shall we? <br />
<br />
(note: This might contain minor spoilers)<br />
________________________________________<br />
To summarize it vaguely: This anime follows a generic shounen plotline, filled with borderline pornographic

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200094">
        scenes, which take up a big part of the screen time. For the interested, these scenes consist of powerful human creatures, regardless of gender, literally sucking a magical energy-drink-like fluid, called “soma”, out of a female virgin’s breast. These creatures, called Quasars, possess the ability to control a certain type of atoms to a molecular level, unique to each individual quasar, but without having consumed quality “soma”, they can’t use their powers and thus are as useless as the rest of the normal humans in this show.<br />
Let’s start with the characters:<br />
________________________________________<br />
Hell, Alexander Nikolaevich (“Sasha”) _ 13 year old Russian exchange student and Quasar of iron. He has a dark past, which fails to grip the viewer making him even more unlikable than he already is. For some unclear reason he gets into a mutual love relationship with the female lead Mafuyu.<br />
<br />
Oribe, Mafuyu _ around 15 years old. She is an uninteresting character, which only serves as the love interest of our MC. Her stubbornness and misjudgment of all the important scenes made her unbearable.<br />
<br />
Tomo Yamanobe _ around 15 years old. She has the biggest breasts in the show. She is the one Mafuyu promised to protect. I have to give props to Toyasaki Aki, her voice actress, for the voice acting of both the female Tomo and the manly quasar of gold. Her childish personality was really enjoyable, giving refreshment to the rest of the bland characters.<br />
<br />
Ekaterina Kurae (“Katja”) _ (no idea about her age) She is a masochistic loli and was for me the only enjoyable character in the cast. The show started off promising torturous scenes, which she embodied perfectly. Sadly enough the show didn’t deliver those as it progressed, giving Katja even less screen time and making it even less enjoyable than it already was.<br />
<br />
(those are the only characters worth mentioning)<br />
________________________________________<br />
The story revolves around our Russian exchange student called “Sasha”. He is a quasar and has a job to do in Japan. On my first watch (and I’ll be damned if it isn’t the last) it was unclear what his goal was exactly, since you easily lost focus every now and then because of the seemingly scheduled soma feast, our important characters had to go through every episode.<br />
<br />
In the first 12 episodes you get introduced to the protagonists and their friends with some backstories here and there. The show starts off depicting a torturous murder on a young girl. Regardless of the presentation, I somewhat liked this kind of tone but soon enough it was clear this was going to be bad take on a shounen series with tons of fan service. In the next episodes you see “seemingly pointless fighting”, which turns out to be the master plan of the evil guys, to prepare our Sasha to be sacrificed for some reason (because that always works out...). <br />
<br />
Surprisingly enough there was a good episode in this mess.(I will now take a detour to describe the only good moment in the show) <br />
I have to give credit to episode 6 of the series, since it was the only episode in the series where I said: “wow they did something right”. Our gang of friends has to play maids for the rich girl, Tsujidou, Miyuri, so they can get a key for some villa to find something. While fooling around they get raided by a group of hired Russian soldiers who were ordered to find some sort of magical egg. At that point our main cast was consisting of tied up attractive underage girls and a boy who were lustfully glared upon by pleasure seeking soldiers. Everyone who hasn’t lived under a rock will surely know what is about to happen. Surprisingly enough the rich girl decides to sacrifice herself and offers to strip for the soldiers, so her beloved friends can get out safe. In an earlier dialogue the loli of the cast, stated that she is like jewelry, once you get bored of it or it loses its worth you throw it away. This is how she indirectly described her relationship with the rich girl, who is obsessed with wealth, as something temporary depending on how long she can last as her “little princess”. The stripping scene was accompanied by a melancholic piano which made you care for the first and last time about any character in this show. The loli ends up wanting to strip too and takes sip of soma while at it, so she can brutally massacre the soldiers and satisfy the viewers, in the meantime developed, cathartic thirst. The episode ends with the commander of the soldier group committing suicide and blowing the whole place up. Miraculously, our cast of characters survives. After this the show went downhill, dropping the themes and atmosphere developed earlier. But let’s get to the second half of the show.<br />
<br />
Episode 13 and 14 are to be labeled as pure fan service (although eps 14 was somewhat unique and slightly fun to watch with the rich girl being a superhero or what not BUT this will get too long if I start talking about another episode in detail. In short: “boob lasers” and “reminded me a bit of Gurren Lagann”).<br />
<br />
In the remaining episodes 15-24 the story goes really fast to reach the finish line. Introducing more Characters no one cares about with some of them ending up getting killed, and letting characters die who were established in the first half (no one from the main cast though). Our MC, Sasha, is now powered up and ready to fight the end boss. With the help of his friends, and the big breasts of Mafuyu, he somehow succeeds, defying all the established power levels in the story this far. The Last fight doesn’t make sense at all; victory isn’t achieved by any masterful strategic battle plan to defeat the superior enemy, but by the inability of the final antagonist to instakill the whole cast (as we have seen him do in other scenes), because of… reasons…? I don’t know, I get really angry when bad guys mess up for no reason at all and give the good guys an easy win…<br />
<br />
After the final fight most of the new characters, which didn’t end up dying, just disappear and don’t matter anymore, but hey I guess that’s what happens when you defeat the end boss. In my opinion, the Hydrogen and Carbon Quasar combo should be able to annihilate everything, but they only get one fight, which ends up being pointless.<br />
<br />
In the last Eps Sasha has to leave because his job is done, letting us watch him and Mafuyu being together for the last time. This would be a heartwarming episode, but only if we actually cared for them or simply understood why those two got into a relationship in first place.<br />
________________________________________<br />
The quality of the show is on relatively low standards, considering it’s a 2010 show. It looks and is animated even worse than older shows like Studio Deen’s Fate/Stay Night. All the character designs look like uninspired textbook shounen characters. Most of the fights are portrayed in a way which does not require good animation nor choreography, and if it does… then we have Deen-like movements. <br />
<br />
Music was used to make scenes emotional, but as stated before the generic dark backstories don’t sell well. You end up not even caring if someone gets hurt or has his loved ones getting killed in front of his eyes. In other words: nothing noteworthy.<br />
________________________________________<br />
Enjoyment was nearly inexistent for me. The constant slap to the face of boobs, panties and lewd scenes made it unwatchable, even forcing me to pause and tab away for some minutes… or hours. It’s clear as day that this show was made with the clear aim to make it appeal to certain demographics, such as horny 13 year olds or hard core ecchi fans. I don’t belong to any of those and thus this show was a big miss for me in the end (as expected). If the show was presented in a more mature way, or just kept its tone and atmosphere from the first episode I would have enjoyed it a bit. But then again I wouldn’t have watched it in the first place. It’s like saying “if the show was better it wouldn’t be bad” so it doesn’t matter in the end.<br />
For the interested in numbers:<br />
Characters: 4/10<br />
Story: 2/10<br />
Enjoyment: 1/10<br />
Overall: 1/10<br />
<br />
(Art and sound didnt leave any impression which could influence the overall quality/enjoement and were thus neglected)<br />

If you think you can jerk off to minors sucking each other’s breasts in borderline pornographic presentation and scenes, then this show is for you. If not then be happy to leave.<br />

    Overview<br />
<br />
What happens when you take plot elements from Fullmetal Alchemist, Hellsing Ultimate, and D.Gray-man, then mix them into a bad hentai? The answer is something quite abhorrent. Seikon no Qwaser isn&#039;t just your everyday bad echii. This one ups the ante and has a 12 year old boy and a 10 year old girl sucking the breasts of women in their older teens and engaging in various sexual acts. In episode 3, a 10 year old girl threatens to kill an older teen if she doesn&#039;t consent to giving her cunnilingus. Fortunately, we don&#039;t actually have to see this. We only see the little girl&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review154989">
        face and hear the lapping sounds thanks to a discretion shot. Otherwise, this series wouldn&#039;t even be legal under United States Federal Law. It only gets worse from there. This series would make Vladimir Nabokov, the creator of the Loli genre, blush with shame. I am not a squeamish prude. My favorite anime is Elfen Lied. Seikon no Qwaser made me feel very, very uncomfortable!<br />
<br />
Story 2/10<br />
<br />
There are many wizards called Qwasers capable of bending specific elements to their whim. A secret arm of the Russian Orthodox Church has some of the most powerful wizards and uses them to hunt heratic wizards. The most powerful of the church&#039;s paladins is Alexander Hell. This is of course not to be confused with Hellsing&#039;s secret arm of the Catholic Church and their heretic hunting paladin Alexander Anderson. This is totally different! It is up to Alexander or &quot;Sasha&quot; to kick ass with his scythe and protect his harem of big breasted ladies. How does he get his awesome powers? By graphically sucking their tits and drinking the milk of course! How else would a wizard get his powers? Apparently one underraged Russian isn&#039;t enough and soon the Church sends another one called Ekaterina to assist Alexander. The story pretty much solely consists of fight scenes and sucking tits. The writer also has a rudimentary knowledge of chemistry and tries to show it off so frequently that even Kurt Vonnegut would tell him to knock it off!<br />
<br />
Characters: 1/10<br />
<br />
Oh dear god do the characters suck in this one. Alexander is in the running for the most 2 dimensional Russian stereotype character in all of anime. His only rivals are Zangief from Street Fighter and Russia himself from Hetalia. The really sad thing is that Alexander is the best character in this piece of shit. We also have generic tsundere girl and clueless bimbo with ridiculously huge tits. Of course the psychotic loli Ekaterina shows up later, but she has as much character depth as the shallow end of the pool. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art 7/10<br />
<br />
Surprisingly the art in this anime isn&#039;t bad. This thing actually had a budget and clearly had decent animators working on it. The tits look very...succulent<br />
<br />
Soundtrack 7/10<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is also one of the few highlights of this series. It is genuinely pretty decent and boasts catchy opening and closing themes as well as background music.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 1/10<br />
<br />
If you are in this one for the plot, firstly you are an idiot, secondly you are going to be very disappointed. If you are in this for the porn, the pedo scenes will make that boner go away faster than seeing Larry King naked on a cold day. It is possible to enjoy Seikon no Qwaser... if you are a pedophile or clinically insane.<br />
<br />
Overall 1/10<br />
<br />
This is one of the worst anime to come out in the last 5 years. There has been a lot of crap and admittedly I haven&#039;t seen Pupa and Boko no Piko, but this one can proudly hold its own in a sucking contest with the worst of the worst.

    This series had potential behind it, except they went overboard.<br />
<br />
The powers that the characters have are quite well thought of, the battles, although they&#039;ve been seen 1000 times everywhere else, could have made for an interesting plot. <br />
<br />
One major mistake, mixing some sort of power potion, with church, with breast milk... What could they have been thinking? Ok there have been other shows where powers had to b obtained by method of consummation, but what is this? Alexander, one of the main characters in the plot suddenly stops fighting, drinks from the nun&#039;s breast, and kicks the bad guys butt all the way back to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22652">
        hell.... What are you taking when writing (or drawing, or editing, or replaying, etc., etc., etc.,) this anime before actually taking it to the TV Lineup Executives.<br />
<br />
And on that note, what did the TV Station think when they saw this show, did they even see it, could they not think the same think as everyone else is thinking? <br />
<br />
Interesting.....<br />
<br />
Well it must be to get the ultimate pervert audience so that they can sell Adult Oriented Stuff on TV during commercial breaks.<br />
<br />
Well so unless your into a show that just has big breasts, some sort of recycled plot, and makes very little or no sense, then you will enjoy this show.<br />
<br />
The rest of you stay clear of this show!<br />

    Qwaser is quite the weird one... I went in expecting this to be hilariously bad but I ended up rather impressed with it. I&#039;m currently only to episode 21, but even if it declines from here, I still enjoyed the goodness while it lasted.<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
It&#039;s a very weird premise. Religion, the Periodic Table, dominatrix loli&#039;s and...Breast milk? I don&#039;t know how they made it work but it sure did. It&#039;s kept me hooked for quite a while, and it has just enough comedy to keep it from being too intense, but it doesn&#039;t cause the story to suffer any. 70% of the episodes open with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27431">
        an ecchi &#039;treat&#039; for the viewers, and there&#039;s definitely quite a bit of ecchi in the show itself. I don&#039;t think it makes the story any less enjoyable, but I can understand how it would make it less entertaining for others.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
It&#039;s really pretty. Even though towards the beginning, a lot of the..suckling scenes were recycled, but as it went on that didn&#039;t happen as much. The battle scenes are intense and awesome, but it seems that they&#039;re cut pretty short, most of the time. I suppose it&#039;s better than having them drag out through several episodes and overstay their welcome.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
I wasn&#039;t thoroughly impressed with it. I do like both of the openings and endings, though. The voice acting is nice, very fitting. <br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
Most of the characters are pretty good. Until later episodes, Mafuyu is rather boring. Tomo is so innocent yet lacks a shred of modesty, leading to some very funny material, which is why she&#039;s my favorite. I don&#039;t really have any complaints about any of the characters. I just wished Teresa had more screen time, she&#039;s absolutely adorable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
I really do love this show. I initially thought it was going to be stupid and just a big fanservice bonanza but I was really impressed with it&#039;s execution.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10<br />
It&#039;s not exactly something you can suggest to all of your friends, as ecchi is not everyone&#039;s cup of tea, but for those who enjoy  that kind of thing may want to try.

    Okay...i have read a lot of reviews and most of them seem so negative.<br />
They all sound similar&quot; If you are a pervwerted hentai lover and a guy you&#039;ll like the boobs of tomo&quot;<br />
1.I&#039;m a girl.The boobs of Tomo seem ridiculous and even a bit ugly to me :P<br />
2.I still really enjoy this anime.Why?<br />
When i say the anime  in the list i wanted to check it , cause i found it interesting to see how Japanese will portrait russians and orthodox religion(i&#039;m half russian lo)<br />
Than the first episode was rather dissapointing with the cliche story about the clumsy ,stupid and big boobed girl and her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review26996">
        &quot;Guardian&quot;.Not mentioning the extreme ecchiness..<br />
But than the fight really impressed me.And also the character (Alexander) is really very cool , at least in my oppinion.I just like such antisocial guys , who appear to be very kind eventually :P<br />
Than Mafuyu became more interesting as a character for me.And i liked the idea of controlling elements.<br />
That with the soma is also quite an interesting idea,only annoying thing is that girls&#039; clothes are being ripped off all the time :P It&#039;s quite disturbing, but oh well.<br />
Also i really like the &quot;loli&quot; aka Ekaterina.She is just very fun to watch and also looks like a little doll , but kinda evil.Okay, i must admit i don&#039;t like the ecchi part of that character .<br />
Maybe it&#039;s just my normal wish for a touch of romance, but i suspect something quite nice in that aspect aswell.Interesting, this time the guy is so young :P<br />
And about the sound.The first opening was cool, than the second is a bit too gothic- religious or whatever.<br />
               I might be going mad, watching so much ecchiness, but i really enjoyed this.Haha

    Every once in a while you come across an anime that is so far outside the realm of normality that you simply can’t help but be amazed. This can be either for better or for worse but regardless of which it’ll generally leave a more lasting impression.<br />
<br />
When it comes to Seikon no Qwaser, it made me feel progressively stupider while I was watching it. This simply has to be the strangest concept I’ve ever seen for a story, but it somehow makes it work. First off I would like to say that this show is NOT for everyone. The term ecchi is nowhere near enough

          <span style="display: none;" id="review121363">
        to describe the extent of SnQ. I’ve seen plenty of quite borderline H anime in my career, but this has to take the cake. The strange thing is that despite that, the way the show uses its extreme perverseness is actually secondary. In reality, Seikon no Qwaser is an action/super power series and shouldn’t even be classified as neither a romance nor a harem series. It just so happens that all the supernatural abilities in the show are powered… by sucking breast milk from women.<br />
<br />
The story is very simplistic and cliché; you’ve got your male protagonist surrounded by heaps of women and they’re constantly being targeted by bad guys as everyone is competing over trying to find a lost artifact which supposedly can grant its user the power of god… or something like that. The characters are split into two halves; you’ve got the “Qwasers” which are the supernatural guys who get their powers from sucking breast milk, or “Soma”, from the other supporting half, where the donators are called “Marias”. As absurd as it is, it’s pretty straightforward once you’ve finally accepted just what the hell you are actually watching.<br />
<br />
The fights themselves are pretty interesting though. Every Qwaser is unique, as he/she is connected to a specific element on the periodic table, allowing him/her to manipulate said substance at will and use that in any which way thinkable for fighting. The amount of energy available to do so is based on the strength of the Qwaser and how much Soma he/she has digested beforehand.<br />
<br />
The character cast is at first glance pretty damn stereotypical. You’ve got the standard harem situation with the protagonist surrounded by a tsundere, an airhead and the silent but loyal and obedient old friend. The protag himself however is not exactly your average one, as he’s a cold hearted, mechanical and revenge driven young lad. Actually when I say young lad I really mean it, he’s basically a shota compared to the heroine cast, and is also a pretty huge tsundere himself. Last but not least, the final two main characters are a bit more standalone… as they share the wonderful combination of a lolicon/yuri/BDSM coupling, and quite frankly they were easily the most interesting duo to watch throughout the entire series, especially the pseudo-gothic twintailed loli dominatrix Katja voiced by Aya Hirano. They also had some extremely borderline H scenes together, unlike the mere constant breastfeeding throughout the anime. As far as side characters go though, they were pretty damn forgettable.<br />
<br />
Visuals and audio weren’t anything particularly memorable. The whole idea of basing super powers on chemistry allowed for quite a lot of unorthodox action scenes to take place, but even so the animation wasn’t anything really worth praising. As far as the soundtrack goes, neither the OP, ED nor overall OST comes to mind either. In fact I can’t even remember what either sounded like even now, right after finishing the series. The seiyuu cast and performance was pretty good though overall, albeit somewhat varied in individual quality.<br />
<br />
By far the best part about Seikon no Qwaser though is its entertainment value. Coming into this, I was somewhat prepared for that it would be a very strange experience, but as far as the actual enjoyment went, I have to admit I was really positively surprised. I had a ton of fun marathoning through all of this. Even if the crazy amount of boobs plastered all over the screen isn’t exactly my type of thing, in this particular case I somehow didn’t really mind. It’s such an abstract show that I couldn’t help but feel interested in it for the wtf-factor alone. SnQ isn’t an ecchi anime meant to turn you on. In fact, 90% of its sexual showings will most likely creep you out more than anything, but before long you will stop thinking about it as anything more than a supporting aspect of what is in actuality an action series. Hell even the girls themselves don’t seem to act like its anything out of the ordinary.<br />
<br />
Overall, despite its creepiness and absurdity, I wholeheartedly enjoyed this anime a lot more than I had expected coming into it. Admittedly though, it’s pretty damn hard to rate, and I can see pretty much any score for it being understandable given how extreme it is, but in the end, the reason people watch anime is for entertainment, and in that aspect at least, Seikon no Qwaser manages to deliver well above expectations.

    Seikon no Qwaser is for me an underrated anime. It has 24 episodes and focuses on the fight against an evil group. The one fighting them is a small boy named &quot;Sasha&quot; who manipulates iron (the fighting theme is about manipulation of the chemical elements-just like using iron or copper and so on)...<br />
<br />
Well the interesting part is that he gains his powers by sucking from the breasts of the girls around him. Sounds more like a hentai but it is one of those ecchi animes like Queens Blade (if you know it), only that Seikon no Qwaser is taking it a little further. Still you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32613">
        will only see breasts and such because it is after all an ecchi. Now it is actually a real fun part if you watch the uncensored version. I reccommand it...<br />
<br />
Characters and story are all kept pretty simple though. You will see most of the typical anime girl types from shy to bold. But at least it follows a slight storyline.<br />
For the setting, drawing and fights: Setting is taking place around school mostly. Not so much to tell. But for the drawing, I was pretty surprised by the way it looks like. You will enjoy watching most of the girls. And now fights, it is a more episodic pattern of how the fights go but still showing off some nice moves. So some action is also included.<br />
<br />
I just want to add that the music was really one of the best parts of the anime. All the openings and ending were pretty catchy and got even better. Even if you don&#039;t like the anime, the music is great.<br />
<br />
So it might seems like an ecchi trash anime with nothing special in it but it is entertaining...and with entertaining I mean that you shouldn&#039;t take it serious if you want to enjoy it. If you expect too much from it then you will fail. If you are into a little more harder sucking ecchi then you can or should check it out. I won&#039;t reccomand it if you search for something great or serious. And don&#039;t watch it censored if you know what is good for you. Finally if you are a fan of simple ecchi fighting animes then you will like it. I will give it a decent rating because it was overall good enough.

    I started watching this series because the concept sounded pretty lulzy - after all, it&#039;s about breast sucking and gaining magic powers from it. But I soon realised that this show is literally about nothing albeit petty squabbling over the penis of a tiny exchange student. That being said, everything about it average, especialy the story.<br />
<br />
Story: 3<br />
After you get over the whole breast sucking fiasco and get involved in the story, you realise how little there really is. It&#039;s about the foreign exchange student, crashing daily student life and the first portion of the series is pretty reverse haremy. However, it slowly degrades into a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30917">
        villain of the week and the wading through that particular marsh isn&#039;t worth the very average ending.<br />
<br />
Art: 5<br />
Average, it&#039;s not bad but not good either. The fight scenes are relatively impressive, and the detail to the breast sucking is well done. The extreme breast physics when he extracts soma from them is pretty hilarious; and the characters themselves are rather nicely drawn and fit with the dark theme. The first few episodes were fairly good, but the art wanes as you progress through the series.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5<br />
The first opening is very catchy; and the second one not so much. The endings with all the voice actors is also particularly impressive. The OST is essentially the one of the defining features of this show, as it sets the dark, dreary mood despite the crazy breast feasting occuring. That being said, none of the songs haven&#039;t stayed with since the time the show finished - meaning the music didn&#039;t have that much of an impression on me.<br />
<br />
Character: 6<br />
As per usual, harems have fairly good character development in exchange for a cromulent storyline. Seikon no Qwaser sacrifices even more character development for ecchi scenes. But over the course of the 24 episode, characters were able to be somewhat develop - but no where to the extent of other girls in other, similar length series. That being said, character development is the only saving grace for this anime - because really, there is nothing else. I also hate Tomo - those characters anger me so much. She&#039;s so useless and disgusting, yet they dedicate X episodes to give her some sort of use. It&#039;s a waste of your time.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7<br />
There is nothing more great than laughing at an anime which attempts to be legitimate. This anime has proven that. The concept of drinking breast milk to increase ones strength is absolutely hilarious. I laughed for hours and hours and hours. If this series was 12 episodes, it would&#039;ve been much more success. But 24 episode of this rubbish? I don&#039;t think so. I didn&#039;t necessarily look forward to watching one episode every week, but it was watchable. The voice acting was probably the best part of this anime, but much like anime such as Queen&#039;s Blade, no amount of voice acting can help you trawl your way through this anime. Though, Chihara Minori&#039;s sexy moaning is pretty sexy.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
This anime promises breast sucking, but unfortunately takes this concept a little bit too far. Getting powerups from drinking the delicious milk of your female friends is pretty lulzy, but using an ecchi as a plot device isn&#039;t going to work out well. It&#039;s a stimulent which gets your penis going. It is not a concept to be explored; and definitely not the ground for an anime.<br />
<br />
tl;dr <br />
The story is about breast sucking. Watch it for lulz, but if you expect even the slightest bit more, you&#039;re going to be disappointed.

    And I thought Eiken was the most unbearable piece of garbage I&#039;ve seen from anime. Whereas Eiken had no plot whatsoever in its ridiculously ecchi antics, this turd attempts to create a cookie-cutter shounen action anime mixed in with enough perverted material that made it hard for me to even watch at points. Seikon no Qwaser&#039;s gimmick with its ecchi content comes in the form of the superpowered beings called Qwasers having to suck on breast milk to grant them their elemental/ metal manipulating powers. With this gimmick also comes plenty of instances where you can see rape-like situations and moments of sadomasochism from its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review69889">
        cast. The problem with implementing this ecchi content for Seikon no Qwaser is that implementing its breast-sucking scenes and other perverted content in serious moments like action scenes and character development make them look more creepy, awkward and uncomfortable than immersible for any sane viewer, and the gimmick really does enough to get in the way of any relevant elements to the title&#039;s plot.<br />
<br />
If you strip away the breast sucking, perversion, attempted rapes and sadomasochism though, you have nothing more than a typical story of revenge coming from Sasha&#039;s tragic past and encounters with the secret cult known as Adepts with plans of world domination, along with a cast of archetypal characters you would see done to death from enough high school/ fan service titles like the clumsy ditz (Tomo), the ojou (Miyuri), the sharp-tongued and manipulative loli (Katja) and the tomboy (Elizabeth). The villains among the Adepts are mostly nothing more than either your garden variety mook serving to get offed by Sasha and other Qwasers or a power-hungry loon who thinks he is better than everyone and wants to rule the world. The first half of the anime mostly features Sasha offing the different mooks of the Adepts and much of the second half is where the Adepts execute their big plan of world domination that Sasha and the other Qwasers have to stop, with the second half developments coming along after some pretty pathetic attempts at comedy with one notable character gaining amnesia for a couple episodes. In other words, the plot to this anime is just one huge excuse for its breast-sucking gimmick and other perverted content.<br />
<br />
In terms of visuals, Seikon no Qwaser is rather standard in its presentation with decent-looking scenery and character designs. While animation shortcuts are apparent with this series at a number of points, Qwaser battles were engaging to a degree thanks to the abilities of the Qwasers to manipulate their individual elements. The very frequent appearance of huge boobs bobbing and bouncing around at enough points, however, does kill any enjoyment one would want to get from the Qwaser battles thanks to how annoyingly distracting they are.<br />
<br />
Overall, Seikon no Qwaser is nothing more than just another ecchi show trying to find another creepy gimmick to get its sex-crazed otaku fanbase gawking over huge boobs and perversion, while using standard character archetypes and plot cliches as a crutch for its ecchi antics. Unless you have a thing for any imaginable ecchi content, definitely don&#039;t waste your time on it.

    I originally decided to pick this up because I was told of an action series in which people literally sucked on a girl&#039;s nipple for energy to fight, yet is not a porn. In other words, it was out of sheer curiosity as to whether or not such a thing would lead to catastrophe or not. And surprisingly enough, it didn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll start by letting you know this over the top fanservice will most likely either drive you away in disgust or keep you glued to the screen while shedding tears of joy. I&#039;m sure some people will just laugh it off or ignore it as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33208">
        well, but it can be pretty polarizing.<br />
<br />
Story: 7:/10. The story doesn&#039;t really stray from typical shounen plot, but does make use of a few really interesting concepts. For one, it&#039;s characters all have powers born of an element from the periodic table (Hydrogen, Mercury, Iron, etc.) and not the usual elements used for this sort of thing (fire, water, earth, etc.) This makes for some rather creative and enjoyable fights throughout the series. Another is it&#039;s use of the Christianity in the plot, like a painting of the virgin Mary breastfeeding Jesus containing the power of God. There have certainly been series to do a better job incorporating religion (See: Chrono Crusade), but I&#039;ll admit that I surprisingly happy with it considering it was an ero anime.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10. The art for this series is pretty well done, although much of the work clearly goes into breast animation (again, something you either be really happy or really sad about), ass shots. The fighting was rather well done, another surprise for a show of this premise. Overall, I was pleased with the quality.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10. The &quot;bad shit is happening&quot; track sounded well placed, but everything else was pretty forgettable. This includes both opening and ending themes.<br />
<br />
Character: 6/10. Alexander was honestly the only interesting character in the series. With the exception of him, everyone else conformed to some archetype or another almost perfectly. The idea of a of a really short badass who looks like an emo goth sounds ridiculous, but it&#039;s honestly the best way to describe him and it worked out rather well. He also has a pretty unique scar carved into the side of his face.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10. The enjoyment you get from this series all hinges upon how you deal with the fanservice. If you really don&#039;t like looking at naked cartoon characters, then this isn&#039;t the series for you. If that&#039;s your thing, prepare for a full course meal of it.

    This show is actually fantastic. The storyline isn&#039;t the most unique in the world but it is actually pretty good. I couldn&#039;t help but download it after I read the synopsis of it. Big boobs, tons of fanservice, weird fighting and an almost all half naked female cast. I thought it would be good for a few laughs.<br />
<br />
Then I started watching it and couldn&#039;t stop. The storyline was actually good enough to draw me in. The artwork is done very well, and the sound quality is top-notch. The fighting is almost non existant actually. There is a little here and a little there. But it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25611">
        isn&#039;t Dragon Ball Z style. A fight starts, a few seconds later someone is in a million pieces.<br />
<br />
Overall this show is mostly about fanservice. And it has all kinds. Nothing crazy kinky yet. But enough that if you don&#039;t like a little S&amp;M you probably shouldn&#039;t watch this. <br />
<br />
I would say that if you like hentai with good artwork, some decent characters and an above par storyline, then you should deffinately give this show a shot.

    So, when i read some reviews about the anime i was like, tits....sucking....powers? Aight im in. the story goes like, theres these two chicks 1 with huge cow tites, and the other with softball tits, they&#039;re like sisters nd shit or something, and they get bullied a lot by some small tit bitch and some big tit bitch. One day some random bitch goes all crazy on them and is stealing the tit milk of the girls of the area because tit milk has power. THEN!! this white haired kid and some cat ear haired bitch save the day, after he sucks her tites.<br />
<br />
^^so yeahh

          <span style="display: none;" id="review117729">
        thats the first episode. My thoughts on the series, were kinda off and on, although i loved the amount of tits, i felt it almost took away from the story they wanted to provide. I know its an Ecchi but i also love story in them like IS, i love the fact that it has 26 or something eps, that made it worth it.<br />
<br />
Story: i give this shit a 6, the tits were totally awesome, so were that ass shots, but i feel like it tried focusing to much on it<br />
<br />
Art: omg the tit art was amazing like it actually showed nipples getting hard, i was amazed, id rate the art 10<br />
<br />
Sound: if you&#039;re into moaning nd shit at the start of the show then aye this shit is all for you, i give it a 10<br />
<br />
Character: the characters were pretty cool, but not much development id like to see, i give it a 6<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: man i cant tell you how many boners i got from watching this shit, the fan service never failed...ever, i give it a 20<br />
<br />
Overall: if you&#039;re looking for a decent anime to kill some time in between your ongoing ones this one is perefect

    Having watched the first two episodes of Seikon no Qwaser I have to say it wasn&#039;t a very impressive way to start a series, although I think my reasoning will be a little different then that of my fellow reviewers :)<br />
<br />
Story - The plot is a fairly average recreation of a lot of other action/ecchi type anime series, the draw-card of course being that the heroes/villains seem to powerup by sucking breast milk. This didn&#039;t bother me that much in principle (ANIME OBJECTIFYING WOMEN?! SAY IT ISN&#039;T SO! :P)  although it would be amusing in the extreme to find out how this can possibly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22979">
        be explained as leading to superpowers. Having only seen the first two epiosdes I can&#039;t say much about the overall story except that its otherwise fairly run of the mill for this genre.<br />
<br />
Art - The art is fairly nice, my only complaint would be with whoever designed Tomo. I understand breasts are going to play a big part in this series but really that&#039;s just ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Sound - Not much to say, nothing stood out as particularly good or bad in the sound department.<br />
<br />
Character - Initial responses to the characters is that they are decent, except for Tomo who seems designed to annoy me (is there some weird market for giant breasts on woman who act like five year olds?). Alex is a jerk but somehow I doubt he will stay one for the whole series, and a big scythe is always a fun weapon.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment -  This is where I&#039;ll get to air my pet peeve with this series and the main thing which made the whole thing awkward to watch and cause a huge dent to my enjoyment. I understand broadcasting people sucking each others chests is probably over the line in a number of ways - but what on earth was the camera doing during those scenes? I get that it has to look somewhere else but you could at least look at SOMETHING in the actual scene, all of those random shots of the sky and awkwardly framed scenes sapped the enjoyment far more then anything else in the series, even more then Tomo (--stab!)<br />
<br />
Overall - aside from the drawcard issue Seikon no Qwaser is just a very average action/ecchi/harem sort of deal. Its perfectly safe to watch it but unless it improves a great deal it&#039;s looking like a very mediocre series. I will actually play devils advocate here and suggest that if an uncensored version does come out it might improve things significantly by the removal of all those weird camera positions (of course if the whole thing freaks you right out then that probably will make things worse - up to you guys :) )

    Safe to read - No Spoilers<br />
<br />
This was recommended by my friend who watches almost every ecchi anime out there, and this was one of the ecchi anime he introduced to me that was good.  You know not the typical common ecchi anime. If I were to describe this anime it would be like you&#039;re in a science labaratory listening to your naked teacher holding a bible while fapping.<br />
<br />
-Story 8-<br />
It a about a russian kid whose name is Aleksander Nikolaevich Hell or Sasha. He&#039;s a qwaser and to tell you what that is do you know legend of Aang or Kora? He&#039;s like the iron

          <span style="display: none;" id="review185661">
        bender, and to use that skill he must suck soma or to simply put it &quot;breast milk&quot;.<br />
<br />
 The story/plot is good it was satisfying to watch .The flow of the story is good, character developement, and good amount of flashbacks. I really watch it for the boobs- I mean plot. I mean really just watch the first episode and the first second starts with the plot already. <br />
<br />
-Art 8- <br />
I like the art because it fits an ecchi anime. Althoug the art isn&#039;t exactly rare or anything amazing it was just the common normal art that almost every anime has. The details is alright. You know panty shots,  and big boobs. <br />
<br />
-Sound 6-<br />
Did not like the music,The OST was dull, it didn&#039;t strike me, you know when you&#039;re sad and the OST just makes you cry, it lack that.  I couldn&#039;t feel the music in fight scenes. The OST and ED I skipped them, it wasn&#039;t really interesting for me. Although the voice actors were good, it fits the faces of the characters.<br />
<br />
-Characters 7-<br />
Character design it&#039;s alright. The characters were weird but good weird cuz it doesn&#039;t make them common characters. The girls in this anime mostly consist of big boobs girl. Really if you want to watch ecchi anime and you have big boob fetish, this one is perfect for you.<br />
<br />
-Enjoyment 8-<br />
I can&#039;t fully enjoy the anime 1 episode and I go to the bathroom. I can&#039;t watch it in 1 go. :S Like I this was recommended by my friend and I don&#039;t really watch ecchi anime but this is great. It has that good plot that I was interested to.<br />
<br />
-Overall 7-<br />
I really recommend for hardcore ecchi fan out there! Has uncensored and censored version though, but who the heck loves censored version?! The uncensored version is very borderline hentai, if action, ecchi, and harem is not your cup of tea don&#039;t watch it. But atleast give it a try.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
 You can learn alot science from the story. Like periodic tables, atom and other things<br />
 <br />
Cons:<br />
 Too much fanservice, cant focus well on the story. To put it simply it relies on fanservice too much.<br />
<br />

    Unlike most reviewers I saw so far, I came for the tits, and stayed for the story. eechii can be found all over the place, and much of it with excellent art, but it&#039;s a rare gem I found in this title, it was actually a fairly engaging plot, well developed characters, and overall, it turned out to be a good show. The jiggling, reminiscent of classics such as Burnup and plastic little. (which if you were a fan who collected DVD&#039;s back then like me, you will recall actually had jiggle counters on the special features in the ADV releases)<br />
Well, all I can say

          <span style="display: none;" id="review53961">
        is this was a fresh take on that, and despite being a new show, it ended up making me feel a tad nostalgic for those kinds of titles. It&#039;s a great series with fanservice thrown into the mix and integrated into it in a way that makes it part of the whole thing instead of just being tits for the sake of tits.<br />
Worth a watch, even if you aren&#039;t into the eechii.
