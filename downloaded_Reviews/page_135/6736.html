        sure if I was part of that category. The show itself takes on the world of anime and rather than using it as a theme, it tells stories through them. It’s super self-aware as every episode makes references and alludes to pop culture. For me, it didn’t take long to realize that Animegataris wanted the viewers to experience what anime is really about. And it all begins with the “anime research club”.<br />
<br />
Taking place at Sakaneko Private High School, the club members essentially all shares their love for anime. Despite their different opinions, they all share a general fundamental view that anime is a form of enthralling entertainment. Minoa Asagaya, a new student is invited to this club by one of their members, Arisu Kamiigusa. It doesn’t take long for her to get hooked into anime. She gets enlightened by the very ideas of anime after participating in some of their activities, getting involved with their conversations, and accepting anime for what it is. To me, this show satires anime as a form of art. It makes many references from some of the most popular works of recent years. (ex. Re:Zero, Girls und Panzer, Boku Hero no Academia) It aims at anime fans in general with its ideas. As the story progresses, the anime research club encounters oppositions, most prominently, the student council. Absurdly powerful and reluctant, they enforce their own principles and practically go to war with them. It adds drama to the show, something that’s actually needed considering how plotless the series feels at times. Other times, the series’ plot focuses more on the adventures of the club such as going on to anime conventions and cosplay events.<br />
<br />
As a show that satires anime, you should definitely expect a diverse circle of characters. Indeed, every character from the anime research club stands out in some way through their persona. We have the oujo-sama Arisu Kamiigusa, light novel enthusiast Miko Koenji, the athletic Yui Obata, delusional Kai Musashisakai, idol fanatic Kouki Nakano, and the club president Erika Aoyama. All of them shares a love anime although each member also shares a love for a particular type. For instance, Erika loves magical girl shows. Kai has a chuunibyou-like obsession with action characters/superheroes. Kouki has a love for idols while Miko is inspired to become a light novelist someday. The point the show is trying to get across is that all these characters embraces the anime culture and hope to share their vision to others. For Minoa, she starts off as a newbie but learns from the club. Each episode shows her knowledge growth about anime and she even begins to make friends outside the club. As a show with a colorful cast, their personalities indeed are also take notice. From the very few episodes, it’s shown that each of them are distinctive. The character chemistry and bond between them is meaningful as well. For instance, they all unite together against the council when they seek to abolish the club. They uphold their values and doesn’t back down. Even at desperate times, the club makes the best with what they have and love. To me, that’s inspirational.<br />
<br />
By the time you go through a few episodes, I think it’ll become obvious that a majority of the show appeals to comedy. I already said that this show is very self-aware and makes references to anime culture. However at times, it also deconstructs the very aspect of anime such as breaking the fourth wall completely. It gives a sense of surreal feel that I haven’t seen done much in recent years. The amount of cosplay and delusional moments also makes an impact through the characters’ roles. (I’m looking at you Kai) The dialogues consists a lot of casual talk that blends between anime culture and everyday language. It’s very easy to get into even despite how deep it gets at times. There’s also a character (Neko-sensei) that brings a supernatural-like side to the show that is strangely addictive to watch. However, I will say that this show isn’t designed for anyone. The general audience may accept the show for what it has its offer but it won’t surprise me if someone finds the series to be particularly dull. There’s an abundance amount of repetitive jokes, some that I find to be absurdly amusing while others come off as dry. (Personally, I think the yaoi-jokes is way overused as an attraction) For the story itself, the show jumps between various styles often from slice of life adventures to dramatic ideal clashes. Hell, the final few episodes of this show can really surprise viewers at the direction it decides to take.<br />
<br />
Adapted by Wao World, I was cautiously optimistic about this work. The raw visual quality of the show isn’t impressive as characters and setting looks average at best. The studio itself doesn’t have an impressive resume either so my expectations weren’t high. However, looking beyond the raw visual quality gave me a different impression. To me, this show even parodies its art style through actual storytelling. The deformed faces and cartoony character designs in specific episodes are done intentionally as a way to deconstruct anime tropes. Hell, even the OP song makes fun of the colorful art style with running gags of certain characters, especially Yui. Cosplay in the show alludes to characters’ persona to match their interest. For fan service, this is again usually portrayed more as a parody rather than shock value. Yui is the guiltiest example because of her athletic body but the rest of the female cast isn’t too far off either; specifically Erika and even Minoa at times. Character facial expressions and body languages are also noticeable for their running gags. I lost count how many times I had to laugh at Kai for his antics.<br />
<br />
For a show as lighthearted as Animegataris, it has some surprisingly catchy music. Both the OP and ED theme songs are highly decorated with the usual gages from the show itself. It also feels like there are influences to the show’s OST. Some tracks sounds similar such as those from the show, Haruhi Suzumiya. Character voice mannerism definitely delivered in particular for characters such as Kai and Neko-sensei. I can’t say this enough but the voices of the characters in this show always sound alive and attracts attention.<br />
<br />
As a show that was based on the original Anime-Gatari, this anime stepped up to the plate with its themes, style, and humor. I wasn’t sold on what it had to offer at first but after giving it a chance, it quickly won me over. It’s strangely addictive watching the everyday lifestyles of the anime research club. Every character stood out in some way from this show that I came to enjoy watching. While the story isn’t written well at times, it still stays honest with its general premise and genres. As an anime fan who has been watching anime for years, I feel serviced.

    This anime was great! I&#039;m kind of a novice to anime, but I don&#039;t many who love anime. It kind of related to me. <br />
It is a parody anime with a lot of anime references and anime jokes. I liked it because it was fun trying to figure out the references.<br />
I noticed a few like Ru:Zero, Anosuba, Autumn Wars, PreFae, and I think Guden Daran. <br />
The story is very slice of life but the last 2 episodes were just crazy.<br />
Character ideas were really creative and thought into. <br />
The art looked pretty amazing as well.<br />
It was overall an amazing anime and I rate it 8/10!<br />

    It makes sense that if anime characters in an anime start talking about anime in their anime club then something strange has to happen on a (meta?)-physical level within their own story. Animegataris is a school-club comedy anime that sets itself up on a self-aware journey that (kind of) explores why anime otaku appreciate anime so much. And the best way to do that is through its own medium (of course).<br />
<br />
There is a lot of anime in this anime. They talk about anime, they make an anime, they become an &#039;anime.&#039; if this anime is going to be known for anything as this season peters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266258">
        out and some late-comers decide to give it a try, is the stylistic and plot-break down &#039;twist.&#039; However, it isn&#039;t much of a twist if the anime literally becomes stranger every episode. What could have been a last ditch effort to make something fun as the series winds down, ends up being a completely sensible conclusion, that if anyone was paying attention, they&#039;d probably see coming. It&#039;s ridiculous, purposefully so, and that&#039;s what makes it so fun. <br />
<br />
The references are usually oblique or universal enough, that the series doesn&#039;t get bogged down with &#039;hey we all watched that&#039; kind of humor. Animegataris doesn&#039;t latch  on to any one niche or franchise to parody or make reference to. Instead we get a a cornucopia of verbal and sometimes visual references, which  considering the show is about anime otaku, seems par for the course. But obviously, nobody is going to watch this show for stuff like &quot;Dirlish Number (or whatever the fuck they called it) was good.&quot; It&#039;s the self-aware, tongue-in-cheek, &#039;we&#039;re winking at you&#039; humor and sensibility which makes Animegataris so fun, and funny.<br />
<br />
The comedy works. That is, if you&#039;ve seen enough anime to appreciate a cliche for its own sake.There&#039;s some genuinely funny stuff here: flubbed lines in some shitty anime short, odd attention to detail, &#039;the aspect ratio is closing in.&#039; Fan-service sports girls hardly has any lines, yet she gets her own OP, definitely the most ingenious thing I&#039;ve seen this season. (Ironically enough, even though she is hardly a character, fan-service girl still has her cameo in the anime within the anime). There is a sense of &#039;we can get away with whatever, so deal with it&#039; as the anime moves along, but you actually excuse the staff, because instead of being over the top and obnoxious, it comes across as smart and tastefully done as is possible for a show like this.  <br />
<br />
For something more recent to compare it to, this reminds me of Akiba&#039;s Trip. But for the most part, this series really reminds me of, and has the sensibility of otaku oriented parody OVAs. A much less cynical Otaku no Video or Puni Puni Poemii, or maybe a more genre specific one like Nurse Witch Komugi-chan, or maybe Ribbon-chan and (though  TV and not a parody), Going-Home Club (KKK), for both of those have an all  too aware, budget conscious  &#039;the staff knows it&#039;s going to fail&#039;&#039; kind of humor. Other recommendations: Comic Party, Animation Runner Kuromi<br />
<br />
There are plenty of anime fans who would appreciate something like this, but too many are going to ignore it for dumb reasons. It&#039;s worth a watch if you want your anime to be a little too much like anime.

    This was a fine story destroyed by fanservice. And I&#039;m here writing this only cuz I&#039;m f* tired of it.<br />
<br />
Ok, I get it. Dudes were trying to show all the aspects of a japanese animation, but they felt on the most ridiculous points of cliché and &quot;chuunibyou&quot; syndrome ever... <br />
<br />
First of all, If the anime is not gendered as ecchi, PLEASE DON&#039;T PUT ECCHI SCENES ON IT! Jesus christ mary and joseph! I&#039;m sick and tired of this shit everywhere. It&#039;s really frustrating trying to watch a quality anime and see it falling into the roughest possible traps. I felt like I was watching a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263210">
        much trashier version of K-ON! And I like K-ON!, but this... Oh god. I can&#039;t.<br />
<br />
But please, don&#039;t get me wrong. I really saw potential in this story. The idea of passing on minimal details of production, dubbing or details of Japanese culture in general seemed extremely interesting. But the problem is: it did not sound that way. It sounded forced, blasé. Honestly, I&#039;d be really scared to encounter such a nerdy otaku like the characters in this series. They look like damn traveling encyclopedias (not kidding). Kinda of ruins the idea of normal fan and starts to give an idea of obsessed fans. Not a big deal but then it wasn&#039;t even funny... Besides, it looked like one of those awkward advertisement where the lines are so forced that they seem too mechanical and.. well, cringy.<br />
<br />
I REALLY hate fanservice, but hey, we are talking about anime, so, f*, that shit is really everywhere, ruining everything and there&#039;s nothing you can do about it. So I can manage some level of fanservice depending on the quality of the story, although I still hate it. But there comes a time when it gets really annoying. Then, comes the plot, that was fine but again, shoved unnecessary scenes that are only there to make you feel uncomfortable (unless you are a pervert, and in that case you are a creep).<br />
<br />
Btw, those scenes showing the intimate parts of Yui while exercising at every beginning of episode in a TOTALLY disconnected way with the story? Cheeky fanservice... Gosh. And please don&#039;t talk to me about &quot;reference&quot; bullshit. Kill la Kill was doing reference (somehow). Not this. <br />
<br />
You know, there is no need to throw a girl on a guy&#039;s pelvis and make her rub her boobs on him to make the story look romantic. Geez, as a girl I feel sincerely angry about it. It&#039;s not only stupid, it&#039;s degrading... I could stay here for ages talking boring stuff about how Japanese culture (all of it, but ok) of animation in general is highly sexist and sometimes worse (please forgive me Hayao Miyazaki, you sir are not included). So it is very disappointing to find female characters that you can relate to and then watch it fall onto stereotypes, or end up on stories which encourages futile female rivalries, creates objectified characters - and of course, fanservice or clichés that border the ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Besides, the art is confusing. Drawing does not look consistent. Scenarios are beautiful and everything. The problem is the characters itself. Their design is very different from one character to another, as if they belonged to different animes (it may be purposeful, but it does not look aesthetically ok). Also, Minoa&#039;s hair is... really... Weird.<br />
<br />
Sound is fine too. Nothing relevant to talk about it. And I really like talking about OST, so I&#039;m kinda disappointed.<br />
<br />
Character development is virtually nonexistent or absurdly explosive. In one day they seem one thing and then, suddenly, they look like something else. You know that K-ON! thing I said before? So, Minoa is like a silliest version of Yui. And you will find similarities all over.<br />
<br />
Overall, if it wasn&#039;t for those stupid fanservice scenes, I would probably be able to watch it until the end, but I can&#039;t. I just can&#039;t.  <br />
<br />
So, if you too can&#039;t stand cliché and being bored to death while watching an anime that is trying too hard to explain how anime works, don&#039;t even start it.<br />
<br />

    The story is about a group of people restarting the anime club at their school. So this is another club anime, just another club anime. it does nothing to set it apart from the others. It&#039;s the same plotline and tropes you have seen in other club anime from the cosplay to the conventions. It doesn&#039;t do these tropes even better or worse than other shows it is just that if you have seen one of these you&#039;ve seen most of them.<br />
<br />
The art isn&#039;t anything special generic cute characters and animation. The mascot is different at least (as much as it can be.) but that&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262652">
        the only thing that stands out.<br />
<br />
The music and characters are also what you would expect going into this. The voice actors can be typed cast by their voices and the music is upbeat. You&#039;ll probably forget about all of it.<br />
<br />
The characters like I alluded to before aren&#039;t special. I could probably list at least ten clones for each of their personalities easily. If you are newer to anime or just adore these series they work but the more you get into these club animes the more tired you get to them. I&#039;m not saying club anime are bad I just want different at this point especially coming off of Gamers which did different well and tried it&#039;s best to be its own thing.<br />
<br />
5/10 overall. If I was newer to anime I would love this but, since I&#039;m not, I&#039;m just bored watching this. If you have watched one of these, you&#039;ve seen most of them.

    If I could say anything that seems to sum up my final thoughts, it is merely this—full of itself.  The anime is like a stuck up piece of trash that sees itself as something greater than it is.  All this show is, is one shitty attempted plot-twist after another.  They even throw in a little pathetic attempt at &quot;love?&quot; and draw it out for a couple episodes, for no real reason.  That also sums up this show to a tee—no reasoning.  Everything that happens in this show is merely a convoluted fucking mess and the last two or three episodes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review271997">
        really, really epitomize this.<br />
<br />
Funny enough, even when they were droning on about the three episode cut in the third episode, I thought that this show may have potential and maybe the poor reviews were undeserved.  Goddamn was I wrong.  This shit is a travesty and a blatant try hard at being more complex and meta than it actually is.  Know how to guarantee you have found yourself a conceited piece of shit anime?  They use the word meta in the actual dialogue.... <br />
<br />
Everything about this anime is amplified garbage in the fact that the series starts reasonably enough and slowly devolves into an unfathomable nightmare full of cringe worthy attempts at humor, plot, and &quot;meta&quot; worthy anime....  Each time I thought the score I had given was low enough, I thought more about it, and had to make it lower.  In fact, from the beginning of the last episode until its end, I went from a 5 to a 3.<br />
<br />
Shitty convoluted, try-hard story; bad parody attempts; whiny terrible dub voice acting; and so much more makes the thought of watching this anime ever again make me feel nauseated.<br />
<br />
Animegataris is like an affliction you hope to distance yourself from the second you finish it—if you can manage to do so.

    This anime is really interesting. In my opinion, the parody contained in this anime sometimes makes me guess what the anime is. And also made me know famous anime that I didn&#039;t know about.<br />
<br />
The presentation of the story is different from other anime. The beginning of this anime presents an ordinary club story that is interesting and maybe very very rare in the original world. And I sometimes feel weird myself when watching this anime. Episode 11 is a very sharp turning point. How is it possible from episode 10 that started unusual, changed dramatically in episode 11. Although this episode makes me laugh because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review347917">
        of the strangeness.<br />
<br />
I also like the cast who voices the characters. There are some of my favorite girls. Especially attractive female characters. Also an interesting character design, especially the main character and his classmates.<br />
<br />
Overall, I give this anime a value of 9/10.

    Do you like animes about anime conventions? i do. Why would i give it a 2? because every character is dumb.When i go to anime conventions i don&#039;t say &#039;&#039;i hope i buy some very good stuff,this is a rare one john,wow you are so lucky,the cosplay you ar wearing is so wellmade did you make it by yourself you are so talented lets meet next year&#039;&#039; im not that polite at work, imagine myself with my friends.<br />
<br />
Why everyone is a goodie goodie go lucky loser?<br />
I want cosplay beefs,broken relationships and bad economic decisions. In this show everyone claps for 2 minutes after buying a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308396">
        poster and they full bow when they buy a bottle of water which by the way there is a 4 minute scene about how refreshing is water at summer.DUMB!!!!<br />
<br />
So you have a show about anime conventions, why give it a supernatural spin? so you can just have a talking pet? Which by the way is the only talking pet out there.<br />
<br />
We can disagree, bye my sweetheart papa loves ya &lt;3 all the smooches for you

    Animegataris is an unique anime, that was different from other anime. The first thing that you&#039;ll notice is the title, this anime has the word &quot;anime&quot; in it&#039;s title as well. Animegataris means &quot;Anime Talking&quot;. From this title you can already indicate that this anime is an anime that talks about anime. This is exactly what is is as well. The story is set in an animeclub in a highschool, this club will do all kind of anime related activities like: watching anime, cosplaying, visiting conventions etc. Most of us animefans will totally love the idea of making an anime about being an animefan and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review270295">
        this is also why this anime has been this well received for a while, I write for a while because after a certain episode the animequality all of a sudden goes down.<br />
<br />
As mentioned earlier in the review, Animegataris is an anime about anime. You will often see references of existing anime coming forth disguisted as an alternate title (they can&#039;t really use the real names because that&#039;s not allowed).<br />
<br />
When stepping in the first episode you will notice an interesting story unfolding already, a girl that is no animefan is entering the world of anime because she&#039;s curious about something she&#039;s seen as a child. You see like this how easy it is to influence a person, this is something that happens in real life often as well, it&#039;s like the saying &quot;Monkey see, monkey do&quot;. The characters itself are pretty standard, you have the somewhat clumsy and clueless maincharacter, the rich lady character, the quiet girl character, the energetic girl character, the crazy male character and the &quot;bishounen&quot; male character. Not even one of their personalities is unique and as the story proceeds, only the clumsy and clueless maincharacter has a bit of character development. A major disappoint if you ask me.<br />
<br />
After a while the anime goes down though. I&#039;m not gonna write when exactly because I&#039;m not gonna spoil it, however at some point it&#039;s strongly hinted that this anime was only created so well at first so it wouldn&#039;t get canceled for it&#039;s crazy ending. This is strongly hinted by the characters talking about anime being canceled after their first episode, and they said &quot;I hope we&#039;re not being canceled at episode .. ourselfs&quot;. And trust me when I say, they would totally have been canceled if they would have pulled that crap from episode 1 on. Not only did the ending totally ruin the anime, it was confusing, it was a lackluster, it was random, and totally crazy. While watching it one&#039;s only reaction definitly has to be &quot;What the bloody hell am I watching?...&quot;. This is sad though, because the anime did so well at first and then did this, it&#039;s as if the creators couldn&#039;t care less.<br />
<br />
In the end I gave this anime overall a 5. Animegataris is a fun anime to watch, especially because of the anime theme in it, however do not expect a solid ending that&#039;s enjoyable to watch. The good thing though is that the &quot;fun&quot; stuff to watch is way longer then the crap they added towards it later, with that being said, it&#039;s still worth watching.

If this anime doesn&#039;t want to be serious itself, then why the heck should I be serious with it? I LOLed so hard at the last 3 episodes. So fuckin&#039; hilarious! DON&#039;T TREAT THIS ANIME SERIOUSLY! DON&#039;T! ESPECIALLY NEAR THE END! IT&#039;S JUST MAKING FUN OF ITSELF.<br />
<br />
I rated this an 8/10. It was a fun and enjoyable ride. Never have I thought this anime could give me so much enjoyment. I highly recommend this to those who want REFERENCES, PARODY and an anime that CONSTANTLY MAKE FUN OF ITSELF. At first you can relate to the characters easily, but near the end please just

<br />
&lt;LONG REVIEW, IF YOU EVEN CARE&gt;<br />
<br />
Have you watched Akiba&#039;s Trip The Animation before, if you have, then this is basically the school anime club version of that anime. If you haven&#039;t, then let me introduce you to AnimaGataris, one of the worst anime (if watched seriously) this season. <br />
<br />
Well, AnimeGataris is about a group of anime otaku joined together and formed an anime club in their high school. However, this idea is denied by the student council because of &quot;reason&quot;. Together the members of AnimeGataris fight to get the student council recognition. A very cliche concept indeed. But how they played it out is what made this anime stood out this season, at least for me. <br />
<br />
The story, or &quot;story&quot;, because it&#039;s that irrelevant anyway, is filled with references to other anime series. You can test your anime knowledge through watching this because the amount of references per episode is just WOW! If you can get every reference they made, then congratulation, you have fallen deep into anime hell. If you can&#039;t, then why the heck are you still watching this? Ya, basically what I wanted to say is if you don&#039;t like anime with pure references, just skip this. Also, there are a lot of parodying too, such as parodying Love Live and sports anime. Basically the purpose of this series is just to make fun of the anime industry and community.<br />
<br />
The characters are cliched. None of them stood out to me. But at least I am one who doesn&#039;t mind cliche characters, as long as they are likable and enjoyable, and this anime did it. It packed in a lot of characters that I can relate to and I like, so it&#039;s a plus for me. That&#039;s also what made me continue this anime. <br />
<br />
The art is indeed plain and simple, not to the level of Akiba&#039;s Trip The Animation. However, coming from a studio that made the 10/10 best anime ever, Mars of Destruction, this is a HUGE LEAP in art and animation. So....ya..nothing to complain about.<br />
<br />
I like the OP music. It&#039;s sung by Garnidelia, one of my favorite J-Pop singer. The ED theme is pretty catchy too, not to lie, and how they  included in CG dancing scene there, it maybe a way to cut budget but for an idol trash like me, I like it. None of the BGM stood out, it&#039;s not the point of this anime so whatever. <br />
<br />
Well, overall I do like this series, even though everything is plain. But the comedy really gets to me and I am also one that enjoy anime making fun of itself and the industry. So, if you like these kind of anime then be sure to check out this series.<br />
<br />
 P/S: Please be sure to pack a sufficient amount of anime knowledge before watching this, if not then you won&#039;t get 90% of the jokes told. <br />
<br />
&lt;RANT&gt;<br />
<br />
Episode 10, seriously the staff are high on drugs man! I am speechless. This episode is a mess itself but somehow everything connected at the end. It reminded me of the absurd comedy of Akiba&#039;s Trip The Animation, where the creators are just making fun of themselves. Great job man! I love this episode.  <br />
<br />
Episode 11, the team went insane man! Seriously! This episode is just mocking anime as a whole and I love it. TBH I don&#039;t even want to try to take this anime seriously anymore. Just mindless fun of creators having fun while making the anime. An anime that mocks on anime. Now that&#039;s a pretty rare thing for me. <br />
<br />
Episode 12, speechless. Totally speechless. Way to go anime, way to go. You&#039;ve come a long way. Goodbye and I hope to never see you again.

    Animegataris. It is an anime about otakus, and it is anime FOR otakus. Its biggest appeal is being full of meta references from otaku culture and other anime or genres. You&#039;ll see a lot of references that otakus practice like ship wars, or the famous three episode rule.<br />
<br />
...The anime starts as that. And I loved it when it was only simply that. The anime is full of references from other anime that are just fun to spot, like famous scenes, quotes or characters. Often it&#039;s just enjoyable to see a mention of Ru:Zero, Anosuba, or Guden Daran.<br />
<br />
But as the episode numbers reaches the end, it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266768">
        becomes much, much more. A masterpiece. Well, that might be an exaggeration, but it just really clicked with me perfectly. These creators made a casual anime, broke it into little pieces, embraced the stupidity and created a unique, unafraid, and wonderful ending. This ending is so stupidly enjoyable that it made the anime one of my top favorites of all the anime I&#039;ve watched. But this is just coming from someone who really loves comedy and stupid fun stuff though.<br />
<br />
Sometimes a studio decides to do stupid stuff... and they end up becoming a pile of garbage, like Haruhi&#039;s Endless Eight. And sometimes, a studio decides to create stupid stuff, and do it well, make it something enjoyable, and something that directly speaks to anime fans... And you get Anime-gataris.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t want to spoil much now. But still, no matter how amazing the ending episodes are... Remember that for majority of the anime it is just otaku students enjoying being otakus in their little otaku club. If you dislike that (because it feels somewhat like a slice of life), you might still be interested in the fact that this anime has a lot of otaku meta and references to other anime. If you still somehow dislike that... At least watch the Episode 10 opening because it just shows how much of madmen the creators of this show can be.<br />
<br />
Throughout the regular part of the anime, they play around tropes of other specific genres, like the club-ruining student council in the main description. There are a lot of this in the anime and they made all kinds of references to club anime, ecchi, harems, idol anime, anime-creation anime, slice of life, mechas...<br />
<br />
For the characters, the only really relevant character that has development is the main main character (Minoa), and the creators really wrote her character to the whole anime&#039;s story well, I&#039;d say. The rest of the main characters are pretty bland and one-dimensional but you&#039;re not supposed to find development in them, they&#039;re references to the multiple kinds of otaku that people can relate on; there&#039;s the know-it-all who watches all genres, a guy who&#039;s unashamedly into anime idols, a girl into light novels, a girl into cosplay, an eccentric awkward chuunibyou (hey they exist in real life though otherwise that Chuunibyou anime won&#039;t exist), and, well, the main character is new to anime (who only newbies can relate on and for most of the anime, is mostly a plot device so that the others can explain to her some otaku references). The rest of this whole anime club, as a whole, though, manages to bring her development well and makes a good anchor for the final episodes&#039; storyline.<br />
<br />
The animation... I don&#039;t really particularly care about that (along with the sound). But let me just say this, when they want to reference animation itself, they do it right. All the references about animation, even those that are older ones, are just enjoyable to see.<br />
<br />
Garnidelia&#039;s Aikotoba is the shit, too. It&#039;s upbeat and cheery, and really suits the anime well.<br />
<br />
Finally (somewhat). You see those characters voiced by popular voice actors in the character list? Rie Takahashi, Inori Minase, or Kana Hanazawa herself? All of those are minor characters so don&#039;t expect much. :) Most of the main characters have voice actors that don&#039;t have much listed in their characters voiced list, but they&#039;re not necessarily bad at voice acting though, so don&#039;t worry. Just be disappointed like me that Rie Takahashi&#039;s character is limited to that running gag of mostly being involved in a 5 second fanservice shot, or Kana Hanazawa&#039;s character being the &quot;character of the episode&quot; of one episode.<br />
<br />
Overall... this anime is amazing. I started it because of the character design (and Rie Takahashi). I stayed because of the otaku meta and show refences. I ended with it becoming one of my most favorite anime of all time.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t dismiss it as just another regular high school club comedy slice of life anime. Its main appeal is in the meta references to other shows and the otaku culture. And if you stayed through that... You&#039;ll get an stupidly amazing, unique, and lovable ending, a masterpiece that is created by a bunch of madmen creators who embraced the stupidity and crafted something incredibly enjoyable.<br />
<br />
P.S. Seriously if you decide to drop it somewhere in the middle... At least watch the Episode 10 OP. They took the show&#039;s running gag to the next level.

    So how to describe this anime in one line...<br />
If you dropped it in the first couple of episodes, then YOU DEFINATELY HAVE TO WATCH IT.<br />
<br />
When the show started, after watching the first episode I dropped it right away, since this &#039;otakus are going around doing random otaku stuff&#039; is definately not my cup of a tea. Recently, since I had way too much free time, I randomly checked out episode 12, and boy, I was wrong. After a couple of minutes I decided to give the anime a second chance.<br />
<br />
To be fair the anime does a really good job of disguising itself as &quot;your cringefest

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266455">
        cliche-filled weekly anime&quot; by being exactly that for half of its runtime.<br />
In my opinion episode 1-6 are quite bad:<br />
In the first two episodes they establish the anime club, I guess you are kinda recommended watch it to get to know the characters.<br />
In the next four episodes they are doing random anime related stuff, like going to shops, conventions, etc. You could watch them for all the anime references, but if you find them uninteresting (like me) you may as well skip all of them, they don&#039;t influence the rest of the anime in any way whatsoever.<br />
<br />
The second half of the series, from episode 7, is actually quite good. They start doing something interesting, producing an &quot;anime&quot; (no, not for the rest of the runtime) and finally the show actually starts to be funny, not just cringy. Meanwhile things gradually start to make less sense episode by episode... but in the end everything will make sense. I really liked last couple of episodes, but I won&#039;t spoiler. This is the kind of shows where you have no idea what kind of a ride you got on.<br />
<br />
If you are a man of culture, don&#039;t forget to watch episode 10 opening ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).<br />
There is this girl, Yui, she &quot;belongs to the main cast&quot;, and the anime exclusively uses her as a means of fanservice, and so blatantly, it is funny as hell. (It is the OK kind of fanservice.)<br />
I love animes that don&#039;t take themselves seriously.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m giving the series a score of 7, because for me the first half was quite medicore bad and second part was really good. Overall in the end it was a positive surprise.

    Well I didn&#039;t have high hopes for this anime but I finish this anime laughing during every minute of it. <br />
<br />
This anime made a lot of jokes and as a whole is a parody to the anime industry and it&#039;s fans on how weird it can get, which made me laugh a lot during my time seeing it. Its a weird anime but its pretty funny and the characters are pretty enjoyable and made fun of a lot of anime stereotypes. The best I can say for the art and sound for this anime is that is decent but, looking pass that, you can find

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266821">
        yourself enjoying this anime a lot. <br />
<br />
I recommend you to watch this anime to have some laughs and pass the time. If you know more about the anime industry and stereotypes then thats better to go in and watch it. I have a fun time during it and I hope you do as well. <br />

    I thought this was a pretty good show, so I wanted to go ahead and add a review providing some positive notes and defense of the series. I think it deserves some more attention, and hopefully some of what I mention will help some people who are on the fence about watching it after seeing it&#039;s current rating on this site. I&#039;ll remain vague about some specific aspects, but the review won&#039;t be entirely spoiler free.<br />
<br />
I started watching this show because I am a sucker for series that center around the mediums I like, gaming and Anime. If a show is about characters doing something

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266519">
        that I also do, or can do, like playing card games, board games, video games, or in this instance, watching Anime, then I feel more of a connection with it. It&#039;s something that is replicatable, and makes me feel more involved. While I do tend to find fantastical series more interesting, and what not, there&#039;s nothing wrong with something a little more down to earth. I think that&#039;s why I ended up liking this more than I thought I would. As those two concepts tend to come together at the end, and the line between reality and Anime becomes pretty blurry.<br />
<br />
Starting off with some of the more basic things, I think the OP was one of the best of the entire Winter 2018 season, and even the ED started to grow on me there at the end. It definitely had some nice music. In terms of art and animation, it was okay. Nothing too bad, nothing too good. As long as nothing looks too wonky, that&#039;s fine by me, I generally care more about the content than the appearance.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, the first major thing that drew me in were the various references. I&#039;ve always had a mindset of &quot;what if something was named this, instead of this.&quot; I&#039;ve always considered opening a competing chain of stores with a similar name to something that already exists. Stuff like that is amusing to me. So, seeing various Anime being referenced with a different name is always welcomed, and it&#039;s not as if this series was the first to do that, but it had some good ones. Some of my favorites from this were: Ru:ZERO, Fresh Princess of Tennis, and A Reindeer in August.<br />
<br />
As we progressed, I found the discussion and criticism about Anime to be extremely interesting. I liked how we could use Minoa as an excuse to get a lot of geeky and techincal discussion about Anime. From seeing the characters attend an Anime convention, and talk about the different aspects of fandom, to centering more on the creation of Anime itself. It&#039;s always neat to be able to see a behind of the scenes of how things work. So getting to a point in the series where they attempt to create their own Anime, and we get to see the different processes that go into the completion, from the art, the music, the voice acting, and so on all the way to completion. I enjoyed it more than some of the other series in the past couple years that have attempted to break that process down.<br />
<br />
But, the first thing that really impressed me was the resolution of the problem introduced in Episode 1. I didn&#039;t actually expect them to figure out what the series that Minoa was looking for was. Lately it seems like a lot of these one cour shows don&#039;t allow themselves to end. They reach for another season, yet they don&#039;t get renewed so we get this show that just hangs there with no, or even worse, half a resolution. I actually prefer short stories that give us an ending. Not that epic stories aren&#039;t interesting, and if done right can be phenomenal. However, there&#039;s nothing wrong with embracing a one cour limit, and I believe this series was successful because of that. It definitely wouldn&#039;t work as well as two cour, and hopefully they won&#039;t try to force another season. It&#039;s good as it is.<br />
<br />
In regards to the ending, from the beginning of the series, it sold itself as being self-aware. I also didn&#039;t really expect anything to come out of that, despite getitng some leeway from the audience. In the end, going full on alternate world in the final two episodes was probably the most interesting thing they did in the entire series. I was pretty taken back as things were getting wonky and crazy, and I didn&#039;t expect them to fully embrace it. I thought it was just going to be a disappointing one episode gimmick. Yet, it wasn&#039;t, furthermore; I think it came at the right time in the series and was executed pretty well. It transitions pretty well between thinking Minoa is simply succumbing to chuuni-ism to the realization that more is going on.<br />
<br />
All in all, the series has some nice points to it. There is a lot to be taken away for those who are new or veteran to Anime.

    Animegataris is time capsule anime of our generation similar to that of genshiken or the even older otaku no video.<br />
<br />
What do I mean by a Time capsule anime?<br />
<br />
Basically it is an anime that reference a multitude of other anime while making fun of meta elements of the anime fandom/production.<br />
<br />
<br />
An anime about anime and otakus, for otakus. <br />
<br />
It is something akin to a recap of everything we have come to love or hate over the past years, reflecting the anime fandom&#039;s many cultures.<br />
<br />
On the basis of what this anime is supposed to be, they may have earned a very high 8/10 to a 9/10 as they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266317">
        managed to cover all of the many known shows as well as major otaku events and an amazing amount of meta knowledge.<br />
<br />
As a standalone anime, it earns a 8/10<br />
<br />
It had a lot of twists and turns that only an anime with a lot of references to others and the anime industry itself can make, making it very unique and fresh. Even though there are some parts that may have fallen flat, it was still something that you can take your time with and enjoy. It has enough rules and story elements that makes it work. But there are still unsolved mysteries and loose ends that i&#039;d really want them to tie up, maybe an OVA.<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
<br />
Why 10/10? The reason for that is neither because it&#039;s beautifully drawn nor animated, but because of all the different styles that they were able to cram into this one anime without overwhelming the watchers and making it a spectacle. You get 3DCG, flash tier drawing, super stylized drawing, 80-90s anime style drawing. There is so many of these things that you can pick up on and the amount of time and effort that went into making these twists made it a 10/10.<br />
<br />
sound: 8/10<br />
<br />
The opening and ending, good god it&#039;s amazingly catchy and fun. The osts were very noticeable and were very fitting to the scene. While it&#039;s not a fancy 10/10 it gets the points across as is able to emphasize a scene very well. The feeling of tension, happiness, dread were all able to be conveyed across very well with different osts found in the anime.<br />
<br />
Characters: 10/10<br />
<br />
The characters are distinctive and shows improvement over time as we slowly see. First they started off with only one feature, then slowly expanded over time. Specifically minoa and her character development, fun is an understatement of watching a total anime noob grow into a full blown otaku, she feels ALIVE and absorbing, and remind us anime watchers of what it FEELS like when we were getting into the fandom as well. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
I have watched a lot of anime, I have seen many hidden gems and many mainstream ones, this anime had reference to all of the them and being able to decipher and pick up these different references made it extremely enjoyable to watch. <br />
And then we had the meta jokes, good lord, find me something else to use other than fun and enjoyable because those are enough to portray how i feel when watching this anime. <br />
The twists were somewhat surprising kept us looking forward to more. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s a total blast to watch this anime.<br />
<br />
Overall 9/10:<br />
<br />
My honest opinion is that, if you&#039;ve ever watched anime in your life and find yourself wanting to watch more and learn more about the fandom via anime, or if you&#039;re a hardcore fan with a lot of anime under your belt. You absolutely need to watch this anime, you will gain insight on many things that you may have never seen before, and if you want you will gain the joy of being to pick these things up. It is a blast to watch and a roller coaster of a ride. I wholesomely believe that this anime will most likely serve as an initiator of sorts to the uninitiated and something future watchers will be using as reference when researching about anime. It has a lot of value as a Time capsule anime. And they sure used the genre they are in very well, as  in if this anime isn&#039;t a Time capsule anime, we might not see this level of brilliance. Kudos to those that planned and made this anime, it was truly an amazing gem. Solid 9/10.

    This is surprisingly a really good anime that I would say I enjoyed way more than I was expecting to. The story is out there and characters are not exactly the shows main focus, the sound isn&#039;t anything special (i will say that i really like the opening song personally though) and the art is as usual with most anime, pretty good which is likely why this show has received such a poor rating. However I will say that I really enjoyed the anime, especially the later episodes.<br />

Story: circumstances lead to formation of anime club by mc and a bunch of otaku, student council is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265877">
        for some reason determined to shut down anime club is the starting plot basically. However there is more going on than this.<br />
<br />
art: standard art, everything looks nice, moe 4 lyfe<br />
<br />
sound: the sound is fine, the opening song is really good, nothing amazing during the rest of the show though really.<br />
<br />
characters: most of the characters do not have alot of depth, however they are fairly likeable in their own ways.<br />
<br />
enjoyment: after writing down the last 4 things i&#039;m beginning to wonder why I enjoyed the show so much, yet I did. While I did enjoy the first half of the show initially, I think that it became much better in the second half. like as in someone was making your average club anime and then popped some acid and this happened.<br />
<br />
overall: I gave it a 9/10 because i had a lot of fun watching it and it felt very unique

    I want to be absolutely clear at the start of this review that Animegataris is not actually a 10/10 show.  Rather, I scored it a 10/10 purely out of respect for being the first show I have watched that completely transcends the question of being &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; and instead exists on its own plane of psychedelic insanity.  The series begins as a lighthearted school comedy and ultimately descends completely into surrealism for the last few episodes, blurring the lines between reality and anime, and between the characters in the show and the viewer.  When you finish, the first thought that will

          <span style="display: none;" id="review382941">
        cross your mind is &quot;well, that sure was something.&quot;  It&#039;s the only appropriate reaction to this series.

    Animegataris is a story about anime in the literal sense of the word, it is an interesting take in how a comunity or a club of anime fans can behave and conduct themselves in a way that can let them share the things they enjoy the most and although it isn&#039;t the best try at the take of anime in a show it is still deserving of being watched.<br />
<br />
The story centers around a girl called Asagaya, Minoa who becomes an anime rookie and makes an anime club along with Kamiigusa Arisu, Kouenji Miko, Mushasisakai Kai and Aoyama Erika. They face the difficulties of having a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300730">
        club and especially one dedicated to something as attention seeker as anime, they have the experience they haven&#039;t had yet and truly do their best to make the anime club something worth remembering.<br />
<br />
It has some flaws that Derailed the quality of the series and that prevented it from fully reaching it&#039;s potential. The lack of romance isn&#039;t something necessarily bad but the way they managed some characters and how they got in certain incidents that made the series have some unnecesary fanservice really derailed the experience, this series isn&#039;t an ecchi so i didn&#039;t really saw the point of having fanservice in it because it didn&#039;t made sense in the story. <br />
<br />
The music could have been better mainly because they weren&#039;t creative enough and the show could have had some of the most creative and funny music of any anime mainly because of the story presented in it.<br />
<br />
The art was nice, i liked the character&#039;s design and especially the desig of minoa was cute and thoughtful. The animation was solid through the entire run of the series, it had some episodes better animated than others but overall it was solid having no real downsides. The use of colours and a vast variety of them gave the series a colourful essence that made it able to have a warm atmosphere.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed it but didn&#039;t found it memorable and didn&#039;t thought about it more than two seconds after finishing it, it was a nice but not so accurate attempt of depicting the duty of an anime club and it&#039;s different misadventures.

    This Anime was great at first. Cool characters, fun references, great music.<br />
It was just a bunch of Otakus doing Otaku stuff. <br />
<br />
Then we get into the whole &quot;anime is becoming real in the real world&quot; episodes. Did they run out of ideas so they changed the series completely? <br />
<br />
They also made the student council so unlikeable it made the story even more annoying...<br />
<br />
<br />
I have mixed feelings at this point...<br />
Regarding the voice acting, you could tell most of them tried their best. <br />
The animation is clean and some of the characters are unique.<br />
<br />
Overall I don&#039;t recommend watching the anime for the story, you would be better

    If you enjoy catching references to other anime within anime, this show has got you more than covered. If you don&#039;t really care about doing that, this show really doesn&#039;t give much of anything to you, except some funny scenes and random fanservice.<br />
<br />
Obviously, it&#039;s written for people who are already anime otaku, about a group of anime otaku. At first, I thought it was kind of fun, and the characters were relatable and somewhat entertaining. But the farther I watched, the more ridiculous they got, showing the more extreme kinds of otaku; sort of the kind of people you would not want to actually talk

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265267">
        to because they don&#039;t know how to talk about anything except anime.<br />
<br />
The story is a basic club anime plot, with some scenes thrown in (people&#039;s reaction to their cultural festival event) that were unrealistic enough that it just annoyed me. The characters are entertaining, but their personalities are incredibly one-dimensional and don&#039;t progress or grow at all. Everything that happens is predictable enough that there&#039;s absolutely 0 suspense factor, even suspense that do /know/ what&#039;s going to happen. Most club anime, you know things will work out, but it&#039;s written in a way that you think, maybe, things really might not work out, which makes them more entertaining to watch. Anime-gataris does not do that. You know exactly what&#039;s going to happen at any given time in the show. The one thing I was interested in finding out more about even turned out to be nothing even remotely interesting, nor did it really make any sense at all.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is OK. It&#039;s certainly not bad, and I like the ED song, but it&#039;s not the kind of stuff I&#039;d go look up on youtube to listen to after the show ends. About the same goes for the animation, though that&#039;s lower quality than the sound is. <br />
<br />
I assume they didn&#039;t have the biggest budget/time allotment for episodes of this. The character art is a bit inconsistent, but faaar from the worst I&#039;ve seen. What really bothers me more than inconsistency and static-ness is the lip sync. Yes, most anime will have a lot of &quot;lip syncing&quot; that&#039;s just the mouth opening and closing as if the person&#039;s saying &quot;ah ah ah ah&quot; the whole time. But most anime don&#039;t put focus on the mouths as if the sync animation is amazing when they do that. The whole ED video focuses on lip syncing, even though they didn&#039;t make the syncing look decent. There&#039;s also a, like, 30 second or so fanservice clip where you see nothing but the girl&#039;s mouth moving but it&#039;s just doing that Ah Ah Ah Ah thing. I wouldn&#039;t mind it if they didn&#039;t try to make it seem like it was good animation even though it isn&#039;t, but boy, they sure do.<br />
<br />
Overall, my feelings towards this show are just that it&#039;s decent. Fun to watch if you&#039;re bored, but don&#039;t expect anything more than that. There&#039;s a chance you might get attached to like, one character, like myself and some other people I know did, but really none of them are actually interesting, just cute at times. Which is about how the whole series is.
