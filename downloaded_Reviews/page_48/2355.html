    For a long time, people have argued whether originality truly plays a role into the quality of a title. In any media where there is an audience and a profit to be made, it&#039;s natural for many writers and artists to take inspiration from a tried and true formula. Though they may take steps to break from the circle of homogeneity and establish their own identity, deriving elements from other successful titles is inevitable.<br />

        and her friends Sawa and Konatsu. Immediately after receiving a scolding from the strict vice principal, Konatsu decides to quit the choir club and start a new one by herself with the aid of her friends, as well as the later addition of two male characters: Taichi, a diligent badminton player, and &quot;Wien&quot;, a peculiar transfer student from Austria. Of course, things don&#039;t go as smoothly for Konatsu as she was hoping they would, receiving an initially hostile reaction from Wakana who accuses her of fooling around and treating music as a game. In an attempt to show overcome her stress, Konatsu sings outdoors in public and gathers the attention of her aforementioned friends - finally assembling enough members to establish the club and push forward with her ambitions. <br />
<br />
On the surface, Tari Tari seems like a standard coming of age story with a musical focus. Though the music remains a principal aspect of the anime, it primarily serves as the catalyst to bring the characters together and force them to overcome their own individual issues. For Wakana, these issues involve the regret surrounding her deceased mother, an accomplished musician who taught her how to sing and play piano. For Sawa, it involves her equestrian passions and love for horseback riding, much to the disagreement and discord with her parents. For Taichi it follows his ambition for badminton, while for Wien it is about his desire to preserve justice. <br />
<br />
While the series is focused on teenage drama, what it excels at is making each character&#039;s issue relevant and believable by using the strengths and weaknesses of the characters to evoke emotion from the viewer, instead of relying on the tired routine of melodrama. Much of the episodes focus on Wakana&#039;s previous passion for music, with her past and the relationship between her mother being explored as her story arc progresses. Her avoidance of music is given explanation and reason, while the revival of her passion feels meaningful as she comes to terms with the past and begins to see things in a new, positive light. Each question is answered and each issue is resolved, while new ones are carefully set to take their place and give reason for the viewer to be interested in subsequent episodes. A frequent problem with teenage drama in fiction has always been the reliance on trite dialogue and melodrama instead of a coherent narrative, but Tari Tari manages to feel realistic while capturing the important stage in one&#039;s life between adolescence and adulthood. The 13 episodes here have been used in a highly productive fashion which succeeds in giving each character substance. <br />
<br />
Sadly, the same amount of detail and depth isn&#039;t given to all of the characters. Taichi in particular receives very little growth over the course of the series, resulting in his own passions and issues being seldom explored. Aside from filling the necessary role as the fifth member of the club, Taichi ultimately adds very little to the story aside from developing a romantic interest in Sawa that is only vaguely hinted towards. Other issues in the characterization come from Wien&#039;s backstory and story arc, and while he&#039;s given sufficient character development in the later episodes, the resolution is surprisingly trivial given the amount of foreshadowing earlier in the series. His childish desire to defend justice is sympathetic but the lack of consistency obstructs his story arc from wrapping up in a satisfying manner. It&#039;s fortunate that Wien himself is a unique and exciting character, being an amusing transfer student that frequently misuses and exaggerates Japanese gestures, often with comedic results. It&#039;s hard not to grow attached to him over the course of the series. <br />
<br />
Another common element in Tari Tari is the presence of an antagonist: the vice principal, who strongly opposes the club for what she perceives as them simply fooling around. As with most stories, she&#039;s initially portrayed as being cold and unlikeable to build up conflict, though remarkably her character is given just as much growth and backstory as any of the main cast. By the end of the story, her cold behavior makes full sense and she herself learns to overcome her past issues as a result of another character&#039;s own growth. Rather than simply serving as a plot device, the vice principal develops into a realistic and believable as well, which makes her cooperation with the main characters during the final episode all the more significant and meaningful. <br />
<br />
Being that Tari Tari is an anime focused on music, it&#039;s a bit disappointing that the quality of the music itself is nothing outstanding or noteworthy. The background music is rarely noticeable and the songs that the characters perform are all fairly juvenile and amateur, though the emotionally-driven &quot;Kokoro no Senritsu&quot; is a great addition to the soundtrack. The climactic song performed in the final episode is also well-executed, having full instrumentation to back it up and give it a more professional approach. A clever trick is also used during the ending track, with Wakana pensively sitting apart from the rest of the main cast until her passion for music is revived in the later episodes.<br />
<br />
Though not visually superb, Tari Tari benefits from its complex and detailed scenery which is based and modeled upon real locations. The school and the area in which the characters all live in feels very much authentic and distinctive, with impressive lighting and many dynamic camera tricks used to further accentuate the scenery. Many titles involve a high school setting but Tari Tari is one of the few that effectively build the school environment. For an anime that focuses on realistic characters, a realistic depiction of the setting is paramount, and luckily this important detail is not forgotten. The end result is an anime that looks and feels polished, with very few off-model scenes. <br />
<br />
Tari Tari is a title that stands out not for its setting, nor its story, or even its well-developed characters. What sets it apart from the multitude of other similar titles is how it manages to synthesize all of these elements and convey a story with eloquence and reason. It exemplifies exactly how teenage drama should be conducted in a story. When so many series subscribe to the notion of &quot;the more crying and yelling, the better&quot;, a title such as this is a breath of fresh air and proof of how effective this genre can be when executed efficiently. It certainly has its share of mis-steps and doesn&#039;t achieve excellence in any one aspect, but it would be hard not to recommend Tari Tari as a solid title and one of the more noteworthy in recent times. Why not cast aside the preconceptions and enjoy the ride?

    The drama based on the school club is about as tried and true of an anime theme as giant robots and beach episodes.  In that case, Tari Tari certainly doesn’t break any new ground.  It doesn’t particularly do anything amazingly well or put a new spin on the genre or feature memorable characters or scenes that will stand the test of time.  But despite it all, it managed to still be a fun, fully enjoyable, and worthy investment of my time.<br />
<br />
Tari Tari revolves around a group of five high schooler&#039;s who even though they all have very different goals in life do

          <span style="display: none;" id="review73295">
        share a common interest, music.  Singing, in particular.  They all find themselves in a newly formed club to sing together, for the joy of singing, and not under the structured rules of the other related clubs.  As expected we have plenty of drama and squabbling with the power that be as they try to crush our little upstarts at every chance.  But despite the clichéd sounding themes of the main plot it does manage to deliver an overall story that is pretty well rounded and within the realm of reality. <br />
<br />
Probably what Tari Tari does best is give us five believable protagonists who all struggle with their own problems, mostly typical of your average teenager on the cusp of adulthood.  They have realistic and achievable dreams and goals that I think the average viewer can relate to, unlike many of the fantastical settings most anime are based in.  Not to say this is a bad thing in all cases, I just think that it’s refreshing now and then to have more down to earth characters.  The storylines featuring Wakana and Sawa were clearly the highlight of the series, and even though some of the smaller subplots weren’t really adequately wrapped up I found myself with little to complain about overall.<br />
<br />
Because it doesn’t allow itself to get buried underneath a girth of over exposed side characters, Tari Tari&#039;s cast really shines.  I would challenge anyone to find even one of the main cast that they couldn&#039;t like.  Even though the show does not really have any one character in which the story is told through, the majority is seen, not unexpectedly through our three female leads.  Mostly because of the strength of their own personal arcs, Wakana and Sawa really stand out from the rest.  In particular I found myself drawn to Wakana who has the most heart-wrenching back-story.  The whole dead parent plot device has been done to death but I felt her story was very moving and powerful.<br />
<br />
Of the series antagonists and side characters really only stands out, the vocal club advisor and Vice Principal Naoko Takakura.  While she is at first glance just you’re run of the mill constipated anime bitch, she has a humanity about her that makes you feel for her.  Too be honest I felt her story was just as interesting as any of the main characters, perhaps because it was also tied to Wakana&#039;s story.<br />
<br />
The vocal cast features a good mix of seiyuu veterans and newcomers.   While I enjoy hearing some new voices,  it’s always nice to hear a couple of my favorites such as Saori Hayami and Ayahi Takagaki and a great deal of my overall enjoyment of Wakana’s and Sawa&#039;s characters was due to their performances.  As a show about music you would also expect a great deal of songs, which there are.   Most of these are performed by the cast.  The ED theme in particular was my favorite and never found myself growing tired of it.  The OP, sung by AiRI is a veteran of many other anime/game projects people are likely to be familiar with but this was best song I have heard from her yet.<br />
<br />
I loved all the character designs for the main cast, as they all had believable body types and mostly looked their ages.  Konatsu looked a tad young but a pretty minor complaint.  The backgrounds and settings were gorgeous; however some of the animation looked a little stiff and awkward (Such as Konatsu&#039;s running).  Some of the adult characters looked pretty strange and unappealing to me as well, particularly the adult characters that all had some really creepy looking lips.  It&#039;s just a style that generally does not appeal to me.<br />
<br />
So despite my high rating of Tari Tari is it a really amazing anime?  No it isn&#039;t.  But it is very good.  In a year that really hasn’t featured a lot of really great shows, Tari Tari stands out as one of the years&#039; better ones.  If you’re in the mood for light hearted school drama, you should find plenty to enjoy with this one.<br />

    At first look, Tari Tari seems to be one of those animes that completely focuses on School life, that applies comedy in certain areas, with a cultural festival to wrap everything up or something. <br />
But I was wrong Tari Tari is one of those animes where it focuses heavily on the drama of each main character, with slight comical scenes and is also a slice of life. For people who compare this to K-ON there stupid, there a completely different genre, K-ON is more comedy oriented while Tari Tari is more drama. Just because they both have music involved there not the same, you wont

          <span style="display: none;" id="review68855">
        exactly call Code Geass similar to any of the Gundam anime just because they have mecha in....<br />
<br />
Story 8<br />
<br />
The story is 5 high school kids forming the choir club due to the main character Konatsu unable to &quot;Shine&quot; in the music club. The main story involves around each of the main characters story providing a very nice slice of life drama that involves the characters family, individual problems or simply just friends hanging out and having fun. Although there is another main story that involves the choir club&#039;s activity and their fight against the schools music club or something along those lines. But really its just jealously.<br />
<br />
Art 8<br />
<br />
Tari Tari is very well animated, the animation is fairly modern and is very similar to Hanasaku Iroha for those familiar with that anime.  Each character design is done fairly well and is realistic unlike some animes that provide a simple sketch with not a lot of detailed. I especially like Konatsu character design, i find it pretty cool and modern especially the bits when she has her headphones on. I know for a fact to many people comment on the size of Sawa&#039;s tits, its big but for some reason everyone keeps commenting some very &quot;disturbing comments&quot; about them. The background is pretty well animated, its to be expected from an anime that came out in 2012.<br />
<br />
Sound 9<br />
<br />
The concept of Music was quite special in this anime, the music and sound itself was part of the Story rather than just trying to make scenes better. The OST is quite well done, they use the song&#039;s which the character made as OST which is pretty cool. Also the ending song video changes when each character situation changes, not a lot of anime&#039;s does this although its only minor changes.<br />
<br />
Character 9<br />
<br />
Each character have their own difficulties whether its family problems or problems associated with their dreams. Each of the character story is detailed to the point where it is rare to find bits undeveloped and it often gives you a heart warming feeling/tear jerking moment once it ended, making you think &quot; Ah that was unexpected but i&#039;m happy for them&quot;. The personality of each character also often provides some drama, Wakana&#039;s personality for one, often causes quite a lot of drama/difficulties at the start of the anime when she wasn&#039;t close with everyone. But it gets better as it progresses.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9<br />
<br />
Tari Tari was one of those few animes that have actually made me laughed and cried, the other anime that made me do that was Clannad. While this anime focuses on slice of life drama, its comical moments are pretty good especially the ones focus around messing with Maeda, ah you can&#039;t but laugh at how gullible he is =P or his &quot;vocal training&quot; with Taichi. Or there market ranger cosplay, Konatsu&#039;s &quot;Curry punch!&quot; =P.<br />
<br />
Overall 9<br />
<br />
Overall Tari Tari pretty much has everything you can ask for from a slice of life anime, from drama to comedy. If your one of those viewers that want something with modern animation, great sound and a amazing story that doesn&#039;t make you want to pull your hair out at every plot twist then Tari Tari is definitely something for you. It is quite possibly one of the top 3 best animes in this current season alongside Sword art online and Kokoro Connect. (For readers who might say &quot;Hyouka is better!&quot; Hyouka was last season not this season!)

    It is said that music soothes the soul. There is always at least one song that can send shivers down our spine and play games with our fragile hearts; it can be interpreted in various ways depending on the individual. The way music plays our heartstrings can be beautiful and majestic, yet also painstakingly depressing. It tickles our souls nonetheless. <br />
<br />
The story of Tari Tari is best described as arc based plots. While overall the story is very enjoyable, I also believe it takes a very safe approach with regards to adhering to common tropes rather than striving for the something new and interesting. This

          <span style="display: none;" id="review122169">
        isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing considering that the story is presented in a satisfying, coherent fashion, but playing it safe also creates a lack of remembrance. While the show revolves around the choir (and sometimes badminton) club, there are also many issues addressed outside of the club that the audience can relate to.<br />
<br />
One of the strongest qualities that Tari Tari has is that it doesn’t try to be something it’s not. It’s not a part of the romance genre and it strictly stays that way. It also doesn’t utilize fan service as a cheap gimmick to attract an audience because that isn&#039;t what the series is about. Despite appearances of being a run-of-the-mill moe slice of life, Tari Tari grasps strong themes and articulates them pleasantly. It’s a heartfelt story about coming of age and dealing with the struggles of life.<br />
<br />
The art and animation for Tari Tari are nothing too exceptional, but still good in my opinion. I really enjoy the quality that P.A. Works brings to the table, and I&#039;ve enjoyed many other works by them. From the characters to the setting, and the animation itself, Tari Tari is visually pleasing.<br />
<br />
The sound portion of Tari Tari caused me a slight bit of confusion. Given that the series is of the musical genre, I figured there would be more music involved in the sense of frequency versus actual quality. Instead what I got was quite a bit of the opposite, which I was perfectly content with. While there is a feeling of a lack of musical performances, Tari Tari&#039;s quality of music was exceptional. <br />
<br />
Something unusual, yet intriguing about Tari Tari is the lack of a real main character. It&#039;s not required for a series to necessarily have a main character, however, in this case, the lack of one causes a slight impairment to the series. Supposedly the main characters are the members of the choir (and sometimes badminton) club, but realistically the differences in amount of character development is drastic. Wakana&#039;s story arc expands throughout nearly the whole series, whereas the other characters get substantially less time to develop. While the characters themselves are entertaining and likable, with Wien as a notable mention, it&#039;s a bit of a shame that they don&#039;t get much of their own story. On the contrary, side characters such as the principle and vice-principle get a bit of unexpected character development as well. There is a sense of realism depicted by the characters of Tari Tari; they each have charm, individual problems and aspirations, strengths, and weaknesses. It makes them a likable bunch.<br />
<br />
With all things said and done, I thought Tari Tari was nothing short of impressive. It was remarkably refreshing to watch a series that doesn&#039;t capitalize on fan service (of the sexual manner). Hopefully more anime in the near future will keep an open mind and adapt this mindset. Sadly, I doubt it. <br />
<br />
The beauty of music is that there is no good or bad, better or worse. Each and every song is just right for someone out there; it just may take a while for the right person to listen. While Tari Tari doesn&#039;t perfectly hit all the right notes, it certainly stirs the melody of the heart. If you enjoy slice of life with a dash of drama and music, Tari Tari just might be the right song for you.

    High school. Ya, we&#039;ve all been there (or at least most people have). Some people likes it, some people are indifferent about it, and some people hates it with a passion. The times we spent at high school may be a different experience for everyone but it is because of these experiences that we learn more about friendship, life, and most importantly, about ourselves. This series explores the life of what a final year  of high school in the minds of several friends in the “Choir and sometimes Badminton Club” as they prepare their journey of their adulthood and into the future.  <br />

Tari

          <span style="display: none;" id="review73115">
        Tari is one of those unexpected series of the season. In one way, there&#039;s not much action or excitement watching a bunch of cute girls doing cute things. In another way, it&#039;s a lighthearted school drama that details a story driven by friendship between a group of students who have their dreams, goals, ambitions, and mostly importantly, each other. That&#039;s right, Tari Tari is the rare gem of this season and one you can&#039;t buy into your heads without embracing its styles and themes that brings to its viewers.<br />
<br />
The series is relatively new that is adapted from the manga written by Evergreen. Tari Tari is tagged with music, slice of life, as well as school life so guess what, the series takes place at a school setting. Some of you might feel less enthusiastic about a series regarding to school life. After all, we got  like a million of those already and who needs more. Yet, Tari Tari here presents a sweet tale of music melancholy that has a charming cast and a refreshing drama that is memorable.<br />
<br />
There are five main characters in the series that all debuts in its pilot episode. Count them with a hand. Five characters and all of them have identical shaped heads but different personalities. <br />
<br />
First up, we got Wakana Sakai. She is what I would call the stubborn young lady. Despite having a strong voice with real talent, she refuses to sing. However, after certain circumstances, Wakana learns more about the true values of family and dedicates herself for the mother that she loves so dearly. Then, we got Sawa Okita who wishes to turn her dream of becoming a professional jockey into a reality. She&#039;s what I can see as probably the Yamato Nadeshiko of the club. Yet, below that outer shell hides an intensity that has vibes which can invoke much drama. Finally, we got Konatsu Miyamoto who makes up the balance of the group and seems to be the cheerful type of girl who likes to get involved with others but truly wants to help her friends. These three girls here all spice things up in the series with their conflicting personalities and ideologies.<br />
<br />
The boys in the series are also noticeable at different stances. They won&#039;t let the girls walk all over them especially Taichi Tanaka who wishes to expand his badminton club. He is on a level of stubbornness with Wakana but deep down has a kind heart. His best friend, Atsuhiro &quot;Wien&quot; Maeda is there for him even though the duo has nearly completely opposite personalities. <br />
<br />
So, here we are, the Choir and Sometimes Badminton Club. It&#039;s hard to say who is the leader as all of them have different parts in the story. They all have their dreams whether becoming a jockey, a professional tennis player, or finishing a song for a person they love. It&#039;s like high school you know, especially during the senior year when you start wondering about your future. <br />
<br />
The series&#039; episodes sometimes shifts focus and maintains on a specific character of the club. Yet, it brings out a sense of realistic feeling that we can relate. Tari Tari is a series that is character driven and all the members of the Choir and Sometimes Badminton Club gets their chance to shine whether individually or as a whole. The circumstances that leaves some of these characters as who they are is also entertaining to watch. Weird huh? Slice of life series often seems like reading a book where we watch a characters&#039; life develop and their every day circumstances. Yet here, Tari Tari presents some sense of entertainment that allows us to taste a bit of realism of what the final year of high school feels like. (even for those who&#039;s already been there)<br />
<br />
P.A Works (Angel Beats!, True Tears, Hanasaku Iroha) is involved in the series. Thus, you can expect some similarities if you&#039;re familiar with the studio. Hanasaku Iroha is especially the case here considering the various similarities and that slice of life nostologia. The visuals of the series is also similar that brings simple school life artwork to life. Some of the episodes are deeply colored but overall retains that simple yet realistic image that gives off the slice of life feeling. There are times some childish yet cute animation sequences with miniature version of some of the characters. Overall though, the artwork visuals are above average.<br />
<br />
The overall soundtrack coordination and music in the series brings out a general lighthearted melody in the series. Jin Aketagawa (Hatsukoi Limited, Honey and Clover, Toradora!) presents his skills into  Tari Tari with his experiences involving school life melancholy. The OP song &quot;Dreamer&quot; by AiRI is a symbolic term that reflects what people can do when they try hard and with the help of their friends, can make dreams come true. The ED songs here though are much more interesting to look at. In the first few sequences, there&#039;s not much development with only a lonely girl (Konatsu). As the episodes progresses and as the club grows, the ED songs features more ensembles with the cast. <br />
<br />
The fact that the series is also tagged as “music”, you can expect some talented tunes beating into your ears. Unfortunately from my respective, I can&#039;t really agree with such a real talent coming out the mouths of the characters. It&#039;s just fairly average but with their ambitions, the club can make it quite far. Later on though, they bring more amusement into the show and their inner hero awakens within them bringing forth more drama. Speaking of which, there is definitely drama in the series despite not being explicit detailed. Drama takes place into the eyes of the vice principal who has a grudging attitude. It reminds me of this guy I met during high school. He would berate students for the tiniest of mistakes and hands out detention slips like free samples at Costco. Yet, as the series progresses, we can see some reflection of the vice principal&#039;s past and what she&#039;s been through. Although not the most likable character in the series, it&#039;s interesting to see her development involving the members of the cast.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, this series is a rare gem of this season that takes slice of life to a different level. It is a school drama with a likeable cast of characters of different personalities. They bring forth joy, entertainment, drama, but at times also emotions that we all feel as part of being human. The series artwork has realism and is natural like the way a high school experience should be. The soundtrack orchestrated fits within the lighthearted mood of a typical slice of life series. The story itself focuses on the individual characters as well as the Choir and Sometimes Badminton Club as a whole. It&#039;s dramatic and entertaining to watch even though. Still though, don&#039;t expect much surprise as the series does follow with some cliches and can be repetitive at times. Additionally, the series has many borrowed themes from other school life series so don&#039;t expect the unexpected.<br />
<br />
So, what do you think? Still want to watch Tari Tari? I know high school has a different view in the minds of different people but it&#039;s an experience that most of us have or will explore in our lives. During that final year, it&#039;s time to think about the future and with friends as well as a strong ambition, there&#039;s nothing we can&#039;t accomplish.<br />

    All right.......so far, this is my first review, and hopefully not the last. I&#039;m sure a few people would know my name, but that doesn&#039;t matter. As someone who watches over 8 or 10 of the anime series per season, along with other anime/manga stuff, I&#039;m busy. But I believe this series deserves my first critic.<br />
<br />
I had good, if not the up most, expectations for Tari Tari, and it seems to have answered it with just the first episode. I&#039;m sure there will be more to come, but I believe the first episode has done a magnificent job. So far, the story (for me) is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review65287">
        interesting, the art is smooth, the music in very entertaining, and other elements caught my attention. I might edit this review later on, but for now this is my opinion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
9/10<br />
At first, like some other folks, I believed this story was going to be another &quot;a circle of friendly girls&quot; type of anime series, which there seems to be a good number of them in the last few seasons. But, since it isn&#039;t, I was thankful.<br />
<br />
The plot seems to revolve around not just one, but around a group of students of five, all with different interests. Though it may seem that one girl, Konatsu, is at the center due to her being the one trying to assemble the Music club in the anime, I believe she isn&#039;t really. I also thought that Wakana was at the center also when I saw the first 5 minutes. But because of how the plot is assembled and presented, I feel that it revolves around not just the two, but also horseback rider Sawa, lonely Badminton player Taichi and transfer student Wien.<br />
<br />
Fascinating and eye-catching, the story is somewhat different yet similar to the usual high school anime series I&#039;ve watched. The idea of creating a new club is technically a reused plot, but the characters introduced to fill into this plot really made it interesting. I look forward to how it&#039;ll be in the future.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation:<br />
8/10<br />
Though it may not be at the level of &quot;scenery porn&quot; (check here http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn), the background, character details and other visual elements made me feel comfortable with the series. Smooth-flowing, though I believe I&#039;m not one who ever tries to negatively critic art, I&#039;m sure I cannot say that I know what is truly good anime art and what is not. Still, the animation here has that comfortable grasp, as I&#039;ve seen this art style in many of PA Works anime.<br />
<br />
Music:<br />
9/10<br />
For such a humble anime series, the music fit quite well. The OP and the animation that went with it made the anime series more attractive, while the ED drew me in, telling me to watch the next episode. The sound effects and soundtracks were ear-catching, and lovable. I&#039;m pretty sure those good songs and BGMs were chosen as it seems this series has music close to its core. Konatsu and Taichi sang quite well, and I&#039;m looking forward to the rest of the cast singing too.<br />
<br />
Oh, not to forget, the use of &quot;Reflectia&quot; for the chorus in the first episode really made a good impression on the anime. I applaud for that specifically.<br />
<br />
Cast/character:<br />
9/10<br />
Each character is memorable and also the kind of people I would like to associate with. As said before, I believe there is five &quot;main&quot; characters, and no one is truly the main focus.<br />
<br />
Konatsu: A cheerful and upbeat girl who loves music. It seems to be that many recognize her by her &quot;blonde&quot; hair, though I would like to say that it is more of a light brown color. But that aside, her physical character design fits well with her personality. Her VA did well with the singing also, which I liked.<br />
<br />
Sawa: A more mature girl who is friends to Konatsu. A horseback rider at home, she also participates in a club at school. I yet again feel the character design fits the personality, but I do have to say the VA choice was close to perfect.<br />
<br />
Wakana: A girl with a mysterious past. It seems to be that she&#039;s hard to approach...this character is my favorite in the series, and that&#039;s possibly because I love the character design, plus the personality she presents to the audience. Her VA choice was also a perfect one.<br />
<br />
Wien: A transfer student from Austria. This character&#039;s background is not dug up much in the first episode, though I do have to say he over-studied the Japanese culture. I&#039;m quite fond of his personality and character designs, being the usual brown-haired nice guy. When I looked into his VA, I was stunned at how well his VA did for his first voice acting role. He&#039;s a promising VA, but nonetheless....<br />
<br />
Taichi: Badminton player. Again, no much is covered about him in the first episode, but I do know that he has this loyal and prideful personality. His kind of character is a somewhat necessary fit into our current cast, so I&#039;m appreciate that his character is in the series. Va, yet again, did a good job portraying his character.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
9/10<br />
Lots is to be expected of this series, if not infinitely. I am sure there are some who will agree with my review, and so who won&#039;t, but I invite all of you to at least try and take a good watch at the first episode at least. Thank you.

    There was a time when children watched decent American cartoons and Japanese anime on TV. Then around 10 years ago, at least in Germany, the quality of the shown material worsened rapidly. Animes were cut out of the program nearly completely, most of American and European productions lost all value, and so my time in front of the TV mostly ended. I am so content now that there are other ways to watch anime and I don&#039;t have to miss heartwarming anime shows like this one, Tari Tari.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did I come from, and where on Earth am I heading?&quot;<br />
So then, what is there to expect?...

          <span style="display: none;" id="review118349">
        actually a bunch of high schoolers who search for a way to graduate properly and to live on after. For Sawa and Wakana, it is a struggle because they have to face tragedies or objections within their families, and for Konatsu it is a fight to overcome an embarrassing past experience. The story shows their efforts to bear with these burdens and how to remember their high school time: through the passion of music. Together with Badminton-fanatic Taichi and the peculiar Austrian student &quot;Wien&quot; they form the (not only, but most of the time) Choir Club and begin to understand what it means to live for something.<br />
<br />
The story is kind of slow-paced, but has a clear goal and gets you hooked up especially during the last episodes. The music theme is transported throughout the series, though I would have liked to see more choir performances. The ones you will see, however, are quite a pleasure to hear to, notably &quot;Melody of the Heart&quot;, which gave me shivers at the end of episode 2.<br />
<br />
Character-wise I cannot think of anyone who I despise for being there. They all have a personality that interacts well with the flow of time, and also the &quot;antagonists&quot; get a decent grip in the whole picture for a 13-episode-SoL-show. Character development is mainly focused on the female characters, for they overcome their burdens and Konatsu in particular develops a firm mind to carry the choir towards their mutual goal.<br />
<br />
Animation and art serve their purpose: The characters look natural and move accordingly. Backgrounds are vivid enough to differentiate, and there are no flaws in landscape or the school, from which I love the view over the sea and the architecture. Voice acting and background music are done without complaints, but aren&#039;t special either.<br />
<br />
So then, before I drift away into stating mere facts and make the review unnecessarily long, I would like to mention my final thought. For a Slice of Life anime, a certain vibe is essential to carry the sometimes trivial messages. Tari Tari stays true to its melancholic and friendly touch and shows us another time how purposefulness and friendship can conquer personal and even greater problems. Together with moments worth remembering like the stage performances, what can YOU make wrong in deciding to give this show a real chance? I enjoyed it all the way through ...

    Tari Tari is truly a beautiful anime, simple music and subtle emotions, blending into what we known as Tari Tari. I love the music that’s played, the voices are wonderful and it never ceases to amaze me with every episode.<br />
<br />
 I don’t think it’s fair to compare it to K-ON, even though they share the same premise, music and art seem a little similar but both are portrayed differently. <br />
<br />
The characters are not the typical or stereotypical character complexes of the anime world; they are far more complex, harbouring emotions that run thicker as each episode is aired. I love the characters and the interactions,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review68997">
        it’s lovely and a change of pace from what I usually watch.<br />
<br />
It’s calming, relaxing with the tranquil music that instantly drew me in, both the OP and the ED are captivating. The drama is another aspect that appeals to the viewer, slowly building in and well developed.  <br />
As for those who simply call it boring, actually watch a few episodes and see the development for your selves, nothing over bearing with the drama but very easily to connect to.<br />
<br />
Overall it was a warming, tender and peaceful anime. Good music and flawless characters, I’d be enjoying every moment of this anime and sad to see it end but neverless, I hope it continues with the standards that they’ve upholded so far.<br />
<br />
Give it a few episodes rather than just the one to appreciate the anime for what it’s worth, the music, drama and characters are combined into this work of art.<br />

    I feel the need to review this since it has such a low popularity rating on MAL and it doesn&#039;t recieve too much attention. This anime is very underrated, and I hope this review will help others discover this anime and give it a chance.<br />
<br />
Story: The premise of the anime is simple, a group of friends start a choir club and unintentionally/implicitly compete against the schools chorus club who&#039;s sponsor is the vice principal who&#039;s an alleged **** The anime&#039;s plot is so simple and it&#039;s nothing to write home about, but it&#039;s so enjoyable for it&#039;s simplicity. The anime slowly unravels and develops each

          <span style="display: none;" id="review97265">
        character and this may be a slight tear-jerker. 7/10<br />
<br />
Art: The animation is great, though character design may seem blandish, the characters WILL grow on you. The backgrounds make the anime&#039;s world seem very immersive and realistic 8/10<br />
<br />
Sound: This anime is all about music, so what can you expect? Don&#039;t compare this to k-on!, it&#039;s nothing like it. The anime&#039;s approach on music is much more beautiful, seeing how totally different people can all come together and relate their problems through the expression of music. Although the songs may not be as catchy as you might expect, by the end you&#039;ll be humming the tunes all day and night 9.5/10<br />
<br />
Characters: The characters in this anime aren&#039;t cookie-cutter simple, but not too involving either. The anime is so simple so don&#039;t expect some deep, mind boggling or heart-wrenching shit, but I gurantee you&#039;ll love the characters in the end as mentioned before. 7/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall: This anime is so heart-warming you will NOT regret watching this one. You&#039;ll notice the anime is so entertaining and seemless to watch. Don&#039;t have second thoughts on this because this just may be one of your favorites. 8/10<br />
<br />
Also, for those into anime chicks, Sawa may be the love of your life, just sayin

    Overall a very solid series. Great for anyone who likes a light hearted slice of life type of anime, it&#039;s very similar to Hana saku iroha, basically an anime drama. <br />
<br />
The characters seem very interesting, you have the Energetic girl (as usual), weird guy, well composed girl and girl with a history. Looks like a lot of potential to me. <br />

    [Spoiler Free review (: ]<br />
<br />
Can music solve everyone&#039;s problems? No, it can&#039;t.<br />
Although, sometimes it does helps, gives hope or encouragement.<br />
Some limits can&#039;t be overcome how hard you struggle, dead people can&#039;t come back to life, things that happened in the past can&#039;t be changed and there is no &quot;magic&quot; to help you.<br />
This show talks about moving forward and living in the present. The problems are there and you can&#039;t runaway from them. <br />
In this season lacking of good school slife of life this one caught my attention.<br />
<br />
The topic isn&#039;t new, 3rd year students gather together in a club, while facing daily life problems, they have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review75449">
        to decide their future goals, career, etc...<br />
Actually, Tari Tari surprised me. I first tought it would be like any other story but it was a pleasant surprise when I found out it had a really well written storyline and a realistic (and solid) plot which had a satisfying ending, deeper then I expected. <br />
The focus of the story is music of course. But it have a different approach from K-ON! for example. In this show they see the singing as a enjoyable way to spend time but also a way to work out their problems. Something that&#039;s very nice because it escapes from the ordinary &quot;school clubs&quot; animes.<br />
[Did you know?] The expression TariTari can mean a lot of things, it may be use as a vague expression for saying &quot;doing this, doing that&quot; but also means &quot;variety&quot; (of music, places, stuff..) It&#039;s a interesting title that matches with the story.<br />
<br />
Tari Tari doesn&#039;t have a &quot;main&quot; character. Good tales don&#039;t necessarily require one. This gives more movement to the plot, and you can enjoy each character development, all together. It may be, indeed, more focused into Wakana and Sawa stories, but this is  solely due to the fact their problems were more difficult to solve than the others&#039;.  <br />
Btw, this show have very interesting characters. They&#039;re the type of characters you get attached to. You see they changing through the story and, in the end, cheer for them to have a happy life. It&#039;s often said that the friendships you make in your school days will last forever. These characters kind of prove it.<br />
<br />
About Art,<br />
TariTari follows this new style of setting where the scenario is the exact copy of the original place from the model town. I mean, after you finish watching, if you&#039;re curious, you can find it on Google Maps! It&#039;s nice because it gives the feeling you&#039;re watching something close to reality, which is, the essence of slife-of-life. It was carefully animated. Nothing to complain here.<br />
<br />
Something that kind of disappointed me, was the lack of songs. It been a music-focused anime, I expected more inserted soundtrack and performs from the protagonists. Even though, this doesn&#039;t take the merit from the ones they did. Very well performed as you&#039;d expect from a skilled cast like this. This time, they also featured the singing of a real high school chorus for all the bgm and ost. &quot;Makuhari Sogo High School Chorus Club&quot;, which in my opinion, is one of the best I&#039;ve ever listened to.<br />
<br />
This season, Tari Tari was my rough diamond in the dirt. <br />
I can&#039;t understand why it&#039;s still ranked so low... Seems like it didn&#039;t made the inicial &quot;impact&quot; as others did even it being a nice and entertaining show.<br />
:::Story&gt; 9|10 / Art&gt; 8|10 / Characters&gt; 8|10 / Sound&gt; 9|10 / Enjoyment&gt; 10|10 / Overall&gt; 8|10:::<br />
Thx for reading and please give Tari Tari a try :)<br />
<br />

    Tari Tari is a thirteen episode slice of life anime that just finished airing today. I had been watching it weekly for a while now, and after watching the final episode, I will say that overall I felt it was pretty satisfying to watch, but it really didn&#039;t do enough to stand out very much.<br />
<br />
So, first of all, Tari Tari is another slice of life anime set in high school. Unless you&#039;re really new to anime, you&#039;ve probably seen a slice of life anime set in high school at least ten times already.  High school is anime&#039;s favorite place, and I&#039;m willing to bet

          <span style="display: none;" id="review73133">
        over 85% of all anime is set in high school. I find this really strange. Like seriously, what do Japanese people like so much about high school? Is it really that interesting a place? <br />
Well, putting that aside, what&#039;s it about? Well, to put it simply, it&#039;s about five seniors who each all have their own interests (music, horseback riding, badminton, etc). One of the seniors leaves the music club because the teacher directing it is a jerk, and she starts her own choir club. She recruits the four other seniors mentioned earlier and they do various choir club activities such as going to a recital, performing on stage, and setting up for the culture festival. <br />
Ah yes, the culture festival. Might I also mention that just about every single anime that is set in high school will have a culture festival episode? It&#039;s true man, try naming an anime that doesn&#039;t. You&#039;ll have some trouble. Not that it&#039;s a bad thing, but seeing the same event occur in so many anime makes me feel like I&#039;m seeing the same show over and over again.<br />
Going back on track, well... that&#039;s about it for the plot. Each of the five seniors (and by that I mean the three girls) gets her own arc which consists of around three episodes. Each girl goes through some emotions caused by some sort of trouble, and each girl overcomes her problem and grows stronger. These problems are pretty much what one would expect out of high school students, such as deciding on a future career. The progression of the arcs is really predictable and everything is solved cleanly by the end of each one. <br />
As for the two boy characters, well, all they get is the big gay dance. Tanaka&#039;s badminton troubles are hardly that, and Wien&#039;s conflict with his penpal is resolved in a matter of five minutes. These two boys are so underdeveloped it&#039;s a wonder why they&#039;re even in the anime. My only answer is they&#039;re there solely for the purpose of singing the tenor and bass parts of the songs. <br />
<br />
So how&#039;s the music? Well, since it is an anime about a choir club, it better have some good music, and I&#039;m happy to say it does. Throughout the thirteen episodes, there&#039;s three to four insert songs performed, and they all sound pretty good. The harmonies are great, and the melodies are cute and bouncy. The seiyuus all did a good job singing, and if there&#039;s anything to watch this show for, it&#039;s the songs. There was one really good background song that played during the sad parts of the anime, but that&#039;s about it for the bgm. I can&#039;t say I liked the opening all that much though. Haha the very first image of the characters you see in the opening sticks the two boys far in the back. This is a great foreshadow showing how much they didn&#039;t contribute to the anime! :)<br />
<br />
The art is quite nice on the eyes. The characters are drawn similar to K-ON/Kokoro Connect/Hyouka, and that&#039;s a good thing. While the backgrounds are hardly interesting featuring locations as unique as high school classrooms, high school hallways, high school clubrooms, and outside the high school, they are all drawn really well and are at times animated really splendidly. In particular the last episode looks really nice. There isn&#039;t too much flashy animation, as to be expected from a slice of life. You won&#039;t find any high budget fight scenes here, nor any super spectacular concert scenes. <br />
<br />
So how was it overall? Well I thought it was good. It didn&#039;t break any new grounds, but it was never trying to. If you are a fan of slice of life anime, then I don&#039;t see why you wouldn&#039;t like this. It&#039;s also not &#039;super slice of life,&#039; so if you hated animes that require you to be really into slice of life (for example K-ON, Natsume Yuujincho, or Aria the Animation), you might still like this one. Though the fact that it&#039;s another high school anime really puts it down for me. Cheers to Aria the Animation for not being set in high school! :)

    2 + 2 = 4 <br />
This is a simple equation and a hard fact of maths. If you add 2 and 2 you will have four, its a tried and true fact of life. So why am I bringing this up in an anime review up, well because Tari Tari also religiously follows a tried and true equation,   High school girls + slice of life = Money <br />
<br />
In fact it follows so close that it actually didn&#039;t bother to bring anything original or interesting to the table, and because the writers believed so deeply in this formula they thought that it wouldn’t matter

          <span style="display: none;" id="review74931">
        what they fed us, as long as they stuck to this equation people would watch it. (And the sad fact is, if you look at the blue-ray sales, they where actually right, sigh.)    <br />
<br />
So what is Tari Tari, well here`s a quick summary of what its about.<br />
<br />
Tari Tari follows 5 high school kids with High school problems who form their own choir club due to the main character, Konatsu, being unable to &quot;Shine&quot; in the original music club. The main plot revolves around each of the main characters  providing a look into each ones goals and life ambitions and the problems they face in achieving these goals. <br />
<br />
It all sounds simple enough but here`s where the problems come in, the main plot, that of the group led by Miyamoto Konatsu trying to perform at the cultural festival, while a simple enough idea is so poorly written and executed that it ruins the whole series, confused, let me explain...   <br />
 <br />
the idea of a group of teenagers, all with their own problems, being brought together by music and then working to put on a big show is a pretty good idea, Sakamichi no Apollon (kids on the slope) did this idea too but they did it so much better because it was much better written. These characters had their problems too but they where more relatable and, most important of all their problems weren’t solved in two episodes so the story could move onto another character with problems. <br />
<br />
Also the music played a much bigger part in Sakamichi no Apollon, you really get a feel that these characters are being brought together despite their differences because of there love of jazz, with Tari Tari no one really seemed to care about the music club for much of the series and it certainly never seemed to bring them together or help them with their problems, in fact they all solved their problems on their own so what was the point of this series.   <br />
<br />
<br />
Not only that but there where some really stupid scenes in this series as well. Like with the sub plot about the school being closed down because some rich guy wants to build a hotel, I mean what is this a 90s Disney channel tv movie, come on how lame is this. Theres even a scene where the rich guy is sitting in a big chair looking over an expensive wine bottle while telling the principle hes going to close the school, oh I get it, hes a bad guy isnt he. they should have just had him counting dollar bills while stroking an evil cat and spitting on orphan puppies, if your going to do a stupid scene like that you might as well go the whole way don’t ya think. <br />
<br />
<br />
But to be honest this show isn’t really about the plot, its more about the characters and how they fight against their problems and  obstacles in order to achieve there dreams. And while all five protagonists have believable problems, mostly typical of your average teenager, the show again suffers from bad writing and clichéd ideas. You see again they followed a formula with the characters, introduce them and their goals + add problems + shake well = leave to cool for 1 episode then move onto another character. Then there’s the characters themselves, despite this being a character driven story we find out very little about some characters and too much about others,  very little time is devoted to the male characters, they are developed shocking little in this series and given very little screen time and attention compared to the female characters. I mean I suppose there was some attempt to give them depth like with the sup plot about Wien and some childhood friend back in Austria (which again is horribly written to the point where its almost comical) but its very small in comparison to the female cast. <br />
<br />
The main problem with the characters is again the belief of the writers that by adding a few scenes of people crying and some sad back story’s this would count as character development, it does not. Character development is when we the audience can relate to characters who feel like real people and we watch and learn how they grow and change throughout the course of the story, its not devoting two episodes to a character crying because she cant do what she wants then ignoring them for the rest of the story. <br />
<br />
Now to be fair some of the back-storys where quite sad and moving such as Wakana`s with the story  of her dead mother, but again it could nave been done much better with some decent writing and some good direction.  <br />
<br />
<br />
So anyway the problems with this series aren’t particularly complicated or mysterious, its just a simple case of a series that tried to be quirky and whimsical with characters that warmed your heart, but instead it fell its face face due to bad writing, lack of imagination and  using every cliché in the book. Overall not a bad series but there’s so many other that do this idea much, much better such as  Sakamichi no Apollon, watch that instead.

    Dreadfully boring, essentially it&#039;s &quot;First World Problems: The Anime&quot;.<br />
<br />
Essentially the main character wants to sing in her choir club, but doesn&#039;t have enough members. Due to some unseen and quite honestly uninteresting previous issue with singing in public, the MC is hellbent on getting people with little to no interest in joining her club to join her club, for instance she black mails her brother, and a few other uninteresting characters into joining her club.<br />
<br />
Basically it&#039;s a redemption story, based on events that happened prior to the show, and gets vaguely alluded to, and a rather self-centered MC who want others to help her make

          <span style="display: none;" id="review66925">
        up for her own fault by dragging in people who have nothing to do with it.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s also faux drama drummed up in the form of the overly-antagonistic Assistant Vice Principal or whatever, who for the tone of the show seems cartoonishly hell-bent on ending the Choir club.

    Tari Tari is a glaring example of an anime with commonly done themes, as is evident from one glance at its genres— School, Slice of Life, Music, Drama. It is centered on five members of a choir club, each with their own tribulations of &#039;growing up&#039; as they strive to make the best out of their last year of high school, rectify some mistakes made in the past and accomplish their goals.  There are quite a handful number of titles out there that make use of this subject with the hope of bringing something decent to the screen. Some pull it off somehow while

          <span style="display: none;" id="review73273">
        a few mess up,  and while it&#039;s true that Tari Tari is by no means groundbreaking, it certainly lives up to what it attempts to achieve and what any sane viewer would expect it to be— a simple, unpretentious and heart warming school drama.  <br />
<br />
Last year P.A. Works, the studio behind Tari Tari, gave us Hanasaku Iroha and anyone who has watched it must have felt the resemblance between the two shows since both more or less take a similar approach in terms of not only the story but also to some extent, the characters and of course the visuals. I must confess that the only reason why I picked Tari Tari was because it seemed to be reminiscent of Hanairo which I admired a lot when I watched it a year ago. Like Hanairo, Tari Tari starts off with a somewhat laid back atmosphere and then takes a dramatic turn, especially towards the end. It delivered everything it could have, given its length and the story line, and probably would have felt draggy if it was any longer. The characters were lively and relatable. The way it was wrapped up, though nothing unique, was quite satisfactory overall. <br />
<br />
Visually, Tari Tari was a treat. It was a pleasure to behold the beautiful, detailed backgrounds. The character designs were fine, nothing revolutionary there. It also had some nice catchy songs that fit the bill. I especially like the opening theme &#039;Dreamer&#039; by AiRi and I&#039;ll probably be humming it for quite some time now. <br />
<br />
Overall, Tari Tari is your run of the mill school life-esque drama that certainly doesn&#039;t stand out much but I see no harm in giving it a try if you ever feel like, that is. <br />

    After first episode I&#039;m afraid this show have pretty bad future in my eyes, and here is why:<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s think, combination of which titles could born Tari Tari? First group is school music-related series such as K-On or fresh Natsuiro Kiseki. Second group is titles, revolving around teenagers in japanese country with dose of drama, such as Hanasaku Iroha (also it have same visual style) or Ano Natsu.<br />
<br />
And basicly I don&#039;t think that&#039;s a good mash up.<br />
<br />
Both K-On and NK are about &quot;cute girls doing thier cute things&quot;, there is nearly no drama, and that&#039;s why they naturally combines with pop music. In HI and AN

          <span style="display: none;" id="review65065">
        we have huge dramatic part, but they don&#039;t do anything creative: in first we have just normal ryokan scenery, in second we see creation of nearly documental movie. Ofc there is pleany of musical series combining both drama and creativity, but they&#039;re exploiting rebellious rock/punk culture. And since we have title about choral music, I&#039;m afraid it&#039;s gonna be rebellious, to transparent fight vs teachers or globally system, and thus most likely we&#039;ll have totally unnatural cadaver of cheering choral music and dramatic plot.<br />
<br />
The only thing I&#039;ve enjoyed alot is nice backgrounds, I think people who&#039;ve selected photos did great work.

    Tari Tari, at first glance is very slice-of-life. First time I trace it, I thought it will have multiple aspects of dance (in my language, &quot;Tari&quot; could mean &quot;dance&quot;). Overall, it made me gone &quot;Jackiechan&quot;.<br />
<br />
Story is comparable to La Corda D&#039;Oro plus Natsuiro Kiseki without any magic and greatly reduced romance (hint: last episode). Given the struggle to fulfil last wishes together with very intense obstacle, it could have been a deep penalty, but I still forgive the happy ending. Final score: B+<br />
<br />
Artwork is very safe. With moe design and fairly tall character (discount Konatsu!), it provides satisfaction and must-not-fap face.The environment drawing is also

          <span style="display: none;" id="review73707">
        rated high. The school is very well-drawn and artistic. Final score: A.<br />
<br />
Sound could be considered aces for this season. Thanks to Ayahi Takagaki and Saori Hayami (both are top-of-the-line), it generates god-only-knows music. Ayahi Takagaki going high-pitch also in this anime, something rare to find. The sound effect also excellent. Final score: A<br />
<br />
Character is vary and dynamic. Wakana for example, she turns from tsundere to really caring. This adds multiple increment for already-high score. In fact, all characters in this anime is matured throughout the series. Double-pack this with good design, additional score is assured to be beyond upper threshold. Final Score: A<br />
<br />
Enjoyment is almost non-exist other than good ending. Sawa could learn equestrian, Tanaka learns badminton (in Indonesia or China?), Atsuhiro (Wien) finally meet his friend back in Vienna, Konatsu enters university, Wakana is a bit questionable but some educated guess will lead that she manages to study music in university. Fanservice is also minimum to mere bikini shot. Final Score: B+<br />
<br />
Grand total: A. <br />
<br />
PS: in my anime league, this anime rated in fourth after Symphogear, R-15, and La Corda with GPA 3.95 (head-to-head against La Corda and top two got GPA 4)

    As I am reading the reviews for Tari Tari, I can&#039;t help but notice that many people think that this show is just another &#039;Moe&#039; anime. Although I can see the basis of these comments (*Cough *Cough Konatsu) but what Tari Tari differs from the rest is within its characters and story.<br />
<br />
Story:10/10<br />
<br />
The main story of Tari Tari is a simple one: it is about the members of a choir club working all together in hope for the final competition. It is nothing out of the norm, but from the daily lives of the members, we have the sub-plots of the members from the choir club.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review189582">
        The anime isn&#039;t structured arc-to-arc and everything happens simultaneously, so one character could be developed in the first half of the episode and another character could be developed in the second half. But the show somehow manages to holds itself cohesively together and make us understand what is happening. This gives a more real life feel to the anime and it makes the characters more realistic.<br />
<br />
The stories themselves are well written. Although some are cliché but because the show created a realistic environment through its structures, it would make you think that these cliché scenes are actually achievable. <br />
<br />
Art:9/10<br />
<br />
One would expect a great visual experience when it comes to P.A. (the same animator for Angel Beats). And Tari Tari is no difference. The visual is well-done, everything seem so colourful and it really made me feel like I was there watching everything unfold. <br />
<br />
Sound:8/10<br />
<br />
As a show about a choir club that specialises in singing, the sound in Tari Tari isn&#039;t the most memorable, you would expect some great ear-cateching singings from the characters but they barely do any singing. Not to say the sound is bad because it is definitely not. But it could do with a lot more improvement.<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
<br />
Now THIS is where the show shines, in Tari Tari, the characters all have their own problems that they have to overcome, but everyone goes at their own problems in their own ways. But the characters all support each other in the times of need. It is from these interactions that we find out how every character behaves or thinks. <br />
<br />
The character development is wonderful, it secretly develops the character through their every day lives without you noticing. But after you noticed the character development, it is already too late, you already feel whole-heartedly about them. This is going back the the structure of the plot. Everything happens simultaneously, you are not given a fixed camera on one person, instead , you get to see a bit of everyone. You don&#039;t get to see all the details with the character developing this way but you were given to see what the animator want you to see, and you feel how the animator want you to feel, with no additions from any unnecessary plots.<br />
<br />
Overall:10/10<br />
<br />
Tari Tari is being treated as another &#039;Moe&#039; anime because of its art style and its bland story, but there might be a little bit more about this anime that just cute girls and music. Because of its plot and characters,  Tari Tari don&#039;t deserve to be called a moe anime, and I think everyone should at least give it a try and then come back and tell me how blatantly wrong I am. But before that, Tari Tari is definitely a 10/10 in my list.

    A show I expected to dislike. When I read the summary I was semi intrigued due to the focus on music, but was unsure when I noticed the high school setting. Oh, I thought, another boring and dull and basic high school drama that is just BLAH. Boy, was I wrong...well, for the most part. Tari Tari is definitely not your typical high school comedy, it brought me to tears, made me laugh, and made me realize why I love listening to music. However, to be honest, there were some definite flaws, but not SO definite that it made me ever want it to end.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review74071">
        I&#039;ll start with the flaws. One major flaw I found was how extremely immature the majority of the main characters acted. If they were middle schoolers it would make sense, but during my senior year of high school I was never so immature. I found it surprising that there was little to no romance throughout the show. I found that somewhat unrealistic considering their ages. Yes, boys and girls can be friends, but COME ON, you spend EVERY DAY with each other and there isn&#039;t ANY hint of romance(there is SOME, but nothing that changes the dynamic of the show)? I found that somewhat strange. In addition, some of their actions and routines were childish, cute, but childish nonetheless. I felt it took away from the story, but only for a second. I found really nothing else wrong with the show, at times it was cliche, and I did cringe at some parts just by how cheesy it was, but overall Tari Tari deserves to be watched for many reasons. What reasons? I&#039;m glad you asked! First off, the PARENTS of the show made it for me. I loved each parent, they developed their own personalities and changed along with their children. It was refreshing to see that, because usually the parents are stagnant characters that stay two dimensional, but not in Tari Tari. I found myself loving the parents as much as the high school kids. In addition, THE MUSIC, what absolutely breath taking music, especially the piano solo parts. Each song made me smile, and by the end I was tearing up because I felt so emotionally connected to the song even though I can&#039;t speak one word of Japanese. To me that takes skill, and I applaud the writers/producers of this show. I felt invested, I felt loved, I felt friendship throughout the show in a way that for the MOST part was realistic and made my heart honestly beat faster and my smile grow wider. I am an adventure loving, gore thrilling, sword wielding show kinda gal, but Tari Tari has made me want to give Slice&#039;s of Life more chances. It was the music, the characters, the art, the overall atmosphere that made me love Tari Tari, and I highly recommend it to all of you! :)<br />
<br />
P.S = If you like horses you might like this show, too! I am a major horse lover and having a horse in the show made it even better in my opinion! :D

    At the end of June I was pretty sad. With the end of Kimi To Boku. 2 came an uneasy feeling. Like something was missing. This certain heartwarming feeling I get from watching a sweet, authentic and clever told slice of life-anime.<br />
<br />
In an act of.....desperation I guess, I browse through the summer anime line-up once more to stop at Tari Tari saying &quot;You&#039;ll be my new Kimi To Boku., ok? Be nice to me!&quot;. The addition of music was promising, too. <br />
<br />
After watching the first two episodes, I wasn&#039;t sure if my choice to watch Tari Tari was a mistake or not. The pace seemed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review73265">
        akwardly rushed. But staying optimistic, I just hoped it would slow down after that and give the characters some time, to develope and shine.<br />
It slowed down indeed and focused on the characters, but not in a way it should&#039;ve. At least I don&#039;t think so. <br />
The characters basically took their turns getting depressed, so they could cheer up at the end of each episode (or after two episodes) through the power of friendship and music. <br />
That itself is an ok idea, but just not executed well. Instead of dealing with the circumstances the characters are confronted in a subtle way, the show throws it right in the face of the people watching like it&#039;s yelling &quot;HEY, I&#039;M DRAMATIC NOW! Feel sorry for the characters!&quot; just to demand &quot;awww&quot;s and tears of joy later.<br />
The opening is a perfect example for this. There the female main-characters are shown one after the other all sad and crying, just to pluck up courage then and be happy while singing and laughing with the others, eww.<br />
<br />
Speaking about the characters. There isn&#039;t really much for me to say about them.<br />
They suffered from the shallow presentation and thus could never grow on me, let alone be taken seriously.<br />
This is not to say that they never had their moments to shine. Every now and then they really succeeded in being charismatic and appealing. Especially in comical scenes. Unlike the drama, those weren&#039;t as overly exaggerated. Instead they were done in a more likable and subtle way.<br />
<br />
But the same goes for the whole show itself, I think.<br />
If it just would&#039;ve contained the drama (quite) a bit and put more effort in making the characters and their situations more authentic it could&#039;ve been way better.<br />
Of course it&#039;s only natural for a show to specifically trigger emotions, but Tari Tari is just trying WAY to hard.<br />
With that happening throughout the whole series there was no way I could take it serious as a slice of life-series. It felt like an overdramatized and too theatrical show, that was just there to sneak in some tearjerkers and pretend to be smart and profound.<br />
<br />
The music being one of the main themes I expected a bit more from it. <br />
The songs and bgm-tracks were nice, sure. But there were very few of them and not really much of variety. Meaning the two &quot;main&quot;-songs (from Wakana&#039;s mother and her own) sounded too much alike.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not going into detail regarding the animations because they don&#039;t really matter in this kind of anime. <br />
I didn&#039;t like the character design, but that&#039;s just my opinion. No criticism because of that.<br />
<br />
And the word &quot;opinion&quot; is perfect to conclude this review.<br />
I didn&#039;t like the way the show forced it&#039;s uncreative, linear drama on me. At times I even hated it.<br />
But I&#039;m not saying that because of that, the show is undeniably bad. There are people who like this kind of presentation and that&#039;s fine (more or less). Nothing wrong with that. <br />
All I wanna say is that people who like smart and well-thought-out slice of life, that is authentic and not too naive at the same time, should stay away from this show. Watch Kimi To Boku. or Usagi Drop instead.
