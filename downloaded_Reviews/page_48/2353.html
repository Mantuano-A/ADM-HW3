    Our favorite flying witches are back to liberate Europe from the Neuroi scourge!  Without wearing any pants.  For those of us who saw the original Strike Witches (or Pantsu Witches as I like to say) anime you had to know what you were going to be in store for.  A lot of fan service, cute girls, and panty shots.  But a funny thing happened with this over the top and gratuitous ecchi anime, it’s a hell of a lot of fun to watch!<br />
<br />
Much like the original, Strike Witches 2 features a plot you could have written out on a cocktail napkin.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30731">
         The fight against the Neuroi continues, this time moving on to Romagna, which is the real world analog of Italy.  The girls of the 501st Fighter wing are reformed to battle the Neuroi presence.  Happily, especially early in the series the action is really ramped up.  But what is likely to disappoint is the lack of any development of the enemy.  None of the important events of the first series were carried over and the Neuroi returned to being a faceless and unthinking enemy.  I was also disappointed that nothing new was explained about the disappearance of Miyafugi&#039;s father.  The series does climax with an epic battle, culminating with the use of a special magical attack that is pretty much the only reoccurring plot element over the course of the show.<br />
<br />
Despite the lack of any substantive plot however, the series does shine over each episode.  Instead of a story, the episodes focus on building the characters of our various heroines.  New witches are brought into the fold, the most interesting being Barkhorn&#039;s countryman and rival Mariselle.  The episodes range from being the usual comedic silliness to light drama and quite a bit more yuri undertones than in the previous series.  As expected the ecchi content is extremely high, so if that annoys you then this really isn’t your show.  Much like the first season, the forthcoming DVDs will be featuring a bounty of boobs and booty, unblocked by the TV versions convenient sunbeams and steam clouds.  Though as pervy as it is, for me it seemed much less exploitive and in your face as it did previously.  So those who might be on the fence might be relieved to know that the series doesn’t revolve around seeing some underage girls panties, you just happened to see them a lot. <br />
<br />
As with the original, SW2 features its unique mix of World War 2 history with all of the magic and witchcraft.  Fans of military history will be delighted to see the attention to detail paid to the designs of all the various nations’ naval ships and right down to the aviation correlations with the witches Striker Units and the weapons they carry into battle.  I am by no means an authority but I can tell the amount of research and attention to detail the production staff went to in order to have each of the girls use nation specific weaponry and unit names.<br />
<br />
Because of the weakness of the main story, what really carries the series is its wonderful cast.  While the cast is quite large and it’s really impossible to do justice to all of the girls, SW2 does a pretty good job at trying.  Obviously you will get far more out of this series if you already have the familiarity with them that comes with seeing the first season.  For the most part each girl or pairing gets their own episode to build on their characters.  I found some characters that I didn’t particularly care for previously, such as Perrine, were much more fun and likable this time around.  Though others like Lucchini remained annoying.  As I mentioned earlier, more time was spent developing some yuri relationships between several of the characters.  Though it’s nothing particularly significant, fans of that sort of thing are sure to be pleased.<br />
<br />
Visually the art and animation is quite stunning.  For me other than the pure fun I had watching it this was the best element of series.  The girls are extremely cute and appealing and since we see so much of them in their birthday suits they are also realistically proportioned.  The series combat scenes are exciting and chalk full of a combination of conventional battle and magical effects.  The detail of the various backgrounds which feature many famous Italian landmarks and the countryside.  Everything from the naval and military forces down to the ammo clips on the weapons has a very authentic feel to them.<br />
<br />
The music really sets the tone for each episode.  The upbeat OP performed by Youko Ishida pumped me up for the fun that proceeded after.  The ED theme is similarly enthusiastic and changes up week by week as it is performed by different members of the cast.  The background music also enhances the series many battle scenes.  The seiyuu cast is strong and full of many of the industry’s top talents.<br />
<br />
I loved this series enormously and I am going to be very sad to see it go away.  Despite all the things about this show that should make every ounce of my feminist being burst into flames, Strike Witches was just really fun.  Everything it lacks in substance (and clothing) is more than made up in sheer entertainment value.  Turn off your brain and smile a little and I think you will enjoy it as much as I did.<br />

    Currently, we&#039;re two episodes in, and already the show has dived straight into the thick of things.<br />
<br />
Naturally, this being a sequel to the original Strike Witches, it is pretty much a prerequisite that one has watched the first season before. However, in my opinion, this series may yet turn out to be better than its predecessor.<br />
<br />
The story has as of yet not had time to develop, with the series still in the process of re-introducing the characters; however, the manner in which this has been done, including a first episode that parallels somewhat the manner in which the main protagonist was introduced in the first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review28441">
        season, runs smooth as silk. Reintroduction episodes are normally rather snooze-worthy - Strike Witches Season 2 throws us into action right from the start with a dogfight within the first ten minutes of the first episode, hitting the ground already up and running. This sets up the rest of the show for more of the flygirl characters we know and love.<br />
<br />
The art, no way else to put it, is amazing. AIC took over from Gonzo for this season, but the characters still look exactly the same - if not even better than before. The backgrounds, noticeably stiffer in Gonzo&#039;s animation, have been rendered in breathtaking quality. The vista-like skies add to the overall sense of freedom in flight that permeates the show, while the characters themselves appear to move unrestricted throughout the battle scenes. AIC&#039;s use of 3DCG characters is almost unnoticeable, with a very smooth transition between CG and frame-by-frame animation when the characters zoom toward and away from the viewer.<br />
<br />
Naturally, this being Strike Witches, the pantsu shots fly freely. AIC has taken liberty with this, littering the show with perhaps one too many frames of female crotches. They&#039;re beautifully rendered crotches from a great many angles, no doubt, but toning down a little would greatly reduce the discomfiture of many (and greatly increase the chagrin of quite a few, I admit).<br />
<br />
The sound is also rather mediocre. The OP and ED are instantly forgettable; the inserts, while nothing much, add greatly to the feel of the show, and in this way redeem themselves. The soundtrack is probably not something you&#039;d listen to over and over again, but it does its job.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, the show is a step up from the previous series so far. The show seems to have gained a grander sense of things, a more &quot;epic&quot; feel, so to speak. Fitting for a show featuring golden-era fighter aces battling to save the world once again. The show has a long way yet to prove itself worthy of the original government-endorsed series of cultural excellence; but so far, it looks set to meet, and possibly even surpass, the original.

    Strike Witches is a show I&#039;ll have a special place in my heart for for a long time, especially since they&#039;re still consistently coming out with entries apparently. This review will kind of be sectioned off, so yeah.<br />
First, Strike Witches itself, which it feels like I finished a long time ago cause I kinda did. Strike Witches is far and away the ˢᵉᶜᵒⁿᵈ best military girls anime I&#039;ve seen. No but Girls und Panzer this is not, here they&#039;re actually at war and also it&#039;s a Mahou Shoujo. They wear the &quot;striker units&quot; on their legs which means they just never wear pants, though some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review359336">
        wear tights. Yes, Strike Witches is very much a fanservice anime, and here I mean it in the best way possible. Strike Witches is actively indulgent in pleasing the crowd that likes cute kemonomimi military girls to the point where you get actual uncensored titties every other episode, and I love every second of it. None of it even felt distasteful because Strike Witches is designed as an ecchi from the ground up, actually to me it came off as just making it cuter rather than trying to be hot. But it&#039;s not only an ecchi, it&#039;s a character-focused magical girl action/slice-of-life ecchi.<br />
Strike Witches has a phenomenal cast. Everyone is perfectly characterized such that I can practically sympathize with them all no matter what they do, this accompanying the fact that they&#039;re pretty much all somewhat archetypal and the eleven girls in the 501st are pretty much all the major characters. Yoshika, Lynne, and Perrine were all super enjoyable to watch as they grew into experienced witches the rest could count on, Yoshika especially with her latent OP powers. Also Yoshika and Lynne are such an adorable couple oh my god. Mina and Mio were lovable and charismatic leaders, even when they were harsh. Barkhorn&#039;s soft side in contrast with her usual self is the cutest thing. Shirley, Lucchini, and Hartmann were endearing and funny, and Sanya and Eila were a heartwarming pair. All the girls are so perfect I can&#039;t quite do a &quot;I especially like x&quot; because I love them all almost equally. Though if asked, I&#039;d say I particularly love Lynne and Shirley. <br />
I like the way it looks. It&#039;s got a smooth, classic look and a light color palette that look great and serve the anime perfectly. The fight scenes themselves, being a sort of hybrid of human combat and plane combat, are always fun and interesting to watch, and especially at season finales they have some great hype moments as well. Most of the girls&#039; individual powers, while it&#039;s great that they&#039;re there, aren&#039;t very interesting on their own and most aren&#039;t really explored or explained outside the segments at the end of the spinoff. That&#039;s fine though since this aspect is usually treated secondarily to, say, being able to fly well.<br />
The plot is the simple &quot;protag joins organization to fight faceless enemy&quot; as seen in Symphogear and YuYuYu. It worked well and those shows and it works well here; as a device for serving character interactions and fight scenes it more than gets the job done, though considering the second half of the first season I wish we got a little more about the Neuroi. I also like how they&#039;ve made their own little alternate world map with different names for countries, it gives the world more of an identity.<br />
Also every single piece of music written for this series is fantastic, including the OST&#039;s. The OP&#039;s and ED&#039;s are cute and catchy with memorable and striking visuals, and the OST are recognizable and fitting.<br />
Overall, Strike Witches is a fantastic military mahou shoujo, with some of the best character interactions I&#039;ve seen and easily the most unexpected lack of censorship. Season 2 Episode 6 is a masterpiece by itself and Yoshika x Lynne is the best yuri bait couple ever.

    Strike Witches 2, the amazing sequel to Strike Witches<br />
<br />
Much like the prequel the plot is really weak, we start off with the Strike Witches reforming after they disbanded at the end of the original series and through-out a number of the episodes nothing really develops, the Strike Witches would usually go on a little adventure and then go and defeat the Neuroi of the week.  However just because an anime series doesn&#039;t have a strong plot doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s bad, in fact it is quite the contrary.  There are a number of great series out there with a weak or non-existing plot and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30742">
        this is one of them.<br />
<br />
Every episode the Strike Witches would have it&#039;s own story which usually revolved around 1 or 2 certain characters.  Every episode contained a different mood, it was always fun to watch and as bonus had some pantie shots (and a lot of ecchi too).  There was a little bit yuri too (which I personally liked).<br />
<br />
The characters, were amazing and more than made up for the weak plot.  Since every episode would develop a different character (or different characters) you really feel for each of them.  This entire series is carried by the lovable cast who are each very unique.<br />
<br />
The art and animation was done really well.  The battle scenes looked smooth and really detailed, the background was nicer this time around too.  I really don&#039;t have much to say about this part other than AIC did a really good job.<br />
<br />
The sound is pretty nice too with a catchy tune and a different character singing the ending song every week.  The voice actors were good too, the voices fit each of their characters quite well.<br />
<br />
In the end Strike Witches 2 was one of my favorites if not favorite series of the season.  It&#039;s really sad that this series has come to an end but for the 100th anime series I&#039;ve completed, I&#039;m glad it was the memorable and very enjoyable Strike Witches 2.  Thanks for reading.<br />

    &quot;That Which We Can Do&quot;<br />
<br />
Let me start off by saying I am a &quot;fanboy&quot; of Strike Witches so naturally it was perfect ^_^ . If you were a fan of the 1st Strike Witches you&#039;ll love Strike Witches 2. Its a given. <br />
<br />
Background: The story takes place a couple months after the first season ended. And Yoshika Miyafuji has just finished middle school and is planning on taking over her family&#039;s health clinic. When just like in the original, she receives another letter from her dad! The letter has blue prints for a secret project. This time around she is a retired reserve and needs

          <span style="display: none;" id="review85111">
        Sakamoto help once again. Sakamoto her self is has problems of herself which may lead her to no longer be a Witch. She refuse to allow Yoshika to join the Strike Witch but as stubborn as Yoshika is, she decides to go anyways and convinces the Major, that she will work even harder than ever. Which starts the new story. I don&#039;t want to give to much away so ill stop at that.<br />
<br />
The story this time around is a lot more serious then last time, you&#039;ll notice this toward the end. Its not all fun and games, the anime takes itself a bit more serious which makes a better story all around but don&#039;t worry it still has its funny moments. All the original characters are back with the add of some new ones. The navy has a bigger role which is cool to see and has a bigger influence in the story. Even though Gonzo, the original studio, is no longer apart of this and AIC Spirits is now in charge. They did a fantastic job and didn&#039;t screw it up so thank you AIC Spirits. Side note: be careful watching this around kids, AIC put in a lot more boob scenes unlike the 2 scenes in the original and dedicated a hole episode on a butt Neuroi which was hilarious, I&#039;m not complaining about it one bit, its just a little heads up.<br />
<br />
The intro music is just as awesome as the original and more catchy. The music score for the anime was well done and fell fit the scene that were going on. All the characters act the same which is a good thing. Francesca who likes to grab peoples boobs but none can compare with Charlotte boobs ;). Perrine being stuck up as always except in one of the episodes but still in love with the Major. Lynne and Yoshika are still the best of friends. The action in the anime is just well done and scenes look like a lot of time was spent on making them. Actions scenes look over the top and amazing to look at. This is just one of thous Anime&#039;s that&#039;s hard not to smile at when watching it. Its a good anime all the way through.The only down side I have is that there&#039;s still questions that need to be answered and I&#039;m afraid that they will never be answered. Its been 2 years since it came out and no season 3 but we did get the Strike Witches Movie that came out last year. Lets just hope that&#039;s why they haven&#039;t came out with season 3. This one of my favorites anime of all time, and its a must watch on my list. Fingers crossed for a third season.<br />

    I remember that Strike Witches ended with a sequel hook so I was eagerly awaiting the continuation of the 501st&#039;s war story as any simple minded lowest common denominator type of person that I am would.  No surprises here when I went in expecting only more of the same as the first and not being disappointed.<br />
<br />
Just to get us back in the groove, we are re-introduced as the war with the Neuroi takes a twist for the worse.  Kicking off, we get straight to reassembling the team that led the fight starting with our friend to all living creatures protagonist and her mentor

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30848">
        figure.  But this is where the story lapses back to its slice of life mode and parallels the first season in how the story is presented.  Its not saying that its bad, but the excitement built up is washed away, only to be replaced by the excitement you get for indulging in such a guilty pleasure.  Thankfully, the series kicks back in to high gear once the pleasantries disperse. Its a great ride with a conclusive ending and there isn&#039;t much more satisfying than that.<br />
<br />
Fanservice and the blatant lighting effects involved aside, the art is well done.  Given that in-flight witches are sometimes rendered in 3-D, we are treated to more dogfights, and more action with little decrease in quality but say hello to uncanny valley.  At least this time, there aren&#039;t any more plastic landscapes.  Equipment is still as detailed as ever while the landscape looks as picturesque as could be, especially Rome (and I&#039;ve been to Rome).<br />
<br />
The sound holds up especially well, with the sound effects matching up well to the equipment used.  However, it is once again, the soundtrack that does the score justice.  It goes well with the scenes despite being a bit more prominent and adds to the series.  In fact, there was this one track which serves as a prelude to an epic battle that should really have been named &quot;Play this song and you will kick arse&quot; and that serves as a triumphant example of what a soundtrack should do (in my opinion).<br />
<br />
It is still more or less the same cast of characters so I was relieved when they were able to draw out more characterisation, how very little of it was left.  Passable, and at least the side characters get some of their own little moments as well.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t say I didn&#039;t enjoy Strike Witches, guilty pleasure that it is, especially the Roman Holiday episode.  Even if the plot is an excuse to see girls with a lack of pants fight aerial battles over the scenic Adriatic Sea, I find it hard to dislike.  If you liked the first season, the second gives you more.  And for those pining at the formal dissolution of the 501st, fear not, I suspect the 504th will pick up the sword and continue the fight.

    Strike Witches 2<br />
<br />
 Yoooshikaaaaaa-chaaaaaaaaaaaan!!!!!!!! That&#039;s how I feel after watching this amazing and totally spectacular anime!<br />
<br />
 Continuing off from Strike Witches, 6 months have passed since the end of Strike Witches, a new Neuroi hive has appeared, destroying the old one and any plans of coexistence between the humans and Neuroi, which really sucks, I wanted to know so much more about the humanoid Neuroi, poor thing was destroyed right away =(.<br />
<br />
 Strike Witches 2 continues to follow the same story telling that the original did. Many episodes are about building friendships and trust through hardships that occur. If you felt that some characters weren&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review198217">
        given screen time in Strike Witches, worry not, the rest of the girls all get some time where we can learn more about them. I feel like this way of episodically telling us, the viewers, works really well. Once again, most of the anime doesn&#039;t revolve around the main plot until the last 2-3 episodes; some may call it rushing, but I think it works. Once we get more characterization for the girls, the plot advances and so on. A really neat thing I noticed was how similar many of the beginning episodes in Strike Witches 2 resembled Strike Witches, uncanny in how it was taken care of, so I thought that was really cool.<br />
<br />
 The OP.... is seriously one of the best songs I have ever heard in Japanese anime history, it&#039;s so happy and sounds so freaking good. Have a listen, you won&#039;t be disappointed! There is fantastic music used throughout the anime, once again the people behind this aspect have out done themselves, it&#039;s just absolutely fantastic to listen to. Certain scenes even received music for the occasion so really nice job. The ED Over Sky isn&#039;t bad either, a fun listen as well, but I love the OP.<br />
<br />
 Art Style continues to be amazing as well as the animation involved, colors are popping, the screens are amazing, the girls are incredibly cute, it&#039;s all just a lot of good!<br />
<br />
Over all, Strike Witches 2 is a beautiful and ecchi filled show that everyone should really try watching. Sure there is a lot of pantsu shots and sometimes it&#039;s really extravagantly detailed, but that&#039;s okay(It might even be really welcomed =), it has an amazing set of characters to fall for and get behind, a beautiful world to watch and explore, amazing moments of friendship and trust; it&#039;s just a whole lot of fun!<br />

    Seascape, fresh air, the calm panorama, and so lovely female characters that gives me butterfly-in-my-belly moments &lt;3 Such a soothing atmosphere can immediately, easily, turn into a ruthless war in the endless sea, that&#039;s definitely Strike Witches ٩꒰ಂ❛ ▿❛ಂ꒱۶  <br />
    So called Neuroi, unidentified flying objects, brings terror and haunts humanity. In a blink of an eye, human forces are immobilized by Neuroi and being under attack unstoppable until the area is completely lost control. Only the chosen fighters are suitable to stand in the battle upon Neuroi, those are girls called &quot;Strike Witches&quot;, The 501st Joint Fighter Wing. This squadron

          <span style="display: none;" id="review224684">
        created only purpose to eliminate an conquering-the-earth enemy --Neuroi—with the help of magic that comes naturally as their ability. The ability which only appears from the chosen girls in their adolescence, the magic is used to operate a technology called Striker Unit onto their legs (to do aerial combat).<br />
[somewhat SPOILER] There are also other squadrons, consist of adorable and adamant witches to save the world, mostly Europe—where Neuroi invades its area. In the movie, you can find the 501st Joint Fighter Wing gets help and collaborate with few witches from other squadrons! That was so awe ❤ Find new waifus and other kind of futuristic Striker Units!<br />
<br />
    The idea of fight between humanity with alien (unidentified objects / species) or fighting with modern units to save the world aren&#039;t sort of new things as story, but the development of ideas that already exist before here is on its pinnacle. The environment and atmosphere Strike Witches brought are so fresh and that is what&#039;s noteworthy. Its plot goes pyon-pyon as the threats from Neuroi, slowly but sure, push &#039;em down. Still, the series weren&#039;t focusing on the deadly fights only, it spiced up with a few events where Witches were had their leisure time. We can enjoy appropriately their slacking-off moments, well-suited ecchi-ness hour, not too ecchi and has significance meanings. Just to be blunt, the amount of ecchi-ness is high, but it&#039;s covered by sooo military feelings and fights, so it&#039;s sufficient.<br />
<br />
<br />
    I would say the anime is quite old viewed from the year it is aired. 心配する必要はありません, it has incredible visuals on its year especially when it comes to the battle with Neuroi, the graphics and details of its surroundings still there and seems so natural. In addition, the shape of Striker Units are elegant, the simple character designs are making it memorable, flawlessly dressed its personalities and represent the countries. The tomfoolery of characters in their free-time makes the series fairly likable too, There are also exact fanservices such as パンツ, おっぱい, and for fetishes like ロリ, ツンデレ, and so on to lighten the amount of heavy tense in battles.<br />
<br />
    Subjectively I would like to give plus points for the characters here. Every characters really got its unique traits, so differ from other anime series characters. Eventhough Strike Witches has so many characters in it (even bunch of major characters as a squad), it could make me feel empty whenever one of them is off-duty or missing. They are complete and perfect to be together, supporting each other (both for their roles in war or daily lives). Their designs aren&#039;t overdone much but memorable.<br />
<br />
    The OP theme for S1 is sung by Yoko Ishida &quot;STRIKE WITCHES ~Watashi ni Dekiru Koto~ (ストライクウィッチーズ ～わたしにできること～)&quot; and the ED theme, &quot;Bookmark a Head&quot;, for every eps is the same but the version is changed, so every seiyuu got their parts to sing it. For the OP theme of S2 &quot;STRIKE WITCHES 2 ~Egao no Mahou~ (STRIKE WITCHES 2 ～笑顔の魔法～)&quot;, is also sung by Yoko Ishida, while the concept of ED theme on S2 is the same with S1, the changed version for every eps so every seiyuu got parts to sing it, the title is &quot;Over Sky&quot;. Good enough even this latter-day I still listen to it~ All hail the seiyuus effort!<br />
<br />
<br />
    You can say it through the whole series that it has enthusiastic about the survival, the rights to live, to carry on duties, and lend a hand to others. In short, friendship, caring to each other, trust, strong will, and hard work by their tough training. I enthrone 9+ as score for Strike Witches series.<br />
Pros:<br />
Intriguing story and it&#039;s nicely developed, along with its characters<br />
Nice jokes and balanced by fair fanservices<br />
The graphics and enjoyment!<br />
<br />
(Cons is, the 3rd season is not aired yet -whoopsie XD)

    My favorite series continues with the 11 Witches of the 501 joint fighter wing off participating in more neroi battles with a hive being in a new region, as well being up to all the other goofy antics that occur.   Let&#039;s get into the other part now.<br />
<br />
Concerning the story, it is similar to the first season.  It&#039;s still basically the same amazing story of Yoshika&#039;s struggle to be a witch who can protect everyone she can while forging strong bonds with fellow friends/squad members., with information about people&#039;s past being revealed throughout the journey.  Now, everyone still doesn&#039;t have their past

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256036">
        revealed, which shouldn&#039;t be expected from a 24 episode series with an 11 member main squad, but more of the internal struggles of characters are shared.   We have Mio&#039;s struggle with not being able to erect shields properly anymore ,and forging the Reppumaru sword to help her fight in battle by using the repuzzan  without worrying about needing a shield.  Than there is Gertrude&#039;s problem with the jet striker using up her magic too fast and than blaming herself for not being strong enough for it after being confined to her room, and later coming to grips with the situation as she uses the unit one final time as last resort to save one of her friends.  Yoshika, Lynette, and Perrine also learn how to better control their magic by treating brooms (during training) and their striker units as an extension of their bodies rather than relying on them to fly; I basically mean that they learn to treat their magic  as an extension of themselves rather as a tool (this might not have helped explain it, but it should get the point across).  Eila and Sanya have a struggle with their friendship because the neuroi core for their new mission is too high up and only Sanya&#039;s weapon can hit it but she won&#039;t be able to shield herself while doing it and Eila isn&#039;t selected to be her partner for the mission since she&#039;s never summoned up a shield before; Eila gets angry and frustrated because Yoshika is selected to be Sanya&#039;s shield and even though she trains with others so she can finally put up a shield she just doesn&#039;t seem to be able to do it and gets yelled at by Sanya for giving up to easily; right after Sanya and yoshika are left to fly up to the core, Sanya just looks at Eila wishing she was with her and Eila than rushed up to be the one to protect Sanya, her best friend, with Yoshika&#039;s help, they destroy the neuroi and they grow even stronger as friends.  Mio and Minna also have conflicts within their friendship due to Mio&#039;s diminishing magical power, but I&#039;ll leave the details for you to find out .  Besides all the character growth, there&#039;s also a weird bug like neuroi that attack the girls in the butts and shorts out the electronic equipment at the base, until a very unorthodox method destroys it.  Well, my last statement was just to show that some of the usual weird comedy is still present even though all the seriousness is there.  Overall, I like the story a bit more this season since it focuses a little more on my favorite characters, besides Minna since she doesn&#039;t develop solo as much, and  the final fight is a little better.  .  Still though, I believe Strike Witches has an excellent story even the cast acts a bit silly, hence my 10/10.<br />
<br />
The art is still at least as amazing as it was in season 1.  It&#039;s actually a little better this time around though, but it&#039;s not so drastic that it&#039;s instantly noticeable.   Everything still flows nicely and the character designs are in tact with only slight modifications for one or two.  10/10.<br />
<br />
The sound is yet again, amazing like it was in season 1.  The opening theme is basically just as good as the season 1 opening.   I like Over Sky more than Bookmark Ahead though.  Either way, season 2 keep the same quality in music that season 1 had, and it doesn&#039;t lose that Strike Witches touch.  10/10.<br />
<br />
The best way to differentiate the  characters in season 2 compared to season 1 is to say that they are more developed, which is true.  Each character generally is a bit more developed this season, but since I already went on a bit about that when describing the story, I&#039;m not listing more character struggles and how they overcame some their struggles.  Know that the girls still make up the same quirky cast that you should be used to coming into this season.  I find so much to love about the characters between all their different personalities and such.  I&#039;m glad my favorite cast got more screen time.  10/10.<br />
<br />
Well, from how much I&#039;ve been praising the show, my enjoyment should be a 10/10 too, right?  Well, you&#039;re correct.  My enjoyment is another 10/10 score, since I love everything about Strike Witches, the 2 animated seasons at least, since the manga series and such vary in quality.  It&#039;s a highly enjoyable ride from start to finish if you already liked the cast.  If you don&#039;t like the cast, you probably shouldn&#039;t be watching this season.  I hope you enjoy watching season 2 and aren&#039;t too disappointed.

    Strike Witches 2, like its predecessor, is my guilty pleasure. I feel a bit like a pre-pubescent girl when watching it (this from a 40-ish year old man). It has some deep flaws in the core, but it also has some redeeming qualities, which generally makes it watchable - if only for a specific interest group.<br />
<br />
Starting with the Good: If you&#039;re into War Anime, or a fan of WWII-era aircraft and lore, you may have a strong attraction to this series. The aerial combat, aircraft, and weapons designs are very tasty to the eyes. The story, in general (as of episode 4, and in general

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29316">
        all of the 1st season) is enjoyable and at times actually enrolling. The characters are well-developed, although it very much relies on the viewer knowing them from the 1st season. <br />
<br />
The Mediocre: The music and voice-acting for this series is good, but not outstanding - &quot;appropriate&quot; is about the best I can say, although I can&#039;t say anything decidedly negative. Call it &quot;On Par&quot; with most good anime.<br />
<br />
The Bad: The main characters - essentially all the female characters - are walking contradictions of themselves. They vary in age from 13 to 20, but you&#039;d have a hard time convincing anyone of that from the art alone. The characters are drawn to appear generally younger than actual age, although some have - inappropriately mature parts, compared to the perceived body maturity otherwise. As far as the male character goes - sorry, &quot;characters&quot; - good luck telling them apart. They&#039;re not the focus, so they&#039;re pretty indistinct. When they appear at all.<br />
<br />
The Ugly: This franchise is infamous for it&#039;s panty-shots. The plot and its technology/magic combo gives the girls a reason to bare their legs continuously - and this season they seem to have dropped any pretense of using that to justify the underpants, none of which seem to come past half-crack-height. This season seems to have a lot more censor-glare than was required of the first. This season also seems, again just after the first four episodes, to have migrated from &quot;innocent young girl friendship grope&quot; to something with a bit more squick behind it. I hope that this is a passing thing.<br />
<br />
The Summary: The plot, the tech art and combat scenes, and some aspects of the characters are entertaining for a military buff who doesn&#039;t mind girls - fans of Sora No Woto, for example (a much better anime) might enjoy this. If you can get past the squick. And believe me, there&#039;s a fair bit of squick.

    This show is far from perfect, but some episodes are simply flawless. Episode 11 was one of the best episodes of anime I have ever seen. <br />
<br />
The art is consistently above average, a few mistakes here and there, the DVD version will most likely rectify that. I wish the story was slightly more developed, especially the backgrounds of the different witches, The pacing is a bit slow at times, nothing that bothered me though. The music is great and characters are lovable, I can almost guarantee that everyone will find at least one character they like.

    This is a re-do since I just now know that the movie is going to explain some of my past issues with this movie. This is going to be short so here it goes.<br />
Cons<br />
-A bit redundant<br />
-Nothing EXACTLY new<br />
<br />
Pros<br />
-More of what you expect and like<br />
-Episode 7<br />
-More Strike Witches and Neuroi<br />
-More background to every character<br />
<br />
Its freakin&#039; strike witches. If you liked the first season you&#039;re going to love the second season.

    The magic flying cat girls are back for one more time and for a brand new story.<br />
<br />
This season is the continuation of the first season of Strike Witches. So after what happened in the end of the first season, 6 months passed and our protagonist was able to join her beloved team once again for a new mission. This time it&#039;s in Europe. Italy to be specific. The story is the same deal with minor changes and some advancements, not too much to congratulate. 7/10<br />
<br />
This season aired 2 years after the first season, yet the quality is just a bit superior. The animation is mostly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406233">
        fluid, although I noticed it being quite choppy at some point. The designs are the same and everything is pretty fine. 7/10<br />
<br />
Just like in the first season we have an opening, ~Egao no Mahou~ which was decent but not exactly great, perhaps a 6.5/10 or 7. And an ending with several versions, that was over the sky. It was fine as well but not over 7. The voice actors are doing their jobs well enough as usual. Sound gets a 6<br />
<br />
This season didn&#039;t really develop the characters, a thing which dissapointed me. It just wishes to remain in the crappy plot Ecchi group. We get more content and stuff but the characters don&#039;t unfold their emotions or pasts. We just know that for some reason this one does that and behaves like this (not like those are any complex or have many different habits) and that the other girl does that etc. Not great, this is the second season, 24 episodes and an OVA in the anime and we still don&#039;t know so many things. Character gets a 5<br />
5/10<br />
<br />
Although it was pretty so-and-so, I enjoyed this season about the same or a bit less than the first one, this time we had even less plot with basically 4 episodes with any kind of plot and the rest were random things (for example ep 1 was the introduction and how our protagonist got back and made the team again, ep2-10 were random training and missions with no real contribution to the story but this time the themes seemed really filler-like, stuff like going shopping, going to the beach, having a bug that gets in the girls&#039; butts) Well, no matter what, this season was at least fun to watch, we got a hell ton of Ecchi material and more story. Pretty dissapointed with how the anime hadn&#039;t fixed a single big issue but well it was still comedic and fine, I really can&#039;t give this season a higher rating (smh it has a higher rating than S1) because it was literally fillers, training, some plot, Ecchi scenes and just over stretching the story without trying to make it any more enjoyable or complex, I would say it&#039;s at most a 7.

    Here they come again, the Pantsu Witches.<br />
<br />
So, this is the anime about an alternative history world, which alternative historicity consists in the fact that nobody ever developed something like skirts or women’s trousers there. Alas, poor Scotsmen, they never got their trademark clothes. (Actually I know that it is not skirt but kilt, so don’t throw your bagpipes at me, please. I’m just playing on stereotypes here.)<br />
<br />
And now seriously. The first season was pretty nice. So nice that Japanese Ministry of Culture considered it as one of the best anime shows of the year. With all that success and cliffhanger at the end of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31022">
        last episode it was evident for the second Strike Witches to arrive. However, the title was transferred from Gonzo to AIC, but that didn’t change anything important.<br />
<br />
Once again Witches 2 has poor excuse for a plot. Alien bad guys are still fighting the Earth just because; the 501st Joint Fighter Wing is repelling their attacks thanks to cool invention made by professor to be missing; and even the cliffhanger from the end of the first season has very, very little significance. This is the same old story which became a cliché around 80s or so. To be fair, thanks to it Witches has some nostalgic flavour, because I watched a lot of shows of this type back when I was a kid. Well, the plot in Witches 2 isn’t bad or something, it’s just a decoration for the strongest point of the series: the characters.<br />
<br />
We have moe girls here. They eat, take a bath, fight enemies, talk about friendship and save each other’s lives. Yep, that is simple, cute and sounds stupid, but that is the thing which made this show attractive. No, I don’t mean interesting — “attractive” is the most suitable word here. It’s just simple, relaxing and funny anime, which is not even pretending to have deep philosophy, cunning plot twists and other mind fare — direct hit for recreation. Some character development here, some humorous moments there, then sprinkle it with fanservice — and here you are, enjoyable series presented on a silver plate.<br />
<br />
And concerning the fanservice. It maybe irritating at first, but since it’s the second season we’re talking about, I assume that you, guys, are got used to it already. Yeah, there is a bloody overdose of pantsu shots, enough to send the whole legion of those basement-dwelling otaku into the sea of ecstasy, but it’s too much for anime neophyte’s inexperienced eye to stand. Tastes differ though.<br />
<br />
On a technical level all is okay. Art is detailed and well-drawn. The ships can look plastic, but making all that guns, ropes and fancy gadgets is very serious business, so I don’t have a right to complain about it. As for music, it sounds as cheerful and upbeat as it should be, so it suits Witches 2 well.<br />
<br />
The overall score is seven points, one point lower than I gave to the first season. The reason for it is that Witches stagnated. No major changes were done by AIC, they simply used the channel created by Gonzo in the first season. The plus for it is that they didn’t screw up this anime, but reverse effect is that the show which doesn’t change will eventually become boring. If there will be any third season, I don’t want it to be done that way.<br />
<br />
And yeah, that little creature who was with Miyafuji in the OVA, but not in first Witches… It didn’t showed up here either, so I found myself tricked. Hmph.

    Damn! After watching the last two Episodes of Strike Witches 2 I really want to give it an 8 or even a 9. However, when I think back to all the Episodes before that it wouldn&#039;t represent my feelings about the whole second series.<br />
<br />
After watching the first series, the second one started off great. I mean, the idea of the Neuroi coming back over Romagna/Venezia was pretty simple and expected but the first episodes were still a great introduction into the second series. The characters you love are back and they all get some great moments, especially Major Sakamoto, my favorite! <br />
<br />
Nothing has really changed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review141139">
        compared with the first series: the Art ist maybe a tiny bit more refined and elaborated but nothing big. Some of the major themes of the first series reappear, the new opening and ending were also good though I feel like I the first two were a little bit catchier ;)<br />
Characters are still the same and what you loved about them in the first series is all there. You could criticise the lack of any real development but if you ask me, that&#039;s not really something to expect of this series and that&#039;s fine.<br />
<br />
Now to the reason why my rating for enjoyment/story is at 7/6. After the strong start the series really drops into a hole of fanservice and filler episodes, only to reemerge in the end. <br />
Pretty much all the episodes in between have something happening in and around the Strike Witches base, always with the goal of showing as many scenes with as little clothing as possible. On top of that stuff like naked breasts is censored in the second series, while there was no such thing in the first. Even though I don&#039;t care much for the ecchi parts I feel like the bright beams of light covering everything now make these scenes even cheesier! They all feel forced and badly made up, a thing I also didn&#039;t notice in the first series. The basic pattern is always the same: something unimportant/weird happening, some commotion, maybe a Neuroi appearing at some point for the sake of a quick and generic fight scene and then the resolution of everything. Nothing gained, no story development - I had to force myself to watch these episodes and even thought about quitting the series. That&#039;s not even fanservice any more, that&#039;s merely poor writing and a lack of ideas.<br />
<br />
Anyways, as mentioned before, the series won me back in the end. It miraculously reemerged with an exciting and well written conclusion to the series. The only thing left to ask is: why weren&#039;t they able to do it like that right away? I get that there might not have been much room for new story left in the basic premise of the series, but a shorter series or even a movie right away might have been the way to go there.

    This review will be short and sweet...or at least I&#039;ll try to make it that way ;D<br />
<br />
Strike Witches 2 was a pretty good show. <br />
<br />
Story - 8<br />
It&#039;s pretty much the same as the prequel, the only difference is Romania is taken over this time, there are a few new tricks, and even though there is some fan service, it&#039;s not as much as before (just the same old pantie shots and a few buttocks).Also, you see a few new faces, but really, the story flows pretty similar too this 1st.<br />
<br />
Art - 9<br />
Same old same old. I did like the end of the battle scene though

          <span style="display: none;" id="review100059">
        :)<br />
<br />
Sound - 8<br />
Same everything. I liked the music though :)<br />
<br />
Character - 8<br />
Same everything. Even the new faces act and look like characters we already know. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 8<br />
It was fun. Not as fun as the prequel, since we new everyone already (so it wasn&#039;t much character development).<br />
<br />
Overall - 8<br />
It was a fun story. I think it was better in some ways than the prequel, but overall, I think I liked the prequel a little better. If there was a different plot or something, then maybe the sequel would have taken the prize. Anywho, if you liked the 1st season, then you should definitely give the second a try!<br />

    Strike Witches 2 (2010)<br />
<br />
First off towards the end Sakamoto in the shower without her eyepatch showing off her actual face properly with hair down was absolutely superb. Not as perfect as Sanya but still the second place has been taken. <br />
<br />
A direct continuation of the scenes previously which was nicely linked if you watch Brave Witches after season 1 and its OVA to then get to this season afterwards. The worldbuilding is therefore amazing. The story has the same essential narrative but in a different place with a different base but the same ecchi that we love to see as usual. Bath scenes top scorers

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337425">
        too. <br />
<br />
The art this time around was as expected from the series in that it is more polished but then the time has progressed since the last time. <br />
<br />
Sound does a great job with aircraft noise. Voices are great and general sounds especially that of the enemy fits greatly. <br />
<br />
Characters develop more than ever with this since we know most of them pretty well already. You get a much deeper look into many of them with the introduction of some new faces also.<br />
<br />
I did really enjoy this season and it was a great ending. If no more content chronologically had been produced after this point it would have still made sense and could have ended nicely. I am glad it did not end, however. The people behind the naming of swords need to be chatted too, I get a theme here with anime and weapon names. <br />
<br />
One thing that was interesting to see towards the last few episodes was the realisation the witches got from higher-ups that not everyone sees the witches as the be-all and end-all of the weapons to be used. It was nice to see the development of technology actually make progress as shown. Also seeing the witches brought down to earth a bit from a higher status. <br />
<br />
In the end, absolutely watch this and keep following through the series.

    After defeating the Neuroi in Gallia in the first series, the 501st Strike Witches wing is disbanded. However, after a failed &quot;communication&quot; with the Neuroi in Romanga (Italyish), a new, more menacing Neuroi shows up; and our 501st wing is reassembled to deal with this new threat.<br />
<br />
Strike Witches 2 follows a very similar arrangement to the first series. While lacking in any real plot innovation, it expands on character development and adds some traditional &quot;necessities&quot; such as a beach episode. If you liked the first season despite its lackluster plot, you probably enjoyed the character interactions. If that is the case then this series is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review212141">
        for you. If you found the first series too ecchi, too boring, or just unorganized, you&#039;ll find more of the same here.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
I think they upped the animation budget for this sequel. Within the first five minutes, you can tell that more attention has been given to the battle scenes and the choreography. The overall animation style is identical to the first series, the only major change being that the setting has moved to the Mediterranean. My version this time was not the DVD release so there were lots of god rays. There is still significant CGI, especially towards the end of the series and with the Neuroi, but overall it isn&#039;t too distracting.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The OP is a refreshing mix that I find superior to the original&#039;s OP. The ED reminds me way too much of the ED to Infinite Stratos, though in this case Infinte Stratos is still better. Overall, they both fit the theme and mood of the series quite well. The BGM is similar to the first series with a heavy focus on military drums and orchestral instruments. The VAs are the same as the original series. As certain episodes focus on certain Witches, particularly those that didn&#039;t get much attention in the first series, the air time of the VAs differs significantly from the first series.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story follows almost an identical path to the first series. The series starts and finishes with a plot focus but has lots of episodic episodes in the middle exploring character relations and histories. Like the first series, the ending is a rushed and pretty hilariously bad climax.<br />
<br />
What bothered me the most was that a lot of unanswered questions that I had from the first series (that I hoped would be answered) were not. The only one that is really explored in depth is the origin of the name &quot;witches&quot;. Men are also portrayed in a slightly negative way in the series, like the first series. Either they are the useless people manning ships destined for destruction, or are mysterious military big-wigs that seem more focused on political impression than the loss of their men or witches. In summary, don&#039;t expect much in this department.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Character interactions, if anything are even better in this series. Whereas Miyafuji spent the first series getting familiar to the other witches, now we see them interacting like normal friends. We also see a lot more of the personalities of some of the witches that were somewhat &quot;shelved&quot; in the first series. While there isn&#039;t a terrible amount of actual development, seeing how their different personalities mesh was quite enjoyable, though mind some interactions are borderline yuri.<br />
<br />
Value:<br />
Overall, I felt that the second series carried the spirit of the first series fairly well. Despite the impracticality of the final arc and the lackluster continuity, the character interactions were fun, thus making this a series you can safely watch one episode at a time. As with the first series, you won&#039;t be dying for fan service after this watch.

    This review contains spoilers.<br />
<br />
The primary selling point of the entire Strike Witches series is Yoshika flying into a Neuroi attack against impossible odds. As I&#039;ve written in my review for the first season, it worked so well it got parodied in other series.<br />
<br />
My main beef with the franchise is the fact that someone high up (probably Shimada) decided that there shall be no Pacific theater in this war, despite all the opportunities to respectfully dramatize the historical Pacific theater. (A minor complaint I also have is Funimation&#039;s/Wikia&#039;s translations of military ranks; there are no &quot;Majors&quot; in the navy, nor should everyone just default to RAF

          <span style="display: none;" id="review288652">
        ranks.)<br />
<br />
Towards the conclusion of season 1, there was a little plot element involving Yoshika and the Neuroi that was really interesting to me, in addition to being a pivotal plot device revealing the mustache-twirling villain I mentioned in my review of season 1. I&#039;m talking, of course, about the Neuroi &quot;witch&quot; that suggested the Neuroi are capable of communication with humans and want to interact. This gave the Neuroi a surprising amount of depth, making them more than faceless villains who shoot up humans with red laser beams. Additionally, there was a powerful element of suspense when Yoshika reached out to the &quot;witch&quot;-- would the &quot;witch&quot; accept her, or consume her?<br />
<br />
So, naturally, the production team decided to eliminate this strain of Neuroi with another one that apparently wants all humans exterminated. I really detest dramatic writing that just deletes prior plot elements like this, because (a) it flattened the antagonist, which made it far less interesting, and (b) it made the writing easier, but far more lazy-- it&#039;s the exact same stench of retconning. Sure, it got wrapped into a prologue that dramatically ends, &quot;Operation Trajan has failed. I repeat, Operation Trajan has failed,&quot; but the more I think on it, the less I like it. There are rare occasions where an antagonist is best written as a flat character of sorts (kinda like PvE games), but as a rule of thumb it is better to write them with some depth and complexity.<br />
<br />
After that prologue, season 2 is largely a carbon copy of season 1 but with the added twist that Mio is losing her powers. So it&#039;s basically continuing where season 1 left off, with a bigger finale involving the battleship Yamato because Japanese production, capping it off with Yoshika doing the Japanese equivalent of a joust-- so not overused in 80% of action anime. /sarcasm<br />
<br />
The episodes between the prologue and the final mission are fun overall, and yet it&#039;s just like season 1: Cute girls doing cute things with machine guns and without skirts. We do get to see development of all the members of the 501st, so that&#039;s nice.<br />
<br />
There are added tracks to the audio, though the only one I can recognize consistently is the BGM to the prologue. The opening theme I like better in season 2 than season 1, and the ending is meh. Because the soundtrack builds upon the BGM for season 1, the audio is naturally fantastic.<br />
<br />
So it&#039;s a bigger production than season 1, but that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s a better one.

    If you&#039;ve just finished the first season or are just reading the reviews for future seasons including this one on whether or not you want to watch this series you have to ask yourself these important questions and if you have any biases. Does a show have to have meaningful plot? Is fanservice a deal breaker to you the viewer?<br />
<br />
If you answered YES to any of those questions then chances are you are unlikely to enjoy Strike Witches as a series because to be blunt and to the point the plot from here on out has as much imagination as the clothes the girls wear.<br />
<br />
Does

          <span style="display: none;" id="review398693">
        mean the series is bad from S2 onwards? Not necessarily because as said before that depends on whether you have internal biases or not. Personally for me the show is surprisingly enjoyable when you can watch it for the characters and the neuori dog fights and you don&#039;t look too deep into things. Theres plenty of good moments between the girls like Barkhorn and Hartmann for example and the girls are quite likeable.
