    This anime is something. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s a remarkable originallity on it, but, at the same time, it feels a bit nostalgic. Appare Ranman has quite a strange plot, its _bizarreness_ isn&#039;t something your average anime has. <br />
<br />
Its characters are unique, and, at the same time, clichè. Appare is an aphathetic boy, but really gifted. His companion, Kosame, is loud and a complete opposite of Appare. Their relationship develops in a strange yet hillarious way, making the anime more enjoyable. <br />
<br />
The art and the sound, the &quot;creativeness&quot; of all of it. Frantically exposing its own weirdness. Yeah, im quite amazed by how enjoyable and funny all of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349723">
        it is, and they are yet to start the Race! <br />
<br />
Appare Ranman is a gem of this year, i&#039;m happy it&#039;s back! <br />

9/10 till now.

    Jojo&#039;s Steam Ball Run: the Animation, that is yet unfortunately another COVID-delayed show.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s hard to believe that this one show that&#039;s full of experimental creativeness and perceived notion is all conceived by one man alone: Masakazu Hashimoto. From the story to the series composition that&#039;s tons of wacked insanity, it&#039;s more than enough to stand out in its originality, yet also be a callback to his career days of starting out as a director over at P.A. Works circa. 2011 (after flailing around from different anime projects in the 2000s with varying degrees of success). His first directorial and series composition work being Tari Tari

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357390">
        way back in 2012 wasn&#039;t game-changing, but the way that it was done certainly had the early otakus take notice of his idea of a unique storytelling that&#039;s totally Hashimoto&#039;s: a fairly simple tried-and-true story plot, but with a pinch of inspiration to carve out its own identity and stand out as so. But as is with HaruChika&#039;s somewhat odd approach and consequence of people attacking him (as the director) vs. the novelist that has somewhat of a mish-mash of ideas that are not put well together, it&#039;s sad to say that it was kinda a defining moment of unnecessary hate strewn from that.<br />
<br />
But now, after some time, Hashimoto is back with a story setting about a cross-country race that spans cities and people from the East to the West within a 19th century modernized Wild Wild West take, and it&#039;s honestly a thrill to follow the many characters who have defied dangers whilst participating in unforeseen deathmatches, fighting to save theirs and others&#039; precious lives from time to time. &quot;It&#039;s a strange world&quot; as the quotes say, with the bombastic bizarreness of a plot and setting that only complete once they are joined together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who says death-defying races are just for the Americans, both locally and natively?&quot; This is a question that always pops up in my mind about people from different cultures entering into another culture, and totally getting that &quot;culture shock&quot; factor, and that is exactly what the 2 main characters are here for: the &quot;Alexander Graham-Bell&quot; of big-ass inventions of a dreamer that is Sorano Appare, and the skilled coward of a samurai who needs to pluck his courage, Kosame Isshiki. The idea of steamships in the 19th Century was a thing when transportation was getting ready to ship the masses across vast distances, and with Appare enamored at the idea of it, he so desperately wanted to create one for himself. Fortunately (or unfortunately), the playful strings of &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; landed both Kosame and Appare in another continent (that is the U.S. of Los Angeles) and a particular race (of which the prize money won will be used back to Japan) sets the both of them on a course that will teach each other about camaraderie, and the dependence that will prove to be both MC&#039;s biggest character tonal shifts from time to time.<br />
<br />
A &quot;Trans-America Wild (car) Race&quot; that&#039;s sponsored by organizers of big coporations who call themselves B.I.G. Boss (that you can see where the inspiration when it comes to automobiles), and within it, an assassination plot of the most mind-numbing kind that only weaves its unwelcoming stance the more is revealed...that suddenly isn&#039;t so much of a race anymore against rivals, but a fight to the death with a group of bandits wreaking havoc all around. Simple and overly cliche, but it works as a final product altogether.<br />
 <br />
To properly understand this show in general, there are many characters that play a part in this expedition:<br />
- The Appare-Kosame team of an unusual steam-powered car, along with Hototo, a &quot;Red Indian&quot;-ish native American of a child, whose gain is to seek revenge for a gang that killed his tribe and family after being rescued from thugs.<br />
- Jing Xialian, an assistant for a racing team that is constantly being accused and judged by her gender in an all-male society, and her #MeToo statement being a forthcoming judgment to see her in a totally different light, that women can also be like men and race wild.<br />
- Al Lyon and Sofia Taylor, potential family heir and the heir&#039;s chaperone of one of the B.I.G. Boss corporations (BNW), with a desire to win to prove his solidarity and firmness of being his family&#039;s next in-line to the corporation.<br />
- Race organizer Seth Rich Carter (you can call him Mr. Carter), whom has been ridiculed in the past as an engineer for another B.I.G. Boss corporation (G.M.), but like Kosame, holed up due to cowardice and not being able to stand up for himself.<br />
- The Bad Brothers Tristan and Chase, whom like native Hototo, are burly Americans but whom first came under the wrong impressions, and are some of the kindest characters in the series.<br />
- Last but not least, the &quot;Thousand Three&quot; outlaws which form the basis of B.I.G. Boss: skilled gunmen Dylan G. Oldin (racing for G.M), &quot;Crazy&quot; TJ (racing for Iron Motor Company) and the leader of the bandits Richard &quot;Gil (the Snake) T. Cigar&quot; Reeseman (lone driver).<br />
<br />
All characters get their lone times of character development, which is to say that for 13 episodes of a shit-ton of concurrent events happening at different times, every character has their definite background moments to shine their light and shoot over the moon. Take Appare and Kosame for example: Appare is like a gifted bookworm, very focused on what he needs to do and forgets about the outside world instantly, while Kosame is loud and obnoxious, with a clear reason for his vengeance and redemption as the series progresses, both characters shrug each other off at the very beginning, but the apparent figures of simultaneous events that force them to double-team up and understand each other&#039;s motivation is always nice, and it only gets better from there on. Needless to say, the character department will be one of Appare-Ranman!&#039;s stronger aspects when considering about the final product (which is the show itself in full glory).<br />
<br />
P.A. Works is NO stranger to original shows in the past few years, but the records have been few and far in-between if there is any level of hype to back it up. Of course, this show had it in the Spring season, but the COVID push-back of a seasonal delay definitely hurt the enjoyment more (of people forgetting that it exists, DUH). It was a constant treat to see the art and animation show its legs, and even with some CGI (on the race), it will not win any awards, but at least it&#039;ll get the race done and dealt with. Overall, I&#039;d never think to see 19th Century America so well-thought out, even resembling with the Wild Wild West of olden days past with a good sprinkle of animation to accompany it.<br />
<br />
The OST, well oh well, it had a very nostalgic feel to it...that&#039;s if you feel inclined about 19th Century worldly standards. A good job on taking what is already well known and putting a nostalgic spin on it, kudos for setting the appropriate atmosphere for what it is. Good pairing of the OP and ED, and YES, finally a good song from Mia REGINA that screams &quot;I don&#039;t give a F***&quot; at how balls-off-the-wall the series has been flexing its personality. Long-time veteran Shoutarou Morikubo with his ED is also a good way to finish each episode, and anticipating what&#039;s to come, step-by-step. Truly the &quot;I&#039;ve got it!&quot;A-HA moment.<br />
<br />
The above-average spectrum of P.A. Works&#039;s catalogue of original shows, and watching people do what they love is a nice gesture, on top of just going bonkers and sticking lackluster endings of the shows gone by. At most this was a passion project done pretty good (not great, but passable), but at least I enjoyed my run with this show.<br />
<br />
Now if you&#039;d excuse me, I must now muster my creativity to make my own dream automobile and enter the race of a &quot;lifetime&quot;.

    Another season. Another good original work anime by P.A works. This time it comes in the form of a racing anime. Appare-Ranman is different from anything I&#039;ve ever seen. From the character designs to the actual plot of the show, nobody can say it&#039;s generic at all. The closest comparison I could think of for Appare-Ranman is around the world in 30 days. It&#039;s a wild, wacky and entertaining journey with Appare and co. as they race from LA to NY for prize money to return home to Japan. Unfortunately, things aren&#039;t as smooth sailing as they&#039;d like.<br />
<br />
Unlike Fairy Gone, which I love, Appare-Ranman has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357417">
        some solid CG. One of the biggest complaints about P.A works last show was the subpar CGI, convoluted plot, direction, etc. All of those were improved upon massively here. While I didn&#039;t enjoy Appare as much as FG, objectively it has better quality production.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s rather sad that the show was postponed due to COVID a few months ago, it took a lot of wind out of its sails and led to it being criminally slept on as people forgot it really existed. That said, I&#039;m glad I was one of the few to watch this show, it really is unique and entertaining. I know those phrases get thrown around a lot, but I&#039;m confident you&#039;ll find enjoyment from this one.<br />
<br />
Appare-Ranman gets 8(insert something catchy from the show) out of 10 from me.

    What I didn&#039;t like about this anime,<br />
<br />
I will start with the major con I have with this anime. There are many anime with the over-powered main character, viewer watches those anime for How the MC defeats or overcomes the hurdle? rather than does he actually able to overcome it. There can be many ways to show the characters are intelligent. Minor spoiler:The Main character(Appare) within a split second can calculate the objects trajectories and able to escape, in one scene. If it is limited to the MC (Appare) itself it would have been okay. The other main character (Kosame) able to split the bullet in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357427">
        to half with a sword with no logic is certainly a big plot hole for me.If they wanted to keep it close to natural,they should haven&#039;t shown those scenes, my experience could have been a much better, it was too hard to ignore. They didn&#039;t even try to cover it with some power (I can understand,if they did it would have been even worse). Kosame backstory became so cliche (used in almost 5-6 episodes) and I absolutely hated the way it is presented. The ending could have been better.I didn&#039;t even realized that this has a comedy tag.I what-so-ever didnt even get a giggle out of my face while watching this anime <br />
<br />
What I liked about this anime is, <br />
<br />
The Art its so refreshing to see the characters shown this way. The sound Jass is good, the character development is good with no fan service(Thank you). The way it tackles the gender equality and the equality between people of different location and social status (which is subtle but still) is very good. I enjoyed the starting 7-8 episodes wholeheartedly<br />
<br />
<br />
TL;DR<br />
Story:7<br />
Art:7<br />
Sound:7<br />
Character :7<br />
Enjoyment : 5 (ruined by last 5 episodes)<br />
Overall : 6.5 /10 <br />
<br />

    Do I recommend this series? Yes, I recommend this a lot.<br />
<br />
Appare Ranman deserved so much more attention and love. If this anime didn&#039;t get delayed and cut into pieces by COVID 19, this could have been the biggest spring anime this year. <br />
<br />
[Main review]<br />
Do you want to see a samurai race across America with a native-american boy? Do you want to see the boundaries of racing pushed? Do you want to see cool engineering and masterminds fight? Do you just want speed? If so this is the perfect anime for you. Completely unique, original, well animated, and most importantly its actually good. <br />
<br />
Story - 7/10<br />
I&#039;m

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349909">
        not sure about you, but this is the first time I&#039;ve seen something like this. I like it. The story is completely new (I think), and for once it&#039;s done correctly. Some animes with new concepts just flop and just become unbearably bad, while others are just generic. This plot might be a little too easy to predict, but I will love seeing this grow bigger. <br />
<br />
Art - 9/10<br />
I like it. I always say no art is bad in my reviews, can I just say the art is really nice this time. The coloring, the character design, the settings. All of those are very distinct. The animation is nice. Done well. Never seen characters so original. <br />
<br />
Sound - 5/10<br />
Honestly as long it is in sync, not too cringy, and sound good I don&#039;t really care. Who even judges animes by the music? I can assure you the intro is pretty good.<br />
<br />
Characters - 4/10<br />
Besides from the art quality, man its shallow. Not much characteristic, not very unique. There is the smart one, the girl, the rival, the funny sidekick, and the invis support sidekick. Did I basically describe all the characters in the series? Yea, I guess. <br />
<br />
 Enjoyment - 6/10<br />
I could have enjoyed it so much more if the pace was a little faster. 6/10 isn&#039;t bad, I just have high standards. <br />
<br />
Overall - 7/10<br />
Doing the thing you love and is good at is always fun. Watching something new being made is always fun. This anime was good, could have done so much better, at least it tried and didn&#039;t flop. Keep in mind I never said it was bad. <br />

    Samurai Like Speed Too<br />
Appare-Ranman! focuses on a weird engineer Appare Sorano and a clever, yet timid samurai Kosame Isshiki. The two need to compete in the Trans-America Wild Race to win the prize and to return back home to Japan. The duo will face many outlaws and madmen during the race. Will they return back home safe and sound?<br />
<br />
Appare Ranman is weird looking characters and supercars, many puns and a comedy that is quite unique and funny. Basically, there is an automobile race from Los Angeles to New York, and there are many people from all the parts of the world, willing to take part

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357389">
        in the said race. Some want the fame, some are just crazy for speed and cannot live without that daily portion of adrenaline, some, however, are just too poor to return to their homeland and need the prize to return home. But this might be wrong for Sorano Appare, because he is an engineer that does not like to concede. Long story short, the storyline gives all the needed hints: it explains why the two need to participate in the race and it also gives all the needed background of the protagonists. That said, the storyline does its work well, however, my only problem is that it lacks a grain of uniqueness to make it stand out. <br />
<br />
Animation wise, it is quite catchy. It might be somewhat difficult to come up with the art that will be unique in 2020, but Appare Ranman does manage to do it: every single car has its own unique flair that demonstrates the drivers’ personality, character designs look unique and memorable and, of course, the background looks cool, too, depicting Feudal Japan and the old version of America. <br />
<br />
Character wise, this is where this series shines quite bright, I must say. Appare is your typical anime genius: he is a genius engineer, he can make a car out of literally nothing, however, he is terrible when it comes to communicating with other people. This is quite what we have seen many times, the difference, however, is that Appare does not care that much about being the best and trying to make other people understand that he is superior to others, all he wants is to live his life as an engineer and he is just fed up with the people, telling him what to do. Next comes the clever, yet timid samurai Kosame Isshiki. He is a low-ranked government official, who lived in the same town as Sorano Appare. The two end up in an absolutely unfamiliar land, with its own customs and people that are quite different from what Appare and Isshiki have ever known and they now need to work together, in order for them to succeed. <br />
<br />
Criticism<br />
While I did say that the storyline lacks originality, it still is very enjoyable nevertheless. I have not said anything about the supporting characters, too, which is another problem this series has; they could have received more development. Yet again, this is a story of Kosame Isshiki and Sorano Appare, so while the supporting characters are needed, they do not need to get that much of a screen  time, so it is fine. <br />
<br />
With that being said, Appare Ranman is a pure fun to watch. It is made for your enjoyment and the fans of car racing series will surely appreciate Appare Ranman’s take on it. I do admit that this series has quite a sloooow start, but it becomes much better, if you give it a chance. Of course, not a masterpiece, but it deserves a portion of your free time.

    There is a lot to be said about this show, for a lot of good reasons then bad. <br />
<br />
First let&#039;s get to the world the show is in. It&#039;s that desert sort of oldie wild west feel, which also feels steampunk like in a few parts. Which looks really great honestly, as the art style and music really fit both of these themes, and are really good in general. A major plus if you&#039;re into those themes, but also for the anime itself.<br />
<br />
Second so far, the characters. There are a lot of relatable characters in the show, mainly from their personalities and backgrounds. But also

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349715">
        just a likeable cast in general, with how they interact with one another, with how the story goes at least. Along with the chemistry with other characters. Just looking at our two MCs as an example, they really fit and mesh together well, and some of the moments so far are quite a laugh.<br />
<br />
Each character has fun and interesting backgrounds of how they all came here too. Sure some are quite heart wrenching or depressing, but they&#039;re still strong characters, even with all that.<br />
<br />
The story itself seems rather interesting! A big race that we&#039;re all just dying to see. Just reminds me of that Tom and Jerry race movie, and that was great, and so far this has been too! I&#039;d honestly give this a watch if you wanted to pick it up.

    Appare-Ranma! it is an anime very difficult to describe because he does not go to an exact destination, the anime does not want to do just one thing. It is a crazy running anime, a thematically inclusive anime and an anime that develops very interesting internal dramas, but nothing said connects very well, there is not a 100% well-connected connection to work on all these amazing themes, however, that doesn’t is a problem, put anime decides to work all this in a very peculiar and fun way.<br />
<br />
Perhaps that is the word that defines this anime so well, its peculiarity. It&#039;s in everything: in cars; in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361663">
        the characters; in the city; in the historical context and also in the plot. He doesn&#039;t follow a line that goes linearly throughout the anime, he doesn&#039;t go from point A to B like a Mad Max; Fury Road for example, he has his stops, he brakes and moves the pace in a very confused way, the characters should be doing one thing, when they are doing something completely out of the curve and it is still good. Perhaps the great reason for this lack of discomfort with elements that should be treated as problems in other animes gains a lot of strength here put the anime ties it all up in a very new and inventive way. But yes, does he have any facilities or generic choices to keep the story going? it certainly has, but the way it is staged does not. The choices, even if they are made and pointed to a path that will obviously conclude, are executed in a way that always seeks novelty. The anime does not let the viewer try to anticipate what will happen because it is presented to us in a very thought-provoking way, it is really concerned with trying to establish a link between this peculiar construction with all elements of the work directly with the viewer.<br />
<br />
Appare-Ranman! is an anime that will use several conventions already seen in other anime in an always renewed and unique way within its own construction.

    A pretty average anime, through and through.<br />
<br />
I can’t say that this anime does anything new, but it does most of it decently well. The premise of a cross-country race will bring to mind Steel Ball Run or Death Race, but believe me, it is much more toothless than any of those stories.<br />
<br />
That is probably my biggest gripe with this anime. I don’t care too much if an anime is not supper original, as long as it is well-executed and enjoyable I’m a happy camper. But when you make an anime about a cross-country race in early 1900s America with ruthless outlaws, there needs to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357553">
        some stakes.<br />
<br />
If this anime just wanted to be a fun time, then just make have the entire plot being about the actual race. Don’t half commit to an outlaw plot just so you can do a poor Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven immitation for a sense of conflict. <br />
<br />
Add on top of that the swift conclusion to an outlaw group that was hyped up the entire season and you have an anime that does not know what its stengths and weaknesses are.<br />
<br />
So what are Appare-Ranman’s strengths? <br />
<br />
Well, one thing that the anime does pretty well is creating a fun atmosphere between the characters. Some of the best parts of this anime are when the characters are just interacting with each other. The characters are a melting pot of different cultures and personalities so there are limitless possibilities for how they can interact.<br />
<br />
If the anime would have just focused on the race and the character’s motivations, this anime would have been a lot more focused and enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Nothing else really stands out in this anime. The art is solid except for the occasional bad CGI. The music did not stand out at all. I can’t remember any of its music aside from the OP. The voice acting was pretty standard, the villian overacted a bit on occasion but in general it was fine. <br />
<br />
There really isn’t much special about this anime. I was surprised that I was even able to write as much as I did about it. If you watch it, you won’t hate it, but you may not remember it.<br />
<br />
It’s closer to a 6 than a 4.

    This show is a victim of the covid shuffle, airing 3 episodes before being halted... during which it rightful made waves...and then it was forgotten about. <br />
It re-aired in July to a chorus of tumbleweed.... wild west pun innit. <br />
I literally felt so strongly I made a youtube video about how amazing this anime is and how unfair it is to see it go unloved. <br />
<br />
The strongest points to this anime by far is its characters/ relationships / interactions and building of bonds. Every character grows... every character is explored and developed some more than others...but its enough for us by the time stuff really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354980">
        goes down in ep 8 and 9 ... yes prepare yourself as I don&#039;t think any of us saw that twist....<br />
but by this point you will feel something. <br />
<br />
The next point I really want to praise is the art/ the shadow and use of light/ there are some beautiful scenes in this anime... the art style took some getting use to. But by the time we get some beautiful misty mornings/ sun shining through trees and shadows.... I was on board.<br />
<br />
The plot itself is straightforward enough. Through a series of mishaps Appare and Kosame  two Japanese characters...end up in turn of the century LA. <br />
They have no money to their names and Appare is a wacky out there mechanic...they see the Trans atlantic race is about to happen with a sum of money as a reward and booom plot is in motion....however what I wasn&#039;t expecting was a whirl wind of emotions that followed. <br />
The plot initially seemed boring to me... but I was wrong.<br />
The race is just a driving force.... haha car pun.... it moves the characters forward...however along the way there are obstacles to over come and feels to feel.<br />
<br />
I dont write reviews until the end credit has rolled. But because no one is talking about this anime... I made the choice to write it early.<br />
<br />
If you have an interest in - steampunk/ wild west/ cars or the dying samurai way ...this anime may be for you....<br />
Also because hes mentioned nowhere in the cast...or wasn&#039;t when I made the video....Kenshiro Tsuada is literally killing it this season as the evil shark from GOH and now hes terrorizing the west. The voice talent in this show is amazing. <br />
Its funny/ sad/ interesting and at times clever ....this anime deserves to be on your watch list!!!

    Steam punk  modified to a 20th century era themed, not bad at all.<br />
<br />
So: <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Pros: As an original work of studio &quot;PA Works&quot; it wasn&#039;t bad at all when it has a combination of  the following: the setting of &quot;Wild Wild West,&quot; The comedy of &quot;Wacky Races&quot; and a couple of &quot;Fast and Furious&quot; action, all rolled into one.<br />
<br />
Cons: IMAO, nothing bad about this original anime&#039;s story plot.<br />
<br />
Verdict (8 over 10)<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: <br />
<br />
Pros: None of that Xialian and Sofia&#039;s fanservice.....<br />
<br />
Cons: Ok , there was that Sofia&#039;s underwear service , but it&#039;s of 1910&#039;s era, so not hot in a sense. <br />
<br />
Verdict (4 over 10)<br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
<br />
Pros:

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357529">
        Good Opening theme &quot;I got it!&quot; by Mia REGINA and ending theme &quot;I&#039;m Nobody&quot; by Shoutarou Morikubo....<br />
<br />
Cons: Nothing to mentioned.<br />
<br />
Verdict (7 over 10)<br />
<br />
Character<br />
<br />
Pros: The Kosame and Appare relationship where at first they started off on the wrong side of the bed , cu&#039;z Appare is a free thinker who often does a lotta trouble in the name of science and Kosame who is suppose to put hi behind bars but gets out witted. In the end by some freak accident the 2 found themselves in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, where they were rescued by a ship bound to the USA, from there they have to find a way to live in that new place and yes it entering that race that would serve as their ticket for the two to go their separate ways since the two don&#039;t want to have to do with each other , that&#039;s it as soon as Appare comes up with some ways to make a something they can use to race and win. Hototo, comes in and he basically serves as a binder of the two given that he knows the back country&#039;s of the USA ......Xialan , serves as this anime&#039;s gender equality character where she is presented as not just a girl who not only can race but also can kick ass as well, TBFH, I only mentioned them since they&#039;re the ones who made an impact to this anime&#039;s overall enjoyment....<br />
<br />
<br />
Cons: Gil T Cigar was just too much of an overrated antagonist that he has to be the BIG BAD GUY that has to be super good that it has to take 7 to tire him out and 2 to take him out. <br />
<br />
Verdict (8 over 10)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
Pros: Not a chore to watch.<br />
<br />
Cons: ________________<br />
<br />
Verdict (8 over 10)<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Verdict (9 over 10)<br />
<br />
Kudos to studio &quot;PA Works&quot; and Original Anime Director, Hashimoto Masakazu.....Well worth it.

    &quot;Eccentric genius&quot; gets &quot;coincidentally&quot; paired with a &quot;normal&quot; man that acts as both a chaperone and a straight man to the genius. I wonder where I heard of this plot idea before?<br />
<br />
Appare-Ranman takes a classic trope and tries to run off with it. There&#039;s so much rushed pacing and irregularities in the plot in order for the story to progress as fast as possible. You don&#039;t get to see any of the character interactions go beyond a surface level. Before you know it, the story progresses and new, random characters get thrown into the mix in order for there to be more diversity. It&#039;s pretty

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376275">
        clear that Appare-Ranman is a story-centric show that uses characters as a mean to make the story happen. It doesn&#039;t even try to hide how bad the pilot episode is because it&#039;s a mere way for the actual story to come into play. Right from the start we get the very obvious plot devices that get spam thrown at the viewer. Appare is a &quot;eccentric genius&quot; that likes to tinker with gadgets, is unsociable and unpredictable, and our other main character, Kosame is forced to keep watch over our character. In no more than a single episode we get the common tropes thrown at Appare. He gets berated by his father for not having a proper job, he gets into big trouble but is able to get out due to his genius intelligence, and he doesn&#039;t think about the consequences of his actions because there are none, no matter how severe it actually is. Why? Because our boy Appare is the main character with plot armor given by the gods. Anything and everything he does goes his way no matter what. Kosame&#039;s just a character to keep Appare &quot;in check&quot; and a &quot;normal&quot; character to be a contrast with Appare, making a &quot;dynamic duo.&quot;<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a lack of logic in many of the characters and the way they act towards Appare, because if they didn&#039;t do that, he wouldn&#039;t be able to get away with all the things he does. Get stranded? Don&#039;t worry, help comes miraculously. Stand in front of car throttling through at top speed at the dead of night? No worries, Characters get introduced in a similar fashion. Luckily meet the same characters over and over, random scenarios lead them to meet different characters, and they all become great friends after interacting for a few minutes even though they were complete strangers just before. Then, they obviously have to spew their entire life sob story in front of Appare and Kosame, where then they will become a side character that will help the duo in some way shape or form. Appare&#039;s eccentric and life threatening actions would normally kill or jail a person immediately, but his smarts and plot armor seem to make his actions without consequence.<br />
<br />
And the story? Win a million dollars in a race to go back home to Japan. You&#039;d think that for a story that cuts corners in every way shape or form, this would be some sort of psychological thriller that needs to be paced this way, or nothing would be done. No...in the end it&#039;s the most simple racing show there is. Seriously, this story was so rushed in the beginning, for what? Some simple racing game? Was there really no better way to introduce the main plot? The only thing that this show focuses on is the racing aspect, I guess. It really makes me wonder why there had to be such an elaborate concept for such a simple plot. Redline was able to do that in 2 hours, so why wasn&#039;t Appare Ranman in 4?<br />
<br />
Characters that are thrown in and introduced within minutes in order to progress plot don&#039;t appeal to me, and nor does this simple story that the plot is trying to get through. The races are the only thing worth noting, but is it worth going through mindless exposition? No. Not at all.

    Appare Ranman is set in the late 19th century where the eccentric Japanese mechanic Appare Sorano and swordsman Kosame Isshiki find themselves in America after the former made a small steamship he intended to use to go on a journey, before Kosame&#039;s meddling led them both to be stranded in the ocean before being saved by a large American steamship. Seeking money to return to Japan, the two enter a race crossing the country from Los Angeles to New York City, with Appare converting the steamship he made into a steam-powered car to compete in it.<br />
<br />
From the looks of things, Appare Ranman appeared to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357488">
        going more for spectacle than any kind of depth with exploring the Trans-America Wild Race that Appare, Kosame, and several other racers wind up participating in. All the characters have their standard character types they follow with a sprinkling of backstory to have reason for them participating in the race, which the first several episodes are focused on dabbling into before the start of the race. Plus, the series seemed to have plenty of anachronisms in accurately depicting the supposed late-19th century setting it has with a number of the cars in the race having more modern designs from the 1920s to 1940s, mention of the Panama Canal which wasn&#039;t completed until 1914, the American flag having 50 stars when much of the Western part of the country were still regarded as territories, and one of the racers appearing to listen to modern rap music in his car radio in spite of said radio not coming around until the 1950s.<br />
<br />
While it may seem like I&#039;m criticizing these points of the series, the spectacle that Appare Ranman has to offer actually works pretty well to its strengths in spite of its obvious hiccups with depth. Appare&#039;s eccentric character is an entertaining one to see with the heavy devotion he has toward building things with his mechanical aptitude and the character chemistry that unfolds between the racers can be entertaining to see at points such as Kosame playing &quot;straight man&quot; to Appare&#039;s behavior and some of the antics that unfold during the show&#039;s breather episode later in the series. Plus being animated by PA Works, the artwork for Appare-Ranman is nice to see in action with some pretty elaborate character designs with some of the racers and fluid animation coming from the racing and action scenes within the series.<br />
<br />
While I could be forgiving toward the anime&#039;s lack of depth as it wasn&#039;t Appare-Ranman&#039;s intended focus, I did take issue with the show&#039;s abrupt addition of an antagonist toward the final four episodes of the series. While the show did foreshadow his presence in earlier episodes, said antagonist only exists to add in a needless conflict into the series that gets in the way of the Trans-Atlantic Wild Race due to his presence in the series and is pretty flat as a character compared to the other colorful personalities seen with the racers.<br />
<br />
In short, Appare-Ranman largely gets by with the spectacle it offers up with its race with its disregard for historical accuracy and its colorful cast of characters. While I&#039;ll admit I was engaged to its racing premise in spite of its issues with depth, the addition of a needless conflict with an antagonist in its final episodes did derail some of the enjoyment I was getting out of the series. As long as you don&#039;t question the particulars of things with Appare-Ranman that it blatantly disregards, it still makes for decent entertainment due to it embracing its spectacle and colorful characters.

    I wish I could say this is the most fun with an anime I’ve had in a long time, and while it’s certainly a watchable show and I would return for a second season, I think it falls short in a few vital areas. <br />
<br />
Before we get there though, how did I feel at the beginning of the show? Here’s a little something I typed out before I was done; <br />
<br />
—<br />
Someone’s view of and time with any piece of media is a deeply subjective, personal experience. Not everything can appeal to everyone. But a story is meant to appeal to someone, teach them something, or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review392584">
        entertain sensibilities maybe only they have. Appare Ranman! is almost exactly that for me, to the point of marking off nearly every checkbox. <br />
<br />
Steampunk? Check. <br />
<br />
Fun opening? Good ending? Great soundtrack overall? Check. <br />
<br />
Unique, eccentric visual artistic design, to the point of turning a time period into a caricature? Check. <br />
<br />
Fantasy racing? Check, check, check. <br />
<br />
But its most important element; a story about someone with a passion, who does everything in his power to live for his passion, carry out his dreams, and achieve his goals. <br />
—<br />
<br />
Sounds good, right? At first, it would look like Appare Ranman! has all of these traits, on top of some really compelling characters; and to some degree, it does. However, it doesn’t take them to the absolute peak of where they could go. If I were to put it into layman’s terms, it has “just enough” originality to make it at least watchable. <br />
<br />
Why does everyone in 1910’s America speak Japanese? Why do the cars look and drive in such a modern way, with headlights and engines and sculpted chassis bodies? Who cares? It’s this part of the story that I find fun, because it doesn’t bore you with a grounded reflection of the time period, it just juggles it into a unique story with a lot of potential. Blended into that story are characters with great designs and worthwhile backstories, but unfortunately not quite enough in the way of plot relevance to truly leave a strong impact. The protagonist is enjoyably awkward, and as I stated above I appreciate stories that involve someone’s passion in their hobby or trade. His companions, Hototo, Kosame, and Xia Lian, are just short of great, with Kosame’s little character arc the standout of them all. However, a little more than halfway through the story, it becomes clear that the racing element of the plot will be sidelined for something a bit more akin to a western, with a traditional conflict embroiled in the violence of villains and heroes. While this is not a bad thing by any means, I had hoped for something more in line with how the series began, and especially something with a more active directing style. Don’t get me wrong, the animation is good, but it also isn’t anything super spectacular or original. It could have benefited from more unique racing scenes and less CG vehicles.<br />
<br />
However, a review is mostly meant to critique what is rather than what is not, so on that note I think it handled most of its weight well enough to make me want to see where it could go next. Was it everything I was hoping for? Sadly, no. But that being said, while it falls short from being a GREAT show it is still a GOOD show, and far above most seasonal anime. If you want flashy colors, fun characters, and a bit of a western/steampunk/neon flair, then Appare Ranman! might just very well be worth your time. <br />

    Appare Ranman is probably one of the greatest anime, ever!! This anime was not what I expected at first, and it&#039;s greatness blew my mind! Every single character is so loveable (except that Gil the Butcher), and the art and animation is purely amazing!!! The story itself is great, and the Intro&#039;s definitely the part of this series that&#039;s gonna be stuck in my head for a loooong time. Some of the parts of the story don&#039;t really stick together though, and there are some flaws in each character&#039;s personalities, which annoyed me from time to time. I&#039;m really gonna miss this anime though, and

    Story: The story starts inducing curiosity and attention over the aesthetic of cars and race and stuff like that. The major problem for me, was in the end when the subplot becomes a major one and the race was left aside for no reason at all. It is a good story, well written, but has problems with what do they want to focus, becoming something more related to action than the race itself (7/10)<br />
<br />
Art: The aesthetic of the characters and the world inserted into the story is very unique and pleasant. They surely take much time on this to be something to be memorable. I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review368728">
        remember when I was studying Creative Writing in college and one of the assets was how giving a visual style that were unique, could drag more attention to your story even if your story wasn&#039;t so good, and the anime follows that rule (8/10)<br />
<br />
Sound: Don&#039;t have much to say about it, because it very generic and doesn&#039;t add to much to determinate scene that maybe should be more emphatic with a proper sound design and editing. It was fair because the visual were the part that they attached to (6/10)<br />
<br />
Character: The protagonists of the story had a very good design but not so much of a good background to follow it. Kosame fails to this rule because he was the best written character and his arc of understanding what is the most important thing for him and his path of the warrior had a good piece of write, but it was also generic and cliché. The major problem with the characters was that had no difference between them and the extras, beside the visual: they could be part on that history as well, but doesn&#039;t fit because they weren&#039;t aesthetic enough (7/10)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: The enjoyment of the anime was good in the first half when they focused the action on the races and the competition itself but as soon they started to follow the subplot of Gil, started to turn into a piece of generic situation and action. I mean, do they really needed an antagonist in this series, besides all the situation they been through? Who knows (6/10)<br />
<br />
Overall: This is a good piece of anime to see expecting nothing about it. They had the chance to make a japanese version of Wacky Races but couldn&#039;t because of that subplot involving Gil. I wouldn&#039;t recommend this to anyone unless they want to see something different or visual pleasant. It&#039;s good to watch in binge watching or drinking with friends

    For me, Appare-ranman was one of the best anime of the season, surprised me and surpassed all my expectations.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a simple story, original, and creative, the comedy is very good (I had a great time watching) and tense moments were also good. The art is amazing, I loved the colors, the background, I liked the soundtrack and the op is a banger!!! The design and the trait of the characters is something unique and the personality of each one stands out.<br />
<br />
I liked the development of the story and especially the characters, Appare developed in a realistic and mature way. It was great to accompany them

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358584">
        in these 13 episodes.<br />
<br />
I really fucking enjoyed the show, it&#039;s captivating and I clung to the characters.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m going to miss Appare-ranman, would be happy to see a second season.<br />
<br />
I think you should watch it, this anime deserves to be on your watch list!!!!!!!!!

    Overall: 7.9<br />
<br />
The truth Appare-Ranman seemed like a revelation to me.<br />
I came here because of the expectation of the races and I end up being satisfied with much more of the work itself, which is precisely this theme. Both in the characters being simple, but at the same time with their charisma, added to a fairly well elaborated story and set at all times. A very polished visual posture and a catchy and convenient Opening for this show leave great feelings of it. So I think that in general terms this adaptation has a job that is quite subtle, without being too pretentious or commercial, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358545">
        if you give it a chance you will surely not regret it and it is fun enough to keep the viewer glued to the screen.<br />
Now if I had to name a program defect I lean towards the issue of the format and the lack of a certain number of more chapters, to give an even more epic ending. I feel that from what happened with Kosame for chapter 8/9, until the end of his broadcast of the program, events tend to have a higher pace and does not leave room for some specific issues such as the suffering and growth of Appare e on The whole race itself, which really leaves a little flavor in this sense, being very summarized in this end.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
En español:<br />
<br />
<br />
General: 7,9<br />
<br />
La verdad Appare-Ranman me parecido toda una revelación.<br />
Llegue aquí por la expectativa de las carreras y me termino quedando conforme con mucho mas de la obra en si, que justamente esta  temática. Tanto en los personajes siendo simples, pero a la vez con su carisma, sumado a una historia bastante bien elaborada e ambientada en todo momento. Una postura visual muy pulida y un Opening pegadizo e conveniente para este show dejan grandes sensaciones del mismo. Por lo que considero que en líneas generales este adaptación tiene un trabajo siendo bastante sutil, sin ser demasiado pretenciosa o comercial  pero que si le das una oportunidad seguramente no te arrepientas y es lo suficiente divertida para mantener al espectador pegado a la pantalla.<br />
Ahora si tuviera que nombrar algún defecto de programa me inclino por el tema del formato y la falta de una cierta cantidad mas de capítulos, para dar lugar aun final mas épico aun. Siento que desde lo que sucedió con Kosame por el capitulo 8/9, hasta el final de su emisión del programa, los sucesos tienden a tener un ritmo mas elevado y no deja lugar hacia algunos temas puntuales como el sufrimiento y crecimiento de Appare e sobre todo la carrera en si, que realmente deja un sabor a poco en este sentido siendo en este final muy resumida.<br />

    I’m just gonna assume someone at P.A. Works decided to throw caution to the wind and suggested something stupid for their next project. Which, if this is really how this thing came about, I’m all for it. I know darts on the wall don’t always work, but when they do, they do.<br />

Story:<br />
<br />
At the height of the roaring 20’s, an eccentric inventor by the name of Appare causes trouble in his little town in Japan before deciding that instead of staying in a place that doesn’t appreciate his push of progress, he will take his invention and his tools across the Pacific Ocean and go to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358258">
        America where stuff like that is both commonplace and encouraged given the technological advancements in the country. Dragging alongside a poor man named Kosame who only wanted to keep the poor boy safe, the two of them enter that grand trans-continental race starting for a shot at the prize money. And for Kosame, a chance to get back home.<br />
<br />
So that’s the framing device for the anime, and what we have here is definitely a trans-continental race that takes up a greater majority of the series once the setup’s out of the way. So there’s no funny business, is there? Well… Appare-Ranman has something of a mixed identity. It definitely feels like the creators wanted to do a racing/car anime. But at the same time, it also seems like they really wanted to do a western with gunslingers, shootouts, gun-fu, and the like. As a result, the story bounces back and forth between both of these storylines, crossing over a couple times only to transition the racing parts to the western parts and vice versa. While it’s not bad, it’s definitely not what I expected in this show, although given what our cast list is, this was almost assuredly the expected result.<br />
<br />
Despite that, the execution of this mixed identity was surprisingly well-made, especially given the fact that the show managed to also provide decent character arcs for most if not all of our main cast members, and managed to keep the tempo of the series going till the very end. An energy that gives the series a satisfying result due to the tension and escalating moments that keep ramping up as the western half of the show starts to encroach more and more onto the series. A big part of this as well comes from the historical aspect of the show, as 1920’s America is at the heart of the show’s story. The ugly side of this developed country from the misogyny (which isn’t an America-exclusive thing, mind you), to the treatment of its natives and other races adds another bit of spice to this already volatile mix of a show, which again, is an aspect I neither expected, yet is something I greatly appreciate.<br />
<br />
My only qualm with all of this comes with the show’s ending because the show kinda feels like it forgot to give a proper ending to the whole thing. Things just kind of end, and it’s a stain on an otherwise really fun and surprisingly well-executed show. I’m not really gonna hold it over the show’s head, but it’s kind of a shame considering the sheer amount of cheese, energy, excitement, tension, and just overall fun the series exudes. Only for the series to drop the ball at the very, very end of the series as an anticlimactic tick to the whole thing.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
You ever seen Wacky Races? Think that but with stereotypes as the racers instead of goofy characters.<br />
<br />
Appare is our kabuki actor-looking protagonist that’s both equal parts eccentric and aloof. Focusing pretty much only on his machines and whatever goal he has a the current time, Appare is interesting if only because he feels more like a robot than a human. His qualities make him less of a protagonist to latch onto, but instead more of an interesting case study to watch as the audience is treated to watching a robot discover feelings for the first time. Personally I think he’s interesting, but gets treated like too much of the Messiah to everything, especially since his only expertise is machines. He’s certainly a good engineer, being able to do literal ‘quick maths’ on the spot, but in the rest of the cast list, there’re definitely other contenders for the spot of ‘main character’ in this show.<br />
<br />
Kosame is the opposite of Appare, being more grounded and more of a realist who worries about their situation since they’re in a new country who by all sense of the word, are folk that they really shouldn’t be able to communicate with. Semantics aside, Kosame comes into the series as a character who has his own personal struggles and has a fairly satisfying character arc that, though kind of by the numbers, helps add to the series’s overall energy. Which is something that I can’t really complain about because his chemistry with Appare is fun, and he definitely pulls his weight around to become his own character instead of just the dude to reel Appare in.<br />
<br />
All that being said the cast for the Appare-Ranman is a bunch that each hit different points of stereotypes and have similar character arcs that ‘make sense’ for who they are. Al is the fancy French boy who wants to prove something to Daddy, Jing is the Chinese woman who wants to prove that a woman can do what a man can do, you have the Hispanic brothers who fit the small smart one and the big gentle one tropes respectively, Hototo the Native who wants revenge on a white man, literal Jazz Funk personified, and the brooding white outlaw loner who does things his way and has a dark past. They’re all pretty simple characters with simple character arcs and motivations, but seeing how they mix with each other is where the real fun comes in. Their interactions with each other were way more entertaining than they had any right to be, and after a while, I kind of cared less that they were all stereotypes that served the purpose of easy character writing. Especially as the story pushed them to talk to each other more and more and face similar issues.<br />
<br />
Aesthetics:<br />
<br />
P.A. Works seems to have fallen in a bit of a ‘less spendy’ mood lately, as the quality here with Appare-Ranman is about the same as what we got with Irozuku and Fairy Gone, with a few resources allocated elsewhere depending on the project. With Appare-Ranman, the budget seems to have gone towards the backgrounds and animation. The setpieces depicting 1920’s America are honestly really nice, and it’s clear that for the times the cast are in cities, there was effort to show off the kind of modern living that was available at the time. And by contrast, what the midwest looked like as a result of Manifest Destiny, showing off a lot of western-inspired towns that really makes me think that there were people involved that really wanted to make a Western show instead of a racing one.<br />
<br />
And that shows with the animation as there are a lot, and I mean a surprising amount of gunfight scenes that show off a lot of dynamic action and CQC combat among the combatants. It’s something I never expected in the series, and I’m pleasantly surprised that they went that route considering this was supposed to be a RACING anime. Speaking of the racing side, the show exclusively uses 3-D modelling in order to show off the various vehicles in the series, which honestly works for the show if only because the models flush well into the overall look of the series, and it’s not a glaringly obvious thing that looks out of place.<br />
<br />
Mia REGINA’s “I got it!” is a high energy, big brass song that is way more memorable than it has any right to be. The song just screams ‘fun’ to me, which coupled with the images of gunslinging and car repairs, shows off the series in a spectacular light by being this excitable, big band number that portrays what Appare-Ranman is in a nutshell.<br />
<br />
By contrast, Shoutarou Morikubo’s “I’m Nobody” is a more acoustic song that plays during the literal movie credits that show up at the end of every episode. It’s literally country music, and well, it’s fitting. It’s not my style personally, but it only adds to the sheer amount of ‘America’ that P.A. Works wanted to go for this show when they made it. Which is an effort I appreciate, even if some of that effort went in ways I don’t really agree with.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
I was supposed to finish this one last season, but COVID happened, so unfortunately this show got pushed back a season. (Which ofc a P.A. Works show of all things got pushed back for me, ugh.) That being said, honestly…I really like this one. My history of shitting on P.A. Works shows is nothing new, but honestly, this show was really, really fun. And I’m glad I can put away my distaste for the company’s storytelling directions for one show. (Though I can’t guarantee it for the next one.)<br />
<br />
That being said, there’re a few notes I can’t fully agree with, and that’s mainly on some of the character designs and the coding that goes along with it. Things like having the only Chinese character know Kung Fu and the Native American wear feathers in their hair make for easy nods to representation, but kind of turn the ‘diversity’ instead into either design or character quirks for each of the racers. Though this is just a minor point of criticism just based on my personal bias. Overall, the cast is still one that I had a blast watching, and Sofia is undoubtedly the best of the bunch. And I lament the treatment of her character the longer the series went on.<br />
<br />
Honestly, there really isn’t much I can say that’s bad about the series aside from a few minor points, a mixed identity, and a sort of anticlimactic ending. The story is kind of by the numbers, but I can’t really dispute how much enjoyment that I got out of this story, especially with how much I like history, and this really scratches my itch at something that’s not wholly Japanese set in a not Japanese place. I’d recommend this show to anyone who wants to have a fun time, since this show has the correct amount of dumb and serious to make the viewing experience satisfying and fun as a result.<br />
<br />
Now if only P.A. Works could keep up a streak past one…

        Do you want to watch an anime adoptation of Fast and the Furious? Just kdding! But here i&#039;ll introduce you a somewhat peculiar anime about steampunk meets samurai meets cowboy meets weird hair MC. The story starts with our MC Appare, a very genius 19 years old boy when it comes to machine. He builds his own machinery such as steam boats and other invention but in his country that&#039;s not something acknowledgable for them because they are too old fashioned and still stuck in the past. He decided to go for an adventurer and prove to the world that his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356146">
        creation. To do this He must join a competition of racing with his companion but this race is not an ordinary race. It is a race of life and death and all of the participants here have their own reason why they must win the race. As for the artstyle, damn, the animation is good and fluent and check out the manga! The artsyle really is beautiful. As you can see the character design in this anime is quite unique so it&#039;s a plus points for me. As for the sounds i really love the OP and ED and all of the seiyuus are really great. One of my favorite seiyuu is here, Amamiya Sora, who played as Jing ( the chinese hot girl). I really love all of the cast, no one is boring or dull and even the season 1 have only 11 episodes you&#039;ll get attached with all of them because they did a great job of developing all the characters within these 11 episodes that&#039;s a good job. I really fucking enjoyed the show so it&#039;s an easy 10/10
