    With the ever growing list of rom-coms coming out every season, Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai (We Never Learn) honestly isn’t anything home to write about. We just had a similar show called “5-toubun no Hanayome” that aired a few months ago. That show came together as a teenage rom-com with harem content. Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai tries to be something on its own but ends up being a fallout of stupidity.<br />
<br />
On the plus side, I do applaud that the manga has been running as long as it is right now. Too many shounen jump series ends being victims of the dreaded axe yet

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311710">
        this one managed to evade that. Trust me, I do want to see a shounen jump show succeed with romantic elements. The anime offers a 13-episode adaptation although from what’s shown, it’s far from a complete adaptation. For what’s worth, the anime is more of an advertisement of the manga that touches the main story with its cast of characters. But if you are actually expecting your mind to be blown with some masterful storytelling, then I’m afraid I got some bad news.<br />
<br />
The English title is translated as “We Never Learn” and spells out the story for itself. A straightforward premise like this is the way to go considering we have a set of goofball characters. To get the boring part out of the way, we got 3rd year Nariyuki Yuiga, the hardworking guy with a dense and dull personality. I can’t fandom how such a guy can be so oblivious when it comes to the feelings of certain people but alas, he’s our male protagonist. Not long after, we are introduced to Fumino, Rizu, and Uruka. All of them are talented in certain subjects but needs help in other areas. It shouldn’t take long for viewers to realize that some of these girls have feelings towards Yuiga. Unfortunately, the show loves to dance around the thought of building a relationship between Nariyuki and these girls. What ends up happening is little to no development with a senseless form of romance, if you can even call it that.<br />
<br />
Now, I do want to mention that We Never Learn’s storytelling feels more like skits with an intention to humor. It seems that every chance it gets, the show pokes fun of the idea of studying and the way characters interact with each other. Even Mafuyu Kirisu (the teacher of Ichinose academy) gets dragged into certain shenanigans despite her more mature personality and older age. Taking a look back at the trio of students though, there’s not really much special about any of them. In fact, they fit under archetype characters that you can find in just about any rom-com shows these days. For instance, Fumino is the sensitive girl with few friends. Rizu is the serious genius type who has trouble interacting with others. And finally, Uraka is the energetic girl who easily makes friends with others. With this character roster, it’s easy to distinguish each one of them but the show itself lacks concrete characterization. Sure, we see a good degree of their character traits and even some background storytelling. However, the show doesn’t make an impact to make these characters truly stand out. Forget Nariyuki. The girls only attracts my attention when they interact with certain circumstances. They never draw more on their own. On the other hand, I do find myself invested in some of the other supporting characters. Name such as Kominami Asumi and Sawako Sekijou managed to capture my attention more than the main cast.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I do give praise to making the story entertaining on occasions. School can be a boring setting but the author is able to take advantage of the setting to make humorous drama. It’s one of the perks of being a romantic comedy where the author can stretch their imaginations. For a rom-com harem, I believe the show stands out the best when it seeks to entertain. If the characters were better written, this would have easily stood out as a solid show. Unfortunately, that’s not the case.<br />
<br />
With a collaboration between studio Silver and Arvo Animation, this pretty much stands out as an average looking show. To be honest, A-1 Pictures would have been my first guess considering the license. Nonetheless, the animation quality lacks impact with its uncharismatic character designs. Nariyuki has a punchable face while the main girls lacks any distinctive features. I will say this though, the anime likes fan service. It’s slightly tamer compared to the manga but in later episodes, it’s more and more fleshed out. Uraka is the big target eye candy for this for her status in the swim team and well-toned body. However, Fumino and the other are vulnerable too. Considering that this is a rom-com, you should expect a lot of shenanigans coming your way. The character expressions also speaks for itself when you see them react in ridiculous manners.<br />
<br />
Should I be surprised that We Never Learn ended up being no more than a mediocre show? Not really. As a manga reader, I kept my expectations in check. This anime lacks a bold story with a weak cast and borderlined forced comedy. It may draw out a few laughs on occasions but once you realize what you’re in for, there’s really much more to see. If you want to give the manga a shot, then be my guest. Just know that We Never Learn dropped the ball and there’s much better rom-coms out there.

    Ah, studying.  The bane of everyone’s existence.  While there are worse undertakings, nothing compares to the angst of sacrificing countless hours to pass a meaningless course to attain a worthless degree that grants an aimless job to sustain yourself before you die.  Of course, having aspirations is ideal to avoid a life of poverty, but not all problems are solved with blind ambition.  Sometimes, as it were, you have to smell the roses.  Take pleasure in the little moments, before life passes you by.<br />
<br />
Therefore, my advice to Nariyuki Yuiga: appreciate the harem you find yourself in, because before you know

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307244">
        it, you’ll be stuck with one broad for the rest of your life.  Nothing wrong with that outcome, per se; nevertheless, when you discover a ‘gold mine,’ you stuff your pockets and grab with both hands.<br />
<br />
The plot of “Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai” is elementary.  In an effort to secure a college scholarship, Nariyuki tutors two girls — Rizu Ogata and Fumino Furuhashi — in the subjects they struggle with, yet wish to pursue in university.  As the story progresses, additional female characters receive Nariyuki’s tutelage, via creative means best suited to their particular interests.  It’s a concept that is ripe for teasing out character nuances, if only that were the focus.  Apparently, the writers seem content with devising new ‘games’ to study, rather than developing the characters themselves.  In exchange for this lapse in judgement, we are left with stock characters that exhibit no changes on the existing paradigms.  They are neither relatable, nor worth your time.<br />
<br />
Due to the deficiencies in the story and characters, the enjoyment is paltry.  Laughter is sparse to non-existent.  The romance is third-rate, along with being cliched.  And the episodes are a trudge to complete.  Simply put: boring, boring, boring!

    TL/DR first: It&#039;s trash<br />
<br />
This anime is so bad I actually went ahead and looked up my old MAL login credentials just so I could login and talk about how bad this series is.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with Setting/Story:<br />
<br />
Setting: Dude starts tutoring a bunch of generic chicks coming straight out of a bullshit bingo of stereotypes in regards to character traits, background and looks. <br />
<br />
Dude is a generic glasses intelligent guy and obviously a total pushover and goody-two shoes who cannot ever refuse anybody. In any other anime he would be like Minor side character C with a tendency to die first depending on the genre.<br />
<br />
You got the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321993">
        flat-breasted (and very conscious about it who would&#039;ve guessed) blue haired chick who sucks at math but is a genius at linguistics or whatever<br />
<br />
Then you have the opposite big tiddy math chick who apparentl seems to have some form of undiagnosed asperger or another form of autism given how bad she sucks at both social interactions and any subject related to that.<br />
<br />
Finally you the sports chick which is bad at English but can swim. yay. Her most notable features are probably her tan lines oh and the childhood friend wave gets ridden a little bit but only back to middle school.<br />
<br />
These are the main &quot;heroines&quot;. There are two notable side character, one being the graduated senpai chick who currently fails at getting enrolled at uni and ronins around and the pink haired teacher who would&#039;ve failed to get a teaching license in any anime not being a complete pile of garbage since she too seems to have some form of autism impairing her communication skills to one word lines or one liners at best which as we all know is the most desirable trait in a teacher. But common sense or any sense really is the last thing you&#039;re going to find in this anime so just don&#039;t bother looking for it.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah before I forget: All three main chicks have an obvious crush on the bimbo protagonist but you probably figured that out by the harem tag already you sneaky smart person you.<br />
<br />
As for the story:<br />
<br />
<br />
There is none really. No notable development aside from some basic adjustments to the premise like pink haired teacher chick changing her mind from previously against him tutoring to acknowledging him. It&#039;s basically episodical. <br />
<br />
Dude tries to teach these so-called geniuses their bad subjects. The rest of the show you can imagine as someone checking off every item on the unofficial list of mishaps, misunderstandings and other generic anime events all of which would&#039;ve not even being a thing if only one of the involved characters respectively showed the slightest amount of common sense (including the blue haired social&quot;genius&quot; chick). This is apparently supposed to be funny and entertaining but unless this is your first anime ever you probably have seen this shit like 50 times by now. There is frankly nothing original in the entire series and the implemented and re-used stuff is just badly done.<br />
<br />
Art: Talking about badly done so is the Art. Animations are poor. Backgrounds are poor. Characters are poor. Not really much to say except that it&#039;s incredibly poor quality. You can probably produce the show with MS Paint as your only tool and it wouldn&#039;t be much of a downgrade if at all in regards to the art.<br />
<br />
Sound: Well probably the best about the series which means that the sound at least isn&#039;t horrible but also nothing worth of praise. It&#039;s just a big whatever.<br />
<br />
Characters: Yeah as already stated above. Just a boring patchwork of generic stereotypes with a disposition towards one or another form of slight to heavy autism and if you&#039;d take the combined common sense of all characters involved it would amount to around the level of a cow. You can probably take any (not even so much) advanced AI, give it a database of traits and tell it to come up with some characters. Probably wouldn&#039;t be worse than the characters in this show but at least a couple dozen times more entertaining.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: None. It&#039;s bad and cringe.<br />
<br />
Overall: See TL/DR at the top: It&#039;s trash. It&#039;s bad. It&#039;s boring. It&#039;s unoriginal. Nobody ever should be forced to watch this waste of time and ressources. It&#039;s an insult that this pile of garbage got a 2nd season.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading and have a good time (you won&#039;t with this anime though)

    When I was young and first was getting into anime the harem genre was one of my favorites. It was a pleasure to watch a lot of cute girls do cute and lewd things, as well as have the excitement of seeing who would win and fighting in waifu wars with friends that had objectively inferior taste (unless they happened to pick actual best girl, and in that case they&#039;re fine.) <br />
<br />
However after watching more and more of these, it became clear that while some were well made and had lots of life to them, there were others that were not well made and ended

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311719">
        up being cheap vehicles for a show that they assumed a horny teenage fandom would eat up, and they did. Often the cast wouldn&#039;t be fully developed and were either just archetypes with less more going for them, or where way in the background causing one girl to take the center stage and defeating one of the points of a harem. While many seasonal harems ended up disappointing in these ways, We Never Learn, is a return to the good old days.<br />
<br />
It doesn&#039;t take that much to make a good harem that&#039;s a joy to watch. While I do love deep character development and interesting meanings and points that are made in a show, not every show needs to have them, and in particular a good harem isn&#039;t defined by having those. In my opinion, the most important parts to a harem are having a varied and likeable cast of girls, and having good fan-service. And Bokuben happens to have both of those.<br />
<br />
The main cast is a whole lot of fun. They interact with each other and play off of each other and are very clearly friends with each other. They don&#039;t exist just for the sake of the male lead but they have goals of their own and friendships outside of the male lead. They have charming personalities that makes it easy to root for them and very easy to like them. And while they don&#039;t have a great amount of development they have enough development that they feel like unique characters and not archetypes. Some of the silly things they can get into are a lot of fun and overall it made me happy to watch this show. <br />
<br />
And it fills it&#039;s role as a harem very well. There are three main girls and they all have their own charms that are quite distinct. There&#039;s an airhead who is much more emotionally connected to everyone but herself, a brainaic who can&#039;t understand others or herself, and a tomboy childhood friend who is pretty hyper and excitable. And while the archetypes are certainly there, they&#039;re vibrant enough to outshine them, and feel unique. Each of them gets screen time with the main lead, and each of them have a reasonable claim to him. Unlike many harems in the past it actually does feel up in the air who will win and not just a forgone conclusion that was turned into a harem for some reason. They each have their own dynamic relationship with the lead and it&#039;s a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
Furthermore the show also gives a good deal of fanservice so that we can see the more echiii situations with them and capitalize on their cuteness. And while most of them happen by accident, of course, a staple trope of these harems. The girls are aware enough to not blame him, and if they do blame him it doesn&#039;t last longer than 30 seconds. Too many harems like to go off on the blame game for too long which detracts from the show and ruins the vibe they have going. If anything what Bokuben does so well is it allows this vibe to continue throughout the show, and rarely becomes too much of a drag. The art and sound also help with this a lot as the art is pretty high quality and always looks nice. The sound is better jovial and helps accent the more comedic parts of the show. While it may not be impressive on its own it really works in the show.<br />
<br />
It may not be the most impressive show, but Bokuben is a good solid harem, and I very much enjoyed watching it. I&#039;d recommended it to all other harem fans.

    Sometimes the best things in a romcom are found in the contrasts: Silly jokes, the most stupid series of events,  perhaps a clumsy teacher, or a grow up student with the face of a kid,  whose actions serve as a booster that helps us to appraise the differences between all the cast. All this nonsense works as a preparation for the future action now that the second season is announced in the last episode with the simple words &quot;tsuzuku&quot; (続くor つづく).<br />
<br />
Maybe I shouldn&#039;t be praising this series, but the season was too average, and I couldn&#039;t find an acceptable series. Although Bokutachi wa

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311876">
        Benkyou ga Dekinai is an unexpected finding with small but potent pleasures that can hook an avid anime enthusiast like you. This silly show has a lot of similarities with “5-toubun no Hanayome” to the point that it could be a copy. The question is: who copied whom?  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, the plot is delightful because it does not follow the typical harem settings. In this series a guy, Nariyuki Yuiga needs to teach a group of girls that are considered geniuses in some fields and stupid in some other areas of knowledge. However, ironical as it may seem, these &quot;geniuses&quot; want to study a career where their abilities are useless. This setting leads to a series of silly events where we can enjoy the differences between each character, their feelings, and we could smile on the stupid jokes. Sadly, after some episodes, the series can give the impression that something is missing and perhaps you could end dropping it because it is tedious or lacks romance and the storytelling is average. Nonetheless, this first season only works as an introduction that shows the main characters and paves the path for the future season, where I do hope to see relevant plot twists, romance, and new jokes.<br />
<br />
The characters are acceptable, they have a big contrast. From my perspective, Yuiga, the ordinary guy, good at studying, poor, hard worker, is a neutral character that understands the girls&#039; decisions but lacks any romance comprehension.  This romantic aspect can be complemented with Fumino, who acts like the cupid of the story. I can explain this behavior because she is a literary genius, so her way to understand the human emotions is by far more different than Yuiga and the other girls such us Rizu or Takemoto. On the other hand, as silly as it looks, Rizu is the typical genius stereotype. However, she is a hard worker, and she cannot understand her feelings. And talking about feelings, the story introduces Takemoto, the athlete, full of energy and finds herself in a never-ending dilemma (cliche?).<br />
<br />
The other characters, Mafuyu, the silly teacher and Asumi, the sempai, are a healthy complement to the plot because they refresh the story when the author needs to change some repetitive jokes. <br />
<br />
The characters design is acceptable. Even if for some persons it looks weird, I want to say it is consistent. The animation follows the graphics from the manga and tries to keep closer to them. Asking more from this kind of design could be wrong.<br />
<br />
Mostly, the show is entertaining: For Yuiga to teach these girls, and for the girls to understand their feelings and to experience romance. Together, create an acceptable comedy that is just beginning.  <br />

    EDIT: i finished watching the show and still feel the same as i did after 1 episode.*<br />
<br />
There couldn&#039;t be a more average, run of the mill harem anime than this. Its fine to look at, and romantic antics ensue with the harem roster slowly filling out.<br />
<br />
Filling the role of harem manga in shonen jump after nisekoi ended, We never learns plot seems like more than a harem, but it isn&#039;t. Main protag helping out girls of different natures. small boob smart rich girl, big boob short restaurant girl, and athletic childhood friend. (also senseii and loli doctor girl). Romcom ensues.<br />
<br />
Except there is no comedy. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308051">
        jokes are bland and overused. And even if they had a chance of cracking a chuckle, it&#039;s ruined by the god awful pacing. This show is slow. Obviously they are adapting 3 chapters an episode. The manga is a quick read with stellar panel flow so you can fly through everything. If a joke doesn&#039;t hit, your already on the next page. Problem with the anime is it needs to stay grounded. They adapted it like a standard romance show, so the comedy can&#039;t be as bouncy as something like konosuba. <br />
<br />
There is no animation. Which is fine if my Brain had anything else to do. Absorbing new plot details, Pondering the dialogue, or taking in the artwork. But its just standard talking with standard art with no animation.<br />
Truly dull and hard to sit through<br />
<br />
conclusion : this is spring seasons generic harem. even the shitty isekai kenja no mago has better romance than this. If you like the story, read the manga. There is no value of this adaption besides getting more people invested in the source material.<br />
<br />
4/10 only because there&#039;s worse this season<br />

    English isn&#039;t my native language, so you may find some redaction mistakes; anyway, I&#039;ll try to do my best in this review.<br />
<br />
- This review cointains spoilers -<br />
<br />
What&#039;s the meaning of the word generic? First thing that comes to my mind is about something that doesn&#039;t purpose absolutely nothing new, something built in a controlled space without any risk involved, something constructed with a formula; some people have no problem with this while it be entertaining enough, others simply doesn&#039;t like it and prefer to don&#039;t give it their time, the most famous example is the MCU: everyone knows that most of its movies follow the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307295">
        same formula, in despite of this fact, these movies tend to be in the top of the box office rankings, which demonstrates that it has a certain grade of appreciation from the public, but in the other side, there are people who got tired of the same formula repeated once and once again, getting them fatigued of this tool, till the point of provoking the hate from some of which in the past where the fans of the franchise. I mention this because it can be applied to the harem genre, it has its public which hopes every season for the new show from this genre, but it also has a huge amount of people who are tired of one of the most formulaic genres: takes place in school, there&#039;s a childhood friend, there&#039;s a tsundere, there&#039;s a kuudere, the male protagonist is too insecure and socially awkward, its ending is as ambiguous as posible in hopes of a second season that probably will never come, and a long etcetera.<br />
For me, being generic isn&#039;t necesarily equal to being bad, it is possible to follow a formula and finish with a good product anyway, and I think this series is an example of it; there are some which states that it&#039;s generic, and they aren&#039;t wrong, but that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s bad, it follows the rules that the formula it uses has stablished and doesn&#039;t make something we haven&#039;t seen before, but it still manages to give us an interesting series.<br />
<br />
The story turns around Nariyuki Yuiga, an average school student who dreams with joining a good university, but he hasn&#039;t a good economic situation, which obstructs his dream; when the director of the school offers him a recomendation letter in exchange of being the tutor of two other students he accepts, but he&#039;s hugely surprised at the moment of knowing their names, Rizu Ogata and Fumino Furuhashi, the two famous geniuses of the school: Rizu is extremely skilled with maths and science while Fumino is with literature, but the problem is that they&#039;re trying to better in the other&#039;s subject and joining an university specialized in those areas; Nariyuki&#039;s work is make them better in those areas, but soon he&#039;ll learn that in despite of their position as geniuses, this won&#039;t be easy, and things only will get more complicated as they become closer and other girls appears in his world.<br />
If that premise sounds familiar is because it&#039;s very common, as it serves as a believable excuse for surrounding the male lead with their female partners, but it actually works, it&#039;s believable and well structured, one detail that proves it is the fact that he isn&#039;t their first tutor, there have been some before him which finished stopping at one point. From the moment he accepts to be the tutor of Riza and Fumino the plot follows a path that we could expect from a harem: the protagonists are confused about certain things, they stablish a plan, the plan doesn&#039;t work and things become harder, they stablish another plan, in the process they share some significant moments, the third girl appears, the blushes begin and the compromising situations appear, they become even closer...<br />
That&#039;s the path this and practically every harem show follow, but here we have some interesting things: the story is pretty basic, it musn&#039;t have a theme and if it have it, it must be really subtle (I don&#039;t know, effort maybe?), but it&#039;s plot is well writen, it works and keep things going further, it follows the &#039;harem&#039; formula but uses it in a correct way, even sometimes try to be creative; as most harem shows, it&#039;s ligth-hearted and focused in a comic tone, the comedy also follow the formula with its compromising situations, but doesn&#039;t abuse of it and these are well justified and funny, at least for me, furthermore, there are some pretty smart jokes, with good construction and timing; it&#039;s fanservice could perfectly not exist but at least it isn&#039;t obstructuve, and sometimes is used as a nice excuse for some good jokes.<br />
<br />
When we talk about characters we talk about the strongest point of the series, they follow archetypes of the harem genre and anime in general, but works with it in a functional way and leaves space to develop them, not too much, but at least there&#039;s development, each one of them is well defined, they have strengths, they have debilities, they have goals and dreams that defines their actions, some receive a better treatment than others, but they all are interesting and lovable; for example, their motivations: all are understandable but some are more relatable because they&#039;re more specific, the best example is Fumino vs Rizu, Fumino&#039;s motivation to study sciences is her deceased mother and how through the stars she thinks she can stablish a conection with her, childish and inmature, like her, but completely reasonable and even touching, while Rizu&#039;s motivation is much more ambiguous, she wants to study literature for comprehend better the people around her and their behaviors, still strong but less powerful than Fumino&#039;s one.<br />
Nariyuki seems to be your normal harem protagonist, insecure and socially awkward, but he doesn&#039;t follow that rule excessively as other harem protagonists, he has this characteristics in a non-annoying level, along with others which help to define him better, for example he&#039;s smart, pretty smart, enough for realisticaly dreaming about joining a good univeristy, he&#039;s also direct, although he&#039;s a bit shy, he won&#039;t stop when he considers necessary to say something, sometimes cruel, sometimes dumb, sometimes correct, no matter, he will say it. Another character that follow an archetype is Rizu, she&#039;s a kuudere and fulfil the most common characteristics of this archetype: she&#039;s smart, she&#039;s quiet, she&#039;s short, she has short hair, she uses glasses (I mean, if she would be flat she would be a redhead version of Yuki from SHnY), you got the idea; she follow strongly her archetype but it works because her interactions with others are organic and show some minor details that give her a bit more of depth. Fumino doesn&#039;t seem to strictly follow an archetype, the closest one would be the moe, because she&#039;s sweet and moe means (in a summarized version) adorable; as I mentioned before, she&#039;s childish and inmature, she doesn&#039;t seem to have a real notion about her actions, she&#039;s very relaxed and she&#039;s a bit clumsy, but she has a strong determination and she&#039;s pretty sincere. Uraka Takamoto is the third girl in order of appearance, she&#039;s energic, she&#039;s strong, she&#039;s highly skilled physically, she has an easiness in sports, she&#039;s spontaneous and she&#039;s very determined, but she&#039;s pretty dumb and extremely shy when we talk about love; for instance, she&#039;s the childhood friend of the show, but the twist is that Uraka isn&#039;t Nariyuki&#039;s childhood friend, Nariyuki is Uraka&#039;s childhood friend, and her shyness hadn&#039;t let her confess her feelings after an unknown number of years, and even if she see an oportunity for expressing their feeling or making an advance in her relation with Nariyuki, she will finish letting it go for her insecurity. There isn&#039;t too much supporting characters with actual relevance, but till I understand there are two girls left, one would be one of the anterior tutors of Rizu and Fumino, and the other I don&#039;t really know where will come from (I&#039;m an anime only viewer); one thing that I found interesting is that there are two characters that could fit with the tsundere archetype, but none of them belong to the main cast, which is really surprising, one is Mizuki, Nariyuki&#039;s sister, and the other is Sawaka Sekijo, the Science Club&#039;s President.<br />
<br />
In the technical side, the animation comes from Silver and Arvo Animation, two studios from which apparently no one heard before; their job is good, the character design is attractive, I specially like the art in the eyes, simple but very good, the color palette is soft and borderlines the pastel color often but it doesn&#039;t stand out to be fair, where the animation shines is in the facial expressions and the reactions of the characters, you know, this kind of face: (o_o), it uses this style that everyone in the community knows but also goes further with more detailed frames and a wider group of reactions, especially with Nariyuki; the work of the seiyuus is very good and gives much spirit to the characters, the music is good but is pretty limited to work for the scene, to complement the other elements and never really stands out, anyway, it&#039;s beatiful sometimes, the opening is the typical harem opening with a &#039;feel good&#039; mood, the ending follows the same path, they may be catchy but dubiously memorable, although being fair the artstyle in both is pretty good.<br />
<br />
As you&#039;ve seen (or read I should say), this series has potencial to go further, but surely it won&#039;t, who knows?, maybe it finish focusing on the characters and its development, or maybe not; anyway, actually this is a good show and it&#039;s pretty entertaining and funny, even if it can be fairly called generic, I would love it to go further, but I&#039;m happpy with what I&#039;ve got in this 4 episodes.

    What I don&#039;t get it is the abundance of anime haters saying that the anime is full of troupes and the same story and blah blah blah. Why can&#039;t we as a community just enjoy the shows that are given to us, anime, in the end, is a way to escape or find enjoyment. Yes, this series is basically Go-toubun but with no sisters as the harem but that doesn&#039;t matter. What matters is that it is an enjoyable show to watch and I find it interesting. Just seeing so many low reviews makes me laugh, who are you to say a show is low

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308849">
        just because it is stereotypical but then agian it is also not my place to judge peoples opinion. So if you watch it and don&#039;t like that&#039;s fine but my personal recommendation is to give this a chance because I did and don&#039;t regret a single second of it. After watching the 5th episode I binge read the manga it quickly became one of my favorite stories since Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai. tldr people are entitled to their own opinion but give this a chance you might be surprised idk why I did tldr this review isn&#039;t even that long idk how yall write that much on a series lol. Hope everyone has a good day if you read this :) pce <br />
<br />
<br />
UPDATE : <br />
<br />
I find it hella funny that people can get a review of an anime after only seeing like 4eps lol, read update on manga or wait till anime ends then give it a 4 rating :) just sayin

    Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai is without a doubt one of the best harems I’ve seen. And I watched a lot of those. Part of its strength is that it wasn’t carried by single strong point, but rather was solid all around:<br />
The most important part of harem are, obviously, waifus. It’s pretty normal to have one main girls and “fodder” that is meant to lose. Or even if that’s not the case, harems rarely offer more than 1 or 2 interesting picks. BokuBen wins at both of those. Not only all girls get more or less equal development and chances to win, they also all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311833">
        have top tier waifu potential. Yes, to my surprise, every single of them is great, to the point that I can’t decide which one I’d call “best girl” or pick myself. On top of it, Yuiga himself is not a bad character too.<br />
Being a rom-com, this anime doesn’t offer much in terms of story. At the same time it’s still executed nicely. All the comedic moments, developments, fanservice etc scenes are rather reasonable and don’t feel forced. Pacing is good and comedy level above average. What more could I ask for?<br />
What really helps with everything else is art. It’s awesome. No, it’s not some crazy quality, high budget stuff. On that front it’s rather average. What makes it special is style that fits sooo well with the characters and lighthearted atmosphere of story. The way girls are drawn is both cute and pretty and their emotions are shown in really captivating way.<br />
Overall it is, as I said, very solid harem. Some might find it forgettable and doesn&#039;t bring anything new to the table (&quot;generic&quot; lol), but I believe any fan of the genre will appreciate what it has to offer.<br />

    Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai is a high school romantic comedy. The setting here is that our protagonist Nariyuki is great in academics. However, he is not going good financially and needed to get a VIP scholarship from his school. To his delight, the School Principal decided to give the VIP scholarship ti Nariyuki with a condition, Nariyuki must tutor two of his classmates. Rizu Ogata is a genius at science but struggles at literature. Fumino Furuhashi is the opposite, excelling in literature but is horrible at science.<br />
<br />
In the beginning, this anime tackles the reason Rizu and Fumino try to enter a major opposite to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311707">
        their talent. It is touching to see the reasons and how Nariyuki empathizes with it. We also get a third character, Uruka Takemoto. She is amazing at swimming but bad in academics. While all of this is great, it is a shame because it doesn&#039;t last throughout the anime.<br />
<br />
About halfway through, a pattern becomes clear to be seen. Nariyuki and everyone else gets put in a situation, which may or may not be related to their studies. These situations are used to show the series&#039; true colours, Fanservice. All the plot that have been introduced are just a setting, it tries its best to protect the status quo as the show focuses on getting more fanservice to the screen. It becomes clear that as the harem&#039;s being formed, the original focus is thrown away.<br />
<br />
The true colours of this anime extend to the whole cast. This includes Fumino, Rizu, Uruka, and their teacher, Mafuyu Kirisu. Late in the show, another character gets introduced, Kominami Asumi. She is older than Nariyuki and failed to pass the college entrance exam last year. Her introduction is actually a refreshing breeze for the anime, as it starts to get stale with its pattern.<br />
<br />
So should you watch this anime? It depends. If you&#039;re hoping the anime explores more on the characters and how they are pursuing subjects they are struggling with, go look elsewhere. In the other hand, if you&#039;re looking for a light-hearted school romantic comedy with minimal plot progression and some fanservice, this is a good anime to watch. Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai is good at that with some slightly amusing scenes and characters.

    The easiest comparison I can make for this show is either a soap opera where drama WANTS to happen but doesn&#039;t, or your typical harem with a gimmick setup in order to get things off the ground.  Well, there&#039;re worse ways to start your story I suppose.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Nariyuki Yuiga is an average high school student whose highest selling point is being a jack of all grades in school, doing well in all subjects but not really excelling.  One day he&#039;s informed by his school&#039;s headmaster that he&#039;ll be able to get the school&#039;s VIP recommendation for college on one condition: he must tutor the school&#039;s most

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311745">
        valuable honor students Rizu Ogata and Fumino Furuhashi in their worst subjects to a similarly proficient level.<br />
<br />
The show&#039;s translation title of &#039;We Can&#039;t Study&#039; is really only partially true to the setup of the series&#039;s story.  Taking roughly two chapters of the manga per episode, the story can largely be explained as a romcom school series where studying primarily serves as the series&#039;s backdrop than its main focus.  There&#039;s definitely progress with how the girls&#039; grades improve as the series goes on due to the numerous amount of study scenes we see in the series, but this isn&#039;t really what the series wants to be even though it really should make academics its main focus.<br />
<br />
A typical episode setup involves the main cast spending time studying in some manor before the situation spirals out of control through random acts of god in order to further Nariyuki&#039;s relationship with two females that progressively increases to five by the end of the series.  Sometimes it improves the girls&#039; proficiency in studying, sometimes not.<br />
<br />
Depending on who Nariyuki is interacting with dictates the direction of the episode, which either creates a massive air of awkward dialogue where no party knows what to say, or completely coincidental encounters that were handcrafted by the twisted machinations of a higher power.  Because of this, episodes can feel largely disconnected from each other because the narrative relies so heavily on the &#039;status quo&#039; of the characters&#039; relationships that it feels like filler with millimeters of progress for characters too nervous to just spit out what&#039;s on their minds.  As such, the pacing for progress feels very stop and go with a rare episode having some large changes while the next four or something episodes either have nothing of note happen afterwards or features the awkward fallout.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Yuiga Nariyuki is a bingo card of harem protagonist traits and tropes.  Dense?  Check.  Lucky pervert situations?  Yup.  Nice to everyone, apologizes profusely, and doesn&#039;t know how to handle women?  Fuck, we got a winner here folks!  Yuiga&#039;s character is less of a protagonist or character, and more of the starting gun to whatever shenanigans is destined to happen.  He constantly studies but usually gets flustered by either a passing comment said by a member of the female cast, or notices something about them (like being close or seeing that they&#039;re weirdly pretty today).  He consistently does this and it&#039;s not very exciting to see his character amount to what we see even though it&#039;s possible to create an actually fun harem protagonist.  We get vague inklings about his past and how he became obsessed with studying, but it doesn&#039;t come to light enough to matter.<br />
<br />
Ogata Rizu, Takemoto Uruka, Kirisu Mafuyu, and Kominami Asumi are the &#039;harem&#039; members of the female cast who largely serve the &quot;studying into perverted/funny/romantic&quot; moment that makes up the basis of this series.  Each of them have a very different dynamic with Yuiga to the point that the show devotes entire episodes to his interactions with each of them as a way to give each of them a moment in the spotlight.  (Budding interest, First love, Teacher &amp; Student, and Senpai and Kohai respectively.)  They&#039;re also the show&#039;s way of raising &#039;flags&#039;/add character traits to the girls as Yuiga, through usually comedic means, accidentally finds out more about them and either gets them or someone associated to them to spill the beans on their motive for doing better.  While the content&#039;s different, the setup and payoff usually follows the same formula and I&#039;m not really interested when a lot of the dialogue in the interaction has the protagonist stutter.  A lot.  Give me characterization sure, but please spit some words out, man.<br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s Fumino Furuhashi.  Usually I talk about harem girls as a collective &quot;collect them all&quot; kind of deal, but I&#039;m giving her her own section cause this one&#039;s special.  While Furuhashi does share most of the girls&#039; motives at getting better at school, her role is being practically the only person with common sense and can read the room.  Without her, the show would be dead in its tracks because she&#039;s the only one who knows the shit that goes on around Yuiga and is the one who makes him confront the holes he&#039;s dug for himself.  She&#039;s an extremely refreshing character in a show like this because her motives aren&#039;t (mostly) based on any attraction towards the protagonist and really helps get the story going once it hits its many, many awkward roadblocks.  I actively cheer any time she&#039;s on-screen because she always manages to get the ball rolling whether or not she&#039;s the main focus of the scene.<br />
<br />
There aren&#039;t really many side characters to note of, and most of them are character-based, pertaining to their one relationship with a specific character (since each girl basically has their own support team...) and as such aren&#039;t really important to the story unless it&#039;s for a gag or when the show thinks not enough wrenches have been thrown into the current scene.  I&#039;m actually more pissed that most of the girls have at least one or two members of the cast dedicated to pushing them to pursue a romance with Nariyuki.  It&#039;s as if the girls don&#039;t have enough agency themselves to express their feelings or something.<br />
<br />
Aesthetics:<br />
<br />
Produced by a collaboration between Silver and Arvo Animation, the art for Bokutachi feels extremely bland to me.  Art-wise, the show relies heavily on a lot of really saturated and bright colors which are not only somewhat blinding, but is also a style that doesn&#039;t have a lot of depth to it.  This is mostly apparent with how exceedingly brightly colored each girls&#039; hair is, which even looks unnatural by the standards of a medium with this as a mainstay feature.  There&#039;s also a surprising amount of fanservice which is only made worse when breast size jokes are a mainstay due to Furuhashi carrying a vastly smaller cup size compared to the rest of the female cast.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s also not a lot of animation in the show&#039;s typical animation, reserving most of that for quick, sped up frames during the show&#039;s many, many comedic moments where the character&#039;s models squish and chibify themselves to express their current emotion.  There&#039;s also a constant use of tiny heads that pop up on the screen with one or two clear traits associated to each head to make sure you know which girl it is, which suspiciously reminds me of another series.  Hmm...  Since comedy&#039;s a mainstay of the series, this is where the series sits at for a greater minority of its runtime, so expect to see a lot of this when watching.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Seishun Seminar&quot; and &quot;Never Give It Up!!&quot; by the convenient artist name of &#039;Study&#039; are a pair of OP and ED tracks that aren&#039;t really all that interesting.  Super poppy songs that invoke the casual, school comedy setting aren&#039;t really my cup of tea, and aren&#039;t really the kind of songs are all that memorable.  They serve their purpose, but personally I think are songs worth skipping.<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
When I first started reading the manga, I said to myself, &quot;Wow, this reminds me of Nisekoi, and not in the good way&quot;.  The characters seemed to share a similar style, the setup to the story seemed to be largely forgotten for the sake of adding more slice of life moments with individual members of the female cast, and there were even tiny heads on the side of the screen/panels with one striking detail.  After a bit of digging, I found out that the series&#039;s author, Tsutsui Taishi, was responsible for the mahou shoujo Nisekoi spin-off, which leads to believe that he must&#039;ve also been an assistant for Nisekoi at some point prior.  So why the lengthy research report?  Well because Bokutachi is basically the middle hundred chapter section of Nisekoi where it&#039;s just the character faffing about instead of figuring out who&#039;s the right girl with the key.<br />

I don&#039;t really have much that can be said about my thoughts about the series that hasn&#039;t been said prior.  Episodes can either feel like there&#039;s story progress, or a massive slog with only a millimeter of progress to make it seem like it was ultimately worth it even though the show&#039;s just gonna return back to its status quo.  It&#039;s a frustrating cycle that can go largely unnoticed because the show is built around making these near pointless situations as comical as they can be for the sake of entertainment.  I just find it difficult to enjoy something when the characters&#039; default reaction to everything is acting flustered because Kami-sama decided to play a prank again on Yuiga that day.  Furuhashi is undoubtedly my favorite part of the series because she mostly manages to skirt around these issues with her sheer presence by pushing both Yuiga and the show in the right direction, and I shudder to think what the story would be like without her.<br />
<br />
Because of this, I find it hard to really recommend this show to many people.  Maybe to Nisekoi fans, because it&#039;s basically the same schtick where you fall into a camp and cheer for that particular girl to get the largely uninteresting protagonist trophy with a few interesting traits.  But beyond that I think the show is trashy entertainment at best.  Maybe season two will spend time on the girls&#039; arcs and explain the trials, tribulations, and reasons why the series&#039; females want to take the direction contrary to what they&#039;re best in in academics, but for right now, the show&#039;s a typical harem with only one character trying to push it in the right direction.  Godspeed, Fumino.  Godspeed.

    Riding on the exploding success that is Negi Haruba&#039;s manga and Tezuka Productions&#039; anime adaptation of The Quintessential Quintuplets, this series is more of less the same, except with one caveat: it managed to pull out a pentuplet (with a teacher and a senior graduated student)! Such ingenuity and admiration that it managed more than just the usual harem rom-com that&#039;s plastered all over the place. And just like said series, Season 2 is coming soon too (Fall 2019), so for fans, the excitement isn&#039;t over yet! Just...for now.<br />
<br />
Based on Taishi Tsutsui&#039;s manga of the same name, We Never Learn: BokuBen is about a young

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311709">
        and uprising scholar by the name of Yuiga Nariyuki, whom despite his poor performance, is desperately trying to earn the prestigious VIP recommendation to fix his future&#039;s studying financial problems and give his home some peace of mind. Problem is, in order to achieve that status, he has to tutor students who are high-flying achievers in their own study and craft, yet are complete failures when it comes to achieving their passions. Just like Fuutarou Useugi, he takes up the challenge from the school&#039;s principal (who offered him the recommendation in the first place).<br />
<br />
The waifu contestants are:<br />
- Fumino Furuhashi, excellent in Mathematics, but fails spectacularly at literature, and one that is secretly (and unconsciously) pushing her way to Yuiga&#039;s heart, and the closest yet.<br />
- Rizu Ogata, excellent in Literature, but fails spectacularly at Mathematics, her decent-sized &quot;weapons&quot; helping a bit, but not much. The weakest of the trio.<br />
- Uraka Takemoto, excellent in sports (swimming to be exact), but just like the 2 waifus, extremely poor grades, and her massive boobs give Nariyuki the sense of incoming danger. But as a childhood friend, she exhibits the same tropes of confessions and whatnot.<br />
- Senior (ronin) Asumi Kominami, working part-time in order to pay for her school fees (without the knowledge of her parents), and just like the trio, working and studying hard through justification that Yuiga (seen as the &quot;boyfriend&quot;) help her get her groove together.<br />
- Kirisu Mafuyu-sensei, Furuhashi and Ogata&#039;s former cold-hearted tutor, but yet is a very, very messy and clumsy person when all her teachings are stripped away, and unfortunately for her, being exposed to Yuiga meant that her facade is gone.<br />
<br />
All waifus, in the course of the series, try their best to get tutored by the self-proclaimed work-in-progress &quot;protagonist&quot;, not knowing that more than just the effects of studying hard for their own sake, the usual harem rom-com that&#039;s reminiscent of Nisekoi (but lesser to a degree) shows indefinitely, allowing for some random moments of affection between Nariyuki and the various waifus, in their own shine and glamour.<br />
<br />
And I&#039;m sure that many of us have been complaining about how the rom-com was really sub-par and sometimes didn&#039;t help that one waifu was anchoring all this while unconsciously being the CLOSEST to him (if you have watched the anime, you can easily guess who). But all in all, while this aspect didn&#039;t resonate with many who have seen the tropey formula a million times over, it was certainly a breath of fresh air somehow.<br />
<br />
So, before the start of the series, even if you have never cared about this aspect, I feel like it is worth mentioning: the co-studio collaboration of low-profile key animations - veteran Studio Silver (founded in February 2001) and newly-founded Arvo Animation (founded in July 2017). Considering that this is the first time both studios are doing a major production work, I felt that it was done well. Not the greatest, but certainly not Hoods Entertainment-level bad. Even though their works are outsourced (like just about every anime), my first impressions are closer to the levels of high-tier Silver Link and low-tier Brain&#039;s Base. Artwork was inconsistent and rough at best, but at some points did it manage to pull out nicely. Same goes with the animation, stiff and unconceiving, but when compared to the original manga source, it fits, and that&#039;s all that matters.<br />
<br />
On the musicality side,  the OST is somewhat lacking, but for all intensive purposes, it did its job adding (mostly) into the comedic moments, and tying into the anime gives it a rather generic extent that has both hits and misses. As for the OP and ED (by Furuhashi, Ogata and Takemoto), they are decent-sounding, fit into the themes nicely which gives the overall series a non-serious, laidback feel. Or maybe it&#039;s my senses telling me wrong that it&#039;s good.<br />
<br />
Whatever the case, love it of hate it, BokuBen is defintely one of the hidden gems of the lackluster Spring season, a worthy 13-episode series that shows how even minor companies can pull off a major work, even with the backing of director Yoshiaki Iwasaki, of works like Last Period, Love Hina and Zero no Tsukaima (1st and last seasons).<br />
<br />
Regardless of how this series turned out in its full-on generic-ness, this was quite the watch that turned out fine. Here&#039;s hoping Season 2 (announced just the day before this review) will be more of the same, and the confirmation of one of the waifus being Yuiga&#039;s partner (or it could turn out to be like the last moments of The Quintesstial Quintuplets on who Fuutarou married which Nakano).

    Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai boasts everything about an unusual time in high-school. This anime can make you feel a whole lot of emotions based on your situations in real life and how &#039;relatable&#039; they can be. Personally, I loved it, it was addicting, funny and more importantly interesting to watch. The soundtrack is awesome, there&#039;s alot of work gone into thinking of fully developed characters for each person featured. This anime was amazing, and there has not been anything like it. A burn for this anime was the clear ending and the obvious boring storyline to the last few episodes of the season, it

It has great production value, enjoyable characters, and a hilarious story line.<br />

I haven&#039;t see harem-comedy be this intense since Gamers! and School Rumble. I honesty<br />
did not expect myself to laugh as much as I did while watching this show (and I haven&#039;t<br />
laughed or smiled in weeks).<br />
<br />
To underline the show, it has a trio-harlem, with two other candidates. It doesn&#039;t just center in<br />
a school, it also shows adult themes such as work, which is a rare delight. If you love slice of<br />
life shows, give this a watch. <br />
Towards the end, even I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review355930">
        had trouble deciding which of the leading female characters was the<br />
best choice for the main guy. <br />
<br />
Also, this anime is very impressive being done by two lesser studios. I guess Japan has no <br />
shortages of talented artists! Great show, high recommend.

    Well...<br />
If you&#039;ve never seen a harem anime before Bokutachi wa benkyou ga dekinai isn&#039;t the worse pick you could take. But if you have, you are likely able to predict all of the plot in advance. As someone who has seen frankly too many series of this type, the plot was simply eye-wateringly boring.<br />
<br />
And there is of course the fact that this is based on an ongoing manga and is only 13 episodes long season. As any veteran will tell you, this means that the plot and relationships will advance absolutely nowhere. Plenty of tease of progression but all of it never amounts to anything.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310519">
        Most often this type is just meant to tempt viewer to buy the manga, so fully expect the last episode on the note of: &quot;Our crazy groups hi-jinks have only just begun, Teehee!&quot;

    Really funny anime. I was scared at the start with the harem but it turned into a really fun and enjoyable one. The story is not like the greatest in the universe, just a guy who help his girl companions to study, the characters change quite a lot during the first season from the start to the end, they get some develop and is pretty good. The art is great, not a ton of fan service which make it even better (yes, we all love fan service except when it&#039;s all that can give us an anime and then we hate it). Can&#039;t wait for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317316">

    Another series of an average teenager who becomes a teacher and casually gets a harem. It is practically the generic series that we have seen many times.<br />
 His style is nice and very simple, having all the same faces, nor has history and less character development, being simply an episodic comedy where they will show us erotic scenes all the time. The characters are so unoriginal, that we can classify them by archetypes: Nariyuki as the kind and silly protagonist, Fumino as the insecure, Rizo as the antisocial or the one who has trouble understanding people and Uruka as the childhood friend. But this is not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326988">
        enough for the series, so they add more characters like Asumi, the one that makes fanservices and a teacher.<br />
 Unfortunately, it is a series that goes for sure, with a predictable and innocent comedy, erotic scenes too explicit and such a superficial development, that you prefer to skip it. But if there is something that seems curious to me, it is that the girls have a special talent that they will not use throughout the story, so we realize that that detail does not contribute anything.<br />
 So I will take advantage of the fact that in these anime they always usually compete for which one will win and I will place my bet, Fumino (the one with blue hair) will win.

    Do you smell it? The smell of salt spreading all over the keyboard and the sweat of angry internet users. Do you hear it? The sound of a keyboard being furiously used and the disgruntled noises. Do you see it? The sight of avid internet users defending themselves on the internet. For you see, we are entering a war. A new war. Yet a war we have seen many times. It is The War of the Waifus. <br />

Sit back, relax and barricade your house to protect yourself from the avid swarm of haters of your chosen best girl as I present to you the anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311720">
        review of We Never Learn. Lets begin. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
<br />
Nariyuki Yuiga strives himself in his studies to become a top student and provide a better life for his family by getting a VIP nomination to help cover all of his university Intuition fees. One day, the opportunity arrives to obtain the VIP nomination. But there is a catch. He must tutor the school’s top two students, Fumino Furuhashi and Rizu Ogata, and help with the subjects they are weak at in order for them to pursue their dream careers. With the VIP nomination on the line, Nariyuki must help them improve their grades before time to submit their university application runs out. <br />
<br />
What was a simple case of helping out students with their studies slowly (and predictably) turns into a case of awkward meetings because the main female characters start to develop feelings for Nariyuki and Nariyuki is too dense to realise. This is amplified when you add characters Uraka Takemoto, Mafuyu Kirisu and Asumi Kominami to help set the harem. It mainly uses the tutoring aspect as a way at getting these female characters together and is mainly used to get to know more about them and why they want to succeed in the academic areas they struggle at. But slowly but, surely, the gimmick this show starts with is slowly not the focus of the show and what we get is another bog standard harem comedy with a diverse cast of female characters and a dense protagonist. It loses focus on what kind of story it wants to tell in favour of doing tropes and cliches that we’ve seen in other harem comedies. <br />
<br />
As for the comedy of this show, it’s one of those rare cases where the comedy arguably gets better as the show goes on as the awkwardness increases. That’s not to say that it wasn’t funny at the beginning because there were humorous moments but the humour only got better as the show got on. But it does over-rely on using the misunderstanding card to humour the viewer quite a bit and can start to get tedious but there were plenty of humorous moments throughout the show to make quite amusing overall, but it can get tedious at times. <br />
<br />
Another thing I criticise the story for is them balancing the screentime of the girls throughout the show. Rizu gets arguably pushed to the back as the show goes on past the halfway point. Whereas Asumi was introduced too late into the show despite being a breath of fresh air for this show. So it does have problems when balancing its girls and when we get to see them. Granted in Rizu’s case, we do get to see plenty of her in the first half and she moved aside for the other characters, but when you start adding characters, you need to start balancing it out. But the show struggles to do that at times. <br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 7/10<br />
<br />
Nariyuki does have aspects of his character and personality that would be considered cliched. The main aspect (which is shared among MCs in this situation) is him being dense to the girls’ feelings when it comes to love and such. Well not all of them, but some of them. I would say it is on the rather endearing side because all he wants is to make sure that he helps these girls in their studies. Sure there is the VIP nomination, but his attention rather turns to helping them, which causes them to develop feelings. But the genericness really does kick in at times and it really does feel like he does not want to act on this and is just let things happen. I know he’s focused on his studies but come on man. <br />
<br />
Now the female characters, the harem, is a diverse cast which is supposed to be because you want each of these girls to have their own personality and stand out of in their own way. What this show does great though is that each girl have certain qualities and quirks that make interesting and endearing and have set goals they want to achieve in life. So it’s hard to decide which girl is best because, Fumino is best girl, Rizu is best girl, Uraka is best girl, Kirisu is best girl and Asumi is best girl. This show is in a weird position where you can make a case why which character is the best one and you would have good reasons why. <br />
<br />
<br />
Animation: 7/10<br />
<br />
If I had to describe this show’s animation with one word, it would have to be, “Vibrant.” The show’s art direction is very colourful with plenty of striking scenes to make it vibrant. It matches the light hearted tone this show has so I see it as being very appropriate. There are the typical facial expressions and movements used to add humour to a scene by exaggerating it. Some of them are amusing though (Rizu’s pout face will always be adorable). Honestly, the show’s art style makes me feel comfortable, as if the usual day to day lives of our characters are something you can just relax and see how well they can get along with each other. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
<br />
I didn’t expect the ost to be as dramatic as it is but does consist of some of the more memorable soundtracks from the show. It is normally used when we get to know more about our characters to add some humanity to a scene. While there are other soundtracks that are used mainly for comedic timing the soundtracks for the show’s more touching scenes are more memorable. <br />
<br />
I very much enjoyed this opening mainly for its cinematography and how well some shots in this anime opening and has some very good animation. The song “Seishun Seminar” by study was a nice, uplifting song to get you hyped for the episode and timed well with some of the scenes in the opening. The ending sequence was also really good and is my favourite from this season, just beating out Isekai Quartet and Sarazanmai’s ending sequence. I’m a big fan of the chalkboard art style used to match the school setting. Study also does song; this time being called “Never Give It Up,” which was another nice uplifting song to match the tone of the show and is good to end off the episode. <br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion <br />
<br />
I will say that this show struggles to have an original bone in its body as the show consists of aspects we’ve seen from other shows like this. Its protagonist is generic at times and the whole gimmick of this show slowly boils down and is heavily downplayed so we can focus on the romance element. Yet it also has a good cast of girls and the shows animation is good to look at and a good soundtrack.  No doubt this show will probably be remembered for the arguments as to who was best girl in this series. But if you are looking for a fresh take on the harem comedy, then this ain’t it. It tried to be with the focus on these girls getting better with their studies, but the standard harem comedy tropes kick in and we get a show of two halves, one that is generic, the other is not. While it is entertaining and the humour is funny, it isn’t what I consider to be a must watch but it is the kind of show that it is best to formulate your own opinion on. While I did enjoy my time watching this show, there are aspects from the show that I didn’t like. But who knows, maybe my criticisms will be addressed in season 2 (hopefully). <br />
<br />
<br />
My personal enjoyment: 7/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall score: 6.8/10 Recommendation: Consider it

    Story - 6<br />
Expect a lot of filler. Romcoms aren&#039;t really known for progressing the main story. In a way I guess you can say the filler is the story. If you don&#039;t like it then don&#039;t watch.<br />
<br />
Art - 5<br />
Art is a step down from the manga, which is to be expected since you can&#039;t compare animating several still frames to drawing a few pages, quality drop is to be expected, but it&#039;s really evident in this series. It looks and feels generic. Nothing stands out.<br />
<br />
Sound - 4<br />
Generic, I feel like I&#039;ve already heard it before despite never hearing it. It sounds like any other soundtrack

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308708">
        you&#039;d hear in a romcom/slice of life.<br />
<br />
Character - 5<br />
Characters are underdeveloped, and it&#039;s mostly because of how bad the art is. There&#039;s not enough key distinction between the designs which I really enjoyed in the manga. Ogata was short and a bit chubbier, and Kirisu sensei was MUCH THICKER! Here the characters all look the same physically, only their hair color is what stands out the most between designs.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 5<br />
I don&#039;t enjoy watching this, but it&#039;s bearable.<br />
<br />
Overall - 5<br />
They really butchered this adaptation. It feels really generic. It doesn&#039;t have the impact I expected it to have from the source. <br />

    It is often said that people always look for originality, innovation or freshness in what they consume. But the truth is that even if we normally look for new experiences or ingenious turns in what we already know, we are creatures of habit and every so often we return to what is familiar to us because it is our comfort zone. I mention all this because the series to which I dedicate this review is no wonder that reinvents the genre of romantic comedies to which it belongs, however, it has resulted in one of the series that I have enjoyed watching in this already

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319475">
        finished spring season 2019 (although it was a slow season, so it&#039;s not saying much in its favor).<br />
<br />
<br />
The work is therefore a romantic comedy, of those that throw comedy more than romance itself, of school atmosphere and harem type, with certain elements of ecchi, which tells us the story of Yuiga, a young man with low resources but very dedicated to his studies, to which the director of his school offers him a deal that is impossible to refuse, and in exchange for the boy to work as the tutor of two students and help them raise their grades in certain subjects, he will be awarded a scholarship that will facilitate his passage to the university, which is great for him due to the economic situation of his family.<br />
<br />
A task that would not seem too complicated, especially when the boy learns that his two students will be, Rizu and Fumino, two pretty famous girls inside the school due to his outstanding intelligence, the first being a genius in everything related to Mathematics and exact sciences, and the other an expert in letters, the problem is that despite this talent, the girls due to their future ambitions, they really want to stand out in the opposite field from which they currently shine, Rizu wants to be good in literature to be able to become a psychologist, while Fumino wishes to learn mathematics to fulfill her dream of studying astronomy, the two being completely useless in these areas, costing both of them to learn something no matter how much they study and repeat them, finding this way our protagonist in a very complicated situation that will have to go solving one step at a time, being friends with the girls that, at the beginning somewhat distrustful due to their bad experiences with previous tutors and teachers who surrendered with them very easily. While discovering how to be able to teach them in an effective way, and eventually seeing how his small task initially goes complicating more than it should with the entry into the scene of other females, among which are an athlete with problems to learn English, and a teacher who does not see with great eyes the decision of the girls not to develop in that what they are good.<br />

I would lie if I said that the story in this series is not basic, as it is. However, its charm is how it integrates their characters and clichés in a quite natural way despite the formulations that can result in their way of narrating the events. However, even if from the beginning the characters comply with a usual cliche in the romcoms so that you can easily differentiate them by the tropes they represent, they have enough personality to make them credible since everyone has their own ambitions and dreams. So, not only do they exist for romantic relationships and comic gags, but any trace of these is born during the interactions of the characters and how they begin to know each other more. It is nothing that makes it stand out in the huge list of romantic comedies and it feels the same as many I saw a decade ago, but it gives it enough identity to not feel like a project lacking inspiration, especially with all the editions it does the anime to adapt enough of the manga and thus include all the important characters. It&#039;s a simple romcom, but it&#039;s well executed to give simple light entertainment that doesn&#039;t want to be a drama or touch subjects in too much depth.<br />
<br />
<br />
When it comes to the technical work of the series, I have to say that even when it&#039;s nothing incredible, it does its job well. With some occasional fanservice, we have simple but easy to differentiate characters that usually blend naturally with the scenarios, what they do not have in animation they use it in personality and when it is not a memorable production, even as a joke, it has its specific moments that steal the show. All wrapped in a colorful and vibrant color palette.<br />
<br />
For its part, the soundtrack is similar, nothing to complain about but nothing particularly surprising. The work in the voices of the characters is satisfactory and the soundtrack is energetic, such as Go! Go! Atletic or 赤 点 先生 which allows the series to be easy to enjoy even if it is not particularly memorable in this regard. The opening of the series is called &quot;Seishun Seminar&quot; while the ending is &quot;Never Give It Up !!&quot; both being two cheerful melodies interpreted by the group of seiyuus of the series under the name of &quot;Study&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t have much more to say about this series. It is not innovative or particularly ingenious in its ideas, but it is a simple romcom that does not seek to be much more than that giving light entertainment. For the fans of this kind of works, it is a recommendation that I can easily make, but for those who look for something else or it is tired of these clichés, it is probably better to look for another series to watch, because no matter how well you drive satisfactory these clichés that are already decades old, is not for everyone. For my part I will wait to see how the second season goes, that when I feel nostalgic these series are a good watch.<br />
