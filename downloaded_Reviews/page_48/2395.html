    Haifuri, one of the WORST promoted anime of all time. Okay that might be exaggerating, but not a lot of promotion is of this anime I have to say this season and to be absolutely frank (not Dave, we don’t talk about Dave), it was infuriating. Why? Because it’s completely the opposite to what people think it is and it was in my opinion absolutely fantastic. <br />
Okay, short rant over, let’s get down to it since I’ve been itching to write a review but I wanted to finish the anime first and now that’s happened let’s get going with the review.<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
Unlike some people’s first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222020">
        impression of “this anime is a slice of life, loli anime with no plot (in both senses) at all”, Haifuri actually has an over arcing plot and story and it is introduced to the audience in the most dramatic way possible in the first episode. Now what is interesting about the story is the fact that it’s a semi-mysterious-esque plot line which is fairly fresh compared to say Girls und Panzer (I recommend that anime as well) which was a tournament based anime or KanColle, which has the generic story of “fight the bad guys because the narrator said so at the beginning”. Now there’s obviously the ideas of friendship power and team work in this anime as well which isn’t surprising but it’s not intrusive to the plot but rather helps the characters to overcome certain problems, which most of the time they can&#039;t overcome regardless of the friendship power and it’s these plot twists and subtle differences that make the story unique and interesting. However, I have to mention the fact that there are a two “filler” episodes in that there’s not really too much naval action and breaks the tension generated by the other episodes but they weren’t intrusive and helped to develop the characters so can’t complain too much.<br />
<br />
Art and Animation: 9<br />
The ships are really well animated and they do feel like the girls are on board a real ship with all of its related equipment and weapons. Explosions are also eye candy and pairs well with the sound effects. The ships move realistically, shakes and rides the waves like a ship would. The water animation is of note as well and makes you feel like they are at sea. If you just came for the battles and fights, you’ll be pleased as the weapons are also fairly well animated (torpedoes especially). If you came for the cute girls then you won’t be disappointed either. 31 cuties each with a different style to match their persona and all of them will leave at least some impressionable image in your mind. Although for some reason, it might just be me, but the ships seems to be in a higher resolution than the characters sometimes. However, it’s nothing too significant that can affect the enjoyment of the show.<br />
<br />
Sounds: 9<br />
OP is catchy and gets stuck in your head, ED is soft and calming. Both fits the theme of the sea very well. The sound track during the anime isn’t used to fill the silence but rather used to great effect adding lots of tension to the scenes. Those sound tracks can really get your heart racing during the fight scenes and your heart throbbing in some of the more emotional scenes, and trust me, the feels will hit you like a truck. Other sounds worth mentioning is the sound effects which are pretty good. You can hear the whistle of the shell getting louder as it get nearer to the ship, the heavy explosion during impact, the creaking of the ship under stress, the echo of detonations of torpedoes in the water and the list just goes on. All these sound effect adds more excitement, tension and action to the scenes and boy they feel satisfying.<br />
<br />
Characters: 7<br />
Now you might be asking why the low score with characters after the praises I’ve sung for in previous categories? Well it’s simple, the problem with casting 31 girls is the fact that there is definitely no way every single one will get developed to a significant degree that you can remember their names and their personas in a 12 episode season (hence this needs a second season please!). So some the supporting cast had very little to say and aren’t presented to us fully which is a downer. However it’s understandable and unavoidable with such a huge cast, but credit to where credit’s due, they did at least try to make every member of the crew memorable in the second to last episode. Now the positives is the fact that those characters that we do see often and remember more are developed very well. The MC, Mike-chan, goes through a series of transformations from slightly clumsy airhead at the start to full blown determined captain by the end, whilst the also uncovering some of the back stories behind her which was “interesting” (used “interesting” to avoid spoiling the feeling, go watch to find out). Shiro-chan, the deputy-captain, started off strict and harsh, but we all knew she was a soft person inside and eventually she shows it as the relationships between the characters grew. To name but a few more; Tama-chan, Rin-chan, Maron-chan, Mei-chan, all these had much differing personalities and each developed and grew in their own way as the story progressed and it really made the series lovable. Also there are two cats. (Personal favourite: Tama-chan)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
The entire series was enjoyable to me. Each episode made me yearn for more. The tension was brilliant and the story flowed nicely. The action scenes and battles were the highlights for me and was full of excitement and a joy to watch. The characters are definitely lovable and undoubtedly cute. The series was definitely the highlight of the season for me and I want a second season so bad! <br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
If you like cute girls, this anime will be your piece of cake whilst also be surprising.<br />
If you like military and battles, this anime will still be your cup of tea since that is the anime’s focus which is different from say GirlPan.<br />
If you like moe, give it a shot, but it won’t be the main focus, but I think you’ll enjoy some parts of it at least.<br />
If you like suspense, well I wouldn’t say it’s very suspenseful but there are elements of it.<br />
If you don’t like cute girls, then turn around and leave via the door behind you because there’s no way I can convince you.<br />
If you are looking for FANSERVICE, this anime WILL DISAPPOINT you to no end! So follow the cute girl haters out as well and go watch Strike Witches instead.<br />
<br />
Full speed ahead! Steady as she goes!

    You know, if there’s one title from the top of my head with a misleading promo poster, then High Fleet Girls would be the first title this year to be named. Initially, the series was promoted under the title ‘Hai-furi’ before the revelation that it’s more than just about “cute girls doing cute things”. Much, much more.<br />
<br />
Before starting the show, I think it’s also important to understand the background and setting of the story. It takes place in an alternate modern world although events from 100 years ago (shift in tectonic plates) has changed much of Japan. The country attempts to preserve territories and establish

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221867">
        costal colonies and cities. The primary focus of the story is about the Blue Mermaids, a group that is tasked to keep the sea safe and is also apparently every female student’s dream job. <br />
<br />
The series starts off quickly and reveals that a girl named Akeno Misaki (nicknamed “Mike”) with a big dream. She enrolls at an academy known as “Yokosuka Girls&#039; Marine High School” with the goal to join the Blue Mermaids. For the first episode, the show establishes that Akeno and her crew faces unexpected circumstances as they are accused of mutiny. Furthermore, Akeno becomes the captain of the destroyer ship Harekaze. Make no mistake though, the show has a rather serious vibe despite the misleading atmosphere. The crew faces against battleships armed with real firepower capable of destroying them. Furthermore, Akeno is a newbie with lack of experience and tries hard to earn the respect of her crew. In essence, the show makes it clear that it’s no joke and pushes the idea of naval warfare to a level that you may not be prepared for.<br />
<br />
Among the crew, there is a variety of characters. One thought that crossed my mind is how the show can fit characterization with so many. After all, introducing all the girls at once seems like a mistake because there’s nothing in particular that makes them stand out individually besides the main protagonists. Most of them seems to have generic characteristics as well ranging from being stubborn, class clown, nervousness, etc. It’s also hard to ignore the similarities between this and Girls und Panzer especially with how talent is developed from both series. In some ways, the show does a neat job at making each episode relevant with its premise. In other ways, I have to say that the character cast is perhaps just too big for its own good.<br />
<br />
Either way, you’ll probably find some characters from the series to be more noticeable than others. Besides Akeno, we have Mashiro Munetani, the deputy captain of Harekaze. Unlike Akeno, she seems more like the serious type that takes everything a bit too straightforward and even has a case of allurophobia. Then, there’s quiet girls like Shima Tateishi with elite gunning skills, Mei Irizaki with her passion to fight, Kouka Nosa with a theoretical mind,  and timid Rin Shiretoko with decent steering abilities. They make up the bulk of the characters’ screen time so keep in mind while watching their roles. What I also find insightful about the show is that it divides the Blue Mermaid crew well with division to make each of them unique. For instance, there’s the Bridge of the crew with their central command objectives, the combat unit with their fighting talents, navigation division with their abilities to navigate under any circumstance, engineering department for construct and repair, and Logistics for aid in operations. The point is that the show doesn’t neglect any part of the Blue Mermaid crew and makes each role important to ensure the team’s success. On the downside, there isn’t much concrete characterization. The sheer amount of characters for this one cour show just seems a bit too much and perhaps the most characterization we’ll get is between Akeno’s childhood with her friend.<br />
<br />
Between the story and the slice of life feeling, High School Fleet feels more like a marine school/military hybrid adventure. The show makes it clear that Blue Mermaid is in danger at times especially when combating other ships (the most prominent one being the infamous Musashi). At other times, it feels like a school floating on water. This is because of the inner storytelling that goes inside the ship with the girls living their dream job. They want to have fun while working so on occasions, there will emerge “breather” episodes to show their lifestyle. At other times, they must be prepared for what’s ahead. That is, one particular part of the story baffles me with the way it’s executed when it involves peculiar experimentations. I’m all in for surprises but that took me by storm, almost like the way that Akeno is taken by her unexpected role. For some, this could drive away viewers from further pursuing the series but for others, it may also spark more interest. In retrospect, High School Fleet is one of those shows that you’ll have to expect the unexpected. <br />
<br />
It’s an anime original first and produced by TMS Entertainment. For artwork standards, it’s fairly well done in terms of ship designs. This is important because it gives more viewers interest to see how they work. I’m also impressed by the way Harekaze is designed with its 12.7 cm/50 Type 3 naval gun turrets and MK 16 naval guns. The  5&quot;/54 caliber Mark 16 and Mark 37 also looks surprisingly realistic. In terms of character designs, it’s generally moderate with a decent effort and budget poured towards making the girls look adorable and professional. Remember, there are at least 30 girls on just one ship alone! Like most shows that takes almost exclusively at sea, expect fan service with an even inevitable “beach episode”. However, the show itself excels the most at combat choreography. Even the night battles gives a strong impression of what naval warfare about. And in essence, the series knows how to expand its limits to make the fights believable. <br />
<br />
On the subject of soundtrack, the show is crisp and knows what it’s doing most of the time. This is especially true for the intense battle orchestrated OST that really gets the adrenaline pumping. Character voices are also accurately portrayed to reflect their personalities and expressions. Remember, these girls are practically part of the military so it’s interesting to see how they react under extreme circumstances. The voice mannerism does just that. OP and ED theme songs are catchy as well that gives the marine vibes and cool atmospheric feeling. <br />
<br />
High School Fleet is like the love child of Girls und Panzer and Kantai Collection. If you’ve seen either series, then you may find yourself quite familiar with this show. Still, as an anime original, the show has its own merits with the storytelling, characters, and overall style. For the majority, the show is perhaps a refreshing idea by taking cute girls and put them on a warship for their adventure. For others, it may be more of a forgettable attempt to revolutionize the female gender role. Still, I’d give this show a try because it’ll be an experience that sails with high spirit.<br />

    So the show has been fairly standard. Nothing particularly great or terrible comes to mind. The plot was intriguing, and the characters are developed enough that I can partially invest myself.<br />
<br />
Up until this point there have been hints of something sinister and nefarious running in the background, driving the plot. We&#039;ve had some build up in tension, and we get a boat-fight as the climax of each episode. Doesn&#039;t really break conventions at all, but it doesn&#039;t drive us away. The third episode ends with a ray of hope that the protagonists might have some external allies<br />
<br />
And then episode 4 rolls out. We start the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review217631">
        episode by completely dissolving all the dramatic tension. We are alerted that the school, where they can hopefully solve the conflict, is only 26 hours of sailing away. Just over a day&#039;s journey. That leaves a large window for something to go wrong, but gives the impression that they are close to success.<br />
<br />
And then the entire crew falls into disarray because they&#039;re out of spare toilet paper. Further dialogue suggests that they are not right out, indicating that there is likely some in the bathrooms currently. They suddenly break into worry over their dwindling supplies, and there is talk about stopping in a nearby town to restock, despite the current ban on their ship from entering all ports other than the schools. This is the premise of the episode<br />
<br />
On its own, the shopping subplot isn&#039;t terrible. What makes it so, is that they just affirmed with the audience that they&#039;ll arrive at the school (where the ship would normally restock) in 26 hours time. That means that at this time tomorrow, the girls will be 2 hours away from salvation.<br />
<br />
Why on earth would they go on a shopping excursion!? Surely they have enough toilet paper to last them a day if they all choose to be as conservative as possible. They already indicated they have plenty of food, and even if they didn&#039;t, 26 hours is less than the 30 hour famine that many people take on in support of starving communities! If they&#039;ll be at the school soon, why would they risk stalling their journey for another couple hours just so that they can wipe with as much as they want?<br />
<br />
The first five minutes of episode 4 just absolutely shatter the suspension of disbelief. There is no reason why these girls would make such a stupid decision. I can&#039;t even finish the episode now, but I&#039;m fairly certain that attempting this risky excursion gets them caught, they enter into another sea battle (as that seems to be how every episode ends) to fend off the pursuers who found them, and the entire sequence makes it harder to return to the school (because solving a conflict before the end of cour would illustrate just how little content there is). <br />
<br />
If this is how they&#039;re going to try and keep things dramatic, it&#039;s not something I can watch. There is nothing more to keep me invested in the series, unless I just want to watch cute girls pilot a ship.

    HaiFuri of High School Fleet is an anime that happens in a near future where the ocean rise and flooded the coastal cities... In Japan the flooded make that they must build cities above the water and create the &quot;Blue Mermaids&quot; a kind of coastguard patrol the seas. <br />
<br />
The story =&gt;<br />
Above the premise of the Blue Mermaids we have a group of young girls who want to became Blue Mermaids to protect the sea. Our main character is Akeno Misaki, the captain of the Harekaze (An invented Kagero-class destroyer) the first episode is practically the introduction to the Harekaze, Musashi, the crew of the Harekaze...<br />
In

          <span style="display: none;" id="review233221">
        the first moment the plot looks like a normal high school story with slice of life  parts... until you get the last 5 minutes of the first episode... And change all the vision about the plot.<br />
I do not tell more about the plot because it&#039;s a great anime and don&#039;t feel ok if I make major spoilers<br />
<br />
The Art =&gt;<br />
Well... The ART in this anime is FANTASTIC. I mean, the details in the Harekaze is pretty good, the torpedo tube has very good details. The bridge of the ship has amazing details too... <br />
<br />
The sound =&gt;<br />
Well... this is better that experiment in yourselves.<br />
<br />
Characters =&gt;<br />
One of my favorites things in the anime it&#039;s that the  characters had a background, a past or goals to achieve. Something that give you the reason to empathize with for example... Akeno is the reason that she is so human in the terms that she think in her crew like a big family... <br />
<br />
Overall =&gt;<br />
I think that if you don&#039;t see this anime you must gave him an opportunity.

    All hands on deck!!!<br />
<br />
High School Fleet or Haifuri (which will be what LA will be calling it from now on) is another &quot;girls doing cute things&quot; this Spring 2016 however it&#039;s not focusing on misfortune, bread or motorbikes, but naval warfare a la Girls und Panzer.<br />
<br />
In terms of characters, considering the huge cast, you&#039;d think that the development to these girls are minimal at best and sure that is true as the majority of the characters gets something of a &quot;running gag trait&quot; however considering the screentime and teamwork needed in naval warfare, their screentime is plentiful. The majority of the character focus goes to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221920">
        the captain, Akeno Misaki voiced by Shiina Natsukawa, the vice captain with bad luck Mashiro Munetani voiced by Lynn, the German stowaway Wilhelmina Friedeburg voiced by Hiromi Igarashi and Misaki&#039;s best friend Moeka China voiced by Sora Amamiya. However where the character development goes to are the entire Harukaze&#039;s teamwork thus the relational teamwork helps with the naval warfare of this anime. AAAnd if your wandering, LA&#039;s favourite characters were a tie between Akeno and Wilhelmina.<br />
<br />
Now why the naval warfare instead of just naval fair?, this anime actually has a Cerberus syndrome early on as this anime has a mystery element to it making this &quot;girls doing cute things&quot; rather dark and intense but still having the atmosphere of a moe anime.<br />
<br />
The battles?...is actually the best thing about this anime and reminds LA of Girls und Panzer in this sense, sure the battles that the Harekaze cast isn&#039;t off the rails like Girls und Panzer did, but to be honest they were on the borderline of doing utterly insane naval moves, not insane, more &quot;innovative&quot;.<br />
<br />
The animation by Production IMS, is overall above average, from the character designs being &quot;moe&quot; and bright typical of the girls doing cute things anime genre but the battles are pulse pounding and gorgeously animated (sure it has CGI on the naval ships, but the CGI hardly ever irked LA).<br />
<br />
The voice acting range, well we have mostly &quot;moe&quot; voice actors, ironic due to the contrasting naval warfare, however there are some notable voice actors LA needs to point out, those being Hiromi Igarashi as Wilhelmina, not only because of her shy tsundereness, but her German accenting was rather outstanding, on the other hand we have the impressionist bridgehand navigator Kouko Nosa voiced by Yuuko Kurose as well as the ever-genki Maron Yanagiwara voiced by Natsumi Takamori the chief of the engine room came out as a standout and Natsumi Takamori took out as LA&#039;s favourite voice actor in Haifuri because of that.<br />
<br />
The ending gave a bittersweet yet impactful ending, the final battle was awesome with all regards with a small plot twist making that final battle even better, the yuri undertones helped immensely too. The bittersweet moment of the ending felt like a salute to the Harekaze as a character though. Overall the ending was just great.<br />
<br />
LA will be quick about the conclusion of Haifuri, if your a fan of Girls und Panzer and want something VERY similar, then watch Haifuri as that is the naval warfare equivalent of Girls und Panzer just with a mystery element to it. If that statement interests you, Haifuri is set to sail for ya!

    first for the story i&#039;ll give 9/10<br />
I really like the story, but but unfortunately i really dissapointed with the ending of the anime. the ending of this anime in my opinion is a little hanging. i don&#039;t want to give a spoiler here so just watch the anime and you will know what i mean. after all i really love this story<br />
<br />
and for the art i&#039;ll give 8/10<br />
the graphics of this anime are quite good and the movement of the characters is also quite smooth, but for some reason I feel unsatisfied with the graphics of this anime. but after all i still give 8/10<br />
<br />
for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410027">
        the sound i&#039;ll give 8/10<br />
I don&#039;t know much about the sound arrangement in an anime, but as far as I can see, the sound effects of this anime are quite good and the placement of the sound effects is quite neat.<br />
<br />
for the character i&#039;ll give 10/10<br />
because, i really like loli character who ride a battleship, and this is also an added value from this anime because the characters in this anime are quite cute and kawaii, and the different nature of them also makes this anime more interesting. after all i really love the character of this anime.<br />
<br />
for the enjoyment if i can give 20/10 i&#039;ll give 20/10.<br />
because i really like the comedy in this anime, maybe for some people the comedy is not so funny, but for me this comedy is really really really really good, and this anime and this anime became my mood booster anime because i always laughing no matter how many time i watch it.<br />
<br />
overall i love this anime so i&#039;ll give it 9/10<br />
why i give 9/10 its because the ending is so make me dissapointed.<br />
<br />
do i recommend this anime?<br />
OF COURSE YESS!! I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS ANIME!!<br />
<br />

    I swear 2 days ago the rating of this anime was 7.66 and I know it because I was comparing it to Girls &amp; Panzer&#039;s rating which was 7.63 so I was thinking something like &quot;ooh this anime is slightly better than Girls &amp; Panzer huh&quot;. The next day I checked it again and it was 7.33. Anyways, since this anime is now underrated, I will need to release my feelings that are about to burst here as this is the most thrilling and intense anime I&#039;ve ever seen in my life.<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10:<br />
<br />
The story overall is very thrilling and exciting, I was overwhelmed by every

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323360">
        episode including the filler episodes as well, the backstory behind the anime is also well explained and I like how they chose to use a realistic method to infect the crew in the ship instead of using supernatural method also makes the show feel more real although the action and strategies parts are the parts I enjoyed most in the show.<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
<br />
The art is also very good, there may be some tiny minor CGs that I spotted but I did not care anyways. The environment, the sea, the ship, the characters and most importantly, the battle were so beautiful and perfectly done. The sea&#039;s animation is stable, the ship moves realistically, the characters&#039; visual are good and the camera angles during the battle switches between both side&#039;s perspective so clearly that it makes me feel that I&#039;m in the battle with them.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
<br />
Tbh, I actually started watching this anime because I thought the op is the Kantai Collection&#039;s one and I liked it very much but when I heard high school fleet&#039;s op for the first time in 2nd episode I was blown away as I had low expectation for it since it wasn&#039;t the op I was expecting to hear but somehow it is even better than the Kantai Collection&#039;s op ( the climax is so gooooood). The soundtracks are also very suitable during the fight and the last episode&#039;s sound was indescribable.<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
<br />
I did not find any waifu here but I just want to say that there are so many characters in the show with each one having different unique personalities which seems quite hard to control all those character so perfectly. The characters all have a reasonable amount of screen time and their strong relationship and bonds makes the filler episodes are fun to watch.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed the anime and it was a thrilling ride for me and my kokoro was beating fast, I was completely into the show.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
<br />
This is the best action anime I&#039;ve ever watched so far and everything about it is very good, it even makes me want to read the Haifuri manga to know what happens next but I can&#039;t seem to find a manga website that has this manga in it. If you do know a website please tell me. Thank you for reading my review.<br />

    Kind of surprised by all the favourable reviews on this.... <br />
<br />
Ok first off I love ships, lolis and moe so when I initially saw this I was delighted thinking it would be girls und panzer meets Kancolle! But god was it was far from it and a chore to finish.... <br />
<br />
Basically I loved the ships, and the character designs but the characters themselves were all insanely annoying and the plot was just beyond stupid and so so frustrating at times. I would personally avoid and I&#039;m going to go into some more detail on why. <br />
<br />
BEWARE SPOILERS!!<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Ok so the story goes that lolis arrive at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review224045">
        this school where they are to be trained as Blue Mermaids, Japan&#039;s naval defence force. In an alternate modern timeline much of Japan has been submerged and has become a major naval nation with a huge and powerful fleet. To assure the rest of the world that their navy is only for peaceful and defensive purposes they have the ships run mostly by young girls. <br />
<br />
So straight away the lolis are assigned to WWII ships and sent out to some far off location to commence naval exercises WITHOUT ANY instructors/teachers or anybody older than about 14 on board. While the main lolis are given a destroyer equipped with training and live ammo, another group is given the Musashi! Yes! The Musashi as in one of the most powerful battleships ever made! Again also without anybody older than about 14! Why were they given the Musashi when surely it&#039;s a bit dangerous to be letting new recruits who are lolis handle never mind how expensive it was to run?? <br />
<br />
Anyway we could probably just go with the flow on this one and move along<br />
<br />
So all the ships go out to sea and somehow split up and then some rodents somehow get on board the ships that interfere with electronic devices within a mile radius when convenient and infect the crew with a virus that allows the rodents to exert mind control over them and thus cause them to become aggressive towards other ships and humans.... <br />
<br />
Anyway my first beef begins when the destroyer with the lolis who are all the misfits and low achievers of the fleet get into their first battle. While being attacked with LIVE ammo they lampoon and try act all comical just like the girls in Girls Und Panzer except in girls und Panzer they establish that it&#039;s a sport and somehow safe but here they are in a real battle and having moe banter without the slightest bit of concern for their safety. Mind you I guess they don&#039;t have too much to worry about cause nobody in the opposing ships during the entire anime can hit them beyond one or two grazing shots. <br />
<br />
So they eventually fire a training torpedo at the ship and hit it damaging it enough to get away. It then transpires that they somehow sink the ship and have been declared a rouge ship! That&#039;s the end of the first episode and I was interested bu then next episode they decide to just sail about the place and eventually they start heading towards some port a day or two away without explaining why they wouldn&#039;t just contact home base and explain that they were attacked without warning. <br />
<br />
So yeah I won&#039;t go too much more into the story as I&#039;ll be here all day but <br />
<br />
The characters are super annoying. The captain routinely leaves the bridge in the middle of battle to personally undertake dangerous missions often on her own while the ship is under attack. Surely the captain should stay on the bridge at all times during combat!? When this is pointed out, we&#039;re made to feel bad about it and that somehow the captain was right to do things her way. With a ship full of lolis wouldn&#039;t they have a team of girls to do these daring missions maybe led by the 1st officer?? At one point they actually do that when a ships is sinking and they have to perform a rescue mission but some asshole civilian on board the sinking ship tells the girls that there&#039;s still a little one lost in the ship without saying it was just a kitten. I love kittens but when a ship is about to sink I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a good idea to trick a loli rescue worker into risking her life and almost killing her. She seriously almost gets killed and when the loli and the kitten are luckily rescued, the person that told her to rescue the kitten tell her that they no longer want the kitten and dump it on her! &gt;_= <br />
<br />
So the deputy captain or first officer is mostly useless and the girl they entrust with steering the ship is terrified of everything. I mean why would she be assigned to steering the ship with she obviously has serious mental problems?? It just gets really really annoying. <br />
<br />
But oh yeah conveniently for the lolis on the destroyer they have this genius doctor (who&#039;s 12!) on board who eventually figures out about the rodents and makes a vaccine. Why was this doctor there and not with the elite students? Never explained. <br />
<br />
So anyway on their way back to base they run low on  toilet paper and rather than survive for 24hrs they go shopping on a shopping mall ship where naturally they get caught. Again they make no attempt to contact base let them know all that has happened. Luckily for them they are not shot on the spot and somehow they adults believe that something odd is going on. <br />
<br />
So the rest of the anime is the lolis on the destroyer going around to the various battleships under mind control and somehow stopping them and rescuing everybody on board. All the while the adults essentially do nothing the entire anime except get beaten when they do engage the battleships in combat. It&#039;s not even like the lolis on the destroyer are clever cause they&#039;re shown to be almost clueless.<br />
<br />
The one ray of hope is a German loli that joins the ship and seems to have a clue on how to run things but after  a while they mostly ignore her and jokes are made about her being a German?? <br />
<br />
Pretty much all the characters are OTT super happy and it just gets really annoying especially when they&#039;re in a dicey situation or just get news that friends are in danger.<br />
<br />
The story is just balls and they never fully explain how these rodents infect people or scramble electronic devices within a mile at certain times or why the cats are unaffected, or how they even got onto all the ships in the first place. There&#039;s no clever zany tactics like in girls Und panzer and even if there was the lolis are often in situations where if they get one direct hit they will all die and they lack of tension just drives me mad. <br />
<br />
Anyway my rant is pretty much over. The story sucks and the characters are too annoying. On the other hand the positives are the lolis look cute, the ships can be fun to watch at times, and it usually has decent animation and sound. For me this the worst anime I&#039;ve watched in the last 6 months at least and I&#039;ve seen a lot! This is neither Kancolle nor Girls Und panzer although it does do a poor job trying to be them sometimes.

    I love this anime, I love it.<br />
<br />
This is definitely one of my favorite anime of all time. I have rarely found such kind of enjoyment in anime, I enjoy anime, but this kind is very different. <br />
<br />
The story is very engaging, looks like the girls mutinied and are being designated as a rogue ship and is being preyed on by multiple ships attempting to neutralize the &quot;threat&quot; they possess, this was some real hype stuff, dunno, I just felt it. It was really fun with the story, but while I found the infection part pretty corny, I still did enjoy it a lot, being a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350605">
        turning point for the story, it was very fun!<br />
<br />
Art, ok, I get it. The artstyle of these girls are very, very cute. I know that&#039;s the point of the anime but it&#039;s really adorable. The animation is also top tier, CG girls were used in the anime, but only if you look close enough to notice.<br />
<br />
For the soundtrack... I can&#039;t believe I would have a song stuck in my mind for months!!!<br />
Haifuri OP introduced me to TrySail, easily became my favorite girl group or band or whatever you call that. High Free Spirits is very, very, very, catchy. It is too catchy it should be a crime. One of the best openings I&#039;ve seen and heard.<br />
<br />
I love Akeno&#039;s character, it&#039;s so cute, and then when she and her Deputy Officer chilled down, they easily had the best partner feels, and also that torpedo officer and the fire direction officer (sorry I forget names), also that secretary girl, all of them have really fun personalities, I love it. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment? 10/10 Of course, I really enjoyed this.<br />
<br />
Overall, if you love military things with cute anime girls, you will definitely love this. If you&#039;re in for the plot, you might enjoy this, if you&#039;re here for fanservice, or ecchi in a way, there aren&#039;t any, but if you&#039;re just looking for some lighthearted cute show? I don&#039;t think this is the right one, it does have some really hype up scenes and tense moments. But if you&#039;re just generally looking for anything to watch, I highly recommend. 10/10 <br />

    Aight, Haifuri has been an anime I enjoyed watching over and over again. The Anime had all my interests in one, Military (WWII/Mordern) School Uniforms pog and cute girls doing cute things. The story was odd but still funny in my opinion, I enjoyed all the battle scenes cause you rarely see good Naval Battle animes, in fact I really doubt there&#039;s multiple animes that is Naval Focused. At most it is there is Aerial Warfare or (Gate) which only includes the JASDF and the JGSDF [Aerial and Ground Forces of Japan Self Defence Force]. In Summary, I would love to see another season or

    Haifuri remind me a little of Kancole in more realistic setting. And this one is surprisingly good in many ways. If you expect this one will be shallow happy go lucky high school girls show, you&#039;ll got slap on your face when you watch it. And without too much BS or fan service, the story will progress immediately starting from episode 1 and 2.<br />
<br />
The plot itself is quite good, the conflicts are intriguing enough too keep me interested. The gap between the cuteness and dire situations feels just right. You&#039;ll find quite amusing ship crews here, and each with their unique characteristics. For me, all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263538">
        of them are likeable, and the entire crew get their screen time, some even showing character development, though it is not much. Of course some people will complain about how useless the adults here, or not so fond with loli solving everything, my advice is: look at the trailer or synopsis before watching, there are absolutely no reason to watch anime like this if you are allergic to cute girls.<br />
<br />
The best part of Haifuri is, the ocean battle! yes, this show is about battleship voyage after all (though it&#039;s supposed to be peaceful class training). Without spoil too much, the girls ship will face various type of enemies. And it&#039;s not about which one has the best weapon or bigger ship, various tactics will be involved, that&#039;s because our protagonist ship is not the best here. There are also other problems presented that might happen on the voyage (I&#039;m not expert in this part, as people of the land), like lack of supply, etc. which bring more variety other than battle, and there also relaxing moment for you to feast at moe and cuteness.<br />
<br />
To summarize, this is quality anime which might be underrated. It&#039;s recommended for anyone who like action but bored of shonen anime, because this one will be cuter. Of course if I want to nitpick at some plot hole or weird situations it might lower the fun while watching this, but why would I? 10/10 for the enjoyment<br />

    Maybe this is late. But, i want start reviewing when my entry up to 150 animes. And this is one of my masterpiece scored anime in my list<br />
<br />
Intro :<br />
Haifuri a.k.a High School Fleet... A School, Military, Action. FYI, this anime is my first military anime that makes me hyped about military. And of course, Moe material !.... Seems like Kancolle ? You can say it... But this is 10x greater than Kancolle.<br />
<br />
Misaki Akeno (Favorites Character, and waifu !! &gt;_&lt;) enrolled to Yokosuka High School. One of naval school that makes their students to be a Blue Mermaid. And of course her osananajimi (Chilhood Friend) China

        Moeka enrolled too. But, they are in the different warship. This because their test score. Akeno is going to Harekaze. A Destroyer Type warship. And Moeka in to Musashi. Battleship Type Yamato Class. Then, they start their naval training in the ocean. <br />
<br />
Just like that ? A normal CGDCT ?........ Of course not ! Remember Gakkou Gurashi (Scholl Life!) anime ? You will know how it feel if you had watched that.<br />
<br />
Story : 8/10<br />
I think... the story doesnt have any special things.... Normal plot, many minor twist, and filler are in there. The only things that makes this anime great is the unpredictable 1st episode. Firstly, i think i want to pick a millitary to my friend. But, when i got attached to the artworks. It can&#039;t flee from my mind. I enjoyed the story very much... And those CGDCT filler relaxed my eyes when the atmosphere is so serious. But many people maybe think... In which world, in the middle of big problem you lost all your tissue and then go shopping to get the tissue ?... Well, actually i dont care because i&#039;m a moe holic... Many plot holes is filling it... But i too enjoyed with those great naval battle so i never mind it<br />
<br />
Art : 10/10<br />
I think, Production IMS caught me off... Same Illustrator as Non Non Biyori... i can&#039;t deny that the art is so great ! Full of Loli ! I GOT MOEBETES ! Not only that... The detail of the warship... Interior, Hull, Canon, and those special effect... The best of all time... The colour very good, full moe chara, perfect brightness, and those goddamned good naval effect made this anime one of masterpiece artworks. 4 Thumbs for IMS<br />
<br />
Sound : 9/10<br />
OP High Free Spirit sung by Trysail succesed attach my ears. Make me listen it every time. ED ? I seldom listen it... But i dont hate it. OST ? Success makes me download it 90mb and played everytime i play World of Warship... And Sound Effect of course good. Maybe, nothing special. Many anime have same quality.<br />
<br />
Character : 8/10<br />
I could torture the illustrator about f*cking great artworks. But, 30 girls in a cour anime ? Of course the chara development doesnt good enough. You can see the development in Akeno, Mashiro, and Rin-chan. But, the director put many potential chara which can makes some people curious. Example, Kuro-chan. I see her as an antagonist because her sharp eyes everytime she look Akeno. But until the end of the show, it has nothing to do with the show...<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 9/10<br />
This is my #1 airing anime spring... Im really hyped waiting it... The naval and the Moe... I like it... maybe if you are the same type with me, a moe holic person... you will enjoy it eventhough you didnt enjoy the naval<br />
<br />
Overall : 9/10 but my animelist 10/10<br />
Moe, naval battle, great music, beautiful art... I&#039;m not naive but i appreciate the people in anime industry... some perfect score maybe not helped it but every things that makes me happy im highly salute it... Disagree ? Just make an animation doodle walking for 10 second. Review it by yourself...<br />
<br />
Closing :<br />
Thank you for read my &#039;bad english&#039; review. And actually, im an indonesian.

    I haven&#039;t had enjoyment out of a show like this for awhile. <br />
<br />
I was first introduced to this anime by playing World of Warships when they partnered with this anime and released two ships into the game. I eventually went and bought the Harekaze ship in game ( I believe in October) This is were it piqued my interest.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s kind of weird. You come into this expecting this to just be a silly cheerful show about anime school girls on ships. But within the first 2 episodes that expectation is completely destroyed.<br />
<br />
There is some things that don&#039;t make sense. Such as why would anyone put

          <span style="display: none;" id="review268490">
        High School kids in control of ships or why they would give a new student control of the Musashi the most powerful ship in the fleet.<br />
<br />
Things like this you can easily overlook. The show is good at keeping your attention. Especially with the size of the cast of characters. One of the biggest cast of characters i&#039;v seen. They are all fun and entertaining to have. There are some characters that go together really well. Hell, Sometimes it seems like there is some Yuri action happening. In fact for the show to be about ships there is a missing sense of Shipping happening ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <br />
<br />
Characters go together really well such ( Some of them i even ship)<br />
ShiroxMike<br />
Mii-chanxKoko<br />
<br />
It&#039;s also kind of weird cause one of the the first characters we are introduced too is Mike&#039;s friend when they are little but we see so little of her.<br />
<br />
Mike also has a sad past and i wish they would have done more with her. Such as one of her goals is to meet the Blue Mermaids that saved her as a child. Have the Principal set up the meetup as a surprise for Mike.<br />
<br />
There are also things that are kind of hard to buy for history buffs or just in general. Such as how no one is killed in all of this ( I do like that no one does, Cause it would have started making the show very dark and kind of ruining my opinion of it) How no modern day ships are even able to take out the Musashi. Also how a small little DD is able to take on so many of these ships.<br />
<br />
Also for some reason we see no Planes in this at all ( I think it might have been mentioned that planes don&#039;t exist in this world or something) But it seems weird when the reason why the Yamato (Musashi is a class of the Yamato ship) was sunk in real life was because of planes. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s also never explained why there is electrical interference with electronics on modern ships and modern weapons.<br />
<br />
The atmosphere the show makes with this being on one little boat is really nice and is probably why i like this so much. <br />
<br />
The last two OVA&#039;s were also really nice and gives hope of a 2nd season. I don&#039;t know what it would even be about but i would watch it without hesitation.<br />
<br />
In the final battle when the Principal was about to sail out on her ship to fight the Musashi i thought it would be a big reveal such as her ship being the Iowa ( USS Missouri) Something big and awesome like that happening i feel was missing from the ending.<br />
<br />
They use CGI at times and it helps with the feel of the episode. So that was a nice touch it also helps make battles look all the more badass.<br />
<br />
Overall a great show that i hope for a 2nd season

    Objectitly, Haifuri is not worthy of a 9. In no way.<br />
The animation is not especially good, so is the music and backstory is just plain stupid, it did feel like the dumbest excuse imaginable to put schoolgirls on warships, it felt like Girls und panzer but even more poorly executed.<br />
However this anime is more than the sum of its parts, I really enjoyed it like I enjoy very few animes. <br />
I won’t spoil the story but characters do face high stakes like death, some bits are kind dark, it is question of treason, mutiny.<br />
Yet despite that the anime go from serious to plainly stupid. “We

          <span style="display: none;" id="review269631">
        face serious charges for mutiny, we may die because people are after us, oh yeah and now we are out of toilet paper, so let’s risk our life to get some” (no kidding, seriously it is part of an episode)<br />
However, despite this, it is surprisingly enjoyable, and the marine battle are just plain epic, it has been written by people who clearly know their subject no simple kancolle of World of warship fans but true warship otaku.<br />
Character development and relationship building between the girls if also quite enjoyable, little bit unoriginal and predictable but I still managed to like it and did grow fond of all the differents girls.<br />
<br />
This anime is worth watching for the final episode alone, the final is just plain epic. I mean, for me it was final episode of a original gainax anime in term of epicness, action and emotion. The final was so right. And that is part of why I rate this anime so high. I really enjoyed myself with Haifuri.

    After trying to find a military themed anime that I want to enjoy, I can vouch that Haifuri is my one and only prefrence. Sure the plot has flaws here and there but no matter how flaw it was, I still loved it for various reasons. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Remember folks! This is not a story about girls having naval tournament like senshadou in Girls und Panzer, nor its a Kancolle &quot;bizzarre&quot; animation sequence anime like one person thought it was. This is a story of students aiming to become Blue Mermaid, maintaining the safety of the nation&#039;s territory from invasion and other unwanted incidents. A certain dialogue

          <span style="display: none;" id="review272890">
        in an episode hinted they were trained since middle school, or perhaps even before that. <br />
<br />
So it means that what the girls are doing are for their future professional occupation and not for playing around. So believing that this is a funny-happy-go-lucky story especially like Girls und Panzer will leave you disappointed. Also this is not about saving a school, so don&#039;t get your hopes on that kind of thing. <br />
<br />
However there are flaws just like every other stories or animes. But I don&#039;t want to mention it here to avoid unintentional spoiler. But if you don&#039;t really mind it surely you can just brush it off. The story alternate between serious and casual. So if you want a hardcore stuff where everyone are arguing against one another in a ship, you might stop watching this kind of anime and start watching movie like Crimson Tide, The Yamato Men or perhaps real historical warfare. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
The reason I like Haifuri the most and put it in my lifetime favourite is the variety of characters; from the timid to annoying one. Surely there are a lot of anime that has this kind of variety. But having around 32 characters in a single place (ship) is a point for me because it showed how each of them compromised one another; they argue, agree, obey within the chain of command. It indirectly created the &quot;comrades of the sea is a family&quot; vision; they slowly become close to one another and become a &quot;family&quot;. Almost all of them are being developed as the series went on. Only few had little development which is a little bit of flaw. <br />
<br />
How they were assigned to their post which seems unfit may be due to their exam scores (this is just a theory). Just like Akeno who are unfit to become a captain and she herself believe that. But she had to abide the position assigned to her due to being unable to decline and change her position directly in short amount of time. So rather than thinking the problem with the characters&#039; position you ought to see how they tried to developed their self-esteem and personality.

    I largely knew what I was getting into when I watched this and I knew it wasn&#039;t going to be anything great, but a friend wanted to try it. It was pretty much exactly what I expected it to be, and it&#039;s probably exactly what you expect it to be as well. So lets get into this.<br />
<br />
Story: Whatever, the plot is stupid, who cares, it just serves as a vehicle for having the ship and crew do things. There are many major plot conveniences that don&#039;t really make sense, a number of threads and implications that go nowhere and ultimately the plot is kinda silly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277045">
        and not well explained. But we know who&#039;s going to win from the start anyway. The plot does it&#039;s job just about, it&#039;s not so horrendous as to particularly offend me but it doesn&#039;t really stand up to much scrutiny and it&#039;s ultimately not that interesting. It makes the girls go places and do things in their ship and get into fights.<br />
<br />
Art: The character designs are all very cute, I just wish they&#039;d had more chance to shine but we&#039;ll get to that later. The animation is pretty good and the 3D for the ships doesn&#039;t look bad. All in all the show looks pretty nice and is well presented with some nice details. On the other hand we&#039;re not talking really exceptional art on par with the best, but I think the show looks very solid. It&#039;s never really ugly and the main point, the cute girls, are very cute.<br />
<br />
Sound: I don&#039;t really remember much in the way of the music and I didn&#039;t find the other sounds in the show to be overall very impressive. I don&#039;t really remember how the voice acting was, which I assume means it was at least ok, possibly solid. The guns could have done with a little more oomph to them. Realistic or not, they just didn&#039;t sound that impressive especially in the big battle where lots of guns are going off.<br />
<br />
Characters: Oh boy, the characters. There are a lot of them. And few of them get any character development and for those that do it seems... a little incoherent. Aside from the captain and vice captain, they all really only get handfuls of screentime each and I never felt like I got to know any. It&#039;s a shame because I actually think a lot of these girls have potential. Which actually surprised me. But I think if there were some sort of spinoff shows that focused more tightly on sections of the cast (and gave them due respect), that could be a thing that I would actually like. I ended up wanting to like a number of these girls but a total lack of screentime and character exploration meant that I just didn&#039;t really end up caring. It says a lot that 7 episodes in to the show my friend and I had this exchange:<br />
17:16 - Person012345: what&#039;s the main character&#039;s name?<br />
17:16 - [XXXXXXXXXX]: i cant remember<br />
<br />
The main characters that really got any development were the captain and her vice captain. I feel like they were trying to show the captain becoming more mature and respectful, by learning that her place is at the bridge and not running off on crazy adventures whilst leaving the crew to handle themselves, but I wasn&#039;t really feeling the development, it felt kind of forced and then it also got contradicted by the main person pushing for it towards the end. I suppose that was to show her becoming more relaxed, but overall it felt conflicted and neither of these really felt like natural progressions of the characters. It again may be because they couldn&#039;t even explore their characters in any real depth so we didn&#039;t feel it. Also, everyone on the ship sort of felt like they bumbled into everything and the only character who was having appropriate reactions to everything happening was the girl who cried about everything (who I came to end up wanting to learn more of, but alas). Everyone else seemed more concerned that they might run out of toilet paper than the fact that they were wanted fugitives who faced god knows how long in prison, or a cold watery death.<br />
<br />
For me the characters are the core of any show, but especially one like this that is character focused and I feel like the ball was dropped. They tried to cram too many girls into the picture so that everyone could have a waifu and as a result, really couldn&#039;t do anything with any of them in adequate detail despite the characters actually having potential. I also didn&#039;t feel like they treated the characters with as much respect as they routinely had them dressing up in swimsuits or other outfits so we could gawp and when coupled with the lack of actual exploration of who they are as people, it leaves them feeling like objects to be fapped to rather than beloved characters who we&#039;re meant to care about.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Well, I mean, I managed to get through it. Though if I had been watching alone I would have dropped it without a doubt. It wasn&#039;t absolutely terrible, but I don&#039;t really consider it worth watching. Again, the show is what it is and if you&#039;re here you probably understand what it is and what it&#039;s trying to be.<br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;m feeling a little generous and it did have it&#039;s moments, so this show is a low 5 for me. On another day I might give it a high 4 but I think it solidly straddles the 5 line. Not really worth the time, but it also didn&#039;t ruin my week.

    I started watching this series for the fine ladies<br />
<br />
I ended up watching it for the plot after a few episodes<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
To be honest, I thought that Haifuri is an anime similar to Gochiusa or K-on (CGDCT), but i was heavily mistaken. I never expected a very good plot for the anime at all.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
The art is good in general (especially well done on character design, but i&#039;m putting these points to characters), but even if it&#039;s cute and fluffy, it doesn&#039;t exactly fit so well with the intense battles and it makes the fighting a bit less exciting (don&#039;t get distracted by the lolis)<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review228200">
        opening is very catchy (HIBIKE!) as well as a good ending.- not much to be said here<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
.....<br />
There&#039;re a lot of lo- characters in Haifuri. All the characters have their unique points (similar to Assassination Classroom) and they are all adorable.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
As much as i would love to give a higher score for enjoyment, I believe that the comedy is a bit shallow and hard to understand sometimes. There are some parts where i burst out in laughter but that&#039;s bout it<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
Why 10/10 even though the average would be nowhere near it?<br />
It&#039;s definitely not because of the lolis, totally not.... totally :D<br />
<br />
The main reason why I gave this series a high score is because of my personal preference, mostly. I really love the cgdct things but if you add a great plot to it then for me, it&#039;s just like icing on a cake.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: Watch it, and if you don&#039;t like it, <br />
still watch it (jk, don&#039;t in that case)

    I really love this anime; why? because it&#039;s very unique, infact; I have never, ever seen a battleship based anime, props to them for making it unique!<br />
Story: 8- Now I won&#039;t get on this one too hard, but it&#039;s kind of choppy, time stamps, dates, you know, but I like how *spoilers ahead* Sorry :/ They get into battles a lot, now they somehow just kind of regain their lost foods, weapons, and ya know; stuff that went missing on the ship before, but it&#039;s a good overall story, the mutiny, the battles, it&#039;s good, I like it!<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 9- I enjoyed the ships, the water,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review233660">
        the characters, everything! very smooth animation and detail to small things, thats why I like it!<br />
<br />
Sound: 10- I can&#039;t complain, really well done sound with explosions, characters; except they all sound alike basically!<br />
<br />
Character; 9 Each character has their own personality which I do like in my animes I watch, and not the same old boring characters. Each character has a growing emotions to one another, and bond with them, rather teamwork, or in general!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10 I liked this anime so much, I put it in my favorites :3, really should get more attention, I loved this, it&#039;s very unique, satisfying, and builds teamwork

    Story: 3/10<br />
The story was all over the place. I thought it was going to be a typical schoolgirl anime with ships and they would go on missions, but then they have to fight a virus?? It felt like they were making it up as the story progressed and they were trying to drag it out.<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
I loved the art. It was consistent and the ocean looked very realistic, which was a nice touch. I also liked the designs of the ships, although some of them looked very similar.<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
I liked the opening song and the battle music, but that was it.<br />
Character: 3/10<br />
Too many characters. I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221951">
        felt like they tried to focus on too many at once. I didn&#039;t like Misaki as a main character. She was too indecisive and only cared about saving Moeka. I&#039;ll give her a pass, though because it didn&#039;t make sense how the school made first-year students the captains of some of the ships. How would the higher-ups know if they&#039;re ready to be leaders or not? It&#039;s obvious that she wasn&#039;t fit to be captain of the Harekaze.<br />
Enjoyment: 5/10<br />
I only enjoyed the action scenes.<br />
Overall: 5/10<br />
It was okay. That&#039;s all I can say. The anime tried too hard to be a moe and action anime at the same time and it didn&#039;t really work. Honestly, I would&#039;ve liked it more if they focused solely on the action. There&#039;s also some drama that I wished could&#039;ve been more explored upon, but it&#039;s either quickly resolved or never developed. For example, there are a few students that questioned Misaki&#039;s leadership and there were times where I seriously thought they were gonna mutiny. That would&#039;ve made the anime so much better. But they didn&#039;t and that&#039;s disappointing. I would recommend this to people who like action as long as you ignore the stupid parts of the anime.

    High School Fleet, or Haifuri, may be perceived as a cute moe anime at first glance. Although retaining some aspects of a CGDCT anime, such as when the girls have some down time, the show creates a serious, fast moving environment that is a lot more serious than, say, Kantai Collection, for example. Also having a much, much larger variety of crew compared to Arpeggio of Blue Steel, the cast in Haifuri really feels like a real ship&#039;s crew. With characters ranging from logistics to artillery officers to the captain herself, the characters manning the ship take their job seriously, as would anyone in a

        life or death situation. The art style is refreshing too, as the characters were designed by Atto, the creator of the Slice of Life Non Non Biyori. The OST is great, featuring an amazingly catchy OP by TrySail. The characters were extremely enjoyable too, but 1 cour to develop so many characters is hard to do, so it&#039;s understandable. Nevertheless, it was easy to remember each character, her role on the ship, and at least one defining trait. Personally, my favorite character was Irizaki, the ship&#039;s CTO. Overall, this show is great, and anyone who is looking for a serious Military show with some aspects of moe mixed in there, definitely give it a try.
