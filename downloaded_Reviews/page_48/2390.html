    Pretty girls in sports wear that unveil every inch of their sexy bodies with mind-boggling efficiency. Muscle-bros so big you need a rock climbing permit for a piggyback ride. When gym enthusiasm collides with anti-broscience humor, you have Dumbbell, the funniest ecchi comedy since Prison School. However this is not an entirely comedic series (nor is its ecchi pushy in case someone minds), rather it can also be very serious and motivational at times. <br />
<br />
What the series manages to do with its cast is the impressive part because with simple character traits it manages to deliver smooth and hilarious comedy. We have characters such as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313719">
        Akemi, who is really into big muscle boys. She has a downright muscle fetish and whenever she sees some awesome gains, her eyes turn into hearts and she starts drooling all over the place. Our real main character (Hibiki) is in bad fit. All she does it eat candy and slowly get fat, but for her, it&#039;s time to change and start her adventure towards ideal sexy body! Her role in the comedic narrative is one of the best and most relatable for anyone who has started gym and once been a newbie. Her reactions, learning-curve and muscle pains are both hilarious and accurate. We also have some less significant side characters such as Ayaka who is tanned, petite, and in good fit. She mainly exist there to fill some ecchi quota and also to offer variety, because in this series, it&#039;s important that there are gym-goers anywhere from over-weighted newbies to body builder pros. As a whole, the series has many more characters than I listed down and does splendid job offering accurate jokes that are relevant to each gym-archetype you&#039;d see when going to one.<br />
<br />
Men! No pretty girls without manly men! When bodybuilder pros lift weights, the execution, the determination and the seriousness is so awe that it becomes funny. This is one of those series that can be funny and serious at the same time because even the jokes have relevant substantial value. It&#039;s kind of like self-irony. The female casts&#039; reactions and the anti-broscience take on gym is pushed so far and to such extreme that the series reaches a point where it becomes motivational. While the series has not yet overtaken r/fitness, it&#039;s easy to say that it is going to change some of its viewers life and make them do sports. I am training my butt as we speak.<br />
<br />
Does it have a story? Already gave that away. School girls want to train. The story itself is highly slice of life oriented. These girls are each others friends and hang out/have life outside gym as well, so it&#039;s pretty based from that part. Production values? The art itself is surprisingly decent. Comedy delivers due to good use of production values that are simple but arguably exactly enough for a series of this sort. Opening song/animation is welcoming and memorable. You can pretty much catch the required mindset by simple watching the OP. Not the highest values in the industry, but good decisions have been made. <br />
<br />
As far as entertainment value goes, this is the funniest and sexiest show you can watch this season. Pure, simple, genuine entertainment. I pray for the uncensored version and recommend giving this a try. Some people seem to like it ironically and praise it because it&#039;s not cool to say that this show is actually legit good, I guess, but it really is.

    How many anime have you watched or even heard about, whose main narrative is about exercising? Heck, how many shows in general, anime or otherwise, have you come across that have exercising as their premise? In this time of generic anime filled with clichés and predictable outcomes that bore you to death, Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? (How Heavy are the Dumbbells you lift?) comes off as a breath of fresh air. From dumbbells to girls flexing their bodies and showing off their curves and “macho” guys posing with their bulging muscles ripping their clothes off, this anime has it all in abundance. Which other anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317611">
        can claim to have all this and then execute it in a way that actually makes every minute of every episode a joy to watch? Not any I know of.<br />
<br />
At first, I didn’t honestly expect this anime to deliver on the title. But it pleasantly surprised me not only with actually giving me something unique to watch for once, but also twisting the common comedic tropes into something that feels exceptionally refreshing. Not to mention that the information provided about the exercises and the biological structure of muscles is very accurate. What brought a smile to my face every time was the depiction of common problems that newbies have when starting out with gym equipment as it reminded me of myself doing similarly when I began hitting the gym for the first time. <br />
<br />
The story starts off with Hibiki Sakura, a high-schooler attending an all-girls school and has an uncontainable craving of unhealthy food, wanting to lose weight. Of course, she has a hidden motive. She wants a boyfriend. And to her delight, there’s a new gym that opens up in town for her to pursue her fleeting wish of getting slimmer. Simple enough story. But where Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru truly shines is taking this and turning it into a ride filled with supremely entertaining characters introduced throughout the run of the 12 episodes.<br />
<br />
For the rest of the cast cast, we’ve got a group of normal-looking teenage girls who for one reason or another, join the Silverman Gym. Akemi Souryuuin is the model student of Kouyou Girl’s Academy; excelling at studies as well as sports, and to the surprise of many around her, being a fitness freak. She’s a bag of one shock after another due to the unexpected personality traits that she reveals. Next, we’ve got Ayaka Uehara, Hibiki’s best friend and the daughter of a retired pro-boxer. Her personality is probably the most unsurprising. I mean almost every other character apart from her is not what they look. She’s also probably the most uninteresting of the main cast because of that. <br />
<br />
And then we have the only male of the main cast and just about the only named guy for about two-thirds of the anime, Machio Naruzou. His name should really have been “Macho” and I doubt people would’ve complained because it’s the only accurate way to describe him. Full of charisma and even more muscles, he’s the main trainer of the Silverman Gym. With his clothes on, he comes off as a normal, cheerful young man. Although he is anything but that. Not in a bad way of course, because his antics of ripping his clothes to pose every other minute never gets old. “Sido Chesto!&quot; <br />
<br />
Then, we have Satomi Tachibana, a teacher without a boyfriend who has a big secret, and Gina Boyd, the foreign student, to round off the main cast. They both have their quirks which are the cause for a lot of entertainment but since they’re introduced towards the middle of the season, it’s probably better to not talk about them too much here.<br />
<br />
The animation is surprisingly good and full marks to the studio for making the best use of their budget by focusing on the scenes that needed more attention. Some of the Jojo-style stills are inserted at just the right time to make me laugh out loud. Would better animation have made these scenes more memorable? Most definitely. However, that’s true for almost any anime (bar those produced by ufotable of course.). The opening “Onegai Muscle” is sung by the VAs of the characters themselves, primarily by Machio and Hibiki’s Vas. And it’s just perfect. Same with the ending and the voice acting. Unless I nitpick, I don’t really see a reason to complain about it.<br />
<br />
Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? certainly has tons of entertainment value, which is one of the most important factors in any form of media. Having said all of this, this is an anime that may not be for everyone. Do you dislike over the top comedy and guys showing off their bodies every few minutes? If so, this might not be for you. Even for those people though, I’d say you should give this a try by watching an episode and finding out for yourselves if it suits your fancy. I think this show will keep most of you entertained.<br />

    There are Anime that try to be the jack of all trades, and they very much succeed in doing so. Then there are the Anime that try to do the same, only to fail miserably and fall flat on their faces. This Anime is not exactly the latter, but it comes close to being so, and why is that you ask? Because it tries to do so many things, but it doesn’t quite hit the mark with what it does, and it becomes obvious to the audience that it is trying it’s hardest to stand out, rather than just be a silly ecchi disguised as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317671">
        a sports Anime. First of all, it tries to be an infomercial about sports, yet it doesn’t quite succeed in doing so since it’s busy trying to be a comedy as well. The comedy is not that funny or bone tickling anyways, since it is the same redundant gag repeated many times during each episode, and the whole gist of this Anime overall is being an ecchi that isn’t really an echhi, and that it is disguised as a gym infomercial or a slice of life about girls training.<br />
<br />
The comedy lands solidly due to the good production values and the decent delivery, but other than that there really isn’t any other merit to said comedy, since it gets repeated many times over until it turns trite. The production values are decent, from the decent animation, to the welcoming color palette, to the fine soundtrack, and there aren’t any complaints towards them. They are fine as they are and serve the show well enough.<br />
<br />
As for the characters, they are the typical, run-of-the-mill slice of life characters. They aren’t really anything to write home about, yet they aren’t really one dimensional per say. Hibiki is not really a poorly developed character, she is nice as she is. However, Akemi is the basic rich girl who lacks anything that would make her stand out. Think of any typical and plain rich character you could find elsewhere and you will get her. Characters aren’t really bad, but they border on tame for most of the time, and they feel like they are epitome of slice of life characters.<br />
<br />
This Anime is a good Anime for the ecchi fans out there. Panty shots, thigh shots, gigantic tatas and everything else an ecchi lover wants, they can find it here. It is hot and it most certainly delivers regarding that aspect. The characters are good looking enough as they are, and that alone will attract ecchi lovers, and the fanservice most certainly delivers as well. The unfunny faces could turn out to be a problem though, and they ruin from the immersion of enjoying the sexiness that this Anime gives off.<br />
<br />
Overall, this is a fine Anime. What really hinders it from being good is the fact that it tries so hard to be the jack of all trades, yet it only succeeds in one thing, and that is being sexy. It wasn’t a bad watch at the end of the day, it was a fine watch as it is, though I think that ecchi lovers will enjoy this one far more than I did, even when some unfunny bits are to be expected here and there.

    Honestly. I was unsure about this at first as with the genres that were listed. But they honestly aren&#039;t a problem at all when it comes to this anime. It&#039;s hardly impacting the show in any bad light at all. Sure it may get repetitive over time. But it&#039;s not to the point that it would be annoying. <br />
<br />
I&#039;d honestly say if you are interested in fitness, or just wanting to get into shape. Then give it a watch. It&#039;s not gonna be one of the best animes of course. But still a great watch. The characters are all honestly relatable. A nice anime.

    Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru is probably the most fun anime I’ve watched this season. Its got a colorful cast of characters who each add their own flair to the show and showcases some really solid comedy. It also provides some actually useful knowledge about the human body and working out. But you know what sets it apart from practically all other anime I’ve watched? <br />
<br />
It’s motivational<br />
<br />
To me, this is a pretty monumental feat. You’ll be hard pressed to find a show that actually inspires you to do what’s being shown. When I watch sports anime for example, I don’t immediately think to go and become

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317610">
        more athletic so I can look like the hot anime dudes playing the sports. Yet strangely enough, watching a ridiculously jacked almost nude dude giving me training lessons while girls drawn to look as seductive as possible are giving the demonstrations made me get up and train with them. And I did this with every single episode. Better yet, I actually started exercising regularly by using the exercises taught in the show. But I&#039;m not here to talk about me, so let&#039;s get into what I like about this anime!<br />
<br />
The story follows high schooler Sakura Hibiki as she goes on a quest to obtain the ultimate slim sexy body by working out. The girl must be a perfectionist, because she’s already got a super hot bod anyway, but that’s besides the point! The anime doesn’t explore much plot wise outside of the characters working out in different ways in different locations under different circumstances, but that’s absolutely fine for this kind of anime! The best part is that it just never gets boring. Each episode throws the characters into diverse environments ranging from mountain ranges to beaches and has them tackle differing obstacles in life…and in the weight room. As the anime progresses, more girls are added in, and the show just got better and better in terms of content with each girl added. Probably because of how quirky each girl ended up being.<br />
<br />
To give a brief break down on each of them, Hibiki is just adorable af and likes to eat, Akemi has awesome heart pupils and has a muscle fetish, Zina is an eccentric Russian otaku, Satomi is a cosplaying teacher, and Ayaka’s got some ABS! Character development? Pfft, who cares! All that matters is that they have great personalities, are all single and look great while working out. Of course, I can’t leave out everyone’s favorite muscle bro Machio, who is just so full of knowledge about muscles…and he’s just pretty full of muscles period. The dude also drops some fantastic one liners. <br />
<br />
This anime throws so much random stuff at you from time to time and it’s just brilliant. Just when I was going to take a break from exercising and watch an idol anime, BOOM! The girls audition as muscle idols. When I was beginning to question this anime being an ecchi, BOOM! The girls get their cloths obliterated Shokugeki style after witnessing Machio’s radiant muscles. And just when I was craving an image of a shirtless Comrade Putin posing with a bear in the icy Russian mountains, BOOM! The anime delivers. This show also has frickin&#039; ARNOLD SCHWARZEN- ah, I mean, BARNOLD SHORTSINATOR! And the references he makes are great, such as the famous “hasta la vista, baby” line from Terminator 2. Arnold, er, Barnold’s inclusion in this show is honestly one of the best references that I’ve seen in an anime. There’s also a multitude of fourth-wall breaking, which is always amusing. The comedy in this show is seriously quite good, and it’s been one of the very few anime in recent memory to actually make me laugh out loud while watching. <br />
<br />
And honestly, that’s usually enough to make me really appreciate a show. But that aside…sai?…Sai…SAIDO CHESTO!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
*Ahem* As I was saying, aside from the animated characters and sound comedy, Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru boasts some solid animation and sound. Visually, muscles are drawn with high precision. Machio just looks super macho! The girls are of course designed to be attractive, and I really like the coloring choices used by studio Doga Kobo, especially with the characters’ eyes. Sakura is the best example of their success in my opinion. She’s tan, blonde, has striking green eyes with a hint of pink, has twintails, has a fang, and has a super sexy bod that is slightly thicker than the other girls but still looks fantastic.<br />
<br />
Yeah, A+ character design right there. And while I may sound a little creepy and sad by expressing my attraction to a 2D anime girl, I’m the target audience and I like what I see, so that’s a success by the studio in my eyes!<br />
<br />
“HIP RAISE! SIDE BEND! BENT OVER! LAT PULL DOWN!” Wow, just listening to the opening made me discover so many different exercises. Even the damn theme song is educational! The song itself is super catchy and fun. Also, thanks to the motivational shouting of Sakura and Machio, the tune actually becomes a pretty good work out song that weirdly gets me pumped up. Of course, where the sound department truly shines is in the voice acting. The “Uuuuus!” and “Ahhhhhs!” that the girls moan out when they’re exercising in particular are quite nice to listen to. And while they all did an excellent job, the seiyuu that I was most impressed with would  be Ai Fairouz, who makes her voice acting debut as leading lady Sakura Hibiki. And boy, does she deliver! She just sounds so passionate in her role. It really feels like she’s having a fun time doing this, and her excellent delivery really heightened the enjoyment of the show for me. Pretty darn good for a newbie. Let’s hope she can make a successful career in the industry! <br />
<br />
I don’t like talking about myself in a review, but it’s true that since watching this anime, I’ve improved both physically and socially. Now Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru obviously isn’t the reason why I started going out with people. And it’s clearly not magically making me more fit. But it provided a spark. It motivated me to make some changes in my life. Sure, they were minuscule changes, but they were for the better nonetheless. And because of that, this show has done more for me personally than practically every anime that I’ve seen, including most of my absolute favorites. <br />
<br />
Of course that’s just me, and I can’t guarantee that you’ll get anything out of Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru. Regardless, this anime is just super entertaining to watch, and hey, if you end up working out and developing super awesome muscles because of it, then that’s a sweet added bonus! Thanks for reading and NICE BULK! <br />

    	Most people would agree that when it comes to judging a person&#039;s actions, the intent of the individual is what is most important. But is that really true? Even if the intent is poor, doesn&#039;t the result outweigh the intent? <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s say a company makes an anime, with the intent of earning money and entertaining an audience. After all, making a profit is the entire goal of any business, correct? However, the result is motivating people in a positive way. To try new things, look outside the box. To give them a small push that leads them to self-improvement. To donate an extra few milligrams

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317635">
        of dopamine to brighten someone&#039;s day. Wouldn&#039;t you agree that the result strongly outshines the intent? This is the result of watching Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru?.<br />
<br />
The power of cute girls doing cute things is a mysterious phenomenon. Whether it&#039;s the urge to pick up an instrument after watching K-ON!!. Or Yuru Camp△ and its enticing offer to delve into nature. These types of anime have a subtle charm that persuades you to explore new endeavors. <br />
<br />
While it can&#039;t be scientifically proven, I am certain that I&#039;m not alone in this experience. Can&#039;t find the motivation to get a gym membership and hit the weights? Watch this anime and you will understand what I&#039;m talking about.<br />
<br />
Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru is uncharted territory for the Slice of life/Comedy genre. (aka cute girls doing cute things) Just when you think every possible avenue has been excavated, we strike yet another gold mine. Similar to the Isekai genre, I am convinced that there are endless possibilities. My initial expectations of this anime were nothing short of pandering fanservice and cute girls working out in the gym. I am grateful that I was proven wrong.<br />
<br />
We all have that friend who is always complaining they want to shed some pounds (Kgs) but can&#039;t stop stuffing their face. Or something so primal and human as judging a book by its cover. We all create a mental persona of how a person is based on how they carry themselves. How they appear from the outside looking in. However, the reality in most cases never matches the picture you painted. This contrast is how I would describe the comedy in this anime, and it is a stroke of genius. They create scenarios that literally anyone can relate to and flip them on their head. I wouldn&#039;t consider it witty, or slapstick, It&#039;s just damn relatable.<br />
<br />
Like many things in life, there needs to be a balance. Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru&#039;s ability to transition between the hilariously relatable and more serious educational scenes is unmatched. This seamless tight rope walk is what makes the anime so enjoyable. It keeps the jokes always feeling fresh. Even the more repetitive gags (SIADO CHESTO!) are still hilarious until the final moments. <br />
<br />
Much like others in the genre, there is not much &quot;plot&quot; to be seen. However, where it lacks in plot it outdoes itself with cute, relatable characters and perfect punchlines. Not to mention outstanding music. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but I would say it&#039;s pretty hard to dispute the fact that the OP and ED are catchy as hell. <br />
<br />
Speaking of cute characters, our main duo Hibiki and Akemi are polar opposites. We have Akemi the disciplined, muscle obsessed, student council president. Who is contrasted by Hibike the gluttonous free spirit. They make for an unlikely duo, but the way they play off each other&#039;s differences creates countless amusing moments.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t worry there is more. We have the slim athletic boxer, a Russian foriener, and even a teacher who is a closet cosplayer. How can we possibly forget the personal trainer who has bicepts the size of my head, while somehow maintaing an adorable baby face.  With the cast posessing such a wide range of personalities there are countless angles for the anime&#039;s humor to flourish.<br />
<br />
This is an ecchi (perverted) anime so of course there is no shortage of eye candy. I&#039;m not here to judge your intent for watching this anime. I do advise you give it a chance though, even if it&#039;s not something you would normally watch. Hopefully your results are the same as mine. Becoming a more motivated and overall happier person.

    Put the chips down.  Place your sneakers on your feet.  Pull your shorts up…now pull them down again.  Now repeat that last motion…but slower.<br />
<br />
—WAIT!  These girls are only 17?…….F—K!!!<br />

Do you love promotional videos?  How about bench pressing?  What about lat pulldowns?<br />

Anyhow, “How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?” is an infomercial disguised as an anime — but wait, there’s more.  It features two ordinary girls — Hibiki (a slightly overweight Japanese girl) and Akemi (a girly who creams her pants every time she sees ‘Yuge!’ muscles) — as they visit the gym to strength train, build endurance,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313735">
        and rip their bathing suit as they stretch (that face, tho!).  The characters, thus far, are nothing special, and are often one-dimensional.  Hibiki is your typical indolent teenager with poor eating habits, and Akemi is your straight-laced, rich girl who lacks a personality.<br />
<br />
Besides the blatant supraliminal messaging, “Dumbbells” is a silly comedy with a distinct slapstick flare.  A few of the jokes are worthy of a chuckle, but nothing is potent enough to evoke giggling or a laugh-out-loud moment.  It’s not terrible, nor is it worthy of being called ‘good.’  <br />
<br />
“Dumbbells” is also considered Ecchi, but you wouldn’t have guessed it on first glance.  Most of the ‘lustful’ situations are tame by today’s standards.  Which is a good attribute when you consider the sheer volume of fan-service(y) anime in today’s market.  So if you have laundry to fold or homework that needs to be completed, then this is the perfect anime to play in the background to raise your MAL statistics.

    SAIDO CHESTOOOO!!!!<br />
<br />
In a season full of Isekai&#039;s, viking and more Isekai&#039;s, Doga Kobo gives its contribution with Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? I love Doga Kobo and their work, so I was hyped for this anime and Doga Kobo delivered. <br />
<br />
Hibiki is your ordinary high school girl who eats tons of food. She gets fat and wants to lose that fat. After failing to work out on her own she starts going to the gym. The rest of the anime we follow her trips to the gym. We get to know how she does the excercises, meet a colorful cast of characters and we get to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313796">
        see her improve her body as she series move on. It is a very simple story but an enjoyable one that isn&#039;t taxing on the brain.<br />
<br />
So one of the first things you notice about this anime is the overload of information they throw at you on how to excercise. This is because the anime is a form of edutainment. Edutainment is entertainment that you learn lots from. Anime that use this practice are for example Yuru Camp and Sounan Desu ka? Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru is an edutainment anime about excercising (more specifically excercising in gyms). So is the information useful?..... pretty much yes. I started to work out because of this anime, which I think says enough about if it works.<br />
<br />
The characters are really good. Hibiki is fun and relatable, Akemi&#039;s muscle fetish reminds me of Lalatina from Konosuba and I love it, Machio is absolutely hilarious by design alone and the rest of the cast are just as colorful and fun as the main characters.<br />
<br />
The animation is gorgeous. Doga Kobo went all out with the designs, sakuga, art style, it all so lovely to look at! The OP and ED are also really catchy.<br />
<br />
And last but not least, the anime is fun. The comedy gave me a few belly laughs. The character interactions are so lovely and fun. The edutainmen parts are incredibly useful and if they aren&#039;t useful, entertaining. <br />
<br />
Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? is a great anime. Doga Kobo&#039;s has made some quality anime for a year now. Uza Maid, Anima Yell, Watashi ni Tenshi, Senko-san, but despite them Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? rises above all of those anime. Watch this anime.

    Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru?<br />
<br />
Hip raise! Side bend!<br />
(Fukkin roku LDK kai!)<br />
<br />
<br />
Push up! Bench press!<br />
(Daikyoukin ga aruiteru!)<br />
<br />
That was some very unique anime, quite frankly I&#039;m just not amuse by such thing.<br />
<br />
So:<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
Pros: It was informative, but then......................<br />
<br />
<br />
Cons: Not all of it were of any use, in fact some of the fitness tips being shown doesn&#039;t have any basis in some area of activity, like that of working out the back leg muscles to gain speed and stamina when competing in track and field. Also, there were some info that as usual was typically not discussed like when it come to dieting, and when the one who was giving

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317868">
        the tip was a typical stereotype of a bodybuilder like Machio, whose body was the kind where real life bodybuilder inject themselves with steroids.<br />
<br />
Verdict 3/10<br />
<br />
Art<br />
<br />
Pros: A lotta eyecandies, there were some swimsuit services.<br />
<br />
Cons: Most of the ecchi featured here was all about Machio and his steroid infused body, where his head looks like it was transplanted into a bodybuilders bod, and quite frankly him having to be in his posing briefs for most of the time, were just too annoying.<br />
<br />
Verdict 3/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
Pros: Good opening and ending theme.<br />
<br />
Cons: Nothing to mentioned.<br />
<br />
Verdict 8/10<br />
<br />
Character<br />
<br />
Pros: Nothing in particular.<br />
<br />
Cons: The characters here only serves one thin and one thing only and that was to play as host and models, in fact their character roles here were simply just forced comedy the weren&#039;t funny at all. To put in in simple terms, the characters roles can be compared to that of any morning exercise show that you can watch on TV. As for Machio&#039;s role, well, he basically was nothing more than to add insult to injury to all couch potato otakus out there, in fact a fitness event showing beautiful fit ladies would be much more of a effective motivator to get a couch potato in to shape, than to use someone in likes of Machio. <br />
<br />
Verdict 2/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
<br />
Pros: Well, it was enjoying to watch them eyecandies, being in their workout attire, but..........................<br />
<br />
<br />
Cons: Just watching this, one would be more focus on them girls than anything else, in fact when I watch this , I just skip out the workout tips that were in Machio&#039;s segment and just go with the girls&#039; goal of being fit. Now to me I see no need to take in the fitness tips the were featured here cu&#039;z I&#039;m already engage in to it where, I run and participate in various marathon events, and trust me going to a gym is basically some thing that we do seldom, since we runner need to work out our endurance that to build muscle. <br />
<br />
Verdict 3/10<br />

Realistically this anime was a far-cry as to the business of fitness in Japan, you see, only less than a few people there do go to gyms like Golds Gym, where membership is expensive.....Thought there were a lot of private gyms in Japan, most of them were not up to any standards that one would see in other countries, not to mentioned that even if Japs do have the time to go to get in shape, most would go to public gyms where prices were affordable , but still not up to US or European standards, but decent enough to get in shape. Also, neither this anime nor its manga version have any place in the otaku, it basically just doesn&#039;t belong around here, so basically studio Doga Kobo and the original creator, MAAM just made a stupid move of making this kind of shit, cu&#039;z what they&#039;re doing was selling a Sweater to a Bedouin cu&#039;z Japanese in general already have a healthy lifestyle and most really don&#039;t have any time to do such activity.         <br />

    Starting this anime, I kind of expected to end up dropping this after a couple episodes. Comedy and ecchi aren&#039;t typically my cup of tea, but much to my surprise, this anime was an exception.<br />
<br />
Besides all the fan service one can expect from ecchi (which to me the fan service hasn&#039;t been super in your face or over pushed), this anime is actually very motivational and informative. I think anyone who wants to start a healthier lifestyle or needs the motivation to hit the gym could benefit from this anime. Basically this anime shows you the proper techniques to work out at the gym and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316279">
        home while keeping you interested following the story of high school girls trying to improve their bodies. At the end of every episode, they even walk you through a workout you can easily do at home. <br />
<br />
Overall I gave this anime a 10 because not only have I personally enjoyed it, but the concept of teaching a skill that all of us can only benefit from really pleasantly surprised me. I actually came out of this anime learning things I didn&#039;t know about nutrition and working out that I will definitely apply to my own life and future workouts. I recommend this anime to literally anyone who needs some motivation to begin a healthier lifestyle. Nice bulk!

    Girl do you even lift!? <br />
<br />
How Heavy Are The Dumbells You Lift or my preferred name up above is the recent edition to a new sub genre of anime that I like to call cute girls doing cool and educational things. This year we’ve had girls singing beautiful songs and girls surviving on a deserted island. This time we have girls working out and getting in shape for our viewing pleasure, and what a pleasure it is. <br />
<br />
The concept for this anime/manga is genius. How do we get people to start taking care of themselves? How do we get people to hit the gym? The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317617">
        answer is simple, get some cute anime girls to hit the gym in your place thus inspiring you to do the same. I mean what could be a better motivator then you and your waifu working out side by side. <br />
<br />
The anime even has a good starting off point for those who are hesitant to the idea of “physical activity”. The show starts off with the main character Hibiki wanting to get in shape for the summer. The kind of goal that just about anyone post New Year’s Eve can relate to. The only difference is Hibiki follows through with her plan by joining Silverman’s Gym which is definitely not based off anything. From there she is introduced to her gym friend and muscle freak “ “ along with the gyms trainer Machio San which if the name is any indication is a completely normal average guy who just happens to have a rare form of gigantism where every part of his body except his head is supersized. Normally that kind of disproportionate body size thing would irk me but this is a comedy, so it just works. The dude is also allergic to clothes if you know what I mean. <br />
<br />
There isn’t really much of a story aside from every day presents a new workout for the girls to try. There are a few short story arcs with some surprising cameos but most of the time is devoted to flexing and posing. Yes, that’s right. This show is one big Jojo reference. The cats out of the bag. It was just a JoJo anime all along. <br />
<br />
Getting back on track, I like that the show is actually taking the time to educate me on the different workout techniques that are displayed. Now I know there are going to be some people that say the fanservice distracts from the learning opportunities but in all honesty, for once the fan service is both needed and justified. It’s needed because an anime just about people working out with no fan service is not going to motivate anyone to check out the show let alone attempt any of the workouts. Finally it’s justified because the act of working out is all about improving the body. Making the body look good. It’s a necessary evil. <br />
<br />
When it comes to getting in a good work out, the right music play list is needed to get you in the mood to train hard. Luckily this anime provides both a good opening song and ending song to listen to the next time you feel like pumping iron. Art and animation is pretty good especially the when it comes to accentuating the finer details of the human body for educational purposes of course. Seriously though, lots of eye candy in this show and you have the art/animation to thank for that. <br />
<br />
Overall, this is my kind of show. It’s the perfect blend of entertainment and education. Call it edutainment. Might even have to give it the rewatch just so I can workout to it and follow along with the characters. I can confidently give “Girl Do You Even Lift!?” my full recommendation.

    &quot;Come boys and girls, it&#039;s time to whip up those muscles and burn your body fat to whips!&quot;<br />
<br />
For Doga Kobo, consistency is everything they&#039;ve shown us since the beginning of the year with Winter&#039;s sisterly love rom-com Wataten!, Spring&#039;s nyanpasu of the (not so cunning) foxly iyashikei that is Senko-san, and now for the hottest Summer, doing something out of the ballpark, which are dumbbells and exercises! And holy smokes is it ever as satisfying as motivation to go to the gym and workout for the better! Nah, just kidding, but seriously we should all at least attempt to keep fit,<br />
<br />
This was one of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317612">
        most hyped shows that is recommended at best by people who are gyming and can attest to the routines of the manga, that it replicated the true workout experience when it decided to go full-on ecchi-ational about it, and now watching the anime, it now makes me wanna go straight to the gym to do those workouts and know the rights and wrongs and such shtick to get the fittest body I could ever have, and no, I’m still far from a six-pack body figure like Silverman Gym trainer Machio Naruzo.<br />
<br />
YES...SAIDO CHESTOOO!!!!!<br />
<br />
It’s funny how we start off with unknown said MC girl, Sakura Hibiki, being the average layman of a high school JK. I&#039;m afraid (but no fat shame!) to admit that there’s a Hibiki in all of us, as we loveeee eating food, and some have a very high rate of appetite, but when it comes to cutting down those calories, we find it hard, and too is the same situation that Hibiki is facing. Onward to gym then, and meeting another girl, student council Prez Akemi Souryuuin, who is working out at Silverman Gym, and has muscle fetish, since most guys there in gym are macho men and do nothing but workout, eat healthily and drink protein powder. How fabulous. As you know in gym, there’s always far less women than men in the gym, and Akemi makes an attempt to entice Hibiki to sign up to not make her feel so embarrassed about being the only girl there. Let the conquest to great body and health begin!<br />
<br />
As we progress throughout the strenuous journey of keeping fit within various exercises and routines,  Silverman Gym trainer Machio Naruzo, voiced by Tate no Yuusha’s Naofumi (a.k.a. Kaito Ishigawa), seemingly took a break on fighting monsters to encouraging people to get fit and keep at it, which isn’t a bad thing! His famous pose is the side chest, which is the hallmark for every “Machio” men. And even more people join in the fun too, like Hibiki’s friend Ayaka Uehara, whose family runs a professional boxing business, and is already at her six-pack game, so this is nothing but keeping consistent with her exercising practices. Not to mention that their own homeroom teacher Satomi Tachibana-sensei is enticed with the fact that exercising not only gets you fitter, but earns your chances at a boyfriend (a.k.a her crush being Machio). Plus, even rivals from the similar branches overseas, we seek to Russian Gina Boyd, whose arm wrestling skills are unmatched, that is until Hibiki steals her thunder (and muscles) and transfers over to Japan to compete more with her, and that her knowledge is as plain as an otaku. This world suddenly is coming together in a weird comedy ecchi fantasy feeling…<br />
<br />
If there’s one thing to praise about this series, more often than not is in its execution in both skill and expertise, as if it’s aware that it should be teaching the right way to go around doing exercises we could’ve been doing about all right or wrong, as an improvement or distinguishing what is correct and incorrect, advisory sold together with it. And I’m glad that if the exercises here helped you, keep on doing and benefiting from this! As much as it is a full-on comedy ecchi show, it doesn’t overplay a lot of its ecchiness, or rather being fully concrete than going around half-assing it (like many other anime). The comedy here is, shall I say, finer than gold, with the incredulous amount of parodies (e.g. Machio’s trainer being Arnold Schwarzenegger) and insane situations that make your mind go bonkers at how much it works to a T.<br />
<br />
Being Doga Kobo, as I’ve stated in the beginning, consistency is key, and they managed it completely fine after 3 long seasons of different source materials. Like seriously, you guys over at the studio should catch a break (and go gyming, that’s the best you can do!). Plentiful art and animation with the heavy-hitters being MUSCLE FLEX, that is a thing. Never knew showing off your muscles can be such a pain in the ass, but holy shit is that super satisfying. This anime’d teach me to treasure my strength that’s measured in muscles.<br />
<br />
OST was great, honest to God. Both the OP and ED were muscle strenuous and visually appealing, ESPECIALLY the ED if you could translate the song and know it’s origins because that song is a guideline from the Master Trainer Machio himself! Simply great, and never a skip. Plus the amount of background music that focuses on the power of the muscles and whatnot, you’d have yourself a great time watching this.<br />
<br />
Now I would like to reconsider re-watching this for the post-credits: the workout of the week, that’s always a nice touch for lazy people like us whom have barely only 5 to 10 mins of free estate time to AT LEAST exercise.<br />
<br />
Remember y’all, an apple a day keeps the doctor away, but exercising everyday brings you one step closer to greatness in bulk!<br />
<br />
And as always, NICE BULK!

    There are so many distinct cute girls doing cute things anime, which are all fun and colourful, and gives you that wholesome and fluff you are looking for. Now we finally have yet another anime to add that ever-growing collection CGDCT list. It&#039;s an anime you didn&#039;t know how much you needed before you actually watched it first hand. Basically, Dumbbell is cute girls working out. So first off, we are introduced to our adorable fang gyrau Sakura Hibiki. Who seems to think she is getting a little cubby down the tummy area and decides to hit the gym. But if you ask me, she

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325079">
        looks adorable and as ever and don&#039;t need to change one bit in any single way. Hibiki meets all kind of other charming and quirky girls in the gym. Among others, we have a lovely russian with an action-packed personality who loves real competition. A tan boxer girl with a striking personality as well as body undoubtedly. Not to mention, even a soft-spoken teacher who is a real otaku cosplayer on her days off. Lastly, a girl with a mad fetish for the muscles to top it all off. <br />
<br />
In other words, its non-stop fun with all these lovely girls who&#039;s persona bounces off well with the others. Then there&#039;s  Machio who is the personal trainer for these girls and the one who teaches them everything. As the girls are learning about how the equipment works, or how you do push-ups or sit-ups as you are meant to. Alongside, we have a small segment where the girls show us their good stuff to the audience and leave us captivated and immersed. All for the right reasons, of course. Basically, we got eyeful of candy which blesses your eyes and soul. As you might&#039;ve suspected, Dumbbell uses this chance to show us some spicy fanservice, thighs, melons or buttocks, you name it. Not to mention, it&#039;s done as the girls are performing a training act, so the juiciness and flavour are incredible. Not but for real, you are learning in the best way possible. It&#039;s so educational in more ways than one, and it adds to the charm of Dumbbell. <br />
<br />
Some who might not be motivated to training or staying healthy might have a sudden change of heart, after or while watching this anime. We even get the details like how much calories and fat you can burn, or things you might not even have known prior. Whatever the case, there is definitely something for anyone in Dumbbell to enjoy. The comedy is also golden and hits the at the right time, and makes you laugh non-stop. It&#039;s rightfully timed, and the play with art-style makes it all come together, and really cause an impact. Studio Doga Koba is creative in the way how they utilize and twist and turn the art-style as they see fit. While we are on the topic now, yes, artistically it looks great and makes some anime give it run for its money. It&#039;s so pleasing and vibrant, the colours are popping and just looks great. There was not a single time for me personally, where I thought it looked off or noticed any form of derp. Same goes for animation, it&#039;s so fluid and complements the art-style for sure.<br />
<br />
 In any case, the production value is solid, and studio Doga Kobo nailed their use throughout this fun and educational journey. But when have they ever failed us? Doga Kobo is still standing strong as the epitome of nailing all art-style when it comes to the works involving cute girls doing cute things. You can see their love and passion in the frames clearly, and just how much fun they had animating Dumbbell. I can&#039;t wait to see their next works at all. I am sure it will be another worthwhile and vibrant experience I will really enjoy. Now let&#039;s not forget about that. Oh, so catchy opening song which is to this day still stuck in my head. I can the whole song, but I bet I will blow some eardrums if I sang it with my crackpot Japanese. So I will not do that. It&#039;s so fun and did I forget to mention an educational song? That&#039;s right, you can learn something from the opening song, as you are bopping your head left and right to the catchy tune. The ending song is merely great too, and another catchy tune to add the collection.<br />
<br />
 In the sound department overall tho, it&#039;s got a decent amount of tracks which fit the situation at any given time. There is this sinister last boss theme, or a piece of more upbeat training music to mention some. So if I haven&#039;t stated it any clearer, than I do in fact highly recommend Dumbbell. Not only if you are CGDCT enthusiast, more or less anyone might enjoy this anime. I can almost guarantee that you&#039;ll get a good laugh. As you are learning interesting things about working out while enjoying some savoury fanservice to boot. Now Dumbbell is not a character or especially story-driven anime, it&#039;s only meant for entertainment. But boy does it use the aspect of working out in some creative ways, which just never gets old. Since they always throw something new at you, in some shape or form. All in all, Dumbbell was a solid watch for me, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. I am definitely gonna pick up the manga at one point.

Ok, so another Josei theme anime has just ended, but unlike the usual josei genre anime which was always set in a school setting, this one was set in a gym where it involves a quartet of girls whom decide to become gym members in some gym called &quot;Silvermans&quot; which btw was a parody of &quot;Golds Gym&quot; in Japan which btw has 38 branches in Japan. So, lets get down to business:<br />
<br />
Story-Very Good 8:<br />
<br />
Because it was informative, thought the plot was more on the fitness and working out

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317752">
        side, now , I don&#039;t about you guys out there when it come to your level of gym and workout IQ, but one thing I can tell you was that the information about the kinds of workout routine was just based on the original creator&#039;s knowledge about the kinds of workout programs that he or she has......but, that is of course if this Original Creator who calls him or herself &quot;MAAM&quot; is also a fitness buff him or herself. But then again, in reality each fitness trainer has his or her program, so what this certain &quot;MAAM&quot; has was probably his or her program. Cu&#039;z for one thing, not every info in this anime or manga were correct, in fact  some of the workouts being featured around here were simply too far fetch or were just made out, one example was working out the calf muscle in order to incense stamina and speed in running was just all wrong, and just relying on protein alone just to have the kind of body that Machio has was also an understatement, cu&#039;z   realistically speaking bodybuilders pump themselves up with a lotta supplements and steroids. Now what make me rate this an 8 cu&#039;z it was probably the only info anime that doesn&#039;t require a plot, cu&#039;z basically that wasn&#039;t the original creator&#039;s plan , his or her intention was to promote fitness and that&#039;s that. <br />
<br />
Art-Pathetic 1:<br />
<br />
Ok, so this anime does have an ecchi genre, but most of it was more like an ecchi for gays and girls with a muscle fetish and yes I&#039;m referring to Machio Naruzou&#039;s illustration, were he was illustrated as a stereotypical gym rat, that  otaku&#039;s and geeks would really love to hate. Also, his head was ridiculously a mismatch for his head were it can also be a metaphor that he&#039;s all brawn but no brains  <br />
<br />
Sound- Very Good :<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s for the opening theme, also, it was a good move for studio Doga Kobo to cast Yui Horie to voice a matured character like Tachibana Satome the girls teacher, since Yui is already in her mid 30&#039;s and that for her to voice a younger character who happens to be a joshkausei would be pathetic.<br />
<br />
Character- Dreadful 2:<br />
<br />
Ok, so we have Hibiki whom at first want&#039;s to lose weight but ends up being a fitness freak, we have  Souryuuin, Akemi who was the quintessential rich girl with a muscle fetish, we have Uehara, Ayaka, whom at first unknown to Hibiki was already a fitness buff and we have Gina Boyd a Russian expat who simply went to Japan to compete in arm wrestling but decide to stay after being beaten by Hibiki and let&#039;s not forget the Tachibana Satomi who also at first wants to lose weight and just like Hibiki she to becomes a fitness freak, now just there girls would have been fine , but what&#039;s annoying was Machio Naruzou, who always flaunts his huge muscle in fact there wasn&#039;t an episode where you won&#039;t see him ripping his track suit in order to show off the results of his so called hard work   Basically, he&#039;s a metaphor for a school jock that bullies the weak. Also, his stereotype basically give a wrong impression were he symbolizes a healthy person who practices a healthy lifestyle , but realistically Bodybuilders weren&#039;t exactly healthy and their lifestyle were far from healthy, also girls in reality weren&#039;t very much a fan of guys with huge muscles and there were studies and surveys that shows it, in fact girls were more attracted to ripped guys with six packs and I&#039;m referring to the abs, So generally speaking the ecchi part here was more like gay ecchi where Machio would serve as every gay&#039;s sexual fantasy. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment -Poor 3:<br />
<br />
Basically, I just see this as more like a chore than something to be enjoyed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall-Poor 3.<br />
<br />
Thought this maybe informative and helpful, IMAO, this anime was just like selling a cooler to an Eskimo, cu&#039;z in reality, Gyms in Japans like that of Golds Gym were really expensive and also gyms in Japan tend to have a lotta wired house rules and were under equip and let&#039;s not forget that most Japanese in general don&#039;t have anytime for such extra curricular activity and they don&#039;t have to, cu&#039;z they already were practicing a healthy lifestyle so for them to even give such anime/manga like this any attention was just a waste of time, in fact only those in the 0.05 percent would have the time to engage in such activity. Even if Japanese would have the time to get themselves in such activity, they would go a public gym where prices would be affordable. So Overall, this anime/manga was just a PWT where otakus would rather go bananas with them eye-candies like Hibiki, Gina , Akemi and Ayaka, than to take their tips seriously......Machio on that other hand basically was someone whom them Otakus would love to hate, so basically this anime or it&#039;s manga really have no place around here.<br />
<br />
The end.<br />
<br />
<br />

    &quot;Do you wanna go get swole man? Do you wanna make some gains?&quot; <br />
<br />
As someone who&#039;s been going to the gym consistently for a couple of years now, I was hyped about this anime ever since I heard that it was being made. However, even though the concept is brilliant, the execution however, is somwhat dissapointing. This review is mostly going to be from my perspective as a gym bro, so bear with me.<br />
<br />
It was oblivious from the first episode that this is an anime writen by someone who has never been to the gym and got most of the advice on it from people

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317613">
        who don&#039;t really know what their talking about, your generic personal trainers that can be found in most gyms. The advice was sometimes good, but most of the times it was the same bro-science people have been repeting for decades without actually looking at research. The form on exercices is also mostly wrong, it would litteraly take 5 minutes to go on youtube and write &quot;How to bench&quot; or &quot;How to squat&quot; and see how its actually done and show it that way in an anime. Having said all that, the redeming fact about the show is that it will definitly inspire more people to start living healtier lives and strength train.<br />
<br />
Anime wise, it was pretty average, but also very fun at moments. The animation was pretty good, however could have been better on some of the exercises, the characters were pretty one-dimensional and had one or two character traits that kept being repeated. Really wanted them to show a lot more exercises in the gym, maybe throw in a few more cultural references, overall spend more time in the gym insead of doing other random things. As I said earlier, the idea is great, and had it been executed better, for example making it a sports/comedy anime about powerlifting or some simular sport. Sound wise, the opening and ending are very catchy and great songs.<br />
<br />
Overall, I give this a 6/10, as it did have its moments that I enjoyed, but it could have been so much better. Also, daily reminder to do SS.

    Picture this: the date is July 4, 2019. One day after “Dumbell Nan Kilo Moteru?” is released. You work at a fairly inconspicuous gym, it’s a slow day and all you can think of is going back home to throw back a cold one and pass out. Suddenly, you hear a loud rumbling sound from outside the gym’s front door. You start to panic, New years is still half a year away and you were planning on quitting before the horde consumed you. As the rumblings get louder you hear a faint: “Nice Muscle!” in the distance and you realize what is happening. It’s too

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317615">
        late. As hundreds of weebs fill the gym trampling you underfoot like Mufasa in The Lion King the last thought that goes through your head is “So this is the power of anime… not bad, not bad at all”.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tl;dr I’m going to be 100% real with you guys, back in the year 2017 I started reading this manga because I thought it was going to another generic ecchi anime just with all females. Don’t get me wrong, this show is about 75% ecchi nonsense but underneath all of it, you actually get a pretty comprehensible workout instructional video. The art is really good and while the story is pretty lackluster, does it really need a Shakespearean masterpiece? It’s relatively funny but all in all, it’s definitely not for everyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story 5: Comprehensible, reasonable, funny at times, but above all else mediocre.<br />
<br />
Just to rehash what I said earlier, this show doesn’t NEED to be really complex to be enjoyable. There really isn’t much to say about the story besides the fact that the humor SOMETIMES lands, at least I found it pretty funny, but you can definitely see pretty much all the jokes coming. <br />
<br />
Art 8: The trojan horse that got millions of weebs into working out<br />
<br />
You can make pretty much any weeb do whatever you want by animating a cute anime girl to do it first and this is definitely the case with Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru. I really wish I had statistical evidence to back me up but I’m more than certain that this show has influenced MORE than a few people to get up and start doing a few pushups. And this can be credited to just fantastic art by Doga Kobo. That being said, I gave the art an 8 because the animation just isn&#039;t there. It&#039;s serviceable, especially during the workout sections but overall there really isn’t too much to write home about<br />
<br />
Sound 10: SIDE CHESTO<br />
<br />
This is pretty self-explanatory, the opening and ending are basically perfect and hypes everyone within a three-mile radius to jump off their couch and start doing sit-ups or flex in the mirror. Anything that hypes me up this much gets a 10 in my opinion <br />
<br />
Character 7: I can’t think of any jokes to be honest <br />
<br />
To be honest I feel like almost everyone in this show can be explained with only one sentence (example: Hibiki likes to eat a lot. And Naruzou is really buff). There really isn’t anything I can say besides that, they aren’t bad and they fit the story perfectly but there really two dimensional. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10: Even with some of the shortcomings I talked about earlier, this show is still an absolute banger and will forever be known as the one show that finally pushed me to try working out for once. Even when I wasn’t pumping iron or running a 20-mile marathon (at least that what it felt like) it still kept my attention from start to finish which is all I can really ask for at this point.<br />
<br />
Overall 8: It’s a really good show and even if you’re not interested in sports at all I’d still recommend at least trying the show out for a little bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    This show is fun. At first i thought it will probably be the next fanservice anime, which it is, but it actually gives good information. As someone who works out i&#039;m impressed how well they explain things.<br />
<br />
I usually don&#039;t like fanservice when it distracts too much form the story or the camera is awkwardly placed to allow an upskirt but oddly, since this anime has not much of a story, it is not bothersome. And anybody who works out knows how much fanservice there is in a fitness center. Some of it is actually pretty accurate.<br />
<br />
You can to an extent identify with the mc. Who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315588">
        doesn&#039;t try to cheat or sets up cheat days? Who isn&#039;t tempted to buy and eat something unhealthy when being out with firends? Or who isn&#039;t exhausted always looking atthe back of groceries to see how much sugar, fat and protein they have. It depicts those difficulties especially when starting beautifully.<br />
<br />
Still, the moaning and the angle can get too awkward at times so there is that, know this if you dislike fanservice more than i do.<br />
<br />
All in all a fine series.

    Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? is a gReAt anime that goes in depth about body building except it is more body than the building. You want it dem thighs? You got it the thighs! You want dem bOObies? You got it dem tiddies! You want it dem ass? You got dem juicy peaches! You want it dem abs? They got you, baby!<br />
 <br />
Story:<br />
The story goes through the daily life of Sakura, who is a food addict but also wants to cut down weight. However, she has a hidden monstrous strength within her and she now aims to be the greatest hokage in the world!<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Characters were very

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318287">
        well written but at the same time, they are also well DEVELOPED. The commercial break poses from the characters is plus-ultra worthy. You know what they say, never listen to your brain, only listen to your pp. The only real complain I have is that idiot Machio chose to name his gym Silverman gym, when it should have been Goldenman gym. Silverman sounds like second place, and it also means he will be sleeping outside the house tonight. <br />
<br />
Music:<br />
The compositions in this anime is very intellectual. The multiple, complex melody lines make baroque composers like Bach and Handel applaud from the heavens. The opening song was funky and full of life, and it speaks to the soul. When the girls swing their hips from side to side, their motion urges even the most stubborn of humans to the same. Just ask Simon Chowell.<br />
<br />
He loved every second of it.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art is like seeing the Niagara Falls for the first time, absolutely breathtaking. Watching Machio flex during the lingerie competition was like meeting jesus, it was enlightening and life changing. I remember taking a knee, along with all the anime characters, out of respect for such an exquisite pose while my plebian friend stared at me like I was weeb scum, but rest assured, he was exiled from the grave and we are no longer friends. There was an amazing fight scene, where Sakura activated super Saiyan 3 and fired the Kamehameha to beat Gina, her long-time arch rival from the Philippines in a sumo wrestling competition. Oh shit, spoiler warning.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Watching Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? animated is like reaching the 6th stage of grief, far greater and further beyond what the 5th stage, acceptance, has to offer. It has the power to cure depression, to cure cancer, it has the power to protect the people from oh-so-threatening fire nation. I would highly recommend everyone to give this anime a go, and if it makes your pp hard, it is but to be expected of an anime that surpasses even the universe itself.  <br />
<br />
Everybody is entitled to their own opinion, except yours is always wrong – Mahatma Ghandi, 2030<br />

    Really, I came across this when I was looking for proper <br />
anime.<br />
<br />
I started playing sports <br />
<br />
<br />
It became difficult to find the kind of anime I wanted in the completed anime.I looked at the newly released animes and came across it.<br />
<br />
Story |9| : I don&#039;t need to explain<br />
Art |10|:The drawings are very good and reflect the anime<br />
Sound|9|:I can&#039;t say I&#039;m interested in voices.<br />
Character |10|:The character designs are very good.I haven&#039;t seen such good design in a long time.Also the characters are anime-appropriate and fun.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment|10|:Do I still need to mention it ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Definitely watch.You can watch Anime now if you can&#039;t find it it definitely saves you

    Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? is not only an enjoyable series but also gives insight into fitness for those who are new or oblivious. I came into this series with low expectations, but was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. This show has short little excerpts that explain how to do several exercises, these are presented in a fun and comedic way but also explain the exercises well and are a good place for viewers to gain a little knowledge about fitness and weight lifting. <br />
<br />
This show does fall short with it&#039;s underdeveloped characters. Though this is okay due to the show mostly being

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314729">
        comedic, so it&#039;s more about the situations the characters end up in.
