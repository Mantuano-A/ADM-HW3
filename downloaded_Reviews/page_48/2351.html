    Sousei no Onmyouji was really high in the expectations in my book, especially since the author of Naruto himself recommended reading the manga. Well, I guess Naruto fans might enjoy it, but I sure as heck DIDN&#039;T.<br />

STORY: 1/10<br />
<br />
Behold, the insanely unique story about heroes beating monsters! Yeah. That&#039;s it. Oh, I guess there&#039;s a parallel world too, because that makes it an absolute must watch!<br />

<br />
In all seriousness, the plot of Sousei no Onmyouji is completely ripped through and through, and I honestly have nothing good to say about it, so I&#039;ll make this short: If you have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review218459">
        watched ANY SHONEN EVER, I don&#039;t recommend watching this, as the shonen you saw was probably far superior.<br />
__________________________________________________________________________<br />
ART: 5/10<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve actually seen quite a bit of people compliment the series for it&#039;s flashy art style, which surprises me. Until I visited a couple online forums, I had thought nothing but &#039;below average&#039; while watching the show. The animation, I would still say, is below average, the action looking rather bland (and, lets be honest, who cares about what else animation does in a shonen), but I will admit to the art style being better than I had initially thought. The bright colors are rather nice, and it definitely makes the scenes more distinguishable from other series.<br />
__________________________________________________________________________<br />
SOUND: 5/10<br />
<br />
The sound is mediocre through and through. Everything is generic, even the opening with it&#039;s nice sound, has lost it&#039;s affect on me already, and I&#039;m realizing just how little I care about things like the voice acting, sound effects, and soundtrack of the show. There isn&#039;t much to compliment, but hey, it could be worse!<br />
__________________________________________________________________________<br />
CHARACTER: 1/10<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t contain myself watching those two...... You have your typical overpowered main character, and the kuudere lead that makes him blush all the time. The characters have absolutely no depth, and the supporting characters aren&#039;t really given enough reason to be cared about, even though they have more potential then our lead characters ever did.....<br />
__________________________________________________________________________<br />
OVERALL: 3/10<br />
<br />
Honestly, unless you&#039;re the guy who never gets bored with cliches, I can&#039;t recommend this show to you. Sousei no Onmyouji was a pathetic choice for a recommendation Mashimata, though he did recommend the manga, so I won&#039;t rant on him to much. Well, at the very least, the anime is not worth your time.

    I feel that these 8.5 words describe the entirety of this anime: <br />
“Cliche Archetype-filled Exorcist Shounen With Many Crappy Plot Twists”<br />
<br />
I have very mixed feelings about this show…<br />
- Sometimes I thought, “Oh, this is such a cool kiddy shounen!”<br />
- Sometimes I became angry at how stupid and immature the characters were.<br />
- I often skipped through some of the many slow scenes and flashbacks.<br />
- Sometimes I even said, “Whoa! Didn’t see that coming! Is this really a kids show? wtf?” when some pretty dark things happened<br />
- However, most importantly, by the end I thought to myself “Wow, this is pretty fucking bad.”<br />
<br />
I honestly thought this show

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243889">
        was going to be pretty average at first (5 out of 10). Then I thought, “Oh wow! This is actually pretty good!” from 9 to 37-ish (7/10). However, towards the end the show started pulling both random and shitty plot twists out of its ass, and then shooting them at us like it’s a “shit machine-gun” (2/10)...<br />
<br />
TL;DR at the end<br />
<br />
Story:(4/10) <br />
The story mainly follows two cliche and initially overpowered main protagonists named “Rokuro” and “Benio” as they overcome many hard trials thereby growing stronger and closer together displaying mild romance. They’re prophesized to be the “twin stars” or two chosen exorcists that will get married, have a baby, and the baby will be the most powerful exorcist called the “miko” (basically something like a baby Jesus that will save the world from all of the evil kegare monsters). The evil kegare monsters are sealed in an alternate dimension called “megano”, where the exorcists must go to fight them. Almost all of the characters are slowly introduced with background stories that are supposed to be tragic, but their backgrounds came across as overly done to the point where it was kind of just stupid-silly after a while. The story emphasizes that Rokuro and Benio both want to get stronger... and they do... At a snail’s rate anyways, but no worries because they often get sudden power ups out of nowhere. Mm~ sudden power ups. My favorite… (sarcasm)<br />
<br />
The story really doesn’t have any depth, and it certainly isn’t realistic. For example, one of the main antagonists is basically just some psychotic kid with attachment issues. One thing that really pissed me off is that all of the villains kept saying phrases like:<br />
<br />
&quot;I am all powerful! and you are weak!&quot; <br />
“It is no use for you to try to win!”<br />
“Oh, but it was all part of my master plan!” <br />
“THIS TOO IS PART OF MY MASTER PLAN!” <br />
and then the shitty plot twist that I mentioned earlier would be another antagonist saying, <br />
“But your master plan was part of my SUPER master plan ALL ALONG! I have been using you, lesser antagonist, this whole time!” <br />
I often just sat in my chair, apathetic to all of the bullshit that the characters kept pulling out of their asses.<br />
<br />
I feel the story’s pace was much too slow, often dwelling much too long on the characterization and development of the twin stars. It wasn’t really exciting, so I didn’t feel like waiting to watch each new episode once a week. I actually ended up binge-watching once every four months. It had its ups and downs. It’s a pretty a pretty bad story overall. Towards the end, we randomly got hit with some pedophile plot twist shit, and I honestly don’t know what the hell to make of this anime anymore. It had its moments, but the story was actually pretty bad overall. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art:(5/10)<br />
The art in the fight scenes sometimes looks like it’s from a game where they pause and call out the name of their attack with an epic pose before actually doing it. Everything freezes when this happens, so it adds a certain &quot;style&quot; to the art.<br />
<br />
The art&#039;s okay overall, but I feel that the series would be more appealing if the characters weren&#039;t so... bright and cute...? Except there&#039;s one thing that gets to me every time... It&#039;s Rokuro... There are scenes when his art turns into something out of a horror movie.  The animation is not the best with many still-frames and lack of dramatic camera angles. The art&#039;s fine overall.<br />
<br />
Sound:(8/10) <br />
What can I say? They did a pretty good job on the sound. The OST is mainly dubstep, which threw me off at first, but I kind of like it now. The fighting works well, background music fits completely and enhances the setting. Openings and endings are also very fitting. It&#039;s actually relatively unique, but it&#039;s not special or powerful like something like something Yuki Kajiura or Sawano Hiroyuki would make. Only one OST was memorable for me until episode 27&#039;s opening theme. But now that I finished the anime, I actually occasionally catch myself thinking about their OSTs! (I guess 50 episodes of an anime will do that to you).<br />
<br />
Characters: (4/10)<br />
The characters were okay, at best. However, towards the end, they ended up having little to no real depth at all. In general, they’re  pretty much just average characters with nothing much special about them except for Rokuro&#039;s shark teeth (main male character). I initially hated both Rokuro and Benio, but, I actually started liking the main characters around episode 14/15 after they unnecessarily spent all of that time developing the twin stars. However, they&#039;re basically just kids with sad background stories tasked with saving the world from Kegare. Honestly, they probably could have made this series into about 24 episodes if they skipped the unnecessary development episodes. <br />
<br />
There are a lot of side characters with the potential to be interesting, but they all got little to no development. The dynamic between Benio and Rokuro is pretty nice to watch, but there&#039;s nothing too special here. Rokuro&#039;s starts off as kind of annoying, fiery, not that smart, and overpowered, but the enemies do get much stronger and Rokuro matures quite a bit and actually becomes a pretty cool character. Benio is the typical smart, cool, amazingly strong, but lonely character. She too grows as the series progresses.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: (?/10)<br />
This show… is hard to describe in terms of enjoyment... At first, it was fun because it reminded me of a cool game (7/10). As it progressed, the initial excitement died down (5/10). It was very predictable up until a certain point, but things started becoming less predictable as it progressed (7/10). Some of the plot twists were cool, but the plot twists towards the end were just plain stupid (2/10).  In fact, I was legitimately shocked by how ridiculous and incoherent it started getting. It&#039;s definitely more suited to a younger less mature audience, but there are some aspects of the anime that are unexpectedly dark for a kids show. An older audience may still enjoy it because it&#039;s somewhat entertaining (maybe), although you probably won&#039;t be able to relate to it much as an older individual. <br />
<br />
TL;DR <br />
Overall: (5/10)<br />
The story progressed too slowly, they took too long to develop the MCs, the characters were too cliche, but the anime wasn’t all that bad and actually had a decent amount of good moments. The show is bearable, but I wouldn’t recommend this anime to you unless you’ve already seen a bunch of the other top shounen out there. So basically, it was pretty bad and I think your time would be better spent elsewhere. <br />
<br />
“Do I recommend this to you personally?”<br />
Personally? Absolutely not. I could never wholeheartedly recommend this anime to anyone. It’s just something I watched to kill time.<br />
<br />
However, if you like exorcists and shounen anime, are younger than 16, and like slow stories, then maybe you should give it a shot someday. <br />
<br />
If you want realistic and mature characters, then no you should look elsewhere.<br />
<br />
In fact, you probably should just look elsewhere unless you’re out of anime to watch. <br />
<br />
I strongly recommend that you check out these other similar, but better exorcist/demon-related shounen anime first if you haven’t already:<br />
1. D. Gray Man 9/10 (103 eps) The second season 8/10 (13 eps) came 10 years later <br />
2. Bleach 9/10 (366 eps)<br />
3. Ao no Exorcist 9/10 (37 eps between 2 seasons)<br />
4. Nurarihyon no Mago 9/10  (50 eps between 2 seasons)<br />
5. Shakugan no Shana 8/10 (76 eps between 3 seasons)<br />

    Dropped after episode 29.<br />
Sousei no Onmyouji is Spring 2016 season&#039;s average shounen anime with a theme that has already been used many times. It might seem at least a bit nice at first but, it quickly becomes a somewhat repetitive and uninteresting ride. However, the anime has a little special charm of its own and decently developed characters (at least, before the original arc). But, is that enough to call Sousei no Onmyouji a good anime?<br />
<br />
Story: 4/10<br />
The story of Sousei no Onmyouji, isn&#039;t something new or very original, as we have already seen lots of anime that center on certain people who possess a special

          <span style="display: none;" id="review217886">
        ability (Exorcists) and fight against supernatural enemies (Kegare) in order to protect the world. The problem is not that it uses an overused theme, the anime does have a little charm of its own but, it doesn&#039;t manage it in a way that will make it less cliché. Also, it doesn&#039;t give anything interesting enough to get hooked on and you just end up watching a story with almost no impact on you. The story had potential to be much better but, it depended on predictable shounen elements and was pretty much wasted. <br />
The romance between the two main characters shows a little progression after a few episodes and some of their interactions contribute to it. Although, there are others which are only supposed to be funny but, they end up meaningless and annoying. The humor of the show isn&#039;t that funny, most of the jokes fall flat and they even repeat some of them often. The random fan-service that they add from time to time, also, feels out of place and doesn&#039;t contribute to any aspect of the anime. <br />
Putting a filler arc after a major time-skip that would have contributed to the development of the main characters and their relationship, wasn&#039;t a good idea, either. At the end of episode 20, the main characters decide to live in a different place together for a couple of years in order to become stronger. So, you would expect them to become stronger, more developed as characters and their relationship to actually have progressed a little, right? Unfortunately, due to the arc following the time skip being an anime original, they probably didn&#039;t know how to handle the story and characters in a way that will actually make it obvious that two whole years have passed so, everything remained the same and the time-skip didn&#039;t even make any sense.  <br />
<br />
Characters: 5/10<br />
At first, the characters seem as dull and insignificant as the story. Their personalities may still be kind of flat and boring but, their chemistry, interactions and development is what makes things better.<br />
The protagonist, Rokuro, seems to be a powerful character who doesn&#039;t want to return to being an Exorcist, because of a dramatic childhood experience. He is the kind of MC with not much depth, mostly cheerful but, kind of annoying, too, wants to always protect others and become stronger and his actions are all predictable.<br />
The main female character, Benio, also didn&#039;t use to have much to be described with. She was the cool and silent type of character and another powerful Exorcist but, after a few episodes, she showed us a friendlier and more sensitive side of her.<br />
The two main characters may receive development after a lot of episodes, but it happens in pretty much the same way all the time. Something bad happens, they think they are strong and they can face it, they fail, they get angry and cry, they get overpowered, they win. Then again the same thing from the beginning. It is a positive thing that they received character development but, the way it is done can end up repetitive and not very exciting.<br />
The chemistry between them has become better. They got to know and care about each other more, each of them wants to protect the other and they feel stronger when they fight together. Their more romantic interactions can sometimes be funny and cute and actually contribute to the development of their relationship but, there are times that they can be pretty meaningless and cliché.<br />
Unfortunately, despite all the development they managed to get, they remained completely the same after the time-skip, which makes you wonder if it was even necessary.<br />
The rest of the cast is rather forgettable, most of the characters are just there to fill their role and they receive little to no development, at all.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation: 5/10<br />
The art of Sousei no Onmyouji may not the best and most detailed out there, but it&#039;s quite satisfying. Although, personally, I&#039;m not really a fan of the art style and the bright colours, but that&#039;s a matter of opinion, and it may also be a good point of the anime, because it gives it a somewhat special touch. The biggest problem here is how terrible the animation is most of the time. Scenes that are often reused, the same movement patterns again and again, overusing images with no motion at all and generally, the show is poorly animated. It might be something that you can get used to quite easily, but it is kind of off-putting to watch action scenes without the impact that they should have.<br />
Fortunately, as more episodes come out, art and animation seem to become slightly better, although I wish they were at the level of the 2nd OP of the series, only this one was really well done when it comes to animation.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
There is not much to say here, as the first OP (&quot;Valkyrie -Ikusa Otome-&quot; by Wagakki Band) and ED (&quot;Eyes&quot; by Hitomi Kaji) seem to be fine and the OST is decent enough, but they become uninteresting after a while. The second ED (&quot;Yadoriboshi&quot; by Itowokashi) wasn&#039;t significant either, but the second OP (&quot;Re:Call&quot; by i☆Ris) was actually quite good and the animation was the best they&#039;ve used so far. The third OP (&quot;Sync&quot; by lol) is rather bland and the first part can feel a little out of place but, the third ED (&quot;Hide and Seek&quot; by Girlfriend) is more lively and enjoyable than the other two.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 2/10<br />
I don&#039;t really think that Sousei no Onmyouji can offer much enjoyment, watching it ended up a chore after a few episodes and the original arc made everything worse.<br />
Sousei no Onmyouji has some cool classic shounen moments but, they are not extremely worth watching and there are other anime where they are done better. The humor isn&#039;t the strong point of the anime, as most of the jokes fall flat and it gets repetitive after a while. If you like romance in shounen anime, this one offers some but, don&#039;t expect too much. <br />
<br />
Overall: 4/10<br />
Sousei no Onmyouji falls into a category of anime with a theme which has been used many times by series greater and more amusing. There are many things that could be done about the story, characters and animation to become better but, it ended up as wasted potential. If you don&#039;t mind watching another average shounen anime with nothing much to offer to the genre, you can go ahead and give it a try.

    The word &#039;adaptation&#039; for anime has quite a flexible definition.  Most often, the term &#039;adaptation&#039; means that the production company takes the source material and tries their best to make a carbon copy of the series that they decided to make in animated form.  But at the same time, the word &#039;adaptation&#039; can mean &quot;based on&quot; the original source material, and have their own anime-original plots and endings that contradict what the original series may have entailed.  Twinstar Exorcists, or Sousei no Omnyouji is an example of the latter.  <br />
<br />
Story: The world we live in is a place that exists parallel

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243965">
        to its antithesis, a place known as Magano.  In it, the negative thoughts of humans merge together and form creatures of corruption and sin known as &#039;Kegare&#039;.  Kegare feed off of the spirtual power of humans and are destructive creatures that threaten the world we know.  In order to combat this, there are people known as Omnyouji with high spiritual power and battle the Kegare in a never-ending war to save humanity from their power.  To save humanity, the power of the Miko, a being born from the twinstar exorcists must be brought into the world.  Who are the twinstar exorcists?  Some shithead named Rokuro and an equally prissy girl named Benio.  Oh boy...<br />
<br />
Omnyouji&#039;s story is in short, arduous.  Spanning 50 episodes of content, what we&#039;re given as a plot is, in simple terms, a slew of shonen tropes that span from the power of friendship, all the way to wanting to save everybody, and sudden bursts of power because, plot convenience.  Despite being an adaptation of a relatively popular series, Omnyouji doesn&#039;t have much to offer.  It becomes painfully easy to see what comes our way, and a lot of what it is boils down to ham-handed philosophies of two opponents fighting each other with fists clenched while shouting each other&#039;s names.  Rinse and repeat that process over twenty times over, and you have what roughly equates to the entire show&#039;s runtime in a flash.<br />
<br />
The main attributer as to why the show is so devoid of any originality or interesting developments is because, rather than following what the manga had already mapped out for Perriot to adapt, the studio decided to take a different turn and by Episode 20, change the show&#039;s path down an anime original path that has no connection to its original source material at all.  This proved to be a very big contributor as to why the show has such big flaws with its story, as the saga we&#039;re introduced to turns the show into a display of power as our protagonists &quot;get stronger&quot; as more and more opponents get introduced for no other reason than to make the penultimate plot of &quot;The end of the world is coming&quot; a reality for the end so that the show would have some form of grand finale.  <br />
<br />
Another problem comes with how I feel as though the show had too much time.  Most often than not, the case of screentime boils down to not having enough time for a series in order to tell the story that was intended.  Many episodes felt like throwaway episodes, as the show would squander its screentime with flashbacks that have already been shown many times over, recaps of what happened in the last ten or so episodes, or would have episodes solely devoted to talking just to fill up the twenty-four minutes that were allotted for the episode.  As such, episodes like this added to the weariness of how Omnyouji displayed itself, making the what was already tedious, even more tedious to watch.<br />
<br />
Omnyouji&#039;s problems arose when trying to milk what had already been drained dry.  The show doesn&#039;t try anything new in the realm of shonen anime, as the roughly twenty five hours it takes to watch this series can be described with just a tropes that almost every shonen anime uses in its plotline.  That, combined with how slow some of the episodes feel, and how predictable everything is, ultimately creates a tiring experience that isn&#039;t worth the time or effort to have.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
- All the shonen tropes<br />
- Predictable story<br />
- Many pointless episodes<br />
- Deviation from the source material did not work<br />
<br />
Characters: Likewise, characters have the similar problem with being your run of the mill shonen tropes without what seems like little to no thought with how to make them interesting beyond what they&#039;re given.<br />
<br />
Both of our main characters, Enmado Rokuro and Adashino Benio start off the series hating each other&#039;s guts.  With the series intentionally pairing them up in order to bring the Miko into the world, it&#039;s no surprise by what the end result of the series becomes.  The pair of Omnyouji are as expected.  You have the reckless, brash boy who listens to no one and wants to get stronger with his own strength and his own merits, and you have the girl who doesn&#039;t like the boy (at the beginning) who also wants to get stronger and basically has the exact same goals that the boy does.  The character progression for the relationship between these two is noticeable and gradual, which is something that I believe that the show does well on.  However, as far as everything else is concerned, that&#039;s about where the positives end.  Their goals are nothing special, their progression is somewhat minimal, and the show makes it very hard for them to lose.  They may struggle, but everything turns out extremely ok at the end.  They&#039;re boring.  They&#039;re boring because the show doesn&#039;t even attempt to make their pains and struggles seem minimal when everything just comes to them so easily, and it becomes very hard to care for characters who despite everything, have plot armor so thick that not even someone who is virtually god can&#039;t break through it.<br />
<br />
As far as villains go, most if not all can be described as characters who have a single goal that serves as an obstacle that can easily be overcome once given enough episodes.  Become the best, take over the world, destroy humanity; all of these goals have been done over and over again in more interesting ways that have been displayed here.  It doesn&#039;t help that the villains spend more time talking than executing their evil plan, or hell, let the protagonist live when they could easily kill them, so they become minor hurdles that the characters have to jump over to continue on with the story.  <br />
<br />
Side characters are a wide bunch that, like most long-running shonen series, are either the friends that the main protagonists are fighting for, and are the less than stellar characters of the same kind who will never amount to anything when compared to the feats that the main protagonists have achieved.  They&#039;re your standard group of side characters in a shonen series, and there&#039;re very few if any noteworthy characters to talk about since they&#039;re largely tropes like; the third wheel, the mentor, the annoying mascot, and rivals.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Character development for the protagonists<br />
-  Entire cast feels like a giant soup of tropes<br />
<br />
Art: Perriot&#039;s art shines as an example of inconsistency and quality issues.  While normally the show has a lot of blunt and bright colors that are less than stellar in quality, the main problem with Omnyouji&#039;s art is how consistent the company is with making their scenes.  <br />
<br />
When the show wants to, the lighting and the shadows can make the scene look good enough to actually look good.  However, when the show doesn&#039;t want to, the art looks like a mess of colors combined with clear flaws in the details when it comes to characters&#039; appearance.  Fight scenes in a supposedly action heavy series are mostly characters standing and talking about each of their side and philosophies while not mercilessly beating the crap out of each other.  A one-two punch, a lot of talking, some more punching, a lot more talking, and end the fight.  The fight scenes hardly have any &#039;fight&#039; in them, so they feel very disengaging and unexciting to watch.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Can look good<br />
- Largely inconsistent<br />
- Minimalistic fight scenes<br />
<br />
Sound: Omnyouji&#039;s soundtracks are not memorable.  Being roughly 4 cours long, the show has 4 pairs of OPs and EDs that help run the show&#039;s opening and ending bits to section off each of the four parts that the show&#039;s in.  Despite having watched all of the songs in full, none of the tracks stick out to me in my head as something that was both enjoyable or memorable.  So if you ask me, the tracks are not worth your time.<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment: It&#039;s been about a year since I started watching the first episode, and I honestly can&#039;t remember the reason why I even started it in the first place.  Coming out of it though, Omnyouji stands as a show that ultimately was a huge waste of time.  Nothing about it made me excited about watching the next episode, and slogging through episode after episode felt like a tiring excavation to find any glint of originality to make me interested in the series.  The shift from the source material certainly didn&#039;t help its case, as the random encounters with new anime-original villains didn&#039;t do anything but make the series even more difficult to like.  <br />
<br />
Did I like this series?<br />
<br />
For me, there&#039;s nothing to like.  You can find better examples of everything this show did elsewhere.<br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I like about this series?<br />
<br />
Though I&#039;m tempted to say &#039;everything&#039;, the biggest problem I had was with Benio&#039;s shikigami, Kinako.  Kinako&#039;s high screechy voice shouting at the top of his lungs was like nails on a chalkboard.  He wasn&#039;t cute, was extremely annoying, and became a huge hindrance to the series because his constant shouting and attempts at &#039;helping&#039; had me in a tizzy on whether or not I should finish the show, or quit halfway.<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this anime?<br />
<br />
To me, Omnyouji is not worth it.  Reusing almost every shonen trope that exists, Omnyouji&#039;s adaptation has almost nothing original about it as its largely anime-original plot turns its 50 episode runtime into a bingo game to see if you can get a bingo from all of the tropes that they shove into the series.  Its lack of originality makes it a tiring experience to have, and I for one am thankful that it&#039;s over.  Because there is no way I&#039;m ever going to watch a 50 episode on-going series ever again.

~ If I had one dollar for every time someone said &quot;I want to get stronger&quot; during the anime, I would have been rich!~<br />
<br />
Characters: I liked the affectionate involvement of the main characters, Benio and Rokuro. They grow and mature throughout the series, they support and motive each other in order to achieve their goal.<br />
<br />
Story: The plot unfolds slowly and personally I got bored. It got a bit tedious and monotonous as we watch the protagonists &quot;getting stronger&quot; while more and more opponents appear. Unnecessary scenes and characters.<br />
The comedy was funny. Maybe it was one of they best aspects of the series.

        <br />
<br />
Art: The style and quality of the art change during the series. The characters design was really poor in some episodes, their faces looked like they were drawn by a child. However, other scenes were detailed designed with beautiful colours.<br />
<br />
Sound: The music caught my attention! The #3 opening song is my favorite:)<br />
The background music was fitting the atmosphere, very good work!<br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s 7/10. I suggest you give it a try!

    In a world full of Shonen series Twin Star Exorcists will defently NOT change anything about it, but with even that i stonrgly recomend you to give this sereis a chance.<br />
<br />
The story is focused is these two characters, Rokuro and Benio is their livas as exosist who fight an evil known as Kegare.<br />
You may like to know from the start the this series only take the premise of the original source of the mange for the first 20 episodes, while the other 30 s an anime original story, with 8 or so episodes with a &quot;monster of the week&quot; progression with the rest of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243917">
        episodes for the final arc and finale but is not as you might think, the so-called &quot;filler&quot; it will be actually some what relevant to the ofthe story, (just a little)  never the less, it could it be shorter. BTW It gets and actual ending, i mean, if this is what we got from TSE im satiesfied(6/10)<br />
<br />
As usual in a seres who is make week by week for  a full year, it might suffer for the inconstanst quiality in the animation, but is fairly consistent trough the whole series. There are moments where you will say, &quot;this look good&quot;, at other times you will say... &quot;ahhh ok...&quot; (6/10)<br />
<br />
Im not a musician i cant jugde the OST from that view, but i can say it gets the job done, you&#039;ll remember the songs time to time but they will not get stuck in your head or wanna add them to your playlists<br />
Except the OP and ED, props to all of them, specially the 2nd OP and the 3er ED (7/10)<br />
<br />
I think the strongest thing this series are their characters, the series focus a lot in the relatioship between Benio and Rokuro, how in the begening they hate each other to accept their flaws and praise their strengns. <br />
While in the other hand they neglet mostly of the support cast, wich are really good, each character of the supporting cast has their own story but only some of them get screentime to develop that, while other doesnt get any at all, but i see this was done to focus in the protagonists (7/10)<br />
<br />
My personal experience was week by week, sometimes i ended really satisfied for what i watched and enjoyed, other times i ended dissapointed BUT with the hope that it would be better the next week. But yeah i enjoy it all, just not that much some weeks

<br />
I haven&#039;t Read the manga.<br />
<br />
The Story is pretty cliche i have to admit. But, the plot progression keeps you interested. <br />
<br />
I have so little to say about the art. but not because its bad but because i don&#039;t know how to explain it. I&#039;ve seen many anime&#039;s where the art didn&#039;t even deserve a rating. there is literally about a handful of anime&#039;s that have a rating that&#039;s above a 6 in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I have nothing to say, what&#039;s great is great. but i gave it a 9/10 not just because i liked it but because just fit with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review225011">
        the anime like a puzzle meshed together well.<br />
<br />
I have nothing bad to say but i wished they put a little bit more detail into the MC&#039;s personality&#039;s. Benio is cold hearted and non-sociable but on the inside she&#039;s sweet kind and caring, you just have to get to know her. while the other MC is hot headed, hot blooded, and annoying but when he is in battle all of that changes you could call it an alter ego, he becomes brave, strong, and serious but it&#039;s not just that but his friends mean more to him than anything.<br />
<br />
My enjoyment is purely and solely on my opinion. the reason i gave it a 10/10 is because i judge every anime i watch on their first episode so if this anime&#039;s first episode didn&#039;t interest me i wouldn&#039;t have watched the rest of the anime and most likely wouldn&#039;t have reviewed.<br />
<br />
Overall if you don&#039;t like cliche&#039;s then i would strongly suggest that you don&#039;t watch this anime, while as the plot is a cliche the first episode is a cliche in it&#039;s self. But you you don&#039;t care go ahead, other than that there shouldn&#039;t be anything you would be disappointed about unless it&#039;s your own opinion about something wrong in the anime.

    I hope to god that Sousei no Onmyouji truly is 50 episodes or more. I have loved it to death from episode 1; the art and music just keep getting better and better. The character development is phenomenal. There has actually been a few instances in which I was surprised on the direction and events of the story, and being surprised by such a thing is almost always good. I find myself cringing at the thought of needing to wait a week for each episode. The relationship between the two main characters (Benio and Rokuro) is a gloriously refreshing spin on the commonly used trope

    So I see a lot of people give this show negative reviews, usually 4&#039;s, but let me tell you, it&#039;s worse than that. <br />
<br />
This show is literally the most generic thing ever. It has nothing going for it at all. The characters suck, the romance that&#039;s forced on the characters sucks and has no bearing on the series as a whole, the art sucks and the fights are boring, and the story is overdone to all hell. We get it, for no real reason, these two characters gotta make a baby. <br />
<br />
So the two main characters are a tsundere boy and a kuudere girl. Tsundere

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220378">
        boy has a tragic past and doesn&#039;t want to be an exorcist, but he&#039;s not good at anything else. At all. He&#039;s horrible at everything but he has the overpowered ability but they even managed to make that boring because he only really uses that one ability and it&#039;s just a punch. The kuudere girl is also overpowered, she&#039;s smart, she&#039;s cute and is better than the boy in every way. They try to give her a personality but the writers just make her do whatever to fit the scene, rather than have her character naturally react to what happens in the scene. Every other character is uninteresting or annoying, especially the girl&#039;s pet and the head exorcist guy. <br />
<br />
The art consists mainly of stills in fight scenes and there&#039;s nothing interesting about it. It&#039;s a very &quot;anime&quot; art style that people who don&#039;t know much about anime would imagine every show looks like. The colors are kinda interesting sometimes, but not that eye catching. <br />
<br />
The story is literally just, &quot;you two make a baby that will be ultra strong lol. But we don&#039;t wanna. WELL I&#039;LL MAKE YOU BY MAKING YOU DO STUPID STUFF THAT WILL HOPEFULLY MAKE YOU LIKE EACHOTHER&quot; Anime like this where the story relies on romance, but for whatever reason the romance is actively avoided by the characters really annoy me. For the most part, the two main characters avoid the romance and don&#039;t even really talk about or even consider their &quot;destiny&quot;. They both care about getting rid of the bad guys and protecting their friends, but they won&#039;t even consider just making a baby so they could permanently destroy the bad guys. It just doesn&#039;t make sense, it&#039;s not a human story and you can&#039;t relate to the characters at all. <br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s just painfully generic and boring. Nothing standout about this show, but it seems to be quite popular. Can&#039;t even say there was effort put into this because it&#039;s horribly cookie-cutter and generic.

    [Note: I dropped this after thirteen episodes, so you can’t really say I didn’t give it a chance; if this show couldn’t be good after one cour then I don’t expect it to be worth watching the next three.]<br />
<br />
Studio Pierrot are the guys using Internet Explorer. It took them almost two years to realize the Naruto manga was over and they can stop doing anime fillers, and now they’re doing this show called Twin Star Exorcists (listed here as Sousei no Onmyouji), an anime that feels like it should’ve been released a good ten years ago. Main character has a rowdy side of his otherwise

          <span style="display: none;" id="review223284">
        casual personality that comes with a tragic backstory, and he wants to be the best at whatever; main heroine is actually good at whatever, pretty attractive but not fanservice-y, hates the MC for whatever reason but you know they’re gonna fuck someday anyway, and they have to fight some stuff. Lots of fighting. Yippee. <br />
<br />
“Oh boy, this guy’s another elitist who just complains about shows by comparing it to other anime!” Nah, I’m okay with shows being similar; in fact, some of the frontrunners that aired alongside this show are pretty basic and I love them a lot, but they have their reasons for being watchable. Sousei doesn’t do a lot to differentiate itself from the tropes it uses; most of its appeal as an action is merely weighted on its gimmicky combat, which incorporates traditional Japanese elements a bit. <br />
<br />
- TRADITIONAL JAPENESE ELEMENTS - *poof*<br />
HYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br />
<br />
That’s every fucking fight. Someone will say an attack, then time will stop so the name of the attack can appear on the screen and the person can yell. Does it look cool? Yes. But just because it looks cool doesn’t mean it’s necessary, so after about two instances it gets pretty damn irritating and makes me feel like I’m being looked down upon.<br />
<br />
Actually, Sousei just seems to look down on its viewers in general. A lot. One of several things is that whenever someone reflects upon something, a terrible-looking flashback will be shown of that event or quote, even if it happened five minutes prior. Even worse is that a character was made exclusively for the anime, whose only purpose is to suck the heroine’s dick. EVERYTHING that’s said by this Victini-looking motherfucker is just to make play up how badass Benio is so that maybe you’ll like her more. “HEY, IMP! (?) YOUR USELESS ASS IS HOLDING BACK BENIO’S AMAZING TALENT!!!” This isn’t complicated writing, Pierrot. Mommy says I’m a big boy now, so I can understand basic human emotions all by my alone.<br />
<br />
If you actually want to know what the story’s about and don’t want to read the synopsis or other “objective” reviewers, it’s about our world if it had a bunch of creepy, weirdo interdimensional things called ‘karaage’, which… do… bad things. To people. Come to think of it, I don’t remember getting a good explanation of these things. Except that they’re bad. Are they bad? I guess they’re bad… They look creepy so they must be bad. And then people who aren’t bad perform exorcisms on them; in other words they do action-y stuff in special costumes and use magic with talismen.<br />
<br />
- TALISMEN - *poof*<br />
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<br />
<br />
That also has something to do with it, I guess.<br />
<br />
The real kick of this story is that the two main characters are being forced to get married, hook up, and have a kid together. Twin Star Exorcists? More like Twin Star SEXorcists!!! AHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br />
<br />
Anyway, they need to breed because somehow their kid will inevitably become the Hokag--ehsorry the Miko or whatever. Which is like the best exorcist ever. This kills the karaage. I appreciate that Sousei doesn’t beat around the bush with these two, you know they’re gonna hook up by the end anyway, but now that fanfiction-generating quirk has actual weight to the story. And instead of having the two fuck like wild rabbits, they have a typical but effective dichotomy between liking and hating each other. I’ll admit that I don’t like Rokuro much, but Benio’s cool, and more importantly they have a weird chemistry that makes their relationship fun sometimes.<br />
<br />
“Don’t forget about their complicated backstories!”<br />
Yeah… I won’t talk about how corny that is. You can probably find the basics of it on 4chan’s “write an anime plot” threads.<br />
<br />
The backstory and villainous reveal could actually considered to be a good part of the series, as it adds a lot of drama and really darkens the story even if it wasn’t all that cheery to begin with, but it plays out in such a typical and over-the-top way that I started to laugh at it instead. But, to be knocked down means you come back stronger, right? So after a grim reveal and crushing defeat comes… an awkward couple of episodes of the two kids “training” by “bonding” together through some weird exercises. Oh. <br />
<br />
Since the romance is what makes Shipping no Onmyouji possibly stand out in the crowd, they should make it count, right? …Eh. One, the characters aren’t that interesting to begin with. Two, a lot of it is just… awkward. Much of it is forced--no, literally, it’s forced by other characters because they want them to fuck immediately so they can have a kid and so the kid can save everyone, and so Benio and Rokuro get thrown into some strange shenanigans that force them to cooperate. Oh boy, I really feel the love in the air! I think putting the two in a nice villa was a good move, but everything else just seemed excessive and annoying. Little of it is about Rokuro and Benio growing as people and getting attached to each other, it’s about them reluctantly playing a shitty game by one of their bosses. I guess down the line this could evolve into a good romance, but I think thirteen episodes is a bit too long of a wait for what should be a major draw to this series.<br />
<br />
Last thing I’ll mention before moving on, but there’s a lot of filler in this anime, as could be expected from a fifty-episode series by Pierrot. A lot of episodes have some sort of nonsense going on between Rokuro and Benio, and to make it seem important somehow, the firefox fuckwit mascot character will make an incredibly irritating scream about karaage showing up, so a little bit of action will happen. There’s slow pacing, and in the case of Sousei, there’s just general dicking around.<br />
<br />
Alright, now the art. This has potential, I’ll give it that. If this show was brought down to even two cours, this would probably look pretty great. But unfortunately, Pierrot doesn’t want to spend all eighty-nine quadrillionteen yen they made off Osomatsu-san to make the whole product look good. Therefore, faces often look janky and off-model at even the slightest of distances, and what little animation Sousei has is pretty weak. The actual character designs look good, though, with some rather beautiful eyes (to the animator guy saying that eyes take too long to draw nowadays, sorry) and good clothing. Rokuro has some weird shark teeth, but I think it’s okay given his character and design.<br />
<br />
Stylistically, it’s interesting. The action takes place in another dimension, a very desolate and apocalyptic-looking dimension with a lot of red shading and outlines. The karaage are incredibly off-putting, weird, shadowy monsters that occupy it; altogether it brings about an interesting setting. Unfortunately, the setting is all it can be: a setting, so it doesn’t make the actual fights look great, which is a shame because I quite like the idea of using magic with talismen and shit.<br />
<br />
Less ideally, all the flashbacks seem to have been filmed from an iPhone; the aspect ratio becomes more vertical and looks super awkward, and they fill the empty spaces on the sides with some distracting, scratchy graphics. What’s with this weird design? If this was trying to be original, that doesn’t mean it was a good idea either way. And since this is your average shounen, get ready for 25% of the episode to be composed of flashbacks.<br />
<br />
The one notable thing about the sound is the hellish, creepy “voices” of the karaage. It’s fucking bizarre and I love it. Other than that, everything here’s another mixed bag of mediocre. The OP is by Wagakki Band, another interesting gimmick J-rock band that combines hard rock with traditional Japanese elements.<br />
<br />
- TRADITIONAL JAPANEoh i did this meme already.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you’re into Japanese music these days, you’ve probably heard of their song, Senbonzakura, which blends these styles really well. Valkyrie, the Sousei OP, is a different story; the song itself sounds decent, but if you took out the traditional instruments then you wouldn’t have much of a difference. Thematically, it’s still a good choice for the show, I guess. The actual OST should’ve taken some notes with Wagakki Band’s ideas by blending traditional and modern sounds; instead it just sounds modern with some shitty electronic music playing in the back of the fights and some softer piano tunes wherever else. <br />
<br />
Would I recommend Sousei no Onmyouji? Based off of this first cour, I wouldn’t. There are some good ideas, but nothing’s really getting done here, and saying “it gets better later” doesn’t really prove a point. In the six+ hours it’ll take for Sousei to “get better” you could… read the manga, which people have apologetically claimed to be a much better experience, and given the amount of filler here I can see that. <br />
<br />
Would I recommend Sousei no Onmyouji? ...More like NOsei!!! 0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o<br />

    So to begin im giving way too high scores. But i tell you why. The story is nothing too special and most overused premise &quot;KILL ALL THE TITANS, GHOULS, what ever owair no sepha has&quot;. The characters at first are basic and nothing special. But the arc types of the characters are pretty good and enjoyable. But im going to judge them more of their manga counter-parts. And if the anime follows the manga character growth will be huge and the character may not be the most original but they become great characters in a arc type not used often and done to great affect.<br />

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220592">
        saving grace(Sill not enough for the amount of points i given out but im a nice guy.) It got to be some of the jokes and comedy, well most is not really that funny or new (Hell it falls into the normal hole as other actions.) But when it does make a good joke or a new one its is quite funny.  I have not laugh that hard since OPM and his &quot;OK&quot;<br />
Oh and one last thing im a sucker for is a cute ship. And this one is really cute and probably the best this season (Super lovers aint far behind tho.) And i like how it develops and is used pretty well along the action. (Which is something lot of these kinds of animes fail at. but this like everything else is coming from the manga. The anime it self as it stands is probably as good as the reviews say 7.1. But if the anime follows the manga their nothing to fear. And the animation will be a huge plus moreso with some huge fights coming up. The animation is probably the only saving grace right now for the anime besides the ship.0 <br />
Overall this review is irreverent to the anime but more like the anime and manga. and yes i know i gave WAY too high marks but i enjoy it this anime a lot and feel bias towards it thanks to the manga and im just a nice person. Hell i gave school days a 7. (Maybe im too nice)

    This anime is a masterpiece! Keep it up! Don&#039;t end it that soon.<br />
I want you guys more of this to do, don&#039;t end it too early at least +35 episodes believe me people will start talking about it more and more and even more. I believe in that this Anime will be one of the greatest and remembered as that. <br />
My opinion is +10, all of the episodes are great  I suppose I haven&#039;t watched them but episode after episode it gets even better and better!!<br />
I&#039;ll share this anime to my friends and  I would recommend it even to watch it. I am

          <span style="display: none;" id="review224867">
        really proud of that Anime it isn&#039;t that bad. Still it will be added to my favorited collection. <br />
I liked the Anime because for me it feels great and also changes my feelings about it, the movements are great, voice actors, story, sounds, art, and the whole career and I feel like now when they enter the other world, it is pretty danger and it&#039;s like anybody could die anytime.

    Okay, it should be noted that I went into this anime from being a reader of the manga, so my view may be a little skewed.<br />
<br />
Now for the good points:<br />
The art is actually pretty good, and the sounds are enjoyable,  it has good music and over all decent voice acting, though I find it irritating that the CHILDREN sound like adults. It is annoying the fact that they aren&#039;t made to sound a little more immature and kiddie.<br />
<br />
Now the bad:<br />
-Most of the story seems to be filler.<br />
<br />
-They added too many original characters and moved in characters shown later in the series much earlier as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221563">
        well.<br />
<br />
-They keep on showing the names of the attacks which added to some of the many spaces in the series just seem to add a few minutes to each episode, and it happening in 12 episodes, it&#039;s like they added a whole episode of wasted space (and not counting filler plot).<br />
<br />
-They focused a lot on stuff that didn&#039;t need too much focus and rushed through many of the important points and there were tons of needless filler adventure that didn&#039;t seem necessary to the story.<br />
<br />
-The characters don&#039;t actually seem as interesting in this as in the manga. The manga was actually MORE fast paced than the anime (which is strange).<br />
<br />
-Also, I disliked how they showed a lot more focus on the childhood friend&#039;s crush on the MC, it was kinda a down turn. In the manga, she was implied to have feelings, but it wasn&#039;t directly shown.<br />
<br />
All-in-all:<br />
The story feels pretty dragged out, it isn&#039;t that great of an adaption with needless filler and gaps and adding characters that were obvious mascots (which wouldn&#039;t be much of a problem if they made it more important to the story, and also made the story more interesting).<br />
<br />
Only the art and good music were able to make me not completely abandon this.<br />
<br />
The story and characters were poor, and the enjoyment was made even worse because I kept on comparing it to the original source.<br />
<br />
I cannot recommend this anime to people. If you want to skip one, this is one to skip.

    FAST REVIEW BASED ON 10 EPISODES:<br />
<br />
Sousei no Onmyouji, it starts in a slow pace, but try to give it a chance; it&#039;s a decent anime.<br />
<br />
Everything at the beginning it&#039;s very stereotypical, &quot;loud guy with potential to do great things&quot;, if you like shonen genre, you&#039;re going to like this one.<br />
<br />
I gave it a chance and actually SURPRISED me after a few episodes!<br />
<br />
Art: 9.0 - Everything is beautiful, colorful at the &quot;Normal world&quot; and creepy at the &quot;Demon world&quot;, it makes a really good contrast. (Why is it not 10? Except for the &quot;Demon world&quot;, the other scenes seems to be generic.)<br />
<br />
Sound: 8.0 - The Opening/Soundtracks/Dubbing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220310">
        they fit in the Universe/Scene/Characters. (Why is it not 10? Except for the Opening, you can&#039;t really remember the soundtrack of the fights.) <br />
<br />
Story: 8.0 - If you have patience to wait for the story develop, it&#039;s going to reward you. It gets really interesting. (Why is not 10? Even if it gets interesting, it somehow feels &quot;cliche&quot; it follows the old shounen recipes with it&#039;s own pecularities.)

    In a word: Speechless. This anime is amazing. The plot twisted so much it probably would have looked like a towel being wrung out if you could see a plot. Threw me an almost infinite number loops. Main characters have absolutely amazing backstories. The antagonist is so ridiculously cruel that I wish he was real so we could drop a nuke on him. (And for somebody who doesn&#039;t even exist to get me this riled up is a feat in itself.) The art is glorious. The sound is flawless, and the one mistake I could find was so miniscule that it couldn&#039;t detract from the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review232910">
        overall score I gave it if it wanted to. Overall, this site&#039;s scoring system is too weak to be accurate. I would have given it an infinity/10, but that couldn&#039;t be done. Simply sublime.<br />
Rokuro is my favorite character, followed closely by Benio, then Kinako, Mayura, Seigen, Ryogo, and so-on-so-forth. Watch. Read. Just see this serie, okay? Good, &#039;cause I&#039;m outta here!

    Yet again, much like with Hundred, here I am just checking to see how many episodes an anime will be this season and am utterly dumbfounded by the low rating the anime has. Hunred was slightly more understandable but THIS? Not TSE!!!! This was my anime of choice...before i started watching Re: Zero. So allow me to be a diamond in the rough, a review for those of you looking at the 3s and 4s overall in the other reviews and saying &quot;is this anime really that shitty?&quot; well I can assure you that it is not. Allow me to explain.<br />
<br />
The three main genre for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222192">
        this anime are Action, Shounen, and Romance (even though MAL doesn&#039;t even list it as a romance). These will be analyzed at the end. Now for the other stuff.<br />
<br />
Story (9/10):<br />
A lot of people might think it is your typical shounen anime. Main character has a rough past, hates his power, girl comes, changes his mind, now he&#039;s a total badass. Well this both is and is not exactly what I described. Are those the main components of the story? Well...yeah. But the anime just pulls of this typical shounen story so well.<br />
<br />
Rokuro had a legitimate reason to never want to fight again. He was scarred at such a young age, and I honestly felt for him. Then this girl comes along, who is not like our typical strong female in a shounen anime who is basically like &quot;Go main hero! Fight! Save the day! You are amazing!&quot; Nah, Benio-sama don&#039;t play that shit. Benio-sama gonna fuck shit up and if you wanna join just do not get in her way.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the story is pulled of really well so far, and there have been some plot twists that I shamefully did not see coming. Lumping this in with all other shounen anime would be a mistake, 9/10.<br />
<br />
Art (8/10):<br />
Unless something about art or sound really stands out, do not expect anything other than an 8 out of me. I do not give a flying shit about art or sound. Doesn&#039;t make my eyes hurt, 8/10.<br />
<br />
Sound (8/10):<br />
Same concept. Good voice actors/actresses for what it matters. The little rat dude that Benio has can get annoying, but he shuts up pretty quick. But seriously if you care so much about sound go watch the Sound of Music or something. Bleh, 8/10.<br />
<br />
Characters (10/10):<br />
Oooohhhh boyyyy, probably a really controversial rating. But I honestly love the characters in this anime. Rokuro and Benio fulfill there teenage pseudo-lovestruck roles extremely well and make the anime extremely funny at times. <br />
<br />
The head exorcist guy (although super sketchy, like seriously he&#039;s up to something) is interesting and moves their relationship further which is always good. <br />
<br />
Rokuro&#039;s other friend with the bountiful feast of melons is your typical osananaj-Fuck it-childhood friend, who is cute and sweet and cares about Rokuro so much, she&#039;s adorable and a great addition to the love triangle. <br />
<br />
Honestly the only slight flaw so far is that the anime has introduced some characters then just kind of not done anything with them. But with more episodes that would change, sooooooo I can&#039;t fault them for that yet.<br />
<br />
Overall the characters are entertaining and fun to watch, 10/10.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10/10):<br />
Every week I cannot wait to watch TSE. It&#039;s one of those anime that makes you want to write a review about it when shithea-oops, I mean respectable MAL reviewers who are allowed to have their own opinions- don&#039;t give it the credit it deserves. It&#039;s funny, serious at times, and the romance has been good so far.<br />
<br />
Overall (9/10):<br />
Time to break it down by genre:<br />
<br />
Romance:<br />
The kids are supposed to be in like 9th grade, so obviously they are inexperienced and shy and adorable. The love triangle between Rokuro, Benio, and Melons is actually pretty legit. Benio is clearly the favorite so far and I think Melons sees her as a legitimate threat to her being with Rokuro, which makes her act even more adorable and ah, it&#039;s just so good. And the blushes from Rokuro and Benio, staples of every romance anime, just amazing. <br />
<br />
Score: 9/10<br />
Composition: 40% (meaning I think the anime is about 40% romance(<br />
<br />
Shounen:<br />
Yeah...it&#039;s pretty damn shounen. But in a really good way. Rokuro is not so overpowered right away that he can one-punch everything (though he can one-punch a lot). And Benio is clearly needed for him to be a totally effective fighter, a trait that not most shounen anime have. I honestly think it is a big upgrade over typical shounen anime like Hundred.<br />
<br />
Score: 10/10<br />
Composition: 25%<br />
<br />
Action:<br />
I was actually surprised at how little action there is in the series since th first few episodes have quite a bit. However, the middle and later parts focus more on plot development leaving less time for fights. There are still plenty though, don&#039;t get me wrong, but the ones that are there are not quite as good as I would have liked and are typically very predictable (as with most shounen anime). But overall the fights keep the anime interesting and are starting to segue nicely into the romance parts...I like romance anime.<br />
<br />
Score: 8/10<br />
Composition: 35%<br />
<br />
Total:<br />
(8)(.35)+(9)(.4)+(10)(.25)= 8.85/10, rounded up=9/10<br />
<br />
Hope this review helped. I am trying to review more anime that I do not think get enough credit, and this certainly fits the bill.<br />
<br />

    If I&#039;m being 100% honest here, I almost dropped this anime after ep 3. But something told me to keep watching. So I did, and now it&#039;s in my top 10 favorite anime. <br />
There was something very sweet and innocent about this anime. I admit I had tears falling down my face in quite a few places. And I NEVER cry when watching anime. <br />
The story reminded me a lot of D. Gray-Man. The MC is both the savior and destroyer of the world. The main enemy, Basra, were just like the Noah. But this anime had more heart to it. <br />
Each character had their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300295">
        own challenges to overcome in order to become a stronger exorcist. Rather than being annoying with all the flashbacks, it helped make the story more immersive.  <br />
Unfortunately, the anime strayed away from the manga in some places. There were a few main characters in the anime that played little to no importance in the manga. and one character doesn&#039;t even exist in the manga, but she was one of the reasons I cried. <br />
The art and sound of the anime were almost stellar. It could just be the site I was using to stream, but there would be times when the voices wouldn&#039;t match up with the character&#039;s lips moving. Since this was only available in Sub, it wasn&#039;t a huge deal for me, but it is still annoying to know about. <br />
Overall I LOVED this anime, and can&#039;t wait for season 2!  Oh, one little thing though. If you think they&#039;re gonna kiss, then you best hold your breath a bit longer. It took them a long time to have their first kiss, and there may have been a huge battle going on behind them. It just added to the sweetness of their first kiss IMO. <br />
10/10 Would recommend. <br />
10/10 Will watch again. <br />

    I think its rather easy to underestimate this anime. I think the primary reason is because people are expecting a single cour anime that will get things over with. However, this is not the case with this anime. It progresses slowly, but it builds the characters and the world step by step.<br />
<br />
Its trying to do a lot. Its trying to be shounen and romance at the same time. It is trying to simultaneously write the heroic journey of two people, and that takes time.<br />
<br />
My advice is that you will enjoy this anime more and more as the show continues to progress, and as the characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review226264">
        are chiselled out from dull simplistic identities to characters with nuances. Managing to this, i.e. making an anime for the long haul and focusing on slowly fleshing out the relationships is difficult and takes time.<br />
<br />
This reminds me a lot of Steins;Gate. I hated the first 10 episodes. But later on it got so good that I couldn&#039;t stop watching. I still haven&#039;t watched the whole thing yet, but I sure hope that the anime series continues to improve both its characters and its story line.<br />
<br />
8/10.

    Sousei no Onmyouji is the best anime I&#039;ve ever seen. Well the anime respects the manga until episode 20 and after it&#039;s original story because the manga is lunar and the original story really went well and even really enjoyed it . I started to read the manga Sousei no onmyouji because i want to know the originaly story .<br />
After all, I ask you to look at the anime and read the manga are the same story but in different worlds. How to explain it better?<br />
<br />
Story 10/10<br />
Sousei no Onmyouji tells the story of two talented exorcists who are destined to become the &quot;Twin Star Exorcists&quot;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313647">
        and the prophesised parents of the Miko—the reincarnation of Abe no Seimei—who will cleanse the world of all impurities.<br />
<br />
Art 8/10<br />
Art has not been so good, but after a few episodes it has improved<br />
<br />
Sound 10/10<br />
I had no problems with the sounds<br />
<br />
Caracter 10/10<br />
Rokuro Enmadou, a young exorcist with a troubled past<br />
Benio Adashino is a prodigy exorcist<br />
<br />
Overall 10/10 <br />
I&#039;ve put 10 in this because i like the romance , and the story of this anime so much

    After watching first 20 to 25 episodes, you may think that this anime is good. That it has certain pattern which is very basic and done so many times but nevertheless the delevopment in the story is rapid.<br />
However, do not raise your expectations. This anime is very very average.<br />
I observed following signs of medeocrity and/or bad quality:<br />
<br />
* Characters are dense in terms of romance<br />
* Very average action although very loud.<br />
* Miserable attempt to serve exposition as dialogue<br />
* Kiss in the last episode<br />
* In a single episode, characters are interrupted twice when confessing (or equivalent) in a HANABI like style<br />
* There is cringey SAO like papa-mama

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407120">
        arc<br />
* Each episode features some kegare which is superstrong or unprecedented.<br />
* At some point 7-8 basaras are introduced which begs the question why don&#039;t they team up and defeat the 12 guardians. Many such questions appear as one watches this anime. There are very obvious plot holes and plot armours.<br />
<br />
I will recommend to not watch this show it you have something else in your PTW list.
