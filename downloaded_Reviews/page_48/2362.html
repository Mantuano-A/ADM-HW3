    Ah! My Goddess OVA is the first screen adaptation of the long running manga of the same name.  Considering its over 15 years old it actually holds its age pretty well.  It manages to be a sweet and charming romance and is probably a fairly influential title in regards to the whole &quot;Sudden Girlfriend Appearance&quot; genre of storylines.<br />
<br />
If you’ve seen even a few romance titles you have most likely already seen a similar plot before.  Though in its time this may have been pretty original.  A college student Keiichi dials a wrong number trying to order food from his dorm and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19253">
        is accidently connected to a Goddess helpline in which a mysterious girl Belldandy appears in his room promising to grant him any wish he wants.  The girlfriendless guy asks for someone like her to be by his side forever and thus the story begins.<br />

Usually in these kinds of stories there is a lot of echiiness but there is none of that here.  So if that sort of thing bothers you and just want to see a haremesque romance without the boobs and panty face plants then you will likely find this series appealing.  The relationship between Belldandy and Keiichi is the focal point of the series.  It’s for the most part sweet and satisfying despite the lack of any real intimacy.  This is always a peeve of mine in anime and I think it has something to do with the Japanese mindset.  The story does a great job of building chemistry and romance between the pair but they don’t act like a couple that is in love as much as we are lead to believe.  Not that I ever seem to expect it anymore but how can you be in love this much and get embarrassed still about holding hands and cuddling together, let alone kissing, after living in the same house for nine months?  It detracts overall from my score despite me liking this series a lot more than my score may reflect.<br />
<br />
The story&#039;s pacing also fluctuates and skips around quite a bit.  Many months will pass with really no way of even knowing this is happening without the dialogue telling us or from just visually seeing the seasons pass by.  But you would never know it from how little progress the leads make in terms of their romance.  The shortness of the series doesn&#039;t make having a really intricate plot feasible but it doesn’t really feel like its going anywhere until the last episode.  I don’t know how closely it follows the manga since I haven’t read it but overall the story and the ending are satisfyingly concluded.<br />
<br />
Keiichi is your standard male anime lead.  By standard I mean he’s not all that special.  Like almost all romance series the male love interest is usually uninteresting, weak, and not very manly.  Despite Keiichi being in college he looks like he should be starting the 8th grade.  Now this is played up in the story as to why he doesn’t have a girlfriend but still if you’re going to make a show around college aged people then make them look that age at least.  However despite not finding him very satisfactory as a leading man he does tend to man up at the key times and grow during the course of the story.<br />
<br />
Belldandy is basically your perfect Japanese girlfriend/wife.  She’s moe for starters though not to the degree that we see in today’s anime.  She’s beautiful, a perfect cook and homemaker, and great at school.  Though the revelation of her attending school with Keiichi was a bit confusing since they just suddenly dropped that on the audience without any real explanation.  That’s another issue I have with Belldandy.  Of course I loved her, who wouldn’t?  But she lives for Keiichi and everything she thinks of and does is only for him.  There seems to be no will or drive of her own.  I know this anime is intended for guys, but well I think guys need to see things that are more realistic as well.  We don’t live to serve you; a relationship should be a partnership.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast is pretty small and of the supporting cast there are some memorable characters.  Frankly Urd and Skuld steal the show and are much more interesting characters than either of the leads.  I thought they complimented each other nicely, with each being very different personalities.  Additionally I was pleasantly surprised that as they grew into the harem of pretty girls surrounding Keiichi they didn’t try to become love interests.  Keiichi&#039;s sister Megumi had some early promise but she faded from the story pretty quickly.  Most of the rest of the characters are forgettable and don’t get much screen time.<br />
<br />
The artwork and animation quality is very good.  You would honestly never know that it was made in the early 90s without being told so.  The characters are very detailed and realistic looking.  My only issue with the characters would be the much to youthful look for Keiichi.  This is a minor annoyance though.  The magic and special effects are well done as well whenever one of the Goddesses uses her powers.<br />
<br />
The voice performances are the weakest link of the OVA.  Keiichi&#039;s weakness is brought home by his un-masculine voice.  Also Belldandy&#039;s voice is a bit irritating on the nerves too.  While I have enjoyed Kikuko Inoue&#039;s roles before there is just something I don’t like about the way she voiced this character.  Again Urd and Skuld steal the spotlight in the category as well.  The OP/EN music were good however and fitting.<br />
<br />
I was pleasantly surprised by my enjoyment of Ah! My Goddess.  If you’re looking for a little light romance that is high on sweetness with a dash of comedy and very little perversion then I would recommend this series to you.<br />

    How can there not be a review for this yet? Must be because this is the forgotten child of the franchise. With the manga and tv series all being far more popular and fleshed out, its easy to overlook the OVA here. But to ignore it completely is a mistake. The OVA episodes here are without a doubt a re-telling of the same AMG story we&#039;ve come to know and enjoy over the years....but there are a few mildly interesting discrepancies.<br />
<br />
So lets get down to it. You got Keiichi, Belldandy, and the rest of the gang. In fact, all the main characters show up with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review12556">
        the exception of Marller. You got the &#039;sittin-at-home-waitin-for-a-phone-call-and-oh-shi-its-a-babe-in-the-window&#039; inciting incident. After a little fast forwarding they get their temple house set up and then everyone begins to make their entrances.<br />
<br />
This is where the aforementioned discrepancies begin. Sayoko and Belldandy meet on a beach five months later instead of at the university. In the same episode they pull the love potion Keiichi, Sayoko, and Belldandy story while switching out Marller for Urd as the antagonist of that situation. If that weren&#039;t strange enough, the third episode has them drag racing against Toshimas club for a bet that apparently be one-sided here.<br />
<br />
But its in the fourth episode where the story really breaks down. There is some kinda crazy that keeps Belldandy and Keeichi from being near one another. Whats worse is that Belldandy has to go back to the Heavens in three days time and probably won&#039;t be coming back any time soon. The source of all their problems? Some goofing looking tree that has a connection to both Keiichi and Belldandys childhoods. Hmmmm, I&#039;m sure I don&#039;t remember any of this in the rest of the franchise. <br />
<br />
But thats not all. They even took a couple chances on changing characters. Take Keiichi for example. He is usually very shy, gentle, and understanding. Here he is more courageous and confrontational. Belldandy is pretty much the same, though I would say her &quot;strong&quot; moments fell short, and Tamiya and Ootaki seemed to be dialed way down.<br />
<br />
As you can see, the OVA starts out as a missable re-tell, goes into a chopped up fast forward presentation, and finally evolves into a brand new story all its own. The names and setting remained the same, but the events and even the characters changed at least a bit. <br />
<br />
So if you&#039;ve skipped this in the past, re-think it. If you&#039;re looking for a different twist to the AMG series, check it out. The only thing you have to lose is about 2 and a half hours.<br />

    This first OVA really tried it&#039;s finest to capture the feel of the manga. Light-hearted and very emotional.<br />
<br />
Compared to the new adaptations.<br />
Positive:<br />
+ Belldandy doesn&#039;t behave like the perfect Mary Sue or is naive.<br />
+ The romance is much more intense.<br />
+ Belldandy really looks more attractive in some scenes than the new design.<br />
+ Opening (sung by the voice actors!!!)<br />
<br />
Negative:<br />
- There are large gaps between OVAs. If you don&#039;t know the manga or haven&#039;t looked at the newer adaptations, you can quickly lose the orientation.<br />
- In general, the image quality is worse (with a few exceptions as mentioned above.<br />
- There are no humor or jokes like in the

    I watched this cos it was short. Can&#039;t say I was expecting much from it, and was pleasantly surprised as a result. This was in more ways than one the feel of this is similar to &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot; (the female leads are even voiced by the same actress). However, I thought &quot;Onegai teacher&quot; was a horrible anime... so how did this succeed where Onegai Teacher didn&#039;t, especially given the title of this was enough to make me cringe?<br />
<br />
Is it the animation? The animation for AMG (&quot;Ah! My Goddess&quot;) is only so-so, not as good as Onegai Teacher. The colours are a bit stale and though

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23991">
        I wouldn&#039;t go as far as to say it looks dated, it&#039;s obvious that it isn&#039;t a recent anime. Also, Belldandy didn&#039;t look as stunning all the characters makes her out to be. :P<br />
<br />
The sound? I REALLY liked the music in this one... the end theme is just so catchy and charming. In hindsight, it probably did a lot to tame my attitude towards AMG. The only bit that was slightly off was the music being played during the climax in the last episode. It was a tad over dramatic, and would have been more suitable in a mecha battle or something. Other than that, I loved the music. Did I mention that I especially liked the end theme? Oh well, it&#039;s so good it deserves another mention :P  Even though I thought the voice acting was a little on the weak side, the sound department certainly went a long way towards making this a decent anime.<br />
<br />
The story... as you might expect from someone who thought the Onegai Teacher&#039;s story was ludicrous, I thought the story for AMG was ludicrous too, and it was definitely the weakest part of this anime. But for some reason AMG seemed a lot less so than Onegai teacher. It felt like it was flowed much better. Maybe it is because of the characters - I felt the characters in AMG were much better portrayed. Initially, I thought it was a little weird how Belldandy just took to the guy so easily, but as it went on, I actually found the relationship between the two main characters to be a lot more natural than in &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot;. And what&#039;s more, I actually cared a bit about what happened to the main character in this. So this is another one of the major factors that lifts this far above &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot;.<br />
<br />
AMG is far from being great, but I would describe it as a NICE anime, one of those that make you go &quot;awww&quot;. It turned out to be pretty decent, and considering how I tend to hate anime from this genre, this is pretty high praise.

    The OVA from the Ah! My Goddess series. This OVA is obviously old but still very good.<br />
<br />
Story: The first three episodes are pretty much the same as the beginning of the 2005 series with a few minor differences. After that the story takes on it&#039;s on twist of the series. The ending is rather confusing and I had no idea what was happening exactly.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Obivously older. The art is definitely not as good as the 2005 series, but I guess it&#039;s not the worst art in the world. The animation also was not up to my standards, but it was still decent enough to watch.<br />
<br />
Sound: The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15051">
        opening and ending themes were nice to listen to, but not amazing. I don&#039;t remember if there was background music, but if there was it was unmemorable. The voice cast did an excellent job though :)<br />
<br />
Character: Likeable, but not very developed as it is only a 5 episode series. You don&#039;t really get a full feel of the character unless you&#039;ve previously seen Ah! My Goddess.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Kinda bored. 30 minutes each per episode can kinda be boring. But all in all I liked it.<br />
<br />
Overall: The story was very good. The art could&#039;ve used some work and so could the sound. This series should&#039;ve been made into a longer OVA so that the characters could be developed further as this anime is all about the characters. But I still really enjoyed this.

    If you have watched Ah! My goddess tv series first before this short OVA just like me, you may think that this is a cheap recap of the series and this ova is nothing compared to it. but that&#039;s because this OVA is the original one  who brings the best of the ah! Goddess tv series also followed with some animes that presumably has the same plot line.<br />
<br />
8/10<br />
Story:<br />
Ah! my goddess one of the best of 1990&#039;s anime that has fine romance in it, it’s about an average boy who accidentally meet a beautiful girl and live together (pretty much of a cliché right) but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34906">
        the story has some twist that gave the story a great 8.<br />
8/10<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Belldandy’s character compliment the story in here she being the goddess is perfectly describe in the story add it up to her angelic voice and a character that you will rarely see in just  any other characters, keichi’s character here is a bit aggressive for an average boy, Skuld and urd their character brings a comedic pair in this OVA.<br />

     Minor Spoilers.<br />
<br />
Ah My Goddess is simply put one of the most endearing and heart-warming romantic anime that I&#039;ve ever watched.<br />
<br />
Ah My Goddesses focuses on the tale of Keichi who lives a relatively mundane college life and everything in his life is turned upside down when a desire to order food at his dormitory makes him dial a wrong number which connects him to the Goddess Hotline which brings a Goddess into his life by the name of Belldandy. This beautiful goddess tells him that he can have one wish that she will do everything in her power to make it come true. Despite Keichi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258238">
        being skeptical towards the events that have just happened he wishes for the goddess to be with him forever and much to his surprise she grants him that wish. Ever since that day his life has never been the same.<br />
<br />
This anime would be mostly categorized as a romantic anime with some magical girl elements but the biggest thing I can praise this anime for is that despite its short length it really goes above and beyond to make you care for the two main characters in this series which is Keichi and Belldandy.<br />
<br />
I can understand why a lot of old school anime fans have a lot of fondness for Belldandy because for as much as she is a beautifully drawn character, she has such a warm and endearing personality without being labelled as naive or airheaded. She is very loving and innocent person that always believes in doing things for the right reason and thankfully she is not sexualized in this anime as far as I&#039;m concerned minus a few slight scenes of fan-service that isn&#039;t a detriment to overall character development of this character. Her development is also strengthened by a respectful male lead that could of easily taken advantage of her and the situation he is in, but his morals won&#039;t allow him to because he does ultimately care about her and throughout the series we will easily see how much he is willing to endure to care about the woman he is learning and willing to love.<br />
<br />
Despite this anime being made in the early 1990&#039;s, the artwork for this anime is incredibly beautiful and the designs for the goddesses are incredibly detailed.The music fits the series incredibly well because when the anime wants to be heartfelt and cheerful the music accommodates for that and when the anime wants to be sad and depressing it has music that accommodates that as well. I want to highlight the ending song of this anime because it is incredibly adorable and really encompasses the entire aura of what makes this show so endearing.<br />
<br />
Despite this OVA only being 5 episodes, it really does a lot in those 5 episodes. The first 3 episodes have a more happier and carefree vibe while the last two episodes are very sad and somber but all 5 episodes are used to strengthen the relationship between Keichi and Belldandy without becoming overbearing and painful.<br />
<br />
Besides the two main characters other characters are brought into this anime, most notably Belldandy&#039;s goddess sisters (Older Sister Urd and Younger Sister Skuld) who definitely add some comedy to this romantic anime. Urd constantly pressures Keichi to grow some courage to tell Belldandy how he truly feels because Keichi is constantly at conflict with himself because even though he has a beautiful girl in his life, he struggles to know if its genuine or not because there are times he thinks she is only there because of the wish she granted him or if she really does have feelings for him. Skuld on the other hand is a very clingy younger sister that misses Belldandy in the Goddess world and thinks Keichi is at fault of why she doesn&#039;t return to the goddess world so that she can have Belldandy for herself. There are other characters in the anime but they have very minor roles and unfortunately are easily forgettable.<br />
<br />
Ultimately the overall plot fixates on the concept of forbidden love because we have two characters (a human and a goddess) that under normal circumstances would never work and it becomes apparent that close to the end of the anime Keichi may lose Belldandy forever. When this anime builds towards it conclusion he is going to do everything in his power to enjoy his time left with Belldandy because he learns that his relationship with her is causing problems in the real world.<br />
<br />
While people may get offended at the beginning that this relationship only exists because of making a wish come true, it ends up being a lot more complicated than that. No meaningful relationship should ever be formed by a forced contract, but we ultimately learn throughout this short ova is that if two people are meant to be together, they will find a way to be together regardless if its through a contract or not. Promises can go a long way after all especially if two people have feelings for each other even if they don&#039;t know it yet.<br />
<br />
Overall, this is a very heartfelt comical anime that hits your feelings in all the right ways and by the end of it you&#039;ll be happy that you watched it because it deserves its praise as a well respected timeless romantic anime.<br />
<br />
This makes me excited to watch the other iterations of Ah My Goddess.<br />

8/10<br />

    Story 7/10<br />
<br />
The story is about a boy named Morisato Keiichi, who accidentally called the Goddess Hotline and receives an unexpected visit from a goddess Belldandy asking to grant his wish. He wishes that a girl like Belldandy would stay with him forever. It&#039;s a good story but short since it&#039;s only 5 episodes. Time seems to pass quickly between each episode without telling you but that&#039;s alright. It&#039;s pretty good, so a seven.<br />
<br />
Art 8/10<br />
<br />
For the early 90s the art was really good. You can&#039;t tell that it was made in that time without someone telling you. It&#039;s not absolutely perfect, but it was pretty great.<br />
<br />
Sound

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33662">
        7/10<br />
<br />
Keiichi and Belldandy&#039;s voices weren&#039;t all that great but Urd&#039;s and Skuld&#039;s were pretty good. The opening and ending songs were very fitting. It was all pretty good but a weak point in this OVA so a seven.<br />
<br />
Character 8/10<br />
<br />
The characters were okay, Belldandy seemed a little nervous and full of worries and sometimes a little out there. Urd was relaxed and carefree which fit her well, Skuld was kind of annoying sometimes, and Keiichi was typical uncool guy.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9/10<br />
<br />
Even though some things were a little iffy at times, it all connected to make the show enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Overall 8/10

    I always wanted to watch or read the Ah! My Goddess story since i got a copy of Vol.3 of the manga. I got the chance to watch the 1st screen adaptation,the 1993 OVA this last weekend and then to conclude this adaptation i watched too the 2000 film,a sequel to the OVA.<br />
Ok people,1st of all,a screen or big screen adaptation don&#039;t need to be totally faithful to their novel/manga counterparts. I read Bram Stoker&#039;s Dracula and,Coppola&#039;s movie adaptation have some differences but was terrific,though. The Rurouni Kenshin anime adaptation are a bit different from the manga as well but i don&#039;t care,was fantastic and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review91123">
        a complete adaptation or at least a complete loosely based adaptation guys!<br />
But sadly the 1993 OVA of Ah! My Goddess didn&#039;t got the same treatment.<br />
If you watch the opening credits of the OVA you can see Banpei,the robot created by Skuld and other characters from the manga,but Banpei is not introduced in the OVA neither other characters revealed on the credits as well,so the excuse that some people give to us that at that time the manga was in the 1st steps can&#039;t work here if they had a cameo on the opening sequence! Then on the 2000 film,Banpei appears at the beginning,when Keiichi asks if he saw Belldandy. (SPOILER ALERT) -_-&#039;<br />
I don&#039;t know how this works for you guys,but a good screen or big screen adaptation can&#039;t work just with a terrific soundtrack or beautiful design/graphics,it needs a good script too. The manga is still in progress,so,there isn&#039;t a complete anime adaptation of Ah! My Goddess yet,but the more accurate adaptation is the Tv counterpart in my opinion. Faithful or loosely based it&#039;s the best choice in my most sincere opinion. Don&#039;t waste your time w/ this OVA,skip to the TV series and wait for the &quot;probably&quot; upcoming episodes to it. I don&#039;t want to piss off the fans that loved the OVA,i am a big fan of Ah! My Goddess too and they need to have their profit as well,but i can&#039;t stand when they release senseless movies or episodes just because it sells.

    This is the &quot;original&quot; and first Anime based on Kousuke Fujishima&#039;s &quot;Aa! Megami-sama!&quot; (Oh! My Goddess)  Manga, produced in 1993; only roughly 6 years after the first Manga release. It was originally sold on home video directly to customers; the target market would largely have been fans of the extant Manga. This series is only 5 episodes, all running around 30 minutes. However it is formatted like it would be if it were to actually be broadcast, including a mid-show &quot;break&quot; with an eye-catch (many direct-to-video OAVs of the era were designed that way both for fun and in case the videos were ever

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301353">
        picked up for broadcast).<br />
<br />
Having been produced in the early 90&#039;s, this is Anime in its original ink-and-paint form. Here that medium is used deftly, setting the tone in a way you rarely see in digital animation. Many of the background paintings are soft watercolors or vibrant – yet washed out. While some backgrounds are stronger, depending on the scene, on the whole this gives the Anime a soft texture, underscoring its whimsical romantic-comedy structure. As with many OAV of this era, the artwork on the cell animation is exemplary, as these kinds of OAV typically had limited budgets but were not quite  as production-time constrained and as such, what was produced was of general higher quality than what you&#039;d see in a TV production run. The lush detailing of the cell animation is proof of this, and is fairly uniform throughout. In fact, for me, coming back to this Anime is like re-watching a dream. Not just from the soft watercolor backgrounds and the now gone cell animation styles. More so because the manga was originally created in the late 80&#039;s and many sets and technology objects rendered into the Anime are increasingly anachronistic, but familiar to some of us who grew up in that era (as I did). For example the rotary land-line phone in the Nekomi Tech dorm (including its 10-yen coin slot) is decidedly foreign to many in our post-landline mobile smart-phone world today. Other subtle objects like the apparently miniature (but not really for its era) CRT television with channel dials, or the computer Skuld uses. There are probably other details only the Japanese would pick up, probably with dress, hairstyles, and the general nature of the college students (like the Auto Club) which are probably sorely outdated now.<br />
<br />
As to the story, as was also typical of this era of OAVs, it&#039;s adapted from the Manga but doesn&#039;t hew to it exactly. It also skips a bit in terms of chronology, due in no small part to the limited production and the need to put together something cohesive and satisfying. Remember most consumers buying this would have already read the Manga (so fans would fill in the blanks around the enjoyment of seeing key scenes in animation) or were to be inspired to do so by watching it (if you like the Anime, read the Manga!). Therefore the goal was never to &quot;animate the manga succinctly&quot;. Indeed, often non-manga-canon alternate scenarios were done in OAVs as much to explore the characters and story in a new and exciting way as it was a method of ensuring the OAV could end satisfyingly without rushing through a long Manga plot (without doing it justice). Of course, it also gave the Manga fans yet another incentive to purchase it if there was new content that wasn’t in the Manga. So be thankful for all the manga and light novels that get turned into 12-13 episode half-seasons today, even if that&#039;s all you get. In the past, often all we got were a few (albeit really fun) episodes direct-to-video &quot;back in the day&quot; like this with years (or never!) before seeing anything else get animated.<br />
 <br />
In any case, with this OAV we do get a number of requisite scenes which really aren&#039;t spoilers here; Belldandy&#039;s arrival and Keiichi&#039;s wish; their move into the Tariki-hongan temple, Megumi&#039;s appearance, the Auto Club and the Senpais, Urd&#039;s appearance (which is simultaneously wonderfully hilarious and embarrassingly sultry), Skuld&#039;s appearance, and a few scenes with both Sayoko and Aoshima as antagonists. There are also a number of supernatural elements in the story utilizing some pretty impressive-for-their-time analog lighting effects.<br />
<br />
However, it must be said, the later television series and its related specials and OAV which began in 2005, cover all the major elements shown in this OAV; most of it in the first 12 or so episodes of the first 2005 TV season and most of the rest in the second 2006 TV season. Therefore, in terms of a &quot;sequential Anime marathon&quot; this OAV is rendered obsolete. Thus it is best taken on its own, for its own sake and qualities. I often, personally either watch it just before or just after completing a re-watch of all the other Oh! My Goddess! Anime. However, because it doesn&#039;t tend to precipitate into hours of re-watching the whole Anime canon, it&#039;s also fun as a one-off...like if you get the hankering for a little SoL RomCom on a rainy Sunday afternoon. It&#039;s a little old but a lot charming, and definitely a fun little distraction, which is why it’s consistently remained high on my list since the time when I was a poor college student, much like Keiichi.<br />

    Wonderful adaptation of the manga with well-realized main characters and fantastic visual &amp; sound design. The chief problem lies in the fact that at 5 episodes this OVA barely has time to cover the principal characters and give passing notice to a few supporting characters before the climactic wrap-up in the final couple of episodes. Some supporting characters don&#039;t even get mentioned or seen, but considering that this OVA was made early in the manga run this makes sense. Fast forward a decade and the series saw a proper long-form TV adaptation, incorporating several manga story arcs. And although open-ended, did manage to feel complete

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294409">
        when taken in full with the Fighting Wings OVA &amp; especially the AMG movie from a few years before, which used similar plot elements which later surfaced in the concluding chapters of the manga. Still in terms of visual and sound design, the series has aged remarkably well, even if the truncated narrative felt rushed due to the rather short run of the OVA.

    For my final review of 2017, I shall review Oh My Goddess!, the OVA anime. This anime version is a 5 episode OVA from 1993 that is loosely based on the long running successful manga by Kosuke Fujishima. Usually short OVAs are not much and don&#039;t contain much for character development, but this is a rare exception? Why? Well, let&#039;s delve deep into here and see why this anime OVA is a classic and favorite among many:<br />
<br />
Story (9/10): One day in a college dorm, a student named Keiichi Morisato calls on the phone to get some takeout for lunch, but accidentally dials the Goddess Technical

          <span style="display: none;" id="review267058">
        Help Line and is visited by a goddess from heaven herself called Belldandy, who is there to grant him a single wish. Keiichi, who&#039;s never been successful at getting a girlfriend, wishes that Belldandy could stay with him forever and it is granted. After being kicked out of the male only dorm, Keiichi and Belldandy begin a series of events where they find a place to live, try to help each other out, meet Urd and Skuld, two other goddesses who are sisters to Belldandy, and when Belldandy receives a call from the Almighty himself, the two discover that their relationship may be more than they thought it would be...<br />
<br />
While I am currently reading the manga and am not finished with it yet (I may update when I finish it), I will say this: this version is not accurate to the manga at all when comparing it (certain characters don&#039;t appear in the second chapter and events in the last two episodes are original to this OVA), but that doesn&#039;t mean that it&#039;s bad at all. The writers were able to do their own interpretation of the love story of Keiichi and Belldandy  actually make it work in two hours time, and have a satisfying conclusion, something that some other OVAs I&#039;ve seen have failed to do.<br />
<br />
What also makes this story work is the balance between the romantic, drama and comedy elements. Even though this is only two hours long, the romance felt between our two leads feels very genuine and realistic, their relationship grows easily over the course of the five episodes and in the end you can truly feel that it was earned. The comedy is also hilarious, relying on fanservice but also some slapstick here and there. The dramatic parts shine especially well in the last two episodes where the show successfully manages to shift from comedy to drama without effecting it in a bad way, unlike shows like Voogie&#039;s Angel, you might need the tissue box at the end.<br />
<br />
It does have flaws though. The aforementioned fanservice part of the comedy may turn some viewers off, and some of the problems Belldandy and Keiichi deal with may only seem minor or stuff you may see in other romantic stories, and some people familiar with the manga may complain about it not being too faithful but whatever good this series has, far, far, far outweighs the flaw.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation (9/10): AIC, or Anime International Corporation, mostly has great, if not good looking anime in their library, and this is one of their best looking ones yet. The art and animation are absolutely beautiful for a 1993 anime and OVA; all of the characters are very well drawn, the clothes the goddesses wear are imaginatively lovely, there&#039;s lots of bright colors in the background and characters, the backgrounds look full of life and easy on the eyes, and the animation for the majority of the time is fluid and smooth. The comedic expressions aren&#039;t as hilarious as Fujishima&#039;s art, but they still do their job very well. Belldandy and Urd look attractive and ravishing (Urd especially looks sexy), Skuld looks adorkable and cute, and a lot of the minor characters like Keiichi&#039;s dorm-mates all look unique and you can tell every character in here has their own personality to them based on their looks, no two characters here look the same. I will admit though, I did funnily think that Aoshima looked like Harry Potter (sans the scar) if he were an anime character. The only minor nitpick I have with the art is that some of the sunny backgrounds have a lot of white in them to the point where they look unfinished or not colored in completely, but other than that this anime is one of the best to look at, I&#039;d even hang a still frame of some of them on my wall. The endings are also all unique as they all have their own animations to them, I liked the ending animation with the super deformed/chibi versions of them best.<br />
<br />
In terms of fan service and such, there is a good amount, mostly in the second episode; Urd is seen posing in a sensual way when she first appears and has a skimpy swimsuit and cheerleader outfit in the third episode, and Belldandy is shown nude briefly when transforming into her goddess form in the final episode, but it&#039;s no worse than a naked Barbie.<br />
<br />
Sound (8/10): The voice acting is spectacular in this anime. Kikuko Inoue (Reika from Battle Skipper, Shiori from Voogie&#039;s Angel, Sailor Aluminum Siren from Sailor Moon Sailor Stars) practically IS Belldandy, she gives the goddess a lovely, sweet, angelic, maternal, practically perfect voice that is so beautiful and makes one charmed by her. I don&#039;t understand why some people think it isn&#039;t that great, this really is one of her best roles. Masami Kikuchi captures Keiichi&#039;s silly, but kind, friendly nature very well. Yumi Touma (Kisenian Flower from Sailor Moon R movie, Reiko Takagi from Graduation, Marriage and Sailor Victory) is perfectly cast as Urd, giving the second-class goddess a sultry, passionate voice that fits her character. Aya Hisakawa (Ami Mizuno/Sailor Mercury from the Sailor Moon franchise, Voogie from Voogie&#039;s Angel, Lisa from Bubblegum Crisis) captures Skuld&#039;s childish, bratty, yet likable characteristic. Other highlights of the cast are Junko Asami as Sayako, and Nobou Tobia (Kamille from Zeta Gundam) as Aoshima. All of the VAs in the Japanese versions are excellent, well cast and do a great job delivering their lines and becoming the characters they play as.<br />
<br />
I have not seen the English dub, but will update when I do. I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s actually good.<br />
<br />
The opening and ending themes are excellent, being performed by the VAs of the three goddesses, but unfortunately the rest of the music is sadly forgettable. It isn&#039;t bad, but not particularly memorable.<br />
<br />
Character (8/10): The characters are where this anime also shines through, a lot of the characters, while they may seem stereotypical or just tropes, are more than just that, they all have their own unique personalities, grow over the course of this OVA and are mostly likable. Belldandy lives up to being a kind goddess, she is very kind, sweet, and caring for Keiichi, doing her best to help him out and be happy no matter what happens. She could be seen as too perfect by some people, but it&#039;s not in a horrible, bad way; she proves why she is such a lovable character and displays so much positive qualities and energy she&#039;s earned it. Keiichi may be clumsy and isn&#039;t always perfect, but he too tries to make sure Belldandy is always happy and shows that he loves her too. Urd (who in the manga tried to seduce Keiichi when she first met him) is impulsive and tries to come up with plans that don&#039;t usually succeed and meddles with things, but it&#039;s usually with good intentions and though she does anger easily she does soften up near the end. Skuld&#039;s dislike of Keiichi, childishness and clingy nature may annoy some people but I still found her funny and to be fair, she is a child and children tend to act out if they&#039;re feeling alone and she acts more caring towards Keiichi . She is basically the tech member of the goddesses, building inventions and using technology (kinda like Mercury). For some of the minor characters, Megumi, Keiichi&#039;s little sister, does act like a typical little sister but isn&#039;t as childish as Skuld is. Sayako is jealous of Belldandy, loving Keiichi himself but does change a bit towards the end, Aoshima is the typical cocky rival, and even Keiichi&#039;s dormmates are goofy, not the brightest bulbs but still likable, even after they kick him out of the dorm.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately some characters you see in the opening (the girl with the blond hair and Sora, the girl with the short brown hair and glasses) either don&#039;t appear in the OVA or have more minor roles<br />
<br />
Overall (9/10): This has become one of my favorite anime series and makes me glad I discovered this amazing romantic slice-of-life comedy. The story is romantic and charming, the art/animation are wonderful, the characters are charming, funny, and sweet, it doesn&#039;t overstay its welcome and you don&#039;t even have to read the manga in order to watch this great anime, it is another perfect way to introduce you to this story. If you want a great classic anime series, like anime with magical goddesses, romance, slice of life, comedy, or any of those, check this one out, you don&#039;t wanna miss out. If that&#039;s not the case, then stay away.<br />
<br />
Now to check out the movie and hope, or in this case, pray, that it will be great...

    Aa! Megami-sama! or Oh! My Goddess is a 5 episode OVA series that released from Feb 21 1993 to May 17 1994. It&#039;s an adaptation of Kousuke Fujishima&#039;s manga of the same name. It was produced by studio AIC and directed by Hiroaki Gohda.<br />
<br />
The story follows Keiichi Morisato. He&#039;s a college student who&#039;s been left alone in the dorms as his friends have gone out. He ends up dialing the wrong number as he&#039;s trying to order some takeout and ends up summoning a beautiful goddess named Belldandy. She promises to grant Keiichi any wish he has, and he wishes for her to stay by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266883">
        his side forever. Because of this, Keiichi gets kicked out of the mens only dormitory and ends up moving out to an old shrine, where more goddesses and other people show up to get involved in his love life.<br />
<br />
Keiichi Morisato is a normal college student and our main character. He has no luck with women because he is short, but somehow ends up getting a beautiful goddess as a girlfriend. He&#039;s also a part of his college&#039;s racing club.<br />
<br />
Belldandy is the goddess who first visits Keiichi and makes the contract with him to stay with him forever. She is kind, warm, beautiful and makes a lot of heads turn. She&#039;s also really good at cooking.<br />
<br />
Urd is the second goddess that shows up. She&#039;s the cupid of love and she is also Belldandy&#039;s older sister. She comes down to earth in order to help close the distance betwee Keiichi and Belldandy and get them further in their relationship, although it mostly ends in failure.<br />
<br />
Skuld is the third goddess to appears in this OVA. She is Belldandy&#039;s younger sister and has come to bring her back to heaven. She does not like Keiichi and wants to try to seperate him and Belldandy.<br />
<br />
The animation and visuals in this OVA is nothing to write home about. For the most part I would even say that it&#039;s kinda poor. There is a lack of concistency in the designs and characters proportions, even when it&#039;s not moving, and the animation itself is very basic. Not that there is anything wrong with basic animation, but it is also not impressing anyone.<br />
<br />
The music in this OVA is also not that great. It feels like it always overpowers whatever is going on. Like in a lot of the dramatic scenes. It&#039;s usually very light drama, but the music seems to want you to think that the world is ending tomorrow. It&#039;s very off-putting to say the least.<br />
<br />
Despite these flaws, I have to say that I enjoyed this OVA. It was very short and sweet, but it didn&#039;t stick around on pointless moments, and got on with it and let you experience a lot of what happened between the characters, making the bonds between them feel more real. Sure, it could have been a few episodes longer so as to avoid some of those pretty huge timeskips, but it didn&#039;t really bother me that much. I really enjoyed the characters, and none of them got on my nerves. That in itself is a pretty good feat, cause I always tend to find at least one character that annoys me. Overall it was a short and sweet OVA that I enjoyed watching. I would recommend people check this out. It&#039;s only 5 episodes at 35 - 30 mins each, so it&#039;s not a huge investment either.

    (love) Ah! my goddess! is one of the greatest anime i have seen. two thing i value most in an anime is one the strength of the main characters idea of right and and wrong two the strength of the connection between the main character and the girl he ends up with. This anime showed the second one in almost everything that occurred. i found that out of all the anime i have seen this one showed the love of the main characters the most and in a way no other anime could even compare. <br />
<br />
(war)Ah! my goddess!, in conjunction with the dilemmas of love

    Mehh<br />

Keiichi meets the Goddess Belldandy and asks her to stay at his side forever... So where do you go from there? This is a very cheerful and comedic anime with a bit of drama in every episode to keep things interesting. <br />
<br />
Honestly the first episode failed to impress me because Keichii is your typical wimpy male protagonist who is easily shocked about everything and Belldandy is your lovely soft anime waifu who never gets angry about anything. It does get better in episode 2 though, more comedy, more drama, the characters experience growth and mature over each episode and become more relatable as a couple

          <span style="display: none;" id="review382495">
        with the challenges they face, like a being harassed by bullies/haters, jealous sisters and things like that though it does feel like an eternity for anything to happen between Keiichi and Bell.<br />
<br />
Belldandy&#039;s sisters, Urk and the other whose name I forgot are also part of the story and are quite likeable at first but you&#039;ll soon realize that their only purpose is to either make or break the relationship of Keichii and Bell. After their own character specific episode ends they become stale DBZ side characters where they really don&#039;t matter much to the plot anymore other than to be around the MCs. What&#039;s even worse is that they even lose a bit of the personality that made them so unique, they all become these generic caring and supportive side characters with no goals or real reason to be there.<br />
<br />
The story starts simple enough but the final episode adds a twist that kinda ruins everything and the ending is unsatisfying. The art style is very 90&#039;s, nice to look at but for some reason each episode looks worse than the previous one.<br />
<br />
The last episode looks absolutely awful, characters like Urk that used to look beautiful and hot look less detailed and rushed like the production team was on a very tight budget or something. The music isn&#039;t memorable.<br />
<br />
Overal, the show had potential but it was wasted by not taking it&#039;s time to develop it&#039;s characters more and keep them consistent. Also the story gets convoluted for no reason it should&#039;ve kept it simple.
