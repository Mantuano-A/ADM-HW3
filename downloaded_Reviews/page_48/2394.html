    *One step at a time, slowly they find themselves falling in love.*<br />
<br />
“Geez, women are so hard to understand” – Etsu Kusuda<br />
<br />
Most, if not all male viewers tend to agree with that statement. The various male characters in Hatsukoi Limited (literally means first love limited) all experienced the same problem. But before you get the wrong idea, it should mentioned that this anime is directed from the female perspective most of the time. Hatsukoi Limited explores the early love life of a group of teenage girls and how they cope with boys that they like (or don’t like). While 12 episodes are hardly enough to cover

          <span style="display: none;" id="review16236">
        any in depth relationship for over half a dozen girls, the story remains a highly enjoyable one. Simply put, Hatsukoi Limited is as close to an idealized slice of life / romance comedy one could find in the market now a day.<br />
<br />
Complex love web is one of the main elements in the story. However, viewers will have no trouble adapting to the environment as everything build on one another slowly one step at a time. In fact, the overall plot to the story tags along quite well with each major character’s development. One could even say the characters are a natural complement to the story or vice versa (this may be a natural thing to say, but in reality not a lot of shows can even do this properly).<br />
<br />
A well structured story must also have a logical order for presenting its characters and Hatsukoi Limited excel in this department as well, as previously mentioned. What most people worry about is the sudden rush of information in the early episodes (like just dumping all you need to know about all the characters in episode 1), but thankfully that is not the case for Hatsukoi Limited. In hindsight, starting the story with Ayumi was an obvious choice for the author although her character as a whole may not have been the easiest to accept by most audiences. <br />
<br />
Viewers will enjoy watching most of the characters grow and develop themselves along the way. Most have gotten more mature and act more reasonably, but there are some exceptions. Whether the lack of character development for these characters are attributed to the length of the series or the story was meant to be that way, is up to viewers to decide. However, it should be pointed out that all the characters have a sense of realism in them, nothing from their characteristics seem fictitious or too fantasy-like. Through the eyes of these 14 to 16 years old, one might even see a resemblance of your own younger self.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the most painful part of Hatsukoi Limited with regards to its characters is that, like most shounen shows out there, it has really wimpy, stupid, and annoying guys (to make matter worse, most of them look quite ugly too). On the other hand, the females characters are often really smart, kawaii, and gorgeous looking babes (yes Misaki, that means you)!<br />
<br />
Quite frankly, it was the character animation that first caught my attention to this wonderful romance comedy as the storyline sounded rather generic to me at first. As to be expect from J.C. Staff, they always deliver high quality animation (and consistent too). The backgrounds are often lacking in detail, but that help put the characters in focus and viewers will spend 90% of the time looking at the characters anyway, thus there isn’t much to complain about. It was also interesting to see that the characters in the anime seem to be an exact carbon copy of their original manga self. Believe it or not, it is not easy to find an anime adaptation that follows the manga as closely as Hatsukoi Limited, both in the looks of the characters and the story itself.<br />
<br />
Finally, music is THE area that surpirsed me the most throughout the show. First off, both OP and ED are just splendid. The additional BGM and soundtracks in between just amplifies whatever tiny emotion I had in my mind, making this series a bit more successful than it should have been in my eyes. I hope you will find Hatsukoi Limited as enjoyable as it did for me and it is definitely a series in which I plan to have a blu-ray collection of in the future.<br />
<br />
Are you in love right now?

    Hatsukoi limited follows the lives of a group of teenagers from a few schools that are connected in some way or another. It covers the early part of their love lives and deals solely with the issue of love. So for those who enjoy school romance you will probably enjoy this series.<br />
<br />
The story i gave a 10 because it was clique but at the same time original at some points. While it&#039;s about a typical school romance it involves many characters that shape the story differently from a usual school romance. We get to see all sorts of love which is why i really enjoyed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review18945">
        the series. From unrequitted to mutual to family. All are touched upon. The story can be said to be quite light hearted as it involves a lot of humour, but it is not too slapstick and it does have its serious moments which make the story entetaining. I think what i enjoyed most was the realism in the story in that it&#039;s not always a happy ending but it still gives us the feeling that it is in its own way because of the way the characters feel or get out of the experiences. I also found it interesting how the story intertwines the characters such that there is always some relation to another character and we go like &quot;what a development! so complex!&quot;. <br />
<br />
The art was appropriate for the series. The characters were drawn out vividly and colourful which suits the light heartednes of the story. The humour came out quite nicely as well as it&#039;s not like those blank face drawings you get in the more humourous animes and the scenery is done up quite nicely as well so 9 for art.<br />
<br />
The sound i gave an 8 because in relation to other animes i have seen it cannot match up to the wide selection that they give. But nonetheless, there were several endings used in different episodes that helped to bring out the mood at the end of the episode. Personally i felt the ending song was a more appropriate for this anime than the starting. So all in all an 8, because i think that it has potential for more.<br />
<br />
The characters were fantastic. I would give this anime a high9 which rounds off to 10. Considering the length of the anime, i think that the characters were given decent coverage and there is depth to most of the main characters. the only one who has little depth would be enomoto&#039;s sister whose love life was not covered. The story is really character-driven in that we get to see the story from many different angles depending on whose love life it is focussed on in each episode. Of course the main characters is still Ayumi but we get to see different points of view on love based on the different characters. This is what makes the story so colourful. Which is why i have to give both story and characters 10 as they go hand in hand. The characters have very real and different personalities which are explored in this story and help to make it intersting. I&#039;d say that almost all the characters are main characters because they get an equal coverage and hence it adds to the realism as it&#039;s not some anime where the main character always wins in the end.<br />
<br />
Overall, i think the anime was great in balancing the comedy and romance in the story. It can be said to be somewhat of a romantic comedy though there is no one focus. The episode length was actually quite adequate for this anime because of its ending which i will not spoil. For an anime of 12 episode, i must commend it for being one of the best i have seen in terms of character development and plot development. You will surely enjoy this series unless you are into more psychological or drama genres.

    Watched a few of these last night.<br />
<br />
So, what is this about?<br />
<br />
Middle school girls with bodies of able-bodied 20 year old women falling in love. Not with each other, or at least for now. It&#039;s all straight male-female puppy love first romance kitch. If you think you&#039;ve seen it before, you probably have. <br />
<br />
There is no twist, tho. There is no parallel universe. There are no giant robots. There are no dueling academies, aliens, spaceships, demons, futanari, or miko. There are also no harems, thankfully. What there is, is unrequited love, awkward moments, and lots of cameltoe, boob shots, and other ecchi scenarios with characters who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15367">
        look like adult women, but, um, aren&#039;t.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s all pretty bland with the familiar situations of unrequited love, lost love, nerdy boys, shy girls with big tits, brother-sister incest, that kind of stuff. The animation is top notch. The characters and backgrounds are beautiful, especially during the Christmas episode.<br />
<br />
But there are only a limited amount of times you can see a little girl drop kicking a big guy and laughing or two teenagers blushing about what to do next (put it in). <br />
<br />
And that probably got out of your system a decade ago, or more than a decade for me.  <br />
<br />
The girls aren&#039;t very personable, either. They&#039;re flat characters with little distinguishing factors, save for the ecchi conventions: shy girl with big tits (Meguru), brother complex girl (Koyoi), aloof ravenhair (Yamamoto), ditz (Arihara) etc. Each has their own &quot;unique&quot; design, but that just amounts to hair color and breast size, not personality.<br />
<br />
Strangely, the more engaging side arc was a love between Enomoto (a self-absorbed girl) who fell in love with a boy she called &quot;kappa (imp) face.&quot; It actually felt genuine for a while, but then it was nothing more than a teenage romance, and immature at best. Two people see in each other more than what&#039;s on the surface. We all do that, but so what?<br />
<br />
This is what happens when slice of life goes bad. The ecchi angle doesn&#039;t carry the series. There aren&#039;t any good story arcs. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s just a slice of someone&#039;s mediocre life. <br />
<br />
We&#039;ve all been there, but most of us have forgotten it, because it wasn&#039;t that memorable.

    Have you ever been in… love?<br />
<br />
Well that’s the pop up question in this anime. It’s about love affairs that can be ended to love struck.<br />
<br />
~Story~ [8]<br />
<br />
The stories between each of the characters are a bit specific, somewhat predictable and have the same issue. The issues bring a funny and interesting twist. We can call it a “love triangle or a misunderstanding love”.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s about middle-schoolers and high schoolers searching for their ideal prince and princess to be able to form their first love, and thinking optimistically to live a happy ever after but in the end they fall into some kind of other twist. Attitudes, appearances,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15188">
        and traits are the basis on picking their ideal one’s that make a well-formed twist for them to encounter. But the question is, does the searching and making love improves on each episode, well there’s a little improvement on fulfilling it and if there’s a little improvement maybe we will come up on thinking that there will be minor details about it, and the answer of it “yes there is”, and on the other hand there’s always been a shock when cupid caught their hearts that became somewhat predictable and it’s always been alike on every character. <br />
<br />
Overall it has a little improvement but many twist to make fun around them, but though the story is not finished and already on the halfway probably on its following episodes it will get serious.<br />
<br />
~Art &amp; Animation~ [7]<br />
<br />
The art is… well a bit ok for me, for the main characters to have a face that resembles a moon head figure. The art on the background is a bit faint and the characters are somewhat faded.  The animation is a bit daring for an ecchi; panties, boobs and naughty scenes are shown.<br />
<br />
~Sound~ [6.8]<br />
<br />
The OP and ED theme songs are a bit catchy and the voices of each character are an okay for me, nothing unusual to be thrilled on. <br />
<br />
~Characters~ [8]<br />
<br />
A group of middle-schoolers and some high schoolers that has distinct standard on picking their ideal partner. All of the characters have different characteristics and different affairs to encounter. Well this is not a shock that this idea will come up to the story, but come on can be this story be too simple, maybe not, but they come up on improvising character traits, attitudes and daring poses that will help to hold up viewers on watching, for me it rather looks like a little fun to watch yet it’s kind of a bit boring and for the whole thing this is all thanks for relying on naughty and romance display. <br />
<br />
~Enjoyment~  [7]<br />
<br />
Enjoyed some funny and daring scenes on watching, but it does not always gives such fun, and also by the help of the twist the story looks like a bit interesting so continuing it will not much harm yet it stills on the halfway of all its episodes, therefore, hopefully there will be more exciting scene to watch on its following episodes.<br />
<br />
~Overall~ {8 + 7 + 6.8 + 8 + 7 = 36.8 / 5} [7.36 or 7.4]<br />
<br />
A kind of unusual love affair between characters, it is somewhat unique because of the unusual attitudes of characters, it’s naughty and comedy scenes somewhat helps just to be on but thinking about it, it’s not attractive enough. Maybe the great factor here is the twist behind it. Well, it’s better to give it a try if you have much spare time to give on such anime. <br />
<br />
Maybe experiencing somnambulism will made it a lot more fun. @-@<br />
<br />
It might be updated when the series ends…

    Hatsukoi Limited. A hidden gem amongst all of the shows in its genre. This is one of those shows that I feel doesn&#039;t get as much recognition as it deserves. <br />
<br />
Hatsukoi Limited, as you may be able to guess from its name, is a story about love. It&#039;s not just about love though, it&#039;s about many qualms an adolescent will face as they climb up the ladder to adulthood, their first love being one of the steps on the ladder. For many, we look to our first love fondly--those sweet elementary and junior high days spent with who we thought was &quot;the one&quot;, and for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178163">
        others, we look at our first loves and remember the pain of rejection and heartbreak. Hatsukoi Limited capitalizes on each of these joys and flaws. A story about how ten teenager&#039;s lives change as love meddles in their affairs for the very first time. A story about their hearts as they undulate like the tides; a timeless story about maturity and growth.<br />
<br />
There are many types of love in this world: filial, platonic, unconditional, and romantic (which splits into mutual and unrequited). Hatsukoi Limited touches on all these types of love. No words can truly do the complex feelings portrayed in this anime justice; the flood of raw emotions that is unleashed simply cannot be adequately expressed. The cast is so diverse, so dynamically human that it is hard not to like. The message the show gives its viewers ring with a sharp, down to earth tone that is hopeful yet poignant. The cast of this series is one of the most believable set of characters I&#039;ve ever seen. A beautifully told simple love story, combined with realistic characters makes for the perfect love story. Where some may argue the ending didn&#039;t do a show of this caliber justice, I applaud the producers and writers for such an ending, for I feel the exact opposite.<br />
<br />
Hatsukoi Limited is a show that will make you laugh, cry, and reflect on your past and current loves through the struggles that these characters face. I can&#039;t think of many romance shows that do this.<br />
<br />
If that doesn&#039;t warrant you to watch this show, I don&#039;t know what will.

    I mean if there was one thing I learnt from myanimelist is to prepare yourself to see what the worst comments said. And frankly I have to agree with most that was said, a lot of these parings were bad or ridiculous, even when going in with the low expectations. And I&#039;ll start by explaining all the love parings this show has. Though I might end up spoiling who gets together I won&#039;t actually spoil too much of the show so you can enjoy it yourselves if you want to. Overall I find this show bad but there were some parts to it that made

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323714">
        it worth watching. So this should actuality be a 4.6 show for me.<br />
<br />
Ayumi/Zatsu/Misao (the two boys are brothers)<br />
<br />
Aihara, I don&#039;t have much to say about this girl just that she spent an awfully long time to think of a reply to a confession. Besides her actually calling Misao a monster she&#039;s alright, don&#039;t hate her don&#039;t like her.<br />
<br />
Zatsu, I would not be surprised at all if the writer just created him so they have another guy, but wait, what can I do to make the girl like him??  I know a scene with princess carrying and just gives him a dream of helping people and that&#039;s practically his whole character. He is awfully bland. Only other thing I need to mention is that he is part of a conflict because he likes another girl called Misaki<br />
 <br />
Misao is just simply a terrifying appearance with the purest heart that&#039;s why I like him but dude you need to stop acting like a stalker and following her even though you were worried about her, but at least his heart was in a good place unlike some other character.<br />
<br />
Ennomoto (Girl) and Kusadai (Guy)<br />
<br />
At first she was okay and I actually liked her..... before she started liking the guy and turned out to be a tsundere. Now that itself isn&#039;t bad but now imagine one of the worst tsundere ever possible that&#039;s her. it is full on annoying how she keeps going about looks and full on disses on the guy she likes even. It took the guy to be so annoyed with it all for her actually confess. I argue that most of the fights were her fault and I don&#039;t think she would have given chocolates to him at all if he didn&#039;t say to her &quot;I wouldn&#039;t mind getting some chocolate from anyone&quot;. Even when receiving the Christmas gloves instead of saying thanks she goes &quot; it looks good on me doesn&#039;t it&quot;<br />
<br />
The guy on the other hand I really loved his joke about the movie with animals but all that went out the bag once he diberately put a girl to sleep using bad puns so that he could advise his friend to &quot;abandon logic&quot; like just no, There are several scenes where his pervert tendencies just goes overboard  but I&#039;m just gonna stop it there. He full on is just creepy for those who hate Mineta (MHA) I argue that he&#039;s just as bad if not worst. But I guess the writers realised this mistake and went oh no we need to give him a good quality, Thanks to that he went from absolute trash to can be decent person at times and I&#039;m so happy they reduced his level of creepiness and after he became much more bearable,  I could even like him maybe if he was like that at the very start. Now I don&#039;t really care how perveted he is but there is a line, a clear one that shouldn&#039;t be crossed. it&#039;s the Mineta line and if your character is as bad as him you are doing something very wrong.<br />
<br />
The relationship itself is actually one that has quite a lot of time dedicated to it so try to give it a chance for your own sake. As much as I didn&#039;t like the characters I could still enjoy their story even though there were bad and good bits to it. One scene I did like were when they were wearing each others presents in class.<br />
<br />
Watase and Takei <br />
<br />
its a pretty plain and simple story, one people consider to be the weaker of the show unfortunately. I can see why people didn&#039;t like it so much but I found it durable enough like the part where she becomes a manager. Why I don&#039;t enjoy it much is that the comedy wasn&#039;t used much but hey if you want big boobs it&#039;s here. As boring as the story might be I like it better then others just because the pair were actually decent people and didn&#039;t have as much drama as the others. It kept things simple and did a good job of it. If you feel like it try giving it a shot, okay if you don&#039;t like it though <br />
<br />
Girl who&#039;s self conscious about her big boobs and her first love dude who sees her for more then a pair of boobs all of this combined with swimming. it&#039;s a pretty sweet paring. Unfortunately I don&#039;t really know how to describe them as they&#039;re both pretty ordinary, forgive me for leaving this one out okay.<br />
<br />
Dobashi (Girl) and Terai (Boy)<br />
<br />
This is one of the best ones in my opinion, When you first see the characters it can sort of be assumed these two would get together. what I love though is that once someone found out what was happening these two were already dating. It has none of those messy love plots where they had to go through a lot of stuff to be together and it&#039;s a first for each of them to the dating world. <br />
<br />
When first meeting Dobashi it&#039;s shown she is very respected for her talent in sport however we can also see how the boys around her saying how none of them would want to date her as I guess she would wear the &quot;pants&quot; in a relationship (she was the one that suggested to date after all). She has a strong personality but is normally closed off, though makes an effort to open her heart more often. <br />
<br />
Terai on the other hand is bad at sports as has a pretty weak personality. I love him though and he is one of my favourite male characters. He is a bit of a nervous wreck and he feels actually developed as he tries his very best to summon the courage to be a proper boyfriend. His internal struggles are made quite clear and they have a very natural romance <br />
<br />
Misaki/Zaitsu/Yoshihiko<br />
<br />
Now here is the ridiculous part of the story if it isn&#039;t ridiculous enough yet. Misaki is the love interest of these two boys. Zaitsu who is her friends brother and they all known each other for a long being neighbours and Yoshihiko who is a fellow school classmate. Yet another love triangle but this ones worst cuz it is way bigger then any triangle, maybe try polygon. Was the writer testing how many possible people he could get involved in this relationship problem or what. I feel as if this would get too complicated ad I don&#039;t want to spoil to much of the show so i&#039;ll stop here but in other words this is the biggest conflict of the show and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a good one in my opinion. I don&#039;t like how it started but I do like how straightforward it was resolved.<br />
<br />
Misaki and Yuuji<br />
<br />
Now wait a second this is the same person but with a different guy?? why don&#039;t you just include him on top. There are very simple reasons for one is it will make it even more complicated and I feel as if it will be easier to understand starting with this guy because there is so about this ship I want to talk about. <br />
<br />
Misaki gets confessed to a lot but turns them all down this is because she does not like anyone but beyond that she has never ever had a crush on anyone before so she doesn&#039;t get what it feels like. Yet one day this person who gave her a lollipop as a joke yes she falls for him. At least in the Valentine episode Misaki herself questions this love so the whole ridiculousness isn&#039;t just played of for laughs which is something I think I&#039;m happy about. Sad thing is he has a huge sister complex and considers her his most important person. That sister is Arihara. (the one with the brother love triangle). But I think everyone can all agree that this paring was one with the least time given to it. I want to say more about this but I don&#039;t want to give to much information for those who actually want to watch so I&#039;ll put the rest below. <br />
<br />
<br />
SPOILERS JUST SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH<br />
I do appreciate that she didn&#039;t have to choose between the two boys that liked her but that ending where they got together was pretty terrible and kinda rushed when Arihara barely shown any signs at all that he liked her. Or also the fact the was barely any time on these two it felt very rushed at least to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
And now I regret writing so much about a show I don&#039;t even like that much. If someone has actually read any of this or if it has actually provided any help at all then thank you at least it wasn&#039;t a total waste I guess.. Feel free to disagree to anything I say as long as it&#039;s respectful.

    Story:<br />
It&#039;s definatley the type of anime geared towards people who want something cute, substantial with a little bit of fan-service which seems to work and not offset any bais on whether or not to veiw the series. The story follows a group of girls all ranging from different ages who fall in and out of love while also discovering what it actually means to love. It&#039;s not cheesy and the stories are realistic and often funny, and most of the jokes are very well placed.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art works in favor for this anime because it&#039;s detailed in the character expressions and has this type of fluid

          <span style="display: none;" id="review17373">
        motions that really help the story progress. The facial expressions shown propell the story forwards and show that sometimes diaolouge (internal or not) isn&#039;t really needed.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The opening was a little too cheesy for me, but the ending fit just fine. The music throughout the series was unnoticable (and I only say that because I don&#039;t remember it) except for one moment where all dialouge is cast out and is replaced by a song a few minutes before the show ends.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
All of the characters are really fun and loveable. At first they seem to be pretty cookie cutter characters, and a few times they even mention thier &quot;complexes&quot; for thier preferance of boy or girl. Because of it&#039;s light-heartedness the characters range from being meek, to overly loud, to keeping everything hidden or over the top in some of their actions (but the series pulls it off very well). However, some characters featured in the intro or outro are hardly developed, the viewer sees them one time, they state what they do and they occasionally speak to the other characters but there is no real development. I just found it strange that they were added to the intro/outro in slightly memorable parts when they had little to deal with the actual show.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
10/10. I couldn&#039;t wait to see the next episode, and sometimes I stayed up really late just to see as much as I could.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
It&#039;s a short series that ends on just the right note. It doesn&#039;t make the audience want MORE because everything concluded very well (it wasn&#039;t a fluffy ending, everyone had thier different realistic endings which was super refreshing). If it was any longer then I&#039;m not sure if I would have enjoyed it as much, but it&#039;s a great series to watch if you&#039;re in the mood for something not so much meaningful as it is entertaining in how relationships develop.

    &quot;Men are all about appearance&quot; Enomoto Kei<br />
<br />
Usually I don&#039;t like watching shojo animes I rather prefer read shojo mangas, because I think that in the manga we can clearly see how much the mangaka is talented and got skills ...Well, anyway, ...<br />
<br />
Hatsukoi limited I don&#039;t have a damn idea why I loved it so much ... The story is so educative I think, in fact it shows the different love problems the teenagers are having between hesitatation and temptation, the story is told in many diffrent scenarios and each time it focus on one character only.<br />
<br />
I really did appreciate the simplicity and softness of the

<br />
I have a great time while watching this series, too bad there are only 12 episodes :(.<br />

    When I first started to watch this show, there were a few titles that immediately popped to mind, School Rumble, KimiKiss, and Boys Be... I soon found that Hatsukoi Limited has more in common with Boys Be than the others, this is due to similar themes of young love, ensemble structure, soft almost idealized atmosphere, etc.  However, what really differentiates Hatsukoi Limited from Boys Be and what really surprised me about Hatsukoi Limited was the level of comedy/fun in each episode. <br />
<br />
Much of Hatsukoi Limited comedy was derived from its characters, timing, and a bit of slapstick.  I didn&#039;t really feel dumber and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review16511">
        rarely did things ever get really stupid for the sake of comedy.  In fact the many times I laughed I would have probably cringed in lesser titles.  This shows the level of skill that was used in creating this title.  However, the best part of the comedy is how well it integrates and transitions to the drama/poignant moments seamlessly even within the course of a single episode.  While Hatsukoi Limited is mostly a fun/enjoyable title to watch, there are plenty of poignant moments for example, Chikura arc and the end of the Valentines arc.<br />
<br />
Although I use the term &#039;arc&#039; to categorize the various stories, its not as distinct as your typical &#039;arc&#039;.  By this I mean the various stories are interspersed throughout the 12 episodes, these &#039;arcs&#039; don&#039;t begin and end within 1or 2 episode.  Yes, there are episodes that focus on certain stories but at the same time Hatsukoi Limited will address and move other storylines.  While, this may sound overly complicated, especially with its large cast, it never seems like that.  This is because, they introduce the various plotlines slowly and seamlessly.  It is only when you sit down and actually try to map out all the relationships will you realize how complex it is.  Plus at the same time you get to see most of the characters mature throughout the series.<br />
<br />
There is a catch concerning the story/characters, with such a large cast, a complex relationship chart, and only 12 episodes the characterization does suffer a bit.  A few of the characters could have been eliminated and I doubt anyone would really miss them, honestly I wish they did get rid of them as they were either annoying or boring.  Also, with such a huge cast, even some of the &quot;main&quot; characters lacked some development, this is why I said &quot;most&quot; in the previous paragraph. <br />
<br />
Despite the problems with the large cast of character and short time, I found most of the characters extremely likeable and can relate to them.  Also, if one looks at Hatsukoi Limited purely from theme point of view, it does capture the various aspects of a first love and to do this you need a large cast.<br />
<br />
Another complaint I have would be too much focus on the girls side, in particular the middle school girls, by the animators.   I&#039;m not implying that the male characters lacked any characterization/development or are weak characters, they just spend too much focusing on the girls point of view.  This was apparent by the last arc which has a strong focus on the middle school boys and I felt as if they needed a bit more time seeing things from their point of view in earlier episodes to make the final arc stronger.  Once again cutting down the cast and/or increasing the length would solve these problems.  I heard the manga (source) was cut short, so I guess it can&#039;t be helped however, J.C. Staff did an amazing job with what they had leaving me both wanting more and completely satisfied (sadly I can&#039;t make any comparisons to the manga as I have yet to read it...). <br />

Since this was done by a well known studio animation the expectations for animation quality was quite high.  In terms of consistency and animation they succeeded.  There was never a point I noticed any inconsistency with the character designs nor did the movements feel choppy (granted there wasn&#039;t much action...).   However, the backgrounds seemed almost missing at times, not really a major complaint as most of the time we&#039;re looking at the characters.  The character designs were done by Mizuki Kawashita, of Ichigo 100% fame, and are beautifully done.  Her designs seem to work perfectly with the watercolor-like animation and add to the soft, idealized, almost nostalgic feel of the series.  However, since she is also known for Ichigo 100%, we are treated to or forced to endure (depending on your view) fanservice moments.  Personally, I wasn&#039;t really distracted/annoyed by those moments, as it didn&#039;t feel overly forced.<br />

Hatsukoi Limited a well executed romance anime that focuses on &quot;first love&quot;.  It also has very well timed jokes and a very endearing cast who are often the reason the jokes are funny instead of cringe worthy.  To show the various aspects of a first love Hatsukoi Limited has a huge cast but at the same time suffers due to this huge cast.  In particular, lack of characterization and development for many of the character, hell even a few of the main characters.  This made a few of the characters kind of worthless and will not be missed if written out.  However, since the manga was cut short and thus only 12 episodes, I can be lenient.  Nevertheless, JC Staff did an amazing job wtih the adaptation leaving me wanting more and completely satisfied.  JC Staff also did an amazing job on the animation and art and was also very consistent, granted the background lacks details.  KimiKiss, Toradora, and now Hatsukoi Limited, J.C. Staff is quickly becoming a studio I associate with quality romance anime.

    Hatsukoi Limited was good but it was not great. I would say it&#039;s worth mentioning but in all honesty, there are other anime that I would recommend over Hatsukoi Limited. When I saw the first episode, I immediately compared this anime to Amagami SS and I can see that many other people have done the same. I will have to agree with everybody and say that Amagami SS is better than Hatsukoi Limited. That doesn&#039;t mean that Hatsukoi Limited was not a good anime. I just felt that there was room for improvement. Let&#039;s start with the negatives and we&#039;ll work our way to the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review45235">
        positives because despite having some bad points, this anime is worth it for me to leave you, the reader, with a positive impression of it in the end.<br />
<br />
Negatives:<br />
I felt the storyline was very typical. Much more typical than other romance anime. What I found unique was that each character had her own story and in the end, it all tied together. Everybody&#039;s story tied together; however, I felt that the point of the anime started to stray off it&#039;s path and onto a different path. When the anime starts off, i felt that I was going to enjoy it because I get to learn about each character, go through their lives, their struggles, the love. However, towards the end of the anime, or about 2/3rds through, I felt that the anime started to focus more on one couple. Not only did it start to focus on this couple more but it was the most typical of the couple. You had the school&#039;s prettiest girl who starts off as shallow with a boy that constantly tease her. Both seem to hate each other but the tables are turned towards the end. I&#039;m not going to even consider this a spoiler because it&#039;s extremely obvious and very predicting. I was quite disappointed that the anime started to focus on this couple towards the end rather than to stick to a broad focus on all the characters. Speaking of the characters, this is one of the anime that I&#039;ve watched that had quite a handful of characters. This isn&#039;t a bad thing and I actually liked it; however, I was left disappointed with the character development. I felt that the anime rushed through some of the characters and spent more time with others. The anime made it clear that these people were the main characters, but then next episode it seems to just drop that character and move onto another. I wanted to know more about girl A or I wanted to know about the past of girl b. One girl that showed up quite a few times didn&#039;t even get a storyline nor a sweetheart. In fact, they introduced her as the older sister as one of the other main girls but they didn&#039;t even bother mentioning her name. They probably did mention it, but I don&#039;t remember it because they hardly mentioned her yet she showed up quite a few times and even interacted with all the characters. The creators put her on the cover with all the main girls, they put her in the opening, the closing, yet me as the viewer don&#039;t even get to know anything about her? What&#039;s up with that? One of the boy characters seemed to also have an interesting past yet they explained nothing of his past. All you know is that he is feared, he gets in a lot of fights, and he wins a lot of fights. However, I want to know why he gets in these fights, why is he like this, why do people want to beat him up, why is he undefeated? None of those questions were answered, he simply showed up as someone who is scary, can fight, and loves one of the girls. In one of the scenes towards the second half of the whole anime, one of the girls go &quot;you&#039;re fast right?!&quot; and she makes him run. I thought &quot;why is he fast and how did you know he was fast?&quot; Again, the question was left unanswered. One last negative was that one of the girl was shown as to having a boyfriend already; however, she did not start with the boy. The anime eventually explained how they met up but I felt that their story was the most rush as all this happens in approximately 1 episode. I want to know more, I want to know more of this girl&#039;s past and this boy&#039;s past. The character development was probably one of the worst aspect to this anime. I felt so empty from some of the characters. <br />
<br />
Positives:<br />
Despite some of the negatives, I felt that it did not really hinder the overall enjoyment of the anime. The stories were cute and very sweet despite being quite typical. One of the first story you are introduced to is a straight up copy of Beauty and the Beast. The title of the episode is even called Beauty and the Beast. However, despite being a story we all heard before, the way the creators tackled it was cute and very funny. I enjoyed the large amount of characters and I&#039;m glad they all had their own story and their own love interest. Some of the stories were much more unique than others and that&#039;s okay since the anime is composed of a bunch of short stories. One of my favorite aspect to the anime is that in the end, everyone&#039;s story ties together. Despite having some predictable scenes, it was still very cute and got me smiling when the scene came. EXAMPLE: Sure, you can watch an anime and say &quot;they&#039;re going to kiss&quot; but when the scene actually happens I can&#039;t help but still smiling due to how the creators really tackled it in Hatsukoi Limited. Each character is drawn very well and I just absolutely love the art style. It resembles the art style of Amagami SS which I think gives a very mature and real-life atmosphere to the anime. The art style didn&#039;t really exaggerate all the love in the air of the anime which really made everything so much sweeter.<br />
<br />
Overall, I give this anime an 8 out of 10. It would have gotten a 9 if the characters were further developed and the stories kept going but I felt that some stories were just too short and some were just too rushed. I would still recommend this anime to all your romance anime lovers but if you haven&#039;t seen Amagami SS then watch Hatsukoi Limited first, then watch Amagami SS. I would definitely rewatch Hatsukoi Limited but I probably wouldn&#039;t watch it more than twice.

    Usually I am not a huge fan of 12 or less episode series, but this was among one of the few that I really enjoyed. Each episode brought the story along bit by bit, and for the amount of characters that were involved in the anime, I was fairly astounded with how they managed to fit all of it into 12 episodes. There were a few odds and ends that probably could have been touched up a bit more, but no complaints there.<br />
<br />
As a male, I did enjoy the random ecchi moments, but then I also did enjoy the way they could take the females,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review16346">
        and be both serious and ecchi at the same time. Most times its usually either a serious plot, or just massive amounts of boobs, but this anime managed to create a decent (but not perfect) balance between the two.<br />
<br />
After the first few episodes I wasn&#039;t really sure of what to think, but by the end of the series I was left with an overall good impression of the series. <br />
<br />
I&#039;d suggest it to anyone who was into romance plots and character development for sure.

    “All of us are in love. It hasnt all been smooth sailing. Mistakes may have been made. But the love we felt when we first met our sweethearts is certainly the most cherished thing. We will take those feelings one by one and carry them with us into our futures.” <br />
There couldnt have been a better ending words to this anime.<br />

Anime review:-<br />
Anime:- Hatsukoi Limited<br />
Genre:- Romace/Comedy/School/Drama<br />
Number of episodes-12<br />
<br />
Rating:- Animation and Artwork-7, Music-9, Voice Acting-9, Story-9, Characters-8, Coherence-10, Enjoyment-9.5(61.5/70) This is for par-8 scale, if rescaled to par-6, this anime will get a 7.5/10(above par/should be watched by this genre lovers)<br />
<br />
This anime was suggested to me by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review185375">
        a friend. I have to admit had seen this one in the myanimelist but I didnt think it would be that good so skipped it. However since he suggested and he knew what I liked I gave it a shot and I was totally taken by surprise.<br />
This anime deals with first love. First love of 16 characters. Yes you read that right, 16 characters. And surprisingly the story does not feel disjoint. Every character&#039;s life gets interwined with the others in one form or the other. And that is one of the greatest aspects of this anime. The story seems bland, a staple school life comedy for quite large sections of the anime and then it suddenly hits you with some mature handling of the embarrassment and confusion of first love and the depression of your first rejection. And yes there are quite a few situations of misunderstandings in the anime and they have actually been handled pretty well. They might seem really ordinary, but the way they are handled is what makes this anime really worth your watch.<br />
<br />
Animation is well not really that great, that the backgrounds are painted is actually pretty obvious in many places. The character drawings are decent. The music and OSTs will take you by surprise. Some romantic scenes have Clannad-esque OSTs(probably somebody from Clannad worked here) and the ending song was just amazing. It also had two different eneding for two of its episodes since the normal ending wouldnt have fit well, and it worked like a charm. And I was somehow impressed by the voice acting. They brought out the emotions really well. And as I had mentioned before the anime was coherent , they managed to interwine all the characters into one single big story really well.<br />
<br />
Final Verdict:- Of course at the end of the day this is a generic high school romance story but a high school romance story done right for the most part. Thats why it is not exceptional, but you cant miss it if you are a lover of this genre.

    Before you watch the anime, you can take my review and others as comparison to what you imagine.<br />
<br />
&quot;あなたはいま恋をしてますか？”<br />
&quot;Anata wa koi wo shitemasuka?&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you in love right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe this question will be say numerously in this series. Your answer maybe various, but you will love this series if you search love genre anime.<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
I give 9 points, it has clear plot, you will not confused when watching this series.  <br />
The story is quite complicated, one-sided love everywhere, well because of we cannot give spoiler here, you should watch it by yourself.<br />
This series is adapted by a manga with the same title.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
The characters are drawn

          <span style="display: none;" id="review159203">
        smoothly, and beautiful. I love the most our princess-like-Kei Enomoto. lol <br />
9 thumps for charactesr.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
Quite good, both OST opening and ending sang greatly. The VAs are great too. Some famous VAs are involved in this series Aki Tokisaki as Ayumi-chan. <br />
You will be not disappointed.<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
A lot of personality are in this series. A bunch of middle schooler, run away from their home, to overcome their despair in love, to stand up once more,because his love is unrequited one, and searching for braveness to confess his love. Personally, I love to see these change inside the boy&#039;s characteristic. It depicts well here. Once more, i would say, You will be not disappointed.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
WOHOOOOOOO,I really enjoy this series, there are a lot of &#039;feels&#039; scene when the truth about one-sided love. Also light joke inside, will not let you stop watching this<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
It&#039;s recommended for anyone who love light-love story, a story when you fall in love for the first time.<br />
<br />

    Well,  i was excited when i started the anime.. and by the time it ended... I was like WTF is this??? all the pairs were wronk except aihara and zaitsu and yuuji and yamamoto... everything was going wrong... the sound was nothing good nothing bad.. just .. it was. and the story? it is divided in arcs so not much of a story in it.. art? the only proper art was Yamamoto&#039;s body and her curves... character? hey, if you look like a kappa, how can a beautiful girl like you?? it may be possible in animes but dude you can end up in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review187730">
        jail at worst if you try to do something....  I want my 4 hours back.. excluding the 2 pairs i enjoyed watching- Yamamoto and Yuuji and Aihara and Zaitsu..

    &quot;A lot of stories about first love are about to begin.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, a lot of love triangles are about unfold. Hatsukoi (First Love) Limited. is basically a group of short stories about middle- and high-schoolers dealing with their first love that are somehow connected. The problem is, any of those couples could have their own show, and one or two episodes about them are just not enough. Still, the anime does turn out all right, with humour, sexiness, and drama included; not to mention romance, of course. Like I said in the forum, episode 9 is far and away my favorite, as it is the most

          <span style="display: none;" id="review41277">
        innocent, mature, and tragic.<br />
<br />
It is hard to tell the synopsis here because, as I just mentioned, there are a lot of tales, but let us pretend that the first one is the most important. Five middle-schoolers talk about love, and one in particular, Arihara Ayumi, dreams about being confessed to by a handsome prince. As they are leaving school, they are confronted by a scary, large man that looks like a beast and pulls something out of his pocket, making the terrified girls think he is taking out a knife. It turns out to be just a letter directed towards Arihara. He, Zaitsu Misao, leaves right after handing it to her. Actually, it is a love letter, which shatters Ayumi&#039;s romantic fantasies . . .<br />
<br />
Describing the characters in Hatsukoi Limited. is similar to drawing a relationship chart (which has already been done) since there are so many of them, but I will go ahead anyway for the sake of making the review complete. First off, there is the heroine (apparently), Arihara Ayumi, who is a feisty, strong girl that beats up her brother whenever he acts inappropriately. Her brother, Arihara Yuuji, loves his little sister a lot, but she does not feel the same way about him. His classmate, Bessho Yoshihiko, is in love with a girl in the same class, Misaki. Ayumi&#039;s classmate, Zaitsu Mamoru, also has a secret crush on Misaki, who is his neighbor. Yamamoto Misaki is Misao&#039;s childhood friend and is good at martial arts. Zaitsu Misao is Mamoru&#039;s older brother in high school that has a bad reputation and a scary face, frightening most of those that look at him; when he saw Mamoru&#039;s class picture one day, he fell for Ayumi, and realized his feelings later, after almost dying in a fight and being taken to the hospital. Bessho&#039;s little sister, Bessho Koyoi, is infatuated with her older brother, but does not realize that he likes someone else. Her friend, Chikura Nao, is in the art club and admires Renjou, a senpai whom she has never met, but has been drawn by his paintings; she has an older brother that is described as &quot;hot&quot; by Kei. Another classmate of theirs is my least favorite character, Dobashi, an athletic, sometimes quiet, girl who is in the tennis club and is secretly dating a boy in the same school, named Terai. Weak at sports, the glasses-wearing Terai could not keep up when playing tennis, so after getting private training from Dobashi, they started going out together. In the same class as her is Kusuda, a middle-schooler that likes dirty books; he often bickers with a girl called Kei, who says he has a kappa-(mythical creature that has a plate-like object over its head; in Nagasarete Airantou (Casted Away: Airan Island), it appears, but the protagonist, who is science-oriented, believes it to be a turtle)face. She, Enomoto Kei, is a beautiful girl that looks more mature than she really is, and thus is called an old woman by Kusuda; the two of them are supposed to pair up together, but they just do not fit each other. Zaitsu and Kusuda&#039;s circle completes with Sogabe, a quiet guy who is not in a hurry to find love. Finally, Watase Meguru, Yamamoto and Enomoto&#039;s older sister&#039;s classmate, used to be an Olympic candidate as a swimmer in middle school, but has since given it up to hide her enormous breasts, which got her teased; she used to like Takei, a senpai passionate for swimming, too.<br />
<br />
The seiyuu generally fit their respective characters. It is notable that Roronoa Zoro&#039;s voice actor from One Piece also plays Takei in First Love Limited. There is also a nice soundtrack. The opening sequence includes scenes of the middle school girls, whereas the ending sequence shows all the females in cosplay pictures.<br />
<br />
The artwork is at a high level. I may not like some character designs, but you can tell they were meant to look the way they are. The animators (and seiyuu) certainly did a way better job than the ones who did the author&#039;s more famous work, Ichigo (Strawberry) 100%, whose heroine, Toujou Aya is like a shy, weaker version of Yamamoto Misaki.<br />
<br />
This is another one of those anime that I do not regret watching, and, in fact, I would be willing to watch it again some day. The stories are mostly beautiful, lighthearted, romantic, naïve and hilarious (wait until you see episode 8, &quot;The Melancholy of the Chocolate Bomber&quot;). The series has my stamp of approval.

    * Spoilers Ahead * <br />
<br />
Hatsukoi Limited is best described a collection of short stories revolving numerous characters each with their own unique story.<br />
It&#039;s very hard to right a review with so many stories that are connected to only anime season, so i will break this down by character (Key).<br />
<br />
Plot - Follows a group of 5 girls who seek a relationship or their first love, each episodes focuses on a different girl (First episode is Arihara Ayumi&#039;s) <br />
<br />
Characters (Plus my opinion on them)<br />
--------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Arihara Ayumi<br />
- A bubbly character who is asked out by Misao Zaitzu (Monster). Though she claimed she would accept any offer, she is consistently

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25795">
        unsettled by Zaizu&#039;s monstrous appearance. However, she shows she can be somewhat caring as well as crafty, you see her a little at the start where she is trying not to hurt Misao&#039;s feelings, when she then meets her &quot;First Love At First Sight&quot; who is Zaitzu&#039;s brother.<br />
she has to ask herself does Zaitzu&#039;s brother really love her or does she have feelings for Misao if she can look beyond his looks.<br />
<br />
Kei Enomoto<br />
- LOVE this storyline, Kei is apparently very popular with guys due to her &quot;mature&quot; face. However, she sees the attention she receives as a hassle, and believes confessions of love are just a chore if the feeling isn&#039;t mutual. She openly admits that looks are a major factor in choosing a relationship, but carries a love-hate (mostly hate) relationship with Kusuda, Who she nicknames &quot;Kappa Face&quot; they have a relationship where they both are too immature to realize there feelings, this part becomes the main storyline, for some the other characters story&#039;s may just get in the way of this one but i think its done perfectly and even this story NEEDED the others.<br />
<br />
Koyoi Bessho<br />
- Sub character really who is shown a few times, she mainly has a brother complex.<br />
<br />
Nao Chikura <br />
- Another sub character (Kinda) a guy who is connected to the story loves her but does she really love him or does she love a senpai she&#039;s known for years.<br />
<br />
Dobashi, Rika<br />
- The most level headed out of the group, Rika seems to enjoy teasing others. She is in Ayumi&#039;s grade. A well known tom-boy, Doba excels in athletics and has been stated to be domineering.<br />
Through athletics she finds a shy guy who loves her, they form a relationship straight away, she is featured a few times usually to balance out the group.<br />
<br />
There is PLENTY more characters who are also featured, they seem to all revolve around the brothers or the group of girls, some have strong points some don&#039;t but overall even in the sub characters they are really good to watch and make the whole show, a rare occasion is i didn&#039;t dislike anyone (well maybe 1 kind of).<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
*A special menthion once again for the Enomoto/Kusuda storyline which was fantastic, the rest were really good and all different but compelling all the same, this is due to some AMAZING writing for this series. <br />
<br />
*The artwork is stunning and in Blu-ray it looks mindblowing at some points. <br />
<br />
*The sound is good nothing wrong with them, they suit the characters perfectly.<br />
<br />
*Character development is great you see them ALL progress which is rare to see.<br />
<br />
*I cannot get over how good the Enomoto/Kusuda storyline was its worth it just for that tbh, althought the ending is good but like many series in the Comedy/Romance section they end abruptly which is a bit dissapointing and lets it down (Slightly) for me, don&#039;t get me wrong this series is amazing but it just takes a edge of it which is why i give it an 9.<br />

    Hatsukoi Limited is an interesting series depicting the first loves (Hatsukoi) of a group of middle school girls. It is essentially a relationship-based slice-of-life story. Though a show with many girls typically leads to a harem, this is definitely not so. Each of the girls has their own pick, and there are an equal numbers of supporting male characters.<br />
<br />
What makes Hatsukoi unique is the sheer number of relationships between the characters. If you don&#039;t like keeping track of who likes who and who did what to who, then stay away from this. This is a really hard series to judge as I feel that capping

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203914">
        the series at 12 episodes made the story progression rushed, especially at the end. Overal Hatsukoi was a fairly good watch, and the story is much improved from the author&#039;s previous work, Ichigo 100%.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
The animation quality is somewhat lackluster in my opinion. While I was very happy that this series had much less fan service than Ichigo, the overall design was a bit simplistic for its time. The color palette is a bit dull and backgrounds tend to be bland. The characters themselves are okay but nothing outstanding, probably because there were so many of them given the length of this series...<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The OP and ED are fair, though I have no idea why they show the characters in cosplay in the ED... The BGM is also fair but not very memorable. The VAs are good as usual, I liked Aki Toyosaki&#039;s performance as Koyoi, even though she hasn&#039;t had many major roles.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The series did a great job at developing the characters and establishing character relationships throughout the series. I had a lot of fun creating a graph of relationships just to keep track of what was happening in the show. There are a lot of ironic moments as well as some dramatic cliffhangers.<br />
<br />
My only major complaint is the one that I already pointed out; though the series concluded well, I didn&#039;t really know that I was at the end of the series or even that I had passed the climax until I was well into the last episode. My only other thought is that the show leaves an opening for further development, though obviously none has come in the past four years.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
The sheer number of characters may be a bit overwhelming for such a short series. Though a lot of relationships are established between the characters, their appearance time is greatly varied. For instance, one character will become the protagonist for one episode before disappearing into a minor supporting role. There are also a lot of additional supporting characters that make only brief appearances in the series, which only makes the series even more cluttered. I really liked the development in this series but I they could have easily done just as well with fewer supporting characters.<br />
<br />
Value:<br />
This series was an interesting watch, and the developments were fun to keep track of. Knowing what the climax is now, a second watch puts the previous events in a new light. I&#039;m certain that if they extended it to a 18-24 ep series, it would have been much more well rounded. Sadly, it isn&#039;t so. Regardless, it&#039;s a good watch for those who like developing relationships.

    Hatsukoi Limited is a lesson on how to successfully tell multiple compelling stories in a short amount of time. You&#039;re not going to see anything you haven&#039;t seen done before but everything here is done well and given time to breathe. <br />
<br />
Story - 8<br />
<br />
Like I said above, you&#039;re not going to see anything you haven&#039;t seen before but it&#039;s all done well and with care. The story focuses on a collection of students ranging from 14-16 years of age and their first experiences with love amongst each other. Every main character (and there are a bunch of them) gets their story told and surprisingly it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321607">
        never feels rushed. Some characters have more interesting stories than others but they&#039;re all compelling for the most part. This is a bit of a slow build though in my opinion. I found the 2nd half to be a 9/10 and the first half to be a solid 7/10 so 8 felt like an appropriate score to give. <br />
<br />
Art- 9<br />
<br />
Art is always going to be a very subjective category when reviewing anime but I really enjoyed the art style here. As I&#039;m writing this now the show is 10 years old so I think it&#039;s held up well over that time. Is it perfect? Of course not but nothing stood out to me that was distracting. <br />
<br />
Sounds - 9<br />
<br />
Sounds is either going to be really good or awful. There isn&#039;t a lot of in between with this category. I felt like the voice actors did a great job conveying the proper emotion with their lines. There were a few moments in particular that stood out as very good acting but I won&#039;t spoil anything. <br />
<br />
Characters - 10<br />
<br />
This is the part of the show I was so impressed with. Yes, there are a lot of typical character traits going on here but they&#039;re all done so well. With such a big cast and so many different love stories to tell it would be easy for some characters to be lifeless but I felt like everyone here could be real. Every character was given enough time to make me care about them and also enough time to experience some personal growth. With only 12 episodes to work with I find that to be very impressive. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 9<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t possibly give this anything lower than a 9. Like I said before, I didn&#039;t enjoy the first 5 episodes nearly as much as the last 7 but I was never bored once and as the last episode finished I had a big, dumb smile on my face. You really can&#039;t ask for much more than that with anime. If this were 24 episodes I could see myself getting a little tired but 12 episodes was surprisingly perfect. Usually I hate when a show I love only has 12 episodes. <br />
<br />
Overall - 9<br />
<br />
I was honestly giving this show an 8 after episode 10 but I really enjoyed the way this show wrapped up in the last 2 episodes. This show was a lot of fun overall. It&#039;s not a game changer or anything but it&#039;s definitely something I&#039;ll revisit in the future. It left enough of an impression on me to want to write this review at least. For anyone that enjoys a good ROMCOM, you&#039;ll appreciate this. <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading.

    Has very strong first 2 episodes, but goes downhill afterwards.<br />
<br />
It starts by introducing the relationship mentioned in the synopsis, which threatens to equally likely fall into either the &quot;Gentle Giant + Loli&quot; trope you may have seen in other shows if you are a romcom fan or some stalker horror story. It quickly grows into a triangle in the very first episode, and there is sort of a resolution at least about the fear aspect that&#039;s simultaneously a bit cliched and with an interesting twist at the end.<br />
<br />
In the second episode another relationship is tacked on to the chain and I&#039;m almost sad that the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411174">
        focus is shifted away from what I thought was the main theme. The growing relationship network is perhaps a bit more boring as it now has two clear favorite sides and a doomed side between them, but the situation is still ok. The new character certainly is interesting enough to make me forgive the distraction. It still seems like a potential 10/10 story show at this point.<br />
<br />
As we go on further however, the relationship web keeps expanding until we have a whole football team of &quot;main&quot; characters with a whole lot of &quot;setup&quot; and very little &quot;development&quot;. This makes the show way too bloated, each particular sub-story too brief and watered down by the others, the details of the initially introduced relations (or any other for that matter) that originally seemed interesting become unimportant, etc. Towards the end we do get some progress for several of the central relationships &quot;in bulk&quot;, but not a conclusive resolution to most so the show feels unfinished and unsatisfying.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, I am disappointed. None of the components of this show were bad by themselves, but the overall combination somehow didn&#039;t work. Most of all, the contrast of my mistaken initial impression/expectations and reality makes me lower the score down to 6.

    Hatsukoi Limited. Talks about young puppy love... Ahhhhhh &lt;3. i totally remembered my youthful days.. oh those days... It reminds me of how good being young once...<br />
<br />
You know when you see magic for the 1st time?  And you get this amazing feeling after. Well that&#039;s how i felt from this anime, totally sparked some fire inside me. Love is also like magic, you&#039;re filled with mixed emotions but above it all the joy you feel after someone tells you i love you, it&#039;s totally heart warming. This is totally a hidden gem i am very glad i found it.<br />
<br />
Art/animation is very very good!!!! I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277723">
        like the design on the female characters it&#039;s quite cute and lovely, i also like the design of the boys it really suits who they really are. I give it 10/10<br />
<br />
The story is quite amazing too. Although it&#039;s not fixed on a certain couple/character, but i guess it really worked well, even though it&#039;s quite short for each of them but at least we all get the point no more wishy wash, i like it plain and simple, not too long and not too dramatic. we all need these kind of twists to keep us away from boredom. I give it a 10/10 just for that simplicity and the warmness it brings.<br />
<br />
And so for the music, wow, i truly believe that music has a major key role to play on this. Not just this but also on every music that adds up to the hype of the anime. I like it very much, i definitely wanna search it to know and listen to it more.<br />
<br />
So who is the best waifu? Well for me that would be Misaki Yamamoto &lt;3. I&#039;m not into young girls or neither do i have a sister com, i&#039;m not a Pedo! Like that big dude! (Although i&#039;m a big dude my self, a father of two, who likes cute things xD)<br />
As for the whole anime 10/10. Wow.
