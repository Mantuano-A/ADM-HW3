    When asked, a lot of people don&#039;t like idol anime or anything similar, or in other words, anime based on music and stuff. I&#039;m one of these people. I don&#039;t usually watch idol anime, but I wanted to try this out because of the outstanding art that this anime offers.<br />
<br />
At first I was really hesitant, even to the point where I removed it off my PTW list because I would feel embarrassed having watched something like this. Sure this anime might be targeted towards children rather than teens/adults, but it doesn&#039;t mean that teens/adults wouldn&#039;t enjoy this. This anime taught to me that hard work

          <span style="display: none;" id="review101393">
        actually does pay off, that if you try your hardest, you will eventually arrive to your destination point. <br />
<br />
There are a lot of things I liked about this anime, but the thing I liked most was probably the art. Yes, I&#039;m a very picky person when it comes to art, and this anime reached my expectations when it came to the art. All the characters were nicely designed and all of the 9 girls are cute. In other words, the art was what some people call it, flawless.<br />
<br />
The only thing I disliked about this anime was the fact that they were taking too long to prepare for the live shows and stuff like that. The producers should have shown the girls in action more (I don&#039;t literally mean in action, I meant that they should probably have shown more of their songs).<br />
<br />
In terms of characters, all of them are easily likable, none of them are really that bland. There are 3 main characters in this anime, Honoka, who is seriously hyper and energetic, Umi who is very shy and was reluctant to become a school idol at first, and Kotori who is a very calm, and a little shy. <br />
<br />
We have these 3 main characters make an school idol group in order to save the school from closing (because they aren&#039;t reaching the applicant quota). They name this school idol group &#039;Muse&#039; (sorry I don&#039;t want to look all over the internet just for a greek character). Eventually they reach 9 members by around episode 6-9, forgot. That&#039;s basically it for the story since I don&#039;t want to spoil a lot.<br />
<br />
The sound is the second thing I enjoyed a lot in this anime. The opening was just straight up amazing, I almost watched it every episode. I don&#039;t usually watch endings because they&#039;re usually dull and boring, but I really loved the ending song this time, I ended up watching it every episode. The insert songs were amazing too, I ended up downloading that &#039;Dash&#039; song too (it was that good :&gt;).<br />
<br />
I could probably say that I felt embarrassed inside while watching the first few episodes due to this being my first idol anime, but eventually I got used to the feeling and I opened myself up to this anime. All in all I could say that I enjoyed this anime a lot for my first idol anime, and I would suggest this to anyone who is looking for an idol anime.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading :&gt;<br />

    Trashy Pandas 		Love Live! School Idol Project Review			May 22, 2014<br />
<br />
*THIS ONLY CONTAINS THE FIRST SEASON I WILL EVENTUALLY GET AROUND TO WRITING THE REVIEW FOR THE ENTIRE SERIES BUT SCHOOL IS TAKING UP ALL OF MY TIME*<br />
<br />
“Datte kanosei kanjitanda. Sou da susume. Kokai shitaku nai me no mae ni bokura no michi ga aru.”<br />
“I feel we have a chance. Yes let&#039;s push forward. I don&#039;t want to regret it later. Our future lies right ahead.” from the song Susume by Muse. <br />
	Hope. Desires. Goals. Perseverance. Friendship. Love. Music. The girls of the school idol group Muse share all of these wonderful things as they give

          <span style="display: none;" id="review144189">
        it their all to be a part of the most popular event for high school idol groups: Love Live. The nine girls strive to save their school from closing by trying to attract perspective students through the formation of a school idol group that, they hope, will one day be a part of Love Live. Honoka Kousaka leads her group of eight other cute, talented high school friends towards Love Live. The anime Love Live! School Idol Project has become my #1 favorite anime because of the wonderful, loveable, and memorable characters, the outstanding animation style, and, most importantly, the best, most addictive, and energetic soundtrack, which all culminate into one amazing story of friendship, love, hope, and music. <br />
<br />
I Plot<br />
	The plot for Love Live! Is very straight forward, easy to follow, and enjoyable. The story goes as anyone would expect after watching the first episode: the main character and her friends work to save their school from closing by trying to attract new students by gaining popularity through the formation of a school idol group which becomes known as “Muse”. This formula is followed for most of the story, however there are several complications that are not expected and some twists. I&#039;m not going to spoil it, even though this is a review. While being not very complex, the plot forms a solid foundation for the anime, is consistently present, and keeps the story progressing. There is not much else to say without spoiling the twists and turns. The plot fits well and proves fairly interesting. <br />
<br />
II Romance?<br />
	There are no “official” romances in Love Live!, however, there are subtle and clear hints at possible relationships that could be. My favorite of the possible romances is Honoka x Maki. Honoka is the energetic, lively leader of Muse while Maki is very level-headed and reserved. I love the contrast that would make their relationship work like a charm. Other than this, there are no relationships to expand on, you just get enjoyment from shipping the girls together. <br />
<br />
III Theme<br />
	The main theme of Love Live! Is never give up despite how impossible the road ahead may seem and always remember that your friends are there with you every step of the way. Friends are there to stick with you through thick and thin, good and bad weather, shit storms and double rainbows. Also, be aware of your friends and their feelings. Another key part of the theme is to never give up on your dreams. No matter how many setbacks and roadblocks are in the way, the prize at the end of the road is worth the experiences that are encompassed by the journey. The theme is not much more complex than this. <br />
<br />
IV Animation and Art Style<br />
	The animation for Love Live! Is mind-blowingly amazing. For the most part, the animation and art is in 2D, but when the girls put on their performances, the animation switches over to 3D character models for exciting, energetic dance routines. Starting with the 2D aspect, the girls have extremely cute, distinguishing physical appearances. I love the designs for the girls&#039; eyes; the eyes are realistically proportioned and detailed. The girls&#039; bodies are realistic and resemble what actual high school girls would look like, i.e. they don&#039;t have obnoxiously large breasts and overly exaggerated sexual features except Nozomi, who has large breasts but not to the point that it&#039;s the only thing the viewer cares about or notices. I love that the girls aren&#039;t sexualized like in a lot of anime such as Sekirei or High School DxD; I feel the anime would have been totally different if that were the case. As for the surroundings and environment, it&#039;s pretty standard. NOW, for the 3D animation. Wow, wow, this hits it out of the ballpark: 3D song and dance routines that will make you sit in awe while watching these amazingly cute girls have the time of their lives. I wish that there were a lot more of these, but I highly doubt the animation budget could have incorporated them. Still, I digress, the 3D animation makes a massive impact on the viewers and is just spectacular. <br />
<br />
V Characters<br />
	The characters in Love Live! Are some of  my favorite characters of all time because of how unique, well designed, and beautiful they are. Honoka Kousaka, the protagonist, is an extremely lively, spontaneous, and strong willed girl who will do anything to achieve her dreams. Honoka forms Muse with her friends, Umi and Kotori before reaching out to get more girls to help with reaching their goal. Honoka is so lovable; she is so determined to do everything she can to keep her school from being closed down. There isn&#039;t anything bad to say about her.  Umi Sonoda, one of Honoka&#039;s best friends from childhood, is a very calm, sensible, and serious girl who does archery at the high school while being a part of Muse. Umi is very talented with poetry and has superb writing skills; she writes mostly all of the lyrics for Muse&#039;s songs. Umi is just as determined as Honoka, but a lot more forceful when it comes to accomplishing things. She is a very lovable and is attractive in as a strong female character. Kotori Minami, who is my favorite character and my #1 waifu, is probably  THE most  adorable character I&#039;ve ever seen. I love her hairstyle; it&#039;s a champagne blonde color, sort of more ash colored (I don&#039;t know how to adequately describe the various shades of hair color). The way she wears it is straight down in the back with a shoulder length pony tail that is combined into a folding thing. I don&#039;t know how to describe it, but it&#039;s absolutely adorable (look it up on google images). Kotori is a very shy girl who loves her friends, and the members of Muse, more than anything. The other members of Muse are Eri Ayase, Nico Yazawa, Nozomi Tojo, Maki Nishikino, Hanayo Koizumi, and Rin Hoshizora. Eri is the leader of the high school&#039;s student council; she was apposed to the idea of Muse, but ended up joining and loving the experience. Eri is very kind, hardworking, earnest, and the best dancer in Muse. Nico Yazawa was the head of the School Idol Research Club at the school, who had previously been a part of the school&#039;s former  idol group. She is extremely passionate about the group&#039;s success and wants more than anything for Muse to be a part of Love Live. She is a very tsundere-esque character but has a very sweet side that makes up for the annoying side. Nozomi Tojo is the manipulative student council vice president who indirectly helps Honoka form Muse. Nozomi also gives Muse it&#039;s name. Nozomi is very rational and the most caring member of the group; she sees deep into the other characters&#039; feelings and does whatever she can to help them out. But she loves boobs, a lot... she grabs the other characters&#039; breasts all the time.  Maki, is the beautiful girl with dark red hair whose musical talent exceeds anything that I could ever hope to do. She is an amazing composer and does most of the work to set Umi&#039;s lyrics to a dynamic, lively tune. Similar to Umi, she is very reserved and has a lot of trouble being open with the other girls of Muse. Maki is a genius whose family wants her to become a medical doctor and inherit the family&#039;s hospital. Hanayo Koizumi is one of the three first years who is Muse&#039;s biggest fan before she joins the group. She is the most shy girl of them all who share&#039;s Nico&#039;s obsession with school idols and Love Live. Hanayo has a very kind heart, but I don&#039;t think she has a whole lot of depth from what I remember. Rin Hoshizora is the last first year and Hanayo&#039;s best friend from their childhood. Rin has the same liveliness as Honoka and has that cat-like cuteness that some anime characters have: the cute cat smile, high pitched and playful voice. Again she doesn&#039;t have a ton of depth but I still love her character as much as all of the others&#039;. <br />
<br />
VI Music<br />
	The soundtrack for Love Live! Is just... I... I don&#039;t have a large enough, or refined enough vocabulary to do the music justice. Spirited, lively, energetic, peppy, bubbly, and beautiful is the best way for me to explain the music. I&#039;m not a musical expert, I play bass guitar a little bit, and I love the music. The girls have the most gorgeous, beautiful, resonant voices that I&#039;ve ever heard and I can&#039;t get enough of hearing all nine of these adorable girls sing. Each song is so full of energy that I want to start dancing with them, even though I&#039;m a guy. On another note, I mainly listen to heavy metal, thrash metal, metalcore, hard rock, and classic rock but I love Muse&#039;s songs just as much as I love AC/DC, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Avenged Sevenfold, and Disturbed. If that doesn&#039;t say something about how amazing these girls are, then I don&#039;t know what does. The lyrics aren&#039;t as shallow as I thought they would be. The lyrics aren&#039;t very deep at the same time, but it&#039;s not easy to have deep lyrics for a peppy school idol group and keep the songs and performance entertaining and lively, now is it. I regret my lack of musical expertise and knowledge of musical jargon; I can&#039;t give Muse&#039;s musical talent the justice it deserves, so please go and check out the songs available on YouTube or watch the anime yourself so you can experience this amazing work of art. <br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
	I give Love Live! School Idol Project an 11/10 for its beyond outstanding ability to spread cheerfulness, the amazing and lovable characters, the jaw dropping animation sequences and the spectacular music. Love Live! Receives the Pandas Seal of Approval, a gold medal, and the #1 spot on my top ten favorite anime list. I would highly recommend this to anyone, of any age, because of how open it is to everyone. The second season is currently airing and episode 8 is scheduled to be released within the upcoming week.

    &quot;Love Live! School Idol Project&quot;, I have never fully watched any idol series before, so this one was my first, and I ended up enjoying it a lot. I&#039;ve tried to watch IdolM@ster when it first aired, but I just couldn&#039;t get into it. I watched Love Live after it was finished airing. I honestly don&#039;t know why I decided to watch Love Live, but I&#039;m so glad I did.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
There was a clear story, which was good. School is gonna get shut down if they don&#039;t get enough students, Honoka (main character) decides to become school idols to stop the school from closing. The story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review102503">
        was simple, and I didn&#039;t have any problems with the pacing. Throughout the show, they include showing what the characters need to endure to become idols which include stamina, vocal, and dance training. I thought that this was a nice toutch to include and helped with character development quite well<br />
<br />
Art/Animation<br />
I liked the overall art style, which fit the mood of this series, it was bright and colorful. But the one thing that I didn&#039;t like was the CG&#039;s. Luckily, they were only used during the insert songs and in the opening. They didn&#039;t use CG&#039;s for the whole song either, it switched between several times, sometimes, the CG wasn&#039;t too noticeable, which is why I didn&#039;t mind it too much. The animation looked smooth and was very well executed. No complaints about animation. I loved the choreography during the songs, sometimes, I had to rewatch one of the performances twice. Once to focus on the song, and another to look at the choreography.<br />
<br />
Sound/Music<br />
Being an idol anime, I guess I kinda expected good music. I am glad to say that I was not disappointed. All of the songs were catchy, memorable and fit the situation very well. Even the background music stood out to me (in a good way). It always fit with the events that happened and set the tone of whats gonna happen. The opening song was amazing, I never skipped it, not a single time. The ending song was the same, never wanted to skip it.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
Each character had a very different personality and were all likeable in their own way. There weren&#039;t any characters that I hated. I found that I could summarize the personalities of the characters in just a few words, which isn&#039;t necessarily bad. The characters had a very human like mindset in my opinion, which enhanced the drama scenes in the show.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
I really liked this anime and am glad that I gave it a go. I have never fully watched an idol anime before this one. When I was watching, I was completely immersed in the show. I never felt bored or wanted to skip over a scene during the show. The music was amazing, I cannot stress that enough. If you haven&#039;t watched this, I highly recommend that you give it a shot.

    So, you want to become a superstar? <br />
<br />
It&#039;s not easy. In fact, it takes more than just skill. It takes the will, determination, support, technique, integrity, and a little bit of luck to reach success. In fact, reaching that point of success is especially hard when there&#039;s competition. Among other things, being an idol also means to shine and make yourself a name in the industry. You have to embrace what you do and no matter what, always aim for success. <br />
<br />
At least, that&#039;s what the girls at Otonokizaka High School wishes to do...<br />
<br />
Alright, this series known as Love Live! School Idol Project is actually

          <span style="display: none;" id="review91841">
        an anime project co-produced with the music company Lantis Co., Ltd and studio Sunrise being involved. Not many people may know of the franchise but it already has achieved success in other fields of music CDS. Well, success doesn&#039;t come easy like I mentioned before and in this series, it definitely is something that&#039;s hard to achieve. <br />
<br />
At first I was skeptical whether to check out this series or not. I mean, there are so many idol themed series already in the anime industry. Hell, even this Winter season of 2013, there is not one (Akb4OO8 Next Stage) but two (Akitasu) ongoing series involving music and idols. In fact, I sometimes get bored of watching this stuff because initially, I thought the show would just be about cute girls doing cute things. I wasn&#039;t too wrong either especially with our main female protagonist, Honoka Kosaka. <br />
<br />
Just look at her, she&#039;s a cute little button with a cute little bang on the side of her head along with that bubbly personality.<br />
<br />
However, beyond that outer image is a girl who is determined to prevent the shutdown of her beloved school. How? Form an idol group of course! But that&#039;s a lot easier said than done in reality. The series takes this idea and transform it into a more of a slice-of-life story in the beginning. At first, there&#039;s Honoka. Then later comes the rest of the characters, or rather girls who all becomes associated with the group. Oh and the group is called Muse represented by the &quot;μ&#039;s&quot; symbol. Obviously, it&#039;s a reflection of what the group stands for – a music ensemble of girls who wishes to show the world who they are and make a name for themselves while at the same time to prevent the destruction of their beloved school.<br />
<br />
Thus, their journey begins...<br />
<br />
The initial episodes (first half of the series) makes prominent highlights of some of the other girls in the series. Among these girls, they all have different personalities. There&#039;s the timid girl with the stage freight (Umi Sonoda), the cool chick (Nozomi), the tomboy (Rin Hoshizora), the cold heart (Eli), the gentle girl (Kotori Minami), and the childish (Niko Yazawa). Of course, I&#039;m not naming all the characters here but you get the idea. From the initial premise of becoming superstars, these girls come together. However, I find the first of the episodes in this series to be dull and not done right. In fact, I find most of the girls&#039; backgrounds to be stale and lacks any real characterization besides who they are. Perhaps the lack of a general background with the girls is the weakness here but regardless, the first half of the series is a bit mediocre in my book. Well, thanks to Niko, I did have some fun and enjoyed part of her performance. NIKO-NIKO smile~<br />
<br />
However, the series becomes more lively later on especially with Honoka. I will say right now that her mood brightens this series quite a bit and can easily bring a smile to a viewer&#039;s eyes. If you&#039;re having a bad day, just watch her and that cloud of grayness will brighten. That&#039;s probably a weak analogy but her enthusiasm is what unites the group she works so hard to create. In fact, as the unanimous leader of the group, it is up to Honoka to save the school and make a name for themselves with the face of music. Perhaps, I feel she tries too hard though. I mean, in one episode, she particularly puts her own life at risk. It&#039;s how hard she tries to bring their ranks together especially when going up against competition. That&#039; s the thing too because when you become a superstar, expect media attention and rivals heading your way. It&#039;s a tough, tough world Honoka-chan.<br />
<br />
The story of the series remains weak but simple. It&#039;s about a group of girls coming together united as a music group to bring media attention. By becoming idols/superstars, they can spread their names and hopefully with what they can achieve will save their school. As simple as it is though, it is VERY easy to guess who will join Muse. It&#039;s not even foreshadowing but rather given directly with the opening song and poster. The series also doesn&#039;t avoid the typical &quot;beach episode&quot; that seemingly becomes one of those relaxing break. Furthermore, the seemingly focus on the idols themselves rather than what they hope to achieve becomes a backstabber in my opinion to the initial premise. Also, it seems that the competition isn&#039;t as intense as it originally looked. <br />
<br />
Despite this though, I find the series to be a fun and entertaining watch with a cherry atmosphere. It&#039;s nice to see the girls tries so hard on a profession that is extremely difficult to make a name for. But what they&#039;re doing it for is not only for themselves but to save their beloved school. Now that my friends is what I call good-hearted. The performance themselves are also quite real and done well. In fact, some of the songs played in many of the episodes has that idol-like feeling. With those cute outfits, personalities, and outfits, these girls really do have what it takes. <br />
<br />
In terms of visuals, Sunrise does them. And hey, who knew, they actually pulled a nice one out of their hats this time. From the outfits, character designs, and the way the girls dances, the visuals almost feel like they are coming to life at many occasions. I find this to be quite pleasing and interactive to watch as opposed to some CGI movements or forced movements. No, it&#039;s natural and the girls are putting on a live show. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack, music, and voice acting is perhaps the most prominent feature of this series. After all, music is the main feature and premise of Love Live! The sound director, Yukio Nagasaki puts effort through and it&#039;s easy to hear and visualize what it&#039;s there. Of course, the performance that I mentioned before are also done beautifully. It looks natural, realistic, and the girls have fun doing it. At some occasions, viewers may wish they were right there with them on the stage. Then opening song, &quot;Bokura wa Ima no Naka de&quot; by μ&#039;s is performed by the idol group themselves and shows to the audience that they&#039;re serious about what they do. The many ED songs brings together a collage of various fun tunes featuring different mood settings. It&#039;s beautiful~<br />
<br />
Overall, this underrated series is worth some time to invest into. In my opinion, this show is charming and so is Muse. Although its initial episodes were like a chore to watch, it later makes it up with the enthusiasm of the group along with the all cheerful Honoka-chan. It&#039;s also fun to watch the girls perform and hope that they succeed especially when they see some results on what they worked so hard for. Yup, they are aiming for success but at the same time having fun while doing it. Well, I hope you have fun while you relax, sit back, and enjoy what Muse do their best:<br />
<br />
Entertain you.

         After watching &quot;Wake up Girls&quot; and listening to plenty of idolm@ster songs, I decided I had a weak spot for idol shows.  I just finished watching NHK and as I usually like to do, switch off to something light before picking up another heavy show.  <br />
     This being said I never had high expectations of Love Live and knew from the start that it was going to be mediocre and that I was just along to satisfier a cute craving. At first things looked good, with the show making me laugh at several points

          <span style="display: none;" id="review162361">
        and a couple characters actually being somewhat appealing. <br />
      Hoever as the show goes on, it is clear that things get stale. What was once at least a sugary sweet piece of candy loses its charm. The class mate boob grab gag get&#039;s overused, one character is literally a cat, and most saddening of all, the music is kinda meh when compared to other tracks I have heard come out the Love Live project. The show even resorts to reusing an old mediocre song as a finale. <br />
     I ended up disappointed that even though my moe craving was served, I feel as if it left a bitter taste ini my mouth.

    I swear to god, when I tell you this anime changed my life I mean it. It quite literally opened my mind to finding out who I am, introduced me to idol culture, made me realize I was a lesbian, and allowed me to get into a workout regimen all at once. Outstanding writing, character arcs, relatable cast, and adorable character design. Although some of the choreography is kinda lazy, I don’t even care. Such a good anime, 10/10, would recommend even to someone that doesn’t like this genre. Now, although I love this anime, there is but one flaw. The Nico stans that came

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414635">
        from it. I swear to god those bitches are the most annoying ass fucks. I was watching a lyrics video for a love live song and they were talking about how cute the characters looked in the outfits and this guy has the audacity to come out of his greasy otaku cave and say “But Nico-Nii san is the most kawaii-desu of them all!” now I do not give a flying fuck if this guy was joking or not, it still made me cringe so hard I was sent into the 4th dimension. Also, they ALWAYS have to bring up Nico wether or not the conversations about her. Anyways, let’s get to the point. The point is, although it may have some annoying ass fans, it’s still an incredible, heart-wrenching, fun, funny, emotional rollercoaster of an anime. Please watch it if you haven’t already. - Parker, signing off.

    Love Live! Is a School Idol Project, hence the name of course. I tried to get into Idolmaster, but something just wasn&#039;t blowing my skirt up.<br />
<br />
However, Love Live! Jumps into things a little bit faster and it&#039;s funny and such a guilty pleasure. It&#039;s not bad but it&#039;s not excellent either. It&#039;s something to watch to make you smile and hum along when they sing and to laugh at the characters. It&#039;s not here to blow your mind, it&#039;s an Idol anime after all.<br />
<br />
Story - 7<br />
<br />
The story is about this all girl&#039;s school (at least I don&#039;t remember every seeing any boys), Otonokizaka High School,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review86013">
        and it&#039;s going to be closed down in a few years because it&#039;s not attracting any new students. So, three students decide to start an Idol club because school idols are really popular at the time. Now with determination they are working to recruit more members and become one of the best school idol groups.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not a bad story, but it&#039;s not that big of one either. It&#039;s just a simple little thing to get the anime going. <br />
<br />
Art - 8<br />
<br />
The art is not bad in anyway. The dances are laid out very well and the characters look nice. Everything is appealing to look at and nothing makes you cringe about how poorly drawing things are. The characters are cute and all is well.<br />
<br />
Sound - 9<br />
<br />
The sound is VERY good. The singing matches the voices, by that I mean it sounds like the singing voice matches the characters voice. I&#039;m not sure how this works (pardon my fail research skills) but it doesn&#039;t sound like different singers for the characters, which is great. The sounds are catchy and sound really nice. The OST isn&#039;t bad either.<br />
<br />
Characters - 8.5<br />
<br />
I feel like the characters are lacking a bit. We know who is who and how their basic personalities are, but you don&#039;t really know much about history - SO FAR. I&#039;m caught up with the current episode and I&#039;ll update this later, but we know very little of some of the characters. Some of them we know a little more about, however it isn&#039;t much. Each character seems to have a distinct personality though, and we already have seen a tiny bit of character development.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 9<br />
<br />
I have been really enjoying this anime. I love girly things like this, it makes me feel so young again and I love singing and music. Enjoyment is hard to write about because it&#039;s how the viewer feels. I personally like watching all of the characters and their different ways, however some may feel differently.<br />
<br />
Overall - 7.5 ( 8 )<br />
<br />
I give this anime a 7.5 rating, but since you can&#039;t do that on here, it&#039;s an 8. The story is simple and kicks off the anime giving it a good start. The art isn&#039;t bad, but its not amazing either, and the characters are cute and hilarious. The sound is very nice, OST and the idol&#039;s singing and dancing. My enjoyment of this is high and the overall is decent. I say give this a shot, if you don&#039;t like it, oh well. To each his own.

    At first when someone told me about this, I been wanting to watch it for a long time… But never had the chance to because I would never make time for myself. But after I have watched it, I am regretting not watching it sooner…<br />
<br />
Story 10/10: I like this point. The story here is put in a very realistic way and even though some parts of it are not “realistic” in way, I like how the characters go with the problems that they face, and how they solve them, is something that I enjoyed seeing. The fact that they can save their school from shutting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340140">
        down by becoming school idols make me amazed on what they accomplished in the time that they are together, even when life gets tough in the background, they will always look forward in their quest.<br />
<br />
Art 10/10: Now some people might complain because this uses CGI in its songs… but really, it is not terrible. Sure, the first few ones are bad, but that is only because it was the start of the series, after a few “lives” it gets better… and now for the art is fantastic. I love how the animators were able to make the chorography to well done (In non-CGI parts). And the CG is only used in the insert songs and the OP, and only used when movements are made by the camera that require them to move in a 3D space<br />
<br />
Sound 10/10: Oh boy. The songs here is something I have heard for months before I started watching this… I most of them are catchy and they all have their theme to it… now for the OST, it is great and fits the mood every time that one is played, and also the SFX are well done… mostly anything they do has a sound to it, whether that’s someone falling, footsteps, water, type of floor, clothes, you name it, even has ambiance noise at times, which I never expected.<br />
<br />
Character 9/10: Each member has their own personal charm and touch that makes them all unique and everyway, and makes them all likeable, they took a route that was kind of cool. Taking 3 from each grade year, which is a somewhat of a risky move since, you know what happens to seniors after the school year is over… but a nice touch.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10: This is my 2nd anime that I would want to watch again, just to get the enjoyment back and have that type of happiness with them and the sadness with them…<br />
<br />
Overall 10/10: This series overall is amazing for me… It gives this sense that you are there with them, Supporting them every step of the way, and you can feel their emotions, the sadness, the happiness, etc. and you will feel connected to them, if you give yourself the chance…<br />

    So what did I think of School Idol Project... well to be perfectly honest it was surprisingly enjoyable. When I decided to watch the anime I thought of it only as a filler in between my seasonal anime grind. But on my was I mistaken. I was into the show and the Idols performances! Whenever they where getting hyped for a show I felt that same energy! I wanted to grace the stage with Honoka, Rin, You (my fav and the BEST obviously) and all the other Idols. The art and story were not the best but for me it&#039;s all how the anime makes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354812">
        me feel and wow did this anime make me feel great! Also, I listen to all there music on Spotify and YouTube soooooooo yeah. <br />
<br />
On a side note, I play all the games and love all of them!<br />
On a side side note, Roselia is the best group and I know I&#039;m right.

    “You can’t fool television viewers with dancing girls and flashing lights” - Bob Barker<br />
<br />
If there’s any pop culture entity that can dispute Mr. Barker’s claim, it is the idol genre. Prizing style over substance, flair over functionality, and pizazz over practicality, titles within the idol genre have discovered success time after time by appealing to its fanbase more than anything else. Unfulfilled character arcs, glacial pacing, stale voice acting, and even gaping plot holes can all be negated by the lavish concerts and energetic score from your standard idol anime. That’s not to mention the miracles that a moe pop idol can conjure; there are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review261891">
        few tactics with greater financial success than inserting as many cute anime chicks into your show as possible. The idol genre has proven again and again that you really can fool viewers with dancing girls and flashing lights.<br />
<br />
It is in this genre that Love Live has established a name for itself. Produced by Sunrise (Cowboy Bebop, Code Geass), Love Live (or “LL” for short) has developed into the biggest and brightest star of the idol genre, its massive fan base and overwhelming merchandise serving as major influences for its fame. Love Live is widely considered to be the greatest anime of its particular category, if not necessarily a critical darling. However, Love Live’s lofty status raises a few interesting conundrums: if titles within the idol genre are, by and large, bereft of depth and meaning, then how is one supposed to properly determine which is the greatest? Why should Love Love be considered the ideal representative of the idol genre? Do Love Live’s characters display more elaborate dances than that of Aikatsu? Does LL possess a greater sense of humor than The Idolmaster? I figured that actually watching Love Live would answer my questions so that’s what I did. To be perfectly honest, I harbored a few misgivings about Love Live, mainly that it&#039;s nothing more than meme fodder. However, the optimist in me believed that Love Live would be far more than that. With its charming story, LL would not only soothe my heart but inspire me to espouse its virtues as well.<br />
<br />
While Love Live didn’t exactly confirm my worst fears, it is hardly a series that I’d recommend. My opposition to LL doesn’t stem from hatred or disappointment; rather, it is generated from the show’s lackluster execution of its most basic requirements. I’m more than willing to condone a mishap or two in the visual department but a grocery list of logical fallacies, one after the other, is something else entirely. For example, your show might have a problem when your story struggles to formulate a raison d&#039;etre. Love Live is focused on three friends (Honoka, Umi, and Kotori) that desire to prevent their school from closing down but, beyond their adoration for it, they never clarify why they want to save it. If our protagonists are unaware of their cause for concern, why should I be invested in what they’re doing? Anywho, the trio agree that forming a school idol group is the best course of action (because why should you start donations and petitions when you can sing for a great cause?) but first they have to be approved by Eli Ayase, the Student Council President that’s overly harsh towards our aspiring heroines.<br />
<br />
Will our main trio find a concrete purpose for saving their school?<br />
Will Ayase change her dastardly ways?<br />
Will Love Live start caring about itself?<br />
<br />
These questions will be answered right after Love Live exposes you to the umpteenth shot of Honoka’s butt.<br />
<br />
At its core, Love Live is a show that panders like no show has ever pandered before. Not only is there an obligatory beach/swimsuit episode but there’s also the rampant fanservice (especially early on), as well as an unbearable “chest grab” gag (it has to be seen to be believed). Couple that with Love Live’s excessive moe aesthetic (the sparkly eyes, the constant blushing, and the unnatural wiggling/squirming) and top it all off with the bizarre scene in episode 11 where a friend of Honoka’s rubs her head and scratches her chin like Honoka is some sort of dog. What you’ll get is one phenomenal crowd-pleaser of a show, a show that prefers to satisfy fetishes rather than concern itself with storytelling. The flimsily constructed plot accomplishes little beyond serving as an elaborate excuse to showcase the cuteness of Love Live’s characters; the cast is nothing but a hodgepodge of stereotypes. Outside of Honoka, Umi, Kotori, and Ayase, there’s the athletic one (Rin and her “nya”s), the intense rival (Nico and her ridiculous poses), the shy one (Hanayo and her idol obsession), the tsundere (Maki)..... and Nozomi, the Student Council Vice President that perpetrates the aforementioned “chest grab” gag (I’ve never seen a VP constantly undermine the President quite like Nozomi does in LL).<br />
<br />
It will be of little surprise to you when I say that most of Love Live’s characters are inessential. Ayase and Kotori, however, are crucial to a certain extent but it’s Honoka and Umi that are the true outliers. Honoka is Love Live’s protagonist, a spontaneous do-gooder cut from the cloth of the spunky girl trope. What truly defines Honoka as a character are her over-the-top speeches (those bits of dialogue are downright painful in the amount of vapid positivity they exude) and her overwhelming ego (we’ll get to that later). Umi, on the other hand, is Honoka’s foil; she’s literally the only LL character with common sense, a realistic approach, and a complex personality. As Honoka’s best friend, Umi desires to aid her friend in achieving her dream but is, at first, adamantly against Honoka’s idea of an idol group because Umi rightfully doubts the effort that Honoka applied to it. Over time, Umi softens her stance on Honoka’s idea and of idol groups on general, even to the point where she valiantly defends the existence of idols in a climatic scene. On a surface level, Umi appears to be the stereotypical “quiet one”, that and nothing more, but she quickly endears herself as she wages war against her anxiety, her timidity, and the mob mentality that is an all-encompassing presence in Love Live.<br />
<br />
Honoka lords over Love Live with an iron fist; there isn’t a single character in any medium, animated or not, that wields as much creative control as Honoka. If there’s one thing that you simply must know about Love Live, it’s that this show is gravitated entirely towards what Honoka desires and anyone that deviates from it is severely punished. Honoka advertises her viewpoints as essential for success and for the betterment of others but it’s obvious that she&#039;s only massaging her ego. For example, Umi wants to perform in concerts with a knee-length skirt (for several logical reasons) and, while any true friend would respect Umi’s wishes, Honoka, with Kotori’s help, secretly created skirts of shorter length. When Umi discovers this act of treachery, she&#039;s understandably upset but Love Live more or less remains loyal to Honoka’s scheme. It’s all very sickening; Honoka is this lionized ringleader of debauchery and deceit with the overarching narrative and Kotori as her partners in crime (Kotori is the ideal yes-man for Honoka; she possesses very, very few individual thoughts or opinions, existing only to blindly support Honoka). The in-universe benefits that Honoka receives from LL are simply absurd; she’s hailed as the idol group’s leader despite not proving herself as one, she’s praised for her unreasonable badgering of potential members, and her excessive pettiness is rarely admonished. The moments where Honoka is called out on her BS, like Ayase pointing out her arrogance or Nico questioning Honoka’s leadership, are so, so refreshing but they are few and far between. Is it too much to expect LL to treat its characters with fairness and rationality?<br />
<br />
Buried deep within Love Live’s framework, beneath Honoka’s ego trip, beneath the gratuitous pandering, beneath the shallow characterization, is a redeemable project. It’s LL’s soundtrack that possesses most of this show&#039;s promise; soothing and refined, the OST is stunning in its versatility. Not only does Love Live’s score contain acoustic guitar songs and piano solos but there are also big band pieces as well. Although LL tends to utilize the same five or six songs over and over, the music is still a joy to listen to. However, when you’re not enchanted by Love Live’s score, you&#039;re left in awe by the artificiality of it all. Like a bouquet of silk flowers, there is very little authenticity in Love Live; its worldview is far too picturesque, too quixotic, for its own good. In the world of Love Live, conflicts are resolved entirely through dogged persistence, flashbacks galore, BS logic, and the power of friendship. Any chemistry issue within the idol group is negated by the characters constantly complimenting one another. “You’re the best!” “No. I’m not that special. YOU’RE the best.” NO; YOU’RE THE BEST!” I’m almost positive that roughly 70 percent of Love Live’s script is composed of exchanges like that.<br />
<br />
When Honoka’s idol group wish to compete in the School Idol Tournament, the school director allows them to do so, no questions asked. She doesn&#039;t explain to them the financial costs of this decision to them nor does she schedule a meeting with their parents and teachers to determine whether or not this course of action is wise. If you thought that was an egregious example of a show bypassing logic for the sake of moving the plot forward, then, boy, do I have news for you. Love Live managed to land the jackpot in logical fallacies twice during the same episode. The first was the aforementioned example with the school director. The second? Well, allow me to explain. The director has permitted Honoka’s group to participate in the School Idol Tournament only if everyone within the group lands a passing grade on an upcoming test. Because of this, everyone is diligently preparing for the big day, with Umi, Kotori, Maki, Hanayo, and Nozomi tutoring the academically challenged members of the group, specifically Honoka (she possesses the intellect of a second grader despite being in high school because of anime logic). After everyone finishes their test, the idol group members convene to share their scores with one another. They quickly discover that every member passed; however, Honoka hasn’t shared her score with anyone. As the group begs her to reveal her grade, a few members express regret that their efforts will be worthless if Honoka failed. It is right then and there that Honoka dramatically unveils the graded test that was concealed behind her back. With the inspiring orchestral strings blaring in the background and a larger-than-life grin plastered on Honoka’s face, her graded test is revealed…. to have a score of 53.<br />
<br />
I would like to note that, in Japan, a 53 is a failing grade, just like it is in the rest of the world.<br />
<br />
As far as acts of stupidity are concerned, this was simply breathtaking. That Love Live treated Honoka’s score like some sort of grandiose achievement is not only absolutely hilarious but it’s quite perplexing as well.<br />
<br />
What was the criteria for passing? To answer correctly more than half of the questions?<br />
Did the teachers accept Honoka’s test as a passing grade because he/she pitied Honoka?<br />
Was the teacher bribed by Honoka’s parents to pass her?<br />
<br />
Now that I’m thinking about it, I know exactly why Honoka passed: because Honoka is Love Live’s protagonist and presenting her with a challenging obstacle is far beyond LL’s capabilities.<br />
<br />
During Love Live’s final three episodes, the narrative attempted something new, gravitating towards poorly handled melodrama like a moth being drawn towards a burning candle. The result was the nadir of a thoroughly average title; Love Live’s emo phase flopped because it was overbearing (especially with the histrionic soap opera that was episode 12), because it was extremely jarring (completely antithetical to a series that, up to this point, was directed towards maid cafes and pillow fights), and because it disappeared the instant that Nico ordered Honoka to stop being angsty. Amidst all of the melodrama, Love Live’s finale introduced us to the highlight of the entire series, a truly beautiful scene with Honoka and Umi reminiscing on the stage of their first concert. It reminded me of what the underrated western Justified used to excel at, simply placing two characters in a given setting and allowing its masterful script to take it from there. With the aforementioned scene in Love Live, there was no overpowering song in the background, no special effects, and no unnecessary camera angles. It was just Honoka and Umi shooting the breeze. As I was watching all of this unfold, I thought to myself, “Why couldn’t Love Live bother to do something like this before?”<br />
<br />
If Love Live really is the best that the idol genre has to offer, then I certainly won&#039;t expose myself to more of its ilk. Yes, Love Live possesses an excellent soundtrack, a lovable character in Umi, and a spark of untapped potential or two. However, that is hardly enough to deliver it from my wrath. Not only does this show have a repulsive love affair with its protagonist but it treats every other character with the utmost contempt. Not only does this show appeal to the lowest common denominator but it also insults your intelligence. Not only does this show enrage with its wasted potential but it also shoots itself in the foot with its constant tonal shifts. Vapid yet infuriating, erratic yet meandering, bewildering yet unenticing, Love Live is a jack of many trades and a master of wasting your time. Dancing girls and flashing lights cannot redeem this scrap heap of mediocrity.

    Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve probably taken note of the rising popularity and plethora of idol related anime in the last few years. Any time I dare venture out to any anime convention that just so happens to be taking place within my proximity, I’m bound to be met with an onslaught of idol related merchandise from body pillows, those strange mouse pads that also have a pair of breasts on them, figures, CDs and even several cosplayers too – it’s inescapable! However, it’s not necessarily hard to understand why such shows garner such popularity, as they seem to be almost designed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review261434">
        to be as marketable as possible. They feature an ensemble of cute girls, of various body types, whether that be the small loli (remember to tell the FBI that she is just a drawing when they come knocking down your door!) all the way to the plump and voluptuous, all the while having distinct personality types to appeal to every demographic of anime fan imaginable. Combine that with the fact that the girls are often made to wear skimpy and risqué outfits with incredibly small miniskirts, and sing generic, catchy pop-songs with their cute mannerisms, makes for a cultural phenomenon! Out of all the various idol anime out there, easily the most prolific and popular is Love Live; a franchise so popular over in Japan that in 2016 it was the highest grossing media franchise of that year, passing One Piece! (Damn, that’s a lot of scantily clad body pillows sold!) Over the last few days, me and a couple of other reviewer friendos decided to watch the entire series (for the most part anyway) all together, and while it was a very enjoyable experience to do so, even if we spent most of the time making fun of the show, I seem to have been left with rather severe PTSD, so much so, that every time I go to close my eyes to sleep at night, visions of each of the girls as they smile and dance appear in front of me. At first, it’s tranquil; calm, but as time moves along the girls become fierce and terrifying, laughing manically as I am trapped in this existential horrific nightmare in which even my own screams of pain and anguish cannot awaken me from the horrors that lay before me. I desperately want to run, to run from the visions, but I’m stuck; frozen in place as the idols slowly consume me and every fibre of my being…<br />
<br />
Anywho, with that all said and done, and instead of contacting my closest therapist immediately, let’s form our own idol group, dress up in some revealing clothes whilst dancing and singing on stage, and dive into the world of Love Live!<br />
<br />
Otonokizaku High School is on the verge of closing, due a lack of students wanting to partake in studies there, and is set to shut down after the current first year students graduate. As such, our main protagonist, Honoka, in an attempt to prevent the school closing down at all costs, decides to create an idol group, as a way to attract new students into attending said school, thus preventing it from its inevitable closure. The rest of the series sees Honoka recruit new members, as they all practice harder and harder to become great idols, intermixed with a touch of drama here and there. At the very least, Love Live’s set-up allows for some semblance of narrative stakes as the failure of the newly formed idol group, by the name of Muse, will bring an end to the school (even though we know as an audience from the get-go that the characters will succeed since there is nothing presented in the narrative that would suggest otherwise) and it also provides some kind of motivation and drive for the characters in the story. My main criticism of Love Live’s narrative is just how incredibly predictable and safe the entire journey is. It’s the most standard narrative structure one could possibly expect to see, and has been done so many times in so many other shows, that I can guarantee you that you would be able to identify each story beat and event that transpires in the show just by simply reading the plot synopsis presented on MAL. It genuinely feels like that whoever was writing the show, was simply ticking boxes off of things to include within the show. A hyper and energetic girl with good intentions who ropes everyone in and inspires them to try their hardest? TICK. An obligatory beach episode which is used for the purpose of training and seeing each of the girls in skimpy bathing suits? TICK. Drama that is introduced late into the narrative and is used more so to try and make the show seem more emotional than it is, whilst trying to manipulate the audience into feeling something for the characters, which will be ultimately resolved by the final episode leaving in a happy conclusion? TICK. As such, the narrative of Love Live feels tiering; a chore to sit through, as in my head I could easily map out the series and each one of the events that would transpire. It feels less like a journey you embark on with these girls as they try to save their school, and more so like a lecture in which you already know all the content the lecturer is going to go over, and you’re just listing them off in your head, waiting for them to get to the next point.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned before, the show does have its share of drama, which I imagine was implemented into the narrative as a way to spice things up; to try and make things interesting, but it just comes across more so forced and trite than anything else, and the juxtaposition between the light-hearted hijinks an episode before, and scenes where everyone is yelling and fighting comes across as so damn jarring! Again, just like the complaints I talked about above about the narrative’s predictability, the drama in the show is foreshadowed in such a way that ignores the very notion of subtlety. After both Umi, Honoka’s friend, and Honoka’s little sister warn her not to overwork herself as she may fall ill, she then decides to go running in the pouring rain like an idiot, develops a fever, and ends up ruining everybody’s hard work as a result. The show expects me to feel sorry for Honoka, since the very reason as to why she developed this fever was because she was working so hard to prevent the school from closing down, but I simply can’t, as the character itself isn’t strong enough to illicit such emotions in me, especially since it’s so typical of these types of shows to go down this route that it leaves no impact on me! There’s even a scene in the show where the drama reaches a point in which Honoka gets bitch-slapped into the Shadow Realm after proclaiming her leaving of the group, whereupon I promptly laughed my ass off for a good ten minutes because I’m an immature dumbass. But, this disconnect from what the show expects me to feel, that is, emotional and probably shock from seeing one of the girls resort to physical violence towards her friend, against what I felt, that is, laughter at a moment where it obviously wasn’t warranted is the reason why I feel nothing for any of the drama they try and throw in the show, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that the characters are simply not strong enough to carry it. There’s just nothing really to sink your teeth into in this show in regards to the story, and, despite what some people may tell you, such as the entire show being inside one of the character’s heads (which would actually be kind of interesting as an idea now that I think about it) there’s nothing really of any substantial merit here (then again, the person who told me that has Eli as his favourite girl, so therefore his claim lacks any weight automatically).<br />
<br />
Now, I’ve complained a fair bit about the narrative and why it feels so tiresome and dull, but this mode of storytelling is not necessarily a game breaker for me. I can forgive an anime in regards to its lack of overall narrative, as long as the characters, and the interactions between them are good; it’s the main reason why I liked Azumanga Diaoh after all. In that show, the narrative is simply about a bunch of high school girls whom progress through three years of high school, with them eventually graduating at the end, but the characters are all very likeable, to the point in which we grow attached to them as actual people, and the comedy in the show is strong enough to carry the entire experience. For me, the most important thing in most cases are the characters, since they hold the key to whether or not I care about anything the show prevents me with, and I think if the characters in Love Live were stronger, I could be more forgiving of the narrative and the whole show at large.<br />
<br />
Much like in regards to the story, it felt like the writer constructed the characters in the most safe and predictable way possible, with two exceptions however. I’ve already somewhat alluded to Honoka’s character earlier in the review; she is the girl whom has the most energy, and acts as the driving force for pushing the story forward with her optimistic outlook to any situation and is the one that gathers everyone together, acting as the inspiration for the group through her hardworking attitude. She is not necessarily a bad character, just one that is not that interesting as a whole. As previously mentioned, she does run into some drama near the end of the series, but the small amount of development she embarks on, and character arc in general is still nothing remarkable as a whole. Umi, along with Kotori are best friends with Honoka and we see little snips of their past as children, which gives their characters a little more depth, although, and, again, is nothing to remarkable. They more so play the voice of rationality to Honoka in the series, with Umi being the shy and reserved type, but ultimately firm when the time calls, and Kotori…just being an airhead I guess. Whilst in the latter part of the series, she has to make a decision regarding her future, that being whether to move to America to study costume design, or to stay being a worthless school idol, which then cultivates in some more of that lovely, forced D R A M A that I adore, it feels inconsequential in the long run, since it’s pretty obvious that she will decide to stay with her friends since shows like this have practically programmed me to think as such. <br />
<br />
Hanoyo and Rin add very little to the overall show and to be perfectly honest, I kind of forgot they were even there half the time. Rin joins the idol group just because Hanoyo does, and while Hanoyo’s reasoning for joining, that being because she wants to grow in confidence is a fine motivation to have, it’s barely developed or explored. Maki serves somewhat more to the overall story, as she can actually play the piano and sing rather well, which is then used for writing music for the group, and her Tsundere-esque personality can actually be kind of cute sometimes. Eli has somewhat more of a backstory than the rest of the girls, being that she was actually a ballet dancer in the past, which is then used to help the rest of the group and Noizoimi is one of the better characters, being as she has the most voluptuous body, and sexually harasses the other girls by grabbing their tits (if that’s not a well crafted character, then I don’t know what is). Nozomi takes on more of a mother role in the series, often dishing out random nuggets of wisdom to the girls whenever they’re in need of some, and that’s it as a whole. The characters in Love Live, for the most part, are extremely weak and cookie-cutter, so much so, that I’m struggling to even find anything to say about them. The only fun character in the entire show is Nico, and, yes, I understand at this point she is one giant meme, but she is the only character who has some semblance of a personality. She is an aspiring wannabe ideal, constantly switching between her idol persona, that being the adorably sweet Nico, with the catchphrase “NICO NICO NII!!” which me and everyone repeated so much during our watch that my PTSD is triggered every time I hear it. She’s like an antagonist in a way; the various things she does to try and prove that she is better than everyone else at various idol related things always blows up in her face, leading to some of the more entertaining aspects of the show (I also like to imagine to myself that Nico is a trap; a thought that brings me nothing but happiness).<br />
<br />
The characters and their interactions are just fine as a whole. There are times when the chemistry between them does work, most strongest being during the beach episode I made fun of earlier since the girls are just messing around with each other (and Nico gets hit right in the goddam face with a beach ball so that’s always a plus), leading into some genuinely charming and funny scenes, particularly thanks to Nico as I just mentioned before, but the show really needed a stronger cast of characters to really pull itself together. That’s not to say that the entire show is without merit however. There were some scenes that I felt were kinda alright, such as in episode three, when, after the girls put all their efforts into practising for their first idol performance, and when the curtains go up to perform, they are greeted with only a few people rather than the full room like they were expecting, but despite that, they perform on anyway. Some of the facial expressions can also be pretty funny and charming too, such as when we’re first introduced to Maki after she finishes playing her song, she looks over at the door to see Honoka clapping profusely, all the while being cross-eyed; it’s a shot that never fails to make me laugh just because of how stupid it looks. As a whole, Love Live is just really bland and nothing of that much interest really happens as a whole.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation, it’s overall pretty solid, with each girl appearing to be pretty damn cute with rather thicc thighs. I only mention the latter part due to the fact that the show has a tendency to have low camera angles, perfectly emphasising their thighs and butts (hey, I’m not a pervert for noticing this stuff, it’s the SHOWS fault for storyboarding it as such!) It does utilise CGI however during the performances scenes, which, to be perfectly fair, actually looks pretty good for CGI standards, but my main criticism is that they cut constantly between the CGI models and close-ups of with the traditional animation, and as a result, it ends up coming across as jarring; breaking the flow of both the dancing and my immersion. The music, as expected of a show all about music does the job, although I wouldn’t call it anything great as a whole. It’s generic, catchy pop that will forget about by the time the next generic, catchy pop songs comes on. Probably the only track that I really liked was Start; dash, mainly because some twat kept singing it during the Discord chat – what a strange guy that was…<br />
<br />
In conclusion Love Live is just an incredibly bland show, and, despite a few moments here and there, is mostly devoid of anything of any substantial merit. I admit that I did enjoy myself whilst watching the show, but much of that enjoyment was indicative of watching it with everyone else. I’m sure if I watched this by myself, as I did with the last three episodes, I would be bored to tears! And this is coming from someone who typically enjoys cute girls doing cute things types of shows, but Love Live’s characters are just simply not strong enough, nor are their character interactions fun enough to hold the entire show together and becomes more so a chore to watch than anything else. I think now would be a good time to clarify that I do not begrudge anyone for enjoying this show, as the tone of this review may suggest otherwise, and, if anything, I’m envious. Envious of the fact that you could find so much enjoyment in something I found to be bland at best; envious that you can genuinely get excited whenever the girls begin any of their performances. As it stands, Love Live’s popularity confuses me, and I understand that I am critiquing an entire franchise with this statement consisting of a second season (which I’ve been told is much better than this) a movie, as well a spin-off series that also has its own sequel, but as an opening to the entire franchise, it’s incredibly weak, and doesn’t inspire much desire to go off and watch the rest of the series. At best Love Live is incredibly mediocre; at worst it gave me aids. <br />

    Love Live! is fun and lighthearted, but most of the appeal comes from getting invested in the community (seiyuus, the mobile: “game school idol festival”, and the fandom in general).<br />
<br />
The school idol tournament “Love Live” and the plot of the school shutting down are not interesting by themselves, and so the show focuses on the characters. However, there are too many characters to develop so none of them end up getting developed anyway. Of the nine main cast members, Rin and Hanayo are forgettable, Maki, Kotori, Nico and Nozomi are one-dimensional, Umi and Eli are decent and the main character, Honoka, is basically just a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325313">
        shonen protagonist shoved into an idol show. Honoka is a complete airhead and just preaches loudly about friendship and idols. For a character-driven show, the characters are poorly developed and do not contribute much to the plot. Although the show is objectively bad due to the (essentially) nonexistent plot and weak characters, I really enjoyed it! It was still a fun show to watch and made me laugh a lot. <br />
<br />
Overall, the production quality is good. Despite being poorly written, the characters are cute and quirky with colorful animation to support them, and at least have interesting visual designs. The music is above average, and the seiyuus did a good job singing and voicing the characters.<br />
<br />
TLDR; Love Live! is a fun show to watch if you’re bored, and I would recommend it to new anime watchers if you’re into shows that aren’t too plot-heavy and focus more on entertainment. I wouldn’t watch it again but I don’t regret watching it either. <br />

    This show is a sad guilty pleasure of mine. I shouldn&#039;t like this, but I did. <br />
<br />
It shows what hard work can really achieve. Especially with so much competition out there. It can really motivates you to be successful. With all that aside  the show is very shallow and simple.<br />
<br />
Cute girls dancing and singing to save their beloved school.<br />
<br />
Story: Based around nine girls working to become idols and save their school. The initial story is okay, but nothing ever goes past that. The plot is weak and suffers from this, but what can you expect from a 13 episode series. The story can only

          <span style="display: none;" id="review94875">
        be comparable when you take a slice-of-life. Each episode itself has it&#039;s own story. Don&#039;t expect much from it. I simply watched it for fun, nothing more or less. <br />
<br />
Put aside potential flaws it gave a calming and easygoing atmosphere. This made the show feel comfortable. Like laying in your bed at night, nothing really changes, but it doesn&#039;t ever feel uncertain. <br />
Sorry fans of this show but I&#039;m going to give the story a 6.<br />
<br />
Art: It wasn&#039;t bad at all. I didn&#039;t even know sunrise could make this high of quality. All aspects of the girls stage, and clothing were unique and changed often. This kept me waiting to see the next outfit. <br />
Watching in HD i could tell some of the drawings during performances almost looked 3d. This wasn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing. At times it got weird to watch and i almost wished it would just stay 2d. It was more likely done because of budget.  Much better than other shows *cough cough* .<br />
Art is an 8.  <br />
<br />
Sound: I can&#039;t say much since i watched it in subbed and not many emotions were expressed through the characters. Other than that as far I could tell they fit the characters, nothing oddball my ears could hear. <br />
Who could forget about the music. Most of the songs picked were very catchy and often found myself bobbing my head.<br />
This deserves an 8. <br />
<br />
Character: This is where the show failed to deliver on. For the first couple of episodes I didn&#039;t even know Kitori&#039;s mom was the principle. By this time almost the whole group had been already established. <br />
when looking back at it most of the group was very 2 dimensional. Backgrounds never spoken, wondering even if some of the girls said a word after wanting to join Muse. <br />
Although the ones that were shown some light had different personalities. All these differences make them very lovable. You could basically read all these characters, like the back of your hand. <br />
This was very traumatizing to characters, and made it almost boring. <br />
What could be more wrong? The fact that not once did they develop really in much of a way. <br />
-The over dramatic sad scene at the end didn&#039;t prove anything.<br />
Character, gets a 5.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Like i said i really enjoyed this. Probably much more than I should have. Just the cuteness of everything kept me going. What does that say about me? I am a sucker for cute girls dancing in cute costumes. Hell Yeah! <br />
A 7 for enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Overall: Don&#039;t set goals high, at best don&#039;t set any. With that type of thinking you might like it. <br />
Their are many shows of this variety, that said the originality is near zero. I don&#039;t recommend this if you look for deep plot inducing anime. I am forewarning you that their is not one guy in this. The rest is your choice at this point, is it worth watching or not? I would respond with yes. My hormones kept me going. I conclude my official first review with a 7.

    When this show was airing I decided not to watch Love Live, because its  ain&#039;t my style however I ended up watching it because of the rhythm game app I found in a commercial.<br />
<br />
This show is really enjoyable. The art, and music were really great and I found myself somehow excited to watch the next episode (hasn&#039;t happened in a while.) Now I know I said its enjoyable, but only if you don&#039;t really think about it. (I watched while I waited for my LP to refill) <br />
<br />
The plot is a group of girls become idols to save their school. Original really, however I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review156091">
        found it extremely unrealistic because everything seemed to go the main girls way, and they all knew how to sing. Its odd seeing nine people extremely talented at singing to the point they don&#039;t need to practice. It also was really predictable, I could for see every character who joined, (you can say its because of the opening, but no. Its just predictable.) And it was all shounen anime where every enemy suddenly become friends with the main. Character. Do people even like their school that much? Why does she love that school so much? Is it because her mom went their? Why?!<br />
<br />
Art was good since it went between 2D animation and MMD&#039;s I think their called. (Though I&#039;ve seen better quality ones on YouTube.) The songs manage to make me smile and all were fully translated which was nice since I&#039;m big on lyrics.<br />
<br />
Despite this being a more anime it wasn&#039;t really moe which is odd. K-on which is a similar show I manage to love at least 2 of their characters (Mio and Azunyan) but with I didn&#039;t really like any besides Niko and that&#039;s just because I managed to relate to her ( my friends blow me off a lot.) Also the main girl everything went her way, it was seriously annoying. <br />
<br />
[Spoiler] <br />
At the end one of the girls was about to leave and the main chick goes into the airport right as she was about to board the plane (how did she get in?) And talked her into staying. (What happened to the plane ticket? You can&#039;t just stop stuf like that. Also she is seriously selfish. I&#039;ve been told I&#039;m selfish, but I&#039;m selfish in a sense that I do my own thing. I don&#039;t mess anyone else&#039;s life up. She does something she drags everyone down with her.<br />
[Spoiler]<br />
<br />
Overall I think this show needs more moe. The only reason I can see someone watching this is so they can play the rhythm game. (It isn&#039;t needed but it makes it easier to choose favorites.) The show wasn&#039;t funny, moe, or even inspirational. I don&#039;t think being a idol would be tough if you can control the weather, and have amazing talent like that, and get everything else you want. Like she screamed at the rain to stop and it did! I&#039;m not even joking. Screw being a idol, be a weather girl. If I had the chance to go back in time and stop myself from watching this I probably would. Yeah watching it is enjoyable but once you get down and think about it you go into this living hell!

    I know what you&#039;re thinking...And stop it.<br />
Recently I&#039;ve been on a sort of &#039;binge watch&#039; of anime; but not just any anime, I&#039;m talking about the type with no plot, high school girls doing crazy things, minor fan service, why? Because after a tough day of college the LAST thing I want to do is put on an episode of Serial Experiments Lain, right?<br />
<br />
But what if I told you that there exists a moe idol show with so much more to offer than meets the eye? A show with so much heart, passion and hard work put into it, that it has actually bustled its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review164785">
        way into my shortlist of favorite anime of all time?<br />
Well, such an anime does exist, Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you, my review, of &#039;Love Live: School Idol Project&#039; as well as it&#039;s second season.<br />
<br />
Story - 8/10:<br />
A lot of people like to compare this anime to a little known anime known as K-On! , but in reality, Love Live is so much more.<br />
Our main character, Honoka Kousaka, finds out that her beloved high school will be shut down next semester due to poor application rates, and discovers the reason for this is because of a brand new high school called &#039;ITX&#039; which is home to Japan&#039;s biggest school idol group known as &#039;A-RISE&#039;.<br />
Naturally, Honoka sets herself with the goal of creating her own idol group, not to rival the behemoth that is A-RISE, but to simply keep her school relevant for another year. From then on, we journey with Honoka through the trials and tribulations, hard work, and sad moments everyone must go through to finally see their goals come to light.<br />
Personally, my only &#039;problem&#039; with the pacing of K-On! Was just how seamlessly quick and easy a group of moe blob ditzy girls became a famous girl band, no emotion, nothing. On the other hand, even the latter third of Love Live&#039;s 3rd episode comes filled with sadness, helping you understand what it is you&#039;re getting into, and for that, I am thankful.<br />
<br />
Art - 10/10:<br />
I just...<br />
Okay, it&#039;s pretty much standard fare that every idol has to look vastly different to the others in order to check off the anime girl stereotype check list and appeal to as many fetishes as possible - I&#039;m not into that.<br />
What I AM into is great ANIMATION, and Love Live does not let me down on that part! You can expect some sort of high production value from a studio like Sunrise  but this was just ridiculous. Each and every scene looks beautifully colorful, vibrant, and all round pleasant to look at, but where the animation goes above and beyond is during the performance scenes; masterfully executed scenes of CGI inter-spliced in between animated frames make the choreography look unbelievable, arguably the best and most appropriate use of CG in any anime ever.<br />
<br />
Sound - 10/10:<br />
As I stated in my previous review, I&#039;m fluent in both English and Japanese; and therefore I can give a more accurate viewpoint on the dub than others who don&#039;t blah blah blah.<br />
We&#039;ll start off with the voice acting. As it stands, there is no English dub, and for a show like this, I don&#039;t think there will ever be one, every character is voiced by their real life counterpart which I thought was a nice touch, and so I don&#039;t think anyone can criticize the choice of voice acting.<br />
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, the music, ah yes, the music!<br />
My god.<br />
Basically, all you NEED to know is that the singles they used for the anime was perfection, and each song kicks major ass, a song is rarely ever repeated in the same season which means you get fresh off the batch music nearly all the time.<br />
<br />
Character - 10/10:<br />
NICO NICO NII~<br />
The series has a mere 26 episodes to fully develop and extract emotion from 9 whole main characters, which averages out at less than 3 episodes per character, but you know what? Even though characters like Hanayo and Rin don&#039;t even get that many episodes, their stories are all beautifully executed, some even managing to force a tear from me.<br />
The one character that I felt wasn&#039;t developed as well as I would have liked was that of my favorite girl in anime, Nico Yazawa.<br />
You see, you see small flashbacks of how tough her life has been, such as a brief 5 second time skip of all of her club members leaving her to be alone for the entirety of her high school life, and I&#039;m sure some of us here know how tough THAT is.<br />
I wish some things were better explained, but what we did get was beautiful, and managing to do what they did with such a large cast was a masterstroke.<br />
<br />
Overall - 9/10:<br />
This show caught me off guard, I wasn&#039;t expecting to got what I got at all, a show with so much more than it&#039;s genre will let off, a show that leaves pretty much every other music-based anime in the dust.<br />
What Love Live accomplishes is a heart-warming story of friendship, hard work, failure, perseverance and most importantly, passion. The characters aren&#039;t just cardboard cut-outs, however some of the things they do and say can be somewhat cheesy.<br />
This show is not perfection, however. As I mentioned, the story is very basic, and while it does expand upon it&#039;s initial goal, I still feel like there is more to come, and more that could have been done, in a story with 9 girls who successfully played with my emotions.<br />
Watch it.<br />
Love it.<br />
Never regret it.

    I&#039;m a big fan of the Love Live franchise, so I&#039;m sorry if I look like a mired person or with bad judgment, but the truth is that I like all seasons of Love Live (including Sunshine and the movie). But that does not stop me from wanting to give my opinion about this anime.<br />
<br />
History:<br />
Love Live is an anime that does not have a deep, ingenious or innovative story. This does not make this point weak or anything like that, the series creates a simple story for the characters to &quot;develop&quot; the way they see fit. The story is developed based on training and training

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280660">
        until you can perfect a choreography. The story is not more than that, a day by day of 9 girls who give their best effort to achieve a goal, but it is more than that, the events that arise in history make it good in my opinion.<br />
<br />
There are moments like the first concert they do that showed me how serious the girls were, the story does not want them to be the best ones singing automatically or because they are school idols stand out in a first concert, that&#039;s why the first concert was a total disaster (although Star Dash is one of the favortias songs of the fans), because it has to be, a group of idols is not done from one day to the next, that would be totally illogical. Although the time spent in choreography, costumes and calling people for the concert was totally useless they did not give up, they had a credible goal and an &quot;answer&quot; to their problem also credible, it was admiracion and hard work, it has not but, at no time I find it strange that being school idols was something stupid or irrational, the world that presents Love Live makes it totally clear that school idols of that age are very normal and attract public, being a school idol is simply something that would assure (for Honoka) attract public, under that point of vsita it sounds very credible that she has been serious about being a school idol and convince her friends to do it, because that way the chances of saving the school increase significantly and, something that I consider important even in real life, they could turn their responsibilities into something special and very comfortable for them.<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Characters:<br />
The characters (along with the music) is what gives Love Live the essence, since the main objective of Love Live was always to produce good music and create very &quot;beautiful and tender&quot; characters to make the aesthetics of music have cohesion and so make both components are in a way that the public likes and can make any of the 9 girls in the group are liked by someone. And the 9 girls together form the group u&#039;s<br />
<br />
The Love Live characters share the same goal or main objectives as the others, this is something that is obvious taking into account that all live in the same school and that same school will close.<br />
<br />
Honoka Kousaka: she is a character who has the character of a boss, not because of being bossy or being a kind of drastic boss, she is simply determined and cheerful, which I like, is like what I said before; she transforms her responsibility into a way to get closer to her friends and a way to have fun. Honoka is the typical person who is always happy and knows how to make her group happy, and there is the grace of the characters, to take types of people to make a group of idols more diverse and with different and at the same time similar personalities. Honoka works very well as head of the group, I do not have much more to say about her; She is friendly, kind, often funny and very determined to fulfill her goals (although in a certain part of the Honoka series she became very depressed and left the group for a while). Simply a character with good function of boss and who manages to become more responsible in the second season to be president of the student council, so she learned to tormase more seriously their responsibilities.<br />
<br />
Umi Sonoda: is the typical girl who is good at sports and academically, Umi is the childhood friend of Honoka and Kotori, so their closeness with both characters is very present in the series, Umi despite being another type of common girl in animes does not take away the merit, this is due to his participation in the group and his way of helping the group.<br />
Umi is a very shy girl who dislikes wearing mini skirts for concerts, but due to the insistence of her best friends she decides to put on the clothes she thought was shameful, Umi demonstrates in the first instance to be a good friend and shows it With all the other girls that join the group, Umi is a character that is distinguished from the other characters because of how indecent finds things like kisses or that indole, this causes pretty funny moments in the series (like when they are watching a novel), Umi has a very strong personality and fulfills his goal of trying to be different from the other characters (although it looks like Maki, they turn out to be very different), it shows the love that has Honoka and Kotori for be childhood friends,and Umi likes to practice archery.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kotori Minami: she is in charge of the creation of the costumes for all the concerts, so it can be said that she is one of the most important in the series. Kotori shows (just like Umi) the affection she has for Honoka, I emphasize this because it is very important, it would not make sense if they are friends from childhood and they do not show a credible friendship for what they have been together, their friendship It has to be made credible, this is achieved through their friendly dialogues and the memories they have of their childhood (especially the one that show a time when they climb a tree and Kotori and Umi scares them), I consider the friendships of these 3 girls very well achieved, many people may say that cliche, but that is irrelevant, taking into account that the story tells the day to day of a group of idols and adding the fact that they are normal people is a cliche well implemented, is that they simply showed their relationship in a simple way as people in their day to day, the moment that Kotori has to go proves it even more, Honoka gives all their effort to convince Kotori to stay in Japan , And it is Kotori has other motivations besides saving the school, she wants to be a designer, that would give her reasons to join the group of idols. Kotori is the personage of the series that demonstrates to have more motivations in addition to saving the school and it is possible to appreciate his great friendship with Umi and (especially) with Honoka. despite that she does not have a personality &quot;as&quot; marked as the other girls, Kotori is more responsible and somewhat more shy than the others (she is almost as responsible as Umi), but what differentiates her from the others are her goals and things what she does (make the wardrobe, want to be a professional designer and be a kind of &quot;maid&quot; in a local).<br />
<br />
Rin Hoshizora: Rin is a first year at the Otonokizaka academy, it is one of the smallest members of the group, it is often childish (but without falling into stupidity imensa). Rin is quite extravaganten his mania to finish his sentences with &quot;nya&quot; also comes to be a type of girl known in Japan (come on, the typical &quot;Neko girls&quot;), so they did the right thing by making Rin the most childish member and the smallest of the group, because although it is unnatural to listen to someone finish the sentences with nya, the series wants this to go more unnoticed and not feel forced, this because the series does not give emphasis to its strange mania to say nya, so if someone came to dislike it would be very easy to ignore.<br />
Rin is also one of the members of the most sensitive group (only surpassed by Hanayo) and that is noticeable since she was little, because she was annoyed to look like a man, which caused a constant denial when talking about her beauty, even saying that She was not pretty enough to be able to enter a group of idols, it&#039;s not a traumatic past or anything like that, it just caused her great insecurity, the bad thing is that it may seem quite exaggerated. Rin manages a good relationship with almost everything (if not all) the group, this is because she always tries to have fun and it feels good to have that support in the group, it is as if she often raised spirits (despite the fact that she often gets sad), but she proves to be mature when she has to be mature (especially when she had to be the center in a song).In spite of everything, it takes time for Rin to find a real reason to belong to the group, since she joined the group only because Hanayo did it.<br />
<br />
Hanayo Koizumi: she is the most timid member, that is the basis of her main charm, we must give special emphasis on her shyness, because that is what stands out the most.<br />
Hanayo has several good relationships with Maki and Rin (those of her school year), Hanayo had a great affection for school idols, even she was one of the few that came face to face in the first concert of the u&#039;s (since all the others were hidden). Hanayo is a friend of Rin since they are small, that is why they are always together and that several times they meet together, often both find themselves progressing to be better school idols, but that is not why Hanayo does not have good relations with the others members, Maki is someone who can hit Hanayo a lot in terms of personality, but that does not distance them or anything like that, both, being first year, they get along very well, it is natural that in Love Live the members that belong to the same year get along, because they have the same class in common, but outside the school, Hanayo still gets along well with Rin and Maki, Hanayo being shy does not speak much, but with Maki and Rin speaks a lot, that She already says a lot about her relationship as friends.<br />
After a while, when Hanayo gets used to doing concerts, she changes her attitude and does not feel ashamed to sing and dance in front of many people, on the contrary, seeing things from her in stores is joyful and emotional, so in the story could leave his shyness aside<br />
<br />
Maki Nishikino: she is very mature, has different hobbies than other members since she knows how to play the piano and is often busy as a resource to make songs, Maki is intelligent, but despite that she believes in things that are childish at her age (Maki believes in Santa), but that does not make her silly, obviously. Maki is the daughter of a millionaire father, although this does not have much relevance in the series it has to be said that at a certain moment the u&#039;s go to the summer house of Maki&#039;s parents to spend some time (it must be said that in that part they occur many fun moments).<br />
Maki also has a great relationship with (besides her school year) Nico, Maki often has funny conversations with Nico because she can turn out to be very crazy, is how Rin, despite that Maki never says he dislikes being with Nico and Len at certain times are treated very well as friends, Maki manages good control of their friendships.<br />
a very remarkable attitude of Maki is that it seems &quot;tsundere&quot; and in a moment even Nozomi tells him a comment of that type to laugh at her for a while. This attitude causes that Maki often reacts of graceful form or that says phrase that, at least the fans, consider memorable<br />
<br />
Eli Ayase: is the president of the student council and one of her first actions in the series is to ban the group that Honoka was planning to do, and at the beginning Eli demonstrates an absolute denial of the formation of the idols club, but through the story advances and due to the determination shown by Honoka, Eli decides to help the group so that they can dance well, Eli changes her mind in a way that is well constructed, she simply decided to help the last hope of her high school (since she was the president then logically it was the most worried).<br />
Eli has a very good relationship of friendship with Nozomi, the viscepresident of the student council, Eli knows Nozomi since they are small and in short, it happens the same as with the other members, when they know each other since childhood their friendship is very well achieved and demonstrates in a very credible way, especially by the way they help at certain times.<br />
Eli also has a more firm and responsible personality, she is not strict (the strict one of the group is Umi), but she often shows her great concern for the group, even though at the beginning she wanted to prohibit the club of idols<br />
<br />
Nozomi Tojo: is undoubtedly the wisest and smartest member of a group, even before joining the group of idols she helped giving advice, as I said, Nozomi has a close relationship of friendship with Eli since they are small, but all members of u&#039;s have a lot of respect for Nozomi, that&#039;s not why they have a more formal relationship, but they do estimate it a lot (in a chapter Maki finds out about Nozomi&#039;s past and feels that she can get along better with her).<br />
Nozomi also has a very strong personality, as already mentioned is wise, but besides that she likes to joke with the members of the group, thus playing a good role of &quot;counselor&quot; and how a very good friend to have fun.<br />
Nozomi, has a past that is not the big thing or something deep, but it serves to better understand the reason that gets along so well with Eli, Love Live in general stands out for the relationships formed by the characters and how they are shown Throughout the series, with Nozomi they chose to use another flashback to demonstrate the beginning of their relationship.<br />
Nozomi also has the habit of grabbing other people&#039;s chest, it&#039;s weird, but when he used that it gave me grace<br />
<br />
Nico Yazawa: Nico is the member of u that most admired by the school idols has, at first part hating the group of idols saying they are mediocre, but then he has to give the club to Honoka, Nico felt the same as Eli, he disliked the fact that there was an idol club, but for totally different reasons. Nico had previously formed a group of idols that had come far and Nico was emotionally excited by the fact that his dream was becoming reality, but the other members left, because of that she denies the fact that there is another group of school idols.<br />
Nico has a more than justifiable motivation to join the group of idols, she admires the idols in the same way that Hanayo does, that is precisely why Nico and Hanayo become good friends, Nico is the most open member to express herself , she does not feel ashamed when it comes to being idols and that is noticeable when she makes her &quot;Nico Nico Nii&quot; to show that she &quot;knows&quot; to be an idol.<br />
Nico in general is more similar to Rin, both are very crazy and funny, but Nico takes his idol job very seriously.<br />
<br />
Being Love Live a series that focuses a lot on the charm of the characters is normal to try to make them more distanced in terms of design is concerned (and if it does not do so by personality). This is an excellent factor taken by the series, since, regardless of whether his personality is distinctive or not of the character, his design will make him feel more detached and special.<br />
In Love Live the designs of the 9 girls is done in a very good way, they did not try to make the designs very strange, they put an exact amount of intonation to the colors to make the hair and the eyes of a color neither realistic nor unreal.<br />
It is also worth mentioning that the characters are also distinguished by the excellent work of the dubbing actors (or seiyuus) that make the voice feel different from the other members (which was to be considered taking into account the budget behind it). ). In my opinion as far as designs are concerned, Love Live did it very well, knew how to create a nice design for the view and knew how to take advantage of the lyrics or &quot;aesthetics&quot; of their songs to make characters that in my opinion are very charismatic and distanced from others, very good characters.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Rhythm and events of the story:<br />
Leaving aside that which I just told about the ed u&#039;s members, it is also worth mentioning how to develop the story based on them, they constantly have scenes that demonstrate their passion for what they do and their bonds of friendship achieved with time together.<br />
Such ephemeral scenes as the flash-backs that have until more transcendental moments like when the u&#039;s present their first concert, all those parts are important for the plot, not only because they cause a change in the way of training or to see the work of being idol, but also because you can get to emphasize more with all the members of the group, that&#039;s why they have so many different hobbies<br />
and they get to know each other throughout the series. With everything said then you can see a very good convinacion or &quot;synergy&quot; on the part of the members demonstrating that although the work of idol is difficult, they continue to strive and continue to advance naturally, they simply combine with each other, all are different, but try to fit for the same goal, become school idols<br />
<br />
Events happen at a good speed for what is normally offered by a series that presents the day to day of a group of idols.<br />
The series is well accompanied by moments where the u&#039;s make concerts, making the soundtrack good and the series is not monotonous, there will always be a song to raise the mood at certain times.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
animation and soundtrack: <br />
How I mentioned the soundtrack is very good in the series due to how the series makes the u&#039;s have a workout and then a dance, try to make the different songs, the soundtrack of Love Live is good because that&#039;s what the series is based on, music.<br />
The animation is in CGI due to the difficulty to animate dance movements, but the scenarios in which the dances take place, the same dances that make tune with the music make it something remarkable, it is not at all an easy job to animate dances and final does not end badly. Animation is well achieved for how complex it is.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I enjoyed the series very much, it calms me a lot listening to the songs of the u&#039;s<br />
are songs presented in the anime or not, hopefully someone feels the same as I feel with this series, I do not want to sound dramatic, but it generates mixed feelings. Undoubtedly enjoy them, you will especially like if you disriutas the music and you like the characters that go more to the &quot;cute and tender&quot; than anything else, but for me no doubt Love Live fulfilled its goal<br />

    I have to admit that when I first started watching this show, I wasn&#039;t expecting a whole lot. I decided to give it a try because I had recently gotten hooked on the mobile app, but I figured that it would be little more than a feelgood story about some friends getting together and singing some catchy songs. Nothing groundbreaking, and definitely nothing too serious. Which is probably why I was so impressed by what it ended up being.<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
<br />
What I appreciated the most about Love Live was that it didn&#039;t try to pretend that the girls would be able to get up right away

        and become the top school idols in the nation. Rather than using the typical &quot;Character gets by on sheer luck and natural talent&quot; plotline, it&#039;s made entirely obvious that μ&#039;s is starting from the very bottom- The group isn&#039;t even fully formed until more than halfway through the series. The initial founding trio is shown multiple times at the beginning of the show running up and down stairs and stretching, just so that they can be in shape enough to perform. The road they take to reach their goals is a long one filled with physical, mental, and emotional hardships, and even if it&#039;s obvious to most viewers that everything will ultimately turn out well for them, it&#039;s still tear-jerking to watch them in their darker moments- and even more satisfying to watch as they gain their first fans, put on their first live performance, and slowly but steadily watching them grow not just as performers, but as a team.<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
<br />
The art style in this anime fits the overall tone perfectly- There are a LOT of bright colors, and the girls&#039; eyes are almost constantly sparkling. The animation is generally pretty beautiful to look at. The normal, everyday scenes are above average, but nothing overly special. But whenever there is a performance by  μ&#039;s (this includes the OP theme), the show upgrades its animation to a more 3D-type style in order to more fluidly portray the dancing and expressions. Those bits are absolutely stunning, even if they take a bit of getting used to.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
<br />
Of course, as an anime centered around a (school) idol group, there are bound to be some catchy songs, and Love Live doesn&#039;t disappoint on that front. Of course there&#039;s the bright OP song &quot;Bokura wa Ima no Naka de&quot; and the upbeat ED &quot;Kitto Seishun ga Kikoeru,&quot; but each episode usually has at least one insert song that μ&#039;s performs as part of the story. They&#039;re all about the same in terms of quality, which is to say that they&#039;re all really good. I&#039;m not a big enough fan of the style to listen to them on a regular basis outside of watching the show, but none of them are annoying to listen to, and they&#039;re all fitting for the mood of the show- that is to say, incredibly optimistic and, for the most part, upbeat.<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
<br />
For the most part, I absolutely loved the characters in Love Live. I have a soft spot for first-year member Hanayo, the soft-spoken girl who is extremely shy until she starts talking about her incredible, lifelong passion for idols (her best friend, the ever-energetic first-year Rin- another favorite of mine- comments that she&#039;s an entirely different person when someone brings up idols). The other first-year, Maki, was okay, but she never stood out to me as much more than a standard tsundere. The second year trio- arguably the main characters, seeing as they were the initial founders of μ&#039;s- were generally pretty likable as well. Honoka was cheerful through the majority of the series (barring one of the more dramatic episodes toward the end), Umi started off a bit frigid but quickly warmed up into one of the more well-rounded characters, and Kotori was usually pretty happy, but didn&#039;t play a very critical role until the end. As for the third years, well... they were probably some of my least favorite characters. Nico was a bit annoying (basically a second tsundere, albeit a much LOUDER tsundere than Maki), Nozomi was just sort of bland, although she did grow on me, and Eri, the student council president who is initially opposed to the very existence of μ&#039;s, was undoubtedly my least favorite character in the series. Even after she joined the group and mellowed out a bit (This isn&#039;t a spoiler, as the OP shows all nine girls together from the very first episode), I just couldn&#039;t find it in me to like her. <br />
<br />
Basically, I don&#039;t think any of the characters are particularly strong on their own. But I still gave them an 8/10, because I loved the way that they all complemented each other, and they all showed at least a little bit of growth at the end of the series.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
<br />
Based on the scores I gave this anime, I think it should be fairly obvious that I enjoyed it. The sad scenes are only sad for long enough to make the mood upswing that much more satisfying, and the happy scenes are strong because after a while, it&#039;s impossible NOT to feel something for the hardworking characters. It&#039;s an emotional roller coaster, and it&#039;s so much more satisfying than it seems like it&#039;s going to be.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
<br />
Like I said at the beginning, I got a whole lot more out of this anime than I ever expected. I would recommend giving it a watch, even if it doesn&#039;t look all that special or interesting at first glance- before I watched Love Live, I had absolutely no interest in idol-themed anime. The music bored me, and I expected it to be yet another &quot;cute girls doing cute things&quot; slice-of-life show. But it&#039;s SO much more than that, and I&#039;ve found a new favorite anime to add to my list.<br />

    This is my first review, so please bear with me.<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
The story is easy to understand. School closing down due to a lack of applicants, and three girls decide to form a school idol group to gain popularity. They name this idol group &quot;μ&#039;s&quot; and eventually end up with nine members in total. I had no problems with pacing of the story - it wasn&#039;t too slow or fast - and found each episode very interesting, making me want to watch more.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
The art is, in a word, flawless. The characters, although looking very different from one another, are all cute. In fact, I was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204447">
        once asked &quot;Who do you think is the prettiest member of μ&#039;s?&quot;. I couldn&#039;t choose. They were all beautiful in their own special ways. The one thing I wasn&#039;t a fan of was the CG used when songs were performed, but I got used to it later on.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
Because this is an idol anime, there&#039;ll have to be lots of music, right? The songs in this anime were amazing, especially the opening, &quot;Bokura wa Ima no Naka de&quot;. Normally, I would skip openings, but I didn&#039;t skip this one. Not once. The other songs were amazing too, my personal favourite being &quot;START: DASH&quot;. The songs are catchy and upbeat; it&#039;s next to impossible to dislike them.<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
There are nine members of μ&#039;s. Each of them had their own personality - and they were all lovable personalities.<br />
<br />
Honoka Kousaka: The protagonist. The one who decided to start μ&#039;s. An optimistic person who isn&#039;t scared to take risks, and her determination is what makes her lovable. Seriously, though. When she was happy, I was happy. When she was upset, I was upset. She made a perfect main character.<br />
<br />
Eli Ayase: The Student Council president who seems a little antagonistic at first, but as you watch more, you find out that she has her own reasons for seeming like this. She, at first, was against Honoka&#039;s idea of creating an idol group, but later on became the 8th member of μ&#039;s.<br />
<br />
Kotori Minami: Honoka and Umi&#039;s childhood friend. She is very caring, and has a hard time expressing her feelings because she is thinking about others as well. It took me a while to like her, because I found her weak at first, but I started liking her more after realising how kind she is, because she takes other people&#039;s feelings into consideration.<br />
<br />
Umi Sonoda: Honoka and Kotori&#039;s childhood friend and μ&#039;s lyricist. A shy girl who is always thinking logically. She is extremely modest, and isn&#039;t a fan of short skirts, but gets used to them later on. She also has a strong will. She is my personal favourite because I adore both her shyness and her strong will.<br />
<br />
Rin Hoshizora: An energetic tomboy who is a little self-conscious when it comes to wearing skirts, as she was made fun of for wearing them as a child. Rin is, in a word, adorable. Like Honoka, she is always looking at the bright side of things. She can be a little idiotic at times, but she is still lovable. How can anyone hate her?<br />
<br />
Maki Nishikino: A tsundere who is μ&#039;s composer. I normally dislike tsunderes, but not Maki. Maki is a little stubborn, but also finds it hard to admit her true feelings. She&#039;s talented at playing the piano, and is also described as being beautiful. I am someone who usually hates tsunderes, but Maki was different to all the other tsunderes I&#039;ve ever seen in anime.<br />
<br />
Nozomi Toujou: Nozomi is the Student Council Vice-President and Eli&#039;s best friend, although her personality is very different to Eli&#039;s. She helped μ&#039;s, even when she wasn&#039;t a member of the group. She&#039;s kind and wise, which is one of the reasons why I love her as a character. <br />
<br />
Hanayo Koizumi: Rin&#039;s childhood friend who had a passion for idols for a long time. However, being very shy and reserved, it took her a while to gather up the courage to join the group. Hanayo is one of the cutest members of μ&#039;s in my opinion. Her two personalities - her shy one and her &quot;ohmygodIloveidolssomuch&quot; one - are both very lovable.<br />
<br />
Nico Yazawa: Like Hanayo, Nico has a passion for idols. She is also a bit stubborn like Maki, but she is also very caring. I honestly don&#039;t see how this character can be disliked. She is definitely one of my favourites.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
I enjoyed this anime a lot. The characters were all unique and special, the art was beautiful, and the songs and story were just fabulous.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
I can easily say that this is one of the best anime I have ever watched. Seriously, the worst thing about the anime was probably the CG - and they weren&#039;t even that bad! This anime is a must watch.

    When I entered the anime community, I never thought that one day, I&#039;d come to enjoy Idol Anime - something I had long associated with the more... dedicated part of the fandom. Yet when a friend recommended this anime to me, my socks were blown so far away I reconsidered the entire Idol anime category. Love Live brings a fun story, mixed with coming-of-age plot development and an overall fantastic atmosphere and world <br />
<br />
Story<br />
While I literally just said the story of love live is excellent, I can&#039;t exactly say it for this season specifically. The world building is amazing, and the plot moves along really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354119">
        well, however, I always felt that it was always a bit too cheesy and dramatic. I&#039;m sure other watchers feel similar about this situation. Even so, the story still manages to be captivating, it positions itself so that you&#039;d know what is going to happen, but they pull enough wool over your eyes so that when the giant plot twist comes, you&#039;d spit out whatever soda you&#039;re drinking and go &quot;WHAAAAAT?&quot; I know because I did that a few times. <br />
<br />
Characters<br />
You can&#039;t have an idol anime without an idol group. And while the character development in this season felt a bit underwhelming, it all made sense when season 2 dropped. So bear with me when I say it&#039;s lacking yet complete at the same time. <br />
The 9 members of the Idol Group μ&#039;s, or Muse, each bring their own unique personality into the mix, which the anime made sure to highlight. <br />
Honoka is your classic bubbly chipper anime girl. Rushing all the way to the end without giving a damn about consequences or anything in the way. While the anime did a good job of bringing up that side of her personality, when the season&#039;s big plot twist dropped and her personality completely did a 180, I, like many other members of muse, were confused at the sudden turn of mood in the group&#039;s center singer. This is because the anime never even hinted at her having that side. Sure, we&#039;ve seen her distraught, but never like what she became at the lowest point of the season. <br />
Kotori is next. Her personality, especially through the season&#039;s plot twist remains consistent and logical, she&#039;s shy, rather quiet, and always speaks to others with a soft tone. Like a guardian angel of sorts. Of course, harboring the responsibility of holding the group together means that she often leaves many of her own feelings bottled up, and the anime did a great job exploiting and using that trait. <br />
Umi didn&#039;t quite receive as much development compared to the other 2nd years, but her slowly overcoming her skepticism and stage fright made for a very rounded, albeit short character arc. <br />
Of the first years in the group, I&#039;d say Hanayo and Maki received the most development, both of them leaving their wallflower lifestyles and learning to overcome their internal nervousness to become essential members within Muse. Rin, unfortunately, was left out of development. She remained painstakingly flat as just a cheery 1st year who likes to put a nya~ at the end of every sentence. <br />
The 3rd years also recieved substantial development, with the spotlight focused on Eli. With her overseeing the development of Muse, and eventually letting go of her strict Student Council President demeanor and becoming much more loose and affectionate with the rest of the group. Nozomi, while not receiving much development, still felt very rounded and realistic because of all the behind-the-scenes meddling she did to help Muse bloom. From giving the group their name to eventually joining the group herself, she felt like a parent who cares for her kids. This leaves Niko. She mainly serves as a guidance figure, but all of us fans know she&#039;s there for comic relief with her signature Nico Nico Nii. Other than that, though... I&#039;m afraid she remains rather flat for the reminder of the season.<br />
<br />
Art and Sound<br />
Here&#039;s the big daddy of this anime. Throughout the season we see Muse go from a new group with little experience to a firm frontrunner in the school idol industry with their own unique style. First off, we can immediately establish that Muse is unique, especially in their music style. For example, compared to rival group A-RISE&#039;s more electro theme, Muse&#039;s music is far more bubbly and cheery, while incorporating enough pop elements to be a firm head-bopper. But what&#039;s far more impressive is that with the release of each track we see steady development in Muse as a group. The easiest way to see that is to compare the two iterations of START:DASH!!! When the group just started out, you can see that the choreography, hand movements, and even the animation itself to be simple, basic, and something that a new group would totally do. However, at the end of the season, when Muse once again performed START:DASH!!! This time with a full roster and more knowledge, the choreography and dances become much more sophisticated, and while they kept the original motive, each member of the group was consistently making complicated moves and fancy patterns. You can also see the clear difference in skill by comparing the first iteration of START:DASH!!! to the OP.  It&#039;s a subtle detail, but one that makes the anime feel that much more real when picked up on. However, if you didn&#039;t pick up on that detail, the songs themselves are such absolute bangers that many of them made their way onto my weeb playlist and firmly established themselves in a corner of my playlist. <br />
<br />
Overall, I loved Love Live. It felt like a realistic anime, complete with absolute bangers of songs and characters that grab onto your heart and never let go.

So that the plot of Love Live, as i normal don&#039;t write spoilers, all i can say that the writing and flow of the story

That is all nine characters out of the way, next is presentation.<br />
Love Live! is a very colorful and brimming with life. The art style is well designed with attention to detail with it&#039;s character design. The animation is beautiful created especially the song scenes which as been designed in a different animation style to make it look more better. the character animations and facial expressions are well made and look very believable. The voice acting is great and singing is well done as seems that they had a lot of work put into them and it shows wonderfully. The music is beautifully created and some are very catchy. The topics used in the anime are well as they fit the story and don&#039;t seem out of place.<br />
Lastly, my opinion.<br />
Love Live! is one of those animes that can bring a smile to my face. i love how Sunrise has created a wonderful story what captures your attention and makes you fall in love with the characters with me loving Nozomi because how funny she is and of course her hair. The songs really makes this anime, one of my favorites to watch and i really enjoy. The animation itself shows me how much hard work has been put into this and i like to say it probably one the best looking animes i ever seen.<br />
Now for the Verdict.<br />
Love Live! is a wonderful created animes that shows you that you don&#039;t need over the top story to make a great story. The art design is beautiful created and the songs will make you fall in love with it as they have been created with a lot of care. Love Live! is one anime i can recommend anyone to watch as it can be enjoyed by all and i say one of the best animes out there.
