    Disclaimer: I’ve never exposed myself to the Working!!! franchise in any shape or form prior to watching WWW.Working!!! I picked this up when this started airing on a trusted friend’s “recommendation,” who’s somewhat of a fan of the original series. I was told by this friend that it is completely possible to watch this without any experience with the original series, and after watching all 13 episodes I can confidently confirm that statement.<br />
<br />
WWW.Working!!! is a gag anime and nothing more, so it’d seem a bit disingenuous if I graded it in any other area other than its humor. I don’t think it’s fair for people

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236452">
        to grade gag anime with “story” or “character” as a metric as so many reviewers are privy to doing. A gag anime/manga should be judged simply by one thing alone (plus or minus a few complimentary factors), and that is how funny it is.<br />
<br />
WWW.Working!!! is not funny.<br />
<br />
The reason for this is easy to point out, and it’s really the trap that dooms so many of these gag anime into failures. While the initial presentation of the jokes in the show are funny (Adachi being poisoned by Muranushi’s smile, Saiki being unable to speak Japanese, etc), as the show progresses through its 13 episodes, the same jokes end up being recycled over and over again with little variation in the premise and the punchline. While it’s endearing and charming at first, listening to the same joke gets tiring no matter how funny or cute it is to begin with. The worst abuser of this is the chocolate gag between Higashida and Miyakoshi. Not only is the initial presentation not very funny (the joke uses the tired “poisonous cooking” trope that you can find in various comedy anime like Nisekoi and pretty much any romcom) but you are forced to sit through the same variation of this joke for what feels like more than half the show. While this gag is the worst victim of this instance, almost all jokes in the series follow this main flaw to varying degrees.<br />
<br />
Part of the reason why the jokes are repeated so often in the same manner generally have to do with how inflexible they are to begin with. Each of the premises are so specific it’s honestly not surprising that the jokes couldn’t push themselves farther from their initial mold. Too often the punchline ends with the premise more than it highlights the process. Lots of comedy anime like Handa-kun tend to share a similar fate of driving a joke to the ground dude to how specific the set-up is (though some manga/anime tend to pull it off brilliantly like Kaguya). The jokes do eventually branch out in new directions, but not until the last few episodes of the series where the jokes and character are given actual development; the episodes in between are still devoid of any creativity.<br />
<br />
That’s not to say that the problem couldn’t have at least been mitigated, but unfortunately WWW.Working!!! Did not use all the tools it had in its disposal.  For example, WWW.Working!!! Boasts a wide cast of interesting and quirky characters, but instead of letting them expand their repertoire and utility, each character is inflexibly paired with another to set-up each joke. Very rarely do any of these pairs mix and exchange with each other, ruining the possibility of any creative comedy and chemistry that could otherwise have been formed. In other words, much of WWW.Working’s inflexibility I would argue comes from not diversifying itself when it had many opportunities to do so. <br />
<br />
Some jokes simply aren’t performed well either. Saiki’s inability to speak Japanese is an extremely creative and hilarious premise that could be utilized in many ways. However, the VA for Saiki can barely speak English himself, and it ruins the immersion and novelty of the joke. I will admit that I don’t know much about Japan’s VA industry, but I do know that positions for VA’s are often influenced by the status and renown of the VA (i.e. the influence of the studio that owns the VA) just as much as how much they fit the position. Now, I don’t know about the relative abundance of dual-speaking VAs, but I watched an anime that aired recently (Koutetsujou no Kabaneri) that had an English-speaking VA by the name of Maxwell Powers, so at the very least I know it’s possible to obtain such an actor to some degree. If it was possible to have an experienced dual-speaking VA hired, then the onus is on the staff for not doing their best to find the most suitable VAs for the job.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I have to say I was disappointed with WWW.Working!!! While it had a very charming and entertaining initial presentation, it suffered from lack of creativity and variance to really be worth your time. It simply isn’t consistently funny. I’d like to check out future seasons though to see what they can improve upon, since the quality of the original Working!!! from what I’ve heard suggests that a funny and effective season of WWW.Working!!! can be done.<br />

    WWW.Working!! An sequel of sorts that can be classified as a spin-off of the original &quot;Working&quot; franchise, the setting maybe in the same location (A different Wagnaria) the characters maybe new, quirky and funny. So, really, it was a spin-off since there were some parts that were the same, but there were some that were a reversal of the original. So: <br />
<br />
Storywise, I&#039;ve rate is a mediocre 5, since the genre was still the same and the gags and plot doesn&#039;t differ from the original, in fact the only thing they did was use the same stuff it has with the original and reverse it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236481">
        a little bit one example was how the main character got to work in Wagnaria, were we see Takanashi who was recruited to work in the said place cu&#039;z Popura beg him, here Higashi is the one who applied for the job, cu&#039;z of financial difficulties.<br />
<br />
Art, I gave it a decent 4, since we don&#039;t get to see any ecchi here, except of course the usual Waganaria Uniforms that the staffs wore, no quintessential Zettai Ryouki to be seen around here. Though, Kyouko&#039;s counter part Kisaki should be wearing a more professional look instead of sporting the same attire as that of her younger co workers,  it kinda makes her a cosplayer  than one of the waitresses of the restaurant. Basically I really wonder as to what the fuck is going on in the mind of this anime planner Iwakami, Atsuhiro for making Kisaki spot such attire given that she a single mom, in her 30&#039;s (I think) really doesn&#039;t fit in the setting of the anime.<br />
<br />
Sound, I gave it a Poor 3, cu&#039;z the seiyuus who did most of the characters here don&#039;t fit in anymore, given that they sounded more mature than the younger characters, like Tomasu Haruka, who didn&#039;t have that youthful tone anymore to play Miyakoshi, Nakamura Yuichi who voices Higashi sounded as old as the character&#039;s daddy. Also Hikasa Yoko who voices Sayuri, her tone was simply very much of that of Rias Gremory.<br />
<br />
Character, I could say that they&#039;re the usual, but let&#039;s not forget that on a personality and role level the characters themselves were an alternate reversal of the the characters from the original, let&#039;s go over some of them: <br />
<br />
 Daisuke &quot; Higashi&quot; Higashida- Here, he replaces  Souta Takanashi, but unlike Takanashi, he is a tsundere here, who sometimes does some  tsun tsun on Miyakoshi.<br />
<br />
Miyakoshi Hana - Who replaces Inami Mahiru, is a complete polar opposite of the latter, who has a bad case of Androphobia and would not hesitate to do some violent tsun tsun on Takanashi. Here, she the aggressive dere dere to Higashi, she also happens to be the office (Wagnaria) bimbo, given that she doesn&#039;t do well with her studies.<br />
<br />
Kamakura, Shiho- Is Todoroki, Yachiyo&#039;s replacement, given that she is the scary one here who happens to have a murderous Yandere intent on Shindou, Yuuta. <br />
<br />
Shindou, Yuuta- can be consider as a replacement for Yamada Kirio, but only in a personality level, not on a role level, same thing with Nagata, Rui who can be considered as a replacement for Popura Taneshima, Yanagiba, Miri who can be considered as a Aoi Yamada replacement, but with some differences,  since Yamada is lazy, annoying and clumsy, now Yanagiba , can also be considered as lazy, and clumsy, but she also sickly who just like Aoi would prefer to loiter around than do any work or go to school.<br />
<br />
Now, Muranushi, Sayuri has something in common with Taknashi&#039;s sister, Takanashi, Izumi from the original Working, whom,  were both odd and mysterious in a personality level but not in a role level since Izumi was a writer while Sayuri is a college student and one of the part-timers at Wagnaria, also Izumi has a some level of brocon with her little brother Souta, Sayuri on the other hand is in a relationship with Adachi, Masahiro who replaces Sato Jun on a role level , but on a personalty level he is a complete opposite of Jun. same can also be said about Adachi&#039;s fellow chef, Kouno, Takuya who replaces  Souma, Hiroomi whose personality was cheesy unlike Kouno who is really a joker who can deliver.<br />
<br />
Saiki, Kouki, unlike the rest is Matsumoto, Maya&#039;s replacement only on the gender level, since both of their roles weren&#039;t that different at all.<br />
<br />
Kenichirou Sakaki whom also unlike the rest , replaces  Otoo, Hyougo, both their roles and personality were pretty much the same, the difference, are their age, one is younger while the other is older.<br />
<br />
Also, Kondou, Kisaki, in terms of personality, replaces Shirafuji, Kyouko, but on the role level , Kisaki is one of the part-timers while Kyouko is the manager. <br />
<br />
Now all that was said, I&#039;m giving this category a fair 6, since as alternate replacements, they can be consider as a band of their own, but only in a slight way.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment, I&#039;d say it&#039;s a good 7, thought , it&#039;s good, I&#039;m starting to already get tired of the same comedy and slice of life being use here.<br />
<br />
So overall, I&#039;m also giving it a good 7, since this spin-off does have some character development when it come to the romance. So I hope Studio A-1 Pictures doesn&#039;t come up with another season of this spin-off (if we can call it that way) cu&#039;z such sequel would violate the development that has already occurred with the characters. <br />
<br />
<br />
Happy New Year to all. <br />

    This review contain some info for old Working series. It&#039;s strongly advised to watch that beforehand.<br />
<br />
It cannot be helped that this will be compared to it&#039;s predecessor. I&#039;ve just marathoned the franchise the other time so I&#039;m still fresh about it. I think I&#039;ll list the strength and weakness over it&#039;s predecessor.<br />
<br />
One of my gripe about the latest installment is that the character are mutually exclusive to each other rather than the more dynamic old cast. In here they are to grouped with their respective partner and didn&#039;t interact much with other. Couple with their romantic interest and friend with each other. They are rarely

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236446">
        interact with one another unlike in old series which is more rounded like Yachiyo with Kyoko, Yachiyo with Satou, Satou with Popura, Satou with Souma, Souma with Aoi, Aoi with Souta, Souta with Popura, Souta with Inami. There are more than one relationship chart either friendship one or romantic ones.<br />
<br />
Other thing is that I feel several character are wasted here because they lack any partner. I think Kouno got it the hardest if I&#039;m reflecting on old series. Because the dynamic between Satou and Souma is so great I think just being a boke on a part of manzai duo is severely lacking as character. Because his only partner is Adachi when Adachi is not on the picture or is together with Muranishi he is being left out. Even if there is some build up at the beginning with Yanagiba that also is swept under the rug when Yanagiba is more often seen with Nagata. There is also Kisaki which I feel overshadowed by Daichi a character that are introduced at later point in the story.<br />
<br />
On the bright side this series still retain the spirit of the old series. The weird quirk of character and the dysfunctional workplace romance along with the gag is still can held it&#039;s own. Another thing is the progress of character relationship is fast here. Though at time it can also feel too fast it&#039;s still not on the point of being annoying.<br />
<br />
Overall even with it&#039;s downside compared to the original series WWW.Working!! can still held it&#039;s own as a series. While you can watch this without watching the original it&#039;s still advised that you are watching the original first so that you can capture the series charm properly.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m giving this 7.6 overall and rounding it to 8 on MAL scoring standard.

    The restaurant comedy series of Working ran three seasons strong with an hour long special to wrap up its story.  Combined with its still running 4-koma source material, it&#039;s safe to say that this series is still running quite strong despite its age.  So, what can you do when your series ends but the iron&#039;s still hot for more content?  Why, a spin-off of course.  <br />
<br />
Story: WWW.Working!! is the Working series with a new coat of paint.  Higashida Daisuke is forced to get a part-time job on account of his terrible family being terrible, and ends up getting a job

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236413">
        at Wagnaria, the family restaurant filled with a whole new plethora of misfits in what can only be described as a comedic phenomenon ripe for the picking.<br />
<br />
To put it bluntly, this spin-off is literally the Working series with new characters.  The series still relies heavily on character relationships and interactions combined with retorts, romantic subplots, and other situational comedy with character specific gags like that of its parent series.  In short, if you watched the Working series, expect to see the same kind of stuff here.  The only thing I found different between the two is the fact that this spin-off really likes the trope of hurting men.  Each of the three main relationships in this series focuses a lot on torturing the guy in each relationship in some way, shape, or form, which, while the original series did do some of, never utilized that trope to this extreme.  <br />
<br />
Another problem that this spin-off suffers from is pacing.  The original series had 3 cours to fully tell their stories while this one only had 1 cour to do roughly the same amount of storytelling, so a lot of the loose end tying that happens in the end of the series feels rushed and a bit sloppy.  <br />
<br />
But really, that&#039;s all I can really say about the story.  In essence, it&#039;s the same show.  It&#039;s even the same restaurant, so I suppose there&#039;s not really much you can do with that setting if you&#039;re trying to do a spin-off.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+/-  Literally the exact same kind of plot.  Just with different characters.<br />
<br />
Characters:  Similar to its parent, WWW.Working!! hosts a band of strange misfit characters with a greater majority of them falling into romantic relationships that end up as dysfunctional as you would probably expect them to be.  <br />
<br />
First we have the duo of Higashida and Miyakoshi, the highschooler who has to make his own pay due to his family&#039;s incompetence, and the idiot who can turn chocolate into a lethal weapon.  Despite being the &#039;main couple&#039; of the series, these two characters are arguably what I consider to be most lackluster of the bunch.  Their characters feel forced together, and even with all of the visits to St. Valentine and indifference these two go through, nothing really clicks together in the end.  Maybe that&#039;s due to the fact that the spin-off was rushed so much towards the end, but personally, I don&#039;t really find much solid ground to base their relationship around, even though it was entertaining.<br />
<br />
Then we have the next duo of Adachi and Muranashi, the poor soul and the kuudere with a mean streak who refuses to believe that she can see the occult.  Similarly to the first couple, these two don&#039;t really make all that much sense, but they have more of a base than the other one.  Mostly revolving around Adachi being a wimp and unsure of what his future may hold, as well as Muranashi&#039;s somewhat sociopathic tendencies when it comes to her significant other, the comedic routine with these two revolves mostly around Adachi trying to run away from something while Muranashi grabs onto him and tries to get him to man up.  You know, normal couple stuff.<br />
<br />
And finally, we have arguably the most complete couple of the bunch, Shindou and Shiho, the loser who has to pay his father&#039;s debt, and the rich girl whose daddy is the creditor of that debt.  Thankfully, this one is simpler and a lot less difficult to explain.  Sadistic girl who tortures the guy she likes while the guy grovels to try and pay off what he (sadly) owes before the climax of the series happens with sweet, sweet role reversal as the crux.  Admittedly, I found this couple to be the most entertaining and fulfilling of romantic relationships, especially when compared to the other two.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast falls into the realm of quirky nobodies that honestly don&#039;t have much of a role in the series, and are only really there to add in a touch of weirdness to this already strange family restaurant.  There&#039;s Kouno, the idiot, Saiki, the foreigner who struggles to speak Japanese, Kisaki, a smoker who brings her baby to work, and the dyslexic manager.  (There&#039;re more, but this section has gone on long enough.)  They add comedy to the series, but not really much in the way of plot progression.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ One good romantic storypoint<br />
+/- Comedic sidecharacters (who don&#039;t participate in much)<br />
-  Most of the romantic stories felt rushed or unnatural<br />
<br />
Art: Produced by A-1, like the rest of the Working series, the art comes as no surprise as the bright, clean, simple artstyle that the Working series has.  It&#039;s on-par with the company&#039;s production quality, so there&#039;s not really much to say.  Comedic faces, usage of chibis in certain situations, and doom and gloom backdrops when something comedically drastic is happening, all the same stuff.<br />
<br />
Sound:  The sound really isn&#039;t all that exciting if I may be honest.  It&#039;s bright, it&#039;s cheery, it&#039;s kinda memorable, but I wouldn&#039;t really much thought into it.  <br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment:  Working is one of those series that I would say is a reliable source of entertainment for me.  With character interactions and romantic relationships as the brunt source of content, I never really get tired of this show even though it&#039;s more or less the exact same thing.  Which is why watching this, I knew exactly what I was getting into.  And surprise surprise, I got exactly what I thought I was going to get.  Which is actually pretty good, if I may be honest.<br />
<br />
Did I like this series?<br />
<br />
I mean, it&#039;s Working.  I like Working.  Yes, I liked it.  But really, if I were to really point out something, it would be the relationship between Shindou and Shiho.  Especially during the climax point.  Like hands down, that is probably my favorite part in this entire series.  <br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I like about this series?<br />
<br />
I wasn&#039;t a fan of the rushing.  Though to be fair, I don&#039;t think that was avoidable due to the fact that they had to make 3 separate storylines come together in 12 episodes, so I suppose they did the best they could.  <br />
<br />
Would I recommend this series?<br />
<br />
If you watched and liked Working, watch this.  It&#039;s literally the exact same series with new faces, and I guarantee, you will not be disappointed.

    I was so excited when I heard the news that they would be making another anime that was similar to Working! and I must say it&#039;s just as enjoyable to watch. It is almost quite literally the exact same show, they&#039;re in the same location (A different Wagnaria) but with new quirky and funny characters. It&#039;s like I&#039;m re-watching one of my favorite shows all over, and I love it.<br />
<br />
Early on you can see the potential love interests, a bunch of character specific interactions and many other funny side events taking place that will be running gags throughout the show. The art and music is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review237007">
        on par with its spin-off counterpart, with it&#039;s catchy OP and ED. <br />
<br />
But with that said the show doesn&#039;t come without it&#039;s flaws (which actually get a fair bit better as the show goes on, but I&#039;ll get into that later), the biggest one being they seem to be relying on some of the gags too much. Stuff like during one of the episodes they have a big time skip (1 year) so they could re-use Hana&#039;s deadly chocolate gag on valentines day, I mean.. what&#039;s the point of that? The show seems to be very hit or miss and its gags are kinda split up being on opposite sides of the spectrum, on one side you have a few awesome characters, the hilarious gags that come with them and some great development between them but on the other side you have kind of dull characters and just annoying gags that the show seems to be repeating, like the one I stated earlier. Now as I previously said, as the show progressed some of these flaws start to fade away, they stop re-using the same boring jokes and some of the lesser like-able characters actually ended up being quite the opposite by the end, after you learn more about them they start changing the way they think and act and are overall just much better then what they started off as.<br />
<br />
The show also had it&#039;s character/story progression a lot faster then the original did with 3 couples dating by the end of the show. Early on I was skeptical on whether or not the show was going to have a nice ending similar to the original Working! with the show pretty much guaranteed to be one season only, but thankfully it actually has a really sweet ending making the viewer feel very fulfilled. Now while we don&#039;t get to see every little side story get resolved like the original, all the important ones get tied off nicely as we see most of the characters grow up and move on with their lives.<br />
<br />
Overall with the show having it&#039;s ups and downs (most of which are in the first half of the show) I still don&#039;t think it&#039;s quite as good as its predecessor but it&#039;s certainly still worth checking out.

    Web Working (WWW.Working) is NOT a SEQUEL from previous Working! series. <br />
You put that in mind, watch this Great anime with clear mind to get the best experience.<br />
<br />
And this review maybe a little weird for someone that haven&#039;t watch the original series.<br />
<br />
Story (9/10)<br />
The story is smiliar to previous Working its a romcom, but with less filler (thats one aspect that I like from this show). Its a nice romcom, nice development, didn&#039;t found anything that feel forced or annoying. The jokes is not dry, it can make you grin or giggle for a little but absolutely not like when you watch pure comedy anime like

        Gintama. Its kinda laid back. Its nice short story about member of Wagnaria.<br />
<br />
Art (9/10)<br />
I want to give 8 point, but nice animation at three last episode makes it deserve more. They did a good job at animation. <br />
<br />
The character design is likeable, not over-moefication that become annoying. Its nice simple anime design.<br />
<br />
Sound (8/10)<br />
Nice OP, Nice ED, Nice BGM. Nothing to say here. Still skip-able OP/ED so I give it 8.<br />
<br />
Character (8/10)<br />
The character is nice too, but somehow at half end of the show some character seems weaker. idk exactly, but its a little annoying.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (9/10)<br />
Its a nice short romance comedy anime with many development between the character. The joke on point. And the episode is short.<br />
<br />
Overall (9/10)<br />
Again I said it. Nice short romance comedy. Less Filler, Nice Art, Enjoyable. Nothing epic happen thou (can&#039;t give 10 point because of that).

    I was excited when I heard that Working!! is getting a new anime series. Working!! ended on a beautiful and conclusive note but it wasn&#039;t enough for me. I wanted more so I prayed for more and I guess the Gods of Anime must have heard my prayers by giving us this &quot;spin-off&quot;. You know what I have to say about this new series? It lived up to my expectations. <br />
<br />
<br />
[Story]<br />
WWW.Working!! is technically the first in the franchise. This was adapted from a web manga called &quot;Working!! Web-ban&quot; which came first before the beloved &quot;Working&quot; which we all know and love. Basically, it was like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236399">
        the author&#039;s first draft before she (or he?) got serious and started writing Working!!. For the sake of this review (and the sake of simplicity) though, I&#039;m going to call this series a &quot;spin-off&quot; and the previous Working!! as the original even though it&#039;s the other way around. Why am I providing you this info? Because I&#039;m a nice guy and to also inform you why this series is the way it is (i.e, this spin-off is more crazier than the original, rushed romance and etc.). <br />
<br />
WWW.Working takes place in the same old &quot;Wagnaria&quot; restaurant but the characters are entirely different. The MC is now about a serious first year student (who is also not a lolic- I mean, loli-loving) Daisuke who decided to get a part-time job after his father&#039;s company goes bankrupt. <br />
<br />
Some fans of the original Working series might crucify me for saying this but WWW.Working&#039;s comedic aspect is a lot better than the first two seasons of Working. However, the 3rd Season&#039;s comedy is on par with this spin-off. The gags didn&#039;t consistently made me laugh per say but it definitely made me laugh more than the first two seasons of the original Working!!<br />
Why is that? It&#039;s because the character dynamics in this show is perfect<br />
When both of the characters&#039; personalities clash together in this show, it leads to a whole wide array of funny moments. To top it off, the character&#039;s quirks are more crazier here than the original Working. It&#039;s like their quirkiness level is turned up to 11 out of 10. <br />
<br />
The gags did get a little bit repetitive like the whole chocolate joke thing (They even skipped a whole year just to repeat the gag) but for the most part, they were creative enough to make the jokes interesting and funny almost every time. <br />
<br />
One last aspect that I want to talk about is the romance. The original Working&#039;s romance was simply heartwarming and beautiful. It moved at a slow pace and nothing felt wrong when they got together because they spent enough time to justify them being a couple. In this series, that wasn&#039;t the case. The romantic progression was very rushed. You&#039;d think they&#039;d produce another season for this series just like they did with the original to spend time on the relationship development but nope..All of the characters got together with someone in this season. <br />
<br />
While I thought the romance aspect of WWW.Working was ehh, this wasn&#039;t really a big issue for me. Since this was like a first draft for the author, you can tell that she didn&#039;t take this work seriously. All of the romance in this series was played in a comedic kind of way. Hence, the reason why this show isn&#039;t really tagged as &quot;Romance&quot;. So if you&#039;re expecting a more serious romance like the 3rd Season of Working brought to us then you&#039;re not going to get it.   <br />
______________________________________________________________<br />
[Art/Animation]: (7/10)<br />
The art and visuals looks slightly worse than the 3rd Season of Working!! and that season was released at least a year ago so I don&#039;t know what the hell happened here. Reduced budget? Different staff? It doesn&#039;t really matter that much because it wasn&#039;t that painful to watch and it took a very short time to get used to WWW.Working&#039;s art style and its visuals. <br />
______________________________________________________________<br />
[Sound]: (8.5/10)<br />
Just like the previous Working, the soundtracks are ok. Nothing really stood out, it was just ok. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)<br />
<br />
The OP theme song is &quot;Eyecatch! Too much!&quot; by Haruka Tomatsu, Yoko Hikasa, and Sora Amamiya. Ahh, Working..Back at it again with the over-the-top, hilarious and somehow very catchy OPs. I pretty much love this OP just as much as the previous OPs. It sounds very catchy because of its very fast melody. <br />
The ED theme song is &quot;Muchuuryoku Fever&quot; by Yuuichi Nakamura, Kouki Uchyama, and Kensho Ono. Hmm, I see that A-1 Pictures is still following the trend where the male characters sings the ED and the female characters sings the OP. Well, I love that trend so I&#039;m glad it&#039;s still the same thing for this show. The ED sounds really good and I&#039;m glad the voices are light and aren&#039;t so over the top like those rock songs. It perfectly fits my taste. <br />
______________________________________________________________<br />
[Characters]: (8/10)<br />
It&#039;s quite disappointing that none of the characters here came close to living up to the greatness of the characters from the original Working!!, like Yamada (best girl) or Popura but the characters here in WWW.Working are still a bunch of good characters nonetheless. One of the main reasons why I liked the characters here are their personalities. I love their personalities and they were extremely hilarious. That&#039;s the reason why I thought this show was more hilarious than the first two seasons of the original Working!!<br />
<br />
The character dynamics is what this show nailed though...perfectly. For example, one of the character dynamics that I really enjoyed watching was between Shiho and Yuuta. They both have quite a bit of history together and that&#039;s the reason why our &quot;tsundere/sadist&quot; here tortures (not physically) our poor Yuuta. Their dynamics just kills me. I ended up laughing whenever I see Shiho torture Yuuta in so many ways possible and the more hilarious part is she enjoys it, hence the reason why she&#039;s a sadist. Also, Shiho just became my best girl of WWW.Working because I like girls that are a mix of tsundere and sadism. <br />
<br />
Of course, I also love the other character dynamics like the interaction between Higashida and Miyakoshi or between Muranashi and Adachi and many more but Shiho and Yuta&#039;s dynamic is the one that I enjoyed the most. <br />
______________________________________________________________<br />
[Enjoyment]: (8.5/10)<br />
Aaaand here goes another seasonal anime that I&#039;m going to miss and another symptom of &quot;Anime Withdrawal Symptoms&quot; that I need to deal with. I&#039;m really going to miss this anime because this was one of my weekly dosage of comedy and I really enjoyed this show so much. At least, there&#039;s KonoSuba S2 next season so I don&#039;t have to worry about my weekly dosage of comedy running out ;). <br />
______________________________________________________________<br />
[VERDICT]<br />
Working!! is much better than this series but that doesn&#039;t mean I hate this series. In fact, I love this series just as much as I loved the original Working!! While the romance aspect of the show was ehh compared to the original series, the great comedy makes up for it. WWW.Working!! made me laugh just as much as the 3rd season of Working!! did and it was definitely better than the first 2 seasons in terms of the comedic aspect. The reason for that are the characters and their dynamics. If you&#039;re a fan of Working!! or shows that has great comedy then this is definitely recommended. Just don&#039;t expect it to live up to the greatness of Working!!<br />
<br />
<br />
[OVERALL]: (8.4/10)<br />
<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
+Even though I&#039;m a big fan of Working!!, I still enjoyed watching this series<br />
+Great Comedy<br />
+Catchy OP and ED theme songs, as always<br />
+Fun cast of characters with enjoyable and hilarious personalities<br />
+Great Character Dynamics<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
-Romance is the weakest aspect of this show<br />
-Gags can get a bit repetitive <br />
-Art and Visuals looks cheap compared to the 3rd Season of Working!!

    At first, I was a bit hesitant. <br />
I was a bit sad when I saw none of the original characters, who I&#039;m really fond of, would make an appearance in the series, but after my Working rewatch, I felt like I should give it a chance.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m really happy I gave it a chance, I liked it quite much. It took me a few episodes to get used to the new characters, but once I got into it, I watched the complete series.<br />
<br />
It felt new, but also very familiar. I liked seeing this welcoming restaurant with its odd characters again.<br />
<br />
I liked the fact that it’s, just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304545">
        like the original, very cute and heartwarming. It really helps taking your mind of the daily dose of stress. It has a lovely soundtrack and the ending is better than any of the endings from the original series.<br />
<br />
I recommend the series to those who have seen the original Working series but still want more. If you’re interested in WWW.Working, but you haven’t seen the original series yet, I recommend you watch those first.<br />

    Being a fan of the franchise I really wanted to like this season. But I do know that I have to set my expectations lower since it&#039;s a whole different cast (cat group) and the web-ban is not as popular as the manga version (dog group). But boy I was still disappointed.<br />
<br />
Working&#039;s comedy always have its ups and downs. The worst being the insane leaps of logic and flat humor the writer tries to force onto the show. And apparently that&#039;s all that this anime is about. The circumstances and situations are characters are in are so incredibly forced and unbelievable, it&#039;s painful to carry

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243387">
        on.<br />
<br />
The characters are also incredibly one-dimensional. Every character can simple be summed by one or two traits, and sometimes that trait exists solely for a gag for another character. Let me give it a shot:<br />
<br />
Miyakoshi<br />
- Energetic. Absolute idiot.<br />
Higashida<br />
- Exists for Tsukkomi, mostly for Miyakoshi&#039;s idiocy.<br />
Muranushi<br />
- Can see ghosts. Scary smile. (Why? Because story says so, that&#039;s why)<br />
Adachi<br />
- Solely exist to be scared of Muranushi&#039;s smile.<br />
Shindou<br />
- Bullied by Kamakura because he&#039;s poor.<br />
Kamakura<br />
- Bully Shindou because she&#039;s rich.<br />
Kondou<br />
- Teenage single mom. Doesn&#039;t work.<br />
Kouno<br />
- Who?<br />
Saiki<br />
- Speaks english (Yes that&#039;s his entire character)<br />
Sakaki<br />
- Useless pushover manager<br />
Nagata<br />
- Being mortified by everything<br />
Yanagiba<br />
- Being weird<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not saying that the original cast (dog group) doesn&#039;t suffer from one-dimension characters and jokes, but WWW.Working is all about it. I can&#039;t even finish this.

    A brilliant addition to the Working!! Franchise.<br />
<br />
I was sceptical at first as it contains a whole new cast compared to the original series however, this was quickly overturned the moment i got through the first episode.<br />
<br />
Despite a new cast and new location, it has the warmth and same feeling as the original series. The new characters are each unique and likeable, throughout the series you also see how each of them interact with one another and the changes in their personalities.<br />
<br />
This anime is a great relaxation anime with romance and comedy, perfect to relax and binge on a few episodes or watching the entire season

    I heard a lot of praise about WWW.Working and how it was as fun as the original Working!! series even though it only had one season. I felt like those people were just fans and were over-exaggerating but Goddamn. They were right. By a small margin though. In case you don&#039;t know, I still love the Working!! series a lot.<br />
<br />
It&#039;ll be very difficult to review the show without comparing it to the original series and so if you haven&#039;t watched the original series, worry not, even though I will be comparing the two, you don&#039;t have to watch the original series to understand this, unless

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274516">
        if you missed that reference in the beginning of the first episode ;)<br />
<br />
A slice of life which gave us quite a bit of plot thrown in towards the end, WWW.Working had a few interesting bits such as St. Valentine, a hilarious gag which went on till the end of the show. It although didn&#039;t move too forward in it&#039;s plot, it was a brilliant job in terms of making a base for a slice of life anime to continue. Read on to find out what makes this series better than the other! And why this show is definitely worth a try!!!<br />
<br />
WWW.Working kicks off into action immediately. Giving me my favorite MC in a career role and a much better support cast, no, the supporting cast was much better than the other series and apart from that it was one of the best casts I&#039;ve seen in a long time. The way development was given to every single character in just 13 episodes shocked me because not even Working!! could manage that in 2 seasons (I have yet to watch S3 since I got tired of it). What sets itself apart from the original is a pretty long list. This new series is better in almost every way. Higashida like I mentioned before isn&#039;t a dense idiot as most of the anime MCs in high school anime tend to be, this guy was dead inside, in a hilarious way, and he wasn&#039;t dense at all, a huge refresher. If that wasn&#039;t enough to entice you into watching this beauty, take a much more entertaining substitute for Poplar in the form of Hana. She was an idiotic airhead I know, but the way the show handled her idiocy was hilarious. I&#039;m hugely impressed by the way they portrayed her and Higashida&#039;s interactions and to be honest it felt much better than the unfortunately poor pair of the original Working!! couple. <br />
<br />
Another thing I found better was the soundtrack, now Working also did a very good job of pulling you in with the soundtrack but I felt the little jingles and fun OST made me laugh at not only the comic situations but the added music as well. The characters as well were amazing. In particular the supporting cast. Or actually everyone for that matter. I really enjoyed the way Muranushi and Adachi&#039;s relationship was portrayed and to be honest they were just favorite pair in the show. The embarrassing and sometimes cute situations were so funny I couldn&#039;t stop laughing at them. That&#039;s to say nothing of the other characters, Shiho and Yuuta had their funny moments although I found them really enjoyable only in the last few episodes since that&#039;s when the show actually progressed forward for them, a huge shout-out to my man Saiki as well for his amazing attempt at learning and mastering (?) Japanese all thanks to the also amazing Kisaki-san. They both were really hilarious both together and independently as well, while Yanagiba and Nagata were also cute. I commend the author for making so many characters fit in so perfectly and I felt deeply attached to each and every one of these characters.<br />
<br />
As for the Staff, I can&#039;t say I wasn&#039;t impressed by the way they performed their roles. I am already very much familiar with Haruka Tomatsu so it wasn&#039;t much of a surprise seeing her nail the role. As for the other staff, Yuuichi Nakamura played Higashida and seeing how he did amazing roles such as Tomoya from Clannad I think you all can judge how he would do here. The other cast was amazing as well and I&#039;d give a special shout-out to Yoko Hikasa (Sayuri Muranushi) and Momo Asakura (Yanagiba) since they both were soooo cute to watch!!!<br />
<br />
Animated by A-1 Pictures, it wasn&#039;t much of a surprise to see such a cutely and nicely made anime. The character designs they did were also adorable and they captured the attractive and slightly moe aspect of WWW.Working excellently. It wasn&#039;t just fun but it felt like eye candy. Props for the vibrant OP and ED as well, just like Working!!, It was a joy to watch.<br />
<br />
Do I like WWW.Working? Or more accurately do I prefer it to the original series? Yes to both. I was quite skeptical of the show since I thought it wouldn&#039;t best Working!! which I still love but I was quite surprised to know and realise that WWW. didn&#039;t just equal the original which had 3 seasons, but it surpassed it in just a measly 13 episodes. I found myself really attached to the characters and the show itself. Everyone&#039;s interactions were so heartwarming and left a lasting impression on myself. I started with a smile, and ended with a smile. Not a single second went by with me criticising the show, much the opposite, not a second went by with me praising and laughing at the antics of everyone. Really, if a season 2 comes out I doubt it&#039;ll fail to disappoint. Now that came at a cost, since WWW.Working had an ending which gave quite a bit of closure unlike Working!! which gave openings for sequels to continue so I doubt we&#039;ll see a season 2 but nonetheless, the show&#039;s definitely worth a try. I mean, A-1 Pictures did an excellent job animating it and I&#039;m a huge fan of their animations and adaptations as well for that matter. So, why not try it? I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll &quot;catch your eye&quot; as the opening says ;)

    So, here&#039;s something embarrassing...<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve never actually watched the original Working!! anime. After I heard the remix with the Working!! them and the beastie boys, I had to just check it out. After typing into Google; &quot;Working!! episode 1&quot;, I was instead greeted to WWW.Working. (Yes I pirate my anime, keep outta my business will ya?) Me being an arrogant little prick, I (Instead of looking up why there&#039;s three W&#039;s in the name and why the name is different than the one on MyAnimeList, my beautiful mind decided to watch this one first. Now, as I said, I don&#039;t know how good the original Working!!

          <span style="display: none;" id="review273835">
        anime is, but I gotta say, I had a blast watching this one!<br />
<br />
First of all, it&#039;s beautiful, it&#039;s my favourite style of anime. I&#039;ve always loved A-1 for their animes, and this one&#039;s no exception! It&#039;s a mix of new and old nostalgic anime, at least how I see it. The characters are all interesting and have their own unique charm. They&#039;re all weird in their own special way, and it&#039;s hilarious. The OP isn&#039;t the same as the Working!! OP, but I&#039;ve never seen the original so I don&#039;t have much to compare to, regardless, it wasn&#039;t a shit OP, it wasn&#039;t amazing like Love Hina or Hagani, it was meh. The plot is nothing much either, it&#039;s more of The Simpsons-esque type of plot, where there&#039;s a template, and random episodes leading up. It&#039;s still awesome though, it&#039;s interesting and fun to watch. I&#039;ve never run through a series so fast in my life. I watched them all in two sittings. For the enjoyment, it&#039;s a solid 10 from me. I never once got bored of watching and never decided to turn in off, I only split my view time in half as it was late and I had school the next day. <br />
<br />
Other than all that, I loved it, it&#039;s funny, interesting and has romance to make you feel not so lonely in life for a bit. And even with the ending being not much, I felt emotions, for once...<br />
<br />
I 100% recommend this anime, it get&#039;s Brax&#039;s seal of approval (The guy in my profile pic, or maybe he&#039;s not in my pic and I&#039;ve changed it. In that case it gets the approval of whoever is in it now...)<br />
<br />
That&#039;s pretty much it, yeet.

    This is my first time watching the Working!!! series and I have to say this anime did not let me down. I think I&#039;ve tried watching the real Working!! but I think i dropped it because I was busy and completely forgot about the anime which is why I felt like i&#039;ve seen an anime with a familiar name.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
------<br />
The story is mainly just slice of life but it has comedy so you just know that the main characters or stars will have unrealistic personalities. But what I did not expect in this anime was the romance. I feel like romance is a big genre in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296305">
        this anime since I think all of them are related to romance but its the kind of romance where it isn&#039;t really serious stuff so there isn&#039;t any drama in it. The story is great you know, a high schooler that works at a part time job and bla-bla-bla. Real cliche. But it&#039;s comedy so what can I say right? Since the main genres are Slice of Life and Comedy, than I would say that the slice of life was just fine. And so was the comedy. I enjoyed my time watching this anime and I don&#039;t really feel like it needs more work or could have been better. I mean it could have been much better but hey, in the end it made me laugh and that it what matters to me. There is romance which makes it a whole lot better in my opinion.<br />
9/10<br />
Art<br />
------<br />
So it&#039;s your generic 2015+ anime art and I can&#039;t really comment much about it. Easily said, the art style is good enough. The characters don&#039;t have hairstyles that are too weird but still, good enough. I mean, orange hair. That isn&#039;t really realistic but who cares right? It&#039;s a damn anime.<br />
So in conclusion the art doesn&#039;t bother me too much and I can&#039;t really compliment much about it.<br />
7/10<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
------<br />
Okay, so the opening has a fine song, though it is not the kind of song that I would download and listen to a lot because it is kind of annoying honetsly but the song isn&#039;t like the kind I would hate a lot. But the MV is nice. It&#039;s ute I guess? The ED is technically just the same imo. But the last episode ED was much better though. I mean it is the same song but it went more smoothly lmao. Voice acting is nice though there isn&#039;t much that stands out. But still fun to listen to. The english made me cringe a little lol.<br />
7/10<br />
<br />
Character<br />
------<br />
The characters are just great in my opinion. Higashida has the personality that I love the most for a Male MC. The kind of type that doesn&#039;t have emotion and isn&#039;t that much of a damn wimp. (or just mature). Hana is just terrible at cooking but how her affection changes towards Higashida in the end is really cute and enjoyable. Sayuri has that deadly smile because it is just too unexpected and cute from a girl who barely shows emotion. Shiho is just a sadist and Yuuta is the victim. Though they got out of it in the end. Not really into Adachi&#039;s personality but its fine. Hime is the most cute though. <br />
9/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment / Overall<br />
------<br />
Pretty sad to see these characters on their last episode. I mean I feel that way on every anime. We won&#039;t be able to see them again so i&#039;d have to find anoter anime. BUt personally I enjoyed this naime a lot becuase I had nothing else to do. with a good story and good characters ( I mean they aren&#039;t bad enough so) I can&#039;t really give myself a reason to not like this anime. I really love the thank you at the end of the anime. It is so fun to see the producers thanking their audience (even though I&#039;m watching on a pirated site lol). It&#039;s nice to see an ending that I could be happy with and an ending that shows it is the end of the anime. No damn cliffhangers.<br />
I rate anime based on how much I enjoy them and how much it made me feel so if I felt like something could&#039;ve been better i&#039;d put it a little down but this did not let me down and I think it&#039;s a good anime.<br />
<br />
8/10<br />

    Was excited  or worried when I found out about this anime, after watching all of Working years ago.<br />
<br />
To put it short and frankly, I quit during mid of 2nd episode as this was just terrible. Characters are annoying, sound is agitating/irritating and since the series was never really about a plot but more about comedy/slice of life, it frustrated me too that this anime has no funny parts at all. They didn&#039;t even get a smirk or chuckle out of me.<br />
<br />
One of the worst anime I gave try. Wouldn&#039;t have watched it past 3 minutes of 1st episode if I hadn&#039;t watched and totally

    FULL FINAL REVIEW:<br />
<br />
TL;DR – A series with different character in the same setting, a spin off actually.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the previous series of working which ended perfectly with 3 seasons and a special episode. A-1 decides to adapt its spin off series which is WWW.Working!! I’m glad to see they retain some of the staff of the original working series and the studio in charge. There’s a lot of similarities between the origin and the spin off series, with the exception of the restaurants of course, nevertheless character wise and chemistry among them are almost similar to that original series.<br />
<br />
I have a good feeling that this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236415">
        series would be on par with the original series, but only for the first few episodes. It started off really well, with the introduction of most of the characters from main to supporting, and they all really have funny characteristics, I mean the gag to make people laugh out loud while watching. However starting with the episode that has love contents on all that, I don’t like how the characters were being dense and confused on what the others were talking about.  Not saying I hate romance, I love romcom in fact. I just hate how characters become so confused only to realize it later. Well, this is just my opinion. Everyone has its own subjective opinion’s. Nevertheless, I still enjoy the spin off providing the love confusion but managed to resolve it at the end. <br />
<br />
Arts and animations, are on par with the original series, so I have no comment on that. Albeit, with slight alternations in eye designs.<br />
<br />
What interest me is the selection of the seiyuus for each of the characters. There’s nothing wrong with the seiyuus but I like how the seiyuu’s voice fits to the character behavior in that series, for example Higashida who is voiced by Nakamura Yuuichi who also voice acted on Oreki Houtarou, both of which characters have dull and self-focus minded expressions. Pretty much all the VA’S were performing well, at least there aint any hiccups around. Sound tracks like the Opening and Ending songs are catchy to listen, and the OST aren’t bad either.<br />
<br />
With that, it leaves me with the scoring of the series, I wanted to give a 6 due to its lack of vibe and its characters being so confused especially when it comes to relationships. However I decided to give a score of 7 being with the series has a similar plot to the original series and it’s animation works and of course the seiyuus. That pretty much didn’t bore me to death when watching it, glad I didn’t drop this series. So with that my final score is 7 for the series. Not too shabby, not too bad, just an enjoyable series to laugh off and releasing stress.<br />
<br />
I would recommend you guys to watch this, if you already completed the original series, however if you really miss the original series, I suggest re-watch the original series. Those who wants to look for a funny series after watching a sad anime series, this is a right recipe for you to watch to whack out those Post-Anime depressions, providing that you can withstand the problems especially when the characters are dealing with relationships.<br />

&quot;Thank you! We look forward to your next visit.&quot;<br />

Story: 6<br />
<br />
WWW.Working !! has a rapid narrative and temporal progression. Each episode takes place one or two months apart from each other, which prevents a deeper development and specification of the characters, but results in a sense of agility, differentiating it from other Slice of life animes.<br />
<br />
The story is developed around two simple situations, which causes a repetition of jokes and wears out comedy, making it tiring in some parts. Since there is not much time to work each relationship in depth, the plot sometimes forces some situations to move the narrative and the development of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review268142">
        characters. However, even if it becomes tiring after a few episodes, the development of the relationship between the three couples occurs in a very satisfactory way.<br />
<br />
A bad point is that several dramas and previously created situations were completely ignored during the course of the anime. Most of them have been completely neglected to make way for a fast and sometimes effective development of the relationship between the characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 5<br />
<br />
The art of WWW.Working, very similar to the original series, does not have many unique elements and relation to the story, as it happens in other animes. The animation is relatively average, with no flowing moments or very well animated, but maintaining a consistency.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6<br />
<br />
The soundtrack and the dubbing of the anime do not stand out, but they are not bad. The opening is very good, it manages to convey well the atmosphere of the anime and joins a pleasant song with elements of the story.<br />
<br />
Characters:7<br />
<br />
The characters are what makes the anime quite enjoyable to watch, the dynamic between them is very interesting and it is often what makes situations and misunderstandings funny. However the development of the personality of the characters is small, mainly because they have little screen time.<br />
<br />
None of them stand out individually or have a great background story, but all contribute in one way or another to create the pleasant climate of Wagnaria.<br />
<br />
If I were to highlight a couple, it would be Shiho and Shindou. Their story, even though it was a little exaggerated, was the one that surprised me the most and had a deeper understanding than the others.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:7<br />
<br />
This was an anime in which I had a great time, not only because of the comedy itself, but also because of the relationship between the restaurant staff. However, it is necessary to emphasize that there are some holes in the script and leave many loose ends in the anime, even with it having a closed end. This has somewhat diminished the quality of my anime experience.<br />
<br />
Overall:7<br />
<br />
WWW.Working was, overall, a good anime. It has its entertainment mainly based on the relationship between the characters and not necessarily on their development. Initially, it seemed to be more focused on comedy, but went on to highlight the romance in its second half. For those looking for a nice Slice of Life anime and romance, this is going to be a good choice.

    WWW.Working!!, new characters, new antics, same old WAGNARIA.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s get right to it with it&#039;s characters.<br />
<br />
The characters really felt like the original series character just with differing quirks and because of the very near similarities..BULLETPOINTS TIME!!!!!<br />
<br />
*Daisuke Higashida &amp; Hana Miyakoshi (Yuuichi Makamura &amp; Haruka Tomatsu) - Are effectively the same as the main characters from the original Working! of Souta Takanashi and Mahiru Inami, just replace being afraid of men and lots of punching and trying to cure that with trying to make GOOD chocolate, the &quot;pain&quot; with how horrible Hana&#039;s cooking is and trying to cure that.<br />
*Shiho Kamakura &amp; Yuuta Shindou (Sora Amamiya &amp; Kensho

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236390">
        Ono) - Shiho is essentially Hiroomi Souma from the original just change &quot;blackmailing his co-workers&quot; with &quot;money bribing&quot; mainly towards Yuuta as Yuuta is his childhood friend and he owes debt to her thus causing the rift between them, but Shiho&#039;s antics is more brutal compared to Hiroomi&#039;s antics.<br />
*Sayuri Muranushi &amp; Masahiro Adachi (Yoko Hisaka &amp; Kouki Uchiyama) - Feels like Jun Satou and Yachiyo Todoroki especially in the &quot;will they, won&#039;t they&quot;, just replace Jun&#039;s utter shyness to Yachiyo to Masahiro being utterly terrified by Sayuri&#039;s change in personality from her ghostly default and as a parallel, Sayuri carries knives similar to Yachiyo&#039;s katana wearing.<br />
*Kisaki Kondou &amp; Kenichirou Sakaki (Nana Mizuki &amp; Kousuke Toriumi) - Is Kyouko Shirafuji and Hyougo Otoo, as Kisaki and Kyouko both effectively don&#039;t do any work (Kisaki through MANY excuses, Kyouko because she&#039;s the manager), they are also the deadpan honest as hell character telling the obvious to the rest of the cast, Hyougo and Kenichirou are the effectively the heads of their respective restaurants who can&#039;t control the rest of the core cast members and have no power even though they have the highest rank.<br />
*Takuya Kouno (Hiro Shimono) - Feels like a mesh of both Hiroomi Souma in vocal personality but have the appearance similar to Jun Satou, it gets even similar as he&#039;s a chef just like the original characters, he&#039;s &quot;inspired by&quot;, but his true comedic value comes from his misunderstandings of the various things that occur in WAGNARIA, making him a rather deadringer for Popura Taneshima in the original in terms of comedic advice.<br />
*Miri Yanagiba (Momo Asakura) - Is Aoi Yamada but slightly less like her, they are both truants in most cases and likes to jab at thier main male characters<br />
*Rui Nagata (Ari Ozawa) - Feels like she&#039;s the closest character that comes close to Popura Taneshima, they are both love interests to the main male characters and occasionally misunderstands things especially concerning their love interests.<br />
<br />
The two new characters that seem entirely new are Kouki Saiki voiced by Yoshimasa Hosoya, a 20 year old college student who was born and raised in a different country, thus he can&#039;t speak Japanese. If LA had to say, he&#039;s a bit like Kirio Yamada from the original, just merely for the fact that some of their actions causes some unpredictability with their random quirks.<br />
<br />
Now since we&#039;re done with similarities...LA&#039;s favourite character?...Sayuri...just Sayuri, she has the best comedic skits (along with her comedic timing with her &quot;change of appearance&quot; running gag that almost never got old) and her mysteriousness along with her voice actor Yoko Hisaka just made her LA&#039;s favourite character from EPISODE ONE.<br />
<br />
For the most part, there are three main comedy skits within WWW.Working!!, Miyakoshi and Higashida&#039;s chocolate transporting into &quot;Valentine World&quot; (effectively nearly dying and getting advice from St. Valentine chibi), Sayuri and Adachi&#039;s romantic relationship with Sayuri surprising smiles and Adachi general obliviousness and finally Yuuta and Shiho&#039;s debt owing and bribing. For LA and that comedy is being subjective and all, LA thought that Sayuri and Adachi&#039;s comedy was pretty diverse by using the their relationship and their actions as driving points to both both their relationship and bring out their comedy at the same time. LA thought that Yuuta and Shiho got stale by the halfway point and what with Shiho&#039;s sadism towards Yuuta was slightly too harsh for the sake of &quot;comedy&quot; but thankfully it got better later on. Finally we have Miyakoshi and Higashida&#039;s comedy in which LA thought it was the average one out of the three, it wasn&#039;t too bad but it fell into being stale as to how repetitive they took it, Miyakoshi&#039;s obliviousness and personality and Higashida&#039;s non-changing expressions and deadpan snark was probably what kept this comedy skit from being overdone. <br />
<br />
From the major comedy skits, LA will quite easily say that the rest of the characters are more or less catalyst to restart the same comedic skits for the major players, it becomes somewhat worse as the minor characters hardly have impact towards these characters unless the major comedic skits intertwine with one another to start another catalyst. Higashida&#039;s parents, to Takuya Houno to Kisaki Kondou and Kenichirou Sakaki very quickly loses any kind of screentime besides being for character jabbing but nothing for impact towards the comedic skits, LA knows it&#039;s not entirely important to focus on these characters, but it just felt like wasted potential to interact these characters with one another more instead of just &quot;being the catalyst&quot;.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation, once again done by A1-Pictures, the animation in the character designs goes two ways, due to it having chibi designs for the comedic punchlines to just some moments of it just being chibi just because, but LA can give these chibi designs some slack as it really is a slice of life comedy anime. The more detailed character designs are pretty well done and compensated for the chibi designs as well. Nonetheless the animation is &quot;ok&quot; at best for a slice of life comedy anime and not much to talk about other than that.<br />
<br />
In terms of voice acting, LA will say this, as much as Miyakoshi&#039;s genkiness and obliviousness was close to an annoying feature but an odd charm to Haruka Tomatsu and really LA would have to give Haruka Tomatsu LA&#039;s favouirte voice actor from WWW.Working!!, Shiho and Sayuri (Sora Amamiya and Yoko Hisaka respectively) gave a typecasted performance and all the rest of the voice cast did pretty well with what they were given...again not much to talk about besides Haruka Tomatsu really.<br />
<br />
The comedic skits resolution also have some widening scale of satisfying to anti-climax during the final episode, mainly the satisfying resolutions going to Sayuri &amp; Adachi along with Yuuta and Shiho&#039;s were pretty much worth it, the only one that felt anti-climaxed and forced was Miyakoshi and Higashida&#039;s..but this is merely LA&#039;s perspective so it&#039;ll probably be different for others nonetheless.<br />
<br />
WWW.Working felt like it fell into the same pitfalls and strengths the original series went through to the point LA could say nothing but it just felt like WWW.Working had new characters, new skits but same old WAGNARIA, it has it&#039;s flaws and strengths and it balanced out that WWW.Working didn&#039;t succeed or fail to it&#039;s original series, it&#039;s essentially the same thing under differing characters and their crazy repetitive antics. If you liked the original series, then have WWW.Working a try to see the same thing really.

    Well, I managed to finish the anime. tl;dr It felt like a simple cash grab.<br />
<br />
Like many others I&#039;m sure, I was excited for this anime. I watched and loved the original Working/Wagnaria anime. But this is just sad. WWW.Working started off on a weak, forced note. And ended on an even weaker one. <br />
<br />
From the start you&#039;re introduced to a very flat and lifeless protagonist. There&#039;s not a lot to say about him. His character development consists of eating chocolate and becoming more lifeless. <br />
The other characters are mostly uninteresting. Some seem interesting at first, like the single mother, Kisaki. But there&#039;s no real development.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236501">
        <br />
Miyakoshi is at times funny and cute but is mostly a botched Inami. Albeit a bustier one. <br />
<br />
The comedy consists of running gags... And awkward pauses. <br />
There&#039;s also a much heavier focus on romance this time around. But it&#039;s rushed and doesn&#039;t really feel like it should have been a focus. <br />
<br />
And finally, since there really isn&#039;t a lot to say. The ending screams, &quot;not getting a sequel!&quot; <br />
<br />
SPOILER ALERT! 6 months later some of the girls have different hair and some things happened. The end. <br />
<br />
Overall I&#039;d say I did enjoy the show. I never had to force myself to watch it. Had it not been carrying the name &#039;Working&#039; I wouldn&#039;t be complaining so much. It wasn&#039;t outright bad after all. It just doesn&#039;t feel like any enthusiasm went into it at all. <br />
I would recommend this anime. Not strongly, but I would recommend it. Just know what you&#039;re getting into first.

    WWW.Working!! is the spin-off of the romance/comedy series Working!!<br />
<br />
I must said quite disappointed to know that there is not even a single character from the older Working series show up in this anime but its actually not that bad, we&#039;ll talk about that more later but lets talk about the storyline first.<br />
<br />
In the Working season 1 the main ah.... the main heroine who um.... I try not to give away spoilers but.... ok fu*k it.<br />
<br />
*Spoiler*<br />
<br />
There ok, the main heroine who is ended up with the main protagonist has a phobia to men its called androphobic. This is one of many inside joke that Working season

          <span style="display: none;" id="review237859">
        one use but there is still a whole lot of inside jokes, not have many drama and I don&#039;t saw many sadness in the anime too so they quite focus on the comedy and romance part.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t want to give away the ending but I just said at the end everyone is happy, but it took 3 seasons to make that ending. That&#039;s why when I watch that last episode of the 3rd season I&#039;m glad because its over I was just really satisfied to know that the ending its not sad nor disappointing.<br />
<br />
Ok that&#039;s enough for the original Working now let&#039;s talk about this newest series of Working. In this one all of them, ALL of them is new characters not even one of them show up in the older series of Working, nor the older character of Working show up in this new spin-off.<br />
<br />
Just like I said in the beginning is not really that bad, because to be honest I&#039;m glad they don&#039;t stick with the old jokes, they made new one. every girl in this anime have some sort of uniqe weakness(?) one of the girl is really rich but still working as a waiter, one of of girl can talk and see ghost, and one of the girl is really bad at cooking.<br />
<br />
And all this girls have a uniqe inside jokes with their partner just like in the original Working but with new joke and new characters.<br />
<br />
All the working series have almost a same type of OP. The OP its always happy and just like fun times happening. you can say that this is uniqe for this anime.<br />
<br />
The characters its suited perfect with the story and the animation is really good too.<br />
<br />
Well the anime is not bad but not that good either. It is really entertaining but I thought they could do more.<br />
<br />
And this is just an opinion of me but I think they will not make another season from this new spin-off. You could totally understand if you watch the last episode of WWW.Working.<br />
<br />
And just FYI, you don&#039;t have to watch the entire seasons of Working!! just to watch this anime because this anime have nothing to do with the older ones.<br />
<br />
I hope this will help, I always enjoy laugh myself out. I hope you did too when you watch this anime.

    *Spoiler Free <br />
*Enjoyment Rating: 7<br />
<br />
WWW.Working!! is a spin-off of the memorable Working series. I will be reviewing this anime separately from the original series, but there will be comparisons. Overall, this anime is extremely laid back and attempts to pull inspiration from the popular aspects of the original series. But because of these attempts, I personally feel as though this anime cut through potential plot emphasis and butchered character development. Nonetheless, I still found this anime to be entertaining overall.<br />
<br />
*Story Rating: 7<br />
<br />
There isn&#039;t anything specifically unique or amazing about this anime&#039;s plot. Personally, I found side character stories to have been far more entertaining than

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243552">
        the main one. The focus on romance in this spin-off was incredibly generous in comparison to the original series. This focus can be both a good and bad thing. It&#039;s good because Working fans are given more emphasis on the ships that they&#039;ve been waiting for that were so appealing in the original series. It&#039;s bad because it places too much emphasis on the relationships to the point where the series feels incredibly rushed. Still the comedy genre is the main strong point that makes this anime worth watching.<br />
<br />
*Art and Sound Ratings: 7.5<br />
<br />
I found both the art and sound of this anime to be incredibly average. But I do enjoy the simplistic art style of it all. For some characters, watchers can see a combination of the original cast mixed into one.<br />
<br />
*Character Ratings: 7<br />
<br />
I personally felt like the character development of this anime was butchered heavily. All but for the exception of one of the female characters really changed throughout the series, whereas the rest were fairly stuck in their ways. I found that several of these characters, like their character art designs, are combinations of past characters. Again, I feel as though this is the creators&#039; attempt to maintain a story that is familiar but still different as it contains the popular aspects of the original series. Nonetheless, characters were entertaining overall.<br />
<br />
*Overall Rating: 7<br />
<br />
I personally give this anime an overall rating of 7. In comparison to its predecessor, this anime tried a bit too hard to be as good as the original. However, it still maintained a romantic comedic familiarity that Working fans would enjoy.
