    A teenage girl struggling with her interpersonal skills; a loyal man struggling with his intrapersonal skills. Inu x Boku SS tells of the tale involving these two troubled persons. Over time, it is inevitable that one will change depending on his/her surroundings. The influences that come from peers and others are undoubtedly strong. To be able to thrive in such environments, one must be able to filter these influences and only be changed by those which they feel will benefit them. In the end, it is always others that do the shaping; one cannot merely wish to be transformed and have it happen. Whether these

          <span style="display: none;" id="review57741">
        changes are good or bad is a whole different story. <br />
<br />
Art (8/10)<br />
Soothing and calming visuals are few and far between. The light colors, the soft lighting, the detailed facial expressions of the characters - all these make for great artwork. Throw in some chibi drawings of the characters during the comedic scenes and the varying art styles are sure to impress viewers. Even the sparkles which are popular (and often overused) in shōjo anime/manga were moderated such that they didn&#039;t feel overwhelming. On the shōnen side of things, the handful of battle scenes and transformations were animated smoothly as far as I could tell. <br />
<br />
Characters (8/10)<br />
First off, the supporting characters of the series, though unique and interesting, were a bit underdeveloped. However, the extensive character development of the two main characters made up for this. At first, the female protagonist, Shirakiin Ririchiyo, is your typical, sharp-tongued teenage girl who often unintentionally isolates herself from others. But as the series progresses, she slowly opens the door to her heart, accepting the warmth of those around her while trying to control her tongue. On the other hand, the male protagonist, Miketsukami Sōshi, is a self-despising and deceptive man who knows nothing about emotion and feelings. But, similar to Ririchiyo, he too changes drastically throughout the series. What&#039;s most heartwarming is that the two, although having totally different personalities, are actually the ones responsible for each other&#039;s development. Ririchiyo shows Sōshi the meaning of emotion and feelings while he proves to her that he will be by her side, no matter what, even if it means being verbally abused. Along with the other characters, the two end up transforming each other for the better, resulting in two solid characters. <br />
<br />
Sound (8/10)<br />
The strong point of this category is the elite cast of seiyūs that were part of the project. All of them did an excellent job in their respective roles, with no character having an unfitting voice. The OP was quite good as well - a fast-paced song with gradual progression in pitch. The downside of having multiple EDs is that only the good ones will be memorable. However, the ones used in this series were more or less unique so, even though they weren&#039;t exactly excellent material, they were somewhat memorable. BGM did its job well, with some of the pieces successfully standing tall on their own during dialogue-less scenes, while others set the mood well. <br />
<br />
Story (6/10)<br />
To put it bluntly, for the most part, the story was boring. Save for the first and last few episodes, the pace of one manga chapter per episode caused the story to be dragged out longer than necessary. Furthermore, the anime original fillers were fairly poor in terms of entertainment value. The first couple of episodes were tolerable given that they were used to introduce the characters and the plot. In the last couple of episodes is where the plot actually picks up from the first few episodes. Those two episodes alone would make for an easy 9/10 as they were both interesting and content-filled. However, with more bad than good, the story gets a 6/10 from me. <br />
<br />
Overall (7/10)<br />
Having read the manga prior to watching the anime, I can say that this was a faithful adaption with a couple of original episodes added in. I indulged more in the characters than in the story for the most part which, although not necessarily a bad thing, is slightly disappointing. To be honest, I wasn&#039;t quite satisfied with Inu x Boku SS. I felt like it could&#039;ve been better if more chapters were to have been adapted. With that being said, the possibility of a season two, which I will anxiously wait for, is moderately high given the decent popularity of the show and the remaining non-animated source material. The good thing about Inu x Boku SS is that it has both shōjo and shōnen elements so I would recommend it to virtually anyone looking for a light-hearted romantic comedy with interesting characters.

    - This review may contain spoilers -<br />
<br />
When this anime first started airing recently I was unsure what it was going to be about. At the end of finishing this series, I still am unsure what this series qualify as. Inu x boku was supposedly a comedy story incorporating some supernatural and mysterious themes. However, it seems like the director changed their mind during the middle of the series.<br />
<br />
The main plot follows around a young woman named Ririchiyo. Basically, she&#039;s a very delicate person, so delicate and shy that she can barely express herself. In fact, to the point where she almost expresses the opposite of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review57447">
        what she means every time. Thus, she has no friends at school. But then one day she moves to a new environment where her lifestyle is replaced by supernatural beings. But that&#039;s all there really is &quot;supernatural&quot; about this series. Besides just the characters, nothing is distinctively different about inu x boku, than if you compare it to a cheesy school drama. Also, it can barely qualify as a  mystery because no suspense was really built throughout the series. This series was very slow paced in this aspect.<br />
<br />
The characters were the only unique part of this series. Ririchiyo along with some supporting characters have some very interesting conversations. And, with Ririchiyo&#039;s personality, it just makes it so much more fun to watch. The comedy included in the show was based mostly on the stupid conversations, thoughts, fantasies, or actions some character started. It will fit the taste of basically anyone with a sense of humor. But don&#039;t be fooled! There really is only one character development in this series. His name is soushi, and a servant of Ririchyo&quot;sama.&quot;Not very much is known about soushi except that he has a strange attraction to his master until the very last few episodes, and that is why I think the characters turned out a lot worse than they could of. This goes back to my point about the series being seriously paced; therefore making it an anime not everyone will like. But this anime is 12 episodes so it&#039;s not a big deal.<br />
<br />
The artistic aspect of this series was probably the strongest. The producer made the characters with very cute designs, thus making the audience more connected to the characters. The delicacy put into Ririchiyo almost made it express her personality better. The music put into this anime was worth some efforts, and could be very favorable. But what I liked most about it was that they played it during some of the most appropriate scenes and it complemented very well.<br />
<br />
The results of inu x boku was definitely unexpected than what it seems to be on the surface. Although not what I expected, which was a mysterious drama about the supernatural of some sort. This series still impressed me in the end concluding with a relationship I did not think would blossom in just one season. However, it was still very slow paced for that one season. So if you&#039;re looking for an anime with character developments, you may or may not like it.<br />
<br />
 I will end it in this paragraph and keep this review short and clean. Because that&#039;s what this anime really was, a short and innocent story about our kind Ririchiyo and her adventure with her air-headed friends in the Ayakashi mansion. To be precise, that&#039;s exactly how this anime played out until the last few episodes, then it&#039;s all out surprises. If you&#039;re going to watch this series, do keep in mind the old cliched saying &quot;never judge a book until you&#039;re done reading the whole thing.&quot; But if inu x boku really was a book then I&#039;m pretty sure it could be described as one of those trending books that becomes famous after its first publish, soon to be forgotten as the decade carries on.

    Does a very good job on sticking with the manga. Luckily the manga is ahead so for those like me who have read the manga way before the anime was released you know how things turn out and you can focus on the artwork and seeing your favorite characters in motion :3<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: There really isn&#039;t a &quot;story&quot; per se. The manga is slowly picking up but as you can see from the first 11(?) episodes released currently it&#039;s mostly the main (what? 6-7 characters?) conversing with each other and little things between Ririchyo and Soushi. 7/10<br />
<br />
Art: Very Nice. Nice style to it. 10/10<br />
<br />
Sound: The OP

          <span style="display: none;" id="review56897">
        is beast. It just goes so well with the animation. If you don&#039;t understand then read/watch the show/manga and then re-watch the OP and tell me if you understand how it flows so well with the animation. 10/10<br />
<br />
Character: The characters are nice. Loyal bodyguard who has a past with the protagonist, tsundere protagonist, friends, etc etc. Everyone is suprisingly nice. There are times when certain people seem like &quot;antagonists&quot; but there really is no &quot;bad guy&quot;. 10/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: It&#039;s a light refreshing series to watch. I high ly recommend reading the manga thought since it has the anime + more. 10/10<br />
 <br />
Enjoy :) see you in my next review<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Apparently me stating that this review was created at the time of the eleventh episode, the fact that I put &quot;12 out of 12&quot; for the MAL version of when I wrote this is bothering certain people. I understand completely what these people are complaining about. Why should I be limited to 12 out 12? Why not give me 20+ out of 12. I have knowledge on the manga which surpasses the limits of the animes episodes. Therefore 12+ is all free game as stated above. It doesn&#039;t matter what happens in episode 12 or 50 for that matter. That&#039;s like reviewing a restaurant that you&#039;ve been to before anyone else had the chance. I&#039;m allowed to review it however I want. I&#039;ve sampled the dishes before the general public.<br />
<br />
you feelin me?<br />
<br />
ENJOY THE SERIES.

    Inu x Boku SS<br />
To clarify i haven&#039;t read the manga and after i finished the anime i was reading comments that the story is a lot more different from the manga and i read a little about the manga and i agree is way too different, it has more of a tragic approach and the anime is more comedy, even in the serious parts something funny happens, but because i have just watched the anime and not the manga i liked the anime a lot, maybe because i laughed a lot and really enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The story is about a girl (Ririchiyo, who in fact is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195790">
        a Youkai) who wants to be alone in this special mansion, because she tends to make people go away with her harsh words, she then meets this man in this mansion (Soushi) who appeared all of a sudden and tells her that he will be her SS, she wants to make him go away but she fails because he knows her from a long time, but she can&#039;t remember and that&#039;s where their relationship could seem close but it&#039;s distant at the same time. The story was good, but from what i read from the Wikipedia characters, it could have been outstanding and thought &#039;&#039;why didn&#039;t they adapted the things like that?&#039;&#039; tho i didn&#039;t change my score on the story because of that, it&#039;s just that it was just good for a supernatural rom-com, nothing new to see but keeps you entertained, overall was good.<br />
<br />
[Art &amp; Animation<br />
The art style and animations were very well made, nothing much to say, i liked it and felt it was very good.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The music was great, the background music matched the moments and were really enjoyable, the VA and the OP were great, there are different ED and all of the were really good, specially the one from Ep. 5, that one was hilarious, overall was great.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
The character development was really good, they were really memorable even tho they have weird names you can remember their personalities and all of them were funny and interesting.<br />
-Soushi could seem the typical guy who is in love or tries to be the kindest guy with the girls but he&#039;s not, and sometimes maybe you feel he&#039;s too kind for your blood to handle but that kindness is presented with comedy and it was ok and i was surprised but kinda expected his back story.<br />
-Chiyo was really good and you can feel the chemistry between Soushi and Chiyo.<br />
-Karuta for some reason was adorable.<br />
-Natsume is funny whenever he talks.<br />
-Rensho was damn hilarious and the music they put on him everytime he transforms made it even funnier.<br />
-Kagerou was funny with his S and M division of things, and the support characters with their little on screen time were funny too, but it wasn&#039;t perfect and it showed at times, overall is very good.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
I have to state that the comedy is a strong point in the anime for you to enjoy it and the romance was satisfaying even tho it&#039;s almost at the end, not to mention the music and characters made it more enjoyable; It has flaws and if you have read the manga obviosly you won&#039;t like it because the story has a lot of changes for the anime to be more happy, the ending was good and i wanted to see more after seeing their dialogues, the OVA is really great, go watch it too, overall the enjoyment was very good.

    Inu X Boku SS was one of those anime&#039;s i had seen around, or saw some tiny references to, but it never gave me any incentive to watch the anime and it seemed to me like it was one of those anime that focuses to much on fan service and comical stuff. That being said after having not a lot to watch i gave it ago. <br />
<br />
Story 7<br />
<br />
The concept itself was ok, nothing special, your typical romcom anime. The story had a slow start, i didn&#039;t feel particularly pulled into the story until about episode 11 where Miketsukami past was revealed the episodes inbetween i

          <span style="display: none;" id="review69729">
        felt was purely fan service and it was there to make viewers laugh, and believe me it did =D. The ending i thought was pretty nice, although it did feel a bit rushed but it was quite heartwarming and im sure romance viewers will like it. But one thing that annoyed me was that episodes 3-10 was basically just introducing a bunch of characters, and Shirakiin being all like &quot;Oh i need to repay and thank Miketsukami&quot; and when it did happen Miketsukami was all like &quot;I don&#039;t deserve your thanks&quot;... what the fuck is up with that just accept her appreciation <br />
  <br />
Art 7<br />
<br />
The art in this wasn&#039;t bad for an anime that came out in 2012 its to be expected, i quite like some of the character design, Miketsukami fox form is pretty cool, so is Shirakiin&#039;s demon form or w/e she looked pretty kawaii. I absolutely Love the character design for Zange chan the bunny ears just works so god damn well, completely suits his personality and really draws out the comical moments from him. Renshou demon form is pretty jokes, his scroll look is pretty funny and provides quite a lot of priceless moments in the anime.<br />
<br />
Sound 6<br />
<br />
The OST wasn&#039;t anything special, although this isn&#039;t exactly an anime that really focuses on music, Each character had an opening and ending, which is pretty cool in my opinion, some of the voice actors was pretty good, Zange chan, Shirakiin&#039;s voice actor worked pretty well and really suited them. But this anime isn&#039;t really focused on the sound its more about the comedy it provides.<br />
<br />
Character 7 <br />
<br />
There was a wide variety of different characters each with a personality that made this anime pretty funny, Shirakiin with her bad habit of being rude to others led to some rather comical moments, that coupled with Miketsukami, who is totally in love with her is quite funny. I loved the bits when she calls him a dog and he basically acts like one =P. I Love Zange chan personality, that sarcastic attitude yet trying to act nice and innocent is pretty jokes, and his &quot;Love&quot; is way to over the top, man his love for Miketsukami is jokes. Even though i like all the characters in Inu X Boku SS it seems that there is a major lack of character development, not much is said about some of the characters past, and there doesn&#039;t seem to be a lot of character development between some of the side characters and Shirakiin for example her relationship with Nobara isn&#039;t very developed considering shes one of the first side character Shirakiin meets. It seems that the only 2 character that got the most attention was Shirakiin and Miketsukami but i guess they are the main characters, the romance between them was pretty nice as well, i would&#039;ve liked to see more about zange chan and the others, especially Sorinozuka and his past.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 8<br />
<br />
This anime, is one of those ones which is just filled with comical scenes with the slight serious scenes the only really serious episodes was after 11. I quite enjoyed it interms of i was laughing quite a lot, even though most of the jokes seems to be based around the same thing taking the piss out of Banri, or Shirakiin&#039;s bad habit even though its so repetitive i cant help but still laugh =D, Miketsukami&#039;s love for Shirakiin or Nobara&#039;s pervertedness is just hilarious and will surely make you laugh your head off.<br />
<br />
Overall 7<br />
<br />
Overall it was an ok anime it&#039;s your typical comedy romance anime, where its filled with loads of comedy and then right at the end it hits you with romance. I personally quite liked the plot of the story but there wasn&#039;t really much development of the main story which is the problem i found with this anime =/. If you want to watch an anime that&#039;ll make you laugh your head off, then Inu x Boku SS is definitely something for you.

    Inu x Boku SS or what others may refer to as - Dog and Me.<br />
Adapted by the manga Inu x Boku SS. It′s not too long ago when I read the manga, but when I found out that there will be an anime, I thought of trying to watch it until it comes out. Honestly, it made me a little bit impatient. Because I really wanna see the animated version sooner.<br />
And of course, my hopes didn′t let me down. As I thought, the animated version is great and much like-able.<br />
<br />
If you are reading the manga, and currently at the latest chapter. You might be impatient

          <span style="display: none;" id="review53041">
        in waiting for the latest episodes of the anime to come out, why? It′s easy. It′s because of the scenes in the manga which is really making the anime fans (of InuBoku) to be impatient, they would want the scenes in the manga to be animated faster; and I am one of them.<br />
<br />
- Inu x Boku SS isn′t an anime that′s out-of-the-ordinary. It′s just like some Supernatural anime, but with a bit of Romance and light comedy (just a really light comedy). Living in a apartment complex, in which you have neighbors, who are not what you would call &#039;normal&#039;. Instead, you have neighbors who is a demon, a nine-tailed fox, a giant skeleton and a whatnot. That′s a new pace for some watchers.<br />
But I think that it′s mainstream -- no?<br />
<br />
The story start′s of at a flashback, yes, flashback. I must say that these flashbacks which starts the story is really good. It makes you understand the story more and tell what′s the cause or reason of the problem. Flashbacks are kind of annoying, especially if it doesn′t have a connection or whatsoever from the episode of the storyline. But in InuBoku, it has a connection from the story, related to a past of the character.<br />
<br />
- InuBoku′s animation or art is rather light and soft. It′s not very unique, nor plain. But the art is just normal. The characters are really well-drawn, especially the guys or the bishounens. And the girls are cute too. It does have some flaws in it, but I can′t just point out where. Sometimes, the characters are drawn as chibis, when they are performing a light joke/comedy on-screen. Mostly, Ririchiyo′s the one who is drawn as chibi.<br />
<br />
The coloring fits perfectly to the characters, what I meant to say was, the hair color of the characters and other body parts which is easily seen. What catches your attention the most, that is.<br />
<br />
- InuBoku′s opening themes and ending themes were .. I don′t know what to say. I don′t really pay attention to the opening songs that much. Most likely, I just skip them. But I have heard a bit of the opening theme. It gives you a rock-theme feeling. I guess it doesn′t fit InuBoku at all, does it?<br />
<br />
- Here we have the not-admitting-it, the loyal one, the taciturn one, the pervert one, the sadist, the bad boy, the masochist one (?!), the brother-like one, and maybe a mix of everything and anything. The characters of InuBoku are all great, each and every one are most likely introduced, but not in a character introduction way. They really made quite an amusing set of characters here, all living in the same apartment complex, and of course, all of them are not normal. All of them have supernatural powers.<br />
<br />
They transform whenever it is needed, or by saving their masters, or people whom they serve.<br />
<br />
- InuBoku is an enjoyable anime, even though some of you might not like it, why not give it a go? I believe that it′ll improve and be more exciting in the following episodes. I agree that InuBoku is not an out-of-the-ordinary kind of anime, the story is not that unique either, it′s quite mainstream. But give it a little credit, why not watch it ′till it satisfies your enjoyment? Every now and then, all of us anime watchers should move on to a new pace. Having a rule like - I won′t watch an anime that is boring; yes, I agree, even though some anime are boring and a crap, you still need to give it a go and give it a little credit. It might not meet your expectation, but whatever.<br />
All in all, InuBoku is an enjoyable anime, though I′m looking forward into more excitement on the upcoming episodes.<br />

    Re review<br />
Inu X Boku SS-- ( Dog and Me) The story of this anime is about The Shirakiin house&#039;s daughter, Shirakiin Riricho, who has issues with her rich family as she is unable to do things on her own free will. Also with friends at her school too. I have this feeling her past will catch up to her.  She decides to break away from her family and life. In order for her to live independently she lives in this mansion &quot;Ayakashi Kan&quot; (House of Spirit/Demons/Ghosts/Youkai) where she meets her SS-Secret Service Miketsukami, Soushi who is her servant, guard etc. She rejects the SS

          <span style="display: none;" id="review51903">
        and him but i have feeling she&#039;&#039;s change along the way. Other members of this mansion live here and have their own personal SS. But this mansion houses&quot; people&quot; with special abilities/powers. We find out Ririchio SS is a fox spirit( at first i though OMG -Inuyasha like  demon  XD) but not really.  Looking forward for more episodes.

    So, when I watched the last - and completely unnecessary to the plot- episode of this series, my reaction was not: &quot;Ooown, how cute!!!&quot; , nor: &quot;This is an amazing anime!!!&quot; <br />
It was literally:<br />
&quot;Wait, that&#039;s it?&quot; <br />
I think that pretty much describes my experience with it, if you&#039;re not up to reading the entire review.<br />
<br />
Story: 5<br />
Maison de Ayakashi is this super elite mansion with wealthy kids that happen to be descendants from monsters from Japanese Culture. <br />
Not only that, but they also have one secret service assigned to each resident, for their protection and stuff.<br />
<br />
What may seem like a promising idea to explore Oriental Mythology

          <span style="display: none;" id="review94819">
        with some good dosis of action and adventure, turned into a mushy romance between this one girl who was socially awkward(Ririchiyo) and her rather &quot;stalky&quot; obsessive and submissive secret service agent(Miketsukami).<br />
The whole time I kept expecting some surpring twist that would actually make it… interesting.<br />
You sai t floating in between genres, comedy, romance, drama, mistery and supernatural, but it didn’t actully defined itself in the end, it was like watching someone trying to do 5 things at a time. Eventually it will go wrong. <br />
<br />
It’s not bad, I mean, is a bit of a cliché, and that really makes it a tad disappointing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 7 <br />
Okay, I gotta admit I love the character design, and the whole ambience of the anime was well captured.  The “alternate”/monster forms where rather cool and the sceneries where really appealing to look at.<br />
<br />
Characters: 6<br />
No matter how Much I love characters with proper background stories, in this case you had polar opposites. While the Ririchiyo told us almost her entire childhood, you really end the anime knowing practically nothing about the remaining characters, that are given the same importance – i level of story line – as the chairs and teacups used in the breakfast scenes. They can be kinda funny but that&#039;s their main purpose – besides the absurd ammount of fan service you get with the female characters.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
I’m givin’ it na 8 just because of all the different endings, that where not only original, but also entertaining.<br />
<br />
Overall I give it a 6<br />
It&#039;s not terrible, you can watch it at a saturday night when you&#039;re bored, but it’s not one of those titles that I would recommend watching, because honestly it wouldn&#039;t even occur to me, as all in all the story is kinda forgettable when in comparison with other animes in all the genres this one tried to be.

    I was drawn into watching this anime because of three reasons.  <br />
1. Yoko Hikasa, Aki Toyosaki, and Kana Hanazawa were cast in it<br />
2. Ririchiyo Shirakiin looked cute<br />
3. The picture I saw hinted at romance<br />
<br />
I liked how the animation style switched between normal and chibi to make the funny moments even funnier.  The story was mostly fun and light-hearted and was not about fighting like I was expecting.  They only had to fight three or four times and they were not that serious.  The story did not have that many screwed up events in it.  The worst one concerned Miketsukami but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review57545">
        it wasn&#039;t as bad as other good shows I&#039;ve seen.  (Gosick had worse for example)<br />
<br />
This anime pushed all of my buttons.  It was cute.  There was romance.  There was just the right amount of sex appeal, which was centered around Ririchiyo Shirakiin&#039;s cleavage and was sprinkled with Nobara being a creeper and Chino&#039;s chest.  <br />
<br />
The character designs were excellent.  I loved how unique and sometimes stupid, in terms of fighting ability and functionality, their transformations were.  <br />
My favorite characters were Ririchiyo, Karuta, and Chino.  I see myself in Ririchiyo Shirakiin but instead of doing that annoying, uptight &quot;humph&quot; before every conversation, I don&#039;t say anything.  We both have trouble saying what we mean and are honest when we write.  <br />
I like Karuta Roromiya because of her voice and her love of food.  Her throwback form is unexpected and awesome.  <br />
I hated and liked Kagerou at the same time.  I hated him for the type of person he was but liked and laughed so hard at him because of how he flaunted it.  I&#039;ve wondered what it would be like to be classified by him.  I have an idea of what he would say...<br />
Chino was so cute.  She acted cute, her other form was so cute, and I could hear and see Yui.<br />
The other workers at Maison de Ayakashi are diverse and funny.  <br />
<br />
I usually don&#039;t like songs sung by guys but the opening song, Nirvana by MUCC, is good.  Most of the ending songs are awesome, especially sweets parade.  SM Hantei Forum made me laugh so hard.  <br />
<br />
The ending made me so happy because I enjoy a good romance and it left the story wide open for development.  Out of the dozen shows I followed this season, Inu x Boku SS is my favorite.  Season 2 Please.

    This anime &#039;Inu Boku SS&#039; seems to point to &#039;Dog and me secret service&#039;, but, it isn&#039;t the literal meaning of course, that would be a bit boring unless you had some super cool dogs! anyway.<br />
<br />
The story is based on a girl named Ririchiyo who lacks social skills and can never say what she really thinks. The Fox Spirit, Miketsukami Soushi is her secret service agent and pledges his life to protect her. In the beginning you feel like there is an underlying story behind his commitment or a reason for his attitude towards his job.<br />
<br />
Even though she is projected, I feel that the main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review168797">
        character is Soushi, as he commands a certain presence in this anime that drags attention to him. Even if the anime focuses on her problems and how she evolves to make friends, it is really his character that it interesting.<br />
<br />
After finding out about him, it is like that we would go back and watch the series again, just to find out where he gives cues about his life and his reasons.<br />
<br />
It goes a bit slow when it focuses on her;  and then heats up near the absolute end only because you want to know what will happen!!<br />
<br />
Overall, I liked the anime as the ending was sort of expected but, the end scene was a bit cliche I feel. Anyway, the art of all the transformed ayakashis are really good!!! Love the little horns on Rirchiyos head :P<br />
<br />
Not too much action though, sort of wished there was a fight where we couldn&#039;t decide who would win! well, that was there but it ended unexpectedly.<br />
<br />
Anyway, enjoy and pay attention through out the anime for little hints ;)

    So I am not quite sure why some people are not so happy with this series.  I thought it was very sweet and enjoyable, and I really really liked it.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
While the story was not an overarching plot-line, nor was it extremely deep, it was very enjoyable.  This series was more of a rom-com than anything else, but it definitely had some drama to it, and the supernatural aspect of it actually worked to enhance the story overall.<br />
<br />
Art: <br />
Nothing special or extraordinary in the art department, but the series had beautiful, bright colors, and the characters were unique and beautifully drawn.  The art

          <span style="display: none;" id="review170931">
        is a teeny bit &quot;bishie&quot; but it works quite well, no complaints here.  <br />
(as a side note, while there isn&#039;t a TON of fan service, there are definitely a few scenes that are NSFW)<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The soundtrack wasn&#039;t too memorable, but there were a few pieces that were beautiful and added to certain scenes.  <br />
<br />
Character: <br />
This is where the series really shone for me.  I was able to connect and related to Ririchiyo and her social awkwardness and inability to connect with people due to a dark childhood.  Miketsukami on the other hand is a bit harder to get a read on at first.  He seems slightly perverted and is definitely obsessed with Ririchiyo, but we don&#039;t really know why until the last few episodes.  But you can&#039;t help but like him and have a soft spot for his kindness towards Ririchiyo.  By the end of the series the character development is phenomenal (especially for Ririchiyo).  I ended up loving both Ririchiyo and Miketsukami, and the side characters are lovely and memorable as well.  The side characters have a ton of diversity as well: there is a Trans character, two gay characters, and lots of different family situations, which is very impressive and definitely added to my enjoyment.   <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Overall I enjoyed this series a lot.  I thought the story was sweet and the characters are wonderful to watch.

    &quot;The time you have lived thus far; we will remember it, again &amp; again, the story of a long, long time we will live out together&quot;<br />
<br />
Inu x Boku SS is one of the series that made a lot of us, laugh, cry, and smile all at the same time. This is one of the greatest and almost beautiful love story I have seen in a very, very long time.<br />
<br />
First of all let&#039;s start with the storyline...well, there really wasn&#039;t any at all. But this really follows the manga so well, I&#039;d almost say they got it word for word! The first episode describes a young

          <span style="display: none;" id="review57323">
        sixteen year old girl named Ririchiyo who is moving into an apartment on her own. Serving her &quot;until the death&quot; is Soushi, a young, mysterious man that seems almost emotionless. Though the first part of the series the storyline seems to be not picking up and I was starting to lose interest until BAM, it hit me like light and I was hooked for the rest of the season. The series also accompanies many other characters that have a personality all of their own.<br />
<br />
The art was simply beautiful, it gives us everything, including detail, emotions, and the feeling of the characters. Watchers may find themselves feeling the same emotion as the main girl Ririchiyo (in which she goes thought some confusing mixed feelings continually throughout the series). <br />
<br />
As I first said a couple paragraphs before this, almost all of the characters pull of many moments that create a sense of personality. One thing I absolute hate about some Anime is that some characters seem &quot;robotish&quot; or &quot;no personality&quot; and that&#039;s clearly out right BORING for me. I find myself itching for some personality or at least some creativity of some sort I can relate or want to relate too and this anime delivers it luckily.<br />
<br />
Overall, absolute LOVE ♥ Once you finish this whole series you find yourself feeling all fuzzy inside and that&#039;s a promise! I recommend watching this if you want some romantic comedy and girls, if you have a heart that is dying to melt watch this! I guarantee you won&#039;t regret it~

Tagged, romance, comedy, supernatural, shounen.  Romance is a fail. Comedy is a fail. Shounen I am not sure about. About the only thing it manages is supernatural and not even sure I should give it that. About the only thing you give Inu is that it&#039;s animated. <br />

Lets start with the characters. They&#039;re awful. I mean really awful. If their dialog was part of a Turing test, everyone would assume they were badly made chat bots and laugh at their lines.  Nominally the series is meant to be about their romantic entanglements,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328182">
        but as you watch them interact homicide is much more likely than romance. Heaven knows I thought they all needed to be killed just to make certain they didn&#039;t pass on their genes. <br />
<br />
The story goes no place.  It&#039;s literally about watching ridiculous people unable to make decisions, unable to take action, and endlessly obsessing over ever smaller things, that the viewer can only care less and less about.  <br />

What where did that come from ?  Yeah there&#039;s another story that also makes no sense. I could never figure out what what was going on or why it was happening, but it was there and thoroughly random.<br />
<br />
<br />
You combine irritating characters with a story that&#039;s bad  and you have Inu X Boku. Do yourself a favor and avoid.<br />

    There is something very unfortunate about a show that chooses to confirm certain traits and elements of the story that the viewer sometimes wanted kept to the power of the imagination. <br />
<br />
One of the most important things to get out the way when watching this show: The place and role of the main characters, in this case the male and female leads, Miketsukami Soushi and Shirakiin Ririchiyo. Miketsukami is a 22 year old incarnation of the Kyuubi, the fox spirit, and Ririchiyo is a 15 year old high school student. Keeping in mind that this is a clear 7 year difference in age, one cannot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181021">
        blame the casual anime watcher feeling a bit uncomfortable in a situation like this. Seeing as how Japanese culture views older male partners coupling with younger girls and women as acceptable, this is not a fault within the show itself. Although again, it may be odd to some, hence the confusing mix of feelings one feels as he/she completes this show. I say a confusing mix, because Inu x Boku, admittedly, presents a very solid storyline that fulfills its goals and generally feels satisfying. The characters are fleshed out, the humor is original, the animation is very good, and the situations are unique to themselves. There would seem to be a paucity of complaints, but it is because it is such a solid show that problems arise. <br />
<br />
The big one, and this may not be a problem to most (much more of a personal problem). The age gap between our respective love couple. The reason for such discontent with the romance aspect of this show is because the show presents such a deep past that links together with the present to create a meaningful, not-spur-of-the-moment love that is justified in all sense. The feelings of loneliness, lost identity, and the need for &quot;reciprocation&quot; between one another in the process of healing, are all perfectly identifiable and explainable in every sense. As people, the love is honestly genuine. But yet, I just can&#039;t seem to rid the thought of, &quot;What if the age gap was a bit smaller? Would it feel more... relatable? More &#039;romantic&#039;?&quot; Of course, all of this rests on the subjective opinion that the closer you are in age, the more likely you are to understand your loved one. It may be true in some sense, but the show sets up the plot so that it proves such an idea otherwise, which I find impressive and also a bit frustrating. For me, at the end of the last episode, it felt unbalanced even when the show went to great lengths to make sure that it didn&#039;t. <br />
<br />
&quot;Happiness from love transcends age difference&quot;. I wonder then, where the line is drawn, if at all? <br />
<br />
One thing Inu x Boku had going for it was the small cast of interesting SIDE characters. Although their own stories were trivially small compared to the main leads&#039;, it kept the show moving and respectably created an atmosphere full of personality and purpose. Aside from the &#039;main&#039; side characters(yes, main side characters), some of the side characters made relatively few appearances, which wasn&#039;t a problem necessarily. But, I would have liked to have seen all of them more equally. However, the interesting personalities of the characters that DID make recurring appearances were enough rapports to continue on the main storyline. <br />
<br />
Perhaps the personality of the main male character simply did not resonate with me, but I found his obedience and extreme level of devotion somewhat dull and expected. It became a punchline that quickly grew old a few episodes in, and I felt that they could have done a much better job of refining his personality.<br />
<br />
The sound was not particularly noteworthy, and I don&#039;t remember any of the musics played. Looking back, it almost seemed like an afterthought, like it blended a bit too much into the background. <br />
<br />
Inu x Boku is an original love story, but could have most definitely stood out more than it did. Short and sweet, but nothing that popped out.  <br />

    The series started of brilliantly, with the way the main character, Ririchiyo is introduced. The way the series introduced the Ririchiyo&#039;s problems as well as the other residents at the apartment was also great. Overall, the first episode was an excellent start to the series.<br />
<br />
But then, as the story progressed on, Ririchyo changed. Instead of being some badass character who wanted to get along with everyone, she changed into a shoujo who fell in love, and the latest few episodes focused a lot on her feelings and shoujo character development.<br />
<br />
Comparing to the comedy, and the set up of the first few episodes, the latest few

          <span style="display: none;" id="review55239">
        episodes were really disappointing. It loses the comedic feel to it, and begins to show signs of some cliche shoujo<br />
<br />
According to MAL, this series has 12 episodes, so I&#039;m having my fingers crossed that the last few will become much more exciting and action-filled. <br />
<br />
Though I must add, the sound and the OST is absolutely awesome. They fit the scenes and the atmosphere very well.

     In a way, I found this anime hard to watch at times. I had a strange vibe from it that didn&#039;t really suit me. But on with the review.<br />
<br />
  The story. They could of done much more  with what they gave us, I feel they could of expanded some more on the things that we were first told in the first episode about their ancestors and such and less about the main protagonists everyday life (mainly school), that I could of done without. because they spent good amount of time each episode of the protagonists morning routine. <br />
<br />
  However, If you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review153795">
        can get those quirks out of the way, you have yourself a rather well done anime. There is one thing that really stood out with this anime, and that was it&#039;s character development. You really learn lot about most of the characters anywhere from their personalities to there past or really just anything about them, and I feel that really helped the show out.<br />
 The comedy was well done, short lived jokes but they were enjoyable to laugh at.<br />
<br />
 The art and sound I found no problems. The art wasn&#039;t anything special or finely detailed, and the sound was normal. Very average but not bad.<br />
<br />
 I gave this anime a 7 out of ten. I recommend this anime for those who are looking for a romance with a few fight scenes. Enjoy.

    I&#039;m going get straight to the point. This is my first review so ima to keep it simple. This is just my opinion. This anime was good overall. It isn&#039;t a ground breaking anime by any means but its just a lighthearted romance comedy. The female protagonist is pretty chill even though i hate tsunderes in general. What got me is the male protagonist. I hated his personality so much. He was creepy to the max. I know they tried to make his creepiness funny, but idk. It just didn&#039;t work for me. The age gap wasn&#039;t helping either. ACT YOUR AGE! Sometimes i just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review62907">
        wanted elbow him in the throat. His back story explains why he&#039;s that way but come on bruh!  The other characters were cool and funny which really made the anime enjoyable to me. The art was pleasing to the eyes. I think the art was the best part about this anime. Overall it was a 7 in my book.

    Inu X Boku SS from the very first episode I&#039;ve became addicted. :)<br />
<br />
(10) Story: The story line is fantastic! Its about a girl, Ririchiyo, who doesn&#039;t really know how to socialize with other people and by going to this dorm, Ayakashi Kan, where she meets many interesting people who she later calls friends. On her first day she meets a guy, Soushi Miketsukami, who swears to protect her as like her body guard. Soushi is very loyal like a dog otherwise referred to as the Inu. Many twists in turns happen in this anime I found myself intregued and wanting more and more each week.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review57745">
        If you like a anime where you laugh at almost all the episodes which at the same time cheering on Ririchiyo as she begins to fall in love with a certain guy in here but I will say no more or I might spoil it. The point is if your into romcoms this is the anime for you. This is a anime not only for girls but for guys. :)<br />
<br />
(10) Art: The art is amazing! I&#039;m sure most of you noticed how hot the guys are in Inu X Boku SS! xD I find that all the characters are drawn out well, I read the manga and the art is right on. I actually judge wheather I like the show or not by the image. Like if the art is crappy then I find it hard to enjoy it more without a clear picture. <br />
<br />
(10) Sound: Sounds were good and clear. I actually think their voices suited them well. <br />
<br />
(10) Character: The characters have great personalities and their looks and voices went with them very well! :)<br />
<br />
(10) Enjoyment: You will surely enjoy this anime, one episode will have you hooked and wanting more!! :)<br />
<br />
(10) Overall: Overall this anime is the best! It has everything good that you look for in a anime! It has the surprise factors, everything! I guarentee you this once you watch that very first episode you will fall in love with this series. After you finish you will be wanting more and believe you me I am! :)<br />
<br />

    At first I almost dropped this anime.  I watched the first half and told myself, another anime that has useless character interaction that means nothing to the actual story.  However I am glad that I stuck with it.  The second half of the anime proved to be worth it as a love triangle ensued.  Ririchiyo came to a new school that was for the supernatural.  She ended up getting a butler or a contracted helper named Soushi that pronounced his undying loyalty to her.  After some time they form a special bond based off of their past and realize

          <span style="display: none;" id="review59671">
        they have a lot more in common than they thought.  It was a cute little story, but I wish that the first half would&#039;ve had the effort that the second half of the anime did.

    What was I expecting when I started watching Inu x Boku SS? I really don&#039;t know, something entertaining at the very least? Unfortunately, Inu x Boku is nothing of the sort, just an episodic hodgepodge of random scenarios with little-to-no overarching plot. I&#039;m actually not sure what this was supposed to be. A romance? If so, it certainly lacked progression until the very end. A comedy? Well, it didn&#039;t really make me laugh very much, which I admit, is somewhat subjective, but the humor didn&#039;t work for me, outside of a few characters or episodes. Supernatural? I guess it had supernatural elements. Honestly, those were

          <span style="display: none;" id="review286419">
        the highlight of the show, but the supernatural powers got so little focus that they may as well have been just a plot device.<br />
<br />
Artistically, Inu x Boku is going to blow absolutely nobody away. It&#039;s rather basic in every way and is starting to look a little dated as the years pass. That&#039;s not to say it&#039;s not acceptable, but it may look really old in a few years. The big win for Inu x Boku was the songs. I really liked the opening and the changing endings, it added an air of personality to each episode, which was refreshing. Outside of those things, nothing about Inu x Boku is a technical marvel, it&#039;s only acceptable at best.<br />
<br />
Favorite Character: Kagerou Shoukiin<br />
<br />
I was a hair away from saying that Karuta was my favorite, but I had to give it to my S&amp;M dude. Honestly, his introductory episode was the funniest in the entire series, I was legit laughing out loud because of his antics. I aspire to go around labeling things as sadistic or masochistic now because of him.<br />
To be clear, I did like some of the cast, even if it&#039;s not as many of them as I would have liked. Sorinozuka, or the scroll dude, was really funny as well, especially with his interactions with Nobara, his perverted, lesbian secret service agent. Nobara in general was a hilarious character. However, I cannot say that I loved the main two characters very much. They kind of felt as if someone was like, &quot;Hey, we have these two pieces of cardboard for main characters, so let&#039;s give them a personality.&quot; and then they decided to make one piece of cardboard a self-pitying loli tsundere and the other an overly attached stalker. I felt zero connection to either of them throughout the entire series. Not once did I feel anything other than boredom when they came onto the screen. If you&#039;ve followed my reviewing at all, you know I&#039;m a huge shipper and this show didn&#039;t even make me bother with shipping characters, because they were so mediocre outside of a select few.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t even know if I&#039;m disappointed by Inu x Boku or just relieved to be done with it. To make a confession, I was kind of half asleep for the last 3-4 episodes, if not even longer, so I may have missed out on the best the show had to offer. However, I feel as if that proves my point though. Inu x Boku couldn&#039;t even command enough of my attention for a single cour, that&#039;s how bland it is.
