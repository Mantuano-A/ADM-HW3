Most people dropped the series to quickly because of the bullying in the first few episodes and calling it problematic. Throughout the entire series you can see how these characters grow and develop into something that is clearly more than a girl picking on her upperclassman. <br />
<br />
Art 10/10<br />
<br />
I LOVE this art style, I think it looks so clean and colourful; It definitely stands out. The art for the opening is also incredible and interesting to watch.<br />
<br />
Sound 9/10<br />
<br />
The opening and endings are really catchy and memorable. The rest of the soundtrack is also very fitting for the scenes they are intended

Character 9/10<br />
<br />
As stated before, most people dropped the anime too early because Nagatoro was a bully and problematic, and I will say the first too episodes may have been a little too over the top. But even after the first few episodes we can already see Nagatoro and Naoto’s dynamic change. Naoto starts to grow more confidence and is able to fire back at Nagatoro’s teasing. Nagatoro’s attitude around Naoto begins to change and is less bold with her comments, though she still likes to tease him it is in a more playful manner. I don’t have much to say about Nagatoro’s friends other than they are fun characters to watch.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed watching this and I would definitely recommend this to someone else. It’s a great and fun show and I wish more people would have given it more of a chance instead of dropping it after the first few episodes.<br />
<br />
Overall 9/10

    Ijiranaide Nagatoro-san or &quot;Don&#039;t Toy with Me, Miss Nagatoro&quot; is centered around the antics of Nagatoro, Hayase and Hachiouji, Naoto. Nagatoro constantly &quot;bullies&quot; Haciouji because she has, quite obviously, taken romantic interest in him. Being the pathetic character that he is, Haciouji is oblivious yet lets her stay by his side simply because he loves it. Yes, he loves getting pushed around and constantly toyed with. Their relationship is the same cat and mouse game that you will find in any romance anime, but with a masochistic approach. This back and forth crap of teasing and blushing continues for four episodes and will probably do

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395566">
        so for the remainder of the season. Every episode takes on the same wash, rinse, and repeat style that you will find in any other boring romance show. Watching the same episode 12 times is just as entertaining as watching 12 different episodes, it&#039;s ultimately a complete waste of your time. The jokes aren&#039;t funny, the plot is generic, the characters are stale, and the author is a hentai artist. You tell me if this show is even worth considering.

    Ijiranaide, Nagatoro-san is not a traditional romantic comedy because it is neither romantic nor funny. Rather, it is comparable to a horror movie.<br />
<br />
The horror genre appeals to people who enjoy being scared. You put yourself in the shoes of a frightened protagonist as they get chased by psychopaths, monsters, demons, etc. It’s almost masochistic how we enjoy horror. In Nagatoro-san, a teenage beta-male cuck gets tormented by a sadistic girl he has a crush on. He is repeatedly gaslit, humiliated, and manipulated by her. Similar to a horror film, it is frustrating, disturbing, uncomfortable, but strangely entertaining for a particular audience. <br />
<br />
Naoto, our virgin loser

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404679">
        protagonist, is the audience’s avatar. He is devoid of character depth. The sole reason he exists is to fulfill the viewers’ sadomasochistic fantasies. Have you ever wanted a gaudy teenage anime girl to bully you? You’re in luck. Every time Nagatoro enters Naoto’s art room, where he works on his latest painting, it is clear exactly what will happen. She will bully him. Regardless of how she goes about the bullying, it will be sexual in nature. Red flag: they’re both in high school—if that will upset you, then don’t watch it. Nagatoro acknowledges Naoto is attracted to her, and she uses that power to toy with his emotions. Giving the impression, or verbal agreement, that she wants to date him, then backing off as soon as he gives in to temptation. Just as Naoto begins to reciprocate, she pulls the rug out from under him, making him look like a fool. As a comedy, this joke isn’t funny enough to hold an entire show. They didn’t have well-written jokes in mind while making this anime. That becomes clear after the third time seeing Nagatoro pretending to strip for Naoto; then, he accidentally grabs her boobs. It is transparently fetish fuel. Acting like it but fetish fuel only makes the stale humor more unfunny. Could it have been self-aware like other ecchi anime? Yes, but that still wouldn’t have saved it from being mediocre. Another red flag: If you’ve experienced bullying, you will most likely feel repulsed by ALL of this anime.<br />
<br />
Witnessing their twisted relationship progress into romance is horrifying. The power dynamics are crucially imbalanced. If it were a friendship, there would be no problem. The thing is, Nagatoro and Naoto’s relationship is sexually charged. Seduction, partial nudity, fantasizing about each other. It is not ‘cute’ teasing like the comedy anime Teasing Master Takagi-san. <br />
<br />
Although both Nagatoro and Naoto derive pleasure from the bullying, there is a dangerous imbalance. Only the Dominant holds power in their relationship, whereas the Submissive should be able to revoke consent whenever they want. The English title, “Don&#039;t Toy with Me, Miss Nagatoro” should set off red flags immediately. Nagatoro bullies him whenever she pleases. On the other hand, Naoto never has the power to withdraw consent. Their arrangement is unspoken. There’s no safe word to pause her mortifying teasing, which makes it very bizarre seeing them together in public. Rather than coming to an agreement, as a healthy S&amp;M relationship would, she continuously bullies him until he enjoys it. While it initially seemed like they could have a symbiotic connection, it is more like an abuser desensitizing a victim until they give in to the abuse. <br />
<br />
Calling Nagatoro an ‘abuser’ would be an overstatement. She continuously manipulates and gaslights Naoto. Though, it is impossible to sympathize with him because he always falls for her blatant ploys. I felt schadenfreude seeing Naoto get shat on, but that enjoyment ran out eventually because he is intensely unlikeable. He never learned, and so the teasing never escalated past the first episode. I doubt many people like Naoto, why would they? Curiously, he becomes friends with Nagatoro and all of her friends, even though they exist to humiliate him too. They appear in random places to come and tease him. They have nothing better to do with their lives, apparently. Every female character in this is a fanservice vehicle. Their surface-level personality traits range from ‘kind of rude’ to ‘complete asshole’. Naoto even got invited on a trip to the beach with them—seemingly so they could step on him while in swimsuits. It’s not like they were pandering towards humiliation fetishes! For humor, you know? <br />
<br />
As for art and sound, it is decent but unremarkable. The environments are static; the comedic facial expressions are mostly traced and gain almost nothing from being animated. The few times the art looks good, it is a close-up on Nagatoro copied directly from the manga. Due to the nature of the source material, it requires little to no animation. Thanks to that, the character designs look adequately drawn. These designs are slightly altered from the manga; however, they look fine. Although I find flesh-fangs disgusting, if you’re into that sort of thing, then Nagatoro’s design won’t bother you. Her voice performance more than made up for it. Though many viewers will write off Nagatoro as an annoyance machine (understandably), it is worth praising Sumire Uesaka’s stellar realization of the deranged girl; every inflection and mannerism associated with the titular psycho comes to life believably. The opening and ending tracks are good, with the latter performed by Uesaka. All I can praise about the sound design is the original soundtrack’s editing, especially between flashbacks and the present day. It is most successful during dramatic scenes.<br />
<br />
This is not an anime aimed at the average S&amp;M enjoyer. Instead, it is targeted at teenage male viewers interested in dabbling in taboo fetishes without fully delving into smut. Unsurprisingly, cleavage and thigh shots are ever-present to appease the hormonal adolescent audience. Nagatoro and Naoto’s non-consensual relationship is framed as titillation for the viewer; it bears more similarities to a virgin porn addict’s view of S&amp;M. Instead of writing an accurate and informative portrayal of S&amp;M power dynamics, this is a pseudo hentai plot. Mangaka 774 could write a halfway decent romantic comedy, he certainly has the fanbase who’d devour it, but this isn’t it. Had Nagatoro-san been explicit hentai, as the mangaka’s other works, I would review it as such. Nonetheless, this is a TV anime, and you have to admit, hentai writing is kind of garbage.

    Alright I agree that nagatoro didn&#039;t have a very convincing start with the bullying and all but lets just get one thing straight.<br />
This is an ANIME not to be taken SERIOUSLY or PERSONALLY. Also this is a romance anime so we all know where this is going and &#039;senpai&#039; really doesn&#039;t mind getting bullied so we really don&#039;t need to make anything controversial out of it.<br />
<br />
Now for the story<br />
Its a nice kind of M and S relationship with limits of course and is getting very wholesome episode by episode. We have the classic anime &quot;accidents&quot; which is kinda refreshing to watch and the smug face

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401095">
        of nagatoro is just purely satisfying for me.<br />
Nagatoro seems like a tsundere , yandere mixed type of species which i have not seen before and Naoto is weak but a nice and caring guy.<br />
The side characters are also a refreshing part of this show. Its wholesome, its hilarious its all what you expected.<br />
<br />
Voice and Animation<br />
This definitely has S tier type animation and an amazing voice cast for a slice of life anime that is.<br />
The OP is banger and the ED is nice and sweet.<br />
<br />
Overall I absolutely love this show it may be slightly annoying to some but entertaining for sure!

    Nagatoro-san was a pleasant surprise. You see, I hate the character archetype of abusive tsunderes. Taiga from Toradora, Louise from Zero no Tsukaima, shit like that is just a huge turn-off and the annoyingness of the characters simply ruins the whole series. So, I was kinda expecting something like that.<br />
<br />
Turns out, this series is surprisingly wholesome. The teasing isn’t overdone and stays just like that – a teasing between two teenagers interested in each others, creating a more believable romantic setting compared to mc falling with love in girl who just beats him. What’s more, even though the protagonist is more on the passive side,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404845">
        he’s not a dumb oblivious protagonist like that of harems. His interest in ero is definitely there, as much as he tries to not let it out.<br />
<br />
Nagatoro, on the other hand, is strong with offense and dishes out (admittedly amusing) teasing, but weak in defense. This is important as it creates the whole chemistry – a protagonist who is not completely passive and a love interest that is weak to being teasing herself, resulting in situations when tables are turned and it’s super effective, creating a more “equal” position between the “couple”.<br />
<br />
While not a masterpiece, coming from a creator of femdom porn this is certainly a surprisingly cute and amusing series. Also the opening is catchy.

    The one major attraction of anime medium is that we can explore any idea, in any way possible. Ijiranaide, Nagatoro-san (Don&#039;t Toy with Me, Miss Nagatoro) explores the idea of a fiesty girl who makes it their personal hobby to bully a guy. Just imagine that. We have a show about a girl picking on a guy as a major plot element in 2021. <br />
<br />
Watching Ijiranaide, Nagatoro-san is the type of rom-com adaptation that you know what you&#039;re going to get from day one. The premise speaks for itself as Naoto Hachiouji (better known as Senpai) is teased by Nagatoro every single day. And for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404677">
        his sanity, let&#039;s just say that Senpai would have to put up with Nagatoro antics even if he can never have a peaceful day again. Based on the manga of the same name, it&#039;s clear the author wanted to entertain us in the form of an eccentric romantic comedy. I&#039;ll warn you though. If you&#039;re not into watching a girl toy a guy on a daily basis, then I&#039;d highly suggest to turn back now.<br />
<br />
Even as the title suggests, the anime itself isn&#039;t sadomastic as it sounds. Senpai isn&#039;t Nagatoro&#039;s boy toy although he is teased as part of Nagatoro&#039;s favorite hobby. The first episode gives us a deep dive into how she operates. With every witty dialogue, she manages to put Senpai into compromising or embarassing positions. Senpai&#039;s own insecure personality doesn&#039;t help him stand up to Nagatoro either. Or perhaps there&#039;s a bit more? Watching the first few episodes also suggests that at some levels, he enjoys being with Nagatoro. Through their character chemistry, there&#039;s also some levels of sexual tension. This is evidenced especially whenever Nagatoro tries to use her body to tease Senpai. Other times, she makes sexual jokes alluding to adult references. It&#039;s the type of humor that you&#039;ll see every episode. And she&#039;s not even the sole character behind acting on these schemes.<br />
<br />
Meet Gamo and Yosshi, two of Nagatoro&#039;s classmates who loves to tease and bully Senpai just as much as she does. Nicknaming our male protagonist as &#039;Paisen&#039;, they&#039;re known to call him Virgin at every chance possible. However, one interesting thing to note is that their teases sometimes irritates Nagatoro or perhaps even makes her jealous. At many points throughout the series, it shows that Nagatoro wants to keep Senpai to herself rather than letting others have him. Sure, she treats him like a toy but also wants to protect him for herself. Perhaps &#039;protect&#039; isn&#039;t the right word to use here but Nagatoro has her moments of envy whenever Gamo and Yosshi takes their teases too far. It&#039;s physically reflected in her distorted eyes, a contrast to her usual bubbly self. Does that mean Nagatoro likes Senpai? That question may be ambigious and honestly too early to tell from this season alone. Unfortunately, this season didn&#039;t have enough time for any character development for Nagatoro. It seems that the anime itself just wanted to tease the audience about Nagatoro&#039;s feelings towards Senpai. In later episodes, we see this more evident when she engages in a rivalry with President but this really goes to nowhere.<br />
<br />
With such a goofy cast and entertaining premise, you can bet this anime doesn&#039;t take itself seriously at all. The show generally follows a non-linear storytelling format with each episode playing out like skits. Each episode contains multiple parts but some of the recurring elements remains the same, most noticably being Nagatoro&#039;s teasing habits. The show also tries to throw off the audience on occasions by doing unorthodox episodes such as fantasy/isekai. Watching Nagatoro&#039;s relationship with Senpai equates to an owner playing with their toy, at least in the beginning of the anime. While the show always relies heavily on the teasing, it does get more playful later on. And of course, Nagatoro seems to be able to always find some way to tease Senpai with her clever mind. Whether it&#039;s physically or emotionally, she&#039;s the master at what she does, and is part of her DNA to tease Senpai.<br />
<br />
We should give credit to where credit is due. Ijiranaide, Nagatoro-san is known for its comedy but it&#039;s serious about its artwork style, straight out of the manga. Frames in this adaptation is consistent with character designs appealing to the way they look. Nagatoro is known for using her body sometimes as a weapon on Senpai so it comes to no surprise that the show gave her a slim figure. More importantly is the character expressions. The show adapts a highly expressive way of showing her personality whenever her emotions runs wild whether when playful, jealous, or sarcastic. Nagatoro&#039;s playful personality also includes cat traits to reflect just how playful she is. In essence, she plays around like a curious cat. On the other hand, Senpai is protrayed as a nervous character who seems to be fearful of Nagatoro&#039;s antics. Who can blame him though? If you were teased by Nagatoro 24/7, you might get anxiety like him too. This show isn&#039;t also afraid of throwing in fan service elsewhere especially with the President. Can you imagine who walks around at school with just a towel like that?<br />
<br />
Ijiranaide, Nagatoro-san isn&#039;t the first type of anime that focuses on a girl teasing a boy and it certainly won&#039;t be the last either. Here, we got this anime about a playful girl who loves to toy Senpai like her personal property. However, the big question you should ask yourself is if you want to join the entertainment with her along the way. Do you want to watch a show where the protagonist gets played around every episode? The answer can be both easy or hard to answer but if you look at the bigger picture, it&#039;s not difficult to decide. Because the fact is, this anime sells itself exactly the way it is: a huge animated meme.

    The reviews here are a good example on why MAL should disable writing a review before x episodes watched and why you shouldn&#039;t trust reviews immediately. Also that people take anime way too personal that it&#039;s problematic. Take a chill pill, it&#039;s a cartoon.<br />
<br />
This is a fun show. The first episodes might give off a really masochistic and sadistic vibe, but the later episodes it gets really wholesome. Nagatoro-san is not a story-driven anime, it&#039;s gag. There IS character progression, wich is a key part to storytelling, and this exact thing is what keeps me interested.<br />
<br />
Yes, the bullying is really bad in the first 2

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396837">
        episodes, but the anime starts getting interesting when you start to see more of Nagatoro&#039;s personality. The main character also makes some changes (great example in the latest episode) in his personality wich gives me high hopes for the future.<br />
<br />
The art is great. A big selling point of this show is the facial expressions, wich are amazing (especially the soon iconic Nagatoro-smirk). The drawings are vibrant and solid. Animation is flawless.<br />
<br />
Great opening song and the voiceacting is as it should be. Nagatoro&#039;s VA is perfect in my book.<br />
<br />
This is one of those shows where it gets better the &#039;longer&#039; you watch it. I was even surprised that it was only episode 5 and there were major (positive) personality shifts. It went from sadistic bully-porn to an awkward romance story, and it&#039;s great!<br />
<br />
The show has some lewd/questionable moments (great example was the soap scene... that was kinda cringeworthy) but it&#039;s not half-hentai. It&#039;s not worse than your average fanservice, so it&#039;s a pretty safe watch (altough I don&#039;t recommend watching it in public and/or show it to your 6-year-old nephew).<br />
<br />
BIG WARNING! THIS SHOW HAS AMONG US -REFERENCES. IF YOU CAN&#039;T HANDLE THOSE (wich I fully understand), THIS SHOW MIGHT NOT BE FOR YOU!

    After 9 episodes, I&#039;m gonna say this is an underrated anime.<br />
<br />
Yeah, yeah, we all know how this anime started, it caused embarrassment and annoyance to many people that they dropped it instantly. But if you keep watching it, you will be surprised of how the story unfolds and how great is the development of characters.<br />
<br />
In my opinion this is a romcom that has nothing to envy of any other animes of its kind. I recommend you to give this anime a try and if you gave it but then dropped it, well i recommend you to give it a second chance because its worthy.

    A boy<br />
A girl<br />
(&#039;&#039;Comedy&#039;&#039;<br />
&#039;&#039;Romantic&#039;&#039;<br />
and<br />
&#039;&#039;Slice of Life&#039;&#039;)<br />
Persistence<br />
Emotional blackmail<br />
and Bullying <br />
<br />
Just by looking at it, we know that together, under no circumstances would this work, and Ijiranaide, Nagatoro-san (Please don&#039;t bully me, Nagatoro) - very characteristic, exists to show us this in the simplest, fearless and most effective way most sadistic way possible. <br />
<br />
Adapted from the manga of the same name that started in 2017 and is in progress, created by an author with the code name 774 - (which by the way is a name (&#039;&#039;code&#039;&#039;) very simple and very characteristic too, without think hard to know that he is a creator of Hentais), which makes it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404765">
        logical for an artist to reach the point of being so despicable as to animate a work on physical and psychological torture, of the collective against a simple introverted and virgin teenager, in the XXI century for the public, which does not cover any knowledge and positive point beyond demonstrating this cruel reality of many who have suffered or suffer Bullying. <br />
<br />
We follow the adventures (for the girl) and misadventures (for the boy) of Nagatoro Hayase and his &#039;&#039;Senpai&#039;&#039; (Naoto Hachiouji), that at first sight, Nagatoro found a victim to have fun, being Naoto, the typical apparently Nerd from the classroom with glasses and hair in her eyes, and that<br />
it&#039;s also a virgin who gets embarrassed when he approaches or has some action involving women, while on the other hand, we have Nagatoro, a seemingly normal girl, but also an agitating girl (when the &#039;&#039;demon&#039;&#039; is close to Naoto) brunette from straight dark hair and brown eyes with few breasts and butt (which is strange coming from a certain person), who next to Naoto becomes a &#039;&#039;Boiling and Unstoppable Demon&#039;&#039;, practicing bullying recklessly all the time, and not torturing only he, as well as me and a part of the audience, as the other tends to like the character I can&#039;t imagine for what reason, besides being masochists, and maybe because they sympathize with his &#039;&#039;grimaces&#039;&#039;, or rather, their &#039; &#039;Cat Faces&#039;&#039;, which by the way the author wanted to use it as something funny to make the muggle public sympathize with the &#039;&#039;Skittish, Bold and Unstoppable Kitten&#039;&#039;, using this archetype as a basis to simulate a personality transference of a cat to Nagatoro, making everything &#039;&#039;cute&#039;&#039;, what it made the audience blind themselves to the main theme and take it as if it were the most normal and acceptable thing in the world.<br />
<br />
Nagatoro often abuses Naoto by emotionally blackmailing him for knowing his weaknesses, which weakens him even more and forces him to play his games and obey her, making Naoto reach his limits, which would have been the goal from the beginning of Nagatoro, making everything an infinite loop that does not cover any knowledge to the public from beginning to end, leaving only repetitions of cowardice and bullying in conjunction with a psychological torture possibly causing the evolution or transformation of a being, whether or not, to the a highest level masochist.<br />
<br />
The other characters are useless, three of them are like &#039;&#039;Nagatoro&#039;s Henchmen&#039;&#039; and serve to help bully Naoto and also serve as comic relief, their names are Gamou Maki, Yoshi and Sakura. Apart from them, we have Sana Sunomiya, the typical president of the club, the art one, whose function is to want to displace the other characters there because she doesn&#039;t want to mess. <br />
<br />
The rest of the cast that appear in the manga are also characterless and storyless like the ones seen here, which makes it worse, so don&#039;t waste your time here. <br />
<br />
(Names mentioned above were forgettable, I had to see in the MAL DB) <br />
<br />
The cat&#039;s tactic is smart, too bad it&#039;s used for such useless content. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t recommend this show to anyone, especially children, as it can be influential. <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading and see you next time.

    I Regret everything. This anime is the reason why you should not listen to people&#039;s opinions and watch what you like the most.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with the positives - The animation is very good and perfectly adapts the source material. It&#039;s not as flashy as some other anime but it&#039;s pretty satisfying. The sound composing is also nice.<br />
BUT these are all because the anime has a fairly good budget and good animation company. Let&#039;s get to the source material and the negatives.<br />
<br />
The Characters - Nagatoro is an abusive and mentally troubled girl who should learn boundaries and how to express emotions. She makes the MC cry

          <span style="display: none;" id="review398969">
        multiple times and physically and sexually assaults him. <br />
<br />
The fans vehemently defend this by saying that she&#039;s doing this because she loves him?<br />
<br />
Is she a kindergartner? A pathetic little child who can&#039;t bring herself to say that she likes him but can tease and bully him on a daily basis and hope he gets it. She indirectly makes trouble for him too as her friends also tease him and bully him.<br />
<br />
The MC&#039;s actions can be somewhat understood because he has been bullied before and has agreed to live this way but still he&#039;s kinda wuss.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve heard people say that this shouldn&#039;t be taken seriously as it is ONLY a comedy anime. I disagree. I didn&#039;t find the abuse funny. I would overlook this if there were some other interesting things going on. Jojo&#039;s doesn&#039;t have much of a plot either but people overlook it because there are more things happening. This sadly doesn&#039;t have that.<br />
<br />
What a time waste.<br />
<br />
<br />

    Ijiranaide, Nagatoro-san is a heartwarming and hilarious story that never has a dull moment. The playful tension in each interaction between Nagatoro and Senpai builds up to adorable punchlines that seamlessly blends comedy and romantic progression, making for an incredibly fulfilling romcom. <br />
<br />
Let’s talk about the romance part first. Instead of using a lazy excuse to bring Nagatoro and Senpai together, the show creates a connection that’s thoughtfully woven into their growth as characters. Episode one’s library scene and episode two’s restaurant scene establish why Nagatoro took an interest in Senpai in the first place, and their similarities highlight how her contrasting decisions are very

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404727">
        intentionally written to detail her attraction. At their core, both scenes introduce boys to Nagatoro through their art. Unlike the faceless restaurant boys music, drawing is a labor of love for Senpai. It’s something that he pours himself into, and Nagatoro picks up on his passion. She also takes note of Senpai&#039;s obvious self-insert, Siegfried, the chivalrous knight who protects Elizabeth even though he knows his love will never be requited. <br />
<br />
Despite initial appearances, Senpai proves that he can be quite similar to Siegfried. Even in the first episode, his personality shines through his anxiety and catches Nagatoro off guard. When Senpai returns her hand towel, she reacts to his consideration. When Senpai steels himself to draw her, she reacts to his confidence and determination. He’s able to overcome his anxiety and is often a lot more courageous than Nagatoro. Like his passion for art, I think it’s something that greatly interests her. <br />
<br />
Senpai has his own reasons for putting up Nagatoro in the first place. Although his tolerance seems strange, it’s shown that most people don’t even take the time to read his manga and just tease him for drawing it, whereas Nagatoro actually takes the time to read his work. If art is an expression of your soul, it would feel validating for someone to at least acknowledge it, right?<br />
<br />
The rest of the show is pretty much Nagatoro and Senpai just hanging out. The show gives no underlying excuse for them being around each other than the fact that they want to be, nor does it need to. Nagatoro tries to chip away at Senpai’s shell by way of teasing/flirting with him, but often retreats into her own shell when she loses her nerve. Ironically, much of the advice Nagatoro gives is more applicable to herself than Senpai. In between all the teasing are moments of intimacy, where one of them lets themselves be vulnerable without trying to emotionally protect themselves. These moments become more common overtime, and their entire dynamic naturally becomes more intimate. The payoff in the final two episodes perfectly capitalizes on the buildup by introducing the first big conflict in the relationship, resolving it through the connection they’ve formed. <br />
<br />
Of course, every little moment of Nagatoro and Senpai’s time together not only serves as romantic progression, but comedy as well. Something about seeing Nagatoro finding new ways to wield her beauty to make Senpai squirm just tickles. You’ll laugh along with Nagatoro as she verbally pokes and prods Senpai. Or when the tables turn and Nagatoro’s the one squirming as her friends torment her beloved Senpai. Every scene has some sort of comedic tension, made all the more memorable by how they’re presented.<br />
<br />
Whatever the scenario, the art and sound really tie things together. They’re what makes specific scenes so memorable, even relatively mundane ones. While the artstyle isn’t particularly stunning, the show makes the absolute most out of it. Character designs are appealing, the faces are expressive, Nagatoro’s smiles are absolutely infectious, Senpai’s blushes give me second hand embarrassment, everything works. The voice acting is incredible as well, to the point where I can just remember a line and grin, whether it’s from Nagatoro, Senpai, or Nagatoro&#039;s friends. The soundtrack can be overbearing at times, but the songs never feel repetitive and are just as fitting as the rest of the sound and visuals. <br />
<br />
I couldn’t recommend this show more. Beyond the well-written establishment, development, and presentation of the main relationship is something very relatable. Trying to overcome insecurities and let ourselves be vulnerable with someone is probably something we’ve all experienced. It’s a struggle that both Nagatoro and Senpai both go through as they slowly take down their emotional walls for each other. It’s a struggle that leads them to the discovery of someone special, someone who’s seen their true, unguarded selves and loves them for it. It’s a journey filled with laughter and warmth. Hopefully, we’ll all find someone to take the journey with one day, just as Nagatoro and Senpai have. <br />

    OKAY, First hear me out before you get offended by the teasing and bullying that Nagatoro does to Naoto( Senpai, if you didn&#039;t know his name)! <br />
<br />
First off, Let&#039;s get this clear, I know some people take things like this seriously, and I completely understand why people get off about this. The bottom line is give it a try.<br />
<br />
The ones who are bothered by the teasing might start liking the show after they watch a couple of episodes. Although the teasing elements remain, the show gets wholesome as it progresses! <br />
<br />
Talking bout the actual anime, The art style, and the expressions are spot on! <br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401792">
        music does a decent job in the background and adds flair to the scenes. <br />
<br />
The comedy element is present throughout the series and what&#039;s unique is that how genres and tropes they keep adding to the story. The way the actions and the emotions of the characters are animated truly makes it a pleasure to watch. So, if we just overlook the teasing and stuff, this anime is definitely something you will not regret watching!!

    Bullying, and anything similar, has always been regarded as a sensitive subject. For that reason, most anime and manga tackle this topic with a rather solemn approach, as they should. Serious issues akin to bullying shouldn&#039;t be viewed as a medium to make obscene jokes—unless you make it obvious that you aren&#039;t ridiculing the subject matter in question. Ijiranaide, Nagatoro-san seemingly does the opposite; according to a part of the audience, it treats a heavy topic like bullying in a comedic manner and makes light of it.<br />
<br />
This show isn&#039;t actually about bullying, though. In the end, despite my initial impressions, Iiranaide, Nagatoro-san turned out to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404675">
        be a weirdly heartwarming show that consistently kept me entertained. Why, though? I will explain.<br />
<br />
The first episode of Ijiranaide, Nagatoro-san is quite misleading. In it, our boisterous and tan-skinned heroine Nagatoro approaches our timid protagonist Naoto and bullies him to the point that he starts to break down. This immediately put me off from the anime to be honest, but luckily, Nagatoro&#039;s teasing—which was actual bullying at first—gradually softens as the story progresses, and after a few episodes, the series just becomes a likeable romance story between the two leads.<br />
<br />
Now, it should be noted that the author of Nagatoro-san was formerly a hentai artist, and this indeed shows in several places. Most of the scenarios that occur in the anime are risque to say the least; however, they don&#039;t really cross the line. Nagatoro-san surprisingly maintains a pretty light-hearted tone throughout its runtime that is well-executed for the most part. In actuality, this series is far from being a borderline hentai—regardless of what some people may have led to believe.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m addressing this since many people seemed to disparage the series solely based on the fact that its author previously made hentai, when in reality, Nagatoro-san is fairly &quot;clean&quot; compared to a countless amount of ecchi anime out there. Although this kind of reaction is to be expected, I find it condemnable that some people hate the show just because it&#039;s made by a hentai artist. It&#039;s one thing if you simply don&#039;t like the anime, but associating it with the author formerly being a hentai artist is completely uncalled for.<br />
<br />
Coming back to the actual review, the interesting dynamic of our main duo, Naoto and Nagatoro, is what primarily makes this series an entertaining watch. A proper sadomasochistic relationship between two of the leads isn&#039;t something that you commonly find in anime, which alone makes Nagatoro-san stand out from other similar shows. Most of the episodes consist of multiple segments, almost all of which follow the same format: Nagatoro runs across Naoto and playfully teases him while he gets embarrassed. Despite this formulaic plotline, the scenarios in each episode are usually varied enough to keep the viewers engaged—albeit there are times when this can feel a bit repetitive and lacklustre.<br />
<br />
Nagatoro is definitely the more compelling one of the main duo. Initially, it can be difficult to like her because of her overly mocking personality, but trust me, she becomes a lot more likeable later on. Nagatoro&#039;s mischiefs include taunting Naoto in a light-hearted manner, poking at him with her fingers, lightly hitting him on his head, etc. Most of the teasing basically consists of Nagatoro doing silly things like these which Naoto doesn&#039;t mind at all (probably because he is a masochist). Her intentions are fortunately far from being mean-spirited, and even when she crosses the line or goes a bit too far, she quickly catches on to it and apologizes to Naoto.<br />
<br />
Nagatoro&#039;s personality is unexpectedly very dynamic. Throughout the anime she displays three distinct personas (teasy/energetic, embarrassed, and yandere-ish), and they shift smoothly depending on the situation that Naoto is put into. All three sides of her personality are honestly quite likeable, but the latter two are especially entertaining since they are infrequent and contrast greatly with her usual teasy personality. On a side note, Nagatoro&#039;s voice actress Sumire Uesaka&#039;s contribution in this regard is undeniably notable.<br />
<br />
Most likely, you will dislike Naoto and find him to be a dull character, and I wouldn&#039;t blame you for that. There aren&#039;t many things that are unique about him as a character; he is kind of your typical introverted protagonist. Personally though, I actually liked Naoto quite a bit. Yes, he is pretty wimpy, irritating and a pushover at the beginning (some would argue most of the times), but his personality actually improves at a consistent pace as he interacts with Nagatoro. The development is admittedly very slow-paced, but it doesn&#039;t cause much problem since that&#039;s ultimately the purpose of the anime—to show Naoto gain self-assurance in a steady and meaningful way.<br />
<br />
The supporting characters do let down, though. Sakura is okay (although she can also be dislikeable at times), but Maki and Yoshi are mostly very annoying. The former solely exists to exasperate both Naoto and Nagatoro, and the latter just mindlessly imitates whatever the others do or say. Granted, these two do create some interesting circumstances by bringing out Nagatoro&#039;s yandere-ish personality, but surely it could have been done in a more tasteful method. Besides the aforementioned three, Naoto&#039;s club president Sana is the only other significant side character, and while she is not necessarily a bad character, she is introduced rather abruptly in the story.<br />
<br />
Nagatoro-san is decently animated for the most part. Although not spectacular, the animation is consistently fluid and there aren&#039;t many noticeable flaws. I do have some complaints regarding the character designs, though. Every character in the anime, besides those that I have mentioned above, doesn&#039;t even have a fully drawn face; their eyes are always covered with a shadow or not shown at all. Some might use the argument that this is supposed to signify a subtle meaning and shouldn&#039;t be taken at face value, but I find it a bit lazy nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Regarding the soundtrack, most of Nagatoro-san&#039;s background tracks aren&#039;t particularly remarkable (while there are a few that I like quite a bit), they fit in well with the playful atmosphere of the anime. The opening theme &quot;Easy Love&quot; is intentionally made to be over-the-top with the flamboyant visuals and the screechy (kind of) singing, but while I kinda disliked it at first, I didn&#039;t mind it much later on. On the other hand, the ending song titled &quot;Colorful Canvas&quot; is pretty catchy and has a calming vibe to it.<br />
<br />
Chances are that you will either enjoy Nagatoro-san as some sort of a guilty pleasure, or think it&#039;s another vapid ecchi anime with no substance whatsoever. And honestly, this is one of the few cases where I can understand both sides of the argument. Nagatoro-san is pretty much fated to be polarizing among its audience, so the controversy surrounding it isn&#039;t surprising at all. However, despite this and the fact that I&#039;m not generally fond of this kind of titles, I found myself enjoying this show a fair amount. I was surprised at myself for enjoying it this much, but in retrospect, Nagatoro-san actually does have some praiseworthy things about it—and I legitimately believe that it&#039;s a good show.<br />
<br />
Before I end this review, I would like recommend any potential viewers to watch the anime with an accepting mindset—you will probably enjoy it more that way. Also, sit through the first episode.

    I like romance animes when they are done well. Most romance animes are not done particularly well. They are usually too cliched, slow-paced, or unrealistic. By unrealistic, I mean the characters don&#039;t feel human to me. I don&#039;t believe the romance.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll admit Nagatoro had a weird first episode. The first thing I noticed was the animation. It was warm and satisfying. However, the introduction of the characters was certainly awkward. Nagatoro acting out Senpais manga was heartwarming but also uncomfortable. I can understand why people might have gotten triggered by the &quot;bullying&quot; or &quot;teasing&quot;.<br />
<br />
After the first episode, things gradually get better, which is satisfying to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403386">
        watch. Senpai becomes more confident and nagatoro starts to be more vulnerable. I also appreciated the art ;)<br />
<br />
Some episodes are better than others, but overall this show is just really satisfying and heartwarming. Its no masterpiece, but its better than most romance animes that are more highly-rated.<br />
<br />
I hope this anime gets another season!

    Damn it!<br />
I wanted to like this anime... I swear I tried my best. But, come on! Do you know the kind of manga that many people wait years or decades for an adaptation? In fact, the waiting time gets to be so long that we have lost hope of an announcement that favors an anime, even a good production. Nagatoro-San is the kind of manga that has become famous since its first publication. <br />
&quot;WOW, I&#039;ve never seen this kind of story before! How original, innovative and creative! The otaku audience needs this!&quot; ~ Well, if you are someone who has that kind of thinking, please

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404673">
        don&#039;t read this review, because what I will write here is not just a critical stance on yet another anime, but a nonconformism with a production and an investment that could be used for countless other titles, because Nagatoro-San was simply a huge waste of time.<br />
<br />
First of all, I think it is valid to point out the minimal positives for which Nagatoro is apparently recognized by its fans. The show contextualizes two characters. The first is known by his position within the show, &quot;Senpai&quot;. I will only use &quot;Senpai&quot; when I refer to him, as that is what predominates within the anime itself. He is the typical character that stars in stories where the boy is constantly teased by someone, no matter the reason. He is reserved, shy, and constantly belittled by the people around him. It is an archetype that, even though it is understandable within the shounen niche and encompasses a large portion of people who identify with it (mainly Japanese, keep that in mind), it is not a story that sticks by this. The opposite side of this &quot;tug-of-war&quot; needs to be at least interesting. Usually, the character that implicates and causes a disruption in the protagonist is the one that allows us to create a positive identification for the continuity of the show. And this character is Nagatoro. She is a year younger than her Senpai and met him in a brief incident in the Library. The two of them started to get involved in these constant jokes since then. And it is always the classic formulation: the episode has two or three scenes where Nagatoro teases and annoys her Senpai, while he does not present a stance that makes her stop with the childish girl&#039;s attitudes.<br />
<br />
Even though this is something that was once considered a cliché within the community, Nagatoto-San was one of the most current precursors of this type of story. Of course, there are several shows where this structure is present, but to a lesser extent. This show (and especially the manga) was an explosion of popularity and influenced countless stories where the setting was school life oriented, a couple of characters, and a possible combination of functional comedy and some dormant romance. Even though most of these manga do not take a step forward into a love story, it is possible to notice the daring moments these shows have, where they usually please the audience. If you are going to consider this a quality within Nagatoro-San, congratulations, it is consolidated.<br />
<br />
However, I must lament, this show is rotten! Yes, rotten! 774, the author, is known for some small works (even if they are aimed at the adult audience), and most of them also feature this teasing or submissive archetype. Nagatoro-San has this present all the time. Remember when I said that the structure has short stories within a long episode? So this structure is noticeably better utilized in a manga. Even in 4-komas it is possible to get a better feeling that the story was better crafted. Maybe with the Nagatoro-San manga it is the same thing. Actually, I am sure. It was noticeable to see that the anime lost direction when the way the short stories presented were not cool or where the slightest bit of comedy didn&#039;t work anymore. Honestly, what is a joke within the show became quite intertwined with the target audience, while it was already expected that rest who don&#039;t like this kind of show would find the anime boring or just plain annoying.<br />
<br />
Not just annoying. Repetitive, indecent, unqualified, overrated, vomitous, with no posture of improvement for the future, lacking in narrative qualities, lazy, unnecessary, despicable and on top of it all, subjective. Comedy is a pretty divergent sphere among people, and it&#039;s interesting to note that Nagatoro-San is one of the animes I notice this fissure the most. But let&#039;s face it, this show was inconvenient.<br />
<br />
I must give an addition for the situations in which Senpai is placed. Nagatoro&#039;s bullying of him may not seem like a big deal and even perceived as a joke, but it&#039;s something I must point out: no matter how you cause a disturbance in someone, it also doesn&#039;t matter how intense it is. This kind of teasing seems cool or attractive, but it is something that offends the character in many ways. Not only does he expose that he doesn&#039;t like this, but sometimes he asks her to stop. I understand that the wording of the show ends up requiring this kind of scene to happen, but it is unnecessary that it is in virtually every episode.<br />
<br />
Finally, the only things I really see any value in are the direction and the attempt to cause an interesting comedy. The anime, while flawed, at least had that minimal competence as an anime. At the same time, the overall compositions make this show somewhat acceptable at one point or another. But apart from these cheap and ridiculous makeups, I don&#039;t see a good future in Nagatoro-San. Of course, future moments can positively progress the story and overcome this beginning. Perhaps with a sequel this will be better evidenced. But in these 12 episodes I confirm, Nagatoto-San is not an anime for me.<br />
<br />
This Review may have been a bit short, but I honestly wanted to make it that way. It&#039;s even more than Nagatoro-San really deserves.

    Probably one of the worst animes I&#039;ve ever seen. The story, because it seems this thing has a story, is barely correctly written. The story is litterally &quot;Oh, I&#039;m going to bully then tease this guy. Oh, he cries. Maybe he loves me, because I love him, and being dumb with him is my way to show him how much I love him.&quot; Do you actually call that a story? I don&#039;t.<br />
<br />
I mean, the whole concept of the whole show is to do the same joke over and over again. A full anime based on the same joke, how original... Even the lamest slice of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review397893">
        life knows how to reinvent itself from time to time. Here? Nothing like that. The same cringe joke over and over again. The romance would have been a nice addition, but it&#039;s barely enjoyable, at least for my own POV. <br />
The manga wasn&#039;t that good to be honest. But the anime... At least, it has some decent artstyle. <br />
<br />
Some anime know how to deal with bullying/teasing and had some moral. Here? Nothing like that. Because, hey, you know, Senpai is not saying he hates that, so, that means it&#039;s okay.<br />
<br />
One of the best examples of anime that only live with hype and aren&#039;t capable of doing something more than &quot;decent&quot;.

    Do you like being bullied? Or perhaps feeling like a piece of shit? Well don&#039;t you worry, this show answers the desires you longed for masochist.<br />
<br />
Ijiranaide, Nagatoro-san follows Hachiouji, the protagonist of this show, as he takes Nagatoro&#039;s &quot;lovely&quot; personality. Their relationship leads to a considerable amount of unsettling scenes, as Nagatoro extends her &quot;love&quot;. <br />
<br />
The scenes are quite unsettling, if you have any respect for human beings. We have public humiliation, invasion of property, harassment, and many more &quot;kind&quot; traits. Needless to say, Nagatoro is the waifus that many of my fellow weebs have longed for.<br />
<br />
The characteristic that will attract many of us comes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395700">
        from the creator of source material -- Nanashi. This mad lad is the creator of many doujins you and I looked at last night. Needless to say, his art extends to this anime adaption and allows us to see more animated beauty.<br />
<br />
With that, my review has come to an end. Sorry if I didn&#039;t change the way you viewed the show, I wasn&#039;t trying to do that. I simply wished to share my thoughts of this show. I hope you enjoyed.<br />

    If you’ve been around online animanga communities, chances are you’ve happened upon a dark-haired, smug anime girl with a prominent flesh fang at least once. It’s become almost unavoidable with the surge of profile images featuring the titular character. At the same time, more than one viral post has been made, sometimes decrying the show’s “bullying” gimmick, but most of the time about the fanbase it supposedly attracts. The idea of this light rom-com being under so much scrutiny, to the point of crafting artificial controversies around it, is a pretty amusing one.<br />
 <br />
Even so, despite its flaws and rather loud detractors, I find myself

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404690">
        fond of Nagatoro.<br />
 <br />
The premise is simple: the titular character Nagatoro teases and messes with Senpai, a timid and unsociable student. Aside from a couple of gags, what is “teasing” rarely crosses over to “bullying”, and wholesome moments of genuine connection between the two characters are sprinkled in more and more as the story progresses. It’s a pretty simple, straightforward, and even unoriginal idea of a dynamic. So what exactly makes this one work? What managed to hook so many manga readers for dozens of chapters?<br />
 <br />
The obvious answer, as with any other romcom, is the main couple as characters, both individually, and in the sense of how these two complement each other. If you don’t understand why some people enjoy this kind of story, then the next couple of paragraphs might answer your questions.<br />
 <br />
Senpai is, through and through, a spineless and quiet one. He deals with his surroundings by simply shutting himself off – and though he’s often seen as a “victim” by the average viewer, the anime highlights his negative sides along with his positive ones. As the “quiet kid”, his internal monologue as he sees the main girl squad for the first time is defensive and exaggerated – while, at the same time, self-inserting as the hero who gets the girl in the manga he is drawing (art skill being one of his positive sides). In any case, what’s behind that quiet façade is a kid who’s socially stunted, especially when it comes to his thoughts towards women at first. That’s where Nagatoro comes in. Through his interactions with Nagatoro, who makes sure to call out and mock his more “incel” or “loner” sides, Senpai learns a thing or two about how to interact with people, and forges a bond with this bothersome kohai – a kohai who encourages his strengths (supporting his drawing and art) while (rather meanly) pointing out his weaknesses, and offering him to help work on them (like helping him get fit). One could discuss the healthiness of such a dynamic at this point, and the concern wouldn’t be completely unwarranted – but I won’t go on a tangent about that here, and simply point out the clues that Senpai is more than consenting to it. <br />
 <br />
What about “mean girl” Nagatoro? What is her appeal as a character? In many ways, she’s the opposite of Senpai. While his flawed side and negative traits are hidden deep within, she wears hers on her sleeve – that is to say, her constant need to tease and bully, masquerading as one of the “mean girls”. The fact that she stops when it gets too much (and many other clues) denote how she has a certain level of awareness about how unpleasant she may potentially be to someone. With that being the case, I believe the main draw of her character to be, for many viewers, the steady progression of her learning to be both more honest with herself, and more pleasant with other people through her interactions with Senpai. The anime, early in the story as it is, even hints at causes of such behavior by drawing sharp contrasts between her and the rest of the mean girls (for instance, in typical anime fashion, her insecurity regarding her modest chest compared to her other “mean girl” friends – a sort of visual disparity).<br />
 <br />
Of course, that isn’t to say Nagatoro is a perfect romance (a far cry from it), nor a perfect story. It makes as much fun of tropes as it indulges in them, partially due to the manga being, undeniably, a reflection of the mangaka’s interests. This is more of a “self-expression” work of fiction rather than one of “communication”, where the mangaka is (at this stage) less interested in getting across certain themes and messages, but moreso in simply expressing his own desires. That doesn’t make for an inherently bad story; however, if you come wishing for a more thematically rich throughline than what I stated earlier, you will be sorely disappointed — except for the last few episodes, where the narrative takes itself a bit more seriously, and where you might start actually thinking about these characters and their development. That is why one’s enjoyment of the Nagatoro anime hinges mostly on how attuned the viewer to that kind of duo/dynamic on a surface level. I wouldn’t blame anyone for disliking this premise or this kind of characters (though trying to frame this dislike in different ways, like unfunnily portraying Nagatoro as “the face of racists” in a repetitive manner for no real reason, is to say the least in bad faith).<br />
 <br />
The art for this anime is impressive, with occasional atmospheric shots that made me double-check if I was really watching Nagatoro. It would’ve benefited from some thicker linework, as with the manga, to make the characters look a tad better but this is only a minor nitpick. The OP is very catchy and well-made, the sound design is mostly fine. I don’t think I have many gripes with the show on a technical level. <br />
<br />
If you’re wondering whether you would enjoy this anime, ask yourself first if you would enjoy the kind of dynamic between two very flawed people as described above. If your answer is yes, and if you don’t mind the occasional romcom anime shenanigans, do give this one a shot, and maybe you’ll enjoy it more than you thought you would.<br />

    Already one of the most underrated series I have seen to date. I have a tendency to wait to review or rate an anime until it has run it&#039;s course and come to a full completion, but in this unique case I can&#039;t help myself.<br />
<br />
Story (8):<br />
<br />
Ijiranaide, Nagatoro-san is a great representation of a rare form of romance and relationship-building. While the first episode can easily leave a bad taste in the mouth, the evolution of the relationship between the two characters can be seen as both interesting and realistic. Said evolution may not be clear to many, but I suggest watching the series beyond the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401230">
        first episodes in order to see what I mean. The series is far from a core comedy, but it contains plenty of chuckle-worthy moments. I&#039;m not a fan of ecchi in the slightest, yet the interactions between the characters and the progression and turns of the story has kept me glued. Emotions exist that are not spoken or written, and it&#039;s wonderful to see the sparks fly.<br />
<br />
Art (8):<br />
<br />
The unique style found within the work of original creator Nanashi (774) is well reflected in the anime, and this is very pleasing. Put simply, Nanashi has a special way of making smug anime girls, and that alone is a large part of the visual attraction. Overall, compared to other romantic comedies, the art has surpassed my original expectations and has a great degree of character for certain.<br />
<br />
Sound (9):<br />
<br />
Oh don&#039;t even get me started.<br />
Whoever designed the soundtrack for the series knew exactly how to cultivate the very specific feeling for the environments and events that take place. The opening theme alone reflects the teasing and aggressively one-sided nature of the relationship, while also creating an undertone of young love. The ED and episode preview track are also great! The VA&#039;s knocked the representations and personalities of the characters out of the park, especially Nagatoro&#039;s VA. She performs the character far too well, and I can&#039;t imagine that anyone else could pull it off better.<br />
<br />
Characters (9):<br />
<br />
The characters are simply great. They fit the overall tropes but are not entirely unrealistic. Senpai isn&#039;t a single-shade protagonist, which makes him feel more &#039;real&#039; and relatable. It would be easy to imagine Senpai as an actual person; he isn&#039;t locked into a single state of being/restrictions, nor are any of the other characters. They sometimes do things that you might not otherwise expect from their archetype. Nagatoro is more complex than I was expecting, and it&#039;s hard to say more without spoiling anything.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (9):<br />
<br />
Always a highlight of my week, which is a sign that the series resonates and is by my personal standards &#039;good&#039;. I always want to see what happens between the characters, as well as the progression of the story. I don&#039;t always expect that desire with a romcom!<br />
<br />
Overall (9):<br />
<br />
In conclusion, whether by conscious effort or chance, Ijaranaide, Nagatoro-san is the result of a careful and finely tuned production. It&#039;s a romantic comedy with a niche twist represented perfectly in story, sound and animation. It&#039;s awkward and idealistic high-school love at some of it&#039;s finest, filled with all of the unique only-in-anime events and tropes that one might expect, and it&#039;s all unexpectedly heartwarming.<br />
<br />
As a final note - I felt very differently about this series at first as I thought of it as practically fetish material with soft romcom undertones and glorification of abuse, but my feelings on it changed as I continued watching. I was caught off-guard, and I am glad I decided to hang tight. Finally, my evaluation of the series is wholly independent from the previous works of the author, which is a whole different story.<br />
<br />

    It&#039;s not meant to be that deep, it&#039;s a show about a cute ani-girl teasing her senpai.<br />
How much more basic could it get? <br />
To anyone reading I beg you to watch it at least once to have your own opinion of it cause I absolutely love it!<br />
<br />
Story 7/10:<br />
Not anything special I&#039;ve already summed it up quite well:<br />
ani-girl teases ani-boy. Nothing new nor special, but the story isn&#039;t why you are here. You&#039;re here to see senpai get the shit teased out of him and  to see Nagatoro&#039;s smug-hegao every time she teases him; at least I know I am<br />
<br />
Art 8.5/10:<br />
Not much to say it&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396585">
        pretty great and colourful<br />
And the animation is great as well<br />
Though I must say the facial expressions really sell it, Senpai&#039;s &quot;bitch-baby-no-please-face&quot; and Nagatoro&#039;s &quot;What&#039;re gonna to cry&quot; face are my personal favourites.<br />
<br />
Sound 9/10:<br />
The OP&#039;s a bop and though I&#039;m not too into the ED it&#039;s ok enough.<br />
More than that the voice-acting really sells it. Nagatoro&#039;s VA really brings out her character. She sounds like a smug little shit and I absolutely love it. Senpai&#039;s VA is also pretty good. He manages to bring out the Absolute beta bitch energy that senpai emanates<br />
Characters 8/10:<br />
Though they&#039;re pretty run of the mill in this kind of anime, I do quite like (dare I say love?) the characters. Especially Nagatoro, every time she&#039;s on screen I can&#039;t help but grin<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10:<br />
I don&#039;t know why but I absolutely love this show. It&#039;s the highlight if my week actually. This might say more about me than the show but, whenever I see Nagatoro teasing the crap out of senpai my dopamine levels fucking explode. Maybe I&#039;m a weirdo, but I think this show is the best I&#039;ve seen this season<br />
<br />
Overall 9/10:<br />
Great show.
