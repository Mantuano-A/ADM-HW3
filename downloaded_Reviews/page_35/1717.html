    I don&#039;t see any reviews here so I&#039;ll make one. This is my first, so please excuse any mistakes. This is a long review, so please bear with me.<br />
<br />
First of all, the animation is so outstanding. It&#039;s really high quality and during certain scenes in the movie you may think that it&#039;s real life scenery instead of 2D/CG. I couldn&#039;t believe my eyes watching it, &#039;cause usually Yu-Gi-Oh! didn&#039;t have that high quality animation (except for Zexal). Even Arc-V has meh animation. The animation is so constantly beautiful you can&#039;t take your eyes off the screen. This, I think, is one of the gems in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review234668">
        this movie. Oh, and the characters&#039; faces look beautiful all the time you may turn homo (jk). Kaiba looks like Light Yagami but with a gravity defying jacket.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s talk about sound next. There&#039;s not much to say here. The movie uses a few of the soundtracks in the original Duel Monsters series like Passionate Duelist and Wrath of God but with different arrangements of course. The nostalgia is so real when you hear them playing. Most of the soundtracks sound orchestral and it&#039;s awesome but I give an 8/10.<br />
<br />
The original Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel  Monsters didn&#039;t do a good job with characters. Everyone but Yugi, Jounouchi (Joey) and Kaiba were cheerleaders. Anzu and Honda remain useless even in the movie, and Jounouchi is too. Jounouchi has no real purpose in the movie but they give him more screentime than Yugi. He and Honda only serve as comic relief characters.<br />
<br />
The original characters aren&#039;t developed well in the movie, except for Yugi, Kaiba and Bakura. Yup, Bakura. Bakura has an importance in the movie that connects to Aigami&#039;s backstory and that is a job well done. I really like what they retconned to the story, it gives more depth to both Bakura and Aigami.<br />
<br />
Kaiba had always been an asshole with a surprisingly good side. At first you&#039;d think Kaiba is the protagonist for this movie, but then you&#039;d think he&#039;s actually the villain. Kaiba&#039;s character is complex yet simple, for he only wants to defeat Atem but he&#039;d do anything for it. I can&#039;t say much about him, but he&#039;s my second favorite character in the movie even though I hated him in the original series. His character in the movie is very well written.<br />
<br />
Yugi is supposed to be the protagonist? I think he has less screen time than Aigami or even Jounouchi. Yugi has grown, sure. But his character is still shallow. It&#039;d be great if the movie goes deep into his character of a loser who gained strength or focusing on his growth, but even in this movie, he doesn&#039;t feel like the protagonist to me. I still can&#039;t like his character.<br />
<br />
The mysterious beutiful kid Aigami is the best character ever made in the entire Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise imo. His character is so well written and lovable, he should be considered as the real protagonist for this movie. His motivation and backstory is deep, not what you&#039;d expect from a yugioh (especially the original yugioh). The depth of his character really surprised me.<br />
<br />
As for the story, it&#039;s really unlike what you&#039;d expect from a yugioh. 5D&#039;s had a great plot, Zexal II&#039;s and Arc-V&#039;s were good too. But the original? Not really. DM had a shallow plot. But they expanded it in the movie. The movie answers a few questions people may have for DM, regarding Shadi. Aigami has a bitter backstory, and the plot revolves pretty much around him. The plot for me, is the best thing in the movie. It really surprised me for being deep.<br />
<br />
In terms of enjoyment, I give it 9/10. At first I was like &quot;the hell is going on? I don&#039;t get it&quot; and there are scenes that feel kinda out of place, but that still didn&#039;t stop me from enjoying it. It&#039;s not yugioh without children&#039;s card games, so of course there are duels in the movie. The movie is 2 hrs 10 mins long and it has a lot of story to tell but they still included a few duels in it. So the duels feel kinda rushed, and I couldn&#039;t really pay attention to them &#039;cause they were so fast-paced. It&#039;s not like Bonds Beyond Time where they explain every card effect and stuff or whatever move they make. In my personal opinion, they should have made only one duel towards the end of the movie  so that more time can be used for the story. The movie has a few pacing issues, but that still won&#039;t kill the awesomeness.<br />
<br />
The best anime movie I&#039;ve watched thus far was Gintama but this just surpassed it. I don&#039;t judge based on bias just because yugioh is my favorite anime. Heck, Gintama is my least favorite anime but the movie was so great I rated it as the best. The Dark Side of Dimensions however, is a real masterpiece, especially for a yugioh anime. I think it&#039;s appropriate to give the movie 9/10.

    To put this simply - This film is not for people that play the game, because you won&#039;t be finding much of that here. Instead this is a film of pure nostalgia and progression.<br />
<br />
The story is nothing much to speak of, a slotted in bad guy with the wrong intentions and then another &quot;bigger&quot; villain. The heroes then all come together to save the day. But like I said, this film is about character and that&#039;s where it shines - Because this film is for Kaiba.<br />
<br />
They knew perfectly what people love about Kaiba, his sass and utter fire that he talks. His personality is better

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239896">
        than it&#039;s ever been, it was all tuned up to 11 for this film as Kaiba does everything WAY over the top, and it&#039;s beautiful. <br />
<br />
<br />
((( WARNING FOR SPOILERS AHEAD)))<br />
<br />
<br />
But Kaiba&#039;s comedic ways aren&#039;t the only thing shown from him, we get to his his acceptance of the past. He refers to Yugi as Yugi and Atem as, Pharaoh. Kaiba isn&#039;t in denial anymore and we get to see this, but what&#039;s more is that we see him missing his greatest rival. His passion to defeat his rival is so great that he invents the worlds most advanced holographic systems and then even later on, breaks the barrier between dimensions. <br />
Kaiba is having a struggle, because while everyone else accepts their loss, Kaiba for once is the one character that has completely refused to give up on someone. <br />
He is the driving force for this movie, he sets up all of the plot and shows he&#039;s more than capable of crushing anyone in his path even if they possess magic. <br />
<br />
On the other end we have Yugi. Having parted with the Pharaoh and grown up a bit, he feels as if a bit of him is missing but has chosen to move on. There&#039;s really not much else to say for this, Yugi is simply here within this film. He&#039;s here for Atem to have a single second of spotlight. <br />
Speaking of which, Atem does show up and in the most glorious of fashions. A golden light suiting of his majesty, a draw of a single card that allows him to win, to prove his might. It was something that got the cinema cheering in a situation that should be silent. <br />
Buuuut then everyone&#039;s spirits were crushed because in the three instances Atem has, he says NOTHING. I&#039;m not sure what they were thinking with all this because it pissed a lot of people off, there wasn&#039;t a single &quot;It&#039;s time do duel&quot; or &quot;You&#039;ve grown&quot; Or ANYTHING - But anyway.<br />
<br />
Visually the film is stunning, probably the best YuGiOh has ever looked, they perfectly evolved the style whilst keeping it nostalgic. And the masterful use of CG models (Which doesn&#039;t have a frame lock) were perfect for a lot of the mechanical designs. <br />
<br />
Duels are swift and don&#039;t give the intense nature or dramatic effect of the series duels, or Pyramid of Light. Because this isn&#039;t a dueling film, this is a presentation of character - And as I said before Kaiba is that driving force. So if you&#039;re wanting a nostalgic duel, you&#039;ll get the monsters, but not the feeling tactics or display. Because most of the film is taken up by showing where the characters are now and what they&#039;re up to. (But mostly Kaiba)<br />
<br />
For villains and side characters it can literally be summed up with.<br />
(( Friendship powers go - Random bad guy that comes out of nowhere, and is completely slotted in - Sad backstory for those villainous agenda&#039;s - loads of cliche crap ))<br />
But Téa&#039;s new design is hot asf.<br />
<br />
Overall I came out of this very upset with the ending, villains, plot, even some of the new monsters (Mainly those damn cubic things). But there are some characters in this film, that simply carry it all and put a smile on your face.<br />
<br />
Also it&#039;s nice to see Takahiro Kagami&#039;s name as character designer, he was the best animator on the original series and his style has become a staple for YuGiOh to this very day.

    The film sequel no one asked for but delivered on every single level. Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions does something I&#039;ve rarely seen in anime: it caps off a 20 year old franchise with a movie that fits perfectly in the original series canon. It was announced out of the blue with characters from the original series that haven&#039;t been on a television screen in over a dozen years, yet never seems out-of-date or as just a simple cash-grab.<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
<br />
The setting takes place one year after the Ceremonial Duel that sent the Pharaoh spirit within the Millennium Puzzle to the afterlife. Yugi, Tea (Anzu),

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321774">
        Joey (Junouchi), Tristan (Honda), and Bakura are all ready to finish off high school and become something in the world. But before that, they&#039;re met with an unprecedented foe with the power to erase both people&#039;s memories and the physical world as we know it. All the while Seto Kaiba has gone out and put the Millennium Puzzle back together in order to finally get his rematch with the Pharaoh. Both these plot lines meet and the end results have twists and turns that anyone can enjoy!<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
<br />
I&#039;d give this score a 15/10 if I could. The visuals and animation throughout the entirety of this movie are such eye-candy and an absolute treat. Updated character models of both people and duel monsters are a feast for the eyes, especially during duel action sequences. The combination of regular 2D animation and CG animation for the monsters don&#039;t hamper the viewing experience  in any way, but instead give it a sense of wonder and awe.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
<br />
The voice acting, oh how I&#039;ve missed the voices of these characters. Every original series voice actor is back to give life to their characters from the Duel Monsters series. I watched this in English, so to hear Dan Green and Eric Stuart return as Yugi and Kaiba respectively is an absolute nostalgia bomb. The sound effects for the duel sequences are top notch and the music is superb, blending a mix of orchestral tunes with the music from the original series that I never knew I needed.<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
<br />
Everyone is back and it feels so good to see them grown up a bit. Yugi has matured from a timid child to a competent and mature gentleman. Joey is still a goofball. Tristan has become a more dependable young man around his friends. Tea is more outgoing and is ready to study abroad to become the dancer she always wanted to be. Kaiba is as awesome and egotistical as ever (and it&#039;s amazing). Bakura is shy and heartwarming (especially without the Millennium Ring around his neck). Characters from the TV show such as Mai Valentine or Rebecca Hawkins don&#039;t make an appearance, but instead are replaced with the villain and his compatriots that have quite a bit of depth and a surprising connection to the original series.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
<br />
Maybe is just nostalgic value, but I enjoyed every moment of this film, especially the final act and the closing minutes. The animation, the music, the characters, it was all a treat that I personally missed seeing on my screen. So much so that I was never bored at all during all 2 hours of this movie. Grab a seat and grab your favorite Yu-Gi-Oh! cards because it&#039;s time to duel!<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
<br />
You almost never come across a sequel movie that caps off a series as good as this one does, especially one that comes out 12 years after the original series ends. This is one of those rare occasions that does so with interest. If you&#039;re a fan of the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise in any way, this is a must-see. Though, it might be best if you watched Seasons 1, 2, latter half of 3, and 5 of Duel Monsters before watching this.

    To preface this &quot;review&quot; some pointers:<br />
<br />
- There will be SPOILERS. If you haven&#039;t seen the movie yet, don&#039;t read this review if you don&#039;t want to be spoiled. Definitely do come back after to share your opinions. I would love to hear what you guys thought of the movie. Am I in the minority? <br />
- I am perfectly fine with nostalgia bait. The problem is when producers think that a show can succeed based on nostalgia alone. <br />
- I am aware that this is a sequel to the manga and not the anime, accounting for some of the discrepancies. Yet, some of the characters actions

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265201">
        were just bizarre, in my opinion.<br />
- Finally, please do not let my opinion of the film ruin your experience with it. This is my personal opinion and my opinion alone.<br />
<br />
Alright... Here we go. I do apologize for the stream-of-consciousness ranting. It&#039;s like my mind is actively trying to erase the movie from my memories.<br />
<br />
First off, it started off well enough, with the reintroduction of the characters and what they were up to after all the time. I particularly liked how they framed the story with Anzu&#039;s dream of going to New York. However, that&#039;s when things started to go South.<br />
<br />
Essentially, to sum all of the problems up into one word, it was contrived... and rushed. Sorry, that was two words. In my opinion, everything that happened in this movie happened because they needed it to happen. They needed new monsters - insert a hundred different variations of the Blue-Eyes White Dragon that had no build-up, reason for existing or proper differentiation (more on this later). They needed a new enemy that had to be related to the cast somehow to make him relevant - shoehorn in some subplot was never hinted at or talked about in the original series so it felt like it came out of nowhere. They needed Atem to appear again and appear he did EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN&#039;T EVEN MAKE ANY SENSE!<br />
<br />
Urgh... the plot. Don&#039;t even get me started. I&#039;ve already talked about the shoehorned-in villain, but boy does it get better. The plot was unnecessarily convoluted and yet still managed to be contrived and seem like it came out of nowhere. What in the world was with this collective consciousness nonsense? Why is it important and how does it relate to anything? Why was Kaiba&#039;s Duel Disk perfectly equipped to combat his powers? Seriously, it could have been anything else and have been much better explained and understandable. How could Kaiba pull out a God Card from the ground and play it with his virtual system?<br />
<br />
Speaking of Kaiba, that subplot with his obsession was really at odds with Aigami&#039;s plot. There was hardly any correlation. Not to mention, sure he was obsessed with Yugi, but they really pushed his obsession a little too far in this one. Though, I have to admit, that would have been a compelling enough story in and of itself if they had taken their time to expand on it. At the end of the movie, people were actually LAUGHING at his hyperbolic obsession with Atem. Going back in time to duel Atem? Yeah, that&#039;s not obsessive at all. Seriously, Javert he is not. Also, Kaiba removing the Millennium Puzzle from the crypt and actually solving it with technology was kinda cool, but it completely ruined the mystique of the items. Wouldn&#039;t it have been even cooler if his high-tech machines failed to solve the puzzle?<br />
<br />
That climax... Oh God. Remember how I was talking about them introducing new monsters for the sake of it? Well, screw duel tactics and anything of the sort, the ending was just a monster spam that got boring after the 100th &quot;HERE&#039;S A MORE POWERFUL MONSTER THAN YOURS&quot;. Seriously, if I have to sit though another Cubic monster and Blue-Eyes iteration that has zero differentiation from one another... This was obviously because they were rushed for time. They had a quota of monsters to push and there was no way they could dedicate 30 minutes to build up a single monster.<br />
<br />
Also, the GOD DAMN CG. Why are some monsters like the Black Magician and the Black Magician Girl in normal 2D, simulated-cel animation while many of the other monsters were rendered in 3DCG? Seriously, STICK TO ONE. It&#039;s horrendous enough that they used CG, but if they had made ALL the monsters CG, there would have been at least a point! You know, creating a disconnect between the real and the virtual? But no, we can&#039;t have our Black Magician Girl be polygons, can we?<br />
<br />
This is a perfect example of an unnecessary sequel that was made for the sake of being made. Regardless of what the creator said, I felt zero passion from this project and everything was paint-by-numbers and forced. For a fan, I really don&#039;t think I would have missed out if I hadn&#039;t seen it. Personally speaking, the ONLY good thing that came out of this was seeing Anzu actually fulfilling her dream. Anzu is adorable. Oh, and the bonus card and goodybag as well. That was pretty good.<br />
<br />
Maybe I&#039;m exaggerating. Maybe I just need to calm down and watch it again. And watch it again I will, because as a Yu-Gi-Oh! fan, I&#039;m willing to give it another chance. But at this moment, while I&#039;m a Yu-Gi-Oh! fan, I am not a fan of this movie.

    IF YOU SKIP EVERY SCENE THAT HAS DIVA and you stop watching immediately after Kaiba and real yugi&#039;s duel THEN you have a great movie that gives the manga a bit of a better closure. <br />
<br />
I felt the manga&#039;s ending is a little abrupt, as it gives no context to what Yugi is doing after Atem moves on, so the main character doesn&#039;t have a conclusion to his journey. If you agree this movie does give you the nice feeling of seeing what&#039;s up with Yugi and the gang. All the duels in this movie are good and are worth a watch except for the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361540">
        last one. But the movie contradicts many of the manga&#039;s plot points, reverses Kaiba&#039;s character arc, and is generally boring and stupid. From this point forward I will spoil the movie.<br />
<br />
If the whole point of the movie is that Atem moved on, and is not inside the millenium puzzle, and now we watch as Yugi moves on, then why would he appear? That means he still is here. When real Yugi defeats Kaiba in the end he tells him Atem will not come back and that it&#039;s time to move forward instead of to dwell on the past which is echoing Kaiba&#039;s sentiment from battle city. That is the true movie&#039;s ending as far as I&#039;m concerned, because that&#039;s a powerful moment if you followed the plot. Got to give credit where credit is due, it is an interesting idea that Kaiba is actually obssessed with fighting Atem and losing to real Yugi he realizes that he is wrong in his pursuits. Yugi wanting to become a game designer and make a new game fits very well and is a good ending to his character. And the animation of the duels is great. <br />
<br />
IF YOU DECIDE TO WATCH THIS MOVIE I recommend skipping every scene that Diva/Aigami show up in. He is not interesting, his motive is forced, his development is uninteresting, and the writers try to get easy sympathy point by recycling Malik/Isis plot points. And also, when Yugi and Kaiba&#039;s duel ends with Aigami interrupting them immediately skip to the credits scene. Do not waste your time on anything else.

    Yugioh is one of the first anime which me and a lot of people had watched in their life and especialy for me Yugioh is a very big [if not the biggest part] of my childhood.But enough I talked for myself let&#039;s start the review probably spoilers. PLOT the plot takes place after the end of the original series and to be more specific after the final duel between Yugi and Pharaoh . Kaiba wants to find the millenium puzzle in order to bring back Pharaoh in order to beat him and become again the king of games but he haves two obstacles on his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review341373">
        way the one is Yugi and the other is Aigami a mysterious person who in order to accomplish his ambisions he will do everything to stop the return of pharaoh. First I have to recomend you to see the final four episodes of the anime in order to have more informations about some things in the movie .As a big fun of the franchise and with original season being mychildhood I was really hyped about this movie and my hype didn&#039;t dissapoint me. While I was watching the movie I expected good things and what I took was probably one of the best things yugioh frinchise gave us. The movie doesn&#039;t focus only to show us new cards but it show us something more it shows us a well written story who even though it&#039;s based to a really sucsessful franchise it does its own thing without trying to count on nostalgia . Furthere we can&#039;t talk about yugioh without talking about the duels and even though the duels are few and they have quick progress but they aren&#039;t just duels with cards they are duels of of ideals even though only three characters dueling each one haves each own purpose and ideology which he representse with his actions in the movie. ALSO the messeges which this movie wants to give to its viewer the first is what revenge isn&#039;t a solution and it&#039;s only brings more destruction the second and most important is something that is exactly the oposite of what the original series focused and that&#039;s the look at the past. The movie shows us that the most important is the future and we should focus on this instead of trying to seek an answer to the past but I will talk more about this to the character part. The only nagative is that some duels were extremly quickly and it wasn&#039;t easy to understand what the effects of some cards were but it wasn&#039;t a really problem. So a story which isn&#039;t trying to take advance of the source meterial sucess and not a high budget advertisement for cards but the end of a story  which a lot of people loved during childhood and leaves you with a satysfying feeling 8. ART the animation is spectacular .Yes obviously it&#039;s a movie with bigger budget than the series but in this movie put a huge effort and create something beutiful. The artstyle of Kazuki takahashi is unique and detailed  but gallop took an animation from a different age and turn it to something awsome just think the artstyle of the original series but with an animation like fate/heavens feel [yes I said it].Also a lot of monsters are cg but they are really welldesigned and not something that was used from the studio to save money so unexpecably good animation 9.SOUND I will start from   the music and with the soundtracks to you who are fans of the original series this soundtracks are the same from the original series and nostalgia waves. The voice actors and oh boy the voice actors there is a proof why a voice actor is also the same as an actor in a movie . The voices of the voice actors here represents perfect the feelings of the character they cover you can feel what a character feels when he talks that&#039;s a great achievement and it really reveals the talent of this people 9. CHARACTERS and now we are getting to the great part . At the start of the movie we see yugi and his friends talking about their dreams and what they want to do after they graduate that shows how they have grown up but lets talk about the protagonist of the movie and I mean Kaiba. Iam not jocking Kaiba is the real protagonist of this movie but he is different from what you saw in the series .Kaiba here is focussed on the past he wants to bring back pharaoh in order to challenge him a last time but he isn&#039;t obsessive he wants to see one more time his rival in order to setle the things between them but more about this later .Yugi from the other hand he is focuss on the future and while he still remembers about the pharaoh he doesn&#039;t let the past to prevent him from going forward.And now we will talk about Aigami or my favourite yugioh villain why because he don&#039;t wants to qonquere the world like marik but he wants to avege  his teacher&#039;s death but there is more Aigami wants to create a new world without violence where only chosen people like him will live there but while the movie continiues Aigami starts to have second thoughts about his plan especialy after he meets the person who is resposible for his teacher&#039;s death he starts to ask himself if all this he does is really the best thing to do.And now let&#039;s talk about the relationships of these characters like I said above their duels are also a fight of ideals . During their duels we are watching what characters believe especialy the duel between Yugi and kaiba it shows how to create a good relationship between two rivals and there their beliefes are reversed with kaiba focussing on the past and the only think he wants is to duel pharaoh while Yugi now cares about the future and try to saw kaiba the truth also the duel between Yugi and Aigami we are watching the cosmoteory of Aigami and Yugi during the duel yugi option starts to affects Aigami to the point that Aigami starts to thinks more about the reasons he fights . The end of the movie showing us how our characters have change with the most important scences where Aigami remembers what his teacher tought him about revenge and violence and how Kaiba accepts  Yugi  as an admirable duelist while for the biggest part of the movie Kaiba face yugi as a vessel later he shows his respect not only as a duelist but as aperson and to conclude the characters are the main reason which makes this movie good 9. As you understand I really enjoyied this movie,.This movie is an important part of the Yugioh franchise it&#039;s the finale of something which is a big part not only of mine childhood but million people who when were younger they would wake at 7 oclock the morning to watch the series and giving them happy memories both from the anime and cardgame and last but not least I want to give props to gallop because they didn&#039;t did a sequel in order to make money but they show their respect to the fans and to the creator of the series and that&#039;s how a studio should watch his fans not as ATM but as people who love their works overall 9/10

    Now, I didn&#039;t particularly care for the Yugioh anime. I would have liked it better if it stick closer to the manga, but The Dark Side of Dimensions is perfect. I think this is one if the best ideas for a movie ever. It&#039;s a sequel to the original manga ending, not the anime. If you watch the dub, they change a lot to fit the crappy 4kids dub, so I recommend the sub.<br />
<br />
The story is great. It works as an amazing sequel. It takes place in the future where the characters are graduating from high school and have to think about their future. But,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review335247">
        Kaiba is back and is trying to bring back the Millennium Puzzle. A mysterious man steals pieces if the puzzle and, without spoilers, seems to have so powers.<br />
<br />
If you see anything from this movie, the first thing you&#039;re going to notice is that the artwork and animation is perfect. It updates the original art while keeping true to the character designs. The cgi for the card duels also looks great. When a monster needs to look small, it looks small. When it needs to look huge, which happens a lot, it looks huge. From the way they&#039;re animated to the way they&#039;re drawn, they look perfect. I normally don&#039;t focus on visuals in these reviews, but when it&#039;s an important part of the experience, I need to bring it up.<br />
<br />
The characters, of course, are just as excellent as always. I swear Kazuki Takahasi had something to do with the script because the writing is just like the manga. No, it&#039;s just like a movie sequel to a manga should be.<br />
<br />
This movie is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. It completely pulls off its massive ambition and gets every thing right. I was hooked the whole time. It even adds a lot to the original story which is something sequels like this don&#039;t usually do. Really, I don&#039;t think there are any sequels like this, but I wish there could be more great ideas like this one.

    It&#039;s been a really long time since I&#039;ve written a review but I haven&#039;t been able to stop thinking about this film since I saw it and so I&#039;m going to jot my thoughts down here :) <br />
<br />
Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions is the perfect sequel to an already perfect ending. If you&#039;re like me, you were probably worried that this film would undo the great and satisfying ending of Yu-Gi-Oh: Duel Monsters, however I&#039;m pleased to say quite the opposite is true. The film treats itself as an epilogue right from the start as we get to see our heroes 6 months after

          <span style="display: none;" id="review303976">
        the events of Duel Monsters. The characters we&#039;ve grown to love have started to grow up and are thinking about their futures.<br />
<br />
Yugi has still retained the lesson he learned but of course he misses Atem the pharaoh, his dear friend. Meanwhile Seto Kaiba has a score to settle and won&#039;t take the afterlife as no for an answer. By the way, Seto Kaiba is by far the best part of this film. He&#039;s badass, he&#039;s got the coolest gadgets, the best lines and the coolest monsters. But does Atem make an appearance in this film? Well, I&#039;ll leave that open ;)<br />
<br />
The story isn&#039;t really anything original but it keeps the magic of the original series very much alive whilst also progressing a plotline that is both exciting characterwise and rich in lore for the egyptian whacky stuff.<br />
<br />
The Yu-Gi-Oh franchise has never looked better. The animation is crisp, the CGI is well integrated and the sound design is perfect. Solid 10 in this category.<br />
<br />
Honestly my only gripe is the duels themselves. Because the plot has so much content and we want to see a lot of duels, they have been dumbed down to season 1 levels of ridiculousness. They&#039;re very pretty to look at, but a lot of the time you will be thinking &quot;That card is BS!&quot; or &quot;How the hell did you do that?!&quot; If you&#039;re into the actual card game, this will most likely bug you to no end.<br />
<br />
Overall this film satisfied my childhood on a level I didn&#039;t even know I&#039;ve wanted. This movie didn&#039;t just satisfy the fan inside me. It made me as a person happy :)<br />
<br />
So for that it gets a solid 9/10<br />
<br />

    Overall this is just another Yu-Gi-Oh! Movie. I came into this movie thinking it was going to be really good, but the dimensional summoning that was introduced really turned me off. I felt like it wasn&#039;t really explained that well and it was really confusing at times at what was going to happen when a monster attacked or a card was activated. For most of the duels involving Aigami was really confusing when he was fusing his monsters and attacking multiple times on one duel. They made the main antagonist really overpowered and Konami had to dig themselves out their own hole. This ended up

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239998">
        some really stupid card combos to defeat him. <br />
<br />
TL;DR: Movie was ok, some stupid card combos, don&#039;t go into it expecting a lot

    This film is a treat for fans of the original Yu-Gi-Oh!, but will likely have limited appeal to others.<br />
<br />
While any attempts to play the game itself quickly devolve from pseudo-strategy to enough shouting to do the cast of Dragonball Z proud, they look as gorgeous and classy as the rest of the movie. On the audio side of things too, things are good, and there are a lot of classic Yu-Gi-Oh! tunes to be heard by nimble-eared fans.<br />
Seeing the characters back in action again is delightful, even if many serve little purpose in the plot itself. Kaiba, especially, is a riot in the film, playing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review240242">
        up his Kaiba-ness to the degree that one might just think they&#039;ve stumbled upon something written by LittleKuriboh.<br />
The plot is solid, and ties into the lore of the franchise well enough. Character motivations aren&#039;t exactly complicated, but there are enough conflicting forces to keep things somewhat unpredictable, and the sleak pacing won&#039;t let you get too comfortable once things get moving. You&#039;ll either love or hate the resolution for doing or not doing what you thought it was going to do.<br />
<br />
Ultimately little more than a fun romp in a beloved franchise, but a very well excecuted one.

    . The animation was flawless, if you like anime and great graphics this film really is for you. <br />
The character development was also worth mentioning, especially with the antagonist, I felt as if they really built up a good background for this character and usually this is a rare thing to find. They tied up a lot of loose ends too, mainly concerning Bakura and even Shadi, so this was very satisfying to me after the original series had left a lot of questions. <br />
The humour was well placed and not too overbearing, Kaiba had the most laughter inducing comments though with Joey a close

        second. Triston, Duke and Tea (although seen) did not play huge roles but that was expected. I was however, very pleased with the amount of screen time for Bakura- in the original series his character was usually very overshadowed. Yugi really proved how strong he has become as an individual in this film, it was marvellous to see this development. <br />
My only criticism would be the clarity of death within the film. People were disappearing left, right and centre only to appear later completely fine. I couldn’t tell what was going on in that regard to be honest.<br />

    I&#039;m writing my review a little later than some, but hopefully its useful to potential viewers. <br />
<br />
When Dark Side of Dimensions was announced in 2016, many people were very excited at the prospect of another Yu-Gi-Oh movie and some were little apprehensive as the franchise&#039;s movies tend to be a little underwhelming and even cringey. Dark Side of Dimensions is a step-up from that, but it&#039;s not perfect.<br />
<br />
Story: The story is pretty basic and uniform for Yu-Gi-Oh. Good guys are having a good time, bad guys show up and it&#039;s up to the good guys to stop them, oh and Seto Kaiba has his own

          <span style="display: none;" id="review252813">
        motives as usual. It&#039;s not a bad story, but for how much this movie was hyped up, I was personally expecting something a little bigger and bolder. The plot is a little similar to Bonds Beyond Time in my opinion, but it&#039;s not awful. Western viewers will also be surprised that the English dub is entirely uncensored and there&#039;s actual guns. I honestly think the story could have done with more than just the good vs evil trope, but it definitely wasn&#039;t as bad as i thought it could have been.<br />
<br />
Art: The animation is fantastic and a real step up from the original series. No more pointy chins! The art flows smoothly and definitely shows how much animation has come from the early 2000&#039;s. It&#039;s bright, has depth and looks amazing both on laptop and television screen. <br />
<br />
Sound: Again, the sound is fantastic. It&#039;s clear, crisp and the voice acting for both sub and dub is great. The original voice actors are welcomed back and reprise their roles and it&#039;s wonderful to see how much the dub voice actors have improved in particular. As in Bonds Beyond Time, the late Maddie Blaustein&#039;s role of Sugoroku Mutou is given to Wayne Grayson who does a very good match of Maddie&#039;s voice. The dub has a few corny jokes as usual, but it&#039;s very faithful to the sub. The original soundtracks from both the sub and dub also play through the movie, but sadly the Western release is mostly stuck with the 4kids music. <br />
<br />
Character: All the original characters return for this movie, bar a few. The movie tends to focus on Seto Kaiba more, where we see huge character development - something which is very overdue. Like the original release, the characters boast the same personalities we knew and loved and it&#039;s a nice slice of nostalgia. There&#039;s also new characters introduced and we get to see the backstorys of a number of characters. I do feel that some characters were left out of the story as usual (notably Otogi/Duke, Honda.Tristan, Anzu/Tea and Ryo Bakura) and that some characters needed more character development, but as per the series the movie focuses more on the main character. I also feel that the main villain of the movie was also quite generic and there wasn&#039;t a lot of character development.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: If you watched the original series or read the manga, you will enjoy this movie. I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s fantastic but it&#039;s definitely better than the other movies. it&#039;s great for nostalgia and you may even find yourself watching to fetch out your old Yu-Gi-Oh cards.<br />
<br />
Overall: Overall, I give Dark Side of Dimensions a 7/10. The animation, sound and characters are great but I felt that the generic plot let it down a little. However, it was still a huge improvement on the past movies (Yu-Gi-Oh 1999, Pyramid of Light and Bonds Beyond Time) and I do feel that it&#039;s a good adaption. With a little more story, less generic good vs evil and more character development this could have been a great movie.

    Before starting this review, I must first say I&#039;m not being able to judge this movie properly. But I don&#039;t think it can be judged as any other movie, because it&#039;s, just like Digimon Tri, a movie about nostalgia, unable to be understood by people who didn&#039;t watch the original TV series. That is why it&#039;s impossible not to compare it with the Duel Monsters TV show. Yes, this might have more to do with the manga than the TV show, but still as an animation it has obvious ties to the old series, also, obviously, an animation.<br />
<br />
With that out of the way, I must

          <span style="display: none;" id="review276300">
        say I was disappointed with this movie. But I&#039;ll start with the good. The characters and their interactions are spot-on, they are the same characters we know from before, and act accordingly. Though they are a little older now and, with the many advancements in storytelling that anime has suffered from then to now, this is definitely better written than the original show. It feels more mature whilst maintaining the original&#039;s edginess, necessary silliness and dark undertones. Another nice thing is the pace of the duels, they are fast and furious, but there&#039;s where we find the first mistake. It&#039;s too fast so they can&#039;t explain exactly what&#039;s happening and the duels use slightly different rules than before. Yes, it&#039;s a movie, so it can&#039;t waste time, but still it is a mistake.<br />
<br />
Okay, now that I have nothing good more to say, to the bad we go. The visuals, although definitely boasting bigger budget than the TV shows, are uglier! They use a lot of extremely ugly and excessive 3D animation for the monsters, and a excessive color filters that leave everything lifeless. I don&#039;t know how could they fail so big. Another misdeed is the story, which, although touching on interesting subject matters, still fails to make sense and is devoid of explanations in all of the key moments. It&#039;s like it wasn&#039;t even meant to make sense, to begin with! Last but not least, Yami Yugi, the main character of the show and the manga, appears only at the last moments of the movie and, after all the hype for his appearance throughout the whole 2-hour duration of the film, he doesn&#039;t even have dialogue! It&#039;s super underwhelming and disappointing.<br />
<br />
For all of this I&#039;d say this movie was a waste of time and is totally unnecessary.

    This would be my first review so forgive me. <br />
<br />
Right, so let&#039;s jump in with the plot. I watched this in the Japanese version. The story itself was not related to any of the current series, but more after the events of the original series. The story itself didn&#039;t make a great deal of sense to me, but I had watched the final part in English also and they seem to be a lot of dialogue change to fit the English story, o it may have a slightly different story depending on the language.<br />
<br />
the animation is amazing, and a mix of 2 and 3d, with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254781">
        a lot of effects used for duels themselves. beautiful.<br />
<br />
The characters are from the original series and set a bit later, IT was great hearing the original characters voices in the English version (I did not watch the show in Japanese and so can&#039;t compare). But Kaiba is the star of the show, Back bigger, badder and with awesome new tech.<br />
<br />
Overall this is a nice watch for fans of the original series definitely. MAybe not the story, but to relive some nostalgia when you see and hear the original cast again. See some awesome animation and slight evolution of even some classic cards and the main characters alike. So if you&#039;re a fan of the old show, give it a go

    I usually don&#039;t write reviews cause I suck but I still wanted to write a review for this movie... <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The plot was absolutely garbage. I gave it a 3 but I feel like that&#039;s still to much. It kinda felt like the same plot from Yu-Gi-Oh: The Movie (which also sucked).<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art was absolutely fantastic. Can&#039;t say anything bad about it to be honest. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
It was such a nice feeling to see all the older characters back. Kaiba is still that douchebag, Joey is still a dork, etc. I feel like they should have used characters like Joey, Tristan and Thea more though. <br />
The villain

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242020">
        on the other hand was horrible :/ <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Sadly, even though the characters were great to see again, it didn&#039;t make me enjoy the movie more. <br />
<br />
So overall, I give it a 5. So I guess it&#039;s not THAT bad, I guess I just expected more. From the three movies Yu-Gi-Oh has, it still only has one good movie so far. Maybe when they wanna make movies, they should focus on new characters instead of characters from the series?

    Despite the convoluted plot, a poorly written antagonist, and nonsensical duels, I&#039;d say the ending is worth watching the movie for. Unlike the original TV series, the Pyramid of Light movie, and the numerous Yugioh incarnations since then, this movie feels like one of the most in-depth character pieces I&#039;ve seen from the franchise, and that was honestly shocking. I appreciate how the writers gave serious thought to providing closure for all the characters, but I was disappointed in how the story got bogged down by the need for spectacle, a villain, and an evil plot. <br />
<br />
As many others have stated, Kaiba is the star

          <span style="display: none;" id="review240533">
        of the movie and is indeed fleshed out very well, but I&#039;m not sure if everyone will truly appreciate the amount of development he gets in this movie. Serving as a somewhat &quot;coming-of-age&quot; finale for the characters, we discover at the beginning of the movie that Yugi and all his friends have moved on with their lives since the days of Atem and Battle City, and that they all have plans for the near future. Kaiba, the Pharaoh&#039;s rival and most distant &quot;friend&quot;, is ironically the only one who has not been able to move forward with his life. The development of his Solid Vision duel disk and his tireless effort to reassemble the millennium puzzle further evidences his obsession with the Pharaoh. <br />
<br />
*Spoiler*<br />
Kaiba&#039;s acceptance of &quot;magic,&quot; and his desire to resurrect Atem, who he acknowledges as both a rival and finally as a friend, was very touching. For me, the final moments of this movie are even more fitting that those of the TV series because it brings the story full-circle, ending with Kaiba confronting Atem instead of Yugi. For some, this difference might not hold much significance, but if we recall the first major duel in the series, it was Kaiba losing to the Pharaoh, not Yugi. So for me, this effort was the director&#039;s way of telling us that Kaiba and the Pharaoh are the true protagonists of the series, and that their rivalry has been the instrument propelling the story this entire time. <br />
<br />
Story: 4<br />
Art: 10<br />
Sound: 8<br />
Character: 9<br />
Enjoyment: 6<br />
Overall: 6<br />
<br />
Despite the somewhat low grade I&#039;m giving this movie, I would still recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the original series and wants to see some justice done for the characters they have grown up loving as I did. I believe this would have been a MUCH better movie if the villainous subplot and the notion of &quot;Dimension Dueling&quot; were scrapped,but the creators were obviously trying to sell some cards... A much better idea would have been to just use Kaiba&#039;s tournament to give the viewers a chance to see the entire cast back in action, but unfortunately the duels were limited to only Kaiba, Aigami, and Yugi. Since I liked the ending enough, I do consider it canon in my mind, and hopefully others who read this review will as well, given their appreciation for the characters over visual effects and action.

    Holy shit. My expectations must have been really low without my realizing it, because I was really surprised when this movie ended up being really good. Basically, this was everything I could have wanted out of a Yugioh! movie. <br />
<br />
To start, this plot was just so... Kaiba. After everything they went through to get the pharaoh&#039;s soul to rest, Kaiba is going to go to any lengths necessary to resurrect Atem and finally beat him in a duel to prove he&#039;s the best. Which is so over the top and ridiculous... though I can&#039;t say I&#039;m surprised. But we&#039;re given a bit of a twist

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281657">
        with this movie&#039;s villain. At a glance, he seems generic enough. He&#039;s got this vague power to alter reality and is aiming for a world of peace but has been corrupted by his own abilities... nothing we haven&#039;t all seen before. What made this interesting was that this power was conditional. It was granted when Atem&#039;s soul was finally laid to rest and would be taken back if he were ever to return. So for a good chunk of the movie, our villain was fighting to do what&#039;s right while simultaneously trying to destroy the world. <br />
<br />
It was interesting to me. But mostly, I just feel like they went above and beyond what I expected from an anniversary movie. Of course there were the given nostalgia kicks. It was nice to see the old, familiar characters in this shiny new animation. (I was particularly fond of how realistic the cards looked during the duels.) The main characters all got their Moment, when they&#039;re first introduced in the movie and it&#039;s like everything just freezes for a second, allowing the audience to take them in and accept them back into their lives-- presumably after years of separation. (But I like to think I was still open to that feeling, even though I had just finished watching the series in its entirety literally the day before.) But what I really mean is that the movie worked to expand on things that were kind of skipped over in the actual series. <br />
<br />
We finally get a real purpose for Shadi. Yes, it&#039;s a purpose that&#039;s really only relevant in the context of this movie&#039;s plot, but you know what? I&#039;ll take it. In the series, he was this mysterious figure, guiding things from the background. Except Ishizu was basically already doing that. I kept expecting for something more to be revealed about Shadi, for him to play a bigger role. But then his spirit is laid to rest with the pharaoh&#039;s and it&#039;s just left at that.<br />
<br />
But that&#039;s nothing compared to what this movie did for Bakura. I&#039;m glad I watched this so soon afterwards, because I almost left a lengthy rant in my review for the actual series about how Bakura was such a wasted character. At first, I was actually surprised to see him playing any sort of prominent role in this movie. I mean, I know they SAY Bakura was always one of their friends, but it&#039;s definitely not portrayed like that. He&#039;s in their class, but he&#039;s not really part of their little group. And honestly, he&#039;s only ever really important because he happens to be the host body of the final villain. Bakura himself doesn&#039;t do a whole lot. And at the end of it all, it&#039;s not totally clear whether he was even aware he was possessed by an evil spirit all this time. This movie finally gave Bakura a bit of a backstory, the Millennium Ring makes a reappearance, and it&#039;s strongly implied that Bakura IS aware of all he&#039;s done, but for the most part those memories are something he&#039;s purposely repressed. Honestly, Ryo Bakura deserves, like, his own spin-off show, but this was a good start. <br />
<br />
But the most important thing this movie added to the Yugioh! experience was a feeling of closure. So much of the final episodes of the series is spent on the duel that I&#039;m not sure they really got across the point they were trying to make-- that Yugi has grown to be able to stand on his own without Atem. That&#039;s definitely a sense I got here, from start to finish. <br />
<br />
This movie wasn&#039;t just a celebration of what Yugioh! had been. It continued to add to the story, padding the areas where the original series fell short. I wasn&#039;t expecting anything great when I decided to check it out, but I was left with the urge to immediately watch it again once I reached the credits. This movie is definitely worth watching for Yugioh! fans.<br />
<br />
(And I never really got into the Yugioh! shipping game, but I&#039;ll be damned if his obsession with Atem isn&#039;t the Seto Kaiba version of a crush.) <br />

    In this movie you join Yugi and his friends as they try and stop the antagonist Diva from stealing pieces of Pharo&#039;s enchantment item. Seto Kaiba had nearly collected all pieces to summon Pharo for a duel but Yugi and Diva&#039;s sister had the last two pieces, they need to settle the argument with a duel! who will win? I think that this anime was very interesting  but the duels got very repetitive and it was really predictable. The animation was very clean and the sound/voice actors were almost perfect. I would recommend watching the anime before watching the film to understand the backstories
