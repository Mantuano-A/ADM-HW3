    Well, this is my first review, and I don&#039;t think I&#039;m good at writing them, but I&#039;ll give a try.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve scored the three previous season to 7, mainly because it was repetitive, and there was not this thing that embraces your mind and take you to an other world. <br />
And then, I&#039;ve watched this season, the final one. And it is perfect. Louise is becoming more and more mature, even if she keeps her tsundere style which is still funny (although it annoyed me a lot of times, but hey, it&#039;s who she is after all). For Saito, it&#039;s approximatively the same, he&#039;s growing too,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review97149">
        and we really see their relationship evolving...<br />
<br />
About the scenes, there is a lot more romantic scenes than before, which is wonderful because their kind of different from the previous season, there is something that makes you feel good, and you&#039;re happy for them too in some way.<br />
Since I was also obsessed by the magic scenes with void magic and all that, you should know that there&#039;s also a LOT more of these scenes, and I found that they were much more impressive.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m also noticing the OST which is just full of epicness (special note for the song &quot;Passion&quot; which I&#039;m listening right now).<br />
<br />
<br />
I think they did a really good work, this season embraces the whole series, and every episode makes you feel wonderful and the two final episodes are just so much awesome that you can&#039;t accept it is already over, and then you see how it was just a nicely dream in which you will go back someday...<br />

    Zero no Tsukaima F is the final season of the series and it features a young boy Saito getting abused by his master Louise. Stuff happens, Saito is extremely indecisive about his relationship with Louise, stuff gets fixed. Nothing new is really found in this season and I won&#039;t go too much into detail about the summary because hey, you should have seen the previous three seasons before you watch the 4th one, no?<br />
<br />
So about the story.. heh. If you have seen the previous seasons, you&#039;ll have a pretty good idea what happens. Some stuff happens, maybe some random fanservice here and there, filler episodes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review57655">
        randomly thrown in out of nowhere, a problem occurs  and is solved with usually an unrealistic solution that probably has some plot holes. And by plot holes, I don&#039;t mean &quot;look very deep into the anime&quot; ones, I mean &quot;wtf how did they just do that it didn&#039;t make any sense at all&quot; kind of plot holes. It takes the fantasy genre to a whole new level and again, not in a good way (SPOILER example: Saito stealing a fighter jet from a military base in 2 seconds).  Some of it can be attributed to the fact that the majority of the season was rushed but all in all, they really did not need some of the fillers; it was just a waste of time. If you&#039;re one of those people that like to have an intricate plot with plenty of BAM moments, this is not the anime for you. The plot is lackluster and very predictable. The ending was a perfect example of this. Personally, I thought the ending was very predictable but it fits the anime. Having said that though, ZnT is NOT about the story. If you have been watching this for the story, then I got news for you, choose something else to watch. The story here is just there to have at least some &quot;meaning&quot;  between each episode, nothing special.<br />
<br />
Al-right, the characters. The characters are again, nothing special. An abusive tsundere, some boobs, some more boobs, and a loli. This anime throughout the seasons has shown no character development, Louise and Saito were supposedly married at the end of season two but Saito is still an indecisive guy and Louise still blows him up. Usually this would lower the score as dynamic characters are always good but the thing is, it&#039;s what the anime is known for. This is why most people have continued to watch though the seasons. Sure, Saito will piss you off every time he ogles some girls breast because he completely lacks self-control or some other stuff that ticks you off. The non-changing character foils that have been constant throughout all four seasons is the selling point of this anime. You don&#039;t watch this to see some well thought out strategy like Death Note or the plain awesomeness of Steins;Gate, you watch this too see Saito getting blown up by explosions and the tsundere Louise being her usual self and the relationship between them. I will have to say that it will probably get tiring if you watch this in one go.<br />
<br />
The sound doesn&#039;t really do much considering most of the BGM is just reused from the previous seasons. In some cases, it certainly does help set the mood and I loved how they reused one of the openings during one of the final episodes. The energetic OP also adds towards the enjoyment of the anime; it fits the mood. Though the EP isn&#039;t bad, the usage of it is certainly questionable in some cases. Something some by Rie Kugimiya doesn&#039;t really fit certain situations if you know what I mean.<br />
<br />
The art wasn&#039;t really exceptional and doesn&#039;t take away from the anime itself. Not much to comment on this as it doesn&#039;t feature any special art style. The battle scenes were too short in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m a Louise fan so this is probably biased but I really enjoyed the series overall. If I was to use by biased score, this would be a 10/10 just because I&#039;m a huge Louise fan. That&#039;s kind of the thing with this anime, either you&#039;ll hate the characters (I don&#039;t think many people expected much out of the story anyways) or come to love em. The story was really annoying at certain points because of the number of episodes that were just pointless. They could have easily just spent a couple of minutes or not even included certain parts (really didn&#039;t need a episode dedicated towards the crowning of a queen) of the anime. The ending however, was probably the saving grace for this anime. I personally value a conclusive ending opposed to some random harem ending. Overall, I think that this season manages to set up the end of the series only leaving some minor plot holes. Watch this with a grain of salt in mind.<br />
<br />
Feedback is appreciated as this was my first review.

    Four episodes in, and things actually got to a pretty explosive and fantastic start - the first three episodes are devoted entirely to closing up what the third season left hanging, and it does so EXTREMELY well. New characters are introduced, but they don&#039;t take up too much time in favor of action and plot. Those first three episodes on their own could have made the entire season, to the point that if they had been released as an OVA on their own, I wouldn&#039;t have been surprised. <br />
<br />
... And perhaps they should have. With the fourth episode, we&#039;re treated to the typical cliches and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review52939">
        gags, with Louise wanting Saito on her own time but being her nasty, violent excuse for &quot;tsun&quot; the rest of the time. Admittedly, in the first episode, there was an argument that was fairly petty, but it was resolved surprisingly well for this series. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, the fact that Siesta, who was a fairly enjoyable character in the first season, and now even Tabitha, have been reduced to, essentially, characters that just cling to Saito just to cause an issue for Louise, not to mention the fact that Louise constantly takes THEIR affections out on Saito, almost as often as he&#039;s pledged his devotion to her (he does, admittedly, ask for it sometimes) just makes things all the more ridiculous.<br />
<br />
What&#039;s more, there&#039;s a plot device used to keep Siesta around, in that the queen asked her to be Saito&#039;s maid, but thinking about it - Wouldn&#039;t the queen know better than to do this after observing them for, oh, five minutes? Especially given that Siesta&#039;s self-proclaimed &quot;love rival&quot; is the queen&#039;s best friend, and as of season three, sister?<br />
<br />
Ultimately, the flaw with what follows the great first three episodes (or perhaps just great THIRD episode - the first had its share of these problems as well) is that this series is trying to be a harem when it&#039;s got an established romance, and isn&#039;t letting its characters develop like they should in order to keep the harem aspect going when it&#039;s been clear (and even canon) from early on that there is no point to having a harem here.<br />
<br />
Our protagonists have been saying from as early as the second season they love each other, we should not be arriving on the fourth season with the relationship still acting in a standstill, and with Louise acting in the same, petty way she has been all along, guided by shallow plot devices.<br />
<br />
Aside from the romance/harem aspect of the series, however, the plot seems to be shaping up to be as good as always, and development outside of Louise has been decent. We&#039;ve seen how Saito has grown since he&#039;s come to this world, and even how side characters like Guiche have taken to being warriors in their own way. <br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;ll be watching to the end, but unless things improve drastically in regards to Louise and her relationship with Saito this time around, I think I won&#039;t be too sad to see this one end here.

    So.... The 4th season of Zero no Tsukaima, and let me tell you why I scored this so poorly.<br />
<br />
 All through out the whole series Louise has not changed in any aspect what so ever. She still goes on with the same routine, &quot;oh I&#039;m going to trust Saito from now on&quot; and ends up frying his ass at least once in each episode. <br />
This season would have been some what bearable if Louise had some character development, but unfortunately that is not the case.<br />
This also goes for the other characters as well, almost NOBODY has really developed through the series. Because of this each

          <span style="display: none;" id="review52699">
        episode is just the same thing over and over again, and to be honest I&#039;m sick and tired of it. <br />

    I thought i would dislike this season after that mediocre third season, but surprisingly this is the best season of the entire anime, everything is improved and i for once didn&#039;t find Louise and Saito&#039;s realationship pointless and annoying.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
On this season, there&#039;s just two stories to follow, the mission that the queen Henrietta gave both to see what the Pope wants from them and the other story is the finally growing relationship between Louise and Saito, finally there&#039;s not hate-love between them, but more love, more romantic and that was good after a step back in season three.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation<br />
The art and animations really improved,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195456">
        it was colorful and brighter, and smooth, it was the best of the four seasons, the overall was very good.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The sound was the same, with little changes but still was good.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
Finally they developed Louise and Saito, and it was a big improvement, the other characters weren&#039;t behind on improvement neither, finally we get to know more a lot of their background, overall it was very good.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
The only season that i enjoyed a lot and wanted every season to be like this, because i felt like they restarted and improved everything on a good way, the ending left me wanting more, because they finally are together and trusth eachother and i liked how Louise changed from being the kind of tsundere that i hate to a calm tsundere like Taiga when she was with Ryuuji.

    Zero no Tsunami F is the final and last sequel to &quot;Familiar of Zero&quot; series.<br />
 I am very excited to review this show as this was also a pathway for me to enjoy and love anime. Please start with season one.<br />
<br />
 Zero no Tsunami F and it&#039;s prequel may be your classic harem with a Tsusendere and a average boy as your main character with lots of girls surrounding him but this is worth the watch. Giving this show a 8 was a solid score surrounding this series as a whole but could have exceeded my expectations even more.<br />
<br />
 When looking at the 2 main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review172905">
        character which are Louise and Saito. You can really say that there relationship is funny, cute and overdramatic at certain times. When the manga was being adapted into an anime I was surprised that it lasted so long with four seasons completed. Tbh I think everyone had a thrilling ride watching this show.<br />
<br />
 Knowing this was a romantic comedy with a magic theme that had been included gave it a refreshing feeling to the viewer as each sometimes episode contained a element of randomness which gave us a comedic and light refreshing feel towards the show.<br />
<br />
 The anime begins by continuing to describe the adventures that follow the &quot;Hero&quot; Hiraga, Saito and the &quot;unique women&quot; called Le Blanc de La Vallière, Louise Francoise Better known as (Zero Louise) whom has a funny but cute relationship. Reference to the first season is where Saito appears from the human world to Tristein Academy.<br />
<br />
 This anime includes other genres such as comedy and drama that is centred around the main characters. The magic and dramatic elements are given at unexpected moments but that builds up the enjoyment. This however creates a very unique and always different situations between the main characters, but when we observe this situation we can a new picture that is created when a new cloud always get painted over the old. When watching the show you know these characters have a sense of little or no maturity at all (Really pushing it Louise there) and gives them the ability to tackle new challenges with awesome but hilarious methods. This type of lifestyle gives a pretty accurate description of the whole anime and it is pretty different from your usual romantic comedy that we occasionally see from time to time.<br />
<br />
 I find the pacing of the show to be slow/moderate in the viewers point but I am not judge. It tells us a story in a suitable manner that is executed with minor or no flaws at all. This allows the viewer to be entertained with none or little mood swings. If the series was any slower or faster I might have to change my thoughts on the shows progression.<br />
<br />
 Being a romantic comedy anime, It all comes down to Familiar of Zero being able to give us comedic and straight in the face lines. The interactions between different characters gives us different moments in were we just laugh hysterically or cry. You can relate to the characters emotions shown by facial expressions and the uneasy movement they might produce. Being a comedic anime I am certain it will make you laugh and give dramatic moments where you will not feel at ease.<br />
<br />
 Zero no Tsukami is a good way to enter a romantic comedy where you will be laugh away. When the audience try&#039;s to understand the characters I think they will judge them by there personality and how they interact and develop new bonds and feelings which tighten the show all together. This gives the audience a small feeling of the characters current emotions. <br />
 The comedy and drama may not seem new to most but with the addition of random twists and characters gives light to a whole new drama. on Classical comedy being one of them, It depends if the viewer has enjoyed it in which it has altered the opinion of the viewer towards the series. However having some magic included will also draw the audience closer and will have a significant influence on there overall opinion of the show.<br />
<br />
 Again having not read the manga I wouldn&#039;t presume that the anime is way off from its paper counterpart.<br />
<br />
 Having magic integrated into the show gives it a new light.<br />
<br />
 The anime try to tackle the development of relationships between characters through dramatic or random situations and through interactions and actions done by the characters which little by little develops more and more. The difference this show has compared to others of the same genre is how the characters are portrayed and overly influenced. We see the story from the main 2 characters however there is parts that give the views of the other characters as they encounter new challenges and develop new feelings towards them and others.<br />
 Thus telling us Zero no Tsukami gives us an enjoyable watch to take in and remember.<br />
 The design of the characters is well based given the date for this show and its prequel with little or some difference in facial features and expression.<br />
<br />
 The setting is wonderful and gives us a magical theme by the use of different light schemes and scenery. The colour used is simplistic and elegant giving a bright view of the setting.<br />
<br />
 Concluding this review. Zero no Tsukami was giving a different feel compared to its recommendations. I did not know wether I was gonna enjoy it or be completely bored and mad but I am glad I am safe as this turned to be an very good show whom anyone can enjoy no matter your age.<br />
<br />
 Thanks for reading

    This is the fourth season of Zero no Tsukaima,it&#039;s a romantic harem with supernatural powers. As for the story it&#039;s the same good ol story from the last three seasons it starts off with Saito dreaming about Louise and Siesta then he touches Louises boob then wakes up because in his dream he describes her boob as a flat plain and Siesta&#039;s as a Mountain range then Louise blows a hole through the wall with her explosion. I kinda figured i&#039;d start that way, but to be honest I feel like Saito is more of a perv after every season progress. Also i&#039;m starting to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review51277">
        find that when ever a romantic serious moment is about to happen something funny happens for relief.As for the sound&amp;art it&#039;s still the same  from the other three seasons.In conclusion this series isn&#039;t perfect, but since I been watching from season one im hooked. I&#039;ve enjoyed the pass three seasons of this anime and i&#039;m looking forward to this fourth season.Although i&#039;ve only watched one episode I think it&#039;s going to be a good one.<br />

    The final spell is...! Explosion...again?<br />
<br />
AUTHOR&#039;S NOTE: <br />
With 4 seasons under its belt, Zero no Tsukaima has quite the history of being a popular anime. I&#039;m not a fan of magic/fantasy animes but the first season impressed me enough to continue watching the 2nd and 3rd season. The reason why I want to take the final season into account is to wrap Zero no Tsukaima up in a package and show you why it fell into oblivion in its final premise.<br />
<br />
STORY (5/10):<br />
It was expected. Before I even touched the first episode, I closed my eyes and used my clairvoyant magic to predict what this story would

          <span style="display: none;" id="review124067">
        be about. Miraculously, I was able to stay ten steps ahead of the anime, as it went on. An anime with such predictable plot can&#039;t be enjoyed, as viewers like twist and surprises (unless, you don&#039;t...?). I was able to hold my patience for the 1st season, but I had already grown tired of the repetitive storyline at the middle of the 2nd season. I had hoped at the final season, the writers would come up with a well-crafted ending. No, it was not a well-crafted ending, in fact, it left me sitting there unsatisfied and possibly annoyed. For the last season, the writers somehow mustered all of their powers to create as much plot holes as possible, in order to create their own disastrous ending. Even with two worlds they could play with (the real world vs the magic world), the writers could not handle such large responsibilities and decided to keep Japan out of the loop until the very end of the anime.<br />
<br />
There is no storyline in the final season. In 12 episodes, many of them were fillers, while the real plot felt like Groundhog Day, cases of villainy acts which are outdone by the magical words: deux ex machina. This anime should have been re-titled: &quot;Zero, the Duex ex Machina&quot; because that&#039;s all you are going to see in the battles in Zero no Tsukaima F.<br />
<br />
ART (5/10):<br />
A lot of laziness. Since the final season mostly focuses on Halkeginia, we see copy and paste backgrounds and recycled animations. What were the production team thinking? I highly doubt the art will impress viewers, especially if you have been watching the previous seasons. It&#039;s the same old, same old. Dull and inexpensive, even the Academy, which looked detailed and beautiful in the first season now looks like a Barbie playhouse.<br />
<br />
The action scenes aren&#039;t very moving either. And with half of the episodes being fillers, we don&#039;t get to see much action. In fact, the only notable scene in the final season is the final battle...though it&#039;s not impressive at all.<br />
<br />
SOUND (8/10):<br />
Ichiko and Rie Kugimiya must be amazing artists (they are), as they were featured in the OP and the EP for all four seasons. I&#039;ve enjoyed all of the OPs and EPs in the Zero no Tsukaima series and was pleasantly surprised that they were all sung by these two wonderful artists. The OP &quot;I&#039;ll Be There For You&quot; by Ichiko has an adventurous melody which keeps the viewers interested and pumped up while the EP &quot;Kiss Shite Agenai&quot; sung by Kugimiya is catchy and bouncy, which brings the anime to a nice close. However, it does get awkward when the anime begins to take its cliffhangers to a darker turn. The EP seems to disturb whatever emotions the anime tried to display.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS (5/10):<br />
Saito Hiraga has been our main hero of Zero no Tsukaima for four seasons. Throughout these years, I&#039;ve tried to comprehend and analyze his personality and his growth. You want to know what I found out? He&#039;s a tortured boy, leashed and whipped by a girl who has a permanent, problematic personality called here in America...well, a bitch. Now, I know that may sound misogynistic but hear me out, ladies. I don&#039;t care how much you love your man, but if you have any of the personalities of the characters here in Zero no Tsukaima -- please get out of my face. That is extremely unattractive. And having to see Saito still fall for any of these characters is utterly baffling. Despite his mysterious charm towards Louise and the other weirdos in the anime, I applaud his loyalty and patience.<br />
<br />
Louise Françoise Le Blanc de La Vallière is our main heroine. Despite her fancy, bourgeoisie, exaggerated name, her personality does not match to that caliber. If there was a game called &quot;Tsundere&quot;, Louise would be the final boss. A complete super-ultra tsundere, she may become your favorite anime character (if you&#039;re an M) or you may want to slap her upside the head and tell her to shut up (if you&#039;re an S). However, she does a cute side to her -- just don&#039;t provoke her or speak of, think of, or touch another woman. Whether it was a misunderstanding or your true intentions, our heroine will pour down her wrath on you before listening to your reasoning, no matter how convincing they are.<br />
<br />
The villains in Zero no Tsukaima F are not interesting at all. Actually, if you technically take out the characters that have died off extremely quickly or allied with the hero/heroine, there is only one villain in the entire season, which is complete laziness on the production team&#039;s part.<br />
<br />
I feel like we are supposed to learn from the allies and friends more than the hero/heroine. They are willing to sacrifice limbs in order to protect the main characters and we see this in each episode consecutively. Whether they are love rivals, or ex-villains, they always give way to the main characters so they can shine.<br />
<br />
OVERALL (5/10):<br />
I&#039;ve had my share of fun in the first and second season, but it has become too bland. It&#039;s like taking a lick of a never-ending lollipop (Tootsie-pop, anyone?). The Zero no Tsukaima series has given us the perfect picture of a well-versed anime with a lot of potential, slowly rotting around the edges. Although I&#039;ve tried to recall the comedy and romantic moments, I couldn&#039;t fully enjoy the final season due to its poor execution. <br />
<br />
*cough* Louise is overrated. *cough*

    I just finished watching the last episode! ^-^ And I loved it! If you haven&#039;t seen the last episode or the series I suggest you stop reading *Major Spoiler Alert* <br />
<br />
Well I think the ending was cool, but I wanted to see how the parents reacted but.... their reaction was probably WTF and lots of arguing and slapping and etc... ^-^ Haha.... Ya also I wanted to see what happened to them in the end! Did they have kids? how did the maid (is her name sista?) ended up? Oh and the elf chick tiffa! (I really hated her character... I honestly didn&#039;t think the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review57549">
        author needed to add her but then again.... whatever!) so ya! But the series was awesome! 10/10 people! I recommend this to 13+ people! (: Maybe just a little older because of the content but hey your the one watching it. If you enjoy it then hey, don&#039;t mind me. But the series was fabulous I hope the author makes a final OVA for her readers to know how they ended up! Cross your fingers

    Let me just start from the top... hopefully all these emotions and thoughts racing in my mind will still be there by the time I&#039;m done writing this but. I had not expected much from this show, this what almost felt to be half-assed show with nothing in it. Of course... that&#039;s when I first started. Looking back now, this show had absolutely been one of my favorites. How the jokeful beginning, although what back then I had thought to be (when i say beginning i literally mean the first episode) god awful had only contributed to the over all beauty of this anime. This

          <span style="display: none;" id="review151175">
        is one of the few animes that I felt had wrapped up very nicely. There was no&quot;wait, can&#039;t there be an episode where they do this?&quot; Everything had been fulfilled in this anime. The serious moments had only been uplifted as the jokeful ones were meant to be. To be honest, I&#039;m glad there were this many episodes, around 50. Because with this, you can almost feel the full impact of the entire anime. The love between Saito and Louise, their moments together, how they grew to be fond of each other and literally couldn&#039;t live without each other. You could feel the steady tension, the rising emotions and feelings. It had felt like you WERE saito, as each episode (throughout the entire series) had shown you a little bit of their lives. Each and every part, their fights, when they didn&#039;t like each other, when they missed each other, when they loved each other, and everything. This had all contributed to the overall feel of the anime, leaving you with this almost heart ache when the serious moments do come. As I&#039;d like to point out clearly, you could feel the steadiness of the anime, like as if it never skipped. You don&#039;t see them liking each other out of the blue for no reason, you reason with yourself how they got to like each other and it makes sense. It&#039;s not a surprise when you see them admit and say &quot;i love you&quot; because you could feel the steadiness and pacing. After finishing this anime.... I do believe I must call it a flower anime, or some corny stuff like that. An anime that, honestly, in the beginning you don&#039;t even know why you&#039;re watching. It seems to be horrid and god awful and this shouldn&#039;t even exist. However, when you finally finish it, or the more you progress into it, the more you realize that every past action is simply meant to bring about the beauty in the next. It&#039;s a snowball effect, and that&#039;s why at the end you&#039;re left with a big giant freakin snowball in your heart and you are left in a room alone in the dark, where you just realize you finished a beautiful heart-felt anime. (or maybe thats just me). Here&#039;s how I recommend this anime, it will only be beautiful and amazing if you watch this from start to finish. Every screentime ever scene every everything had feelings and emotions that would later bloom. If you are not going to watch this anime from start to finish. Don&#039;t, cus otherwise if you don&#039;t, it is the shittiest anime ever. However, from start to finish, at the end of the day, I could not help but add this as one of my favorites. (also, i had added this to an overall of 10 because, the story and character interactions i simply could not help but feel that this anime is worthy of a 10. Also, this is an overall review of the whole anime. I hope this will still help you in watching the last season or not though.)

    This is my first review, so lets start n_n<br />
Zero no Tsukaima F, maybe the worst season of the ZNT series, plus non of al the Zero no tsukaima seasons were never such a masterpiece, but this season, oh, this!... i never expected such piece of... poop. By the way, let&#039;s start by sections.<br />
<br />
-Character: The same thing as the other season~ &quot;Saito-Kun i love you&quot;, 2 second later &quot;Saito-Kun you stupid dog! EXPLOXION KJSJBHJKFDS!&quot; is really annoying and people get tired of the same thing, sometimes i wish that Louise would be less dumb and pick another one to, at least, make Saito jealous. Also, some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review119875">
        of the enemies that are in te OP, they just appear in 3 chapters and they piss me off, they don&#039;t do Nothing!they just stand there because yes. The same with others. I think the only extras who did something in the anime were Tiffa and Siesta... But just in an echii way. Characters doesn&#039;t exist in this anime: 2<br />
<br />
-Art &amp; Animation: I really like the art, i&#039;ve seen better, but is still something that makes it special, but the problem in this anime is the animation. Sometimes it get&#039;s really lazy, maybe animations were made with sony vegas (ba dum tss): 7<br />
<br />
-Story: Is nothing new, i&#039;ve already seen Saito dissapear and then appear again in the previous seasons, a lot of boobs and and the Saito-lovers and blah blah... Really tedious, at least the fight scenes were enough enjoyable to make me put interest in the anime: 3<br />
<br />
-Sound: Nothing special, is not bad, actually is good, but is really forgettable: 6<br />
<br />
And finally:<br />
-Enjoyment: Did i enojoy the anime? no, is as simple as that, no, i didn&#039;t enjoy it. The scenes who were comedy&quot; it was just a box about to explode of fanservice. In all the anime i just laughed at 1 scene. the fight scenes were really ok, if those scenes weren&#039;t tedious i would enjoy it more.<br />
<br />
-Final Result: the anime is like this: First 8 episodes are fanservice-explosion-conflict-more fanservice- drama-conflict resolved-Fanservice-explosion That&#039;s all, the rest of the episodes are just drama-saito&#039;s gone-drama-saito&#039;s back- conflict resolved- fanservice again. Just like the Third season. It was a waste of time? Mmmmm... let&#039;s say yes: 3/10

    Zero no Tsukaima has been going on to it&#039;s fourth season now, and personally i think it&#039;s not better or worst than it&#039;s other seasons. <br />
<br />
the story, is i think 8/10. i like the plots and every thing, since it makes some exciting moments and all, but mostly i think it&#039;s just the romance, and ecchi that i think are most appealing to Zero no Tsukaima. there&#039;s just A LOT of romance, and ecchi much more than action or comedy. anyone out there who doesn&#039;t like these stuff probably shouldn&#039;t watch it, or rather you shouldn&#039;t even be reading this since there&#039;s three seasons before

          <span style="display: none;" id="review61677">
        this that you may quit already if you don&#039;t like harem. all i could say is that it has some, very little sad part, in my opinion, because of how annoying the argument between Louise and Saito is, rather than the feeling of sadness of their arguments. there might be people out there that totally disagree with that, but i&#039;m just getting it out there. the fighting scene are pretty nice. Well though out of how they fight, how the groups interact and connect to others, especially the ideas of the final weapon, what they used to fight. i it should have more feelings to it, than just fan service.<br />
<br />
the art was pretty ok.. giving it 7/10 probably is the best i could. the pictures and all were very cute and nice looking. the background, the characters designs were just great, but the most thing that i think is lacking are more of the smooth movement of the art. sometime i think the part of a character, such as the hair just move like a paper... note very sooth motion to it, and it doesn&#039;t quite look natural, or realistic to a normal hair, even though it&#039;s not normal hair anyway... the color and designs of all things were nice, but in my opinion it needs a little more smoothness to the movements of the characters.<br />
<br />
the sounds are great, 9/10. it has a nice soundtrack to it at the right moment, whether the situation gets in a bad, or a good mood. the sounds pretty much fits in most of all things in the anime, and it&#039;s very accurate in terms of how it would actually sounds in the reality.<br />
<br />
the characters could be good or bad depending on your own thinking, 8/10. as of that most character to me is pretty normal, but in every anime there are just some characters that just annoys the heck out of you, making you wish there&#039;s not just that character. but those characters are just a need thing so that it would probably make other characters looks better. Louise is just one of the character that just is annoying. this is probably debatable since there&#039;s a lot of different kinds of people in this world, and i think she is, is because of how she act, or what she say to Saito. i&#039;m not a big fan of Saito that much too, since even though he have an important role, it doesn&#039;t even look like he&#039;s even trying in anything, such as, he barely even practice much. he does but not much, since if you had watch what happens in the near to last episode, he has shown to be pretty weak still. he&#039;s only strong probably because of the things that support him, such as his sword. so far the only person in Zero no Tsukaima that i don&#039;t quite like is just Louise, since she can be a lot of a bother, and of course her words are just both cute, but mostly irritating.<br />
<br />
overall i think this anime is worth to watch. if people like anime that has romance as its genre i think this might be a great anime. it&#039;s very enjoyable, relaxing and sometimes it just takes your minds of stuff, like for example i&#039;m writing this review after finished watching this anime, and totally forgot to do the project that is due tomorrow. if you finished all the other seasons and finally going to watch this final season, i hope that you will enjoy the most of it, but don&#039;t get into it that much, that you might attempt to do the thing at the final episode with the plane and the moon. ( trying to not give away any spoilers )

    *As you read please note that the familiar of zero and FOZ are the same thing as Zero no Tsukaima*<br />
<br />
As a finale of a (to say the least) LEGENDARY series in the familiar of zero i had very high expectations. I say that my expectations were above met. You should already know what the familiar of zero (FOZ) is all about but if you don&#039;t go ahead and watch the first 3 seasons before you read this. <br />
<br />
Story-9/10 <br />
With all the annoying things from the 2nd and 3rd seasons (most having to do with being repetitive) I say do it again, push the boundaries of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review100641">
        love (and viewer morals) as far as they can go and see beautiful things come from it. I say that the plot is great but i don&#039;t know how many times i seen the same dang recipe in which you screw up then you make up and from that it&#039;s it only flaw. But there were some new twists here and there.<br />
<br />
Art and Sound-10/10<br />
I cant say that i&#039;m a big critic when it comes to sound but i like both the opening and closing themes. As well as the background music that fits the mood of the scene. All animations were crisp and clean and characters were all looking up-to-par.<br />
<br />
Character-9/10<br />
Characters are probably one of the hugest advantages over animes. I got to say i did not like some of the characters from the start (I&#039;m looking at you Mr. de Gramont) but over time they start to build on you and you accept them. But some characters i think get in the way with the plot and friendships too many times. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment-10/10!<br />
If i could give the enjoyment anything higher i would, but a 10 would have to do. Ah the memories as i look back at this season is such feeling of overwhelming joy. You will laugh, you will be in a state of awe, you will maybe even shed a tear. YOU WILL ENJOY THE FAMILIAR OF ZERO!<br />
<br />
Overall-10/10<br />
This anime shot to the tops of my favorite list for many reasons, it was funny and had romance, loved both of the main characters, and the exact last moment of the last episode led you wanting an extra episode (which can be good). It was just a excellent conclusion to a even more excellent series. If you for any reason are thinking about ignoring the conclusion then DON&#039;T!-Dennis

    How an anime goes from good to very good.<br />
<br />
I rated the previous seasons as following:<br />
Season 1: 6<br />
Season 2 and 3: 7<br />
<br />
The main reasoning behind this, being that especially season 1, had insanely rushed material, and the plot felt lacking. <br />
<br />
Season 4 is a whole different thing, and I am going to explain why.<br />
<br />
The plot/story in this season starts off well made, and interesting. I rushed through this season faster then any of the others. I kinda feel that the whole plot and storytelling style grows on you. You kinda realize that this anime was never ment for slow-paced plot with huge details in how the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186394">
        world works (Log Horizon is a grand example of this). It&#039;s also not all about the realization of the style, it&#039;s about the presentation of  the style in this season, that makes it better then the others. <br />
<br />
For one of the few times in this anime, I have actually understood most of Louise&#039;s actions. I have understood when she got mad at him. (Because, be honest, who didn&#039;t hate the guts out of that girl in the first 1-2 seasons? Atleast I did. I was actually so mad at her at times I was hitting my PC.) The example here comes from when Saito kissed someone he shouldn&#039;t have. And there was no explaining against it. After all, it&#039;s a harem anime, so stuff like this will happen, but I felt that the way Louise and Saito handled it felt rushed and left them both with a weakened relationship. This did not show at all, as their relationship is basically rising every single episode in season 4. <br />
<br />
Many people are giving this season a -1 for lackluster episodes. I am mainly thinking about the mid-episodes where Louise, Saito, Tabitha, and last but not least Siesta is at their mansion. These episodes, are episodes I really like. For me, a person who really falls in love with characters, these are golden. I really enjoy just watching the characters enjoy themselves, and I really enjoy watching Saito and Louise getting together. I personally give more positives due to the season having time for relaxed pure good-feel episodes with lots of HILARIOUS harem. <br />
<br />
In this season, I believe everything improved. Especially the humour. I was actually laughing quite a lot. If you have already finished the season, I am especially thinking of when Tifa enters the room and can&#039;t fit her dress on, Louise goes to help, and her dress just falls off whipping her boobs out. Saito&#039;s face really got me.<br />
<br />
Not just this, but now that Louise treating Saito as a dog became more rarely, it got humourus when she actually did. And as the season progressed in many ways, I also had the feeling that he deserved it. Not like he did in the first seasons, where in my opinion wished Saito to dump Louise and go away with Siesta. <br />
<br />
Siesta is one of the best developed characters in the anime if you ask me. Her personality is so easy to spot and is really amazingly developed in a way that you feel like you really, really know her. She is a very humourus character. I can&#039;t count how many times she made me laugh this season, and each laugh made me love her more. This one scene, when Louise and Siesta is talking about what I remember as potentional enemies, and Siesta brings up Tabitha&#039;s dragon. When Siesta impersonates the dragon, is the best Siesta moment in my opinion.  (If anyone has a YT clip or gif from this, please PM me as I really wanna see this again.)<br />
<br />
As it goes for the op song in this season, I have to say I am a bit disappointed. It did not live up to it&#039;s previous season 3 op, and of course First kiss from season 1. FIRST KISS KARA HAJIMARU! <br />
<br />
The ending was for me, settling. I love endings that leave you fed up (not in a bad way) with the anime. There are no questions to be answered, and everything went as you had hoped. This ending had that, and I loved every second of the last couple of episodes. <br />
<br />
As an ending to my review, I thank the developers of this anime for an amazing ride. I am very glad I picked this anime up, and I am very glad I continued watching after a lackluster season 1. This anime and especially season 4, have given me tons of laughs and tears. Tears of sadness and joy from the last episode.

        After completing the previous three seasons of the show, I will say the final season lived up to my expectation, with significantly more story development than the season 1 and season 3.  Zero f begins by finishing off the cliff-hangers from last season, followed by a few light-heart comedic episodes, and finally develop into a final, climatic arc. If you are a fan of the light novel, the last arc is probably not to your liking, as it derives significantly from the book. However, if you have not read the novel, the arc  is quite satisfying, especially the ending.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review56909">
        The ending is perhaps one of the most complete ending (as in no loose end) I have seen.<br />
  Overall, if you have watched the previous three seasons, this season still retains what makes the series great, the comedy and the ecchiness. An improvement over previous seasons is an increase in character development (which will be more apparent if you have watched the previous seasons). If you have not watched any of the previous seasons, I suggest you give the series a try if you are a fan of comedy or fantasy.  <br />

    I have watched the first three seasons of the anime, and was actually awaiting the final season of Zero no Tsukaima witho a lot anticipation. I will address each of the following elements in order:<br />
<br />
Story (5)<br />
<br />
The plot of the final season is borderline nothing special to a disappointment. The character interactions are just basically repeated. The females that were all gaga over Saito continue to fight for his love and every episode has its share of big boobs. I was very disappointed in the way the story line tossed away the struggle against Joseph, King of Galia. Compared to the stories behind the previous seasons,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review91559">
        the final season seems like it&#039;s composed of 6 legit episodes and then 6 fillers. <br />
<br />
Art (7)<br />
<br />
The artwork is the same as it has been in the previous seasons. I never regarded the art in this anime a masterpiece, but I didn&#039;t hate it either. It&#039;s alright.<br />
<br />
Sound (7)<br />
<br />
The music does get very repetitive depending on the style of the scene, but the previous seasons of this anime have already prepared me to expect this so there wasn&#039;t any disappointment there. Given the mediocre storytelling, I guess the makers complimented it with mediocre sound choices.<br />
<br />
Character (7)<br />
<br />
Some new characters are introduces and they are as cliche as you will find them in any anime.<br />
If you have seen previous seasons, then the characters remain pretty much the same as they were.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (7)<br />
<br />
It&#039;s definitely enjoyable. I don&#039;t think anyone was expecting a masterpiece out of this one.<br />
<br />
Overall (7)<br />
<br />
Viewers may find this season a bit disappointing if they were anticipating it. Upon closer examination, the final season is really what we all expected: a light, entertaining, cliche, conclusion to the Familiar of Zero series. Not too good. Not bad. Meh.

     Zero no Tsukaima F is the last season and the 4th season of the zero no taukaima series. Before i write my review i would like to tell u about this particular story. It is a fantasy romantic harem. This harem is not a harem where the guy likes all the  girls but the girls like that one guy. The guy likes only one girl tho. Saito and Loiuse has developed a relationship over the past seasons. This relationship is like a master to pet relation. the girl is tsundere so if u like that u might like this. In a harem anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review71495">
        most of the time all the girls are different. from tsundere to nice and calm to big breasted. this anime has this which makes this a great harem anime. the story is great. it is very intresting. the story also develops tye characters and the enjoyment. the music is good too  having them in the right parts and the voice acting is great. the art is great however is not as great as the new anime thatbhas been coming out. I think the author wanted to keep the classic view of the art caz the previous ones were like that too. This siries.is a must watch

    This is a great ending, to one of the most enjoyable anime out there, the story is not the most complex, but it is simple and different, and it follows the previous seasons very well. This season had a lot of romance too, and some nice action scenes<br />
Zero no tsukaima F concludes the story in a great way and like I said it may not have the best plot or characters, but it is very enjoyable and fun to watch, the mix of comedy romance action and fan service is very good, if you don&#039;t like ecchi it might annoy you, but if you got

          <span style="display: none;" id="review74791">
        over to the last season then it won&#039;t be a problem.<br />
Story(9/10) - Great, has a good ammount of romance, it has a great ending and yu get to see character development.<br />
Art (9/10) - pretty good, beautiful characters, good animation but not perfect, some details on animation make it a 9 instead of a 10.<br />
Sound (8/10) - Great voice acting, the music is good but not great.<br />
Character (9/10) - Even though they are cliche, they feel unique in some way or another, and each character gets some development even though it focuses on the two main characters, we get to see more about the princess and other characters, wich is pretty nice. Even tough louise may get boring at sometimes, she is still very enjoyable.<br />
Overall (9/10) - One of the most enjoyable anime to watch ever, even tough it may be cliche at some times, it will be enjoyable and fun to watch till the very end, and the beautiful romance between the two main characters is a plus.

    Meh, so if you&#039;re reading this you&#039;ve probably watched the other 3 seasons of Louise and chums, and if you haven&#039;t, watch those first.  Firstly as you&#039;ll understand what&#039;s going on and second, as this show gets progressively worse with every season. <br />
<br />
I can only rate it as mediocre at best and somewhat dissapointing.  It may have been a while since I watched the previous seasons but I&#039;m sure this season relied more heavily on fan-service.  Which isn&#039;t always a bad thing, especially if you enjoy boob comedy (or lack of) and tsunderes, but if it&#039;s in lieu of a decent story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review60683">
        then it can get a bit weak over 12 episodes.  They probably shouldn&#039;t have bothered. <br />
<br />
So yeah, watch it if you like Louise, Tifa or Siesta, or their seiyuus but other than that, it&#039;s a bit poor and really, as a swan-song, it could/should have been better.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve given it 6/10; was probably being kind.<br />
<br />

    Well its been a massive roller coaster of The Magical Misadventures of Saito and friends. Still left to wonder how this managed to get a budget enough to make 4 seasons of it.<br />
<br />
Season fours story stick to that of previous in the fact of when something happens it only stays for an episode, two if you&#039;re lucky. However the finale does hold out for almost an entire four episodes for the final climax of the season, a new record as far as this series is concerned. Doesn&#039;t stop the fact it seems like each episode could have been only 6 minutes long if you cut

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182366">
        out all the pointless scenes.<br />
<br />
Art, and the term is used loosely, has barely improved and in some areas it seemed to have gotten worse. Most notable on faces, half the time they lack any real emotion or they were so crudely done you cant see half of it. Then there&#039;s the little moments, such as hair waving when dancing, moves a hell of a lot more than it really should.<br />
<br />
Music went back to its season 2 type. Good proper pieces that didn&#039;t end in just a minute or two, it lasted though the duration of the scene or battle. It however doesn&#039;t stop that some sounds and light pieces are reused a few times too many and still the faint lurking sound of background static during slow silent scenes, should you have ears and headphone acute enough to notice it.<br />
<br />
Character brought in some new developments as there was one part it could have turned into a massive romantic drama scandal or taken a huge twist on the main characters love life. but it&#039;s quickly dismissed later on as if it never happened which is utterly mind boggling as to why something meant to be a serious thing is brushed off as a minor issue. And this doesn&#039;t happen just once, it happens a few times throughout this season, some worse than others but they&#039;re more or less treated the same way.<br />
<br />
Overall enjoyment when going into this season was low. Personal note, i just wanted it over and done with and ended up taking a two week hiatus from it. But upon returning to finish the final few episodes, it was pleasing to see that it actually picked up on its action, story and drama to the point where it actually got rather interesting. Apart form the fact of the realism when obtaining such high grade weapons, goes completely out the window and more dead things return from the grave than a zombie movie, it was a much improved ending other previous seasons as greatly acceptable considering the disappointment of its predecessors.
