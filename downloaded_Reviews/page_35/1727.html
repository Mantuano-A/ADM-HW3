    If I learned something from watching Gabriel DropOut, is that going to hell is definitely the superior option. Get ready for this hilarious comedy that reverses the roles of angels and demons!<br />
<br />
The story is simple but interesting due to the comedic setting it creates: our protagonist, Gabriel, was a kind, top tier angel who always helped others. However, after coming to Earth she developed an addiction to online videogames and became incredibly lazy. From there we meet other angels and demon with personalities that don&#039;t fit the standards we give to them, creating lots of great comedic situations playing around that. Going back to Gabriel,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243678">
        I love how much of an asshole she can be to the others, it&#039;s a fun twist to the happy and kind main protagonist we usually have in these type of stories.<br />
<br />
Playing that role instead, we have Vignette, an “angelic demon” if that makes sense. Being completely different to Gabriel, she is a very responsible and kind-hearted girl who is always there to help and bring happiness to everyone around her. How can a demon be this pure? No idea, but I can already tell you that she has some of the most heart-melting smiles that anime can provide. Next we have Satania, the cutest, most “evil” demon that exists. In order to conquer the Earth, she will do things as terrifying as refusing to do her homework or recycling a water bottle with the cap still on. I&#039;m genuinely scared, I swear! As scary and powerful as she wants to be, she still miserably fails at everything and is the constant subject of bullying from Gabriel, and especially from Raphiel, that completes the main cast. Don&#039;t let her angelical looks fool you, she&#039;s a sadist that has teasing Satania as her favorite pastime. I have no idea what&#039;s going on in heaven to have girls like this as the most promising angels. <br />
<br />
Gabriel DropOut has the biggest concentration of best girls I have seen in quite a good time, all of them are great and likeable, and the interactions between them are so fun to watch. It doesn’t matter who you choose as your favorite, secondary characters like Tapris, an adorable angel that surprisingly behaves like an angel included, you are picking a great and lovable character.<br />
<br />
The character design, backgrounds, and overall art style of this anime is well executed but nothing mindblowing. I felt that compared to other Doga Kobo works it didn&#039;t have as many impressively animated scenes as usual, however, the story itself doesn&#039;t really have that many moments for them to happen, and when there is the chance, they are done and look great, so I have no objections. In the sound department is mostly what I expected from a comedy anime, with songs that fit well with the tone, but aren&#039;t really that memorable. The same can&#039;t be said for both the opening (Gabriel Drop Kick) and the ending (Hallelujah☆Essaim) two great songs sung by the voice actors of our four main characters that are two personal favorites of this season. From the opening I especially love the part where the tone of the music adapts to whichever character is singing, using a calmer tone for the angels and a more intense one for the demons. The ending theme is mostly made by nice looking still shots together with the really catchy song.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, Gabriel DropOut is a very entertaining comedy anime that plays with the interesting idea of angels and demons and subverts your expectations of what their personalities should be like.   I personally had a blast watching it, really enjoying each episode and getting so attached to the characters over the course of the series. I can&#039;t see how an anime that made me look forward for the Mondays doesn&#039;t deserve to be a favorite of mine heh, I highly recommend this anime to anyone looking for a nice comedy series to watch!<br />

    My opinion:<br />
At first glance, Gabriel Dropout seems nothing special and definitely does not stand out but it is actually a hilarious show that had me laughing till my stomach hurt.<br />
Quality wise Gabriel Dropout is not very good, it has a simple generic plot with some of the most stereotypical characters I have seen but that did not stop the show from being so damn entertaining.<br />
I’ve decided to write this review in a more lively manner that better suits the show, doing so was fun.<br />
<br />
Story: 6/10<br />
Upon passing a school in heaven, graduating angels are sent down to Earth with the duty to learn about and guide

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243704">
        humans towards the correct path in order to become full-fledged angels. Gabriel is the top angel in her class, dreaming about going to Earth and helping people but as soon as she actually arrives on Earth she becomes addicted to video games and turns into a complete slob as a result. The story follows Gabriel, along with other angels and demons who have descended to Earth, as they attend high school.<br />
<br />
The plot is not complex or linear but rather simple with episodes presenting different stories that more often than not, do not relate to other episodes, but that doesn’t stop the overall story from feeling fluid.<br />
<br />
In this world, demons often behave like little angels while angels behave like pseudo-demons, twist which I really liked. On one hand, we have the angel Gabriel saying she doesn’t care about humans and joking about destroying humanity to cover up her “pantie sighting”, on the other hand, we have the demon, Vignette, who often cares for Gabriel, worries about other angels and even plays with children in the park. This “change of roles” goes to show that what you are doesn’t always describe or define the way you act.<br />
Finally, the jokes. This show sells its humour very well with the main source of humour being the character chemistry, the interrelations of the characters are well-done and often result in hilarious situations that cracked me up. <br />
<br />
To be honest, it is quite dumb to say angels are born like humans and that they live and behave like families, that’s very far from the way it actually is but, what am I talking about? This is a comedy so I’ll let it slide.<br />
<br />
Characters: 7/10<br />
The character cast is small yet effective, working well together and almost always perfectly delivering the jokes. The characters are more like antithesis of their archetype, with angels acting like demons and vice versa, which was quite a clever touch to the show<br />
To be honest, the cast of Gabriel Dropout consists of some of the most generic tropes I’ve seen in anime but they work so well together and are so likable that it doesn’t matter if they are generic or not.<br />
<br />
Gabriel is an angel who was the top of her class but soon after her descent to Earth, she became addicted to video games and turned into a slob. She is often lazy and unmotivated and has a rather bossy attitude, which I could relate to since that is the way I was in highschool, like many other teenagers. An angel got corrupted by the human way of living, that is hilarious and also true, humans are social beings that will adapt to society and because angels are portrayed to be so much like humans, it is only natural that they would react like humans.<br />
<br />
Vignette is the complete opposite of Gabriel, she is very responsible and often looks after Gabriel, contrary to her actual role as a demon. She often cooks and worries about others, she’s an “angelic demon” to call it that. I find her character to be the best and the most intriguing.<br />
<br />
Satanichia, she’s an egotistical demon who often thinks of weird ways to cause mischief which usually end in failure. She has no sense of taste and is often pestered by Raphiel and often falls victim to stray dogs. <br />
If I was to give Satanichia a role, it would be that of the failed villain because her “devious” acts and plans often end up in failure due to her stupidity. I personally found her character a bit irritating but not bothersome.<br />
<br />
Raphiel is the second ranked angel in Gabriel&#039;s class, who has since become a sadistic stalker who takes delight in teasing Satanichia. I found her character hilarious due to her constant teasing of Satanichia which I could relate to, since I used to do the same to my friends but on a smaller scale.<br />
<br />
Aesthetics: 7/10<br />
The art and animation are lively and colorful, the characters’ facial expressions are well done and fitting for the show. Aside from one beach episode, there wasn’t much fan service, lack of fan service which I found great. Overall, the art and animation are good but nothing spectacular, it gets the job done.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
Having a nice opening theme, a decent ending theme and a pretty good OST with the voice actors doing a good job interpreting the characters, I would say the overall sound was good.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
Personally, I was laughing for the entire duration of the show, even though some jokes were overused I still found them funny, maybe because I was in the mood for a comedy show. Anyway, I highly enjoyed this show and I don’t regret one second of it.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
A very good comedy show that stands out not because it has great quality production but because it is highly entertaining. <br />
If you are looking for a lighthearted show that will give you a good laugh, I recommend giving Gabriel Dropout a try.

    Every now and then, I often go through a bucket list of things when deciding to pick up a new anime. Make no mistake, Gabriel Dropout’s list consists of some of the most generic tropes you’ll discover in anime. Does that automatically make the show unwatchable? Absolutely not. I mean, the show is like a soup with all sort of generic ingredients in it to bring out the flavor. However, it’s a show that can also be a delight for fans who wants to see some colorful entertainment.<br />
<br />
On the surface, the series doesn’t really stand out much. It’s essentially about angels and demons who have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243676">
        descended to Earth to learn about humans and their life style. Main female protagonist Gabriel “Gab” graduated at the top of her class but upon landing on Earth, she becomes a lazy hikikomori who is more interested in video games than anything else. It doesn’t take long for viewers to understand what her character is like as the first episode establishes her role as pretty straightforward. The other characters also take little time to make their way into the story as well. <br />
<br />
As a slice of life story, there’s not much linear storyline or complex plot going on. Every episode consists of segments that makes up for its storytelling. In fact, most episodes can consist of multiple storytelling segments with little relations to another. However, what makes this show special is the character cast. It’s a small yet effective character cast that consists of Gab, Vigne, Satania, and Raphiel. Gab and Raphiel are the angels while Satania and Vigne are the demons. Contrary to what viewers may expect, these characters are more like antithesis of their archetype. Gab hardly has an angelic personality but is instead portrayed with a lazy and spoiled attitude. Satania is pretty much a harmless villain as her devious behavior is often overshadowed by her own idiocy. The idea is that these characters all came to Earth to adapt with society. Yet, they have their own motives that is satirized by comedy. <br />
<br />
Speaking of which, the humor of this show plays a big role to fulfill enjoyment. Like most comedy/slice of life stories, it tries to sell its humor and does it quite well. The most effective way it does so is with the character chemistry. With such a small cast of characters, we can easily see how their relationships are without overthinking it. Take Satania and Raphiel for instance. Raphiel often teases Satania while the latter tries to cause mischief with hilarious results. On the other hand, Satania always tries to “compete” with Gab but somehow falls short for whatever reason that comes up. Vigne stands at the middle ground as she a more mature character yet also has her own outrageous moments. That being said, the show also introduces some lesser impactful characters that spice up the character chemistry. One of the more noticeable characters though is Tap, an angel that adds her own bits of magic into this show. In retrospect, the key success to these characters isn’t how their roles are portrayed but rather how they bring the show’s humor to life.<br />
<br />
As a manga reader, the adaptation is faithful but doesn’t follow every chapter in a linear order. I can also say with disappointment that there were some chapters that should have been adapted. As a standard 1-cour show of 12 episodes, it’s not all too surprising. In the meantime, the humor can be a hit or miss for some fans. Its attempt to sell comedy will not meet everyone’s standards and from the first episode, it can be the deciding factor of keep or drop. Finally, I have to admit that Gabriel Dropout lacks character development. There’s not much change to any of the main characters while we don’t learn much background story about them either. While some could say that slice of life stories like this doesn’t need them, it can still be disheartening for fans who are more interested in those elements.<br />
<br />
Adapted by Doga Kobo, the show is quite colorful. Literally, every character stands out in some way from their different hair colors and their extra accessories. (Gab’s halo, Satania’s devil-like hair piece, Raphiel’s crosses, etc) Production quality is also simple yet effective to bring out the gimmicks. There’s not much fan service (although there’s a beach episode) so expect more or less comedy as the series’ main way of servicing the fans. The character expressions also works quite well to supplement with the show’s humor.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack isn’t all too impressive although it gets down the idea right for its OP and ED theme songs. What should feel impressive is the character voice mannerisms. They fit them so well. Gab’s voice really makes her sound like a lazy sloth while Satania’s devilish laughs gives her the impressions of a devil. By the time I finished watching Gabriel Dropout, I felt like the character voices really outdid themselves.<br />
<br />
Should you watch Gabriel Dropout? It sounds like a tough question but really has a simple answer. If you fancy comedy without relevancy with its storytelling, then this is the show for you. It has humorous gags and characters shine with their personalities. However, if you’re more into something serious or development in storytelling, then look elsewhere. For me, this series has the virtue of being funnier than what it looks like. Now that’s a certain kind of fun.<br />

    Doga Kobo might not be the absolute biggest name in the anime industry but if there is one thing they have truly made a name for themselves for, then it is their aptitude at making moe comedies. With an repertoire including the likes of Himouto Umaru-chan, New Game and of course the legendary Yuru Yuri among others, this is truly the studio&#039;s specialty. Adding to this lineup, this season we now have Gabriel DropOut, which once again showcases just how to make this genre shine at its very brightest.<br />
<br />
Gabriel DropOut can briefly be described as role-reversed angels and demons turned moe. The story mainly follows

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243683">
        two angels and two demons, who all end up moving from Heaven and Hell respectively to the human world upon starting high school. The catch is that the angels in question are a lot less admirable than you might expect, whereas the demons are not particularly evil. It is a simple twist on paper, but it ends up working to great comedic effect more often than not in this rather mean-spirited comedy show.<br />
<br />
Given the nature of the anime, it is unsurprisingly largely character-driven. First of all there is the show&#039;s supposed main character Gabriel, named after the archangel. She is someone who used to be a picture-perfect angel with the most pristine, beautiful smile whose sole intention was to spread as much happiness as possible in the human world. That is until she one day randomly ends up playing an MMO as a healer in order to help the other players (how the game ended up on her laptop in the first place is never explained but whatever), only to find that people were dying when she ran out of mana, causing her to purchase an exclusive premium healing staff for real money in desperation. And this turns to be the starting point of Gabriel quickly going down a slippery slope until she eventually becomes a self-centered game addict and a hikikomori. In other words, basically a lost cause and in this case a fallen angel. She is rather reminiscent of Doma Umaru from Himouto Umaru-chan in this sense, but Gabriel is even more hopeless since unlike Umaru she 1) does not put in any effort in school or try to keep up appearances either, and 2) fully embraces the NEET lifestyle and does not even try to improve herself whatsoever, much to the dismay of her friends.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, her best friend is Vigne (who I think is supposed to represent the demon Vine but I am not sure), a very diligent and kind-hearted demon who only wants to help people. Her devotion manages to get Gabriel to at least get out of her room and attend school sometimes, but unfortunately that is not the way demons are supposed to behave, and thus she sometimes finds herself in just as much trouble as Gabriel regarding lack of financial support from back home. The poor girl just cannot find it in herself to be evil as much as it is expected from someone in her position.<br />
<br />
Someone who most definitely wants to be as evil as possible though is the so-called &quot;future queen of hell&quot; Satanichia—more commonly known as Satania—which is quite obviously a feminized version of Satan. She is perhaps the real star of this show as most of its funniest gags revolve around her... or rather her misfortune. Put simply, Satania is an idiot, and her attempts at being evil always end in complete failure. Also, the other girls are generally pretty mean to her in return for all the nuisances she creates. This is undoubtedly the most mean-spirited part of the show as Satania is most often treated as the butt of everyone else&#039;s jokes, but it works out surprisingly well because of the light-hearted nature of it all (and let us be honest here, quite a lot of the abuse she is given is well deserved).<br />
<br />
Although pretty much everyone has a piece of Satania every now and then, the main culprit behind Satania&#039;s torment however is the fourth and final of our main characters: Raphiel (named after the archangel Raphael). She is a former classmate of Gabriel&#039;s from their days up in Heaven, and whilst she may look like a model honor student at a glance, she is actually both a sadist and a huge troll whose favorite pastime is manipulating and toying with Satania in various ways. As she already proved in Prison School, HanaKana is surprisingly adept at voice acting sadistic girls, and the case with Raphiel&#039;s character is no different.<br />
<br />
There is not much in the way of actual plot progression throughout the show. There are a couple backstory segments showcasing how Gabriel and Vigne first met, and in some of the latter episodes we also get to see some more glimpses of what Heaven and Hell look like when the girls temporarily go back home on vacation, which also lets us meet their families. Beyond that though, the show mostly consists of standalone skits (usually like four segments per episode or so), however that is totally fine because this is purely a comedy show at heart, and quite a lot of the time it is actually legitimately hilarious. I cannot actually label it as the comedy of the season for the simple reason that KonoSuba 2 happened to be airing simultaneously, but during any normal circumstances it certainly would be. Granted, humour is very subjective so I cannot promise anything, but at the very least I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed every single episode of the series.<br />
<br />
Gabriel DropOut is not a complicated series, but it executes its own premise excellently and delivers a consistently enjoyable and momentarily hilarious experience. Combined with Doga Kobo&#039;s typical clean and shiny moe art style (and a fantastic ED I might add), it all amounts to one of the best moe comedies I have seen in quite some time.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: For whatever reason, Crunchyroll&#039;s subtitles for this anime are absolutely cringeworthy. In what universe does &quot;Itadakimasu~&quot; translate to &quot;Through the Dark Lord Amen&quot; if I may ask? Keep your 4chan memes away from my subs please, because if you think you are being funny I am sorry to disappoint you. Hopefully some fansub group will pick this show up and retranslate it from scratch sometime in the near future so that it might actually be bearable to read.

    There are two ways I look at Gabriel DropOut. One is as a CGDCT anime and the other is as a comedy. While the two usually go very well together I separate the two of them for a reason. As a CGDCT anime Gabriel DropOut is alright. Vinge and Satania are cute, and at least Gabriel has a cute design, even if her personality is annoying. However, as a comedy anime it is painful.<br />
<br />
The biggest issue I have with Gabriel DropOut is that it&#039;s not funny. Many of the jokes all boil down to the same thing: &quot;The angels act like demons and the demons

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243721">
        act like angels.&quot; That&#039;s actually an interesting idea but the problem is it&#039;s not very funny. And it&#039;s certainly not funny enough to fill up 12 episodes. However, still the show likes to repeat this joke over and over and over and over again. That and Satania bullying (having funny mean things happen to Satania) is the bread and butter that this show has. Both of which got boring pretty quickly. They do sometimes mix in other jokes but even those jokes fall flat most of the time because it&#039;s predictable how they end up. Some of them are jokes I&#039;ve seen from other shows in the past. The execution of these shows as well tends to be lackluster. There isn&#039;t enough variation in the setup or the punchline of the joke so it only adds to that samey feeling. Comedy is subjective but I have a hard time understanding what&#039;s so funny about this show. Rather it&#039;s attempts at humor usually annoy me more than anything.<br />
<br />
The characters range from good to incredibly grating. As it turns out the demons fall into the former camp while the angels fall into the latter camp. Satania is dumb but can be pleasant to watch due to her attitude and the life she brings to the show. Vigne is basically a normal girl as a demon so like a normal girl, she&#039;s cute as well. I wouldn&#039;t consider either of the characters very well developed as the show never really pulls them apart from their normal behaviour or gets them into situations where they have to grow. There was a moment with Vigne where she showed some more depth but for the most part, the show lacks in that department. That said the two demons are fine characters and at least are likeable. The issue with these two is that it depends on who they&#039;re paired up with for how enjoyable each segment is. They&#039;re usually paired with the angels which sadly doesn&#039;t help them out.<br />
<br />
Gabriel is a whole mess of issues. First off she&#039;s basically an okatu character played straight. She&#039;s never more interesting than that, and her cynicism and her lack of caring get really annoying to watch. It&#039;s even more so annoying when they make up this backstory of her being a perfect little angel before getting tainted by the modern world and video games. That actually could have been an interesting story if Gabriel cared about retaining her angelic nature and if it happened slowly through time. Instead, it takes one night, throwing out all illusion of having character development or depth in exchange for a cheap laugh that isn&#039;t even funny. What&#039;s worse than her bland and uninteresting personality is that there&#039;s nothing that makes her likeable. She usually ends up acting pretty mean to her friends, which only serves to make her character less likeable. Thusly. I have no reason to want to see her on the screen nor care about her well-being. It even hurts her cuteness because she has a great design yet it&#039;s hard to really adorable or enjoy the looks of someone who I don&#039;t like. The ruins part of the magic that could be there.<br />
<br />
Raphael is a sadist, and if she had any redeemable traits that&#039;d be ok. But she doesn&#039;t. Rather she&#039;s pretty much a sadist and nothing else. Her target of prey is poor Satania. Sometimes this works well and is funny but most of the time it doesn&#039;t. Satania bullying only really works when Satania is being played due to her own faults. Otherwise, it&#039;s cruel and seems unfair for poor Satania. What did she do to deserve being bullied? She has her flaws but not enough to justify the amount of bullying she receives in the show. I personally have a problem with characters getting mistreated whether by the world or by other characters and since it ends up happening so often it only adds to the annoyance that this show can provide. But going back to Raphael, that is the main point of interest with her, and probably the only notable one. And like Gabriel, she gives no reason to like her, and thusly she&#039;s annoying to have to watch, as well as again being a bland character. <br />
<br />
Unlikeable characters are fine when there is a purpose behind them. Say if they are villains, or if they&#039;re used well for comedy. However, the comedy gotten from these characters are stale and not worth while. Furthermore, they clash against the notion of caring about the girls which hurts the CGDCT aspect of the show. The show doesn&#039;t work that well all together, and the root of the cause is its failed comedy. Thusly, I imagine how one feels about Gabriel DropOut depends on how funny one finds it. If one finds it funny then it&#039;s some of these problems feel like less of an issue. But personally I didn&#039;t, and thusly I relied on the characters to win me over. While Vinge and Satania worked, the angels did not, at least for me.<br />
<br />
Despite Gabriel DropOut&#039;s poor attempts at humor there were a couple of episodes that did shine. These episodes proved that the show can throw in some good material when it wants to. There is a later character that appears named Tapris who is proof of this. However, the show spends more time mulling around the same jokes to really go anywhere and that&#039;s it&#039;s loss. <br />
<br />
The art and animation were solid throughout but never seemed notable enough to give it praise. The music was ok, although I don&#039;t really care for the OP very much.<br />
<br />
Overall the show is inconsistent and has issues with its humor and its characters, however, it is pretty cute and does have some merits. This is a show that you can probably tell whether you&#039;ll like it or not from the first couple of episodes. They never really move on from that type of material. Personally, I don&#039;t recommend it but there are worse shows to watch.<br />
<br />
<br />
An unimportant note: The CR subs for this show were absolute trash. They kept on inserting random jokes instead of translating the actual line. Although that&#039;s CR&#039;s fault not Gabriel DropOut&#039;s fault.

    An angel and demon comedy, I&#039;ve definitely seen something similar to this before... *eyes hataraku maou-sama*<br />
<br />
Let me start by saying that this anime was a lot better than I thought it would be. Normally, I like to wait for anime to finish airing before I watch them, but this season I wanted to try something different - so I chose something I thought would be average. So far, this anime seems to be pure comedy with no plot to be seen - just four cute girls living their lives on Earth, doing cute things.<br />
<br />
However, even without a plot, it&#039;s not at all boring nor average

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239542">
        like I had assumed it would be.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a very silly slice of life and the past 4 episodes have been really enjoyable. It&#039;s nothing outstanding, but definitely something that will keep you excited when the next episode comes out. The OP and ED are also very pleasing and impossible to skip over (at least in my opinion), they give that familiar vibe that gets you excited for what&#039;s next to come in the show.<br />
<br />
The characters are very likeable, funny and their character designs are simple but still stand out. The roles of angels and demons have switched; the demons are pure while the angels are immoral/careless. Our first angel and the main protagonist, Gabriel, was once a hardworking student and is now a lazy shut-in who skips school and couldn&#039;t care less about anything other than her MMO&#039;s. Raphiel, the 2nd angel, happens to be a very mischievious character who slyly portrays herself as the nice girl. And the last two demons are Vignette: a very mature demon, and Satania: a demon who tries too hard to be evil but fails miserably.<br />
<br />
If you enjoyed anime like New Game, K-ON, Love Live!, then you might enjoy this as it has cute girls doing cute things, BUT the main thing that differentiates them from Gabriel DropOut is that they have ambitions while GD does not, but instead offers only a cute comedy.<br />
<br />
This anime is nothing new and original, but it does a good job with what it has. Overall, I would recommend to give this anime a shot! It&#039;ll be worth it, and you might even receive a new favorite character.<br />
<br />
***might be updated***<br />

    Gabriel Dropout was genuninly a nice surprise for me. Coming into this show with hardly any expectations whatsoever, I left feeling satisfied with a fun show with good comedy and a cast of characters that I actually liked by the end. This show doesn&#039;t do anything remarkable in terms of its narrative or characters but it remains a fun ride throughout, and the characters are both enjoyable enough, and their chemistry between each other feels natural enough to carry the weight of the show.<br />
<br />
Gabriel Dropout is about a fallen angel named Gabriel, who visits Earth originally as a means of learning more about Earth culture

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243701">
        (but only visits Japan to achieve this, ignoring all of the other hundreds of cultures but, hey whatever), but, as she becomes addicted to the world of online gaming, she falls into depravity, changing from a sweet, kind &quot;butter wouldn&#039;t melt&quot; type character to the lazy, self-centred lie about. During the duration of the show, she meets new demons and reunites with old angel friends who have yet fallen and have come to Earth to learn more about its culture and customs. And that&#039;s pretty much it for the narrative. The rest of the show involves the characters in random situations and scenarios, that gets funnier as the show goes along. It took a little while for me to warm up to the show, I think the first three episodes, while still being fine, were not as interesting overall as the latter. When the characters had all been introduced, I was having much more fun with the show overall, mainly due to how fun all of the characters are in this series. While the individual archetypes for the characters had been done before, each one bounces off of each other rather effectively and there is a good enough variety in jokes (for the most part that is) to carry the comedy. There were a few moments in which the comedy was a little TOO stupid for my taste, such as when Satania takes the dog and travels all the way to a far off land; my main problem is that the joke went on for too long. Similarly, there were also some jokes that I felt were either unfunny or kind of fell flat on their face, but these moments didn&#039;t take too much away from the show to the point where it ruined it for me and these moments were few and far between.<br />
<br />
What is also interesting as a dynamic is that two of the character&#039;s archetypes, that being an angel and a demon, are switched around, and while I wouldn&#039;t go as far as to call this a subversion of themes or anything, this addition still adds another layer onto the comedy of the show. In terms of characters, there are four central ones; two demons and two angels. Gabriel, as previously mentioned, is the fallen angel who spends the majority of her time playing games and just generally being a worthless member of society. She has her share of funny lines and personality traits, but most jokes with her are just about her lifestyle. Granted, as the series went on, the comedy with her became more funnier, as a result of the more expressive reactions the voice actress and the animators could muster. Vignette, was also a fun character who plays the straight man, or straight woman in this case and despite being a demon, she is perhaps one of the kindest and sweetest people ever. We have Raphiel, another angel who spends most of the time laughing at the expense of the other characters or laughing at Satania, who, in my eyes is the best character in the show.<br />
<br />
Satania is essentially a wannabe arch demon who thinks she is evil as all hell, but her attempts at being evil come down to her announcing that she hasn&#039;t done her homework boldly in class or starting a fight over a dog who keeps stealing her melon bread. She is delightful and fun to watch, as she attempts all of these various &quot;evil&quot; plots and schemes which always amount to her getting the short end of the stick in the end. There are other characters, such as Gabriel&#039;s older sister who makes an appearance in the final episode and is charming in her own way but for the main crust of the show, it focuses on these four, which isn&#039;t so bad considering how fun they all are. The show just needed a little more variety in order to bump the score up a little more higher. In terms of animation, the show has a very bright colour pallet and the animation, particularly in the final episode is great. It was produced by the same people who made New Game last year, which also had very attractive looking character designs and animation. The soundtrack was also pretty good, and held together pretty well, but is pretty forgettable aside from the opening and ending tracks which are fun and fit the theme of the show.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, Gabriel Dropout is a fun show with fun characters and I do recommend it to anyone looking for something easy and fun to each whilst delivering entertainment.<br />

Starting of the year 2017, we have Gabriel DropOut! A slice of life and comedy series about the everyday lives of 4 cute girls [Heaven and Hell] living in human world after graduating from their respective &#039;schools&#039;. There&#039;s a lot more SOL, CGDCT anime aired this season.<br />
<br />
Gabriel DropOut to me is quite interesting to watch. The core is much formulated, it can play off anime cliché as they use many frills moments to as the comedy theme, not by throwing it unnecessarily. Of course, it has a pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239617">
        doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off. Making the anime series, to be linear or in par with the manga I&#039;ve started reading before this series is even aired. A plus of it, would be the comedic scenes by the characters in the series.<br />
<br />
Animation wise, handled by Doga Kobo which their animations are nicely done and the use of manga iconography is there to express the characters emotions. Most of their background areas and the city scenes are the Doga Kobo standards, which I&#039;ve seen already a lot in which Doga Kobo produced such as Himouto Umaru Chan. Nevertheless, I still enjoy the series from Doga Kobo.<br />
<br />
The OP song by far is the best song for Winter 2017 in my perspective, due to it&#039;s vocals mixing both the angelic voice and heavy rock voice together which makes a fantastic OP song to hear, I&#039;ve would even repeat this song every time. Most of the OST songs are very decent and has a very quite familiar tone to that Umaru Chan, in which most of the staffs who produced this Anime is from Umaru chan.  Most of the seiyuus are pretty new, well we do have Hanazawa Kana who voiced Raphi. However, all the seiyuus are doing fantastically well in their debuts.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll talk more about the characters once I&#039;ve released the full review. However, SATANIA-CHAN IS THE BEST GIRL FTW!<br />
<br />
After the first four episodes were aired, I really enjoyed watching Gabriel DropOut not only due to having the same staff from Umaru Chan, but the comedies and the gags that this series had produced that made everyone laugh and making the series more enjoyable then ever. <br />
<br />
Nevertheless, enjoy watching Gabriel DropOut! I definitely would recommend this anime to those who are slice of life/CGDCT lovers out there.

    This anime is a waste of time . it is pretty much a rip-off of Himouto! Umaru-chan but with more annoying characters with bad personalities and cringy jokes. <br />
I won&#039;t lie, first it was enjoyable but then the repeated jokes every episode whether it&#039;s about the bullying satania joke, the dog stealing the bread, vigne acting like an angel or gab doing nothing other than playing video games. it got boring after a while.<br />
Even good characters (like vigne) turn into really annoying characters half-way through the series and I would say that Satania and Tapris were the only reasons I watched this series till the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243994">
        end. the interactions between characters aren&#039;t well-written and the side characters are pretty much useless and forgettable. <br />
To keep it short , I think watching this anime is a waste of time.

    Gabriel Dropout at first caught my attention due to me delving deeper into comedy and CGDCT (Cute girls doing cute things) animes. Having seen New Game! which is another offspring of the studio Doga Kobo,  gave me the feeling that this anime might also be promising, so I gave it a try. I am sorry to say I felt utterly let down even while not having many expectations.<br />
 <br />
Art &amp; Sound: <br />
The peculiar and noticable art of Doga Kobo is something I personally like due to the cutesy characters, its vividity and it doing a good job at conveying the emotions it wishes, so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review392014">
        artwise I can&#039;t really complain.<br />
Concerning the sound, the OP and ED were fitting, but I can&#039;t physically strain my brain enough to remember a moment where BGM would have been all that impactful, then again, this is a comedy so its not about impactfulness. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
This is where I felt like the anime was most lacking. In an anime where there is not much drama as driving force, or any particular action or event to further the story, the main source of laughs will usually be the interactions in between characters. We would be hoping that then at least the characters are made well, right? Well, normally ... <br />
In the case of Gabriel Dropout the characters felt very mundane, oft times annoying and worst of all, they all just assume a trope from the very beginning which won&#039;t change at all in the 12 episode run time of this season. Character development is not necessarily all that important, especially if we are talking about an episodical comedy such as this, but this is mainly true in case the characters are at least somewhat bearable. The MC, the eponymous Gabriel is just plain... annoying. Being given a glimpse of how she was not annoying before she turned into an otaku gave me a semblence of hope that there might be some development later, but I was just left blandly staring at an empty screen after the 12th episode. The only character I personally liked was Satania and she was just left as the punching bag for Gabriel and other characters of this series. I understand the whole &quot;manzai&quot;-ish relationship in between Gabriel and Satania but this fact doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s executed well, as it is just too over the top, to a limit where its painful to watch (unlike for example in Joshikousei no Mudazukai). The other characters are pretty bland honestly so I won&#039;t really dig into them.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: <br />
The first few episodes felt somewhat funny as I haven&#039;t gotten used to how reused the jokes are and I was personally hoping for some deviation in the character interactions. Hope dies last, or so the saying goes and that&#039;s essentially the only reason I finished this anime and so that it doesn&#039;t embellish my &quot;Dropped&quot; list further. <br />
<br />
Overall: <br />
I like the genres this anime works with, I just feel like this one wasn&#039;t executed well, thus leaving me with a bad taste in my mouth and a feeling of disappointment. However this just my opinion, I do encourage people to watch this to find it out for themselves, you might just enjoy it big time and well if you don&#039;t... at least it is a good kill time.    <br />
<br />
Anyhow if you have gotten this far I thank you for reading my first review! Wish you a good day.

    Gabriel DropOut is a series you will hear praises sung for due to its take on comedy and unabashedly moe characters as the angels and demons enter the human world and interact with each other with their role reversed personalities.<br />
It starts out fun but once it settles into a rhythm it refuses to let up to show even the slightest development in either story nor character.<br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
<br />
Gabriel is an angel that graduated at the top of her class in heaven and she and her classmates enter the human world to learn more about humans, while there she discovers MMO games and quickly becomes a lazy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309593">
        shut in that refuses to do her duties as an angel. She&#039;s accompanied by the role reversed cast of angels and demons and the series follows them around in their exploits.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
<br />
I really love Doga Kobo&#039;s work, and in terms of moe character designs it seems as if KyoAni and Doga Kobo will always pop up in the same sentence. They use bright distinct colors throughout giving the series its light tone, animation is always on point but not quite to the level of LoveLab despite airing several years after it, and the backgrounds are all nicely done. If you like anime simply for the art, Gabriel DropOut will never disappoint in that regard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
<br />
The VAs in Gabriel DropOut all do fine jobs delivering their lines to fit the moods and personalities of the characters, it never feels off and works throughout the series. The OP and ED are both well done and similarly entertaining.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character: 4/10<br />
<br />
The characters are the largest problem I have with Gabriel DropOut and are what make it suffer the most. The main cast consist of Gabriel, the game obsessed, lazy protagonist. She&#039;s accompanied by her polar opposite Vingette, a demon who&#039;s defining character traits are her upstanding morality and kindness. Raphiel, an angel that has become so bored with the human world that she&#039;s developed a craving for sadism. And Satanichia, best described as the devil may care punching bag of the series.<br />
<br />
Once you&#039;re introduced to these characters most of what you&#039;ll have to look forward to is Gabriel being lazy, Vingette being responsible, Raphiel finding ways to beat up on Satanichia, and Satanichia being cocky and being the punchline for most of the slapstick humor. The characters never develop or move beyond these defining traits so each episode will repeatedly play out these scenes. This gets tiresome and even though the characters are likable, they&#039;re entirely one dimensional and their interactions aren&#039;t enough to carry the series.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6/10<br />
Overall: 5/10<br />
<br />
As someone who loved Doga Kobo&#039;s work on Yuru Yuri and LoveLab, Gabriel DropOut comes off feeling as if the effort and care put into the latter two titles was missing from it. While it was mildly entertaining, I had a hard time enjoying it due to how stagnant it started to feel even before the halfway point of the series.

Story<br />
<br />
All of Heaven’s upcoming angels must take a period of study on Earth to live and learn among their mortal inferiors as requirement for advancement. Gabriel Tenma White, valedictorian of her graduating class, proves one of the most promising angels of the time, that is, until she became corrupted by human living. Thanks to the addicting nature of MMOs, she found herself drawn to lifestyle of a hikikomori, becoming what she proudly refers to as a ‘faillen angel’. Her friend, kindly demon Vignette Tsukinose April, does what she can to help Gabriel get on the right track, yet to no avail. With the sadistic Raphiel and delusional Satania along for the journey, these four supernatural teens come to learn the lines that separates angel, demon, and human are easily blurred.<br />
<br />
As we follow the daily lives of the four, the main attention point is how contrary they act to how you’d expect. Gabriel, an angel formerly top of her class, has devolved into an unreliable, lazy shut-in. Vignette, a demon straight from Hell, manages to be a responsible, caring, and otherwise altruistic friend. Raphiel is devilish in her own right, developing all sorts of pranks and such for Satania, self-proclaimed “future archdemon” and the one character who at least tries to act like she should, though usually to her own dismay (and our enjoyment). Scenes generally concern themselves with character interactions, and with the great characters that we receive, most of them are fun and generally humorous.<br />
<br />
Genre &amp; Characteristics<br />
<br />
While there’s a set lore in place, most of the series concerns itself with the daily events in the lives of the girls, effectively branding the anime a Slice of Life. Unfortunately, an issue that seems to place most in this genre is the very predictable episodic structure. As usual, yes there are holiday episodes, along with a beach journey earlier on. How badly (or positively?) the formulaic approach affects your experience will differ from person to person, and it’s not too big of a deal for me. There’s also a few fanservice-y scenes, though nothing too prevalent. Enough to please those who enjoy it and respect those that don’t.<br />
<br />
It’s a comedy anime, and I actually found it to be pretty hilarious at times. Comedy in Slice of Lives, particularly, are subjective, so not everyone is going to get the same enjoyment out of it. I can tell you that if you don’t think it’s funny, I wouldn’t bother watching, as that’s its primary selling point aside from character relationships. There are a few recurring gags that are generally funny and mostly revolve Satania getting screwed over, though at times they can get a bit repetitive.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, it would have been very easy for the creators to just add the fact there are “angels” and “demons” as a selling point, but I have to say the fact they weren’t humans really did help give the series more substance. A lot of the actions and dialogue relied on the interrelationships between angels and demons or those beings and humans, which in turn also helped support the comedy. In the latter half of the series, there were a couple episodes that involved the four returning to their respective realms in Heaven or Hell, presenting some really fun scenes from both zones.<br />
<br />
Worth mentioning too is that, perhaps as a complement to the rising trend of hikikomori in Japan, the main character exhibits many traits usually absent from a protagonist in her laziness, social withdrawal, and general apathy. With other protagonists similar to this in Kazuma Satou of Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! and Umaru Doma of Himouto! Umaru-chan, it’s becoming more prevalent that Japan is attracting this particular audience in their future creative works. If this is a sort of archetype you enjoy, you’ll find yourself pleased with Gabriel overall, but take note that she does take it a bit further and act like a bit of an asshole at times, explained better later on.<br />
<br />
Animation<br />
<br />
If you’re familiar with Himouto! Umaru-chan, you’ll come to find out the animation is strikingly similar, especially in terms of facial representation, background animation, and scenery. Both were animated by studio Doga Kobo, which I can say does a satisfactory job overall. Slice of Life anime rarely go above and beyond in terms of visual technique, but Gabriel DropOut performs well by enacting bright, exciting visuals with lively characters, however there are often cases of “resting same face” that don’t detract too heavily from its overall aesthetic. That being said, I always have a soft spot for when characters have striking color palettes, and each of the four girls have one, so good job.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I can’t say I was too impressed with the music. This is by no means saying it wasn’t acceptable, rather it’s that standard, generic Slice of Life soundtrack you’d expect to hear on almost any series within the genre. A few episodes had some good moments, notably those involving the coffee shop, but otherwise you won’t be looking to buy the discs.<br />
<br />
The seiyuu performed their roles very well, with no complaints with any performance. Two VAs did stand out well, particularly with Miyu Tomita nailing Gabriel’s monotone, even bored attitude and Naomi Oozora really seeming to understand the character of Satania, with her air of self-importance captured in detail.<br />
<br />
Despite the otherwise underwhelming soundtrack, I did enjoy both the opening and ending themes, both of which were performed by the characters themselves (always a welcome benefit).<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
As any good Slice of Life anime will require, the characters within Gabriel DropOut are unique, entertaining, and otherwise lovable. While Gabriel serves as the primary character, Vignette, Satania, and Raphiel receive ample amounts of attention, allowing fans of either or all to be pleased.<br />
<br />
Gabriel Tenma White, our titular “faillen angel”, has made radical changes since her visit to the human world. Thanks to the intoxicating nature of video games, she has forsaken any sort of altruistic goals her previous self may have set, focusing only on living her life as a hikikomori. Due to her apathetic nature, she often comes off as a bit of an asshole, though she does have her moments where she lets her true feelings for her friends pour out.<br />
<br />
Vignette Tsukinose April is perhaps the strongest character in her stability and attitude. She functions quite strongly as Gabriel’s foil, always trying to help her friend get focused back on her duties as an angel, though she herself seems to act the most angelic of the four. Despite this, she tries her hardest to prove she can be a true demon, but no one is really convinced.<br />
<br />
Satanichia Kurumizawa McDowell is easily the most enjoyable character of the series, and the one from whom much of the comedy originates. Though dim-witted and unintimidating, she has delusions of grandeur in that she will become the future archdemon of Hell. Originally the self-proclaimed rival of Gabriel, she comes to befriend the angel as she had no friends otherwise. There’s also a little doggo that comes and steals her melon bread at every opportunity, what a dick!<br />
<br />
Raphiel Ainsworth Shiraha is a sneaky little devil, no pun intended, and thrives in the misfortune of her companion, Satania. Large-busted and sadistic, a lot of the comedy also comes from Raphiel, as her pranks, not only on Satania but Vignette too.<br />
<br />
There are a few other characters introduced, including Tapris (Gabriel’s easily fooled kohai), Machiko (class president), and the unnamed coffee shop owner (Gabriel’s boss and coffee lover), though none of them have particularly large roles outside of being relevant to a given episode’s plot (or subplot).<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
<br />
Gabriel DropOut is best described as one of those series that doesn’t quite earn the sticking power of a great one but leaves you feeling satisfied and content with your time spent following its conclusion. Much of this is attributed to the fact that it felt very formulaic in its Slice of Life plot progression, though it performs well in offering four lovable characters whose interactions entertain you from episode to episode. These types of anime are not for everyone, and you can pretty much tell whether or not you’d enjoy it from a quick glance, but those that do will find themselves pleased with what’s offered.<br />

“Like,  humanity can just go to Hell and die for all I care.” – Gabriel

    If an angel came down to earth to live like a human being, what would they act like. What kind of lifestyle will they pursue? Well in this anime. It can go in many directions. Ladies and Gentlemen one of my personal favourite comedies, Gabriel DropOut.<br />
<br />
 I will be reviewing the episodes as an anime-only watcher.<br />
<br />
Story (9)<br />
Meet Gabriel, the oh so perfect angel that will solve all the problems. By the first couple of minutes we get to see what type of person Gabriel is. She is clean, calm, kind hearted, and &quot;perfect,&quot; She&#039;ll live a perfect and healthy life when she enters Earth. She

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239794">
        was able to do just that for a while...<br />
<br />
Until...She runs out of mana...Thus begins the real story of Gabriel DropOut<br />
<br />
Character (9)<br />
Probably one of the strongest points in this whole entire series. For what seemed to be a perfect angel known as Gabriel, she decided to take a 90, no 180, no, 270 degree turn and completely changed herself. She is no longer Gabriel, but now..gabriel (with a lowercase G if u haven&#039;t noticed). She is lazy, she doesn&#039;t care, she uses shortcuts, she is flat, and she is a hard gamer. Therefore she is the &quot;0 shits&quot; character of this anime.<br />
<br />
Vignette, probably the only character with common sense, and is not a complete well, dick? vagina? Let&#039;s just use mean fellah. Vignette keeps Gabriel in check, just remember, she is a demon. This demon is checking on the angel to make sure she doesn&#039;t do unnecessary acts to trouble her. Sounds just about right, right? Not right. A demon should not be the one watching her, more or less care about her actions. If anything, gabriel is the demon (since she does have a tainted halo) Vignette is more like an angel inside. When she tries to do evil acts, she does it in a way where it fails miserably, and makes it look damn adorable. Waifu Material? CHECK!<br />
<br />
Satania...Oh..poor Satania. Someone pls give her a hug. She will be the &quot;Punching Bag&quot; of this series. Satania is there for comic relief. She tries oh so hard to be evil, but it&#039;s too funny how stupid she tries. She&#039;s the character who you&#039;ll feel sorry for, but not sorry for, Because the amount of times people beat her, is to the point where you want to give her a nice hug. However I&#039;ve got to be honest though, Satania has it where it counts. She has that bod. The only one that can compare is...<br />
<br />
Raphiel. Raph is probably HanaKana&#039;s most evil character this season. Even though she only has 3 roles this season (Continuing 3-gatsu, and Rewrite) Raphiel, well, Is a scummy character. Not the bad kind of scum, but the scum that&#039;ll make you love her even more. She is a completely sadistic but majestic character. She probably beats Satania in terms of body structure by a TAD bit. Raphiel is the true demon of the series. She will do everything in her power to make sure you suffer a horrible death. To make your life miserable. She can do it, with words... But you know who can make Satania suffer even more?<br />
<br />
Dog. Dog is probably the best character in the show, his schemes are like no other. No one can match him, not even Raphiel. I dared to say that. The Dog and Satania have something, they share a certain bound. The master, and the slave, and I&#039;m sure you can guess which one is which.<br />
<br />
Art (10)<br />
Let&#039;s take a moment to appreciate yet another beautiful art style anime by Doga Kobo themselves. The character designs to the colour schemes, to the backgrounds, to the animation, to the attention in detail. It&#039;s got everything I wanted. It&#039;s a very colourful series that will give your eyes a nice rape. <br />
<br />
Sound (9)<br />
The voice acting, oh the voice acting. I need to meet them. They portray the emotion and personality of the character they play so well. Along with the OP and ED. With both of them being super catchy and something I would never skip. The way the music is done and the BGM during some of the scenes, that&#039;s what makes this anime so beautiful. Especially the sound effects gaw damn.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10)<br />
Maybe this type of comedy series isn&#039;t for you, and that&#039;s ok. Everyone has a preferred way of what type of comedy sparks their trigger. It can be dark humour, crazy humour, whatever. But for me, the amount of times I&#039;ve laughed and enjoyed Gabriel Dropout is beyond my own comprehension. To the characters, to the Music, to the Conversations, to the plot itself. This probably almost ties with Demi-chan for full enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Overall (9)<br />
I&#039;ve noticed that I&#039;ve put a lot of 9&#039;s in my reviews. Since they&#039;re so close at bringing in my full satisfaction, but just isn&#039;t quite there. This anime does seem to focus on four girls, which I&#039;m totally fine with. But this anime is for sure recommended for anyone who wants to:<br />
1. Laugh<br />
2. See someone bullied (in a comedic way of course)<br />
3. See some hot bods.<br />
4. Sit back and relax.<br />
<br />
Although sitting back and relaxing might be hard. Considering it had me rolling on the floor most of the time.<br />
<br />
BUT PLEASE tell me I wasn&#039;t the only one who really felt sorry for Satania when she got fukked by the door.<br />
<br />
At this current moment and time though. This is probably now my favourite comedy series, not just for this season. But favourite comedy series, ever.<br />
<br />
Gabriel DropOut was successful in making me pee myself each episode.<br />
Each episode was hilarious<br />
Each episode are full of great memories.<br />
Each episode takes your heart.<br />
<br />
And if you don&#039;t think this series is funny, then I don&#039;t know what comedy is anymore.<br />
<br />
Happy laughing!

    I&#039;m sure lots of people really like the CGDCT ( Cute girls doing cute things ) Genre, i personally really love it as it&#039;s always there to make you smile and get a Cuteness overload, it&#039;s a very great sub-genre, i thought i could give my opinion on a currently airing Anime that can be classified as one, it&#039;s called &#039;Gabriel dropout&#039; this show is simply CGDCT but with angels and demons, That doesn&#039;t make it any less cute though.this is my impressions/review on the first 5 episodes of the show.<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10,The story is pretty unique itself, a top-class angel Graduates and goes to earth

          <span style="display: none;" id="review241663">
        to complete her life but ends up discovering the internet,playing games,buying things online and transforming into a lazy Slob.<br />
<br />
Characters : 8/10, so far not many characters were introduced but all of them are unique in a way and very fun to watch those being<br />
Satania ,a demon who tries to be demonic but fails horribly<br />
Vignette, a demon who is too much of an angel<br />
gabriel, an angel that is not very angel-like.<br />
Raphiel, an angel that is a manipulator ( voiced by kana hanazawa=instant favorite )<br />
the characters could use more depth/backstory ( we already got some for how Vignette and gab are friends but we could use more )<br />
<br />
Art : 8/10,the art is done by the same studios as Umaru-chan and yuru yuri, so it&#039;s Really great in my opinion,but nothing fantastic.<br />
<br />
Sound : 8/10,the soundtracks so far are nothing special,but the voice acting especially raphiel and satania Are very very well done, the openings and endings also give me a Chuunibyou feel and they&#039;re Very catchy.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 9/10,as with every Moe anime done right,this show is very enjoyable and cute to watch, Kana hanazawa being one of my favorite VA&#039;s voicing one of my favorite characters in the show and overall everything being so Good and well done, i Highly enjoy this show, but that depends on what you like and dislike, if you&#039;re into cute things then go ahead and watch this,it also has a Chuunibyou demo koi ga shitai! feel to it,especially the op and ed.

    Angels and Demons living together...MASS HYSTERIA!...hysteria indeed.<br />
<br />
For a concept of angels being utter hellion demons to demons being the most angelic (or chunni) beings, put both of them together and see how they interact is a great premise and sure this comedy anime has it&#039;s share of problems but what makes this comedy anime stand out is it&#039;s characters...especially one that makes this anime all worth while.<br />
<br />
With Gabriel DropOut characters, we have...Gabriel Tenma White the titular character voiced by Miyu Tomita who was the best angel in heaven until MMORPG&#039;s corrupted her and she became a lazy NEET angel. Next is Vignette Tsukinose April voiced

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243741">
        by Saori Oonishi, a strict yet orderly demon and is the tsukommi to Gabriel&#039;s boke, but mostly tries to keep everyone in line. Raphiel Shiraha Ainsworth voiced by Kana Hanazawa is a caring angel but deep down is a masochist BUT towards Satania, she&#039;s an absolute sadist towards her, teasing to even putting Satania into paranoia levels whenever she&#039;s around. Lastly we have the aforementioned Sataniachia Kurumizawa McDowell voiced by Naomi Oozora...she&#039;s the BEST character in the series, not only for the aforementioned stuff she gets with Raphiel, but that she&#039;s one, a chunni demon who thinks she&#039;s a great demon by doing evil and horrible things...only for those acts she does to be absolutely petty and extremely minor cases of her chunni personality (as well as Raphiel misguidance) to make her an absolute riot the majority of the time. <br />
<br />
LA will say the obvious that this kind of setup is subjected to a huge case of running gag syndrome and yes LA will admit it does have it at times, Gabriel DropOut still uses it&#039;s running gags to it&#039;s advantage at times and thinks outside the box a la playing against the type even under different settings (with certain characters being put together alone etc.) A brilliant example is when Vignette tries to be more demonic, as a result she ends up like Satania instead. Other minor characters does come into the mix like Tapris voiced by Inori Minase and her being new to anything in the human world, Master voiced by Hideyui Umezu who misunderstands things from the main cast and Machiko the class president voiced by Mai Fuchigami being used by Gabriel for Gabriel&#039;s own benefits all used sparingly just to spice things up, mostly from Master and Iinchou who gets the most screentime, minor character wise. But even with it&#039;s running gags in place as well as playing against the type and adding characters here and there to spice things up, there is one unpredictability factor to Gabriel DropOut that makes this anime&#039;s comedy golden and that is Satania without a doubt, sure her running gag of always being the butt monkey of the group is a fact but it&#039;s her zany personality coupled with reactants of Gabriel, Vignette and Raphiel and her own misguidance makes the comedy unpredictable at times.<br />
<br />
If there were flaws LA would state to Gabriel DropOut is that for an anime called GABRIEL dropout, Gabriel herself isn&#039;t the driving factor to all this as Satania essentially stole the show from her and coupled with Gabriel lazy demeanor makes her more of an active spectator than a catalyst, though to LA&#039;s defence against this flaw, she does inadvertently gets into the action of certain skits as long as it benefits her like wanting food or money or wanting to see Satania suffer to the final arc concerning Gabriel&#039;s older sister Zelel voiced by MIYUKI SAWASHIRO with some varying degrees of success comedy wise. For LA, Gabriel&#039;s involvement with Satania&#039;s suffering to the final arc were decently to hilariously handled well albeit some few running gags that didn&#039;t annoy LA too much.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation by Doga Kobo, who is by now known for making cute moe comedies, makes another one expected of their moe prowess and the animation is overall decent and moe as usual. Best yet is how well they do their character expressions and isn&#039;t limited to make some outrageously funny expressions (be it evil lazy intent or chunni hubris). Backgrounding isn&#039;t the most notable thing in this anime as it is a character-centered comedy and all. Overall expected Doga Kobo animation, not that that&#039;s a bad thing.<br />
<br />
In terms of voice acting, the voice acting is excellent with some varying. Saori Oonishi is above average to say the least and she does have great timing and all, Miyu Tomita is great as well even if she is voicing a lazy character though with this role, LA can say that Miyu HAS RANGE, but on speaking of range, Naomi Oozora is LA&#039;s favourite voice actor in Gabriel DropOut, all due to her chunni vocal range and the fact that Naomi Oozora could be as hammy as she wanted to, likely allowing Naomi to have LOTS of fun with this character and in a ways Naomi Oozora&#039;s role as Satania kinda brought Naomi into LA&#039;s radar all because of Satania because of this. Now, as much as this isn&#039;t Kana Hanazawa&#039;s fault but LA thought that Kana Hanazawa wasn&#039;t just doing enough, she didn&#039;t do horrible or anything as she was just voicing another Kana Hanazawa character with a sadist streak. LA is merely saying this because Miyu Tomita, Saori Oonishi and Naomi Oozora seemed to do much better and put in more effort than Kana Hanazawa did and it&#039;s Kana Hanazawa!!!.<br />
<br />
Gabriel DropOut may have the same problems of having the running gags syndrome as well as main titular character who&#039;s less a catalyst to the comedy and more a reactant all due to her personality and everything, but Gabriel DropOut does have a silver demonic lining to all this, that being that Satania is such a saving grace (HA HA HA) and that the comedy has lots of unpredictability factors from it&#039;s settings to mixing characters together or just playing against the type from their running gags. Gabriel DropOut does have varying degrees of success but for LA, LA found the anime fun throughout and the comedy does tend to dip at times due to getting to cozy with it&#039;s running gags but with Satania REALLY being the saving grace and some genuinely unpredictability makes this anime&#039;s comedy great. <br />
<br />
Gabriel DropOut is a great comedy anime with angels and demons who are quite the opposite to say the least. Gabriel DropOut is probably LA&#039;s 3rd favourite anime comedy for Winter 2017 and with such great comedies coming out from Winter 2017, Gabriel DropOut had a strong competition to contend with, but nonetheless Gabriel DropOut DIDN&#039;T &quot;DROP&quot; away from one of LA&#039;s favourite comedies for Winter 2017, that&#039;s for sure.

    Gabriel DropOut has an interesting premise and does an ok job to compete on the moe comedy genre. However the noteworth good observations stops there.<br />
<br />
Story 4/10<br />
The peak of the comedic value is around ep.4, while the first 3 will either infuriate you or just be boring, and the rest of the series continues in a spiral of increasing levels of boring.<br />
<br />
Characters 3/10<br />
Opening plot introduces Gabriel, a once righteous angel who turns into a lazy slob after discovering video games on Earth where she is attending high school. Then we are slowly introduced to the rest of the cast. Oh the rest of the cast... probably

          <span style="display: none;" id="review245971">
        the most stereotypical characters (except for 1, which has a few more interesting qualities)<br />
<br />
To sum up, we have an angel bully who picks on a thickhead demon loner, a demon who is more angelic than all the other angels combined, an angel that does absolutely nothing useful, and a bunch of side characters that are not really developed.<br />
<br />
Art 7/10<br />
You can&#039;t really go wrong with the moe art style, especially with an experienced studio<br />
<br />
Sound 6/10<br />
OP and ED songs were good, arguably better than the contents in-between<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 3/10<br />
Peaked around the 4th episode, then it was just boring, boring, boring.<br />
<br />
Overall 4/10<br />
The premise was good, the execution was terrible and the comedy was tolerable at best.

    While I was looking for anime to binge watch for my summer break, I stumbled upon this show. When I first read the synopsis, I didn&#039;t expect much at all. It only looked like a comedy anime that revolved around cute girls doing cute things. However, I ended up watching Gabriel Dropout anyway since I had nothing else to do. That was a decision I don&#039;t regret making.<br />
<br />
Story - 6<br />
Well, the thing is, there is no actual story. <br />
In the first episode, we are to introduced to the main character, Gabriel, who is graduating to become a full-fledged angel, and is apparently the top angel

          <span style="display: none;" id="review253647">
        in their class. As a final test for all the future angels, they are to attend high school in the human world to closely observe humans. Many people placed their hopes and trust in Gabriel, telling her that they knew that she was going to go far and achieve a lot of heavenly things.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Gabriel arrives at Earth as an angel in disguise, but when she gets exposed to the human entertainment that is video games, her personality does a full 180° turn. Instead of helping people out, she now spends her time locked up in her apartment playing video games. Instead of calling herself an angel, she now calls herself a &quot;faillen&quot; angel.<br />
<br />
The anime tells the story of the wacky things that happens to Gabriel and her just as wacky companions in their everyday lives.<br />
<br />
Art - 7<br />
There&#039;s nothing special or unique about the art and animation in this anime, in my opinion. I mean, I haven&#039;t really seen anything amazing from Doga Kobo, the animation studio for this, yet. We&#039;ve seen something like this before, so there really isn&#039;t anything to gush about. Although, it does successfully manage to set the tone for the show and deliver the message, &quot;this is a comedy anime!&quot; to the viewers loud and clear. The art and animation does its job, and that&#039;s most important.<br />
<br />
Sound - 8<br />
To be honest with you all, the only music I really paid attention to was the OP. I thought it was extremely charming in its own way. Go on and give the OP song a listen. What do you think about it? Yes, it&#039;s energetic. Yes, it&#039;s loud. But more importantly than that, it sounds like everyone singing is just having tons of fun. Heck, the lyrics make it seem like they aren&#039;t even singing at all! Read the English translation, it sounds like the four main characters are just having a normal conversation with each other. Honestly, I think this is genius and amazing. Sure, this may not be the first anime song to do this, but I really liked how did it in this OP.<br />
<br />
The voice acting is great, really. A huge part of why the comedy works is the excellent voice acting. If it weren&#039;t for that, then I think that the comedy wouldn&#039;t have such a strong effect.<br />
<br />
Characters - 9<br />
The four main characters: Gabriel,Vigne, Raphiel, and Satania, are extremely lovable and really naturally funny.<br />
<br />
You have Gabriel, the shut-in angel turned into &quot;faillen&quot; angel. Vigne, the demon in training that is more angelic than demonic. Raphiel, the angel who makes questionable decisions when it comes to having fun (most of which involve a certain &quot;archdemon&quot;). And Satania, the archdemon who is just a total airhead. <br />
<br />
There isn&#039;t a single dull moment when these 4 are at the same place at the same time. The way they interact with each other is really entertaining, and, of course, funny. Call me immature if you don&#039;t appreciate this kind of humor, but I found everything really funny. I would constantly just smile and laugh like an idiot during every single episode.<br />
<br />
Personal enjoyment - 10<br />
I absolutely loved every single second I spent watching this show. All the jokes had me laughing out loud at every moment. I wish the anime never ended, sigh.<br />
<br />
Overall - 9<br />
If you&#039;re looking for a chill comedy anime to watch, then I recommend this show. You might like it, or you might not like it. It depends if the humor in this show is the kind of humor you actually like. It&#039;s a hit or miss kind of situation, really. I know people who thought the humor was too immature for their tastes. I just so happened to be the type who likes this kind of comedy. So, if you&#039;re anything like me, then you&#039;re sure to love this show just as much or even more than I do.

    Gabriel Dropout is a moe comedy that executes its jokes quite well. I&#039;d say it&#039;s certainly earned its position as one of the best in this genre.<br />
<br />
The general premise is that demons and angels are sent to earth to go to school. This anime creates plenty of comedy by role reversing the characters. Gabriel starts out as one of the best angels but discovers MMOs and becomes a shut-in. Vigne is a devil but she is so well behaved and preppy that everyone&#039;s always commenting on how she&#039;s not a very good demon. And so-on.<br />
<br />
The characters are quite memorable. I liked Satania&#039;s gimmick of being

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309845">
        a tryhard demon that is always making mistakes and being the butt of jokes. This is a character-driven comedy and what it lacks in plot progression it makes up for in fleshing out the characters. It&#039;s more or less a slice of life comedy.<br />
<br />
Art and sound is good. The voice acting is great. Doga Kobo has a signature art style that looks very &#039;clean&#039; and I prefer it to many other studios&#039; art styles.<br />
<br />
For a moe anime it has some surprisingly mature themes and jokes, but don&#039;t let that scare you off. <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t think of many things to criticize about this anime. If you want a cute comedy with some memorable, funny characters and good joke writing you can&#039;t go wrong with Gabriel Dropout. I give it a solid 9.

    Gabriel Dropout is a hilarious anime that didn&#039;t disappoint my expectations at all. [Minor Spoilers]<br />
<br />
STORY: 8/10<br />
The story follows Gabriel as she settles on Earth and each transforms in her own unique way. She becomes sentient to her own angelic kind and fully indulges in the guilty pleasures of human life (and laziness). Her friends aren&#039;t much better despite differing from each other. Their escapades are hilarious to watch and their interactions even more so. Their friendships click without the viewer even noticing and before they know it the characters are already heavily invested in each other.<br />
<br />
The comedy is golden with its fair share of running

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307884">
        gags and hilarious moments. Much of why these moments are hilarious I&#039;ll explain in the next section, but I can easily say that the show does a great job in keeping the each story consistently interesting and enjoyable.  Even the climax at the end of the series was being slowly built up to showing a bit of structure in what should&#039;ve been a Slice of Life anime.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: 8/10<br />
The 4 main characters all have their ups and downs that add to the utter nonsense that occurs in each episode. Their personalities intertwining with each other makes for funny scenarios and also allow the viewer to understand them better all the while. The characters are easy to relate to much of the time and funny to watch as they struggle with what they were created as.<br />
<br />
Gabriel: The main character of the series. Almost immediately there is already irony in her story of how she changed from a pious angel to basically a demon. Her lifestyle on Earth differs greatly from how she acted prior to moving there, and her personality changes as much as the way she lives does, too. She doesn&#039;t care at all for her past self and easily invests her time in lazing around and basically becoming an otaku. Her motivations that rarely spark her interest in other things, such as her rivalry with Satania, allows us to see how capable she is using her talents (and even more clearly her choice not to use them). Her main struggle is living up to her same standards of her past self when she has to. This creates many fun situations such as her return home or when the end comes. Overall she&#039;s a great main character to watch and fun to watch as she tries to make a living with her flawed lifestyle.<br />
<br />
Vignette: Vignette&#039;s role as a demon is quite unfortunate when compared to her personality. She&#039;s everything that Gabriel was before Gab turned into a shut-in, and she cares so much about doing good for everyone. This is ironic as she is supposed to be causing harm for humans rather than trying her best to care for everyone she meets, which she finds herself doing instead. Her payments from Hell are literally going down because of how kind she is. This alone is hilarious, and it becomes even more so when she has to take care of Gabriel. They&#039;ve basically swapped roles as this introduces how the angels are truly demons and vice-versa. Many things challenge Vignette to become more of a demon (like the check for instance) and watching her fail to change her good ways is just too funny to watch.<br />
<br />
Raphiel: Raphiel&#039;s angelic ways are as flawed as Gabriel&#039;s. The issue is that Raph has always been that way whereas Gab transformed into her current self. Raphiel is a bully who loves setting up situations that will bring herself pleasure. This sadist is an angel that basically ruins the life of a demon instead of the other way around. A lot of what she does is hilarious, especially when combined with Satania&#039;s personality. Just as Gabriel is basically a demon, Raphiel is a demon taking on the guise as an angel. What&#039;s even worse is how she acts the way she should do qualify as an angel in front of others, but when messing with her friends she&#039;s almost as bad as it gets.<br />
<br />
Satania: The absolutely gullible and retarded demon in this series. She tries extremely hard to fit her role- harder than the rest of the cast does- and gets repaid with absolutely nothing. This is part in thanks to her naivety as she believes things too easily and ends up doing the most petty of things. She is the epitome of running gags in this series; the dog stealing her melon bread and her high and mighty personality are all victims of this gag setup. This is for the better, however, as it leads her to doing stupid things and creating funny situations that otherwise wouldn&#039;t happen. When combined with Raphiel&#039;s cunning, this is pushed even further as she falls right into every trap set out for her throughout the series. <br />
<br />
ART: 8/10<br />
The art for this series is very cute and straightforward. Doga Kobo is great with special effects (Plastic Memories is a great example of this) and they didn&#039;t fall short of this at all in this anime. The particle effects and scenery were highlighted in the Heaven and Hell scenes of the anime. Overall the art was really good and nothing bugs me in any way with the art.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 7/10<br />
The soundtrack is really basic highschool anime music. However, what carries this anime&#039;s sound would have to be the OP and ED. Both are extremely catchy and upbeat which is perfect for this series. These were really great to listen to and I found myself not skipping these while binging the series. <br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 9/10<br />
This anime was downright hilarious. Every episode I choked in laughter about all the events I found the characters in. It was a great comedy anime and definitely in my favorite comedies.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 8/10<br />
This series did a great job as a comedy anime by entertaining me and making me laugh a lot. It also easily attracted me to the specials that I realized existed later on and has me waiting for more content. The characters are all lovable and are even more lovable when interacting with each other. I enjoyed this anime thoroughly and believe that it was a great comedy.<br />

    At first I was real hype to finally sit down and watch it. Expecting it to be super amazing. While it was a good anime overall, there are a few problems here and there. Might be from me watching a ton of these shows, which in turn has made me used to these kinds of shows, and how the pacing goes. So instead of it being super impactful, it&#039;s less impactful in my book.<br />
<br />
Not that Gabriel DropOut is a bad show in any stretch. The characters are charming and great. Giving us a different look at how angels and demons are, along with that not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321793">
        all are as described in that &#039;angels are nice holy beings&#039; and &#039;demons are nothing but pure evil.&#039; As the anime shows not either are all like that. Which I find interesting and a nice touch. <br />
<br />
The story is great to. It makes me wonder if they go somewhere else when it comes to going to school to study. So overall Gabriel DropOut despite it&#039;s repetitive themes. It still comes off as a great show that would be a good watch! So you should give it a shot if you haven&#039;t!
