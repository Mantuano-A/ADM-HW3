    Dissapointed that nobody has written a review on such a wonderful heart warming anime so I guess I&#039;ll do the honors.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll first do recommendation for those who are too busy to read all of a review. I recommend this anime for everyone who wants to watch something touching. Not really a romance, its more of a slice of life anime that should be able to find itself on everybody&#039;s list. Its an anime without grand events or drastic plot turns, its just goodness that keeps on going.<br />
<br />
Story:10/10!<br />
The story starts right away and right away and right away you get caught by the cuteness of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review244">
        plot(and the cuteness of yuzuyu chan). Like many other anime&#039;s, every episode of this anime will feature a story that will throw the main character, Kippie, into a situation where he will have to expand himself. These situations are things that could/would occur in real life and really reaches out to the watcher. What makes the story line great, however, is that unlike many &amp;amp;quot;good story line&amp;amp;quot; anime&#039;s, each episode illustrates masterfully the development of the characters and their relationships. Nothing is gone to waste in the story and you never get the feeling that some episodes are stand alone. The episode don&#039;t feel like they are just reusing the formula for previous episodes. Personally, I really got drawn into the story line and just couldn&#039;t stop watching and seeing how things would unravel, how the characters will develope and eventually how the story would end.<br />
<br />
Animation: 8/10<br />
I would say that the animation is not the strong suit of this anime, but by no means is it shabby. There is very little &amp;amp;quot;action&amp;amp;quot; in terms of fight scenes(0), magical transformations(0), special character abilities(0) etc so I guess you could say that the animation is a little flimsy on special effects. Everything is drawn very clean in this anime. The characters have a lot of visual appeal, with the style being similar to &amp;amp;quot;Bokura ga ita&amp;amp;quot; if you have seen that anime. In the end, the animation will never make you say &amp;amp;quot;wow&amp;amp;quot; but thats just right because the focus is on the story line and character development.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
Like the animation, the in anime sound track is very simple. I hardly noticed it while watching it. Music is used very liberally but enhances certain scenes. The voice actresses/actors? for Yuzuyu and Kokoro were perfect in my opinion and made the anime that much better. The main reason I gave sound a 9 is because of the opening intro song. Titled &amp;amp;quot;Sunny Side Up&amp;amp;quot; it is one of the best opening songs I have heard. I never, ever, fast fowarded past it and listening to it gave me feelings akin to the opening song of Fruits Baskets. <br />
<br />
Character:10/10!<br />
Another strong suit of Aishiteruze Baby, the three main characters involved are all characters that you can root for and most importantly beleivable. There are many anime&#039;s that try to oversell certain characteristics of characters just to make them &amp;amp;quot;defining&amp;amp;quot;, sometimes almost to the point of overkill but there is nothing like that in Aishiteruze. The characters were just great! I don&#039;t want to spoil anything for anybody but I just wanted to add that Kokoro is, I think, the only main female character that I haven&#039;t found annoying in some aspect. Her character plays her personality very well and everything is fitting. Definently not some simple female character with some haunted past or one dimensional issue that in a big turn of events get solved and falls head over heels for the main male character.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:10/10 =)<br />
I really, really enjoyed this anime. Its a type of anime that you can just watch at anytime and in any mood. It should cheer you up! Its a pity that more people haven&#039;t watched this anime so hopefully this review can change that.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
<br />
Not much else to say, go watch it!

    Kippei, an highschool goofy kid who spends most time slacking out and flirting with girls suddenly is entrusted with a 5 year old kid to take care of. This setup evolves into an incredibly heart warming story to cherish and rejoice, dealing with everyday problems of raising a child and struggling with his own carelessness and ineptitude Kippey becomes attached to yuzuyu quickly and tries his best to make her happy. Dealing with a child everyday brings many worries and consumes most of his time but also makes him grow into a mature responsible person. <br />
<br />
The innocence of a child and how they perceive the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1042">
        daily events creates an amazing charisma towards this relation, dramatic scenes further enhances the feelings creating an intricate empathy towards the situation and drawing the viewer into it. Further along theres a touch of romance that fits perfectly as a symbiotic situation to the main plot. The main female characters (yuzuyu and Kokoro) are just overflowing with cuteness, their sad hearts makes you want to comfort them understanding perfectly how kippey matures for the sake of them.<br />
<br />
Technically the characters have a particular drawing style in which the drawings and animation are watchable but not on par with the latest animes. I enjoyed personally some still shots on key moments that portrays how a sweet memory is engraved into the mind in my opinion. The sound is rarely noticeable but the opening theme shines and will stick in your mind every episode soothing the mood. The voice acting is quite good, the kids were very well acted and I don&#039;t have any complaints on the rest.<br />
<br />
A beautiful story everyone should see. Heartwarming, and sad for moments, feels good to watch even by the second or third time and guaranteed to move your heart.

    No action... No blood... No ecchi or fanservice... No politics... No mystery... How could this anime expect to get anywhere? What could it possibly offer? Mark it as a huge failure and move on right?<br />
<br />
If anyone reading this were to do that you would be making a huge mistake. All this anime needs is the smile of a heartbroken child to wholly capture you and take you on an amazing journey. I don&#039;t care how bloody or epic you like your average anime to be, if you are honest to yourself, and at least partially human, you will be touched by Aishiteruze Baby. Give it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14287">
        a chance.<br />
<br />
Story - 10<br />
<br />
From the first episode it is clear exactly how the story is meant to play out, and true to your hopes, it does. A sweet and touching story that grabs a hold of your heartstrings from the first time you see Yuzuyu, and doesn&#039;t let them go until long after you&#039;ve finished the anime. It deals in some pretty mature themes, with stalkers, abusers, and the emotional traumas faced by an innocent and charming child abandoned by her mother. Don&#039;t expect anything to get your adrenaline pumping from sheer awesomeness. It isn&#039;t that kind of story. It&#039;s strength is subtle.<br />
<br />
Art - 8<br />
<br />
Unsurprisingly, the art isn&#039;t the strong point of Aishiteruze Baby. The style of character art is great, Kokoro being one of the most attractive females I&#039;ve ever seen in an anime. The fact that a lot of the characters look markedly similar, maybe even to the point of confusion, brings its grade down.<br />
<br />
Sound - 8<br />
<br />
The OP is beautiful, and character voices are great. Little if any sound effects but this isn&#039;t really an anime that needs them. Yuzuyu&#039;s voice in particular is often extremely cute and not in an annoying fashion, but there are some rare instances where it sounds false.<br />
<br />
Character - 10<br />
<br />
Aishiteruze Baby&#039;s strongest point are the characters in it. You will believe that each character is based off of someone in real life, there isn&#039;t one cookie cutter character in the entire lot. Yuzuyu is the cutest toddler ever, Kippei is the kind of guy that most men would want to be like. Kokoro is in a league of her own. I have seen well over a hundred animes by now and Kokoro is the only character i&#039;ve fallen in love with. Of course this particular opinion is definately preference based. Some guys might find the silent, outwardly strong, but inwardly wanting protection characteristics of Kokoro to be unattractive. There are some weird people out there...<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 10<br />
<br />
Well the happy glow that comes with a good story and great characters is definately here. Smile, wipe away the few soft tears that sneak out, and imagine for a little while the way the rest of the story could have played out. Ah yes that was good.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall - 10<br />
<br />

    I am very glad that it&amp;rsquo;s not Aishiteruze BABY (and when I say baby, I mean underage people). I thought it was going to be an extreme, lolicon anime. Seeing how Kippei was so nervous about Yuzuyu sleeping in his bed at the first episode made me a bit nervous.<br />
<br />
Turns out it was a cutesy story about a reformed playboy (well, sort of) becoming the surrogate mother for his adorable, 5 year old cousin. It&amp;rsquo;s not as easy as it seems - Kippei had to deal with a psychotic secret admirer, Yuzuyu&amp;rsquo;s countless longings for her mother, a physically beaten child, etc.Plus there was also

          <span style="display: none;" id="review378">
        a love story in the forms, and thank God, it&amp;rsquo;s not one between Kippei and Yuzuyu. It&amp;rsquo;s with one of the popular girls in Kippei&amp;rsquo;s school, Kokoro.<br />
<br />
I got a feeling that this anime is very popular among Japanese high school girls, or teenage girls in general. They can immerse themselves in watching Kippei&amp;rsquo;s love story evolve, and if they&amp;rsquo;re not satisfied with just that, there&amp;rsquo;s always the adorable Yuzuyu. I&amp;rsquo;m a bit disappointed about the ending though, but I guess it&amp;rsquo;s a win-win situation for all of the characters.<br />
<br />
I only liked Kippei and Yuzuyu, because everyone else seemed so cold and mean. Kokoro barely showed any emotion, and even though she knows that herself she hasn&amp;rsquo;t really changed much. Reiko (Kippei&amp;rsquo;s older sister) was always so mean, Satsuki (Kippei&amp;rsquo;s younger brother) was almost unnoticed, along with the rest of the cast. Other than the two main characters, I also like Marika. I didn&amp;rsquo;t like Marika at first, since I thought that for a 5 year old, she sure was bitchy, but she&amp;rsquo;s actually a tsundere girl. I&amp;rsquo;m glad she was able to make friends with Yuzuyu.<br />
<br />
The character I liked the least would be Yuzuyu&amp;rsquo;s mom. Why would you leave your 5 year old daughter on her own? I know she&amp;rsquo;s trying her best to be strong and find a way to take care of Yuzuyu, but isn&amp;rsquo;t she just being selfish? If she really wanted to take care of Yuzuyu, she should&amp;rsquo;ve stayed by her side. I&amp;rsquo;m sure Yuzuyu&amp;rsquo;s also sad about her dad dying.<br />
<br />
While I&amp;rsquo;m not a huge fan of the art and animation, I got a feeling that teenage girls will think otherwise. The clothes Kippei, Yuzu, Kokoro and Miki would wear are really cute and I think this is what they wear in Japan right now too. Anyway, the reason why I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the art and animation too much is that it&amp;rsquo;s inconsistent. The characters&amp;rsquo; appearances change almost every episode. Even Yuzuyu&amp;rsquo;s toys (the bunny and the bear) look different every time she plays with them &amp;ndash; that is, unless she really has different bunny and bear stuff toys. The CG was also of low quality. Maybe they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have used CG at all and went with hand drawn all throughout.<br />
<br />
Voice acting was a bit off. It didn&amp;rsquo;t sound like voice acting in other anime series before, and I was thinking if this is how they speak in Japan. Only Kippei and Yuzuyu spoke with emotion, while the rest (specially Kokoro) were bland. I love Yuzuyu&amp;rsquo;s seiyuu. Her voice is so adorable, and turns out her seiyuu (Miyu Tsuzurahara) is actually a child. I don&amp;rsquo;t think an adult seiyuu would be able to pull it off, even if she&amp;rsquo;s really good.<br />
<br />
There was nothing special about the music. It didn&amp;rsquo;t need my attention that much. The opening theme was OK, but I don&amp;rsquo;t get the part with the &amp;ldquo;macaroni&amp;rdquo;. The ending song on the other hand sounded a bit old, and it didn&amp;rsquo;t really fit the series at all, since as I&amp;rsquo;ve said, the plot is definitely for a younger audience.<br />
<br />
After watching the ending, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but ask for a second season. Even if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really impressed, I still want to see more of the story.

    This is a beautiful story, a touching and heartfelt shoujo drama. Its about a popular high-school playboy who finds himself the surrogate parent of his 5-year-old niece, Yuzuyu. The emotions invoked in this anime are on par with emotions I felt when I first watched Fruits basket except this is more slice-of-life than fantasy feel. The art is pretty good and the relationship between Kippei and his niece is extremely sweet. Yuzuyu herself is so cute you want hug her and never let go. It&#039;s a series that is really cute without being sugary sweet. I would recommend it any age group or gender.

    Aishiteruze Baby was one bumpy ride just as the summary suggests. Kippei was a horrible playboy who doesn&#039;t show any signs of character change until he falls in love with Kokoro (The person not a heart..) <br />
Yuzuyu is a sad, cute kindergartener and it was pretty interesting to see how Kippei gets along with her. Overall, it took a lot of patience and time to finish this anime. If you like babies, throw up, playboys, kisses, and bentoes, then this anime is for you!

    A supposed &quot;hidden gem&quot; that should have just been left in the dirt.<br />
<br />
To begin with, I want to give my overall opinion on Aishiteruze Baby, before I explain it. I thought the show was fun to watch and had several moments that were decent and was an overall okay anime to watch. But after the extremely anti-climatic ending, it honestly felt like I should&#039;ve just watched another anime instead.<br />
<br />
Story: 4<br />
The story follows the playboy protagonist Kippei who is free from responsibility and living out his high-school days as most of us would have liked. Well, screw you, Kippei! Because your cousin in pre-school Yuzuyu has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346903">
        just arrived and your entire family is shifting responsibility and supervision of her onto you! Kippei has had minor character development as soon as we reached the ending, and it felt like the whole story wasn&#039;t resolved by ironically having much better side stories than the main one. Boom, love interest arrives, and thats the monotone Kokoro. But she doesn&#039;t really matter, so moving onto art. <br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
Aishiture Baby was first streamed in 2004, and considering today&#039;s standards; the anime has aged pretty well. The animation wasn&#039;t exactly perfect, but it was alright and at least I was able to watch it without having to take a Xanax.<br />
<br />
Sound: 4<br />
 My god! The opening was atrocious, and in every anime that I watch, I always watch the opening before the episode, except for Aishiteruze Baby. The voice acting was rather decent for Kippei, and the VA rather matches the character. However, for the other two protagonists Kokoro and Yuzuyu, their voices, not so good. Yuzuyu wasn&#039;t terrible, but it was also not that good; whenever she cried it was absolutely deafening! Please stop! And for Kokoro, she was simply monotone. Yeah, just monotone. When we get a glimpse of her character, it sort of makes sense, but Kokoro should have been a bit more energetic towards the end, rather than simply, monotone.<br />
<br />
Character: 3<br />
Clearly, the characters are the weak point of the show. Kippei hasn&#039;t exactly developed towards the end; he&#039;s now just slightly less of a playboy who also has some responsibility. Yuzuyu was not as bad as I had expected; she was portrayed as a child a little bit better than other anime, with her being much more sensitive to the world and looking to make ends with her past. Kokoro has had her share of an unfair past, explaining her lack of personality and rather lifeless character. I did not like Kokoro at all; her lack of personality was detrimental to her character, and rather than being someone who we should root for, she just falls as a second, less likeable Kippei. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7<br />
Yeah, I enjoyed the anime much more than I had expected considering its many flaws, but I&#039;m not quite sure if that was because of the anime&#039;s fun or simply because of how much I made fun of it. I liked the side stories so much more than the main story, because of the rather realistic scenarios that have a lot more depth.  <br />
<br />
Overall: 5<br />
Personally, I would only recommend this anime to people who aren&#039;t looking for 10/10 quality and just want a quick laugh not paying much attention to the story. There are some themes that are rather dark, which is pretty ironic because of how the anime comes forth as fun and mellow. The side stories, like I said, had themes that you would absolutely not expect from other anime and especially ones of this genre. As a final goodbye, I do not recommend this anime to anyone, but if you&#039;re feeling saucy, then go for it. <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading!!

    Never judge a book by its cover or an anime by the first few minutes of watching it. I almost gave this series a miss as I started watching it on a whim. Soon, I badly wanted to know the ending. A great heartwarming series.<br />
<br />
Plot wise, it follows the life of the lazy male protagonist, Kippei, who slowly grows up when he&#039;s saddled with the care of his abandoned 5-year old cousin, Yuzuyu. The series follows the heartwarming interactions of Kippei and Yuzuyu while they live their lives together. It also manages to explore the various social problems faced by families nowadays, which I find

          <span style="display: none;" id="review11900">
        was nicely done as it does not leave me feeling too depressed.<br />
<br />
The artwork of most of the characters aren&#039;t really to my liking but Yuzuyu would give Chiyo (Azumanga Daioh) a run for her money in terms of cuteness. The art for the backgrounds suits the feeling for this kind of an anime, so it wasn&#039;t that bad.<br />
<br />
Sound wise, it&#039;s great. The theme songs fit the mood of the series and the background music also enhances the scenes in the anime. The voices for the characters fits well in my opinion and I have no grouses on it.<br />
<br />
The characters are believable. Yuzuya doesn&#039;t feel too mature for a kid who is living without her mother. She still breaks down once in a while. As for the male protagonist and the other supporting characters, their behavior does not change drastically. Kippei, who in the first episode we see as lazy, is still lazy throughout the anime but less so.<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed the anime and I&#039;m now looking for the translated manga to read. If you like heartwarming or romance dramas, give this series a try.

    Story: The story for this is fairly original. The first half is extremely extremely extremely boring but after about episode 15 the story takes a drastic turn. It gets really good! What&#039;s very interesting about the storyline is that there are a bunch of subplots that don&#039;t move the main storyline along. They are basically filler subplots. But the subplots are the best part of the story! They&#039;re sooo much better than the main plot. Without the subplots this show would be super boring. The reason that the story is only getting a 6/10 is because the ending is pretty disappointing. The main conflict barely

          <span style="display: none;" id="review16751">
        gets a resolution. It has a cliffhanger ending, but it&#039;s a small cliffhanger.<br />
<br />
Art: This probably has some of the worst art that I have ever seen. It looks as if they tried to make the big eyes on all the characters work, but it just is an epic fail. The only character to pull it off is Yuzuyu. The colors are also not very enjoyable to look at for long periods of time. The animation has flaws everywhere and definitely could be improved. The animation in the opening theme also made me drop the series before I even saw the actual animation of the anime.<br />
<br />
Sound: The opening and ending themes are really beautiful and really helped bring the sound rating up. The background score was highly disappointing. Featuring mostly midi-type songs you would found in an old Pokemon video game, it&#039;s really bad. There are some really pretty piano/violin tracks though. The vocal cast could use a lot of work. Some of the characters sound robotic and like they are reading the script for the first time. The voices of some aren&#039;t very enjoyable to listen to either. But Yuzuyu&#039;s voice actress was able to pull off the tone of a four-year-old really well.<br />
<br />
Character: The main character, Kippei, is the average guy who thinks all the girls like him. It&#039;s nice to see his character change over the course of the series by spending so much time with Yuzuyu. Yuzuyu is probably one of the easiest characters to like in this series. Kokoro on the other hand, is probably one of the hardest. She gives out mixed signals all the time and she can get rather annoying.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Although the first half of the series was torture to get through, the second half get me interested for most of it. Really good and if you have the patience to get through the first 14 episodes, you will find a series that was well worth your time.<br />
<br />
Overall: If you need an anime with superb art, an amazing score, and every character is likeable then this anime is not for you. If you want an anime with a story that will make you laugh and even make you cry at some points, then this is the anime for you!

    Like everyone else watching this anime, i was really not sure what to expect going in, a highschool playboy raising a child, what but problems could follow. but from the first episode i was hooked. I found myself wanting to watch the next episode just because the main characters were nice and genuine, very calming to watch, more relatable then your standard character. it is a wonderful story, the progression was nice and the fact that while there is minor drama but its not so extreme that you want to bang your head on the wall because someone&#039;s an idiot like others have in them.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review74471">
        it never stretched an arc watering down the story and stayed true to the main story.  Each episode left you smiling. The ending while maybe leaving a couple things undone left, was very satisfying and nice to see, it left you being able to picture very easily how their future would unfold.<br />

    Well when I saw the display picture and the english name &quot;I love you baby&quot; I thought that this is going to be kinda cheesy and i was planning to drop it after first episode,  but when I tried and started watching this  I immediately fell in love with it (this is base on my opinion so please don&#039;t take it too seriously). for me, the characters were well drawn and the plot was quite normal but amazingly presented. There are so many &quot;aww&quot; and &quot;heart-beating&quot; moments. It is just so adorable how the main character highschool boy take cares of his five

The art may not be the very best but it is watchable and can make you feel like they are real people.<br />
<br />
I highly recommend this anime because for &quot;me&quot; this is really worth watching.

    After watching this anime I decided to write my very first review, if my review is a bit off or you have any comments (bad and good) please let me know<br />
<br />
To start off i will have to say that this is a very heartwarming anime to watch because it is just so easy to watch.<br />
<br />
Let’s start with the story. The story of the Aishiteruze Baby really lets you really understand the feeling and the mind of a 5 year old girl. The story is so well written that there are times in the anime when i wonder how the story will move on from that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23580">
        point. The anime really play it slow with the story which i think is good since it is supposed to be a light- romantic comedy. The story mainly revolves around the relationship of 3 people; Kippei, Yuzuyu and Kokoro in their struggle with life. That s all i can say without any spoilers :)<br />
<br />
The art is great i love the art of this anime especially how Yuzuyu looks; she must be the cutest anime character ever. The expressions on the faces are perfect and the effects are great, even the detail on the cockroach is too good that it looked like the real thing (awww). If there was a problem on the art i would say it has to be that sometimes when the characters are quite far away from the screen, the details seem to vanish. So i will have to give it a 9/10.<br />
<br />
The sound is solid! I am only going to review about the sounds on characters and the background music, I am sorry I can’t do more since there is not a lot i know about music.<br />
Let’s start with the sounds on Japanese subs. I have to say that the best sound in the anime goes to Yuzuyu because i can feel that the sound and the character really really go well together. Not only has that but her expression with world like “cha chan!” made me want to cry of joy since it so heartwarming and as cute as hell!!!<br />
Kokoro&#039;s sound is also great and i like how the cold sound makes her seems emotionless which really suite her character well. Another cold character is Satsuki which I think is really well done; his voice is so emotionless that it is kind of cool. The voice of Kippei also add a nice touch to the character since it is so lively and funny when he plays with Yuzuyu ,the voice is almost opposite of his brother and Kokoro which i think creates a nice balance. Other characters are also great and were done well without any problems.<br />
<br />
And now the music. The OP and ending songs are very relaxing and match the anime well. The background music sometime is good and sometimes is not. I personally think that the exciting scene music and the touching scene music knida have the same tone and that is really confusing since I don’t know if that s the moment when the plot will twist (that is just my opinion). So over all I give it a 9/10 for sound and music.<br />
The characters of this anime are what make this anime so great since they developed so much from the beginning till the end of the story. <br />
Let’s start with Yuzuyu. Her relationship mainly revolves around her and her mother who left her in order to become stronger. Yuzuyu felt that she was abandoned and had no one left until she met Kippei who become like her second mother and a friend to her. <br />
Kippei was almost like a school pimp in the beginning of the story but ever since he met Yuzuyu he became more and more responsible in life and had to make choices that will affect his relationship with people around him in the long run. He taught Yuzuyu a great deal of things but i think he learns more from her.<br />
Kokoro is in a way like a grownup version of Yuzuyu since they had to deal with the same pain of losing their mother but they eventually found Kippei who is like their support in life. <br />
For the characters in the anime i will give 10/10 since it is perfect and there is nothing wrong with slow development.<br />
<br />
For enjoyment i will give 10/10 since it made me laugh so many times just be seeing Yuzuyu face and hearing her voice made my stress goes away :) <br />
<br />
Overall the anime is superb!! and i would recommend you all to watch, you don’t have to be a soft bubbly kids to watch this anime this is something that  even some tough emo kids can enjoy  ^_^<br />
So I will give it a 9/10  <br />

    Cuteeeeeeeeeeee series as you may infer, no doubt of that. however i&#039;m gonna try to do a more objective review putting aside the sweetness of yuzuyu (even though its really hard *__*)<br />
<br />
First of all, i enjoyed the show its pretty low paced and cute. there is some drama but nothing in comparison to other series. you dont feel the urge to marathon the series but still you want to keep watching. overall good serie to bring up little smiles.<br />
<br />
story: 8/10<br />
good enough score for a slice of life anime. the story is just the life of this little kid and a teenager. also the anime doesn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37886">
        completely end so be prepared to end up with some unresolved questions.<br />
<br />
Beware that the synopsis may be misleading. &quot;Katakura Kippei is in every way a high school playboy. Spending his days flirting with any female he can see, responsibility is the last thing on his mind.&quot; you would expect a troubled teenager that doesnt want to take care of the kid and up doing everything wrong. this in the most part is totally false. kippei shows he is a good boy from start to end.<br />
<br />
art: 8/10<br />
little bit outdated. sometimes i felt that the head of yuzuyu was way to big even though that was the intention. it&#039;s matter of getting use to it.<br />
<br />
sound: 7/10<br />
weak. the show has a good soundtrack that somehow matches the enviroment. however its the lack of variety that i didnt like. there is just one op and ed for 26 episodes not even the sound between comercials was changed. so at the end i kind of got bored of the same tracks (background music is also very repetitive).<br />
<br />
character: 9/10<br />
good characters. As i said before kippei is described wrongly in the synopsis he is just the incarnation of a good guy. yuzuyu in the other hand, is a normal 5 year old kid.... without everything bad that a 5 year old kid has. i mean everything she does/say is sooooooooo cuteeeeeeeeee is hard to believe that a child like that exist.<br />
<br />
with this said. characters in this anime tend to be to idealistic or to exaggerated. they are too quite, too aggressive, to cute, too nice..etc so its pretty unrealistic.<br />
<br />
enjoyment: 9/10<br />
This series is like looking at cute cat videos you enjoy it even if they are doing uninteresting things. people who doesnt like cuteness stay away!<br />
<br />
overall: 8/10<br />
Good, not epic. there are no remarkable moments of tears, fights, anger, romance but its overall good...

    I received this anime from an acquaintance and only decided to watch it because when going through stuff to watch and unable to decided, I decided to go alphabetically. <br />
<br />
So Aishiteruze Baby is about a teenage womanizer who is forced to take care of his kindergarten age cousin and thus learns to not be a womanizer, I guess. Well, the story is generic like that anyway, there&#039;s really nothing that comes and takes you by surprise here. <br />
<br />
I actually listened the OST of this anime and surprisingly the music sounded like it could have come from an SNES RPG or something (just a super happy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review62585">
        RPG), which is weird, I think. I didn&#039;t like it. (I feel asleep while listening to it and an a SNES RPG dream so there, lol)<br />
<br />
Characters don&#039;t develop in any interesting way, like I said before, there are no surprises in this anime. None.<br />
<br />
If you like Shoujo and romance anime, then chances are you&#039;ll like this despite it&#039;s predictability. It does nothing wrong, but it does nothing amazing either. The sound isn&#039;t noticeable (at least to me) while watching the series. But still, even if you do like shoujo or romance, I would still save this series for a rainy day when there isn&#039;t anything better to do.

    Five year old Yuzuyu is abandoned by her mother and left with her Aunt and her family. For some reason that wasn&#039;t really explained other than no one else wanted the responsibility Yuzuyu&#039;s 17 year old cousin, Kippei, was given the task of looking after Yuzuyu.<br />
<br />
This is an odd choice as to be honest Kippei is a moron. He is lazy and is content to pass through life relying on his good looks and flirting with girls. Yet Kippei and Yuzuyu hit it off straight away and Kippei actually begins to enjoy the responsibility of looking after Yuzuyu. If you were to describe Kippei&#039;s and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review77911">
        Yuzuyu&#039;s relationship you would describe it as warm and fuzzy.<br />
<br />
Once you begin to enjoy their relationship and you begin to settle down to watching Kippei develop as person and realise he is not as popular with the girls as he thought he was the story hits you hard with a child abuse story involving Yuzuyu&#039;s friend Shouta. Which to be honest, and credit to the show, comes as a big shock. We  also have to deal with other strong stories of unhappy relationships with their parents and teachers involving Miki, a cousin from Yuzuyu&#039;s fathers side and Kippei&#039;s girlfriend Kokoro. All of which contrast strongly with Kippei&#039;s and Yuzuyu&#039;s happy relationship.<br />
<br />
Like all the best anime the success of the show lies in the characters and with a large cast Aishiteruze Baby does not fail to deliver a decent one. Aishiteruze Baby does a great job of developing Kippei&#039;s character as a lazy moron then destroying him a recreating him as lovable character as the story develops. Yuzuyu is as cute as you would expect and there are my two favourite characters Kippei&#039;s violent older sister, Reiko, who turns to marshmallow around Yuzuyu and Yuzuyu&#039;s stuck up friend Marika.<br />
<br />
The artwork looks dated but looks good for an anime from its time and the music fits well without being spectacular.<br />
<br />
I do have one criticism and that it finishes without completing the stories with Yuzuyu&#039;s mother or Kokoro. If it had done that it would have got 10/10.

    Aishiteruze Baby or &quot;I love you, baby&quot; suffers from a title that makes people believe it&#039;s a lolicon, when in fact it&#039;s a very hearfelt but very neglected shojo anime. Really, I feel this series is greatly undervalued, and it does not deserve it. <br />
Enter Katakura Kippei, playboy absolute, who now has to take care of his five year old cousin, Yuzuyu. The first episodes are a bit slow and tiring, but I&#039;m so glad I did not drop this anime,for I was in for a big surprise. What really drives this series is the characters.  Kippei, despite his slacker manner and childishness, is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review101073">
        actually great with Yuzuyu and he develops into a soft spirited, caring guy. Yuzuyu is adorable, and even quiet girl Kokoro improved on further aquaintance. <br />
The situations and backstory of the characters are sad but very well handled, it never felt overdone or cheesy, On a plus, this is the first anime that has brought tears to my eyes (granted, I haven&#039;t seen Clannad, but still). <br />
After I watched the last episode on youtube, I read someone&#039;s comment that said:&quot; I feel like this anime has taught me a lot of things&quot;. Indeed, I felt the same.

    Story &amp; Characters: <br />
Aishiteruze Baby focuses on life of Kippei, a outgoing and carefree highschool kid, who suddenly has to become a guardian to the child of his recently widowed aunt. The story reflects marvelously on the struggles of raising somebody elses child and the problems that arise as Kippei tries to live his life while raising Yuzuyu. I liked how the characters developed as the story moved forward and how the characters background reflected upon their actions and personalities. Aishiteruze Baby is deep down a very peaceful anime albeit it had parts where I might have shed few very very manly tears. <br />
<br />
Art &amp;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175709">
        Sound: <br />
By now the art is obviously relatively old already but it&#039;s still made well enough to still be relevant. Barely any scenes really stood out negatively and the art style fit very well to the mood and style of the show. I personally liked the music and sounds as they fit the show but you should not expect anything mindblowing out of it. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment &amp; Overall: <br />
Aishiteruze Baby is one of those rare shows that are good enough to be watched more than once. It is captivating, moving and the characters really do feel like something you could relate to. While watching this show I just felt like watching on and on (to the point that I had to go to work without sleeping cause I just couldn&#039;t stop watching it).

    Aishiteruze Baby is an anime that I feel has gone almost unnoticed in the 11 years that it&#039;s been around. I&#039;ve never actually met a single person who&#039;s seen this little shoujo. I&#039;d only found out about it a year ago when I wanted to find a shoujo anime that had a male protagonist, and this title showed up, along with Kure-Nai and Natsume Yuujinchou. Since then, I&#039;d held off on the show and hadn&#039;t watched it until just a few days ago. What can I say about this series? Well in short, if you haven&#039;t seen this anime, I highly recommend that you do

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186452">
        so when you have the time. Because it is something that I think any anime fan can really get attached to.<br />
<br />
STORY: 10/10<br />
If you&#039;ve ever heard of an anime called Usagi Drop, then you should know what this story is about. It&#039;s essentially the same setup except instead of having an adult taking care of a child, it&#039;s a high school student, named Kippei Katakura. He is a playboy who is always trying to find a girl to talk to. He eventually is thrust into a situation where he has to care for his 5 year old cousin Yuzuyu, who was abandoned by her mother. The story in this anime works very well. It does a lot of different things that will almost always keep the viewer interested. It deals with many different themes such as lonliness, depression, child abandonment, child abuse, etc. And one of the things I loved most, was that it was able to implement a romance that was not the main focus of the series, but still got all the development that it needed to satisfy the viewer. But at this show&#039;s heart, it is about the growing relationship between Kippei and Yuzuyu that is reminiscent of a child and parent, or rather, child and older brother relationship. This anime has a story that does many different things, and is able to seamlessly mesh then ask together without ever missing a beat, and the end result is a wonderful story . <br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 10/10<br />
From start to finish, every character in this anime changes. They have had many trials and tribulations that have affected them internally and externally. They all developed from what they were and were extremely fleshed out and likable, and to an extent were even very relatable. For me, the best character in this anime is none other than Yuzuyu. She felt like a genuine 5 year old. Incredibly real and still extremely adorable. From beginning to end, I feel she developed the most of all. She had to go through being abandoned by her mother, constantly being talked about behind her back, having to basically start her life over when she was left at the Katakura household. The relationship between her and Kippei was absolutely wonderful. <br />
<br />
ART/ANIMATION: 8/10<br />
Nothing to complain about here really. Granted, this anime isn&#039;t new by any means. This is Toei Animation in 2004, 11 years ago now. It does look a tad aged, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s a problem by any means. I liked the art style as well.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 8/10<br />
The soundtrack for this anime was very nice. Nothing too flashy, it went well with the story and enhances the overall feel of the show, and that&#039;s all I could&#039;ve asked for. The OP and ED were good as well. Now, if I had to complain about ONE thing from this anime, it&#039;d have to be the voice acting. I didn&#039;t particularly have a problem with it, but I could definitely see times when the inexperience showed on the actors. Particularly that of the children, even more particularly for Yuzuyu. Miyu Tsuzurahara, at the time, was only 10 years old. I love the idea of using an actual child to voice a child in an anime. Usagi Drop did the same thing for Rin. However, it worked really well in Usagi Drop. In Aishiteruze Baby, it did not work as well. Again, I liked her portrayal a lot, and I wouldn&#039;t have wanted it any differently, but I know flaws when I see them and there were many in her performance. But hey, she was 10, what can ya do eh? As a whole though, I think the voice acting was very well.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 10/10<br />
OVERALL: 10/10<br />
FINAL THOUGHTS:<br />
Aishiteruze Baby was an anime that I was really excited to watch. I saw Usagi Drop in November and flat out loved it. I wanted more things like Usagi Drop, just not more Usagi Drop. (If you&#039;ve read the manga you know what I mean...) Little did I know that I&#039;d end up loving this anime even more than Usagi Drop. I loved everything that this show had go offer. It has been a while since I&#039;ve seen a show that affected me in a way such as this, and it was a breath of fresh air from start to finish. I highly recommend seeing this anime as soon as you can. It is one of the best shoujo anime I have ever seen, and is something I feel all anime fans can enjoy. Aishiteruze Baby is a truly heartwarming experience.

    I wanted to watch this title since I watched Usagi Drop in 2017 because it was recommended as something similar in any database you go to but I didn’t because I was watching a lot more things. Anyways I finally watched it last year and read the manga last week and I’m very pleased with what I found in them. This review will cover both versions.<br />
<br />
The first thing that needs to be clarify about Aishiteruze Baby is that, despite being compared with Usagi Drop, it doesn’t have a father-daughter relationship and instead features a high school playboy that all of a sudden has to take

          <span style="display: none;" id="review382300">
        care of his five years old cousin, which is more interesting because it can lead to much more character development.<br />
<br />
And it does, throughout the show, Kippei gradually turns from a playboy that does nothing but fooling around with different girls and is a complete disaster at school to a caring man taking care of Yuzu the best he can, learning things about her and parenting along the way. His change is so drastic it even surprises the rest of the cast. It will perhaps feel sudden for some people but I didn’t have any issues with it.<br />
<br />
As for Yuzu, what can I say? She’s a five years old girl that was basically abandoned and still tries to stay positive while she learns lot of things in her everyday life. Unlike Rin in Usagi Drop, Yuzu is not mature for her age in the least, she views everything with a simplistic mindset and often misunderstands what happens and people’s intentions. At the same time, she’s an emotional mess since she was abandoned and is thus very emotionally dependent of others, which is something she more or less learns to handle along the way.<br />
<br />
The show also spends some time in building an emotional connection with some of her belongings that were left behind by her mother and how she eventually grows out of them while also showing how she slowly starts to forget her mother as a consequence of being apart from her.<br />
<br />
At the same time, she has some comical quirks as expected from a girl her age, such as imitating the way bunnies jump from time to time. In other words, her characterization is very solid, she’s both adorable and somewhat tragic, grows along the way and really feels like a five years old kid, except for the annoying moments that every kid has at that age, if something can be criticized about her characterization, that would be it, but I don’t think anyone watching the anime or reading the manga would complain about that.<br />
<br />
The show does not stop at the wholesome semi big brother-young sister relationship between these two and features a bunch of secondary characters to deal with the subject matter even further. On one hand, this means a lot of secondary characters are also fleshed out, which is a plus but on the other hand it also means that almost every single person but the main family in the show has family issues. It is necessary for theme exploration but man does it feel kinda convenient that lots of characters go through similar problems at the same time. I still give it a pass because is basically the series telling you that in reality there’s no perfect parenting, but it can become a little repetitive for some.<br />
<br />
I can at least appreciate the different takes of the subject through them. There’s of course Kippei who has good intentions but messes up most of the time because of his inexperience, there’s Yuzu’s mother who, despite being an adult, is completely unprepared for such role, there’s Kota and his abusive mother, who thankfully is portrayed as a conflicted person and not a one dimensional evil mother as it was the case with a certain once famous show about time travel that deals with a similar theme in a way that feels ridiculous and impossible to take seriously. <br />
<br />
And then there’s Miki, by far the lowest point in this series. Her introduction is very sudden, her interactions with the other characters is not bad but her backstory is completely ridiculous and edgy. It may have made a little bit of sense almost twenty years ago when the manga was being published and the anime aired but even then, it was very over the top and by now is the type of stuff that makes you drop a show and label it as ridiculous. I would put it almost at the same level as the stupid backtory of a character that I’ll just name as chocolate girl from that certain other show. Thankfully she disappears after a few episodes.<br />
<br />
Then there’s Kokoro’s case, by far the most similar to Yuzu’s and the one that strikes the most as kinda convenient (for having two people knowing each other and both of them with similar cases) but that is what makes them undestand each other in the end and thus it works well in terms of interactions between them. The best thing about her is that, despite having her father with her, he’s absent, thus showing that even when a parent is there, it doesn’t necessarily means that they are doing a good job.<br />
<br />
With all that said, I have to admit that the series explores the theme on a basic level and the resolutions are always simplistic, not bad nor superficial but definitely not in a way that feels mindblowing, or revealing/eye opening, is a wholesome slice of life series first and a human drama after. There are some things that come off as a bit melodramatic and are hard to take seriously (what happens with Yuzu’s crayons at the beginning of the show) and you have to suspend your disbelief a little with this show, but outside of Miki’s backstory, it never reaches a point where it breaks your immersion.<br />
<br />
Kokoro also brings the romantic element of the show as she’s the one that, along with Yuzu, turns Kippei from the mess he begins as to the young family man he is at the end. The relationship between them develops along the series and although, yes, is highschool teenage drama, is never exaggerated nor melodramatic. I kinda did a spoiler there, didn’t I? Well, in my defense, the show spoils it in both the opening and the ending so it doesn’t make much difference, and the outcome is kinda obvious anyway. <br />
<br />
Then there are some more secondary characters and they also have a bit of their own storylines but are not related to the main theme, they are there to flesh out the secondary cast and flavor the series but not much would be lost if all of that wasn’t shown. <br />
<br />
In terms of presentation, the manga has a very typical and simplistic shojoish art style that improves a little by the end and the anime makes a good job in translating it faithfully to its medium but its quality is very by the numbers, even for 2004 standards it was very average leaning a little to a below average level for its time and by now it looks like shit. The character designs are generic, quality drops are ever-present, the backgrounds are not finished at times (quite often, I must say), motions are as simplistic as they can and there are rarely any effects that stand out. <br />
<br />
When it comes to the sound, the music works well for the type of show and helps to make some scenes a bit memorable but is not really amazing and the sound effects are…there. As for the voice acting, is to the most part just plain awful. Whether they were newbies or veterans, none of them did a convincing job. Yuzu’s voice actress can be forgiven because she was literally a kid but not excused, a decade later Rin from Usagi Drop, Naru from Barakamon and Tsumugi from Amaama to Inazuma were all performed by girls in her tens as well and they all did a much much better job.<br />
<br />
And even leaving Yuzu aside, the rest have no excuse, especially Kokoro’s voice actress who sounds bored and emotionally absent all the time, making her emotional scenes lacking a little bit every time.<br />
<br />
And now for a short comparison between the two versions:<br />
<br />
-Since the chapters of the manga are about 30 pages long each, the conflicts in the beginning are resolved in one of two chapters at first, so the anime stretched them out a little to last between two or three episodes, aside from obviously making the scenes to last longer than one or two panels. It makes them feel more important without slowing the pace much. Miki’s backstory was more tolerable in the manga though.<br />
<br />
-It gives some secondary characters a little more spotlight, it was unneeded but welcomed. At the same time however, the manga has some other secondary stories that were mostly or completely absent in the adaptation (mainly the sister’s) but even then, the manga doesn’t focus on them that much, sadly.<br />
<br />
-It makes Yuzu’s mother less unlikable by skipping something but at the same time it never shows the resolution of her “character arc” (which happens mostly out of screen anyways).<br />
<br />
-It changes a whole arc from the manga by skipping it almost entirely, on one hand, the arc was a bit melodramatic so keeping it out of the picture was perhaps for the best, but it was also a major point in the development of Kippei and Kokoro’s relationship that even has a big impact in the next arc and the ending, and it doesn’t happen in the anime.<br />
<br />
-Both versions have different endings and neither of them are completely satisfactory, but not bad either. The anime ends by adapting a litte from a certain volume and mixing it with the final volume but is to the most part an open and ambiguous finale that feels like a “and they were happy” one. The manga has a more complete resolution but it came out almost out of nowhere, making it seems like the manga was doing poorly before rushing the resolution as quickly as it could before making a time skip that doesn’t show most of the characters. <br />
<br />
Another reviewer pointed out that Yuzu’s wrote “I’ve always loved you” to Kippei in a letter at the end. About that, I can say that it never feels like the manga develops romantic feelings between the two of them and nothing incestuous happens between them, and I’m grateful for that. I can’t assure this because I obviously didn’t read the raw version and I don’t know japanese, but my guess is that this misunderstanding only happens when reading the manga in english, where love can mean different things, I read the manga on my native language (spanish) which has different words to show different levels of affection towards someone, so this issue wasn’t present there.<br />
<br />
Unexpectedly, three kinda similar show came out last year and none of them are on par with this one or Usagi Drop. Somali to Mori no Kamisama has a feel of adventure and tragedy but its theme of racism is very superficial and is incomplete, Kakushigoto fools around for most of its duration before trolling you with a non tragedy ending and Taisou Zamurai didn’t have that much father-daughter relationship and was filled with random stuff. Compared to Amaama to Inazuma, this series does not reduce parenting to just feeding a child and that’s it. Heck, Aishiteruze Baby is even better than Usagi Drop in my eyes for doing a lot more with its theme, fleshing out more characters and for not going the same disgusting path during its second half in the manga. And I have watched Kurenai recently and the less I talk about that mess of concepts and themes the better.<br />
<br />
Thus, despite looking and sounding like shit and not being anywhere close to amazing, it manages to be the most meaningful and best show of its kind that I watched up until now (I still have some similar shows to watch, such as Akachan to Boku) despite being the oldest, for being longer and more focused, and for fleshing out its characters far more than the rest. <br />

    I couldnt look away while watching this it even brought tears to my eyes.... The only thing about this anime that bugged me was how slow the relationship built between kippei and kokoro..... But other then that I loved the story.... Id recomend it to anyone who wants to watch a really touching story
