    Note: I am writing this review for those who are already familiar with the To Love-Ru series. Perhaps you had seen the first season of Darkness and enjoyed it, but  you&#039;re still skeptical of its sequel. Or despite disliking the first season (Darkness), you, for some reason, are still interested. Maybe, even now, you feel ambivalent. I hope this review will help those who are struggling to make a decision. Lastly, I am a huge fan of the series, but I&#039;ve never read the manga.<br />
<br />
 &quot;To Love-Ru Darkness 2nd&quot; is just as entertaining as its prequels (To Love-Ru, Motto To Love-Ru, and the first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203209">
        season of To Love-Ru Darkness); in fact, the disparity between this and its prequels are, in my opinion, little to none. Unfortunately, this implies that many of its infamous flaws are also present in this second season. In this review, I will explore this season&#039;s strengths and weaknesses.<br />
<br />
Story: 5<br />
<br />
To Love-Ru, as a series, has a weak story. After 70+ episodes, there is little character and plot development; for example, much of the content in each episode (addressing the entire series) is Rito stumbling or slipping while female characters are conveniently nearby which results in a perverted scene. He is then chased or lectured, but ultimately forgiven. This exact scene repeats many times throughout this season. I, however, personally enjoy them and laugh occasionally because the show is self-aware that these scenes would only occur so frequently in a fictitious world.<br />
<br />
As for character development, if you&#039;re here to watch Rito and Lala grow romantically closer, you&#039;ll likely be disappointed; there is one scene, but they simply end up reaffirming those same feelings that they had at the conclusion of Motto To Love-Ru. Additionally, more girls are added to the Harem Plan; furthermore, the characters who, originally, never knew about the plan provide their views on the subject. It&#039;s interesting to see different perspectives because some conflict with Momo&#039;s beliefs, although I had hoped that they would further elaborate on their reasoning. Still, it&#039;s exciting to see that the Harem Plan may not be as perfect as Momo makes it out to be. Interestingly, in this season, there is an antagonist (and I don&#039;t mean random fodder alien assassins) with a goal (not minor transgressions like kidnapping). I was also pleased that the show didn&#039;t feel episodic; there was continuity unlike To Love-Ru and Motto To Love-Ru. <br />
<br />
And although it may appear that I dislike the story, I think the lack of progression is justified in some ways. For example, in To Love-Ru&#039;s universe, only two years or so (maybe less) have passed since the first episode. I don&#039;t know if two years is enough for someone like Rito to suddenly devote himself to over fifteen girls. He&#039;s sixteen; marriage, falling in love, and managing the entire universe are things that most teenagers would never think too deeply about at that age. Moreover, Rito is portrayed as an average male student; his only unqiue trait (that is emphasized) is his kindness and reliability when you really need him. So in many ways, I understand why he feels unsure about these things, especially the Harem Plan. The plot makes this clear several times that polygamy is not allowed on Earth; this implies that, for about 14 years, he has been raised with the idea that marriage is between a man and a woman. Maybe he hasn&#039;t thought about it until he was 7 or 8, but to ask someone to suddenly change their life values and beliefs in just two years seems improbable. As for character development, I think it&#039;s rather realistic that Rito&#039;s personality hasn&#039;t radically changed. I never expected him to suddenly become a whole new person in merely two years. And yes, several times, Mikan does mention that Rito has changed ever since the arrival of Lala and friends, but it&#039;s likely nothing serious as he is still shown to have those same mixed feelings (from the very first season) about marriage, love, politics, and the Harem Plan. <br />
<br />
This is simply my opinion, and I just thought some of these things were worth thinking about. <br />
<br />
My final note: If you don&#039;t like the theme of friendship, you may not like this season.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
<br />
Compared to the very first season of To Love-Ru, the art has significantly improved (I&#039;m sure many of you reading this know that already). Nevertheless, I don&#039;t know much about art; however, to me, the art looks colorful, vivid, and vibrant. I do prefer season 1&#039;s art (Darkness Season 1), but Rito&#039;s, Yami&#039;s, Momo&#039;s, Lala&#039;s, and Mea&#039;s faces are drawn really well this season. (I am in love with everyone&#039;s eyes!) Also it&#039;s interesting to note that the art is so stunning that when you see even a slight drop in quality, it&#039;s rather noticeable. Usually, I have to look for these, but I saw quite a few here -- especially when you&#039;re viewing the characters from a far distance (which is understandable). Nevertheless, I was bothered by how bright everyone looked as well.<br />
<br />
Another example of good art, I think, is the ending. The planets, Yami, and the flowers are all quite artistic.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
<br />
I know I compare a lot, and unfortunately, I&#039;m doing it here again. I only give the sound a 9 because I really enjoyed listening to Rakuen Project by Ray. Secret Arms is fine; I never skipped the opening if that means anything. Conversely, the ending, in this season, is far better. Kawada&#039;s Garden is amazing; if you have some extra time, I recommend listening to the full version as well. The background music, however, wasn&#039;t memorable.<br />
<br />
Characters: 7<br />
<br />
Rito: As I mentioned before, in the story section, I think Rito is growing/maturing, but it appears to be a subtle growth. That said, if you watch the specials (episode 13 and 14 which conclude the season), Rito does something quite surprising and out of character (not because he&#039;s drunk or anything like that; it&#039;s intentional). I wouldn&#039;t call it a serious change, but I like the pace of his growth; it might appear too slow for some, but I think it&#039;s fine. One of my biggest issues with the character, however, is his passive personality.<br />
<br />
Lala: Learns something new from Momo, and there is one other minor thing with Rito, but saying anything more will ruin it. That&#039;s about it. <br />
<br />
Haruna, Kotegawa, : Both characters remain static throughout this season, unfortunately. <br />
<br />
Yami, Nana, and Mea: These three characters are the highlights of this season. If you like any one of them, you&#039;re in luck. The theme is friendship. That&#039;s all I&#039;ll say. And if you didn&#039;t like any of these characters before, you might like them now. You learn quite a bit about each of these characters, and I ultimately felt that they were no longer just one-dimensional characters.<br />
<br />
Murasame Shizu: Even she sort of gets her own episode. Again, the theme is friendship. <br />
<br />
Rin: There is more revealed about her character as well. <br />
<br />
Mikan: Keep on eye out for her. She has some great moments this season.<br />
<br />
Momo: I believe Momo is a character that does not need to change (personality wise). Her presence in the story is what drives a lot of these character actions in the second season. If you liked Momo in Darkness season 1, I think you&#039;ll appreciate her role here as well. Her alluring mischievous personality is always fun to watch.<br />
<br />
 Overall, I think it&#039;s fine that a lot of these characters are still the same after all these years; at least they&#039;re consistent. But until something a little more significant happens to Rito, Lala, and friends, all I can say is that the characters, this season, were good. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
<br />
As I&#039;ve said before, I&#039;m a huge fan (Momo and Yami fan) of the series, so much that I ended up watching the first four uncensored episodes and finished the rest of it (along with the specials) in one sitting. Originally, I had planned on waiting until all 14 episodes were available uncensored, but I simply couldn&#039;t wait; in fact, I plan on re-watching those 10 episodes again once it&#039;s released on Blu-Ray. <br />
<br />
Overall: 10<br />
<br />
To Love-Ru is an anime that truly tests the limits of the ecchi genre; it is the epitome of a borderline hentai. For this reason, you really have to love the characters to continue loving this show. I know I didn&#039;t say much, but if you&#039;ve seen the first season (which I assumed you have) you already know exactly how these characters are. In lieu of a summary, I thought it might be best to tell you what season two has to offer. Honestly, had I not enjoyed the show as much as I did, I&#039;d give this season a 6.5/10. <br />
<br />
Anyways, I suggest giving at least the first uncensored episode a try!<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading.<br />

    I already liked To Love-Ru before (when it was Momo) but this season is so good that I can not stop watching, even went to the manga.<br />
The story is not about the wedding Rito and Lala (protagonists) as in the first season, but it shows more about the other girls. The girls won at least two episodes prominent with Rito, showing why they like him and each showing a different way of acting.<br />
It is impossible not to like the girls, they do not have the same mode of operation as in &quot;certain anime&quot; that all girls like the protagonist and are rubbing it, they show

          <span style="display: none;" id="review211316">
        that like the Rito of different and indirectly.<br />
Despite being a ecchi he can have a good story without disturbing anything, showing the history and how each girl feel about Rito. Many people criticized for not having the same story of the first season, talking about marriage, but the story of Darkness has its purpose and is essential to the history of marriage continue to succeed .If you watched the first two seasons do not waste time and watch this that has the design better and best voices for sure you will see the anime otherwise and you will love it (or else love Momo as all hahaha.)

    This show is practically all about the enjoyment, and I enjoy it a lot!!. If you watched the original TO LOVE RU and the 1st season of Darkness, you will definitely enjoy this show as well as Rito&#039;s Ecchi escapades has no limits and will really keep on going for ever.<br />
<br />
 With the first series, the plot is somewhat episodic due to each episode having different characters to mess around with. However, there is more of a plot in this one; As there is the whole overlaying plot of what DARKNESS actually is and that is talked about through most episodes and each episode connects

          <span style="display: none;" id="review197110">
        to the next, rather than it be episodic.  This could be a positive or negative on what way you choose to look at it. I think the first show (pre Darkness) had it better due to it being more entertaining and random with Rito ending up in random places everytime. &#039;Darkness&#039; s plot is more story and for me (who loved the randomness of the first show), it is a step down . And this carries on to the second season of Darkness. But it is still solid.<br />
<br />
The sound and art are nothing mind blowing but is the art is definetly an upgrade over the past seasons to me personally. And the music is catchy as usual.<br />
<br />
What this show really loses it points on is the characters. While it did the justice of taking, the pointless Haruna away from the Main character list, it came at the risk of Lala and Yui also becoming recurring characters. In the first season of Darkness, i feel like we saw more of them but now all we see is Mea. And i Hate Mea. She has been the focal point for so long, that it becomes a pain evereytime i see her do anything other than lick Rito. As good as Momo is, i still want more screen time Lala and Yui, especially YUI as she is the best character!! But I guess watching Momo and her harem plan will be okay for now.<br />
<br />
For both season of darkness, my main issue has been Yui and Lala not get enough screen time. However, the other characters (except Mea) are still entertaining and Rito&#039;s ecchinnes will never stop. <br />
<br />
Normally i will give this show a rating of 7 cause its just good on every level. But the enjoyment factor is just too much so i gave it a 8 overall.<br />
<br />
PS: try watching once the blue rays come out so you can watch it uncensored, to fulfill your complete thirst <br />

    This is essentially the second season of Darkness, which adds just a bit of plot to the franchise and explains what the title &quot;Darkness&quot; actually means. It has literally been seven years since the original To Love-Ru, and despite the original characters much of the show has changed greatly. What began as a show dedicated to a love triangle between Rito, Haruna, and Lala has now grown to an outright harem large enough to match any competing series out there. The show has increasingly had to rely on blatant ecchi to match the competition to the point where this is essentially soft-core hentai. Moreover, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204951">
        original heroines Lala and Haruna feel all but sidelined as the focus shifts towards Momo, Nana, and a new generation of harem members. Nonetheless, the show retains semblances of its roots, be it ridiculous inventions by Lala or Haruna&#039;s inability to confess her feelings. If harem-based ecchi comedies are up your alley, this is a pretty easy recommendation. If you&#039;ve followed the show up to this point, this is probably one of the better seasons so I wouldn&#039;t miss out. That being said, the ecchi is so in-your-face that god rays often cover the entire screen, leaving you clueless as to what ecchi act Rito is actually committing; if the ecchi part is what you&#039;re looking for definitely wait for the Blu-rays.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
The show retains its overall feel from Darkness, though a fair amount of detail has been given to backgrounds and water scenes. The plethora of characters from previous To Love Ru seasons return with the addition of even more characters; I&#039;ve honestly forgotten some of the more minor characters, and don&#039;t expect the show to remind you who they are. As in previous iterations, expect a lot of blushing and skin. I will say though that I have no idea how Nana tucks all that long hair into her tiny twin tails, it must be a gravitational anomaly or something.<br />
<br />
The show still has a decent amount of action thanks to former assassins Mea and Yami. I have no idea how the school pays for it but expect tremendous collateral damage repeatedly. As for ecchi, expect it literally everywhere. By now, Rito is the king of accidents and always ends up touching or smelling things that require almost constant god rays. To add to this, Momo literally visits Rito to be groped while he sleeps. It&#039;s not just Rito as apparently many of the girls enjoy fondling each other. Indeed, this is among the most shameless shows of the season.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The show opens with a relatively light OP with a fair main melody. The ED feels somewhat nostalgic as Mami Kawada&#039;s nice piece reminds me of her previous work on Index and Shakugan no Shana. As in previous seasons, the BGM is supportive but not particularly memorable.<br />
<br />
The strong VA cast returns for yet another performance heavy in aroused, elated groans. Aki Toyosaki still gives a great performance as Momo though sister Kanae Itou as Nana gives her a run for her money with an emotional performance. Misato Fukuen also does a great job as Yami; her embarrassed voice is particularly good.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
To Love Ru&#039;s revival as a somewhat plot-based show continues, and actually improves in this second season. The early episodes are generally mainly episodic, emphasizing either one of Lala&#039;s inventions gone wrong or focusing on a particular girl. Surprisingly, a fair amount of minor characters gets center stage including Yui Kotegawa and Rin Kujou. Nana also gets a bit more love to balance out with Momo. The most humorous aspect of it all was that an episode is dedicated to Lala, who finally realizes that she&#039;s no longer the center of the world. Despite the episodic feel, the story slowly introduces antagonists and foreshadows events that eventually link the show together. Once you hit the three quarter mark, the show finally decides to get serious and we learn what Darkness really is. To be honest, the first part of the final arc was a bit new but everything after was a tad too predictable. This climax is followed by a likewise predictable and open conclusion. All in all, not too shabby of a run with decent entertainment value throughout, and I don&#039;t just mean the ecchi parts.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
I think Momo and Nana&#039;s characters are finally starting to sink in and feel more like real heroines rather than fill-ins for Lala and Haruna. They, along with Mea and Yami get a fair amount of development. Momo&#039;s harem plan seems to be going well as more and more girls seem to be falling for Rito&#039;s &quot;nice&quot; comments, despite him matching every nice comment with a not-so-nice grope. I still don&#039;t like the fact that the cast is so spread out but it does mean that whatever fetish you have is guaranteed to be covered to some extent by the show, yes including tentacles. The interactions between the girls are still fun as they fight over the idea of winning over Rito vs. submitting to a harem.<br />
<br />
Value:<br />
I feel like this second season of Darkness fixes many of the sour notes that I had from the end of the last season. This revival of sorts of To Love Ru is turning out to be fairly good, albeit ecchi heavy. If you can deal with the massive amount of blurred frames or are able to patiently wait for the blu-rays, this is an entertaining addition to the franchise. Enjoy the Darkness and may it brighten your day.

    A look back at To LOVE-Ru Darkness, my first MAL Review, explaining why I adore this anime, for some reason<br />
<br />
(This review will be reviewing the Darkness series as a whole, not just 2nd) I think it&#039;s safe to start with this, To LOVE-Ru Darkness, is 100%, NOT FOR EVERYONE. In fact, I&#039;m still baffled at the fact of how much I enjoyed this show, especially when I thought the first two seasons (To LOVE-Ru and Motto) were mediocre at best. However... Darkness did it, it got me to not only enjoy, but go out of my way to write a review on it, because that&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363854">
        how much I enjoyed it, so much in fact, that I went out of my way to read the manga to see how it ended.<br />
<br />
Anywho, let&#039;s go over the main factors of Darkness one by one, starting with:<br />
<br />
STORY (6)<br />
I think we all know this, but To LOVE-Ru&#039;s story isn&#039;t exactly a masterpiece, however it&#039;s still enjoyable, especially in Darkness, where the first few episodes set up a promising plotline involving Konjiki no Yami, but again, it&#039;s nothing crazy. To LOVE-Ru does what it has always done, with a similar formula in every episode, Rito is just chilling, then randomly trips or something happens and he ends up falling in a questionable position on top of one of our main girls, which results in TLR&#039;s classic ecchi scenes. Let&#039;s be real though, we enjoy these scenes, because they&#039;re so dumb, we can&#039;t help but laugh at them. Another point in favor of the story I will give, is that the episodes all align together, it&#039;s not just one offs, you can tell they&#039;re progressing the story somewhat. Not only that, you can tell Yuuki Rito has truly been improving his relationships with all the cast, it&#039;s really refreshing to see how every character works off each other and how they&#039;ve changed throughout the entirety of TLR.<br />
<br />
However, it&#039;s safe to say the most interesting part about Darkness story-wise, is Momo&#039;s Harem Plan. Sure, when we watch a harem, we pick a girl and cheer them on, however, To LOVE-Ru teases something that never really happens in anime, they want to go for THE FULL HAREM ENDING, I was shocked, and interested at the same time. Were the madmen really gonna do it? That&#039;s why... I was hooked.<br />
<br />
ART (8)<br />
No complaints here, it looks as sharp as ever, and definitely way more visually appealing than the first two seasons of To LOVE-Ru. The art is incredibly colorful, I like it a lot, all the characters were drawn incredibly well. (I do think however, the manga&#039;s art is on another level, but the anime still does a fine job!)<br />
<br />
SOUND (8)<br />
In my opinion, the OST is pretty forgettable so I can&#039;t really give it a precise score. I do however really enjoy both the openings and endings, so based on just those, a solid 8 will do.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER (9)<br />
I don&#039;t know why, but I love every single character in this show. They all feel unique, even the ones I hate, I can think to myself &quot;I can see how other people might enjoy these types of characters&quot;. I really do like all the characters, however, this season&#039;s main cast (besides Yuuki Rito) are just a breath of fresh air compared to having to focus on Haruna and Lala, who I find on the weaker side of all the characters.<br />
<br />
The characters that really push TLR Darkness over the limit for me are of course, Yami, Momo, Mea, and Nana. In my opinion, they&#039;re the best characters by far, and they really help the enjoyment of the show. The theme of TLR Darkness, at it&#039;s core, is building friendships (while this doesn&#039;t apply specifically to Momo), and seeing Yami build her relationship with the rest of the cast, finally feeling like a true character, you truly can see her growth since the first few episodes to now. On the other side, Nana and Mea&#039;s friendship is very interesting, you really feel for them, I won&#039;t say much because it&#039;s best you experience their arcs by watching the series.<br />
<br />
Going back to Momo, she&#039;s not really part of the &quot;friendship&quot; or &quot;building relationships&quot; side, but I still find her very enjoyable, especially since she was the creator of The Harem Plan. She basically drives the story, pushing Rito along to the coveted harem ending. I think her personality is also fun to watch.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT (10)<br />
I absolutely enjoyed every single second of both Darkness and Darkness 2nd, especially since they give major screentime to my 2 favorites (Yami and Momo). Bias aside, watching this show is just fun. I could watch it again any day, I just feel relaxed watching the show, be it the artstyle or the characters. (And hey, if you&#039;re into ecchi scenes, if you watch TLR uncensored, you&#039;re in for a treat!)<br />
<br />
OVERALL (9)<br />
To LOVE-Ru, I would say, goes beyond the harem genre to make itself stand out beyond the rest. I mean yeah, this show is borderline hentai, but it&#039;s characters, art, animation, even the story from time to time, are something that I have yet to see another harem do as well as it. It&#039;s an incredibly satisfying ride to go from the &quot;meh&quot; of To LOVE-Ru to seeing it all grow into this, while it might not objectively be a &quot;good anime&quot; or &quot;amazing storytelling&quot;, I definitely consider TLR Darkness to be one of my favorites.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading my first ever review, have a nice day!<br />
<br />

    I&#039;ll try to keep the review as spoiler free as possible, but there are a couple of points I do want to bring up. And this is also not a formal review as Darkness 2nd is a continuation of the series. I&#039;m also assuming you&#039;ve watched all of the episodes leading up to the current season<br />
<br />
First of all, In this season, we continue with the main characters shifting away from Lala and Haruna. The main focus of the series is on Momo, Nana, Mea, and Yami. And for only for a couple of episodes is Lala actually participating. There is a small bit of Lala

          <span style="display: none;" id="review212405">
        love for you fans out there, but the most you see of her is in the Last episode and the Specials. <br />
<br />
In terms of Mea, she really begins to develop as a character. We see a lot of exposition of her and a new character. We also see Yami develop as a character more towards the end of the season.<br />
<br />
Overall, If you have watched the previous seasons, its worth a watch as there actually is plot to the season, and you must watch the 13th and 14th episodes disguised as specials,<br />

    Let me start off by saying: I LIKED TO LOVE RU. Ok so, this is not gonna be a legit review of this series, I just felt like i needed to say some things about this series.<br />
<br />
After watching 70+ episodes of this series I can say that I just got tired of it. And I have 2 reasons as to why.<br />
<br />
First, The main character. i just can&#039;t take him seriously, you would think after so many episodes he would get used to seeing all of the girls&#039; naked bodies, but no. Also he doesn&#039;t realize that 90% of the girls want his D. Like, Lala

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401002">
        has straight up told him that she likes him, but he just doesn&#039;t make any progress with her because he&#039;s not sure about his feelings or some BS, like dude just go for the P. And I know this series is targeted for a younger audience but still, I think they could have managed it much better imo.<br />
<br />
And secondly, The anime just got wayyyy too repetitive. Like it was funny at the start, but every episode is almost the exact same, Rito falling headfirst into a girl&#039;s panties. That&#039;s it. <br />
<br />
But the good thing about this series is, The first season of darkness actually has a decent plot and also great &quot;plot&quot; so that&#039;s that I guess.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I dont wanna be salty about some echii anime on the internet, so I&#039;ll just leave it at that

    The audience disappointed me once again. It seems ridiculous to me, especially not to like the first two seasons and to like the darkness. I respect everyone&#039;s opinion, you may not like the previous ones but these 2 seasons are definitely not better than them. I also understand that the main characters have changed due to special circumstances, it wouldn&#039;t be a problem if it handle done well, but the series unfortunately couldn&#039;t do that.<br />
<br />
I have nothing against fanservice (i have watched many ecchi shows with enjoy) but the fanservice in To Love Ru-Darkness seems way pointless for me. Unlike the prequel seasons, they&#039;re made

          <span style="display: none;" id="review393541">
        just to be made and they&#039;re not funny.<br />
<br />
The anime tried to be To Love Ru, but really failed. I don&#039;t mind that the story shifted to diffrent charcters, but I do mind that it shifted to the wrong characters. It&#039;s called &quot;Darkness&quot;, so I expected to find out more about Golden Darkness, and I did, the problem is that side characters just became main charcters. Momo and Nana are not part of the main character Lineup. The relation between Rito, Lala and haruna became irrelevant, which is pretty bad, considering that they were the main reasoning for the story. For some reason the also thought it would be a great idea to make Rito love Momo more than Lala and Haruna, eventhough they really aren&#039;t that close as they illustrate it. <br />
<br />
I think it would have been better if the series had only focused on the side characters instead of the main and side characters making this unfimiliar and weird story lineup. This just isn&#039;t a good series anymore and since xebec have broken up their won&#039;t be an attempt to fix this mess. On the other hand it is sad to see the series fade out likethis. I really do hope someone will buy the licens to the anime and completly reboot it, by fixing the mess these two dark seasons have made.<br />
<br />
If you decide to watch Darkness s1 &amp; s2, you will see that it is actually a standard ecchi anime made to entertain the audience with the whole season of Rito falling randomly on another girl&#039;s pantsu. And also it&#039;s funny how the series pretends to have a good story.

    The fourth part in the To LOVE Ru series is as enjoyable as ever.<br />
I do still miss Lala who has lost her role as main character since Darkness.<br />
But as for the rest of the season?<br />
The Art is amazing in the To LOVE Ru series as a whole, and the new concepts in the &#039;&#039;darkness&#039;&#039; Idea are overall beautiful.<br />
The music is as fun and enjoyable as it has been since the first season with more &#039;&#039;darker&#039;&#039; themes to go along with the darker aspect of this season.<br />
Characters have been getting a lot of development in Darkness 2nd, e.g. Yami or Mea who are both learning to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review224228">
        live completely as normal humans instead of the weapons they were made to be.<br />
The main focus is again comedy, which is beautifully present in this season.<br />
The ecchi elements that are the drive for the comedy have been getting a bit too frequent and forced this time around, but still as great as in the previous seasons.<br />
Overall this series is amazing from the light-hearted storytelling to the comedy that should leave you laughing yourself to bits.<br />
It&#039;s my favourite series and will stay so if the series continues as it is.

Why!? JUST WHY!!!<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story is as good as a ecchi-harem gets. The main character gets to do ecchi things with the others and it&#039;s a good comedy. Although I do find the whole premise to be stupid, it&#039;s supposed to be stupid, so I just don&#039;t give it much thought.<br />

Art:<br />
I don&#039;t care about art much.<br />

Sound:<br />
I don&#039;t care about sound much.<br />

Character:<br />
Oh, don&#039;t get me started about characters. Especially Mr. Main Character, Yuuki Rito. He is the perfect character to be in this situation. Clumsy enough to grope every single woman he sees, stupid enough to never think about, nice enough to win girls, dumb enough to

        commit to someone he won&#039;t confess to, and dumb enough to be unable to commit with anyone else. As much as I hate him, he is perfect for this story.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Man, there are so many sins in this story, but damn can I not get enough of it.

    welp i just finished watching to love ru-darkness 2nd and the specials. damn that was fun to watch. i was expecting a bit more with the story but well it was great i guess.<br />
we see more fighting scene (well kinda..) and of course more falling scene from the god of falling himself, rito.<br />
i dont know what to say due to the fact that i already did a review on to love ru darkness 1st season. <br />
im a bit sad that they haven&#039;t continue this series until now, its been 3 years or more since this season&#039;s airing. welp i still have the ovas to watch.<br />
<br />
this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review299540">

the story is well.. unique i guess.. well not necessarily unique bcs i&#039;ve seen it in other anime but damn it never failed to make me laugh hahaha! <br />
<br />

    tl;dr: A solid continuation that wraps up the plot threads associated with the Darkness arc while also being very amusing.<br />
<br />
This season is a direct continuation of the previous season, which of course is a direct follow up to the plot, but also continues to keep the same atmosphere and tone while also mostly focusing on the same characters. To be completely honest, the two seasons are similar enough that they&#039;ve sort of blurred together in my mind.  The core focus in terms of characters in addition to Rito is still on Mea, Nana, Yami, and Momo. Mea&#039;s character development alongside her relationship development with Nana

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345339">
        is one of the main threads in the series, which also leads to both gaining some relationship development with Rito. Mea&#039;s relationship with her master Nemesis is also important, though it mostly only matters in terms of the finale. Oshizu&#039;s relationship with Mea, which had so far been one of extreme wariness, also gets some development into a strange sort of friendship. Yami doing her best to live peacefully and her relationship with Tear and Mikan to an extent get development over the course of this season, though the focus on her mainly comes at the end where it truly tackles who she is and what she wants to do and how Rito fits into all that. The finale itself focuses on wrapping up Yami and Mea&#039;s plot threads and does so in an epic finale manner with a single event spanning multiple episodes, which is something that hadn&#039;t been attempted by the series since the finale of the first season. Thankfully, unlike the finale to the first season, the finale of this season wraps things up incredibly well, racketing up the intensity a good amount, but keeping events focused and consistent with the rest of the series in terms of tone and atmosphere, and doing very well by the characters being focused on in wrapping up everything built up relating to Yami, Mea, and the titular Darkness really well.<br />
<br />
Momo is still very much carrying out her own plans, but in terms of an overarching plot thread it felt it takes a back seat to the one focused more on Mea and Yami. The previous season developed what the harem plan was and pushed it majorly forward with some key characters like Run and Yui that weren&#039;t a part of the plot thread involving Yami and Mea so it felt like it made major progress. It pushed things forward with Nana and Yami as part of their own plot thread, which while still progress didn&#039;t feel like actual progress in this regard due to the progress in this regard being indirect. There&#039;s also a push for progress with Haruna and Lala that is handled well, but both of their arcs are already over in a sense, with the only thing possibly remaining being for them to actually be part of a harem ending, which doesn&#039;t feel any closer to happening overall, so it doesn&#039;t feel like much progress was made there either. The only character that actually made noticeable progress in this regard was Rin, the progress of whose relationship with Rito was solid, however as its the only real progress that&#039;s occurred with Rito over the course of the series the relationship feels a bit weak for how late into the series it is. Thus while there is a good amount of content regarding Momo and her harem plan that&#039;s really well done in and of itself, it doesn&#039;t feel like the plan overall has moved any closer to a conclusion. This doesn&#039;t feel like much of an issue while watching as the focus is on the other plot threads, especially the finale, but afterwards it really feels like things were really left hanging.<br />
<br />
The art and animation are very well done as usual and mostly about the same as the previous season. The animation regarding actions seems to be noticeably improved from the previous season however. The comedy and random antics are still as amusing and well done as usual. The OP and ED are both decent enough in terms of visual and audio. The soundtrack is still mostly not that memorable, but certain more intense tracks during action and serious sequences stood out.

Fanservice, a group of likable girls, and sweet comedies that serve to entertain the viewers mindlessly. To LOVE-Ru Darkness is a godsend to this series as it expanded on that premise with the establishment of a solid story. This second part was no exception, continuing from before with more focus on the plot revolving around Yami and Mea that it had previously set up.<br />
<br />
With the introduction of the unknown Master who finally came out of the shadow, this season explored the idea of friendship and feelings more abundantly than its predecessors. There was already quite

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277729">
        a mysterious presence in the hearts of some of the girls, some more and some less. Especially those who came from a non-Earth background. It&#039;s there, but it was pretty subtle to really grasp how serious their feelings were. So when the story decided to mingle around with this concept prominently, it created a deeper depth outside of the romance that had been there since the beginning, relatively speaking. Interactions with each other revealed the growing bonds as they slowly come to terms with their own true feelings. Their secrets or their emotions, it was all used to further develop the girls away from something that was just for entertainment. They actually have an identity. In a way, their portrayal was sensibly realistic for an ecchi show and that made watching them all the more fun because they actually grew in character while also having the pleasant amusing side to them. So that said, mindless entertainment was still a big factor in this season, mostly rooting from the harem keikaku in progress that inched the girls ever closer towards Rito. And with Rito&#039;s stunning skill of falling over in the most absurd ways at the most wrong times, there were a bunch of comical ecchi scenes in play that really defined this whole series from the very first episode. The situations of all sorts of awkwardness delivered in being entertaining while also solidifying how likable each girls are. Still some repetition, but it wasn&#039;t as annoying compared to the previous ones which was either due to me getting used to them already or the story additionally improved the characters enough where I don&#039;t mind them now. Or both.<br />
<br />
First thing that I noticed for some reason was the thinner line work. The softer look of the visuals felt pleasing to the eyes so I really liked the slight change there. Animation was consistent with maintained smoothness and I&#039;m amazed by the continual improvements that came with each season. Somewhat greater vibrancy in the eyes with even more distinct shine on the curves meant that everything stood out brightly but not too over-the-top with unreasonable whitewash. This art style drew forms to the apparent focus of emotions presented throughout the story. You&#039;ll know how attached you are to the characters if their feelings also affected you on an emotional level. Whether it&#039;s the vigorous cuteness of euphoric nature that radiated from their expressions or their rarely seen sadness, seeing them placed a smile on my face and can hit me with all sorts of feels too. In the ecchi department, warmer hues of red and orange enveloped the scenes. Although not that obvious, these color choices represented the emotions of love, romance, and an exciting warmth that sprayed the air into something stimulating. It pretty much added more style and substance when these was shown so if you already loved the ecchi part of the series, then it&#039;s a no-brainer that you will also love the ones in here. Great soundtracks and passionate voice-acting let out all the character&#039;s personality into the atmosphere, molding it to match the current mood. Whether that&#039;d be a fun or a more serious one, the sounds harmonized together in a pretty great way. A fun melody is the result of that creation. Hey, and that ending sequence was visually and acoustically nice to experience. Maybe that&#039;s because of the focus of Yami but every girls here are great too of course.<br />
<br />
To LOVE-Ru Darkness 2nd is a season of growing feelings, from both the characters and me as a viewer. Not only in a lovey-dovey manner but also with the prominence of friendship, family, and identity to add a bit of something, a bit of realism, into the characters to make them even more likable. It&#039;s this appealing side of the show along with the humorous ecchi situations that really got me to appreciate the series. This steamy enjoyment of energetic cuteness is awaiting you!

    At last, I finally finish the anime that is (almost) considered borderline hentai at this point.<br />
<br />
<br />
To LOVE-Ru Darkness 2nd is an continuation on the series following golden darkness and her story. I&#039;m honestly so surprised that this anime, despite the numerous pantie shots, was actually a good watch. Albeit it goes a bit over board in this season, there&#039;s enough backstory for it to work with to make the over all &quot;story&quot; here outweigh the almost-hentai that this anime has become. <br />
<br />
The characters have a sort of love-hate relationship with it&#039;s viewers (at least with me). I really wish that instead of showing Rito tripping

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292259">
        and *majorly* messing up a bunch by *accidentally* groping girls constantly, that they would go back to how it was in the first season (aka, not as much, but enough to make it funny and not over-done).  And this for me, is a huge reason why I can&#039;t give this anime a higher rating. However despite all of that, I still found the majority of characters interesting enough to keep the story moving. <br />
<br />
This anime for me is a tough one to recommend. But if you&#039;re reading this review and have made it this far already, then I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll mind watching this season. All in all there&#039;s a lot of good here. Good characters, a great OP, and a decent-enough story to carry. Definitely watch if you were considering, it has a pretty good ending!

    Story (7/10) - To LOVE-Ru Darkness 2nd is the final installment in the To LOVE-Ru anime adaptation. I feel as though the ending was unresolved, but I&#039;m sure the producers had something in mind.<br />
<br />
Art (8/10) - This season of art was the best in the series. (Which makes sense since this is the end.)<br />
<br />
Sound (7/10) - The intro was the best in the series, in my opinion. The visuals were also appealing as they pertain to the main goal of the series.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (7/10) - The fluid hilarity, ecchi accidents, and reaction to said accidents is timeless in this series, and is still very evident. <br />
<br />
Overall

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262874">
        (7.4/10) - The ending of this anime felt like a disappointment, or rather, left on a cliffhanger. Regardless, it is sad, since this is so close to the end.

    First things first. My &quot;reviews&quot; system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.<br />
------<br />
Review is mostly about Darkness seasons while having similar opinion regarding pre-darkness seasons.<br />
-----<br />
<br />
✦Story<br />
To put it in a most simple way.<br />
<br />
Love-Ru franchise is pinnacle of great borderline ecchi and harem.<br />
<br />
Now to give some extra comments. It&#039;s a very bright Anime with some darker subplots. It also offers plenty of characters and their development between various characters and main character himself. Even though it&#039;s harem story where romance is more of a fun element than drama, we still get plenty of dramatic moments, sad moments and as well very

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293405">
        sweet moments. Also I do love there is a quite big background story that now and then shows presence. Plus the whole &quot;harem plan&quot; story element is also great fun.<br />
<br />
Maybe this would go more under &quot;characters&quot;, but as it plays a big part in the story I will have to mention our main male lead character. He is the pinnacle of naive, shy and unlucky lucky pervert character. Those characters usually are lead around by women and get into very erotic situations, where usually those characters end up essentially passing out from embarrassment. And in this type of ecchi AND harem Anime it is extremely pleasant part. As most characters genuinely love or care about our main character, It is essential for me that the targeted character would now use in underhanded or disrespectful way those feelings. Even though sometimes his shyness can get frustrating. I do still respect him more as I wouldn&#039;t have such strong heart to able resist all of those characters and situations our main character gets into. So in that sense how everything remains pure and loving PLUS very importantly VANILLA, I do like that our main guy can get serious to consider character feelings and struggle on a idea of harem. So respect to that guy. I would not simply able to keep my sanity in his place and that would end up destructive and ruin most relationships. If only complaint I have regarding him and his whole story and development between characters, then it would be that how the actual f*** he simply almost never got boner.. that is simply unreal. Personally watching this Anime was probably 90% of the time having blood rushing. But I still adored the purity and vanilla aspect to utmost highest level.<br />
<br />
As whole franchise I feel there surprising amount of actual storytelling and some progression between characters. One of the Anime that I pray will get fully adapted as I&#039;m really intrigued how it all will end up.<br />
<br />
Now, of course story being existent and everything is a nice thing. BUT the most important thing about this Anime is probably &quot;art of eros&quot; the fanservice, scenes and such are probably conveyed and presented in the most amazing way I&#039;ve ever seen. Giving us plenty of straight-on fanservice and obvious &quot;references&quot; regarding some things. But how they are done and shown are so much hotter than a large portion of actual hentai. But more about in the &quot;Art&quot; section.<br />
<br />
Point still remains, even though there is some romance, drama and interesting world plus actual plot. This Anime main focus and the most impressive asset, is it&#039;s fanservice/ecchi genre.<br />
<br />
✦Art &amp; Sound<br />
Art art art... this Anime is pinnacle of ecchi genre. I do absolutely love this artist style. Character designs are pleasing, there all sorts of them. Animation is superb, colors are bright. And ecchi element is incredibly erotic. Bare skin is superb, body parts are superb, clothes are superb, straightforward erotica is superb, &quot;covered&quot; erotica is superb a.k.a use of imagination. Most definitely more erotic/sexier than a large portion of actual hentai. Even the most simple panty shots and such were extremely pleasing, whilst lewder panty shot moments were unbearable amount erotic. In in almost every scene, aspect no matter what element it was, it was either extremely pleasing to look at or extremely erotic depending on intention of the scene or still shot.<br />
<br />
Music &amp; Ost was for the most part pretty impressive and good. But as well there were quite some tracks that had 0 presence at all.<br />
<br />
And voice acting, aside great lewd moments, there were plenty of Angelic voices.. Tearju and Yami for example. I loved their voices A LOT.<br />
<br />
✦Characters<br />
A lot of different girls, a lot of great use of stereotypes, sweet amount of romantic moments, progression and development of characters and relationships between the characters.<br />
<br />
Main guy I mentioned in &quot;story&quot; section as I felt it was required.<br />
Aside that we got so many superb characters that I don&#039;t even want to discuss. I simply loved almost each and every of the character, whenever the character was part of the main cast or supporting characters.<br />
<br />
✦Enjoyment &amp; Overall<br />
In short. It&#039;s fun, bright, extremely hot. Is also quite sweet regarding romance and has some very sweet dramatic moments. Absolutely great art style and character designs. Superb cast and top tier use of stereotypes plus characters overall were simply a lot of fun and joy.<br />
<br />
Story is actually pretty nice with plenty of interesting points in it. But at the same time it is simply enough for straightforward fun.<br />
<br />
It will go into my list of favorites that&#039;s for sure. But It won&#039;t get full score from me for two primary reasons. One would be that ost/music could been a bit better and done better and another would be the story could had a bit more development regarding relationships. But if this Anime get&#039;s fully adapted and get&#039;s satisfying finale. Then such &quot;final season&quot; might get 10/10 from me.<br />
<br />
Absolutely bless &quot;art of eros&quot; type of Anime<br />
Also absolutely love pure/vanilla love and romance type of Anime.<br />
Well done pure and sweet romance with extremely lewd presentation.<br />
Respect to Rito even though he is simply a bit pathetic, still respect for not giving in to the lust and keep himself back even through fate constantly threw at him erotic situations, easy grab moments and such a fantastic and beautiful harem at him.<br />
<br />
I feel I forgot a lot of things I wanted to mention. But this review is simply long enough.<br />
<br />
TLDR: If you like vanilla romance, harem and top tier ecchi. Then this is most definitely one of the series to watch.

    Darkness 2nd is the follow-up of Darkness and a worthy sequel for this series. It offers a great amount of ecchi content, comedic scenes, and fun. If you want to plot and serious dialogue or anime in general go check a drama because this is the total opposite of that. For example, some advancements are a girl transforming and wanting to do perverted things with people or falling and magically getting your nose in a girl&#039;s panties, that happened a couple of times and to the point I would believe one or two got pregnant by his nose but overall it is pretty sexual and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407950">
        fun to watch.<br />
<br />
The story is as usual about Rito&#039;s alien harem (for which he is still really skeptical) and how like all ecchi harem protagonists keeps on arousing girls and getting themselves in rather sticky (quite some meanings) and sexual situations, the plot is pretty nonexistent but I would call it &quot;sufficient&quot; for a series like this. I know this is a continuation of To Love-Ru darkness but they could have calmed things down and changed the story, now it is just all about the trans weapons and Momo wanting to make a harem with all the girls (well look that satisfies everybody (not as much as choosing one girl) but it hurts less than not having your girl chosen so I guess that is cool). Also, Lala trying to advance her relation with Rito but him being stuck on Sairenji and Lala telling him to tell her when his feelings are for real mutual. Bruh just does that I have been waiting for this for over 90 episodes lol. The story is a 6.<br />
<br />
The art is exceptional as always, this aired in 2015 and well, the quality is like 2017 now, it is really vibrant but soft, sweet, simple, and beautiful. I do include the *ECCHI* category with art so imma just say it was pretty daring, a thing that makes this series different than the rest is how many scenes are really sexual or include the girls&#039; lower parts. Others are just boobs all the time which is equal to this but well it is a fine touch. 9/10 <br />
<br />
The opening for darkness 2nd is &quot;secret arms&quot;, I liked this quite a lot because I think I had heard it somewhere, 9 cause the music is catchy and cute alongside the cute lyrics. &quot;Gardens&quot; is the ending of the series. It is beautiful and cute, very cute, and also had some spice. I would give this a 9 as well. The voice acting is great like usual too, I think sound deserves a 9<br />
<br />
All the characters got their own thing and personality we know about now. They are memorable and unique too, I see nothing bad other than the lack of depth in plenty of them but well it is an ecchi series, I can&#039;t really badmouth it for something like this. Overall really cute and interesting characters (-mc). 8/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment? another easy 10, it was pretty energetic, seducing, and funny. Just a formula for a fun time and the fact it looked good and that the characters were so cute just added more to it. I will give this series an 8.5 as well since it was pretty much the same and even a bit more repetitive and thus worse than the first season of darkness. It also didn&#039;t have as many ecchi scenes which is the heart of this series. Still worth watching and the 2nd or 3rd best season of the series
