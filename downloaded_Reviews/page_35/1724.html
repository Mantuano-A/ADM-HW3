    I did enjoy the plot idea of the first couple of episodes of this show, especially with all the different and unique quirks used in the battles between classmates of 1a and 1b. It&#039;s nice how they bring back the fights from season 2 and make them even better with their new special moves and all that. However, in my opinion, the battles were just so boring, and it was the only reason why I gave up watching the show and started to speed read the manga. I knew that the fights between both classes are only a couple of chapters long, and after that,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395519">
        it gets to the good shit. However, the battles just seemed so useless, and I would prefer if the studio would start the adaptation at the beginning of the next arc since it&#039;s just better than the class battles in pretty much everything.<br />
<br />
Besides that, I can&#039;t see this show becoming darker because it&#039;s just so childish. After all, when I started watching this show at the beginning of last year. I always believed it to be some kid show with some adult and darkish jokes and scenes stashed behind it. I could see this in the fights like the one between All Might vs One for All because it was indeed the most important battle back then. However, after the battle finished, the show slowly loses its excitement and maturity and eventually becomes childish once more. I look at this as a repeating cycle that happens in every season, and it just makes me pissed when it happens because it just ruins my enjoyment of the show.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I would rate this show a 1/10 due to the disappointment it gave me. I would have rated it a higher score if the show had evenly distributed the dark themes and plot points throughout the previous seasons.<br />
<br />
Notes: I would be pissed if they have to add another season just to start the next arc because I have to wait another year or more just to come out (I&#039;m becoming impatient with this show now).<br />
<br />
I also hate the downgrade of the animation for this season. It was really good in season 4, but in this season, it&#039;s just so crap. I hope the animators fix it after the class battle arc is finished.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, I just hate every single character in the show besides Creati, and you should know why.<br />
<br />
Also, if you don&#039;t like my opinion about this show, it&#039;s fine with me. I don&#039;t mind if you love this show, and I won&#039;t bully you just for that. Go like what you like. I&#039;m not here to ruin your favourite things lmao.

    This show got worse? I’m sorry, but what the fuck are you talking about? How is this any different than it has ever been? <br />
<br />
Ever since working from home became a thing, my alcoholism has gotten exponentially worse, and I think I’m dying. Sometimes I’ll stand up, and then just find myself on the floor. Other times I can’t tell if I’m hungover, legitimately ill, or if I simply laid down funny and part of my body fell asleep. I’ve been an insomniac for years, but now my circadian rhythm is completely fucked. But the biggest issue is my memory. I’d rather eat nails than

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418205">
        try watching this shit sober, so much of this season is foggy to me, but what I do remember about it just makes me want to drown myself in even more liquor. Most of it is spent going back to interclass tournament arc style bullshit that’s filled with recap footage and feels like filler even when it isn’t. It was dumb, ugly, and I hated every second of it. The villains come back toward the end, but they’re still one-dimensional nobodies with nothing interesting to say about anything, and there’s still zero stakes because, just in case you forgot, “This is the story of how I became the greatest hero!” The artwork and coloration are hideous since Bones only cares about making non-canon movies, the show is 80% still images, the pacing is at once horrendously rushed but at other times painfully slow, and the fights are more panning stills with people screaming and crying at each other like autistic babies. It looks awful and nothing about it is entertaining. Everything it has ever done, is doing, and will continue to do has been done before, sometimes well, but often terribly, and even in the former case, many such properties are dragged out until they crash and burn or just slowly decline into dogshit. This series is somehow doing both, but you wouldn’t think so if you listened to its common reception, and I find this rather odd. Apparently, this show began to sully its reputation during season four, and its deterioration has clearly continued, but what’s weird is this has prompted people to start reminiscing about better times, and I don’t understand this at all. People talk about the good ol’ days, back when this was a show about a powerless kid working hard and overcoming weakness and hardship, whereas now we’re just watching an overpowered Gary Stu with infinite power who’s totally unsympathetic, and therefore it’s worse. This is not only bizarre considering the quote I used earlier, where season one begins by outright telling us Midoriya is destined to become the world’s greatest hero, but also because the series never embraced these themes to begin with. <br />
<br />
I know it’s typical to refer to the protagonist of a story as the “hero,” but one should only be celebrated as a hero if they preform heroic feats. People often conflate heroism with classic altruism, being a selfless actor who is concerned more with the needs and wishes of others than with their own, but whereas altruism is more about selflessness no matter the context, actual heroism requires self-sacrifice, putting yourself in harm’s way for the sake of others. It is for this reason the word is so often associated with the phrase, “war hero,” a solider who loses their life in battle placing valor, duty, and honor above their own personal safety. When it’s revealed All Might wasn’t born with a quirk and had instead been given one by a benefactor, it squanders the underdog story inherent in Midoriya’s determination to become a superhero despite his own powerlessness, but it also makes you wonder. What is even the point of delineating between people with and without quirks when, by this logic, a quirk isn’t even a congenital factor of one’s birth? The concept of “disadvantage” doesn’t hold in a world where “advantage” is a tangible commodity able to be gifted. This misunderstands the burden of superpowers and what it actually means to have one. The privilege of power materializes only in what you are physically able to do as compared to those without such privilege. Advantage is a blessing, a boon, it makes life easier like advanced technology, modern infrastructure, or even clean water does in the developed world, but as seen in Italy’s invasion of Ethiopia (then called Abyssinia) in 1935 or Japan’s invasion of China in 1937, advantage also makes violence and destruction far more devastating when used against the disadvantaged, so as the saying goes, “with great power comes great responsibility.” You can’t fuck around like a stupid, self-obsessed teenager if you can also go nuclear, and this is exactly what boils my blood about My Hero Academia. They insist it’s about heroism, but it’s really about ambition. Mount Lady became a hero for the sole purpose of gaining celebrity status by letting people take pictures of her giant ass in spandex, and Bakugo himself openly admits he&#039;s motivated by glory and proving his egotistic sense of superiority. What the hell does any of this have do with heroism? This is vanity and pride. People these days use the word “hero” so glibly, as if “icon” and “hero” have somehow become synonymous, decided by popularity as opposed to the morality of one’s conduct. <br />
<br />
It seems the real heroism was the sales we made along the way. Any celebrity or public figure can be christened a hero simply because they’re successful, not because they’re righteous. Bakugo shouldn’t have been allowed to participate in the hero exam in the first place! He thinks like a villain, and had the exam really been a matter of heroism, he would’ve been rejected the second he opened his mouth. Instead he’s allowed to progress, because as long as he scores high enough in the exam, anyone can. UA Academy, and by extension this entire show, does not promote heroism. Being accepted by the school because you’re powerful doesn’t give you moral license to call yourself a hero because not only have you preformed nothing heroic, but never does it require you to. It’s therefore not teaching you to be a hero either, because it permits motivations like fame and glory which by definition are completely unheroic. In fact, what the series truly promotes is this bizarre doctrine of social Darwinism. It contradicts the very themes its terminology attempts to establish while also brainwashing the teenagers and college kids watching it into thinking heroism is something totally selfish. Midoriya’s origin story seems to want to promote the idea that you don’t necessarily have to be powerful to do good, and the desire to do good can itself lead to you becoming powerful (while also being sure to portray said power as an opportunity to do so). You only need half a mind to see how it utterly fails to do this when All Might simply hands him the power needed to proceed, rendering his entire training montage pointless, but what many don’t realize his how insidious this mindset truly is. I’m not saying the author of this series is evil—in all likelihood, they’re simply naive—but they fail to understand the social implications of saying the desire for power to achieve goals is intrinsically heroic. If you start with nothing and attempt to become powerful to do good, the probability that your perception of justice is not seated in jealously of the privileged who you feel have done injustice to you is incredibly slim, especially in a world like this where the “have nots” are openly discriminated against by the “haves.” I’m not saying the only vehicle for realism is cynicism, but what I am saying is such a contrived, saccharine sweet, cloyingly optimistic view of the world is simply dishonest. This show just has a wrongheaded idea of what heroism even means, and this is nowhere near the only toxic message it has to offer.<br />
<br />
In life, you learn from your mistakes by enduring the shame, defeat, and loss which they bear, and only after examining and confronting these consequence of your own actions and shortcomings do you get back on your feet and win. My Hero Academia, however, operates by the logic of participation trophies. Nothing is achieved through genuine determination, and anything which is, is undercut by rendering the determination unnecessary through extenuating circumstances which would’ve led to a net gain either way. Even if he loses the tournament, he’s sent to train with the best teacher. Even if the class is defeated by the villains, no one dies, is taken hostage, or seriously endangered. Even if his ridiculously overpowered ability comes at a physical cost, it’s always healed instantly. In this world of heroes and villains, what defines you isn’t how talented you are or how powerful your quirk is, it’s about hard work, spirit, and the willingness to help others against all odds—only it’s not, because he wouldn’t even be a hero if there wasn’t hidden rules back in the original exam during season one. It’s portrayed as if Midoriya’s hard work and benevolent intentions were what made him worthy of All Might’s powers after he trained for a few months—fuck anyone who’s been doing so for their entire life, am I right?—but you have to realize he began training only AFTER he was PROMISED THE POWER. His efforts were impure, because his reward was guaranteed. It doesn’t matter how hard he trained, because there was no risk of failure, since his self-serving reward was set in stone before he expended ANY effort. I mean, it’s not even correct to say he trained to earn the power, as much as it is to say he simply prepared for All Might to gift it to him. All Might is a teacher; this is academic favoritism. The only thing this series ever got right was Stain. My Hero Academia is generic superhero shlock, but Stain challenged the very moral bankruptcy I’ve spend the last two paragraphs detailing, taking the heroes to task for their hypocritical corporate marketing and corrupt motivations, but after the anticlimactic battle with him ends, everyone ignores the manner in which he subverted their bastardization of heroism, all the thematic underpinnings of his arc are trashed, everyone forgets the incident like nothing happened, and we all go right back to boring school-life nonsense, filler horseshit, and shounen training arcs. We’re back to square one, and we learned nothing from the only scrap of intrigue in the entire series.<br />
<br />
Season five is the epitome of everything I’ve bitched about, too, because not only does it uphold and continue to promote these fraudulent ideas of heroism, but from the plot to the characters, it’s also the worst possible incarnation of the anime in every way. I haven’t kept up with this show for years, so coming back and putting in the hard slave labor of slogging through this season was pure fucking hell. I’d heard about the broken loli waifu character who could nullify any damage Midoriya did to himself by being carried into battle with him Guilty Crown style, but gosh, who knew every other character would get this preposterous?! So apparently—SPOILERS—Shigaraki is nothing but a literally insane, edgelord school-shooter now? Wasn’t he supposed to be Big Bad #2? Why would the hack authoring this disaster remove any chance the series had at a more thoughtful, interesting villain with new and challenging ideas and instead settle for Jared Leto’s Joker? Now it’s even more threadbare and hackneyed than before—great! Since I last watched this, the power creep has seemingly reached Azathoth scale, and I don’t see how anyone is supposed to matter when a few select characters are insurmountably more powerful than everyone else. Speaking of which, these fights are still the worst of the fucking worst. Minus one or two overdone action scenes, they just exchange blows with nauseating amounts of speed lines and other bullshit to distract you from the largely embarrassing animation production at hand. Plot conveniences still favor Midoriya at every step of the way, even when you may think otherwise, and the author still resorts to excusing asspulls with non-diegetic retcons, like that time in season three when the 1,000,000% Smash wasn’t actually one million percent because the author said so on Twitter, the thing which originally made me drop the show. Even as far back as season two, Midoriya wouldn’t have been able to break the mind control during the tournament if it weren’t conveniently written in such a way his quirk could counter, and it’s no surprise they’re still pulling this shit speaking of the aforementioned power creep, because how else could they limit the main cast now that they too are overpowered if not by introducing every seemingly unbeatable power with one single little weakness which just so happens to make the character in question wildly underpowered when fighting the protagonist who the series is still for some reason treating like an underdog.<br />

For years, drooling internet shills, many of whom have been sponsored by Crunchyroll, have claimed My Hero Academia was no conventional hero story, and for years, they have been talking out of their asses. Nothing about it has ever broken the mold or subverted the expectations of anyone who’s seen anything like it, or in other words, anyone who’s seen any shounen anime in the history of existence, but unlike every other shounen anime in the history of existence, My Hero Academia is ugly. Yes, this season has particularly shitty animation, but that’s not what I’m talking about. I mean the design sense is awful. Please just take a second to think about shounen’s Big Three. Depending on the character, the designs in Bleach can be downright erotic, and it’s filled to the brim with hot babes and chad hunks. One Piece has some of the most distinctive and eye-catching designs in manga, and while Naruto’s designs aren’t exactly glamorous or creative, its color palette is at least consistent, and Tetsuya Nishio’s anime adaptation designs were outstanding. The newer hits also follow this pattern. I think everyone agrees Demon Slayer’s artwork is all it has ever had going for it in both manga and anime form, Hiro Mashima’s success is openly predicated on nothing but sex-appeal, and just look at One Punch Man. It was a cult classic when ONE was drawing it, but when Yusuke Murata began drawing it three years later with his insane digital manga detailing and irresistible women, it took the world by storm. Say what you will about these series perpetuating visual archetypes despite high-quality artwork, but Jesus Christ on a fucking bike, at least their character designs are worth advertising! BUT EVERY CHARACTER in My Hero Academia looks PANTS ON HEAD RETARDED, and forgive me for sounding so close-minded, but I simply will not entertain an argument to the contrary. They are just fucking goofy, period. Maybe, just maybe, one or two waifus are marketable, but most just look dumb, and the thoughtless coloration of the anime makes the weirder ones stand out like a sore thumb and lose any niche moe they may’ve had in manga form. Also, and I’m usually not one to complain about fanservice, but when highschool girls dress like camera sluts despite having a shy and modest personality, their whole character feels backward. I suppose it doesn’t matter, though, since even our protagonist himself is an inconsistent mess, an incongruous chimera who is both a crybaby loser who the viewer can empathize with during melodrama, and also a stone-faced alpha male they can self-insert with during hype action to satiate their trashy power fantasies.<br />

A few years ago, people began saying, “A-1 Pictures is the problem,” and I naively thought everyone was finally waking up to the issues plaguing the industry. However, since then, everyone has turned their ire toward other studios like Deen and JC Staff, because Post-Maruyama MAPPA is now guilty of everything everyone hated A-1 for, but since MAPPA also produces many of the newest fan-favorites, those same people who were rightfully decrying A-1 for their incorrigible outsourcing, absurd mismanagement, inhumane scheduling and working conditions, and cynical “quantity over quality” business model have now had to forgive and forget so they don’t sound like hypocrites when sucking up to their new favorites. I, on the other hand, have not forgotten this outrage we used to share, and in an attempt to rekindle negative attention toward these toxic business practices, I too stopped saying “A-1 Pictures is the problem,” only so I could instead start saying, “If A-1 Pictures is THE problem, then Bones is MY problem.” Like many others, Bones has sometimes engaged in these poor practices as well, of course nowhere near as much as A-1 or MAPPA, but the real reason I feel they should be maligned is different. I feel they should be maligned for manipulating their impressionable teenage, college-aged fanbase into marketing their anime for them. Don’t even worry about the complete fucking trainwrecks like their 20th Anniversary Production, Carole &amp; Tuesday, and just watch My Hero Academia, Bungou Stray Dogs, Noragami, or even some of their shit with actual artistic integrity like Captain Earth or Concrete Revolutio, and I dare you to tell me you found ANY fucking consistency therein. Sure, you’ll have a few flashy action scenes drawn by a few talented holdouts from their early Sunrise days like Yutaka Nakamura, but their background art and compositing are often pitiful, and the animation itself is atrocious outside those few action scenes. But those action scenes are more then enough, because they’ll metastasize through social media and forum sites like a cancer and infect every unsuspecting consumer they can find. Bones earned their reputation in the 2000s and early 2010s when they were just a bunch of Ex-Sunrise boys whose creative ambitions were too big for Bandai, but they saw where that creator-focused business model lead Manglobe, and they aren’t stupid. This is why I call it a me problem and not a real problem, because not only is it silly to slap a label on entire studios when many have constantly changing staff, constantly restructured teams, constantly fluctuating budgets, and are almost always managed by corporate level business decisions which are made by production committees far above the pay grade of the actual creators working there, but also because to this day, Bones continues to produce amazing and objectively impressive works of animation. However, the prestige they justly earn from such projects goes on to unjustly ascribe prestige to other projects which look like they were fished out of a fucking pig sty, and those who’d mistake a Blue Raspberry Ring Pop for a Ten Carat Diamond Ring eat it up regardless, hailing Bones as the consistent and absolute best.<br />

According to the lovely moderation team, I’m required to make the disclaimer that I dropped season three six episodes in and didn’t watch season four. Big funny.<br />

    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
The pros of Boku no Hero Academia s5 are pretty obvious. The characters are still fun, well developed quirks, worldbuilding, etc. Storywise there&#039;s not so much so far. The art and sound are still fine to me. Whatever.<br />
<br />
I just want to focus on the bad parts of s5 mostly. The class A vs B story arc sounds pretty fun in concept. Here&#039;s my problems with it though. (The first fight has less problems than the second in my opinion).<br />
1. Everyone is still describing everything to the viewer as if everyone watching is a toddler. We can see the action on screen and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395540">
        we have the power of inference. We don&#039;t need a play by play of literally everything that&#039;s happening. <br />
2. Drawn out fights. Every fight between class A and B is looking like its gonna take 2 episodes which is absolutely ridiculous. Most of it is just useless information and filler of random characters talking slowly.<br />
3. Character relationships. I used to ship todomomo a lot, but this ship has gotten really bland. Momo is still way too timid and shows no personality progression. She develops confidence as a leader but still not in herself. Todoroki cares about her feelings and her plans even though there isn&#039;t any banter between them. Apparently there is some in the manga but it was cut out of the anime which is stupid because it&#039;s important to show why does he care so much. <br />
4. Stupid actions and plot convenience. Momo&#039;s quirk is overpowered. She just doesn&#039;t do anything with it as usual. She makes bulky weapons like a cannon just to launch a bag over a wall. After her usefulness for the episode is done, she just lets Kendo knock her out. I like to imagine anime stuff in my head since I have an imagination. And by far the most I&#039;ve done it is with Bnha. Mostly to imagine Todoroki being overpowered or highly choreographed fight scenes. But another thing I like to do is fix dumb mistakes. Like I don&#039;t know... Momo making a taser to I don&#039;t know... incapacitate THE OPPONENT.  <br />
5. Other random stuff. Class B is a lot more bloodthirsty than class A in this training arc for some reason. Tokoyami gets choked by a mushroom while he is too nice to knock out his opponent (dark shadow just stands there and watches). Momo is literally internally apologizing to Kendo as she is getting her ass kicked.<br />
<br />
Hopefully these problems get resolved later in the season.

    To say I was going into the 5th season of My Hero Academia with high expectations would be an understatement. Even though I’m not a My Hero Academia enthusiast or even a fan for that matter, I can wholeheartedly say that this season of My Hero Academia was supposed to be the series game-changer and tone shifter. The 5th season was supposed to set My Hero Academia in a new and more compelling direction. A direction that would’ve brought My Hero Academia’s writing to a new height because of the fascinating and enchanting thematic value that it has to offer. As the egregious season has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418207">
        finally encroach to its end, I can say that the changes the anime made will devalue and potentially destroy the story that Kouhei Horikoshi originally intended to tell. <br />
<br />
The anime only had one job: Adapt the source material faithfully and bring the spirit of the manga onto the screen. The studio behind the anime has done it before and is capable of doing it, but they purposely dragged out the pacing of the first arc to this season just so enough time is given for a non-canon side film. The second half of the season was pretty much filler content mixed in with minuscule canon manga materials, which ultimately created an unnecessary mess that the future installment must clarify later on. The choice of dragging things out and making changes to the narrative structure ruined how the future narrative will play out. <br />
<br />
You could advocate that I should evaluate the 5th season of My Hero by excluding my knowledge of the source material. But that would, in my eyes, be doing a massive disservice to myself. And in no way that I’m comfortable in doing so. Furthermore, I’m dubious that even people with absolutely no knowledge of the source material have praises for this season alone. <br />
<br />
Honestly, there’s really nothing else to expand on because everything is just pointless. There’s little to no driving force in its narrative, nor was the season even entertaining. The 5th installment of My Hero was just a filler. Skipping the 5th season and you’ll miss nothing. At this point, I’m just hoping My Hero Academia will continue to fade into obscurity because the previous installments aren’t much better.

    It&#039;s 2021 and we can call My Hero Academia a major franchise among Shounen Jump&#039;s IPs. While it may not be the single biggest hit of the decade, it does challenge the Big Three with its cult following. That doesn&#039;t mean MHA is a masterpiece franchise just because it&#039;s popular. In fact, MHA may be one of more controversial anime this year.<br />
<br />
My Hero Academia is a franchise that needs no introduction at this point. It&#039;s been an established franchise for years and we all came to know the heroes and villains that makes up its roster. For any long time fan, MHA has also explored

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418206">
        the hero society and dark underworld of the villains league. What if I told you we get to see an in depth look at both sides? Season 5 may have a more expanded character roster and plot but that doesn&#039;t always translate into a better show overall.<br />
<br />
From the first half of Season 5, we are once again reintroduced to Class 1-A with some of its most prominent characters such as Deku, Bakugo, Todoroki, among others. Their primary rivals are Class 1-B where they compete in a series of matches. To put it simply, it&#039;s a battle of pride and respect on the line. While Class 1-B&#039;s character roster is nowhere near as prominent as Class 1-A, there are still some important members to take notice. Among them include Itsuka, Ibara, and Tetsutetsu. Some of these almost represent mirror images of Class 1-A such as Shihai when compared to Tetsutetsu. On the other hand, it&#039;s hard to root for Class 1-B due to their limited screen time and lack of development. Instead, the season decided to throw them in to showcase their abilities against Class 1-A to see which side is more dominant. <br />
<br />
When that&#039;s out of the way, Season 5 also decided that Deku needs more training to improve himself. So what does that lead to? It means training with none other than Endeavor. Deku, Bakugo, and Todoroki decides to all participate to improve themselves. Meanwhile, it appears that Endeavor knows when the Meta Liberation Army will strike so it&#039;s a chance to prepare everyone for the inevitable battles. While this all seems well structured on the surface, the season decided to drag its pacing by showcasing more of Todoroki&#039;s past, specifically his family. As if we didn&#039;t know enough already, the anime really pushes the envelope to show the type of man Endeavor is. It becomes an oversaturated character study where we just want to move on from the past. Let&#039;s face it, we know enough about Todoroki for who he is. It&#039;s freaking Season 5 already.<br />
<br />
But perhaps the most intruging part of Season 5 is the side of the villains. Specifically, I&#039;m talking about the League of Villain led by Tomura Shigaraki. As one of the most prominent characters in the entire franchise, his dark past is explored in detail from his childhood. It casts a shadow of how a once seemingly innocent kid becomes the gruesome villain he is today. He&#039;s not the only one we feast our eyes on either as the Villains gets their background stories told that includes Toga and Twice. It&#039;s important to understand their origins as the show wants us to experience the dark side of MHA. If you ask me, &quot;My Villain Academia&quot; is the best thing to happen this season.<br />
<br />
We&#039;re in a timeline where every year, MHA makes its presence felt. I say with confidence now that Bones and the directors will adapt the rest of the manga to the dawn of time, for when it ends, so shall the anime. That doesn&#039;t mean MHA managed to live up to the hype all this time though. And in fact, the next season will have a lot of work to do if it wants to regain its former glory.

    This season starts off well, but leaves you in a spot of feeling like this is going to be a filler based on other long term anime. I was tricked too and picked it back up after 2 months. This season is getting really juicy and goes further into details in regards to &quot;One for All&quot; as well as some soon to be big fights. Stick around through the initial match ups for Deku&#039;s fight. TRUST me! It gets good and the whole story is starting to unravel.... You could technically skip a few episodes, but I don&#039;t want to spoil anything.

    Season five of MHA is here, and while I do personally enjoy the series, I do have to say that it might be within your best interests to wait for the series to either be finished, or wait until a few episodes have come out in order to progress with it. Not to say it&#039;s bad, but more that it at current stage, may take weeks to really go somewhere. Even if you understand the plot, understand what it&#039;s doing. Even then, it can be quite tiresome. <br />
<br />
I normally don&#039;t fully agree with the idea that &#039;Read the manga it&#039;s better&#039; type of deal, as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395518">
        I do feel like the anime can stand on it&#039;s own merit. But even now, I&#039;d say it&#039;d be better for you to go read the manga to get further within the story, rather than waiting for the current stuff to start progressing faster then the pace it currently is doing so.<br />
<br />
Not saying the story is bad, as I wouldn&#039;t discredit what it&#039;s trying to do currently, as it can be interesting for some, but for others, it can just get a tad bit repetitive, and making you have to wait a fair few weeks until it&#039;s over with, so you can finally see whats upcoming next more than anything. But if you&#039;re wondering if to pick this up and start watching it weekly, it might be ideal for you to wait until things start picking up. Right now, it&#039;s a bit of a slow burn. With I&#039;m sure things will start getting better later on.<br />
<br />
As for everything else? Can&#039;t really say much of a bad word about it. MHA&#039;s animation, art style, and sound design as always been stellar, and a real good thing about the show. While some shows are lacking in areas, MHA always brings it out really well when it comes in that area. Or least does a real good job within this department. <br />
<br />
The characters are also another part that keeps the interest within this show. After all, we&#039;ve seen most of them for four seasons now, and I&#039;m sure, the more we see, the more development we&#039;ll get. It&#039;ll only get better from there. Say what you will about these characters. Where they&#039;d be written bad or good, but they very much stand out a ton, in many departments. <br />
<br />
MHA is far more enjoyable if you binge it honestly, I&#039;d say watch it if you want to keep up with it, but if you wanna wait, then that&#039;s more than a good idea also.

    The fifth season of Boku No Pico Academia is finally here. Welp, I guess it&#039;s now time for me to review this thing.<br />
<br />
This review will have some spoilers BUT THERE WON&#039;T BE ANY BIG SPOILERS SO NO WORRIES :D.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t even know why I called them spoilers; the stuff I&#039;ll be mentioning are so little I can really just say this review is spoiler free.<br />
<br />
Before we start, for those people who are too lazy to read I made a very short version at the end. Just scroll all the way to the end for it.<br />
<br />
All right let&#039;s get straight to it !<br />
<br />
!!! Here&#039;s a recap

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418208">
        of bnha !!! (You can skip this if you want to get straight to bnha s5&#039;s review)<br />
<br />
Boku No Hero Academia (My Hero Academia) takes place in a world where 80% of the human population have quirks, special abilities that varies from being able to make explosions to being a freaking seal. Because of this, people have used these quirks to commit evil crimes, these people are known as villains. The people who use their quirks against evil are known as heroes. Our sad main protagonist, Izuku Midoriya, was unfortunately part of the sad 20% of people who didn&#039;t have any quirks, these people are known as quirkless people. Nevertheless he still strived to be a hero until one day after he almost got devoured by a slime. The number 1 hero, All Might, a hero who smiles even in times of trouble, a hero so strong you can see his abs through the costume, chose Midoriya as the 9th wielder of One For All, a quirk passed down from generation to generation, accumulating power and different quirks from previous wielders. After long training, Midoriya, longing to be like the number 1 hero All Might, enrolls to U.A. Highschool, an academy made for heroes, and ends up breaking all the bones in his body multiple times, gets targetted by multiple terrorist groups, unlocks super saiyan, breaks all of his bones again, defeats a freaking drug lord, and almost evaropated into nothing because a child he rescued.<br />
<br />
The story idea is amazing. The anime isn&#039;t though.<br />
<br />
!!! bnha recap !!!<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
<br />
Boku No Pico Academia&#039;s 5th season (I&#039;ll try my best to not spoil a lot -- If you really don&#039;t want any spoilers then just skip this criteria) starts with the events following Hawks (no. 2 hero very hawt guy) and Endeavor&#039;s (no. 1 hero who&#039;s just tryna have a family again) battle against a Nomu (Monster-like humans with multiple quirks created with All For One). We see Endeavor, with him being the new number 1 hero, a whole lot in this season. The first major part of the season is a series of battles with class A and B. Just before this series of battles, Deku recieves a vision of the previous One For All members. During one of the battles, having received the same vision, Deku Manifests a new quirk! I only included the first major part and non-key info of this season to avoid spoiling anything :D <br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
<br />
Boku No Pico Academia&#039;s animation for this fifth season was very consistent. There weren&#039;t any episodes that was poorly made and there weren&#039;t any episodes that I would say better than others. bnha&#039;s animation overall is pretty great, but I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s just me or the animation was better during the previous seasons and I don&#039;t really see anything in the animation that really surprises me. I don&#039;t really see any reason why I should give their art a 9. I don&#039;t really have much to say about their animation. IT&#039;S GREAT OKAY IT&#039;S JUST I DON&#039;T HAVE THE WORDS RIGHT NOW. ALL RIGHT MOVING ON!<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
<br />
Just like their art, there aren&#039;t much to say about Boku No Pico Academia&#039;s sound LOL. I don&#039;t really see anything bad nor do I see anything that great? Oooo but I really like the first ending song it&#039;s very catchy and the rest of the openings and endings are pretty good too. I PERSONALLY DON&#039;T LIKE THE SECOND OPENING; I EVEN SKIP IT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE -- please don&#039;t kill me -- . Voice acting and sound fx all sound pretty natural. Like I said nothing much to say. <br />
<br />
Okey it&#039;s time for the characters; I&#039;m very excited for this one.<br />
<br />
Character: 5<br />
<br />
One thing I don&#039;t like about Boku No Pico Academia -- I should really stop calling it that -- is that there&#039;s WAY too many characters. The amount of characters that show up in my screen is more than the history terms I have to memorize for my finals. Come on do you really expect me to memorize all of them??? Since there&#039;s more bnha characters than the sands of the earth, we barely know anything about the characters. There isn&#039;t just enough time to properly introduce every single one; that&#039;s why we only have surface level information for everyone. MOST SCREENTIME DOESN&#039;T EVEN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE PLOT SINCE THEY&#039;RE SO BUSY SHOWING A FLASHBACK FOR SOME CHARACTER I DON&#039;T EVEN CARE ABOUT OR MAYBE TOO BUSY WITH SHOWING US TODOROKI&#039;S FAMILY ISSUES. * Ehem * Forgive me; I got carried away. Because of bnha&#039;s large collection of characters, character development is also very slow. It took Bakugo 5 seasons to learn that a hero&#039;s job is to save people and 5 seasons to know that team work makes the dream work. LIKE BRU- ALSO DEKU WHEN THE HECK ARE YOU GONNA REALIZE SOMEONE HAS A HUGE CRUSH ON YOU AND MY GIRL WHEN ARE YOU GONNA CONFESS?? Also Tetsuo please forgive your dad (Mr. Endeavor San aka no. 1 hero) I know it&#039;s hard, but he&#039;s trying his best to have a family again; so please forgive him. Once again, because bnha has more characters than the members of every isekai main character&#039;s harem have, everyone doesn&#039;t have much of a personality. I CAN SUM UP MOST OF EVERYONE&#039;S PERSONALITY IN SEASON 5 IN ONE SENTENCE WATCH ME.<br />
<br />
Deku: I HAVE TO GET STRONGER TO BECOME #1 HERO * cries * <br />
<br />
Iida: THERE IS NO POINT IN GETTING SAD- LET&#039;S ALL MOVE ON AND TRAIN TO GET STRONGER. PLUS ULTRA !!!!<br />
<br />
Bakugo: LOL noob ur never passing me just go die and go straight to hell idc about ur silly dreams. go to hell.<br />
<br />
Mr. Endeavor San: SHOOOTOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!! #AllMight_kinda_noob #I_wanna_have_a_family_again <br />
<br />
Todoroki: Frick u dad.<br />
<br />
Ochako: OH MY LORD I JUST HUGGED DEKU KUN AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG<br />
<br />
Midnight: AWWWW OMG U GUYS ARE SO CUTE HOW ADORABLE !!!!! UWU !!!!!<br />
<br />
Those may not be very accurate, but you know what I mean right? They all have one-dimension personalities. There are really just too much characters and because of that, bnha characters aren&#039;t very special. Most Boku No Pico Academia male characters only exist for gay ships and all the girls for ----- well you knowww. Don&#039;t get me wrong I don&#039;t dislike bnha&#039;s characters; I actually like them, since I relate to some of them in a way, but hear me out. THERE ARE JUST TOO MUCH BOKU NO PICO ACADEMIA CHARACTERS.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t enjoy Boku No Pico Academia. I started watching bnha, because my former bestfriend asked me to watch it and since I&#039;ve already seen seasons 1-4, I might as well watch season 5 too. I personally believe bnha is made for a younger audience -- I MYSELF IS NOT OLD OKAY IM REFERRING TO TEENS AND PRETEENS --. It doesn&#039;t make sense though, since there are uh. How do I explain. * ehem * Midnight * ehem * Mountain Lady * ehem * Momo Yaoyarazu -- I don&#039;t know if I spelled that correctly --. YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN. As I was saying, I believe bnha was made for preteens. Most jokes aren&#039;t even funny (for me atleast) and rather childish (yes I just said childish). Some jokes are just very overused. Stuff like deku talking a lot and being a complete nerd; blabbing a lot of crap that no one cares about and people making him shut up used to be funny, BUT IT&#039;S BEEN 5 SEASONS LET&#039;S TRY UH OTHER THINGS PERHAPS? Also Kacchan being loud and disrespectful used to be really funny but It&#039;s getting kind of annoying to be honest. Now for fight scenes. I used to love Boku No Pico academia&#039;s fight scenes. I honestly don&#039;t know why anymore. I don&#039;t know why I ever loved their fight scenes. bnha battles are just 60% side characters stating the obvious facts about the battle, 20% chit chat between the people fighting , 10% screaming &quot;IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?&quot;, 5% shouting the names of their ultimate moves and 5% actual fighting. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I actually enjoy battles from shounen animes it&#039;s just I don&#039;t like side characters that I don&#039;t care about talk about the battle. IT&#039;S AWKWARD. Another thing is bnha&#039;s very slow plot pacing. It&#039;s so extremely slow and because of that I don&#039;t really find bnha that interesting anymore compared to when it was at the first two seasons. I just continue watching for the sake of finishing.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6<br />
<br />
In conclusion, Boku No Pico Academia is just another shounen anime. The only thing this anime has anything different to offer is that it&#039;s main character is a total wimp and cries a lot and this anime has infinitely more characters. LOL all jokes aside, Boku No Hero Academia is an &#039;okay&#039; anime. It has a fairly nice story and plotline with great animation and sound. To be real, great animation and music is all Boku No Hero Academia is. bnha is very overrated. If you truly love this show and this is the type of anime you enjoy, that&#039;s okay. We all have our preferences and own opinions. I don&#039;t necessarily hate bnha, but it&#039;s definitely not the anime for me. <br />

<br />
For those too lazy to read:<br />
<br />
Story: 7 <br />
Art: 8 - consistent good animation <br />
Sound: 8 - good sound. opening and ending songs are pretty good too<br />
Character: 5 - bland characters and very slow character development<br />

    A late bloomer like me got into this show when the show was at its peak when the show had already had 3 seasons, and I started the manga and the anime at the same time and I was amazed. I thought there wasn’t even going to be a show that stands up against the like of Naruto but this show proved its worth and stole the hearts of teenagers of this era. From people calling it the future of the shounen genre and the bringer of the succeeding age group, “Boku No Hero Academia” or most commonly known as “My Hero Academia”. Written and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395501">
        illustrated by Kōhei Horikoshi this is one show that needs no introduction whatsoever, a show that has seen both its fair share of both haters and lovers, from it being promoted by the makers of Naruto and being called “just a child’s shounen jump” the show has seen it all. <br />
Studio Bones as always has done a great job at the adaptation part but as a manga reading I look up to the anime visuals that bring life to characters, and somehow it feels like after every season the show is losing its edge completely.<br />
My Hero Academia is a well-made, standard shounen anime that have lived up to the expectations of many.<br />
<br />
Story ~ 6<br />
The world is set up in the future where tech is not far from our own, where many people are just born with strange superpowers and alterations and oddities. The story is as always solid but somewhat gloomy and leaden, unsustainable but pleasant. The series is dense enough to make the viewers binge the whole show in about 2 days. The story in some way has become clichéd. From a fan’s view, this show has become way predictable and even more dreary and boring. As the show has always been, it focuses on the lives of students who train themselves to fend off super-powered corruption as specialized vigilantes and the show has been the same since. Unlike other shows like One Piece, The Promised Neverland (Season 1 and the Manga), Dr. Stone, Black Clover, and Blue Exorcist the premise of the show hasn’t changed much in these upcoming years and staying true to its storyline and unlike One Punch Man, it does not critique the concept of protectors and hero’s because it doesn’t really need to.<br />
<br />
Animations ~ 8<br />
The animations for the show have never let people down whether it be fight scenes or showing emotions they are impressively animated. Studio Bones does a phenomenal job at putting up with such clean and crisp visuals in its fight scenes showcasing itself as a powerhouse when it some to animations and art style from the makers of the studio that gave us the sweet and extraordinary FMAB (Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood), Ouran Host Club, Soul Eater and Mob Psycho 100, I expected nothing less, as they’ve always undergone a superfluous mile in their adaptations. The movements and show boarding of characters are more than impressive as they are drawn so vividly but some scenes show feel a little left behind as well as it gets messier and more intense which is a little painful to the eyes. However, there are other hero’s at the academy that the show visualizes that pick up the pace and the series is not bound to any infinite range of wacky story and pacing.<br />
<br />
Sound ~ 7<br />
The music for “Boku No Hero Academia” has always been uplifting and this season’s opening is no different from the previous ones as it stands out again “No. 1” by DISH. Although I like the ending more “Footprints” by the Peggies is a classic that sticks like a symphony in the mind, nothing short of “The Peggies ” although, I’ll always prefer “The Day” by Porno Graffiti as one of the best openings of the show.<br />
<br />
Character ~ 7<br />
Though the anime slams the nails when it comes to tough character designs out of the gate, the story revolves around the main character Izuku MIdoriya or Deku who’s not born with powers much like Asta’s from “Black Clover”. He is feeble, frail, and timid, who unlike the other characters yearns with every inch of his might to save people with just a grin and smile, like his idol “All Might”. ‘All Might’ who’s your classic anime superman justice campaigner, who is super strong and gifted with uncanny fortitude and is the world’s greatest hero. Instead of fighting with our main protagonist, he chooses him as a successor of his. Deku’s main thing is breaking through his psychosomatic barriers and physical boundaries to win by the skin of his teeth, and the message that the show delivers every time that “children have the power to change, remake and save the world.” Still remains.  <br />
    <br />
Overall ~ 6<br />
At the end of the day is indeed beautiful, though it has become shallow and predictable. From its first debut in 2016 my Hero Academia has been a huge success all over the world mostly around North America and the western parts of the world. The only thing keeping the show from dying is the sheer ubiquity of how big the franchise has become. A lot of people still love this series and me being one of them but one way or another I just don’t want to keep up with the anime anymore as I did before when the show was at its best in the prior seasons. Taking a look at the bigger picture, I realized how ordinary and unpretentious the show has become, it is undeniably overhyped like many other shows but it has its sincerity as well and it deserves almost most of it. I personally think the show is a huge accomplishment and has achieved so much all across the world but in the recent season I just don’t see it, and I sigh at the foundation of what the show could’ve become and not how much it has accomplished.   <br />
If you’re looking for big emotional changes and fights and scenes where young boys put all their spirits into fists for the sake of honor and to make their dreams come true of being the best and fighting with their Nakamas, this show is definitely for you. <br />

    It&#039;s just a big 25 episodes long filler <br />
<br />
Story: Almost nothing happens here. First half of the season is just a sparring session to remind you that some characters actually exist. In the second hald we are getting some backstories and rushed way of expandance of the &quot;bad guys&quot; group.<br />
<br />
Art: Nothing speacial. Even worse than previous seasons.<br />
<br />
Sound: It&#039;s fine.<br />
<br />
Character: &quot;Good&quot; characters are trying to kind of improve and learn new techniques but there is nothing interesting tbh. There is only one mildly interesting improvement from MC.<br />
Main &quot;bad guy&quot; will become overpowered towards the end of the season without any actual reason.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: This anime is getting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409697">
        worse and worse with every season. If you don&#039;t want to miss this season so much just watch it in 2x speed.<br />
<br />
Overall: strong 1 to light 2.

    Since i see a lot of comments and rewievs about this show being childish and getting boring and stuff i just want to adress something in my review of SEASON 5.<br />
<br />
<br />
Almost all the shonen shows you like don&#039;t go where My Hero Academia goes to: INTRODUCING EVERY CHARACTER AND SHOWING THEM GROW BOTH IN MIND AND BODY!<br />
<br />
This arc of the 5th season may be NOT AS ENTARTAINING AS some very high stakes arcs BUT it&#039;s essential to the STORY OF MY HERO ACADEMIA! It&#039;s showing how all the characters are improving their line of thinking and how they are honing their skills. The writer of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review398955">
        this story is showing you how everyone in this story matters to some degree and is giving most of them a chance to shine. Yeah he can go develop only Midoriya and carry on with the story, BUT NO! He shows you REAL CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT of MCs, Side Characters, Villains and others. <br />
<br />
NOT EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE A HIGH STAKES FIGHT.Yeah those kind of fights give all of them an example of where their place is right now, but what happens after that, what will they do, how will they improve, do they even want to improve? MHA is showing you how all the characters are improving to be able to help or be a BIG PART of those HIGH STAKES FIGHTS that will come after.<br />
<br />
SEASON 5 is really good people it is giving everyone&#039;s character development and showing their &quot;improvement&quot;. It is good and it will continue to be good.

    As a big fan of bnha manga I&#039;m just disappointed. The artstyle in the manga is always progressing and is accurate to the things that are happening in the story, it&#039;s not longer so cutesy like before. The anime artstyle is still stuck in the mood of season 1, the colors are too bright, everything seem so weird, I can&#039;t feel anything when sad or important things are happening, it just seems like a caricature. Or maybe I FEEL smth but then it&#039;s cringe. If they animate the now latest chapters in this style I think I might just die of laughter. Please don&#039;t.

    Class A vs Class IdontcareB should have been skipped. Doesn&#039;t do anything to move the plot forward, the entire thing seems like a filler arc. As a Boku no hero fan who only watches the anime I&#039;m very disappointed because this feels pretty much like a wasted season and I&#039;ll have to wait a lot for the next one.<br />
<br />
They have gone through much better training arcs in past seasons, not everything has to be high stakes but going with no stakes for an entire arc is just mind-boggling to me.<br />
<br />
And as a wise man once said: If you don&#039;t like my opinion about this show,

    *Writing after seeing up to episode 11 of the 5th season*<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve seen a lot of people debate over this season. I started watching My Hero when it was about halfway through the second season. I&#039;ve been following it as much as I could since then; I love it. From what I&#039;ve read, a lot of people are torn on this season. Some say it&#039;s boring and bad, and others say it&#039;s far from the worst arc of the series. I believe that this season does what MHA does best, and that is character development. This arc shows so many characters and how hard they&#039;ve worked

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401187">
        to become stronger. It may not have that &quot;bad guy vs good guy&quot; feel to it like the other seasons (so far) but it doesn&#039;t mean the action isn&#039;t great. There&#039;s so much thought to the strategy of each team and how they work together. Also, towards the later parts of the first half, there&#039;s some BIG developments for a main character. I think that this season has been great so far, and I can&#039;t wait to see where it goes.

    I originally intended this season to be my &quot;test season&quot; of whether or not I would finally gather the courage to drop My Hero Academia, and I couldn&#039;t even make it 7 episodes before finally recognizing that this show was always going to be a burden to watch and if I hadn&#039;t found joy in it since Season 3 then there was no way that it was going to improve for me. I finally feel free after all these years.<br />
<br />
I never understood the hype of My Hero Academia. I thought the first two seasons were standard, and the third I got a little more interested

          <span style="display: none;" id="review398327">
        in, but by the end of the third season and throughout the fourth season I just found myself not caring much for the show, if I ever had at all. There are too many characters for anyone to get development, Deku goes through the same character arc every season, and by God, I am tired of watch 12 episode long tournament arcs where NOTHING happens. That&#039;s what finally pushed me to drop this show so early on. The tournament arc that&#039;s currently happening in Season 5.<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me what merit this tournament has or story relevance? I have no idea how it fits into any plotlines or character arcs besides just drawing out another useless and repetitive plot for 12 episodes to show off various superhero powers. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve heard that the story gets better after this tournament, but you know what, I don&#039;t care anymore. I haven&#039;t cared about My Hero Academia in a LONG time, if EVER, and I don&#039;t want to force myself to watch 25 minute episodes where I&#039;m utterly bored and usually scrolling on my phone, as if watching MHA is some ungodly chore. I&#039;ve never understood the hype of this show, and I don&#039;t intend to stick around to look for improvements. I&#039;m glad to finally be free of this franchise, and I look forward to never having to think of it again.<br />

    I am here to give a patient review on the latest season of MHA. In my opinion, verdicts need to be kept until a season&#039;s completion, so let this be a 10-episode-in update that lets you know that, dammit, they&#039;ve done it again. Just as you think the plot is cooling and taking a slower pace on as the anime matures, they hit you with some ridiculously hype episode that puts a whole new layer over this anime. This latest episode was groundbreaking. If anything, watch the first 9 episodes just so that you can enjoy the pure bliss that follows.<br />
<br />
Sure, we could argue that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review400877">
        they could have fitted the first 9 episodes into half as many episodes as they did. But then I honestly would not have appreciated episode 10 nearly as much. I cannot tell you what the rest of the season is going to hold, but I can tell what it feels like. It feels like MHA season 5 is going to be a contender for the best anime of the year.

    As of right now MHA is at its peak of dryness. I binged the first 4 seasons before season 5 started so I could enjoy the hype, but I was very disappointed. Other than introducing us to characters we&#039;ve known for 4 seasons; the season started of strong with the first 2 episodes...then it was all downhill after that. There&#039;s still 19 episodes to go so I&#039;m hoping that it gets better because I had high expectations and I&#039;ve heard a lot of good things about the manga. But to be honest I expect this season to be a 7 at best.

    MHA always has, and always will be, mid (at best). As a show that plays its cards incredibly safe and doesn’t try to subvert anything in the shounen genre, it’s pretty clear what MHA hopes to achieve in its lifetime (that’s selling movies if you haven’t realized already). But this season just goes to show that when you aim for mediocrity, you end up with subpar results. Drill that lesson into your hearts kids: aim for the moon so you can land amongst the stars, don’t be like MHA and aim for the stratosphere and end up 2m from where you started.<br />
<br />
If you have any

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418251">
        hope left for this series, I suggest you abandon it and save yourself from disappointment. This season alone indicated where Bones’ priorities lie with this series as a whole (movies so stonks go up). <br />
<br />
As with any MHA season, we can’t go without the classic flaws:<br />
1. Disgustingly long episode recaps<br />
2. Piss-poor pacing/storyboarding<br />
3. Unironically lengthy exposition dumps<br />
4. Lack of meaningful progress on character development and worldbuilding<br />
<br />
Let’s see how these flaws manifested this season.<br />
<br />
The 1st episode is a “why do you exist” episode. Was it necessary to reintroduce every character and their quirks and dynamics? It’s not as if we had sudden amnesia and forgot. Don’t hit me with the “it’s a chance to showcase side characters” too because you and I both know damn well that anyone who isn’t the main cast (Deku, Todoroki, Bakugo, Uraraka) has been completely shoved to the side at this point. And that’s one thing I never liked about MHA, the character development. It tries too hard to sprinkle in development for side characters, but since it’s done so half-heartedly it just feels like cheap filler content instead of a meaningful attempt at doing something. Either do something properly or don’t do it at all.<br />
<br />
The 1st cour. Class A vs Class B. Good animation for some of the scenes, but it’s wasted on content with poor pacing. The fights are overly drawn out, with each episode opening with a 5-minute flashback to the previous episode (I kid you not, EP 6 literally recycles the same recap from a previous episode). There’s also an issue of worldbuilding here with Class B, but I’m not going to open up that can of worms here. Ultimately, I don’t get how Class A, which has more real-world fighting and interning experience, decides to go easy and get their ass handed when it comes to “being aggressive” (Tokoyami vs Mushroom girl for example). The copious amounts of exposition dumps we got throughout this arc were dumbfounding too. MHA, and most anime in general, could do well to have faith in their viewers having more than 1 brain cell and an attention span greater than that of a goldfish. <br />
<br />
The 2nd cour. Hero work studies and MVA. Overall, the content here is much more interesting and watchable than 1st cour. Issues still plague the season such as--<br />
<br />
OH MY GOD OKAY IT’S HAPPENING, EVERYONE STAY CALM! STAY FUCKING CALM! WE’RE HAVING ANOTHER MHA MOVIE!!!! OMG! POGGERS! HERE’S AN ENTIRE “FILLER” EPISODE DEDICATED TO PROMOTING AND TEASING THIS MOVIE FOR Y’ALL BECAUSE THAT&#039;S JUST WHAT YOU WANTED. WE TOTALLY DIDN’T SWITCH THE STORY AND PACING UP JUST FOR THE MOVIE!!!!!<br />
<br />
Anyways, where was I? Oh yes. The same issues from cour 1 resurface here. Pacing, and now more so storyboarding too. Why were MVA and the work-study arc rearranged to the way it was presented in the show? So they could fit in the movie episode. Now we have this disjointed storyline that robs the viewer of any sense of suspense or danger. You teased Shigaraki powering up? That’s cool, but I’ve forgotten about it since nothing related is brought up again for the next 5 episodes. PLF is going to attack in 4 months with 100k plus members? Spooky. But numbers don’t mean shit to me. Giving names is. Telling me PLF has 5-6 elite villains, with quirks doing XYZ, who teamed up with the League of Villains, who also powered up, is infinitely more dramatic and suspenseful than the route we got. Not to mention awkward directing and cutting of relevant material during MVA itself. Shame on the studio. <br />
<br />
Overall, this season was a shitshow, but for different reasons than S4. The main complaint with S4 was the animation: MHA will always have copious amounts of exposition dumps. But this season, we’ve traded (somewhat) better animation for god-awful pacing and storyboarding. While there were a few bright spots and well-adapted scenes, it’s not enough to make up for a wholly disappointing season overall. It’s also been made pretty clear that all the MHA franchise cares about at this point is pumping out movies to milk the unfortunate die-hard fans of their money. Smoge.<br />
<br />
I’m not going to spoil future seasons, but all I can say is they do a great job of highlighting MHA’s biggest and most glaring flaw: god-awful worldbuilding and character development. If you’re a manga reader and would like to hear my views, shoot me a message. But all I can offer to anime-only fans is this: if you’re ready for braindead action boom-boom pow scenes, you’re in for a treat. But MHA as you know it will be dead after the next arc thanks to shitty writing.<br />

    The 5th season of MHA is quite possibly the biggest waste of time I&#039;ve ever had to endure as an anime fan, and I watched all of the 2nd season of Promised Neverland. I made this account just to review this awful season, I have truly had enough of this shit but I know that I&#039;ll somehow be sucked back into watching every new episode despite the fact this show has nothing going for it. It&#039;s terrible what this anime has done to me, even though I know it&#039;s a waste of time and that everything I&#039;ve seen so far in this show doesn&#039;t take

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411773">
        it above generic shonen anime I keep coming back to it. With that intro out the way I&#039;ll get into why I hate this season.<br />
<br />
[SPOILERS]<br />
<br />
Story: 2/10<br />
Most of every episode so far feels like pointless filler, not even including the actual pointless filler episode. I don&#039;t expect much from action anime tbh, just some interesting characters and a cohesive story with decent fights is enough to hold me over, but after 5 fucking seasons there has been little to nothing in terms of character growth, story progression or even time progression itself ffs. How the hell are they still in their first year as students after 5 seasons. The first 10 or so episodes are full of pointless fights between Class A and Class B. Most of the characters in Class A barely get looked at but now they have to compete with the even less present Class B for screentime? Not to mention that none of the fights had any actual importance to them, the biggest thing to happen from this arc was the black tentacles coming out of Deku&#039;s ass. Following these painfully drawn out fights we get an actual fiiller episode of the girl characters at the beach. That&#039;s right a beach episode, the creators of this anime just can&#039;t help themselves in wanting to waste your time. After this meaningless episode we move onto another weak arc. To sum it up the main 3 of Deku, Todoroki, and Bakugo learn some shit from Endeavor and move on. It also includes Todoroki&#039;s family situation which we already knew most of. Fairly pointless season so far and with only 7 episodes left I&#039;ll be amazed if they actually do anything meanwhile with those episodes.<br />
<br />
Art: 4/10<br />
This might be the laziest season yet in terms of animation, most of the fights have felt lackluster and boring visually. Guess they&#039;re putting all their resources into that movie that they&#039;re making.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10<br />
This is one of the biggest disappointments for me, I&#039;ve enjoyed a lot of the past seasons&#039; openings and endings, this season&#039;s have been nothing more than average.<br />
<br />
Character: 2/10<br />
MHA has never had good characters in truth, but it&#039;s just become increasingly annoying how one dimensional most of them are. Not to mention the overabundance of them. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1/10<br />
The least enjoyable season of MHA and something that makes me want to drop the show all together. I held out for large parts of this season because I had friends tell me how great the upcoming arc was going to be and at this point I doubt we&#039;ll get it this season. There is no enjoying this season left for me, not after having 2/3 of it be essentially meaningless fluff with mind-numbing episodes each week. <br />
<br />
I got into this anime around when the 3rd season started, I had some hopes that maybe it could prove to be a great show, but how foolish I was. This season has broken me, and at this point it&#039;s almost drug-like how I know how terrible this anime is for me but I just keep coming back to it out of habit.

    Four season and five years ago, studio Bones brought forth on this world a new anime, My Hero Academia, conceived with good animation, fun fights, and an enjoyable premise. Unfortunately, the intrigue has worn thin with the arrival of MHA season 5.  <br />
<br />
For my reviews, I will dissect my opinion into 5 crucial sections, henceforth known as napkins.  <br />
<br />
Napkin #1<br />
Story (2/10)<br />
Sadly, the internet has made the story and first third of the season not necessary. The training arc beginning the season and running nearly 10 episodes can best be described by the word pointless. We will see where the season goes from here,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402434">
        but the goal of over a third of the season can better be achieved by a text card advising viewers to go to the wiki and search the names of the characters and their abilities. <br />
<br />
Napkin #2<br />
Art (5/10)<br />
The animation quality is average in terms of battle centered anime but mainly does its job in making fights appear coherent. Although nothing special, it’s as serviceable and acceptable as any piece from Studio Bones is as a minimum. However, it seems Bones was saving budget in the first few episodes for animating the posteriors of Asui and Uraraka. <br />
<br />
Napkin #3<br />
Sound (5/10)<br />
Much like the animation, the sound is serviceable and does its part. The opening and endings are acceptable, definitely not my personal taste. Had the opening instead been, just off the top of my head, Kyouran Hey Kids!!, I would have given the sound a 9. <br />
<br />
Napkin #4<br />
The characters (2/10)<br />
My biggest issue with the season and show overall is the cast, exasperated by the fact that the initial training arc spends time re-introducing characters in the most bland and unimaginative way possible. There is no need for the narrator to yell the quirks of the cast and remind the viewer of their names, this is the FIFTH season after all. The fact that I need to be reminded of the uncreative quirks and the names of the students is less a testament to the expansive cast and more a point on how bland and forgettable the supporting cast are. Aside from Momo, Jiro, Todoroki, Bakugo, and Deku the Hallmark greeting card, I could not remember or care less about any other character. Shinso presented the most intrigue in his character conflict, but will likely be discarded for the remainder of the season as he is not hot enough for the fandom to ship.<br />
<br />
Napkin #5<br />
Enjoyment (3/10)<br />
I did not. <br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
With the napkins on the table set, we see another table in the distance, filled with amazing animation, good characters, and a far superior power system. MHA season 5 unfortunately had the honor of following a season led by Jujutsu Kaisen, likely leading to why I failed to enjoy this season to such a degree. Regardless, watch JJK instead. <br />
<br />
Score: 4/10 Passable but has problems<br />
