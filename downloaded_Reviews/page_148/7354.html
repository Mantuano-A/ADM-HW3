    TLDR; It’s good.<br />

What would be better to watch at late midnight if it wasn’t a horror story? A whole new premise that brings you amidst folklore, that’s for sure to haunt us. When I started to watch this series, I had this little butterfly tingling in my stomach that told me this one would be creepy as hell. It turns out that I was more than right. The show itself seems more than promising, in showing you the grotesque side of horror that may overwhelm or at least spur you with fear.<br />
<br />
The story is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411289">
        a collection of horror stories, one by one, with their uniqueness from each other, to show you how interesting horror stories can be. People are always afraid of something unknown to them, whether it be ghosts or mere bugs, simply because we can not stand their presence in more than one way. As for me, a little spider with bugs all around me is more than enough to make me lose half of my lifespan. Yikes! But you know, I think the series already does its job of scaring the shits out of us in a sense. If you, by chance, are being grossed out by one of its episodes, isn&#039;t that a clear sign of horror? Chuckle! Also, when you’ve delved deep into each story, you can see that every story has its own stage, brimming with the anxiety and uncertainties of one poor life. It could be something grotesque, creepy, and gross, but then again, this is actually what makes us shudder in excitement. Because the show just takes our breath away. Even when we try not to, the imagination of how scary one thing can be is already running through our minds, and the Itou Junji Collection has managed to do that scare. As the reality of the premise itself seems so unreal, we still can’t avert our eyes from the screen, completely oblivious to the fact that we are already fully captivated by its charm. In the end, the stories just keep diving deep into the path where we just wish to see more, to see how it plays until the bitter end.<br />
<br />
In all honesty, the Itou Junju Collection has already exceeded our early expectations in this series. From the curser to the victims, all played their roles so naturally in this unbelieving horror. It is like when you open a cursed Pandora box, where the feelings of pain and anguish with overall despair have been combined all together into one piece. It freaks you out to a certain level, but you simply can not help yourself to stop. As every story has a different character, it makes it more interesting to see how each of them is tossed into a pit of fear. Not to forget the monsters. They are just so hideous that they will make you feel uncomfortable at the mere sight of them. Just how ugly and creepy can it be? Hold my apple juice, because it’s truly a nightmare to behold.<br />
<br />
While the animation is not that good, it still manages to show what it means to be a horror story. On the other hand, I love the OP. It’s certainly a good and interesting work of art.<br />
<br />
As a big fan of gore/horror, I truly enjoyed this piece of animation. The shows had both upsides and downsides, but to a certain degree, they were indeed successful in presenting the horror theme. I had my share of fun, with the horror running wild, with a never-ending twist here and there. If I had to say, it is truly a work that is worthy of admiration while not being completely perfect.

    Junji Ito deserves better than this.<br />
<br />
As he is one of the most talented horror creators, I was eagerly anticipating when his work would finally be animated. It pains me to say this, but Studio Deen fucked up this adaptation big time. It was inevitable that at least one of his mangas would be adapted, and they chose to adapt dozens of his best stories. Any fan of his works would be just as hyped as I was… but as we now know, these adaptations aren’t even half as good as the originals. Even with some of his most beloved stories like Long Dreams, Tomie, House

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274730">
        of the Marionettes, and many more, it still turned out being a pile of garbage.  <br />
<br />
What’s interesting about the Junji Ito: Collection is how faithful it is to the source mangas, but simultaneously awful. I’m not saying I dislike the mangas, of what I read they’re incredibly frightening and layered with social commentary. So how can a faithful adaptation of a good manga be bad? <br />
<br />
I have two words for you, Studio Deen.<br />
<br />
Each panel of Junji Ito’s mangas is drawn with expert detail. Nothing is rushed, even the most obscure entries are passionately drawn to deeply disturb his legions of horror fanatics (I’m one of them). This guy seriously lives for his work, it’s no surprise he has risen to become one of the most revered horror creators to this day. It was inevitable that a TV anime adaptation couldn’t live up to his lofty achievements, but there was hope for it to at least do it justice with an equal amount of effort put into it. <br />
Keep in mind, anime adaptations of manga aren’t expected to be 1:1 perfect recreations. They compensate by breathing new life into the panels with animation (not Studio Deen’s strong suit). What we got from the Junji Ito: Collection is nearly a shot for shot recreation of each manga chapter, destined to disappoint fans. This adaptation comes with almost none of the detail lovingly put into the original work. Instead we get choppy animation, bland colors, ugly background art, oversimplified character designs, all with a fraction of the style and detail applied to the mangas.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem with this series isn&#039;t just that it fails to capture any of the style of the source materials, it’s that it fails to be remotely scary. A horror anime doesn&#039;t have to be terrifying at all times. Horror can come in many forms; it can get under your skin, it can disturb, disgust, linger, etc. But here… the art is so oversimplified that Ito’s horrific creations are no longer scary at all. Instead of a giant intimidating spider, we get an animatronic looking one that evokes laughter rather than the intense fear of Ito’s work. <br />
<br />
It is the worst form of an adaptation. A cheap imitation living in the shadow of something greater. However, there is one thing I can partially credit this adaptation for; sound effects. The squelching of blood, reverberating of a heartbeat, visceral slicing of flesh. The best noises are rarely used, keeping them from becoming repetitive, but it’s enough to get under your skin. For me, being moderately grossed out (oh god the pimple episode) was the extent of the ‘horror’ I found in this series. But for every good sound effect there were three mediocre ones that are either absurdly fake sounding or have just plain out poor audio quality. This quality issue extends to the subpar voice acting. Voices don’t match what you would expect of the characters on a number of occasions. And even when they do fit, they sound markedly worse than most other anime. <br />
<br />
I did actually find the Souichi chapters quite funny as some nice dark humor in between the grim chapters. His obnoxious voice, goofy stupidity, and extreme nihilism made him the most surprisingly funny demon summoners I’ve ever seen (not that the list is very long). <br />
It was quite an odd choice for them to start the first episode with a Souichi comedy chapter even if I enjoyed it. Although I didn’t mind that the show ended with one of his chapters it felt like rather than bringing out the best they can, they end on a low note. This series was marketed as horror so to see comedy like that in place of scares is a recipe for disappointment. Given the high drop rate right away, it’s clear people understood this was going nowhere fast. Anthology series are after all inconsistent by nature, it’d be unreasonable to expect perfectly equal adaptations across the board. But when you’re this blatantly not giving a shit about how the final product comes together, then I don’t feel the need to mince words on how bad the end result is. <br />
<br />
Make no mistake, not every one of Junji Ito&#039;s mangas that were adapted is great. He has written dozens of them so it&#039;s expected that not all of them would be stellar. Typically they have uneven lengths ranging from 18-2 minutes each, but typically they last half an episode. Many of the stories lack endings, fitting for the mysterious atmosphere, but annoying when every story one after the other has no definitive conclusion. Some of the stories fail to establish characters worth caring about then hinge dramatic stakes on them, while others may rely too heavily on a mysterious supernatural element leaving it difficult to connect with. In turn, draining most of the potential for scares. <br />
<br />
I was never bothered by the fact that Junji Ito’s manga doesn’t always have the most well developed of stories while reading his mangas. After all, the uncertainty of what is really occurring in the story is part of their mysterious charm. This mysterious atmosphere is usually brought on by the understated supernatural elements, which are rarely explained for the sake of simplicity. <br />
You’d think that this embracement of an underdeveloped story would work well for a two chapters per episode adaptation, sadly the pace is botched a bit too badly. The stories we get are rushed, lingering on the underdone horror spectacles much less than the mangas. Instead, this show prays that we’ll latch onto Ito’s stories to make up for the lackluster presentation. Needless to say, they’re forcing a formula onto already established works and it just does not work. <br />
<br />
There were a few things from Junji Ito’s mangas that made the transition from paper to screen decently. Junji Ito himself is quite aware of the world he lives in and provides us with thought-provoking social commentary. It never failed to give me an idea to chew on, distracting me from the show’s mediocrity. There are his constant jabs at overbearing family expectations, the pressure we put on ourselves and others, but most importantly his many criticisms of how he believes people can be shallow. <br />
<br />
I doubt anyone expected Ito Junji: Collection to be perfect, given the famous horror author Junji Ito has never had his work adapted into an anime until now. Especially given the studio adapting it is the definition of inconsistency, Studio Deen, it was very nearly dead on arrival. It didn’t help that the director of the infamous dumpster fire Diabolik Lovers was at the helm of this ship. Steering it off course and into every pitfall it could. <br />
<br />
Score Breakdown:<br />
[Story: 6/10] Mixed bag, supernaturally driven, retains social commentary.<br />
[Character: 3/10] Only goes as far to connect you to the horror, paper thin.<br />
[Art: 2/10] Janky animation, poor quality, ruins Ito’s aesthetic.<br />
[Sound: 3/10] Poor voice work, some scary sound effects, mediocre music.<br />
[Enjoyment: 3/10] Boring, rarely scary, occasionally funny.<br />
<br />
[Overall Score: 3.4/10]<br />
You were good Studio Deen! Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinju was great! Of all of the animes to put barely any effort into, why this one? A low effort cash grab like this is unfit to bear Junji Ito’s name. Don’t watch this anime, go read his mangas.

    Within the horror manga community Junji Ito is a King. The unique and atmosphere way in which he tells stories, paired with his surrealistic, almost confrontational art, has made him a household name regarding both the short story format, and the horror manga genre, some even going as far as saying he is the most influential, and subsequently the best. Admittedly, I am a huge fan and must agree, but the real question lies in whether the transition from panel to animation is as smooth as we all wish. So far, I can at least state that this collection is worthy of being titled after

          <span style="display: none;" id="review269743">
        the man himself.<br />
<br />
Story – 8<br />
As we get into some of Ito’s more famous works, I imagine they will span the length of entire episodes, but so far, they are half to three quarter episode length stories. I was surprisingly unfamiliar with a lot of the stories, and I’ve concluded it actually works to its benefit, rather than its detriment. The decision to choose some of Ito’s lesser known work is an interesting one - likely in order to save his more famous stories until the end, which I’d rather that then the other way around. By presenting the collection in this manner, it also gives viewers time to appreciate the oddness of each individual story and adds an interesting texture in the process. <br />
I like that some of these stories just boil down to “daughter turns into a doll” or “I met a creepy looking model”. While these straight-forward stories don’t work as well as they do in panel form within the manga, they work to a comparable effect, and have proven to be able to draw out tension in a similar way. I can see why some may find issues with this simpler, no-twist method of story telling, but I still think there is a lot of enjoyment to be had here, and more to come! As stated earlier, the fact that most of these works aren’t even well known, make them that much more fun to watch unfold. The more elaborate and well known Ito stories are what I came for and am most looking forward to. Thus far, they&#039;ve done a great job sprinkling them in here and there. <br />
<br />
Art/Animation – 8<br />
I&#039;ve heard discussions on Studio Deen’s attempt to imitate Ito’s highly detailed and refined line work, and it’s clear they’re still experimenting with how to make it look more natural and fluid in animation - sometimes it can add to the composition, sometimes it takes away from it. Evidently, if it works, it works really well, effectively intensifying certain scenes and making imagery more unsettling in the process. I admire the decision, and the stylistic liberties taken, as they feel like the classic early 2000s Junji Ito art style from the manga, and I think fans and new viewers alike will find a nostalgic quality to the show in that sense. The animators/designers seemingly have trouble retaining this ‘older look’ throughout, and again, there are some awkward frames and angles, but the art direction and animation are continually serviceable and appealing. Some may even argue that this could enhance the ominous aspects of the experience (Fashion model chasing scene comes to mind) and I kind of would agree as Ito’s work is known not to shy away from the unpleasant.<br />
<br />
Sound - 10<br />
Sound direction is probably the most important thing within the horror medium as it drives atmosphere and tone. A lot of the darkest, scariest moments of the episodes so far were multiplied by the excellent sound direction and I recall thinking to myself that they did a great job with it.<br />
OP and EN aren&#039;t what you&#039;d expect from a dark horror anime, but the subversion of expectations is what makes it interesting and the are serviceable as well. Perhaps a little forgettable, but only time will tell.<br />
<br />
Characters – 8<br />
This section has been included out of necessity as short horror stories don’t tend to be as heavily character driven as other stories (not to say they can’t be, but the nature of a short story is that they don’t have be reliant on the same characters throughout). With that being said, there is a good amount of attention and time that has gone into each character, their thoughts, developments, etc. Attention to detail is important and it is things of this nature that can sometimes make or break whether you actually care about what’s going on. In that sense, Junji Ito’s Collection is doing a lot of things right as I found myself caring, and fully interested in events to transpire.<br />

Enjoyment – 9<br />
Overall – 8 {Mastapeece}<br />
Mysterious, atmospheric, and unpredictable.<br />

Junji Ito continues to set a great example for the horror community within, and outside of manga/anime, that keeps viewers on their toes, and in the moment. Shows currently following a similar format (Black Mirror comes to mind) could learn a thing or two from the execution of these stories (In comparison, I’ve enjoyed these 3 episodes more than 4 season of BM).

    I…think you forgot to add a comedy tag, MAL.<br />
<br />
Ito Junji: Collection, despite what the MAL score might lead you to believe is actually decent. Based on the collection of manga of the same name, these stories depict various abnormal occurrences and happenings. From what I know, there isn’t a pattern as to which stories were picked.<br />
<br />
Ito Junji surprised me in many ways, one of those being the creepy atmosphere. Many of the stories are quite unnerving at times, especially with how crude the artstyle is. The fact that the overall art looks quite bad, as in the character models aren’t anything special and the backgrounds

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274761">
        are rather cheap-looking only adds to the tone, which is fitting for a show like this.<br />
One good thing I can say about the characters, or rather, character in this case, is that our main protagonist, Souichi, is a nice addition to these stories. His peculiar and bizarre nature makes everything just a little bit creepier, especially with how he behaves around others. Whenever he’s on screen he does something weird or funny, and it wouldn’t be the same without him.<br />
<br />
Even though Ito Junji is a horror anime, it has a surprising amount of outright hilarious moments, like the whole circus story. The way everything played out felt like an unintentional comedy of sorts, although it worked in this case since it was genuinely funny and not just ironically funny like some “so bad it’s good” shows which don’t try to be funny but end up actually being funny.<br />
<br />
All in all, I quite liked Ito Junji: Collection, and I plan on checking out the manga in the future.<br />

    When an anime makes such a drastic turn in quality, enjoyment and fear factor to the point where you&#039;re compelled to write a review about it is proof that you should give it at least a shot. <br />
<br />
As you can guess from the name, The Ito Junji collection is many of his short stories turned into anime. If you&#039;re completely unfamiliar with any of Ito Junjis work, I highly recommend you read &quot;uzumaki&quot;. It&#039;s not very long however gives you a great starting place for understanding Junjis world. <br />
<br />
When placed into anime form, it honestly looks like his imagery and art have come to life,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review269779">
        the sound direction blends so well and overall it&#039;s a perfect mix.<br />
<br />
As for episodes there is currently only three. I&#039;ll be honest, the first episode was one massive let down for me personally. I was expecting a gruesome horror filled experience but alas it felt more like I was watching a comedy or parody. Regardless, the animation style, voice acting and soundtrack convinced me to give it another go and I was absolutely amazed at both episode 2 and episode 3. Both episodes did his work justice, creating incredibly creepy scenarios as well as even supply some deep philosophical ideas (especially in episode 2)<br />
<br />
It has boosted my love for this show, you&#039;re getting two short horror stories in one episode which will, at the very least, unnerve you to a certain degree. Even if you&#039;re one stone cold B*stard, there&#039;s still tons of enjoyment from watching this and hopefully provides you with inspiration to read Ito Junjis other work<br />
<br />
9/10, I can&#039;t wait for episode 5

    I was excited to see Junji Ito&#039;s work come to life, but after a few episodes I just couldn&#039;t take it anymore.<br />
<br />
The animation is SO FAR BELOW standard, it&#039;s literally atrocious. I stopped in the middle of the 8th episode. You can take a look at other people&#039;s positive reviews, and see when theirs was posted. <br />
<br />
Between missing frames and still images with the mouth barely animated, Studio DEEN managed to outdo Berserk 2016 and grace us with the most terrible anime I&#039;ve seen in years.<br />
<br />
Not only is the animation subpar, they also managed to pick some of Junji Ito&#039;s not so good stories (to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review272401">
        not say duds) which bring no fear at all. Rather some lame attempt at humour.<br />
<br />
The pacing, the color tone, the writing, everything went from OK to terrible in just a few episodes. Please, stay away from this one.<br />
<br />
It does Ito Junji&#039;s work no good.

    LA always has been fine with the supernatural &quot;cosmic horror&quot; at times like ghosts and curses, however LA has a morbid fear of zombies because they are human yet not, LA KNOWS they can&#039;t exist but there is that future logical extreme where humanity kills itself off...with humanity itself and this is where there is a lingering sense of horror from both the mundanity taken to the logical extremes and the unknown...Junji Ito KNOWS this and absolutely runs with it.<br />
<br />
Junji Ito: Collection right off the bat for LA is by the title itself a collection of Junji Ito&#039;s horror works in 22 minute episodes and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274729">
        because of this format LA really can&#039;t talk about the plot as there are multiple plots that really doesn&#039;t connect (one does but semantics), so the best way to talk about Junji Ito is by his signature horror genre he&#039;s famous for...but tied to lackluster animation and the problem itself of making an adaptation of majority of his works into a 12 episode anime.<br />
<br />
Like LA said above, Junji Ito dives into the horror aspect of the mundanity of the normal or the unknown fates of many of his protagonists fate up to chance if they even survive from the &quot;monsters&quot; or the &quot;horror phenomenon&quot;. <br />
<br />
The mundanity of everyday normal things causing the horror strikes a chord with LA like LA&#039;s analogy with zombies but take that and make it even to the simplest things like...blood, oil, beauty, curiosity, unrequited love, dreams and even the moderation of privacy. Jump scares and gore are instant scares that are one timer moments that easily get boring or predictable but the mundanity of the normal brings in the our usual day lives and makes the horror stick from something we do in our repetitive usual day lives and by far Junji Ito knows how the mundanity works to the horror&#039;s advantage. Yeah through LA even saying this, Glyceride has shown LA to never see something as simple as GREASE as disgustingly vomit inducing or how Tomie&#039;s beauty goes into intense obsession.<br />
<br />
On the other side, the unknown is really a simple as many of the protagonists fate are left up in the air, be it if the horror of the story is killed or not, their fates are left in the air and because of this unknown the majority of the time, they get consumed by the horror or it&#039;s the worst result at times. The unknown is scary as we DON&#039;T KNOW IT ITSELF, thus facing the fear of the unknown can be scary as hell as there will be no way of knowing the end result and Junji Ito eats the carrot he&#039;s been dangling at you for the last 10 minutes or so giving us a cosmic horror of the unknown.<br />
<br />
So about the lackluster animation, well the animation done by Studio DEEN for LA was ok enough but the animation tries to get Junji Ito&#039;s horror down into a verbatim animation with somewhat intentionally dull, dreary atmosphere with some interesting sketchbook-like character designs and backgrounding. The cosmic horror is pretty good but LA attributes that to Junji Ito&#039;s vision just now taken into animation format. LA &quot;gets&quot; Studio DEEN&#039;s animation though LA just felt some of the animation became lackluster as Studio DEEN just went verbatim of Junji Ito&#039;s collection of stories without much change when the atmosphere and more detailed animation was needed to inflict the horror of the animation more strikely, though at times LA kinda was ok with that as the horror seen in 1080p in greater detail isn&#039;t something LA DO NOT WANNA SEE...if you know where LA is getting at, as much as LA has gripes with the lackluster animation and though it definitely felt like it, the animation was &quot;ok&quot;, but that&#039;s not much as praise.<br />
<br />
Well the biggest problem LA sees with Junji Ito: Collection is of how the anime adapted his works to animation and by this is that because of ALOT of his works crammed into 12 episode 22 minutes has the implication of being short, there are some benefits like LA said about the unknown fates of many of the protagonists giving us no ending in the process and the effectiveness of it but LA will just say the pacing of many of the episodes are either too quick or too slow and it&#039;s fluctuates depending on the story working with you or not and LA felt it many times while watching Junji Ito: Collection, giving a very confused &quot;THAT&#039;S IT?&quot; or &quot;well that happened&quot;. LA won&#039;t say that the pacing is a huge problem as LA will defend it depending on the episode but it still detriments the horror at times as &quot;meh&quot; and the prime suspect of the pacing problems for LA at least is the weirdest choice of adapting some of his work is of Souichi and his stories as that is primarily seen as a COMEDY with some supernatural horror but it&#039;s nothing but a prankster who has actual voodoo powers and him failing time and again...like what?, the obvious implication for this is the anime has brought in even LESS screentime for his more intense horror stories for a straight up slapstick comedy. Though the only defense LA gets here is the fact of Souichi giving us a breather to more of Junji Ito&#039;s more intense horror stories but LA just found Souichi&#039;s inclusion and his placement of stories in terms of episodes baffling.<br />
<br />
LA&#039;s taste in horror might be weird to some people let alone LA&#039;s fear and as much as LA harped on the faults and benefits of adapting Junji Ito&#039;s work, you know what, LA got Junji Ito&#039;s brand of cosmic mundane horror with many of his stories sticking for the better or worse and even though there is lackluster animation and let alone Studio DEEN even trying to adapt a plethora of Junji Ito&#039;s work and squishing it in a 12 episode format has some huge detriments to it but oddly enough Junji Ito: Collection has been a mundane yet horrifying, crazy as hell, cosmic horror fest. Junji Ito: Collection anime adaptation just might be LA&#039;s weirdest case of &quot;disappointing yet satisfying&quot; in terms of horror.

    if I could give this anime lower than the score of 1, I would.<br />
it&#039;s honestly the worst anime I&#039;ve ever watched, a huge waste of time and an abomination for the manga<br />
<br />
it was just awkward to watch<br />
please do yourself a favour and DONT watch this anime.<br />
<br />
Story - the story (in the manga) is decent, but the story telling in this anime is atrocious <br />
Art - one of the worst and most generic and boring art styles I&#039;ve seen.<br />
Sound - nothing much to say about it, though the voice acting and screams were awfully awkward to listen to <br />
Characters - none memorable characters, the only somewhat

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281440">
        decently animated arc was &quot;Nagai Yume&quot; <br />
Enjoyment - it was a nice joke, but thats all there is to it<br />
Overall - dont bother, staring at the wall sounds like a better experience.

    So...what the verdict for the justification of the King of horror Itou Junji: Collection? Nothing...nothing at all.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;ve thought that a mere 12 episodes can cover the VAST majority of works of Itou Junji throughout the years, don&#039;t expect too much: it&#039;s up to the studio helming the project (that is Studio low-budget Deen) to pick the stories and feedback from the creator himself to see which stories are worth watching onto the main screen.<br />
<br />
The first nitpick that (not only) I (but others too) see is that the stories are picked at random, and the reason for that is actually the idea of Itou Junji

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274672">
        himself to give us jump-scare surprises when we watch the episodic story episodes every week. Props for the well intent of the creator, but that may also be the reason why it backfired because of our certain requirements as to which story SHOULD be animated. If that was the case, with everyone having their own requested story, it&#039;s not gonna be enough to fill in the 12 episode void, so good job on cleaning the shit there.<br />
<br />
Again, for people like myself who typically don&#039;t like the horror genre (movies included), this is definitely NOT a great representation of justice to the man who&#039;s works expand years that frighten people off (of reading the manga source) with the sense of foreboding. Granted, there are numerous problems with the anime adaptation but I&#039;ll give my 2 cents and let you decide whether if this is worth your time.<br />
<br />
The art...isn&#039;t horrible by any means, AS IN the ways of illustrating the story of choice, the manga was terrifying enough to make you pee your pants, but the anime adaptation (for some reason) had to be dumbed down (in case of violence and gore). The move is understandable, but the creative content by itself STILL shouldn&#039;t sell off what started off as gore and when translated, almost the entire substance feels off. Moreover, the hand-drawn art indeed gave me chills, but mildly. Overall, it&#039;s Studio Deen, what do you expect???<br />
<br />
The sound could use some refining too, especially the VAs working on the different characters each week, they get the job done...but mildly as well. I will give an honorable mention to the OST, especially the rock-based OP that&#039;s supposed to reel you in the horror, and the calm but sometimes nauseous ED that if honestly there&#039;s something good about this show, it&#039;s the music that sells.<br />
<br />
Overall, Itou Junji: Collection is not a bad show per se, but the redeeming qualities are outweighed by the factors that hint this as a sub-par, mediocre show. Combined with low ratings, and what you have is a recipe of nothingness that only excels in letting people be more disappointed than the horror it should have promised from the start.

    So far (Episode 6 ) I&#039;m pretty disappointed with &quot;Ito Junji Collection&quot; for two reasons:<br />
<br />
Firstly, the pacing is not very good, I think it has a lot to do with their decision to force two stories into every 22mins episode, therefor a lot of minor points got cut out, which hurt the atmosphere building drastically.<br />
<br />
Then the art varies form passable to just bad, I don&#039;t know how much budged they had making this show but it doesn&#039;t seem to be much. And the overall color palette is too bright, not moody enough. <br />
<br />
Needless to say this doesn&#039;t do justice to Ito&#039;s work. <br />

    I was really looking forward to this anime... and I was quite disappointed after watching 7 episodes. <br />
<br />
Story: 2/10<br />
Each short horror story in this anime never fulfills my expectations. This is mainly because every ending to a story is anticlimatic and makes no sense; it&#039;s not satisfactory. Most stories are not understandable and each story gets more and more ridiculous. However, the best story i&#039;ve seen in this anime was Long Dreams; it had a really interesting plot and idea, therefore I really enjoyed it... until I watched the story &quot;Slug Girl.&quot; Not only did this story have a ridiculous plot, but also had a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review271919">
        ridiculous ending. Not to mention that this story was only 4 minutes long.<br />
<br />
Art: 5/10<br />
It&#039;s alright<br />
<br />
Character: 3/10<br />
I&#039;m not sure if anyone agrees with me but don&#039;t all the male protagonists in each story look the same? Like, they&#039;re totally different people but they look like literal dopplegangers. They should at least show some variation in the characters.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4/10<br />
I guess although some stories were ridiculous, they were still quite entertaining. But most stories had terrible endings.

    What is man&#039;s favorite word? Starts with an M and end with Arriage. A miscarriage. Ayyyyyy, This joke never gets old, and neither does the baby.<br />
<br />
This joke is quite accurate way of introducing just about anyone to Itou Junji&#039;s anime. It offers similarly tasteless jokes about rather abstract events that are presented as a horror comedy. It&#039;s a collection of tales that  varie from snail using a human head as a shell to a person drinking so much grease he turns into grease himself. Lovely. This was my favorite story for sure. His palms were sweatier than Eminem ever thought was possible. <br />
<br />
Approaching this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review278300">
        series with open mind and owning a sick sense of humor will definitely help oneself to enjoy this DEEN&#039;s newest animated masterpiece. The series comes with a lot of quality differences and won&#039;t appeal to most of its viewers. Pretty much no one thinks anything special about it. This because it really isn&#039;t anything special. It&#039;s different for sure and worth of giving a try for that reason no doubt. <br />
<br />
The characters are pretty memorable. Especially the guy who eats nails. I don&#039;t mean his own nails, but literally iron nails. He was pretty cool. Would definitely befriend if I met a guy like that. Other characters aren&#039;t really worth of noting, but DEEN did pretty good job when designing them for this anime. The voice acting is what you would expect. No nyaaas or ara ara&#039;s are given. These people are weird, but sound realistic. <br />
<br />
I recommend watching this series solely for the scene where giant woman comes out of the swamp and be like &quot;ain&#039;t no Shrek gonna take over what is mine.&quot; I died of laughter, then came back alive just to finish this show.  <br />

    Yeah, it&#039;s bad. <br />
<br />
To talk about why Ito Junji Collection is a terrible mess is to talk about what makes a horrible anime adaptation. I&#039;d like to first establish what was expected of it, and explain why it failed (even if most of it is obvious at first glance).<br />
<br />
The bottom line for a decent anime adaptation is to provide an alternative way to experience the original work. More often than not that means a panel to panel adaptation with worse pacing and art, but now in color, fully voiced, scored and animated. Might sound fine on paper but it usually doesn&#039;t make the manga obsolete

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275617">
        as anime rarely manage to adapt entirety of the story, and for many people the lack of detailed and stylish art can be a massive downside.<br />
<br />
At best it can become something like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. An anime that takes the original work, captures what people loved about it, and then goes an extra mile to use every strength anime medium has to offer to enhance it. Making the world come to live with vibrant colors, and turning action scenes into real spectacles by utilizing many talented animators. All while fatefully telling you the original story.<br />
<br />
The possibility like that is what made the prospect of good Junji Ito anime so appealing. And then everyone saw that DEEN is behind it, snuffing any spark of hope that existed before. Then it actually came out and somehow managed to be even worse than I expected.<br />
<br />
Junji Ito Collection doesn&#039;t just fail to meet the bottom line, It starts below it and then actively digs itself further down, as if looking for remains of Berserk&#039;s 2016 adaptation.<br />
To start with, the directing is nearly non-existent. Shinobu Tagashira mindlessly follows manga chapters panel by panel without adding anything to them. More often than not he&#039;s actively making it worse since he doesn&#039;t translate the dramatic framing and progression of said panels, leaving you with a picture that always feels lifeless, flat, boring. Junji Ito is a master at capturing the reader&#039;s attention with his acute understanding of manga. He puts in a lot of effort to build the tension and increasing it all the way to the climax when the horror starts to spiral out of control. All of this is lost.<br />
<br />
In part this is due to inadequacy of art in IJC. It would be one thing if they just failed to capture the complexity of Ito&#039;s haunting art, brimming with attention to detail that pushed it from creepy to genuinely unsettling. No, they once again dip below the lowest standard. While I&#039;ll commend Shinobu Tagashira for managing to adapt the manga designs for animation, none of it matters when they&#039;re badly drawn with depressing consistency. From derpy eyes that float all over the face, to stiff poses, to things that barely look human. Already souless anime becomes even harder to get invested in when it looks like that.<br />
<br />
Animation blends perfectly with the rest of the adaptation in its ability to undermine the source material. There are multiple times throughout the show where IJC just gives up on even trying and shows you a still cutout moving around on the screen without anything to try and hide it. If it was any worse it would be a camcorder footage of someone waving a stick with a drawing glued on top. It&#039;s not always that terrible but it never adds anything of value. When Kagewani and Yami Shibai exist and manage to tell imaginative horror stories with minimal animation there&#039;s no excuse. It doesn&#039;t make for a great adaptation but it would still be an improvement compared to this.<br />
<br />
Ito Junji Collection is not thoroughly bad, but most of the positive things I have to say about it are elements of original work left unbutchered in the process of adaptation, oversight on DEEN&#039;s part no doubt. While the impact is ruined the stories are still recognisably that of Junji Ito and his wild imagination. The selection is not weak either, it adapts some of the more memorable stories, some of which are consistently brought up when talking about Junji Ito&#039;s writing talent and/or art. Other than that the voice acting is pretty standard and the only real standout are the excellent OP and ED that capture the tone and bizarre nature of Ito and sound amazing. <br />
<br />
In the end, Junji Ito Collection is just a bastardization of original work. It keeps the stories intact but it removes all the things that made them work. Please, don&#039;t watch it.

    JUNJI ITOU COLLECTION (24/3/18)<br />
<br />
This anime is to Junji Itou’s work is what Shyamalan’s The Last Airbender was to Nickelodeon’s Avatar series. It’s an adaptation so crude in its execution that the original’s fandom will deny it ever happened.<br />
<br />
ART (0/10)<br />
<br />
The Junji Itou Collection has what is easily the worst “animation” I have seen in anime, that is to say there is barely any. Most of the shots are static and the illusion of movement is created by camera pans or sudden shaking. What little animation feels obligatory, like adding a couple extra frames to make a character’s mouth look like it’s moving, and often looks convulsive

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274899">
        and unnatural. Characters will either shake violently to make it feel ~scary~ or if the animators are feeling especially lazy then some characters may slide across the floor instead of walking.<br />
<br />
The art style is vaguely like Junji Itou’s, but it’s so watered-down that it’s offensive. While Itou’s manga is characterised by the intricate details that make the experience truly captivating and beautifully grotesque, this anime aimed for the bare minimum and missed it by a few miles. The otherworldly creatures that Itou is famous for come to life as something out of a children’s bad horror book and... what looks like CGI? I don’t know, not even CGI in anime has looked so unintentionally comical. The only time when the anime looks good is when it directly copy &amp; pastes a panel from the manga and adds colour to it, but even when it redraws scenes it makes them absolutely devoid of the atmosphere and horror that the original is so rich with.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS (2/12)<br />
<br />
As the stories are short one-shots that usually span 10 minutes there is obviously not much time to flesh out any characters. However the anime never makes even an effort to go beyond what the source material gives it. Although the characters in Itou’s work are only secondary to the horrors that each story recounts, each character still has some sort of motive. Sometimes it’s to become independent, other times to satiate their curiosity, but most times to survive.<br />
<br />
But again, the Junji Itou Collection fails on this front where the characters don’t seem to be passionate about anything and most of their decisions seem to come out of nowhere. This is because the anime decides to leave out some parts that may be unimportant to the main storyline but give us insight into the characters’ heads, leaving the audience with an abridged version of the original, and not even a good one.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can give this aspect of the show is that it doesn’t add unnecessary characters to the show, which is something that always bothers me. But it’s not like they had the initiative to.<br />
<br />
SOUND (2/6)<br />
<br />
The theme songs are good to listen to and suit Itou’s style. The opening gets you excited and the ending lulls you to an almost suspicious rest. Unfortunately none of your anticipation is met.<br />
<br />
The OST is basically nonexistent and I cannot remember a single piece that I heard watching this show. Even some stories that require a good sound design to make any sense at all were neglected in this part, such as an episode where characters lose their mind over an unbelievably good music CD, but, AGAIN, the show fails to make an effort where it counts to make the CD sound at least good. The voice-acting is subpar and when combined with the badly drawn facial expressions it makes a lot of the characters’ reactions unrealistic and therefore impossible to relate to.<br />
<br />
STORY (0/12)<br />
<br />
Another defining feature of Itou’s manga is its bizarre premises and how, with careful pacing trepid developments, what may be an unrealistic reaction becomes understandable. However this adaptation rushes the stories and completely misses their point and what makes them effective.<br />
<br />
The biggest offender is the much-anticipated story Painter, featuring Itou’s most famous character Tomie. The story requires previous knowledge of the main character, which isn’t a problem in the manga because the chapter is published after the chapters that introduce us to Tomie. Seems obvious that you need the start to get to a side story, right? Not to this anime’s staff. <br />
<br />
Another issue is that in the manga chapter the titular painter loses his sanity over Tomie slowly and steadily, whereas in the anime because the staff felt obliged to cram in two stories for every episode without exception, the painter’s descent to madness feels more like a leap.<br />
<br />
OVERALL<br />
<br />
The anime takes Itou’s ideas and throws them with as much power over a rock-hard road, then runs them over with a lorry and pours paint over them. It’s the very definition of doing the bare minimum. Don’t watch unless you want to pretend Itou isn’t a great author.<br />
<br />
Final score: 1/10

    (this is my very first review)<br />
In the words of the YouTuber Super Eyepatch Wolf, The Junji Ito Collection is disappointing garbage. <br />
I&#039;ve recently become a fan of Ito&#039;s work, and I was excited for this anime. But...I have been very disappointed. The anime is lazy, lifeless and has no real impact, full of washed out colors, bad cuts and technical errors. <br />
The Collection is boring, and so painfully mediocre - but the work it is based on is not. It doesn&#039;t fully harness the terror and detail that Ito puts into his work, his heart and soul and every painstaking detail that is put into

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274371">
        the panels. I feel like this.. &quot;adaptation&quot; is an insult to his work, ignoring the symbolism and depth in his works and turning them into flat scenes with horrible animation and terrible story boarding. <br />
The Collection also doesn&#039;t harness the use of Ito&#039;s horror, tension and anticipation, either. It falls flat on the scares and gore and Ito&#039;s use of the page turn, something unique to manga and books, as a way to show horror that could have been so amazingly adapted into something that could only be used in animation. The horror genre has so much potential in animation and unfortunately, this work has failed to harness it.

    Awful adaptation of a bunch of Junji Ito&#039;s stories. Most of them have been  cut short and have no conclusion whatsoever. The artwork is incredibly poor compared to Ito&#039;s originals (sans a few), which heavily minimizes the shock factor. Most of the stories involving monsters are awful because if this. Needless to say, the best of the bunch are the ones which center around a concept rather than on shocking imagery (mostly due to Ito&#039;s storywriting).<br />
<br />
Overall, I wouldn&#039;t recommend this. Only to Ito fans, but only because there are no other animated adaptations of his works (Gyo was even worse than this).<br />
<br />
<br />
Notable stories (both

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293371">
        good and bad):<br />
<br />
- Fashion Model: Destroyed because of the mediocre animation.<br />
- The Long Dream: The definite best of the stories. The concept is great and the execution was handled decently.<br />
- Boy at the Crossroads: Left incomplete. Only 1/4 of the whole story was adapted.<br />
- Slug Girl: Heavily butchered and badly adapted. The absolute worst of the series.<br />
- Cloth Teacher: The best of the Souichi stories. Has a great sense of black humor and it&#039;s very enjoyable to watch.<br />
- Painter: One of the most interesting of the Tomie stories. It&#039;s also the only story in this series involving shock factor that actually looked decent.<br />
- Greased: Great atmosphere, but was left inconclusive.

    I&#039;m disappointed. Then again, it&#039;s extremely hard to translate the intricate art of Junji Ito into anime, especially when a lot of the horror is left up to the readers and the timing of scares is originally left up to them, too. It makes me sad, this could&#039;ve been a lot better. However, if Ito himself said he was satisfied with the end product, I guess I kind of am, too. I just feel that a lot of the weight some of the art and scenes had were taken away in this adaptation. It&#039;s not good, but it&#039;s not really terrible or unwatchable, and someone

          <span style="display: none;" id="review423174">
        who isn&#039;t really all about Ito and his works can still enjoy this and get scared if it&#039;s their first viewing.<br />

    Horor anime for most people have almost always been labled as not very good on genuinely lacking the atmosphere or scare tactics of most other media the genre provides. There&#039;s something about a creature being animated, or a body getting ripped apart that just doesnt have the same affect as the real thing. Most horror anime almost always have to resort to be labled as: &quot;action suspence&quot; to get any fans attention. Shows like Helsing, Tokyo Goul, Parasyte, ect all rely on action and ultra gore to get any viewers. Then comes the work of manga artist Junji Ito. The man responsible for so many

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274915">
        creepy pop up images that make people just go &quot;The 7#(% am I looking at?&quot; His art has a purpose to make anyone who views it genuinely uncomfortable, whether through gore, gross out, or basic confusing endings. So with such a huge cult following it was only a matter of time that they give it an anime adaptation. But is it any good?<br />
<br />
Lets see what the series does right, first and most important is they follow Ito&#039;s stories exactly as he presents them. No cutting anything too graphic, no adding pointless scenes, its all as he intended it. Unlike another adaptation of his work Gyo: Tokyo Fish Attack this refrains from making any changes from his story so he&#039;s only person that could be blamed for poor writing is Ito himself. <br />
<br />
But you can blame the show for adapting some of Ito&#039;s more boring/poorly written stories. Some of the stories especially in later episodes can be extremly confusing if not entirly anticlimactic. Stories like a circus that murders its performers to feed the ringleader. Or an elderly woman is being haunted because her town doesnt know how to properly hold a funeral. Some can be extremly boring if not leaving you wanting there to be more explination to the story.<br />
<br />
Another thing the show does well is its building of atmosphere. The shows segments are always shown at night or in cloudy whether building atmoshphere mixed with the shows slow and creepy soundtrack setting up the mood briliantly. Its tone is also very quiet and sneaky ofen taking you by surprise when the scary stuff goes down. No build up in the music, no panning for a jumpscare. Just WHAM scary! <br />
<br />
Now when it gets down to it the show I feel the best way to watch it is at night, or when its cloudy. Preferably with friends because your more likely to react if others do. And there are some episodes that I feel are much better then others and are a must:<br />
<br />
1. Anything with Souichi: 1A 5B 12B His charecter is creepy enough and the stories show Ito&#039;s world perfectly<br />
2. Fashion Model: 2A The most intense, and the payoff is really effective. <br />
3. Window next Door, Gentle Goodbye: 6 Both stories show how diverse Ito&#039;s stories are. One being on campground urban legend level of creepy, and the secpnd being the most emotional episode and a facinating twist on a ghost story.<br />
4. Painter: 9A Sets up the upcomming Tomie OVA and has the most disturbing final image.<br />
<br />
Some of the weaker episodes are:<br />
1. The Circus comes to Town: 8B Ends on a clifhanger but didnt really deserve it.<br />
2. Greased and Bridge: 10 The first part is disgusting as in a girl gets pimple juice poured all over her face nasty(and that&#039;s not even the scary part), and the second part is built up for no payoff whatsoever.<br />
<br />
So is this the perfect horror show we&#039;ve been waiting for....not really, but it&#039;s creative, has good atmosphere, and if you like genuine creepy horror give it a watch!<br />

    //This is the first review I have written on this App. Just for trivial sakes.<br />
<br />
There is no doubt that Junji Ito&#039;s is one of the best horror writers in Japanese Media. He can captivate an eerie feeling in all of his stories, even if the horror itself isn&#039;t obvious. A lot of this is tribute to the way he draws, it all just has a darker feel to it, not comparable to today&#039;s recognisable &#039;horror&#039; Manga. So an anime adaptation is really tricky to pull off. I reckon, if it was given under the right hands, this would be very successful and possibly inspire animation

          <span style="display: none;" id="review273583">
        studios to not be afraid of animating this genre. But sadly this adaptation is a massive let down, I&#039;ve just finished watching episode 10 and I&#039;m at the point where I&#039;m lucky to be watching this as it comes out weekly... Other wise I probably would have dropped it by the third episode. Anyway this is all my opinion, if you enjoy the anime this isn&#039;t an attack on you but the anime itself, heck I love Junji Ito&#039;s work. Anyway lets get into the nitty gritty of this shall we?...<br />
<br />
<br />
Story 6/10:<br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t a big surprise but most of Junji Ito&#039;s One-Offs rarely focuses on story but more on the actual horror that is being represented in his works. Lets use &#039;Fashion Model&#039; as an example. The main character barely gets developed and all we pretty much know about him is that he &quot;Knows when something isn&#039;t right&quot;. Its more focused on how the main character acts towards the main force of threat, being the &#039;Fashion Model&#039;. This is evident in a lot of his stories. The only characters in this adaptation I can say gets some sort of character development is the Shuichi and Tomie stories. Even then its still not great. One thing I can say which is a good positive is that it keeps loyal to its source material... Most of the time. The longer stories like &#039;Lovesick Dead&#039; and &#039;The Street With No Roads&#039; Just get butchered. I mean, it does leave people who have read these stories with a disappointing take on it. They could have dedicated a few episodes to bigger stories instead of following the rule of two stories an episode.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art 5/10:<br />
<br />
-sigh- This is something I really don&#039;t want to write about as this is one of the adaptation&#039;s worst points. The art is poor, especially with far away shots. One of the &#039;Fashion Model&#039; Far shots had me in tears. Not in tears of fear. But in laughter. Some of the close up shots are alright but definitely not up to the Manga&#039;s standards. Even then putting the Manga out of the equation, the art seems just like a generic anime. The art is at its best when someone reacts to the horror close up. There is a sense of dread at times that do change the experience from being just plain dull. But there isn&#039;t nearly enough of those &#039;good, close up shots&#039; to be passable. So the art is very mediocre. Oh and just as a side note. I hate it when anime uses real f****** pictures. The &#039;Honoured Ancestors&#039; had one particular scene where they used a REAL LIFE image and just pretty much zoomed in on it. Like really? If you have watched the anime up till now you probably know what I&#039;m talking about. Case in point, not as terrifying as the Manga for sure.<br />
<br />
<br />
Animation 6/10:<br />
<br />
Not much I can say here other then the fact that its just okay. Not great. But not bad. I think the only time where I dislike the way they animated things was in the &#039;Marionette Mansion&#039; episode. I felt like they could have made much more of the movements fluent... They pretty much float around the room as if they were in space. They don&#039;t even feel like real puppets and thats what they are supposed to be! Other than this story; animation is good.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound 6/10:<br />
<br />
It feels like its pretty much a gamble with sound really, sometimes its used effectively and other times its not really used as well as it should. The opening is fantastic if that counts as sound. When sound is used effectively (Fashion Model probably had the best sounds that fit the atmosphere of the episode) it can change the mood and make things feel more scary. Overall. Again, it has its highlights but most of the time its just okay. Thats pretty much the trend of this review. The voice actors are again not bad, but some just aren&#039;t trying at all. Especially some of the monsters. I feel like Fuchi had the best voice actor, as despite her horrifying appearance, she is calm and opening which definitely makes things more creepy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 6/10:<br />
<br />
So my feelings towards this adaptation is pretty much just full of false hope, that they would be able to adapt a story perfectly. There are were few that have been good, like &#039;Fashion Model&#039; &#039;Painter&#039; etc. But a lot of the time stories just don&#039;t meet expectations. Stories that are supposed to be creepy and make you think, are let down by mediocre art and half-assed animation. &#039;Long Dreams&#039; could have been far scarier if the effort and detail is put into it, but we are left with just mediocrity, like most of the anime. I recently just finished &#039;Greased&#039; which, arguably enough, was the reason I wrote this in the first place. The original made me feel ill on how well detailed and creepy it was, you&#039;d think the anime would make it even grosser but no. It didn&#039;t. It was pretty tame actually. So I will probably watch the final two episodes. And never comeback to it. Such a shame...<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall 6/10:<br />
<br />
This is probably the most disappointing anime of this year as of writing this... Junji Ito is a legend among all horror writers and going back reading his works reminds me of the sense of fear I felt the first time I read those stories. Heck, &#039;Fashion Model&#039; made me have trouble sleeping. So I was excited for this adaptation, but I knew from the first episode that I was gonna be left disappointed, from the half-assed animation, to not being able to properly capture the sense of fear that Junji Ito is known for. It&#039;s just passable as a mediocre anime. Trust me, writing this has been quite sad actually. I was really hoping this would be amazing and change a lot of &#039;horror&#039; that has come out over the years. Maybe in a couple years time we will get a second season in which a different studio will have an attempt at animating it. But for now. This anime adaptation of the horror legend himself... gets a score of 6/10. Its not terrible, but just disappointing.<br />

    No spoilers but an IMPORTANT PIECE OF ADVICE! If you suffer from trypophobia either skip the FIRST HALF of the 4th episode (after the 10 minute mark), or just skip the 4th episode entirely if you don&#039;t want to try and find where the second story begins and possibly see some of the first story. The second half doesn&#039;t have any trypophobia in it but the first short story is entirely set around it!!! I know it&#039;s a horror show but if you have this phobia (like me) I&#039;d hate for anyone to possibly go into panic mode ((like I did)). Please use caution! I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review270687">
        love this show because I am a huge fan of horror and I&#039;ve read some of Junji Ito&#039;s works and immediately fell in love. After seeing the (imo) mess that was Gyo and the Uzumaki movie I&#039;m glad his works are being made into anime even though I know most of his concepts and complex art don&#039;t translate well into animation.
