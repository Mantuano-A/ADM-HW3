    To start my review, let me say that I don&#039;t necessarily hate Arcana Famiglia.<br />
<br />
I simply hate the payoff I got for watching it. Which was absolutely nothing.<br />
<br />
The entire series looks as if it is building for this tournament that has been set to decide who will be the new leader of the Family and marries the boss&#039; daughter.<br />
<br />
In the first episode, you get some immediate development in the relationship between father and daughter plus daughter and coworkers. To add, there are some pretty nice powers being used and an awesome mysterious character with an awesome name looming in the background (Jolly). So, when the series

          <span style="display: none;" id="review88099">
        starts, you know where some people stand and how things are going to go.<br />
<br />
The only thing is, it never goes there.<br />
<br />
Arcana Famiglia gives you the build for this tournament that&#039;s soon to take place. Every episode is wasted on character development and character interaction. You see everyone&#039;s past and you even find the origin of the family. For a build-up, this is great, it helps strengthen character connection so that you root for a particular character to win when the fighting starts.<br />
<br />
The fighting doesn&#039;t start. Ever.<br />
<br />
Watching the entire series would be worth it if it led to some awesome battle royal conclusion. It would even be awesome if a bunch of pirates just came and ruined said battle royal. Neither happens. All of the action is skipped and the powers aren&#039;t expanded on any further than episode one. They&#039;re explained, but they aren&#039;t expanded on.<br />
<br />
Another thing, this has to be the only series I&#039;ve seen where I think character development was a bad thing. The characters lose any finesse that they had when their lives are explored. The only exception was Jolly, who barely got any screentime in most of this series. And he didn&#039;t even participate in any real fighting. However, I can tell you exactly what his past is like and why he&#039;s so cold. That&#039;s absurd and just plain ridiculous.<br />
<br />
The anime takes so much time in explaining every single character and having them fight their demons that we don&#039;t even see what their demons really are. They never come across any serious conflict and the only climax to look forward to is the tournament that&#039;s supposed to be the motherload of all battles.<br />
<br />
The battling is non-existent. Chances are I said that earlier in the review, but I must emphasize how bad it was. For one, it was minimum. There was no intricate fighting nor any type of personalized moves. The tournament that the series builds up to becomes absolutely pointless with every new episode. The winner was even pointless and so was their &quot;resolve&quot; once they won. You really feel like a major butt for even watching the entire series for a climax that could&#039;ve been the length of an average youtube video.<br />
<br />
And to make matters worst, it doesn&#039;t try to cover its flaws. Maybe a little fanservice or some nice cop-out scenes. Nope, not once. It burrows a reverse harem shtick that it can&#039;t even fully deliver on. You don&#039;t feel like these guys (with the exception of two) are all that into her.<br />
<br />
There were no antagonists. There was minimum fighting. The romance barely showed and was ended on the weakest of terms. The characters don&#039;t live up to their reputations. The story blows major chunks.<br />
<br />
The climax . . . faking it.

    I&#039;m a huge fan of shoujo, romance, and reverse harems; my absolute favorite is Ouran High School.<br />
<br />
So I really, REALLY, wanted to enjoy this. <br />
<br />
The art is beautiful, the characters are beautiful and all each unique in their own way.<br />
<br />
The powers are very cool; very unique and original in concept.<br />
<br />
The storyline seemed promising.<br />
<br />
Everything, seemed promising, everything has so much potential.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what&#039;s the problem here?&quot; You may ask.<br />
<br />
The main character, is the problem.<br />
<br />
The story revolves around one girl; named Felicita, she does not speak, does not have a personality, all she really honestly does is stand in the background of every scene and look pretty while

          <span style="display: none;" id="review67797">
        the male characters do all the talking. <br />
<br />
When she does occasionally talk, it&#039;s &quot;eh?&quot; or &quot;What&#039;s wrong _____?&quot; <br />
<br />
She only talks at appropriate times, when needed.<br />
<br />
She just makes sounds, you find her character, very VERY, flat and robotic. <br />
<br />
All of the male characters have more personality than her, SERIOUSLY. <br />
<br />
Even the side male characters that you know won&#039;t get the girl, talk more than her, they all have more personality than her.<br />
<br />
Her reactions to things and situations are either too downplayed, where it&#039;s as if she didn&#039;t or doesn&#039;t react to things at all, doesn&#039;t notice things around her, doesn&#039;t care almost.<br />
<br />
But when the story forces her to care, it&#039;s overblown, and she suddenly cares SO much, it&#039;s unrealistic.<br />
<br />
I wanted to drop the show after the second episode was ALREADY a filler, it was an episode, about a cat, just some random stupid cat, and really would you spend an entire day looking for an owner of a cat. I was hoping that the owner of the cat would be someone important, but in the end it was just some random lady that had nothing to do with anything.<br />
<br />
A useless filler episode.<br />
<br />
There wasn&#039;t any romance in the episode either, it was just honestly, a time waster.<br />
<br />
But I kept watching anyways. <br />
<br />
Episode three seemed like another filler, but it became potentially good at the end when the mystery child returns to Jolly, and a part of Liberta&#039;s past revealed. <br />
<br />
Giving us a thought that this might get darker and more serious, with Jolly&#039;s &quot;shady research&quot; and the strange child returning to him.<br />
<br />
With Liberta&#039;s mysterious power, the episode left me wanting to know.<br />
<br />
Fourth Episode, reveals liberta&#039;s past, but I felt as though it was all rushed and down very shabbily. <br />
<br />
It just seemed half assed, it was good, but shown half assedly. <br />
<br />
It just saddens me because this anime has SO much potential, so many wonderful characters, so many good ideas, but it&#039;s shown very lousily.<br />
<br />
So with potentially good plots and ideas already wasted, and the main character&#039;s flat personality.<br />
<br />
I have sadly decided to drop this Anime.<br />
<br />
Also a note: I understand that this is derived from a game, and since in the game you get to pick how you talk and interact with the characters, you basically choose the girl&#039;s personality, I do not understand why they chose to leave the main character&#039;s personality blank in the anime as well, you can&#039;t just imagine she has a personality, she has to have one if she&#039;s interacting with the other characters on her own, so leaving her quiet and blank most of the time, does not work in an anime. <br />
<br />
They should have given her more personality, interests, quirks, dislikes, they should have just made her more human, and not just a blank pretty doll that&#039;s important because she&#039;s the daughter of a very important man, and very attractive, in my opinion. <br />
<br />
Like if you want to make a huge group of attractive men like her, then you have to sell her to us too, give us reasons as to why she&#039;s so likable, why do all the men want her as their wife? <br />
<br />
So far the only reasons I&#039;ve been able to notice is that she&#039;s attractive and the daughter of everyone&#039;s boss. <br />
<br />
And basically the only available girl in the anime; an attractive bachelorette with looks, money, and power.<br />
<br />
Nothing actually deep like other than shallow attraction. <br />
<br />
Yes Liberta likes her, a lot, but why, why does he like her so much?<br />
<br />
Is it just because she&#039;s the only girl his age in the anime? <br />
<br />
Come on.. <br />
<br />
Instead of wasting episodes and production on filler stuff, why didn&#039;t you use those episodes to develop the main story and to tell us why the main character is so desired?<br />
<br />
Either way.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m done:<br />
<br />
Story - 7/10 <br />
(Story is good and has potential but not presented well.)<br />
Art - 9/10 <br />
(The art is quality.)<br />
Sound - 10/10 <br />
(The voice actors are superb.)<br />
Character - 7/10<br />
(All the male characters are good, but the main character&#039;s mother and father has more personality than she does herself.)<br />
Enjoyment - 5/10<br />
(Almost all the episodes except the first seemed like fillers to me, very boring, with attempts at making it more exciting.)<br />
<br />
Overall - 6/10

    When La Storia Della Arcana Famiglia, or just Arcana Famiglia started airing, I was first surprised over how entertaining I found it, considering it was based on a dating sim visual novel for girls. The quality of the art and animations where good, the story appeared interesting, but most of all was the character gallery and their hidden powers very appealing.<br />
<br />
After watching the whole series I was saddened to see it was only the first episode that showed true potential of what this series might eventually have become had it not been for certain downfalls that I will try to explain bellow.<br />
<br />
The story, which is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review72511">
        supposed to be a love story with Felecità, and one of the male characters in the series never seems to advance.<br />
Most episodes aren&#039;t even slightly connected to either Felecità or romance at all, and the typical rivaling struggle between the two male protagonists grows to be nothing but annoying over the course of the series.<br />
Felecità remains more as a background accessory, whilst non of the male characters seems to be interested in her above the point of cheering her up when she is depressed. Which she happens to be in all the later episodes. This depression is also the only real emotion she expresses, which is kinda sad considering this is supposed to be a love story.<br />
<br />
However, the main factor that brings this series down from what it could have been is the way they neglect to explore any character. <br />
In most of the episodes we are introduced to a new characters personality and background, which could have become very interesting, had it not been for the fact that we only ever get to see the surface of every characters life. Not one single character throughout  the whole series is properly explored. We are only shown enough to know that &quot;There is a lot more to know&quot;. <br />
Not even the main characters are properly explored, which leaves us at loss as of what pasts all these people share.<br />
We are only shown glimpses of their pasts, and it is never properly explained what really happened between any of them.<br />
<br />
All in all, Arcana Famiglia starts out with a great potential, and the very interesting character gallery, which end up being completely wasted due to the lack of progress the characters make, and non of them being properly introduced or explored.<br />
When this series ended I honestly felt a little angry with the producers, having wasted a lot of potential, and made what could have been a super cool action/shoujo/romance into just another series nobody will remember in a year.<br />
<br />
Note that I have not played the game, but I sincerely hope and believe that it is much better than the anime.

    Watching Arcana Familga is like reading an autobiography, you know..the sort of book a person writes about his or own life and it is usually full of all sorts of boring details. In any case, Arcana Famiglia is a strange series from the start. <br />
<br />
La Storia Della Arcana Famiglia details a group of people who have made contracts with the Arcana cards to obtain special abilities in his or her own rights. On the birthday of the head of household, the Father decides to host a tournament -  a series of duels known as the  Arcana Duello, between Arcana-users. It is every one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review69443">
        for themselves because it&#039;s winner takes all. <br />
<br />
Apparently, the series&#039; promo depicts around a tournament but half way now through the series, what do we have?<br />
<br />
- cat/neko chasing<br />
- babysitting <br />
- rivalries between two of the main characters in a boring love triangle that has little flavor<br />
<br />
At any rate, this series is not exactly the smash of the season and shouldn&#039;t be especially with throwing in fillers at the very get go. <br />
<br />
The series continuously avoid the major story of the series but instead throws fillers at your face like apple pies. But the story is not as tasty. It lacks flavor of an apple pie because they are all fillers from the beginning. Although later on, we do see some storyline development (chiefly flashbacks), the main story so far is avoided. Furthermore, it seems that the flashbacks are cliched and stereotyped. Honestly, who on Earth is planning on sitting through over four episodes to watch some flashbacks? We want to see some movement and drama with the main arc! <br />
<br />
Luckily though, the character designs are cool. And of course, they need to be especially since everything up to this point has been focused on the characters of the tournament (you know, the one that hasn&#039;t yet officially begun yet). But towards the finale (yes the very last episode), the duel is finally presented. Even the duel itself has some problems though with one of the main characters actually withdrawing while other battles between our cute pigtailed girl being way too short and no flavor.<br />
<br />
Felicità is the main heroine of the series, the  holder of The Lovers arcana, which gives her the ability to read the hearts of others. She is spicy, she is cute, and she is to herself. And those little pigtails, who doesn&#039;t want to cuddle them? Beyond that though, she has some interesting interactions between two of the main characters, Libertà and Nova.<br />
<br />
That brings to their rivalry.<br />
<br />
It seems that Libertà and Nova often gets into fights like ying and yang. Just look at it. Every five minutes in the series, they fight out and competes sometimes over absolutely nothing. Libertà is depicted as the hot headed guy while Nova remains his cool. (most of the time) Regardless though, it gets old after watching it over 9000 times. Besides, there&#039;s already rivalries similar to this without the l for love in a certain ongoing series. Perhaps the Tail of the Fairies ring a bell? <br />
<br />
The other characters of the series seem to be like background characters of a stage play so far despite their cool appearances. The bold headed guy who has the ace hands of a bazooka, the cool level headed guy with the eye patch, and the mysterious Jolly with his shades. I&#039;m sure they will eventually get the opportunity to shine but so far, it&#039;s not happening. Besides maybe Jolly, everything seems so stale between the background characters. Yup, the apple pie is once again losing its flavor.<br />
<br />
Luckily, there is some minor good flavors for this disappointing anime so far. The soundtrack, namely the opening  song of the series seems to play well in this series. <br />
<br />
Magenta Another Sky&quot; by Hitomi Harada is well orchestrated and depicts the Arcana-users showing off some of their abilities in the sequences. The music is also catchy and as one of the first series to watch on Sundays, it&#039;s a pretty damn good way to start off the week, at least in the music department.<br />
<br />
The art is also colorful in this series. It gives off an Italian like atmosphere and overall, demonstrated well with the cool looking characters, some backgrounds, and the mansion where the family stays at. <br />
<br />
Overall, to enjoy this series, you&#039;d have to be a real brave fighter, one that is very patient and ignores the fillers but instead concentrate on other aspects of the &quot;story&quot;. The first half of the series isn&#039;t one of the best ways to start off this originally hyped series. The &quot;story&quot; moves like a turtle and the apple pie is losing its touch. It&#039;s not too surprising that J.C. Staff&#039;s expectations didn&#039;t live up to the hype. <br />
<br />
With all the filler episodes going on and the &quot;story&quot; moving so damn slow, it&#039;s no surprise that some people have dropped it. There should be limits on how to start a potential series but in this case, Arcana wasted it. It brings up boring sequences from the get go and fails to deliver anything unique to the viewers. While the art and music/Op song does somewhat makes up for this, it so far is anything but special. J.C. Staff you disappoint. No one likes reading an autobiography and especially of a series that originally had potential. <br />
<br />

    La Storia Della Arcana Famiglia, or just Arcana Famiglia is one of those shows that when the new season came along, I read the synopsis and became fairly interested in it. I&#039;m generally not the kind of person who tends to discriminate on anime based upon genre so I had no problem watching something labeled as shoujo, however, I became somewhat hesitant when I learned that it was based of an otome game aimed at young girls. (Please note that I have not played the game; I have only watched the anime.) Despite my hesitation, I watched the first episode and found it to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review73303">
        enjoyable. It was enjoyable enough that I showed my little sister it as well (who is a preteen and definitely within the target audience); she enjoyed it and from then on we watched it together.<br />
<br />
The concept of the Arcana powers and the characters seemed interesting based off the the first episode. There was a lot of action in the first episode and the premise of a family-wide contest for the position of Papa (the big boss) and the protagonist&#039;s, Felicita&#039;s, hand in marriage was interesting as well. It provided a dilemma for her that would allow her to develop as a character while defending her right to choose who she marries. It had potential- in fact, the entire series had potential. Unfortunately, the series never comes close to fulfilling the potential it initially held with the protagonist remaining static and boring throughout and the event that I expected to span most of the series, the Duello, only spans the last episode and that itself was a disappointment, much like the rest of the series.<br />
<br />
First, let&#039;s talk about character development. There is none- well, nothing really besides an introduction to most of the characters. They never really delve deep into any one character. In fact, the most developed character is not the protagonist; the most developed characters are the two main male leads, Liberta and Nova who are in love with the protagonist. Even though they are the most developed I could never bring myself to really remotely care about them- I frankly found them annoying. In fact, the only thing I found interesting about the both of them was Liberta&#039;s mysterious Arcana Power. Felicita seemed less of a protagonist and more of a side character the entire series, only speaking when necessary and often seeming to go out of character by being overly-concerned or over-emotional only when the situation demands. (And her Arcana power is clearly just a tool made for the game&#039;s romances.)<br />
<br />
The second topic of discussion is the art and animation. The art was nothing spectacular to me, however it did its job- most of the time. The characters never really looked bad, even the background characters seemed to be drawn well (besides the occasional derp character), however what really suffered was the background itself. I noticed several instances of just plain bad background art and the one in particular that really bugged me wasn&#039;t even noticed by me at first; it was noticed by my sister. A pirate ship in one of the episodes actually changed in art style at least three times in the same episode (and it really wasn&#039;t drawn well in the first place). Besides the art itself, the animation was not very good for the parts where it should have been good, namely the fight scenes. The fights seemed more like gifs that were just repeated at different times and at one point in the last episode, Nova&#039;s shoulder was definitely in a strange position.<br />
<br />
The sound of the anime serves its purpose but does little else, it does not excel in any aspect. I personally like the opening song much better than the ending song, mostly because the guys can&#039;t sing.<br />
<br />
Overall, I don&#039;t have much good to say about this anime. With each passing episode, I prayed that it would get better. Unfortunately, my prayers were never answered; its potential having been completely wasted. This anime is bad; my sister, a member of the target audience, does not think that this show is good. If there was anything redeemable about the series, it would have to be the supporting cast because the main characters are all flat, boring, annoying, or a combination of all three.<br />
<br />
4/10 <br />

    Ooh Arcana Famiglia. I really wanted to enjoy this series...and to begin with, I actually did.<br />
<br />
The setup was sublime. A mafia-esque vigilante organisation, known as The Family, is dedicated to protecting the port town of Regalo. Many members of the Family have made deals with the &quot;Arcana&quot;, granting them abilities based on different tarot cards. Okay, interesting...<br />
<br />
The head of the family announces he wishes to retire from his role and choose an heir by means of a grand tournament, in which all Family members with Arcana powers must duel until only the victor remains, who will become the new &quot;Papa&quot; of the family...and have his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review78796">
        daughter Felicite&#039;s hand in marriage. Felicite violently objects to this sudden announcement, but has no way out of it unless she either wins the tournament herself, or the new Head of the Family grants her freedom.<br />
<br />
Felicite&#039;s two close friends, the rebellious Liberta and the moody Nova, both agree to grant Felicte&#039;s freedom if either of them win the tournament...even though both of them appear to share feelings for the girl, and constantly compete for her approval.<br />
<br />
It was a great setup, with a solid concept and characters that weren&#039;t wholly original, but mostly likeable. The style is crisp with a pleasant colour scheme that gives is a classy but lively atmosphere.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, in time it became clear that the series suffers from two CRIPPLING faults:<br />
<br />
1) Felicite is NOT a protagonist. A protagonist is supposed to be a driving force the moves the plot forward and who&#039;s actions are most influential to the story. However, Felicite, whilst certainly the FOCUS, does not exert any kind of force on the plot. She stands around, looks cutely puzzled or asks questions, and doesn&#039;t actually do anything unless promted to do so by another character. And it does beg the question: Why does she consider independence so valuable when she seems incapable of making independent decisions? Why is she so bothered about losing her freedom when she seems quite happy to just do what everyone tells her to do anyway? Now, this COULD have been an incredibly original and fascinating approach to a tired concept, and raised questions about the value of freedom for freedom&#039;s sake, or if there&#039;s any shame in admitting when you can&#039;t live the independent life you desire. Unfortunately it eventually became apparent that Felicite was just a poorly written protagonist with all the impact of a wet flannel, and hinging dangerously on looking like a fan-made Mary Sue.<br />
<br />
2) And by far worse: The series seems to be under the delusion that just MENTIONING a good idea is enough to constitute entertainment. It&#039;s...honestly a very unusual habit. It will bring up a fascinating concept or a promising plot point and then...forget about it. Case in point: The Family is referred to as a kind of vigilante organisation, and yet we barely see ANY vigilante activity throughout the whole series, they just become a bunch of characters in suits for no reason. Similarly, many of the arcana powers are mentioned, but go entirely unused. Even the tournament, which is set up as the main concept, is forgotten about until the end of the whole series!! But perhaps the most shocking example of this is when one character reveals an experiment he&#039;s been working on...I&#039;ll keep spoilers out of it, but suffice to say it is a pretty major project with staggering ethical ramifications and with massive potential effects on the whole Arcana concept. What happens to this experiment? Never mentioned or alluded to again. Ever. In any form. Like I said, the series believes that it just needs to mention a good idea to get an audience&#039;s attention, and then either forgets to follow through with it or doesn&#039;t believe it needs to. Some backstories never come to fruition, ideas are never explored, and a mass of potential is painfully squandered.<br />
<br />
So, combine a weak protagonist with some extremely clumsy &quot;idea-only&quot; storytelling, and an entire tournament that feels like it was forgotten about and then slapped togehter at the last minute...and you can imagine that the ending of this show didn&#039;t leave me with a good taste in my mouth.<br />
<br />
This show had so much potential, soo muuuch!! The setup was golden, the concept presented lots of possibilities, and most of the characters (Felicite aside) were actually very likeable and interesting, especially Debito, Pace and Luca. Even the humour, which is often a weak aspect in most anime, was pretty solid, either focusing on amusing character interactions or some well-timed slapstick. I also loved the picturesque, European design of Regalo, which created a very distinct setting.<br />
<br />
But ultimately, all that was good about Arcana Famiglia was quickly buried by the efforts of overly-excited writers throwing in plot points and ideas without bothering to think how they&#039;d tie into the story and how they&#039;d resolve.<br />
<br />
A promising start that came to a bitter, frustrating end, and is only enjoyable on its most shallow level.

    Bujorno everyone! Now I&#039;ve completed this 12 episode rip-off, I think it is now time to make a review as to how disgusted I am with this kind of anime. Ok, so the story of this rip-off thing is about a family of well-loved thugs in the island of Regalo, where it is rule by  Mondo a well respected warlord - hey, I like calling him that and besides he does act like one, going back to business the island itself according to MAL&#039;s forum is constantly being invaded either by neighboring city states of Italy or criminal syndicates who wants to be the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review72563">
        big bosses of the island . Mondo&#039;s enforcers are composed of men in black with Arcana powers and I probably need not mention them, anyway the plot of this anime is about Mondo announcing  the opening of the so called &quot;Arcana Duello&quot; where he will award his daughter&#039;s hand in marriage and also replace him as the &quot;Papa&quot; of Arcana Famiglia........or at least that&#039;s what it was suppose to be, what we have instead is a series of episode with its own plot. The mentioned genre; Action, romance, mafia and supernatural didn&#039;t lived up as to what is expected, instead this anime revolves around a reverse harem that exist between Fecita, Liberta and Nova, so for the story I&#039;m giving a a &quot;Poor&quot; number 3. That&#039;s because the story doesn&#039;t apply to the anime itself instead it was poorly divided among its episode. <br />
<br />
Art: Mediocre 5.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m no art critic.<br />
<br />
Sound: Good 7.<br />
<br />
I kind like the opening theme and I also find Felicita&#039;s  voice very cute.  <br />
<br />
Character, enjoyment and overall: Poor 3<br />
<br />
I really didn&#039;t like the way that the director of this anime wasted the talents of the characters, the director,Chiaki Kon could&#039;ve used the characters potential relating to the fact that this anime has an action genre in it and the duello would have provided a nice entertainment for this anime, but alas the duello of the cast were done in the very last episode of this anime and quite frankly we audience were left hanging on the expected &quot;Arcana Duello.&quot; In fact the character&#039;s themselves where confined to do a kind of soap opera/ adventure thingy which make the enjoyment frustrating, I really didn&#039;t like the overall of this 12 episode thingy co&#039;z at the first episode is a teaser makes one to think that this anime is gonna be awesome, but as you go on one would wonder as to what is taking the &quot;Arcana Duello&quot; so long, in the end this anime has turned us audience in an &quot;Il Matto&quot; which means &quot;fool&quot; in Latin, overall this anime is a &quot;RIP-OFF!&quot;   <br />

    *Note: Due to a previous review I wrote, I am acknowledging beforehand that I have not read the visual novel. I am reviewing this anime solely on it&#039;s own story rather than it&#039;s accuracy as an adaptation.<br />
<br />
I have to admit, Arcana Famiglia is probably the most disappointing anime that I have seen this year. It&#039;s probably not the worst but DEFINITELY the most disappointing. It&#039;s got a good cast of characters and there&#039;s certainly nothing wrong with the artwork, music, or voice acting...however, a complete lack of story and the missed opportunity to show off the shonen aspect of this anime just derailed it.<br />
<br />
Overall, I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review72547">
        thought the strongest aspects of this anime was it&#039;s music and characters. The music fit the tone of the anime extremely well. It did have a very Italian feel to the music and I thought the OP and ED songs were very good as well. The only thing I would argue is the OP song didn&#039;t help my disappointment because it gave the feel that this was going to be an action-packed full-throttle anime and it turned out to be the exact opposite. <br />
<br />
As for the characters, on the whole I thought they were pretty good. The characters on the whole were pretty likable. One of the few beefs that I did have with the characters was actually the lead herself, Felicita. Her character seemed so bland. I normally wouldn&#039;t have a problem with this if she were a side character, but the fact of the matter is this story revolved around her and her choices. Due to the lack of character with her, it became difficult to become invested in her. If Liberta or Nova were the main protagonist (which this anime gave some early direction to), it would&#039;ve been much more tolerable. Those two characters seemed to have an interesting back story and appealing characteristics. Even the side characters such as Pace, Debito, Luca, Jolly, Dante, etc. had more character than Felicita. Overall, I thought all the side characters were solid...just the lead character was lacking.<br />
<br />
The weakest part of this anime as aforementioned is the story. This story is just dreadful. However, to be honest, some aspects of it don&#039;t seem so bad. I did like the concept of Felicita having two arcana powers and using both of them together (in a sense) has the ability to save her father. I do actually find that pretty interesting. Therein lies the problem...that is the only interesting thing about this anime. This series basically opens up with Mondo announcing that they will be holding an Arcana Duello to determine who the next leader of the Arcana Famiglia will be. Okay, sounds like your typical shonen anime plot. So what happens over the next 11 episodes? We slowly and barely learn about Liberta and Nova&#039;s back story, how they can&#039;t control their powers and how they must slowly learn to control them before the Arcana Duello. Even then, that content actually takes up MAYBE 3 episodes...the rest of it is essentially character development padding. What I mean by that is, it&#039;s essentially padding since they are repeating similar events to show off each character&#039;s personality. It ends up mostly being a waste of time since we don&#039;t learn any more about the characters than we already know.<br />
<br />
Since the story was weak, surely the shonen-esque action sequences will surely make up for it, right? Actually, wrong. The action sequences in this anime were extremely weak and extremely poorly animated. There are even sequences where action scenes (especially in the final episode) aren&#039;t shown entirely or there are scenes where characters are fighting but you&#039;re seeing the expressions and thoughts of a spectator instead of the actual fight. It seemed as though the producers of this anime didn&#039;t trust their animators enough with action sequences that they just used this to cover up for it. It was a poor move and was extremely noticeable. <br />
<br />
My overall thoughts on Arcana Famiglia is it had my interest piqued in the beginning, but as the series wore on, so did my expectations. It missed out on so many opportunities that it&#039;s hard to classify this anime. I&#039;d call it a shonen but the action sequences were non-existent. I&#039;d call it a romance but any time a romance was hinted at, it was brushed aside for more meaningless padding. I&#039;d call it a drama but it really wasn&#039;t very dramatic. This anime essentially has no identinty and it really wouldn&#039;t shock me if I forget that I even watched this anime at one point. It really was that forgettable.<br />

    I was very happy when i begin watching this, and the first episode caught me. The mafia thing isn&#039;t that original, but the idea to bind that with tarot cards with powers. That was an unexpected thing to me, and made me to watch. Like I said in other posts : Never judge a anime by its first episode, the sentence applys to this. First episode was good, others : Ehhh<br />
<br />
I liked some characters, but the story didn&#039;t help to develop them. And the whole plot turned boring. When i was almost finishing, i thought things would change, but i got disappointed another time.<br />

    Arcana famiglia: An anime that has a good premise, but its lieing to you. its not what it makes it self out to be in the first episode. i honestly thought i found something interesting when i learned this anime was about a mafia tournament. the thing is, in the next  10 episodes just pussy foot around and doesnt get to the tournament until the last episode. And then, it delivers one of the worst endings i have ever seen. Today I review: La Storia della Arcana Famiglia<br />
<br />
Story: The story of arcana famiglia at episode 2 starts as a &quot;who will we save today&quot;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review112625">
        or &quot; whose past sill we learn about today&quot; .  I might have been fine with this if i was only in the beginning . The thing is, they&#039;re not executed well. i found myself not immeresed in the story except for a few plot secrets the show had to offer, and when these where explaned, i expected more. The worst part was they hype up this big tournament episdode 1 and never get there till the end. Overall the story is much to be desired. 3/10<br />
<br />
Art: This show honestly has a unique art style and gets credit for that. that was one of the big reason i even watched the show. It is very fluid and looks very nice in the actions scenes it has. 8/10<br />
<br />
Sound: this is an interesting department for the show, as it sounds great, but never really sticks out. the Opening is something u might actaully watch instead of skipping it every episode. 7/10<br />
<br />
Character: L0l@!. the most interesting characters were the ones who never got enough screen time, and while the main characters have some interest, they never truely get developed. they just do what one might expect and nothing really more. that being said, i did like some of the characters 4/10<br />
<br />
enjoyment: The only reason i enjoyed this anime even a little is the animation. It just fits the anime . when it come to my enjoyment of the story I kept hoping for more than the show actaully delivered to me. by the end i lost hope and was dissastified. the animation  and some of the comedy in the anime is really the only redeming factor for my enjoyment. 5/10<br />
<br />
<br />
overall: this anime i would put below average and rate it with BAD. the pacing was terrible in the last episode ant left me feeling, &quot;why didnt u span this over the 2nd half of the series. if they had a tournament 6 episodes long. and spent the first  5 episodes with hardcore training, this show could have been something awesome. but overall, it just fails to deliver. 4/10<br />

    La storia della Arcana Famiglia, most known by, simply, Arcana Famiglia, is a mafia anime. It&#039;s a so much interesting theme, don&#039;t you think? All these men with suits, guns and power atmosphere. All their mystery and charm, inherent of a mafia member surely will come with good characters and great stories, yeah? Yeah, the characters are great but the story... Uh... Keep reading and you will know what I&#039;m talking...<br />
<br />
In begining, you&#039;re introduced to Felicitá, the only daughter of Mondo, the mafia chef in Regalo island. This place has a lot of beauty and a safe population because the mafia efforts are much effective.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review89635">
        But the members of this mafia have something more special than guns and knifes, they have Arcana powers, some type of magic controlled by emotions. Each Arcana power is based on a Tarocco card and Felicitá, our protagonist, has the power of Gli Amanti, the power of heart. She&#039;s a courageous and pretty girl, but she can&#039;t decide her own destiny because her father announced the Arcana Duello, a duel for all the Arcana users to decide who will be the next chef and who will marry Felicitá.<br />
<br />
There is many guys wanting to win the Arcana Duello, specially Nova and Libertá. Nova is my favorite character, he&#039;s serious, shy and dedicated. Libertá is his opposite, funny, outgoing and irresponsible. They&#039;re Felicitá&#039;s best friends and their relationship are pretty well. Between them and Felicitá, of course. Nova and Libertá are mortal enemies. Another characters, like Luca, Felicitá&#039;s majordomo, Pace and Debito have funny moments and deep personalities. And Dante and Jolly too. I can bet that the characters will enchant you because I think that is the better point of this anime. My grade is 8, yeah!<br />
<br />
The art and sounds are bad. Yeah, I think they worked in low budget all this time and didn&#039;t get a good result in this side. I can&#039;t see a good match with the music and the rest of anime... Argh, I will not comment more nothing about this. Next topic.<br />
<br />
But the story is fair, we have a interesting plot, there&#039;s something uncommon in animes here: a girl with a lot of guys! (In the most, there is opposite, no?)<br />
If you are waiting action, give up. But if you want see good characters facing troubles and having fun, keep going.<br />
<br />
Arcana Famiglia is fun and that&#039;s all. A good distraction, a few episodes and a weekend of adventures are waiting for you. My overall is 6 and that&#039;s not bad. I hope I helped you with this review.

    This is one of the best anime I have seen in a long time it has a great story, romance, its funny, and it keeps you wanting to watch more. I am not that into fighting animes but this one is so good I could not emagin people not liking this anime.

    When I heard that the otome game was becoming an anime, I was so excited. I really loved the Arcana Famiglia otome game, it really was so much fun. And I was hoping for a faithful adaptation of it.<br />
<br />
Why thank you, J.C. Staff, for giving us the exact opposite.<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
<br />
While the story itself may seem good at first, don&#039;t be fooled. At least, in the anime, it starts off as side stories, kind of. They&#039;re kind of like minor events in the story. But the problem here is that it doesn&#039;t really improve. Without spoiling anyone who wants to watch this, it doesn&#039;t really amount

          <span style="display: none;" id="review74635">
        to anything in the end. There&#039;s a lot of talk about friendship and bonds and stuff like that, and it seems as if a lot of the action happens off stage. I don&#039;t know, but there&#039;s something definitely lacking here. While it is interesting, you can laugh here and there, it&#039;s definitely not as good as the otome game. <br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
<br />
The art is, in my opinion, one of the commendable bits of the anime. While the anime is not amazing itself, the art is pretty good. Not comparable to the otome game, but it&#039;s still good. Although, I felt like I saw a few derpy faces here and there, but they were few and far between, so I didn&#039;t really mind. But the reason it&#039;s a seven and not an eight is because of the backgrounds. The backgrounds were recycled way too many times. While the animation itself was flash at first, I felt like it was only like that in the OP (and the ED is just some still motion pictures from the otoge). I felt kind of like the fluidity of the animation in the anime was watered down as the anime progressed, and that was really disappointing as well.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
<br />
Despite the story, the seiyuus did an amazing job. They are the same seiyuus from the game, and maybe I&#039;m a little biased because of that, but I still feel as if they did a good job. The OP and the ED were nice to listen to as well. Again, there was the case of reusing the same track again and again towards the end.<br />
<br />
Character: 5<br />
<br />
THIS is it. This is where the shit hits the fan. And the problem relies mostly with the main character, our lovely Felicita. Now they tried to make a badass out of her, but failed when her inability to speak was discovered. While this is not so much of a problem in the otoge, this is a problem in the anime. Why does she even need a seiyuu? When given a chance to speak, Fel only asks, &quot;What&#039;s wrong?&quot; Or of course, the ever so famous &quot;C-could it be...?!&quot; Could it be WHAT? TELL me what it could be! I WANT TO KNOW. Now typically I wouldn&#039;t mind the &quot;C-could it be...?!&quot; but if the character follows it up with some kind of explanation or the other. However, every time Fel says that, she does not follow it up. In fact, she just stands there like a log. <br />
<br />
The side characters were much more interesting, to be honest. Especially the Pace, Luca and Debito trio. If JCS had based the anime off these three, they would have gotten a lot more material for the anime itself.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7<br />
<br />
In the end, it was okay I suppose. It was definitely not the best thing I&#039;ve ever seen, because every time I think about this anime, I&#039;m going to remember how amazing the otoge was and be thoroughly disappointed. There were some times that I laughed, but other than that, not really. It was really just meh.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6<br />
<br />
In the end, this felt like a really crap commercial for the otoge. I cannot say JCS did a good job with this. JCS has had quite a few good adaptations, but they&#039;ve also had quite a few bad ones, and this is one of them. I cannot say I loved this, it was enjoyable at times. It was really disappointing, however. Those of you who have not played the otoge, I suggest you play it; it is about a million times better than this.

         Yare yare~ All I can say is that I had really high hopes for this anime but NOOOOOOO they just had to make it into a crappy slice of life anime ughhhh what&#039;s the point of even mentioning the duello and the mafia. If they were to make into anime they should&#039;ve just made it into a normal sparkly shoujo anime like it is without the supernatural powers and mafia. REALLY HOW IS THIS EVEN MAFIA. MAFIA IS KILLING, FIGHTING, ACTION,  if you wanna see a real MAFIA go and watch Baccano and Katekyo Hitman Reborn, heck even Durarara

          <span style="display: none;" id="review81712">
        is closer to mafia. Really don&#039;t even compare this to all the other beasty ass mafia anime like KHR and Baccano. <br />
      And the characters UGHHHHH THE CHARACTERS the designs are really good but the MCs can they even be considered MCs? The 2 guys are so cliched and Fel doesn&#039;t even have personality. Honestly I liked everyone else, even the side characters better.<br />
      And the Duello was only one day? WTF? I mean even IRL duels,tournament (fighting ones) take at least 3 days at least. This anime was a waste of time I&#039;m a girl and did not enjoy this heck I&#039;d rather get my ass in the kitchen.

    I really wanted to like this anime. The first episode I watched gave me hope that this would be a good anime and so I decided to stick around, now I don&#039;t know if I should have. <br />
<br />
Basically there are 3 main characters. Nova, the katana wielding special forces guy in the Arcana family, he&#039;s a pretty serious looking guy from the outside, but he&#039;s got his soft spots for certain people. Probably the more mature one of the 3 mains. Next is Liberta who is your typical goofball that always ALWAYS follows his heart and doesn&#039;t really think things through. He&#039;s impulsive, but hides

          <span style="display: none;" id="review72537">
        a secret apparently. Then you have Felicita who&#039;s kind of independent, feels a sense love towards her comrades, but we&#039;re not really told if she has some kind of love interest in the other main characters. There&#039;s a number of other characters, but they&#039;re not explored deep into so they&#039;re not really that important. <br />
If I had to choose the most interesting one, it would probably be Nova? Why? You can relate to him to an extent that makes you care for him. Liberta is probably the weakest imho, his reasons just seem rather shallow so you end up (I did) rooting against him. Felicita well..she ends up being the love interest let&#039;s just say.<br />
<br />
The storyline is somewhat strange to be honest. It tries to focus on this Duello or Duel that would reward the winner with Felicitas hand and of course any wish they want. This sounds great to start. Heck I love duels, who doesn&#039;t? Well from there you get to know the main characters better. A few episodes are spent on developing their chemistry, histories, etc, but then there seems to be some fillers in between in my opinion which detracts from the story, though I really like the focus on the characters, still the story line didn&#039;t really seem solid. I felt like it was missing something. It felt more like a harem with just better characters, if I could explain the feeling when I watched this anime. The Duello? That? It was plain garbage. I was so disappointed in the battles (they didn&#039;t even show all of them and the important ones they just put up crap), I was like man that&#039;s it? So disappointing. To top it off through out the episodes you were being let on to believe that Felicita would choose who she liked....well let me just tell you you&#039;re gonna be disappointed with the outcome. Hell I was. A LOT of people were. <br />
<br />
In the end the anime had some potential. I thought the main characters were good, but that terrible story line and ending just completely bring down this anime. I really wanted to like it, but it just plain disappointed me. It ended up being almost garbage. 3 out of 10.

    After elegantly spectating the complex maze which subsides in the harem genre, meeting a reverse-harem anime immediately triggered an alarm in my head. The usual problem with the Harem Genre is the stupidity which the main male protagonist simultaneously seems to preveal. Just when you think it can&#039;t get any frustrating, it just gets worse. <br />
<br />
The Reverse-Harem Genre seems like it could be just as bad. However, assuming is also considerably naive.<br />
<br />
The plot of Arcana Famiglia resides in a very unique setting, where seemingly superantural themes are just being thrown randomly. Actually, it is. The central plot is the result of anime trying to adapt

          <span style="display: none;" id="review67493">
        other cultures, and in this case, the Italians. The story centers around a Female named Felicita, who is a fine piece of &#039;ss by herself, and the plot basically sets up an indirect reverse harem of many guys chasing after her. It&#039;s more enjoyable than expected due to all the characters&#039; foolish actions...<br />
<br />
ahh running out of time so...<br />
<br />
Characters create a fine atmosphere, aren&#039;t as frustrating as most harems. Developments are bond to happen between characters.<br />
<br />
This anime should be listed as a slice of life, because that&#039;s all that&#039;s been happening. I recommend this to be picked up by romance/harem fans.<br />
<br />
Hacked by Nova.

    This is not a spoiler free review. But trust me this Anime&#039;s not even worth your care to not be spoiled. If anything please don&#039;t waste your 12*25 minutes with this series. <br />
<br />
This series is just horrid. Like holy moly is it bad. <br />
<br />
I actually was really looking forward to this one since Fukuyama Jun was playing a main and the character design (visually-wise) is actually pretty good. I really regret my decision to get into this. <br />
<br />
My overall experience was just this constant irritation. Irritation because I can literally predict every singe thing that was gonna happen. This is mainly because the characters in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204887">
        this Anime are, in every sense of the phrase, one-dimensional. It&#039;s that bad. I predicted every moment the Nova was gonna say &quot;Don&#039;t call me a chickpea&quot; I know Felicita wasn&#039;t going to save Papa. I predicted the punch Liberta gave Nova at the end and then they&#039;re going to be buddy buddy again with Liberta extending his hand out with a side of an extra hand from Felicita. There&#039;s just no interesting thing about this Anime ! I&#039;m fine with cliches but when you can predict the freaking dialogue ? Oh god help me...<br />
<br />
The powers are also just badly done I&#039;m annoyed at the situation where Pink Haired girl was losing her memories to save Papa and then Jolly the suspicious guy&#039;s power is &quot;to forcefully bring back her memories&quot;. Like thank F*CK for that convenience !! There&#039;s no showing, just a bunch of telling which absolutely mundane. Also what&#039;s the beef with Jolly anyways if you guys know his powers was to do that ? <br />
<br />
I also would like to point out that this series is like a scam to scam away your time (and my condolences to anyone who bought even a cheap Chinese CD of this). The first episode got you into thinking this Anime is going to be mostly about this Tournament between powered people and people sorting out their dramas, discovering things about themselves and such. Then in the next 10 episodes it has absolutely nothing, like really nothing. You&#039;ll get told the main characters past with no showing, you get your time wasted on things like Cat finding and Chasing and telling children scary stories and you&#039;ll keep asking yourself &quot;Where the heck is the tournament with all the action packed fighting ??&quot; Finally you get there in the very last episode and they literally treat 3 of the main characters like side characters. Felicita kicks their ass but of course we don&#039;t get to see it because the Director and Animators were lazy and decided &quot;We&#039;re just going to show them running to Felicita then skip to the scene where they get depressed from losing&quot;. <br />
<br />
I was hoping for this series to be one of those short but interesting anime like Hataraku Maou-sama. I REALLY wanted to like this Anime but it is just disappointment. It&#039;s lazy, it&#039;s a waste of time and it is undoubtedly the WORST waste of potential I&#039;ve ever seen.

    I had really high hopes for this series.<br />
<br />
Though it is rated as a shoujo anime it has a lot of shonen elements in it.<br />
<br />
The main characters are two boys, Liberta and Nova and one girl, Felicita, which also represent the main romance part of the story, which is based on a love triangle.<br />
<br />
Felicita which should be the main protagonist is the least recognizable character of the show. She is barely established as a unique character and seems replacable.<br />
<br />
Liberta and Nova both have had emotionally crippling events in their past which they have to overcome in order to protect what is dearest to them, their love

          <span style="display: none;" id="review72581">
        to Felicita.<br />
<br />
It is far easier to identify with one of those two boys as you really care for them and grow to like them as the real protagonists of the show.<br />
<br />
Maybe this is only caused by me being male myself and i just don&#039;t understand the depth of a character Felicita presents but i doubt it.<br />
<br />
The first episode is totally missleading as you would think that the whole anime would be centered around a great tournament, the arcana duello, perhaps with fights between the contestants staged between the character development episodes to show how much they have grown while constantly throwing new challenges at them.<br />
<br />
This was the anime i expected but it turned out completely different.<br />
<br />
Without ever announcing when or how this duello was to take place it turned into a bit of a sleight of life anime showing the daily life of the characters and focussing on their weaknesses and how they try to overcome them.<br />
<br />
The character design is excellent with a few exceptions (Felicita being one of them).<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed the group of the slightly older members, Pace, Debito and Luca which all had very unique characteristica which resulted from their various pasts that are in a way all linked to each other.<br />
<br />
I simply loved the voice acting of Yoshino, Hiroyuki as Debito and the voices chosen for the other characters perfectly fit with them too.<br />
<br />
The anime in itself is fun to watch and there are a lot of sideplots involving the other characters, expecially Jolly.<br />
<br />
But all that builds up to nothing as the last episode smashes everything the writers have build up over the first 11 episodes into peaces.<br />
<br />
The anime is clearly build to have a much larger set of episodes dedicated to it resuting in a grand finale, the arcano duello resolving the last of the subplots and ending in a decision for Felicita wether she will choose Liberta or Nova.<br />
<br />
But it seems like the anime got discontinued on short notice making the 12th episode the final one.<br />
<br />
I have not read the correlating manga this anime is based on but by the pacing up till episode 11 i would guess we were storylike at least half-way through of what the manga has to offer.<br />
<br />
The main story was shortened as much as possible to fit it all in one final episode leaving behind all of the subplots and further character development.<br />
<br />
It is just a fast forward through the story to show what would have happened, which it also shows that there is no second season planned as they just could have left the story open for continuation should it be needed.<br />
<br />
This also renders the show uncomplete and unsatisfactory. Though i enjoyed the anime pretty much up to this last episode i can only advise anyone planning to watch this anime not to do so unless you want to be really disappointed.<br />
<br />
If you watch the last episode you don&#039;t even get the chance to just read the manga instead because it contains major spoilers for upcoming events (if it isn&#039;t an alternate ending).<br />
<br />
If you really want to watch this series you should stop after episode 11 and pick up the manga for continuation.<br />
<br />
As i said before i have not read the manga so far but from the storytelling and the good character-development i&#039;m pretty sure that it will deliver a good enough experience and to be honest it can&#039;t be worse than the ending of the anime.

    Disclaimer: Going into this I had no idea that this anime was based of a game<br />
<br />
I will be frank, this was not a good anime plot-wise. It plays a sly trick by making the first episode good therefore drawing you in. Afterwards you was maybe 2 or 3 hours hoping the show gets better and it doesn&#039;t. The show does have it&#039;s good point though.<br />
<br />
Story-3<br />
<br />
It seems like a very decent story at first but then the shows goes off on some tangent that is, IMO, unrelated to the plot presented in the first episode.In its attempt to evoke a emotional response from the audience it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review78872">
        fall face first.<br />
<br />
Art-7<br />
<br />
The artwork was very decent, one of the few highlights of this show. Character designs were very good.<br />
<br />
Sound-6<br />
<br />
Voice acting was very good, also a highlight. OP and ED were not to my liking but that is personal preference.<br />
<br />
Character-8<br />
<br />
I love the characters. From their design to the voices and their personalities. On of the main things that kept me hooked for 6 painful episodes.<br />
<br />
Overall it was an anime that I found had a lot of potential but suffered poor execution. Never judge a book by its cover.

    Here are some Q&amp;A to help you get a grasp at what the anime is like. (SPOILER ALERT....kind of.)<br />
<br />
What kind of ending does Arcana Famiglia have?<br />
A: A round about way to end. No progression in relationship with other characters what so ever.<br />
<br />
How is the action/violence in the anime?<br />
A: Yeah..... lame sword fighting..... thats it...... (Unless you want to include the powers which they don&#039;t use what so ever.)<br />
<br />
Who is the antagonist?<br />
A: What antagonist?<br />
<br />
Ok, here&#039;s the actual review:<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
It starts of near a city next to the ocean where a &quot;clan&quot; lives. They all have superpowers that hold great power. The head of the family wants his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review183106">
        daughter to marry someone in the clan. The winner of a fighting contest will be able to marry daughter of the head. The result was.......pathetic. The majority of this anime was just background info on every main and supporting characters.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Average art in my opinion. It&#039;s not bad but not so spectacular.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Music was fine. Able to dramatize the situation the characters were caught in. Again nothing really that spectacular. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
This was suppose to be amazing. They had awesome superpowers from a deck of god cards. They were suppose to use these cards agains evil!!! These characters COULD have brought this anime to the top, but did they? NO! All they did was random and pointless stuff. Their bonds might have deepen between themselves, but definitely not with the viewers of this anime. Because of their lack of &quot;motivation and moving forward and stuff&quot; I gave them a 4 instead of the 9 which they could have gotten to make this anime 400x better.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
If you could;t tell already I had to push myself to finish this anime. It was lame. End of story.
