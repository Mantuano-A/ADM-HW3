    &quot;How can we make the most unsatisfying ending possible, while still technically concluding something?&quot;<br />
<br />
I am convinced that this is what the directors/writers/whoever asked themselves when making this film.<br />
<br />
Sora no Otoshimono Final: Eternal My Master is a film that replaced the would-be third season of Sora no Otoshimono, an anime I find sadly underrated. It&#039;s often cast aside as yet another pile of trash fanservice, when in fact it has an incredibly deep storyline, as well as fantastic emotion and drama. SnO Final forgets about all of that-- no, they deliberately ignore it in this mess of a film.<br />
<br />
The SnO manga had mountains of story left

          <span style="display: none;" id="review159059">
        to tell. A third season would have barely managed to fit all of that in, but it was still possible. When it was confirmed that we were getting a second film instead, that dream was crushed. Yet there was still hope. Towards its end the anime deviated from the manga, making it possible that this new movie might provide a unique ending while still borrowing key elements from the source material. We were worried, but we had faith. What we got, however, was nothing of the sort.<br />
<br />
The movie begins with Ikaros&#039; dramatic climax from the second-to-last chapter. Immediately this is unsettling; there was no way they could fit the massive final arc and all of its setup into this 50 minute timeblock. The scene progresses, and ends approximately where the chapter does. It then cuts away to several months prior, a typical day at the Sakurai household. From this point to the penultimate scene, the film is nothing but random filler chapters meshed together to create a bastardization of the romantic progression between Ikaros and Tomoki. Chapters are placed where they don&#039;t belong for no rhyme or reason, important plot points are tweaked to move along this clusterfuck of a story, and the supporting cast is reduced to comic relief and pointless exposition. But this isn&#039;t even the worst offense. Consistently, the film teases all of the major plotlines. ALL of them! And what do we get from it? NOTHING!! Absolutely nothing, as if to say &quot;All this cool stuff happened, but you don&#039;t get to see it.&quot; I may not speak for everyone, but I for one was offended by this. This movie&#039;s lack of care for the audience&#039;s appreciation of detail was insulting. In the end, Ikaros&#039; dramatic climax concludes, and the movie ends... bitter, and incomplete.<br />
<br />
One may argue that speaking from the point of view of somebody who read the manga is unfair, and that I should take it as a piece of the anime and nothing more. Ok, let&#039;s try that.<br />
<br />
Right off the bat I have no clue what&#039;s going on. What is Zeus? Why are they attacking it? What happened to Nymph and Sugata? Where is everybody else? Why is the world falling apart?<br />
All of these questions come from the first scene alone, and the rest of the movie fails to answer any of them. This movie expects you to have read the manga, and is impossible to review from any perspective otherwise. That said, I feel it does an incredible injustice to the manga and its fans, blatantly disregarding everything that made it so special in the first place, just to say they half-assedly resolved their love story.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve seen many disappointing anime in my time, but none are as painful as a disappointing ending to a good anime. Sora no Otoshimono Final: Eternal My Master was just that.

    When the Sora no Otoshimono manga finally ended about half a year ago, I was honestly amazed. Why? Because the ending was absolutely beautiful! Given that this is an ecchi story, the amount of emotional impact the manga conclusion had is still unmatched to me for its genre. Now as a result I was of course very much so looking forward to seeing this finale closing out the anime series as well.<br />
<br />
Now that I&#039;ve seen it however... let&#039;s just say that this &quot;Final&quot; movie doesn&#039;t do the manga justice. At all.<br />
<br />
Assuming that you&#039;ve seen all the prior seasons of Sora no Otoshimono before watching this,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review158953">
        you should already know what to expect. It is the same good old character cast and the same good old perverted yet hilarious sketches. The only thing that really changes for real towards the end is of course the story.<br />
<br />
The word &quot;rushed&quot; is not strong enough for this one. The pacing of Eternal My Master is a mess. It basically rushes through the remaining manga chapters like a runaway train, skipping a huge amount of content in-between, and while many of the key scenes are still adapted, the transition between them isn&#039;t executed well at all. As a result, the story just ends up needlessly hard to follow and the supposed emotional impact misses its mark.<br />
<br />
Above all though, what really let me down was the ending itself. It just wasn&#039;t the same. Literally. The super emotional conclusion the manga had just didn&#039;t exist. Numerous key scenes from the very last chapters simply aren&#039;t there, and the epilogue is straight-up missing. Hell it hardly even properly explains why the ending it *does* have actually happens the way it does. Overall it just doesn&#039;t leave you feeling satisfied at all.<br />
<br />
As a whole, the production value is still good and the girls are still as likable as ever, and really those are the only reasons I&#039;m kind enough to give it a 4 overall. However the story is just incredibly poorly executed and as a result it will only leave you disappointed in the end.<br />
<br />
<br />
TL;DR - Read the manga ending instead, pretend this one doesn&#039;t exist.

    This review will be done in the point of view of someone who hasn&#039;t read any of the manga.<br />
<br />
Story: 4/10<br />
The story was at best decent. If you were expecting something like the scene where Nymph&#039;s master tells her to bring her pet and shit goes down, prepare to be disappointed. The movie has about 5 whole minutes of serious moments, confusing but serious, and then the rest of the movie is filler/fan service. The first few minutes show the world being destroyed and people dying and all this crazy shit happening with no explanation. The beginning and ending was good although it felt confusing. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review142177">
        first few minutes showed promise but they never developed on it. I wasn&#039;t sure if I was missing some plot because I didn&#039;t read the manga but the middle part felt pointless. They do a flash back and show a lot of filler. Characters chilling and talking and making jokes. It didn&#039;t have very much to do with the opening and ending and felt like jokes instead of a serious movie. You could remove most of the middle part and the over story will still be intact. The main poster is Ikaros holding Tomoki while her wings are on fire, I was expecting something badass. The trailer showed all the action scenes and left out all the filler scenes. Instead of watching a movie I paid $10 to watch, it felt like I was watching an OVA. If you wanted a light hearted comedy then this movie will make you happy. I expected a lot more than a comedy and wanted something serious. <br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
The art is still really good. It carries on over from the show. Tomoki looks a little different but not to the point it becomes a problem. Everyone else looks exactly like I remember. Nothing in the movie happened that really let the art shine so I can&#039;t really give it a high score. They used a lot of flash backs within the flash backs, scenes from the show so it was weird seeing Tomoki change back and forth. <br />
<br />
Sound 8/10<br />
The sound is still good just like the show. The sound track is still beautiful as well as the ending song done by Blue Drops. Blue drops has done most of the OPs and EDs of the show and movies, so hearing them return was a nice treat. I recommend everyone check out the end song cause it&#039;s really good. Not much else to say about the soundtrack besides that it was good.<br />
<br />
Character: 7/10<br />
Can&#039;t say much about the characters. Only Ikaros changes a lot, and Tomoki a little. Ikaros has the most character development and we get to see her change from being an emotionless girl to something more interesting. All the other characters seem to stay the same. No one I can remember changed that much. Ikaros became a real character at the end and Tomoki&#039;s relationship between Ikaros and himself grew stronger which was probably the only good thing to come out of this movie. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
I did enjoy it a lot but for different reasons. I wasn&#039;t touched because of it&#039;s touching story. I was mostly just laughing at the jokes and being aroused by the fan service. I was expecting the dark story but got something completely different. Although I wasn&#039;t completely disappointed I wasn&#039;t too happy with it. In my mind I thought shit was gonna go down and people die and tears shed but instead we got 45 minutes of characters running around making a few jokes and Tomoki being perverted.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6/10<br />
I can&#039;t recommend this anime to all Sora no Otoshimono fans. Overall it felt like it could have just been an OVA rather than a movie. I believe the original plan was to make a season 3 but instead made a movie. So instead of having 4 hours of content, they some how managed to shorten it to 49 minutes, and you can guess how that turned out. Maybe I hyped it too much, people were telling me that they were adapting the serious part of the manga and I got a few minutes of that but for the most part it was just jokes which is what I got from the anime. I recommend people just stream it rather than buy it or go watch it in theaters if you are lucky. If you wanted a light hearted story then this is perfect for you. If you wanted more then you don&#039;t have to rush out and see it.

    Watching this anime is like having your girlfriend/boyfriend cheated on you or knowing your best friends stab from the back. In other words, it feels like being betrayed.<br />
<br />
Sora no Otoshimono  Final: Eternal My Master is one of the movie that have been most anticipation and one that have been through so many controversies. One of them is making this one into a movie. The first plan for Sora no Otohimono Final: Eternal My Master is making this into a series format but suddenly. they&#039;re changing it into a movie without any particular reasons. The result? We have a very much rushed and unclear story.<br />
<br />
Sora

          <span style="display: none;" id="review160519">
        no Otoshimono  Final: Eternal My Master taking a place after the first movie, Sora no Otoshimono: Tokeijikake no Angeloid. The story in this movie is mainly focussing on the relation between Tomoki and Ikaros and how their life works after the previous movie and thats it. There isnt any plot and moreover, the whole story is a mess. At the first we have some dramatic scenes between Ikaros and Tomoki then after that we would seeing an usual SnO, which is comedy between the characters but then back again with some dramatic scenes without explaining whats happen with the first dramatic scenes. As the result, the emotional scenes that probably the director wants misses the mark and loses its impacts.<br />
<br />
The other things that should be noticed how this anime doesnt explain anything in the end. As for a &quot;closing&quot;movie to the series, this movie doesnt explain anything like what really Ikaros do in the past? Where is Zeus? What is the black hole that appear in the sky? and  so on. It leaves a big question and bring confused to viewers that doesnt read the manga like me.<br />
<br />
But after all that, there is a good aspects that keep mestill to watch it until the end. It was the fillers. If you&#039;re expecting this anime would &quot;finally&quot; focus solely on serious story, this maybe a letdown. Since, nearly 80% of this movie still have an entertaining and funny scenes like the usual Sora no Otoshimono. The jokes as usual is great and the characters is still fun and lovely to watch. Moreover, the Tomoki&#039;s harem increasing with the presence of Chaos. However, funny scenes like this would confused us with where do they want to bring this anime? A serious one or like the usual one (Rom-com)?<br />
<br />
The art and sound in this anime isn&#039;t much a thing,of course for movie format the quality is a little bit better than the series one but in the end, it doesnt much mean anything while the story is a mess.<br />
<br />
As a fan of Sora no Otoshimono, this movie is surely a disappointing and makes me think what is in the director&#039;s head when making this. Is it a marketing sales so people would buy the manga for knowing what happen or the director just want to make a mess? who knows. Well, i really hope they make another movie or probably series to be a bridge for explaining what happen in this movie.<br />

    I tend to rate things pretty easy, but this movie was a train wreck.<br />
<br />
1 point for taking the correct characters and putting them in the correct setting. 1 point for having a joke good enough to make me chuckle once.<br />
<br />
With everything the series was building up to, this final chapter covered absolutely none of it, threw out random, poorly done fanservice, and ended without wrapping up a single plot thread. <br />
<br />
It literally has no redeeming value.

    Warning : spoilers ahead. For those who don&#039;t want to be spoiled, stay away from this review XD<br />
<br />
Well, where do we start?<br />
<br />
We all knew that there would be some disappointments after watching this movie. When I saw the title, &#039;Final&#039;, I expect something great. Building a story to a good final arc, and giving a good final conclusion. Well, my expectations was not fulfilled at all. But it doesn&#039;t mean this movie was terrible at all, I just feel this shouldn&#039;t be a final movie for Sora no Otoshimono franchise. Fans that only follow the anime (including me) would be extremely disappointed.<br />
<br />
First problem of this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review158721">
        movie is.. the story, or I should say the only problem. At first few minutes (around 5 minutes), we got to see amazing and emotional scenes. It was a good start of the movie. After that suddenly we were shown daily lives in Tomoki&#039;s house. It makes the watcher eager to wait to see how the story goes until that first amazing scenes happened. But.. unfortunately.. we won&#039;t get it. The movie only tells comedic daily lives and interaction between characters until before the emotional final scene.  <br />
<br />
Just by watching this movie, eventhough I haven&#039;t read the manga, I know this movie skipped a lot of chapters. Anime watcher wil really have no idea how the story becomes like that. Honestly, rather than making the movie like that, I think if it would be a final movie, it would be definitely better to adapt the final arc of the manga, even though it would feel rushed.<br />
<br />
Okay, leave the negative points behind (and my personal disappointment T.T), this movie also got good points. For the art, well, it wasn&#039;t improved from the previous series/movie, I think. Or was the previous movie even do a better job (doubt)? Anyway, the animation was pretty good. But too bad we got no battle scene in this movie. For the sound I think the BGM was good, especially when Ikaros flies to synapse. ED song was good too. <br />
<br />
Next, for the characters. Previous characters are back, even Chaos is back. I missed them a little bit. They still have the same personalities.  For character development, we don&#039;t see much, except that we could see emotional side of Ikaros and I like it.<br />
<br />
Now, for the enjoyment. If this movie was actually an OVA and wasn&#039;t a final movie, I could get some good enjoyment. There are some good comedic and touching scenes which I really enjoy. What brings my enjoyment down is that this movie was a final movie. <br />
<br />
Well, overall score from me would be 6. I still don&#039;t understand why they made the final movie like this. Do they want us anime watcher to read the manga? Anyway, this movie is still worth watching and really really make you want to read the manga (I&#039;ll read it immediately after this!!).             <br />
<br />

    Well, what can I say.. I haven&#039;t read the manga. Some months ago, I found out about Heavens Lost Property and watched the series. I was astonished by the plot, the characters and the comedy it offers. Its really a great anime. Then, I found out about the first movie - The clockwork angeloid. It was a nice and emotional movie, however it did not live up to my expectations. And then we got this.. Eternal my master.<br />
<br />
Being one of the very few that have not read the manga, this movie was a disaster. Even though I really had NO idea what was going on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review159751">
        at the first scene, I was confident that they would fill it up somehow.<br />
<br />
Boy, how wrong I was.<br />
<br />
After that scene, we are returned to the classic mood and style of HLP. Some Ecchi&#039;s we all know and love from the series, lots of fun times and that obvious, but entertaining harem part of the anime were all present. I liked the emotional part with Ikaros throughout. However, just after that part of the plot ends, the horror kicked in..<br />
<br />
SPOILER ALERT AHEAD. STOP READING IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED YET. OVERALL, ITS BETTER NOT TO WATCH THE MOVIE IF YOU&#039;VE NOT READ THE MANGA LIKE ME. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.<br />
<br />
To my unpleasant surprise, the first scene continues, and we see Ikaros with Tomoki up in the sky. Ikaros keeps on burning, and Tomoki keeps on screaming for her to go back. Ikaros, out of the blue, tells him she&#039;s in love, and for the first time ever, we see her smile. She throws Tomoki into synapse and she gets destroyed. Then the movie ends.<br />
<br />
Yes. Just like that. Astrea was probably already dead on the first scene, Nymph died at that very time, I have NO idea what zeus is, I dont know why Sugata is hurt, I never learned what happened to the blue-haired girl, I don&#039;t know how Hyiori remained alive, and finally, I have NO IDEA why Ikaros sacrificed herself to get Tomoki into synapse. What hurt me the most is that they killed off the ENTIRE cast without telling us why. This not only ruined the manga for me, because now I know that after some emotional struggles Ikaros will die, but it ruined my overall impression of the anime. I liked the characters. I knew they would probably die, but skipping the final battle, skipping Tomoki&#039;s actions after Ikaros died, skipping Astrea and Nymph&#039;s deaths, skipping Sugata&#039;s injury, skipping EVERY MAJOR PLOT POINT in a movie and expecting it to turn out good is simply unacceptable. <br />
<br />
A big, big disappointment overall.

    There&#039;s nothing to pout about the movie went. All it did was put the most vague  yet the most obvious answer to the SnO series. With a conclusion included on the synopsis, I decided to see this 2nd movie since the 1st movie somewhat pulled me into it.<br />
<br />
I can tell that this SnO movie tried more than it can offer. The story tried to put all things at random, with the usual antics of the gang plus inserted serious footage, I can&#039;t even switch my senses as I just left the movie seen only by my eye and not through my mind. I didn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review163327">
        even bother to understand what it is trying to send to the audiences or what is it about. I clearly don&#039;t want to say something rude about the movie since I can vividly remember the fact that I enjoyed SnO TV series way back some years ago. It&#039;s a terrible experience to see something you like, massacred in a bland fashion and that&#039;s how I can put how this 2nd movie went.<br />
<br />
I could say nothing to the art and sound. It was the usual quality. The feeling of the TV series was retained and Sorami City was still shown as a free and lax city with UMA a.k.a Angeloids roaming around. The ED theme was somewhat closely derived from the movie content itself and it was satisfying to hear at most.<br />
<br />
Characters, are all right, I guess? They&#039;re the same rowdy group that put antics over the much more important details. However, in this movie, the story focuses much more on Tomoki&#039;s and Ikaros&#039; struggle to realize their affection with each other under the over-the-limit denseness.<br />
<br />
I am not a reader of the reference so I definitely don&#039;t have an idea as to how it went, or what should it really be, but if this is an honest adaptation then it&#039;s all more the worth the time missing it.<br />
<br />
Concluding, SnO Final: Eternal My Master is a bad experience and is a hurtful reminder of what a show SnO is all about. I was honestly drawn by SnO due to Tomoki&#039;s perversion and along the way, I couldn&#039;t even realized that SnO is something serious over gag. And giving a conclusion where love prevails is something this show should have left untouched.

    It is my subjective view of this anime...so provokes are not welcomed..<br />
<br />
Before I mention about this movie, There are a few things I want to say.<br />
<br />
I really really really love this anime. Afrter watching &#039;Sora no Otoshimono&#039; I cried a lot..The story was touching, the characters were very attractive, and the music(OST, OPs, EDs, etc) was great. At least I thought so.<br />
<br />
After I finished watching the 1st season of the anime, I watched Forte, Tokei-Jikake no Angeloid, and so on..<br />
<br />
And recently I watched the final series of the sora no otoshimono, Sora no otoshimono final eternal my master.<br />
<br />
The most regretful thing was the story..and I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review162891">
        think other fans would feel the same.<br />
According to the PV of this movie, it said that this movie will contain the truth of the original manga, which made me look forward to this and excited..<br />
<br />
But after I finished watching this movie, the questions I had before still wasn&#039;t solved and it only left more. Additionaly, the story was sort of incomplete..which made me anooyed and puzzled at the same time.<br />
<br />
I was shocked as the story unfolded. At first, without any detailed explanation, tomoki and ikaros were going to synapse with some purpose.<br />
And then, ikaros tells tomoki about her past and why she must take tomoki to synapse. Since I alreay watched the original manga, I could understand what they were talking about but to those who haven&#039;t watched the manga, it would be an very unkind beginning.<br />
And then suddenly the scene changes and the time goes backwards...<br />
 I can&#039;t remember more specefic details about the story but the ending was extremely impressive(not for a too good reason) that I will never forget it.<br />
It might be a spoiler to the fans who haven&#039;t watched it yet so I won&#039;t say exactly what happened. But the time goes back to the present and the synapse appears again..<br />
Actually, the ending was disappointing, but not only disappointing, it left a strong aftertaste. Though I couldn&#039;t watch how tomoki recreated the world, and how he took a revenge on Minos, and other various scenes, I still liked it.<br />
I could watch the happy moments of  tomoki&#039;s everyday life and about the ikaros&#039;s expressionless face.<br />
It felt more like an long OVA than a final movie, but I&#039;m still satisfied with it.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the art was pretty nice.<br />
The hair color of many characters changed a lot and was more neat. The line had become a lot thinner and  coloring became much lighter compared to the anime. In my opinion, I sort of liked this but because I knew the reason, I wasn&#039;t so happy about it. I&#039;ll say about this later..<br />
<br />
The biggest difference was the eye. Before the color much thichker and I think the eyebrows were more detailed. But after the inner part of the eye looked more simple as just filling the color with a monotone(In my private opinion).<br />
<br />
About the Sound, It was good and not so good at the same time.<br />
Actually, All of the musics used in this movie weren&#039;t new except the &#039;Always Smiling&#039; and the &#039;ERSE&#039;, and BGM-1,2,3,4.<br />
Many musics were from the OST albums of the first and second season of the anime(Tenshi ga Kureta Gekibanshuu, Heart ga Me wo Samasu Ongakushu, etc)<br />
Since I loved all the musics of soraoto, I was expecting a new album including many new OSTs but I could only get a few more songs..<br />
<br />
The Characters had changed a lot from the first and second season of the anime and the first movie. Especially, Ikaros had changed more than any other characters. She even disobeyed her master tomoki and tried to throw away him(Of course, it wasn&#039;t her fault. That bad bad bad tomoki oredered ikaros to remove her imprinting from tomoki in order to watch ikaros&#039;s smile although that wasn&#039;t the best solution.).<br />
Also there was something interesting about Kazane Hiyori. After she disappeared because of the dimension bomb(?) in the first movie, she said that she had went to many parallel universes but could only find tomoki in this universe. I wasn&#039;t able to understand what exactly she meant..(After all Soraoto isn&#039;t science anime haha)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment...hmm..there were many erotic scenes but since I focused on the main story, it wasn&#039;t that interesting,,but was still fine.<br />
I don&#039;t have much thing to say about this.<br />
<br />
Overall. Yes, there is a reason why this movie was so different and had such an ending.<br />
The Original company which made the first and second season of the anime and the movie tokei jikake no angeloid was &#039;AIC A.S.T.A.&#039;.<br />
But because of the insufficiency of funds for various reasons, the company sort of fails and the staff members of AIC establishes a new anime company called &#039;Production IMS&#039;.<br />
The reasons why the art style changed and why the story was unkind and incomplete could be partially explained.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading my review..<br />
Since my natvie language is Korean instead of Englinsh, there might be some grammatical errors.<br />
<br />

    So I guess I&#039;ll start this review by saying that this is my first time writing a review so go easy on me.<br />
<br />
I guess a good way to start this off is saying HLP was my first anime and I was really looking forward to the final movie. Least to say, I was disappointed. There was really no explanation for things that needed to be explained and left you with a thought &quot;Well now what?&quot;. Honestly, you&#039;d be better off finishing the manga before watching this movie, it&#039;ll make alot more sense to you.

    OMFG you don&#039;t please just don&#039;t watch this movie!<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re a Sora no Otoshimono fan you&#039;ll be utterly disappointed with this &quot;movie.&quot; It literally provides no ending to the series and doesn&#039;t even make the effort to animate the fights against the Synapse. <br />
<br />
Read the manga! The last 20 chapters of the manga are amazing and that end ohhhhhh that end is so worth it compared to this vomit of story called &quot;Eternal My Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is why I tell everyone if you like a series/show find the true (Canon) source. The manga specially the last chapters were terrific this &quot;movie&quot; is the complete opposite!

    Heaven&#039;s lost property has been a rather interesting anime for me to watch as a whole.  It was a show that I hated, due to its overuse of its ecchi elements, but was a show I really liked because of how much depth and actual plot and story that the show had, which made it stand out from other harem shows that exist.  And so, for the conclusion of the anime adaptation of a rather decently made show, we have this...steaming pile...  (aka Sora no Otoshimono Final:  Eternal my Master.)<br />
<br />
Story (3.40/10):  The story of this so-called &quot;movie&quot; goes with...well, I&#039;m

          <span style="display: none;" id="review168069">
        honestly not sure.  According to the description, it&#039;s supposed to be the &quot;final&quot; movie to wrap up the Sora no Otoshimono anime.  This statement is completely and utterly false.  Cause really, all you get in this movie is essentially a plot about Ikaros, and a bunch of plot holes.<br />
<br />
For the plot involving Ikaros, which was essentially the main part of the movie, we get a new bit of depth to her character as she gets freed by Tomoki, removing her link to him, and thus becoming free like her sisters Nymph and Aestrea.  This part of the movie gave a lot of depth to Ikaros&#039;s character which made her a bit more of a three dimensional character rather than just &quot;another harem girl&quot;.  While this was a well made part of the movie, everything else was rather...lackluster.<br />
<br />
For one thing, at the beginning of the movie, we get a sort of &quot;ending&quot; where we are shown a scene of what seems to be the climax of the movie, before we&#039;re abruptly put into a completely different situation with Tomoki and the Angeloids at home which feels like a very awkward transition because not only the beginning does this, but the entire movie does.  The movie itself consists of many, many transitions to different scenes that change both the characters involved, and the mood and tone of the show.  As a viewer, this is a very awkward experience as the movie never stays consistent with what it wants to do, ending with mostly confusion rather than a synergistic plot.  <br />
<br />
In addition, the whole of the movie skips a lot of details.  (Similar to how TWGOK goddess arc skipped over two of the more important arcs in the series.)  The viewer is basically thrown into a storyline that unless you&#039;ve read the manga, is unfamiliar, even if you&#039;ve seen both seasons and the movie before this one.<br />
<br />
And now, for the nail in the coffin, the one thing that makes this movie deserve a 3 rating for story, the ending.  For one thing, the story ends in a cliffhanger; the one taboo that every production studio should know by now upsets the audience because of how unsatisfying it is.  Not only does it end on a cliffhanger, it ends on a note that leaves a lot to be explained seeing as how the event that the movie ends with is such a shocking event that it created a sense of rage within me because I expected a lot from this movie, seeing as how the anime built up the story and characters rather well.  And seeing the whole thing end with something of this poor quality...it&#039;s a little heartbreaking.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  Good character development for Ikaros<br />
-   Awful scene transitions<br />
- -  Worst...ending...ever.  (Yes, that is two negatives.  Does not equal a positive.)<br />
<br />
Characters (7.22/10):  The characters of the Sora no Otoshimono stay for the most part, same for the movie as they did for the anime.  For the most part, aside from the main two characters of Ikaros and Tomoki, there isn&#039;t very much change to their characters.<br />
<br />
Ikaros mostly gets the development for this movie.  And for her development, we get a better look to her character and her connection with Tomoki.  What I like about this development is how we get to see and explore more of Ikaros as she realizes more of herself over the course of the movie.  And what really makes her character is one simple thing, emotions.  (If you know Ikaros&#039;s character, than you would understand how much of a change that will make.)<br />
<br />
There were however some members of the cast that I felt were some very strange additions.  That being the two angeloids of Chaos and Zeta (Hiyori).  While Chaos was a decent addition considering how her arc in the end of the second season would match up to her appearance in the movie.  <br />
<br />
Hiyori however is a different story.  Hiyori is the angeloid that appeared in the first Sora no Otoshimono movie.  And because of her appearance in the last movie and what had happened to her, her appearance in this movie was rather surprising.  (So surprising that I actually had to pause the film and think for five minutes as to WHY she would even be here.)  Her very appearance in the film is evidence enough to show that the movie skipped over a LOT of detail from the last movie which shows how bad the creators screwed up with the passage of time from this film and the last.  They even bothered us to show us some scenes involving events with the other characters that apparently we were supposed to know.  (Cause I don&#039;t remember one of characters getting stabbed in any part of the anime.)<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  Consistent main characters<br />
+  Great character development for Ikaros<br />
-  Confusing character addition.  (Hiyori)<br />
<br />
Art and Sound (7.56/10 and 7.00/10):  The art for Sora no Otoshimono has always been one of its strong points because of how distinct it is.  The show switches its normal style of animation with a chibi style of animation, interchanging between the two during comedy moments, and even making them exist in the same scene.  It&#039;s a very distinct style that fits very well for the show, considering how detailed the standard style looks and how well integrated the two styles go with each other.  <br />
<br />
As for music, the sound for this movie seems to be as good quality as what the anime openings and endings had.  While it wasn&#039;t as prominent, the sound was still rather nice, though I would admit it&#039;s not as memorable as it could be.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  Good and distinct visual style<br />
+  Good integration between both animation styles<br />
+/-  Decent sound<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment (2.33/10):  To be honest, I hate this movie.  I&#039;ve always been impartial with the Sora no Otoshimono series because it has 1 part of it that I love, and another part that I hate.  That being the actual story and the ecchi.  The plot I felt has always been a strong point in the series as it gives a nice bit of mystery and has always kept me interested.  However, as an inverse, I&#039;ve always felt that the ecchi part of the show was a bit distracting and a bit out of place because it was always done in an extreme, an extreme that I personally don&#039;t like.  Well, enough of my opinion on the series.  Time for my opinion on the movie.<br />
<br />
For one thing, this shouldn&#039;t even be called a movie.  It barely breaks an hour of runtime, it&#039;s basically as long as GJ-bu&#039;s OVA which has a runtime of 45 minutes.  (A movie is generally at the very least 1.5 hours.  Even anime movies.)  Another thing is the fact that this movie basically downgrades the quality of this series because despite its overactive ecchi portions, Sora no Otoshimono is still a good series.  I just felt a bit disappointed when watching this because I expected a lot of things, good things since this movie was supposed to wrap up the series as a whole which it failed to do because it left out so many details and explanations, turning it into a mass of plot holes and confusion than anything else.  <br />
<br />
In addition, this was originally supposed to be the third season of the anime, existing in a 12-13 episode long season.  Why they made the change, I&#039;m not sure, (probably budget cuts or something), but really, I was disappointed because story-wise, the plot would&#039;ve been much better and better explained seeing as how a 49 minute movie compared to a 12 episode long season of 24 minutes is quite a gap for screentime.  Personally, I would&#039;ve liked to see a third season.  Hell, I would watch a loop of Tomoki&#039;s nipple song for 10 hours in order to get a third season.  (That&#039;s a figure of speech.  No one take that too literally, k?)  Alright then, 3 question time.<br />
<br />
Did I like this movie?<br />
<br />
Well...kinda.  The movie did some good things by giving Ikaros more character development and more qualities to her character, which is always welcome in any anime series since character development is what makes us the audience relate to the character and attach ourselves to them as they go about the story plot.<br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I like?<br />
<br />
Plot holes, cliffhanger read the manga ending, awkward transisitons, uncomfortable ecchi moments; need I say more?<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this to anyone?<br />
<br />
If you&#039;ve watched both anime series Sora no Otoshimono and Sora no Otoshimono: Forte in addition to the movie Sora no Otoshimono tokeijikake no angeloid, well, you gotta finish the whole thing, right?  Well, not really.  This movie to me is sort of like Madoka Magica rebellion in a sense of how you personally would want the series to end.  (I&#039;m personally sticking with the anime ending in that discussion.)  You can either stay with the anime&#039;s ending and keep that in mind as the &quot;ending&quot; of the series, or you can watch this and &quot;accept&quot; this as the true ending of the series.  Really though, I would say not to as the anime already diverges from the original source material, and the endings for the anime and even the first movie are far better than the one that this one provides.  In short, Sora no Otoshimono Final: Eternal my Master is by far the worst alliteration in this franchise.  It&#039;s clunky, poorly written, and very, very confusing.  Personally, I would not recommend it, as I find it to be a very poor viewing experience.<br />

    &quot;Awful&quot; &quot;confusing&quot; &quot;major let down&quot; &quot;WISH I NEVER WATCHED IT!&quot;<br />
<br />
The series Sora no Otoshimono i recommend it&#039;s great in all perspectives and i enjoyed it it&#039;s just this movies is a major let down.<br />
<br />
I found this movie to be extremely horrible due to its huge gaps in information and the story is all over the place. The movie starts with an intense scene that leaves you wonder how it got to be that way. When it cuts back in time it does so to show a meaningless heap of sh!t before returning to the climax with no explanation what so ever. <br />
<br />
PEOPLE SHOULDN&#039;T DIE WITH

    This movie honestly did no justice for the epic conclusion of this series. Rather than actually care about their fans, and going out with style, instead, this was cobbled together. The movie did the ending manga NO justice at all. It was confusing as all heck, and just blatantly made me think that in the end, it was truly over. I was so sad after the ending of the movie. So I went and read the manga, and it turns out, the creators really had skimped on detail. 50 minutes for something that could easily be an entire season? That is huge bogus on their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180037">
        part. I loved this series, and this ending really put a dampener on it as a whole. Shame on these creators. Why would they do this after creating such a good story? The plot was heartwarming, the character development, stellar! And then this happened. All in all, a sour ending for a sweet story. Hint of advice. Read the manga, THEN watch the movie, otherwise it&#039;s confusing.

    Hi their everyone here&#039;s my review of Heaven&#039;s Lost Property Final: My Eternal Master. Before you watch this movie I suggest watching the rest of the series and reading the manga( I haven&#039;t but I could tell I wasn&#039;t aware of some things) .<br />
<br />
Story: It starts out with Icarus and Tomoki flying towards the Synapse and so many questions in the audiences mind. The story then processeds to jump into a flash back that will be the telling of the main story for the movie. From here the viewers are dropped into the world of HLP sometime after Forte and Movie 1 took place. From

          <span style="display: none;" id="review159679">
        here Tomoki and the gang proceed on what could be described as a long episode of the series in which Tomoki and Icarus come to realize their feelings for each other. In the end it is enjoyable but it feels very rushed in trying to wrap up the story that was supposed to have a 3rd season. Because of this 3/10.<br />
<br />
Art 10/10 Improved from the series looks amazing. That&#039;s what a movie budget lets you do I guess.<br />
<br />
Sound 10/10 Songs from the show return, acting was good. I can only assume the dub will have the return of the cast which will be great as well.<br />
<br />
Characters 6/10 Everyone is the same as they were in the show following their typical character traits without much time to improve themselves besides Tomo and Icarus which is fine since the movie is centered around those 2. However they drop 2 characters that briefly appear in the anime/movie into the mix and are just like oh you&#039;re here and now part of our group. I&#039;m sure manga readers will make more sense of this but to anime only viewers I just really have to wonder why they&#039;re back.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I rated it a 7 on mal so I stand by that. As a stand alone story it was good but as an ending to the whole series of HLP I&#039;m disappointed.<br />
<br />
Overall I&#039;m giving this a 7. Besides the overall story basically ending out of nowhere this is enjoyable for fans of the series. And if you really want to know more about what ends up happening in HLP you&#039;ll read the manga. It shouldn&#039;t have to be that way but that&#039;s what happens when a season of anime gets crammed into a 50 minute movie :/<br />
<br />
Hope you enjoyed the review everyone.

    I feel like they rushed it. After watching this I felt a little down... but after awhile - after thinking my head through - I figured out the plot. I saw what they left out, and for my enjoyment, after reading the last pieces of manga, I noticed that I had been right! The story is amazing! It truly is. But this last movie was not. It cut out too much of important stuff and I feel like the creators didn&#039;t really care. They rushed this just so the anime could have a conclusion and so they cut out the most important stuff (which can

          <span style="display: none;" id="review168995">
        be figured out or at least guessed if you pay attention during the films as I did).  I am the kinda guy who likes to see the happy ending with no space for the viewers interpretation (in some cases). This could have been one. But yet again, as this last movie was what it was, it didn&#039;t do honor for the manga - so people, if after watching this amazing anime, and then when the credits of SnO Final Eternal My Master start to roll and you feel disappointed / confused, here&#039;s my advice: read the manga (at least the ending) so you really see how the things ended and what really happened!

    &quot;What the fuck did i just fucking watch?&quot; This is the question that will appear on your head when you have finished this movie!. There are people who read manga or anime, Of course people who watch both. Having said that, This movie has totally stabbed the fans of &quot;Heaven&#039;s Lost Property&quot; with the &quot;Empire State Building&quot;, No exaggeration. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m a huge fan of the series, I had high hopes for this film and i feel betrayed. Right on the start. The World is disintegrating and you&#039;re like, What the hell is going on? Tomoki and Ikarus appear to be the only ones left there,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review165081">
        They&#039;re talking about &quot;Zeus&quot; and i also was like what&#039;s that, Tomoki asks Ikarus to take him to the synapse and she does and also reveals that she would die if so and goes regardless. At this point you&#039;re like? Any time now? I want to know what&#039;s going on?. <br />
<br />
So the story starts and i had a good laughs but as the time transpired i was sweating cold and being like Ok, Where the hell is my explanation? The movie reaches the end back to the beginning and Ikarus dies and launches tomoki into the synapse, Right before saying &quot; I love you my master&quot; and The end.<br />
<br />
What the fuck is that? What in the multiple world of fuck was that? That&#039;s what i want to know. For any fan that hasn&#039;t watched &quot;Heaven&#039;s Lost Property: Eternal My Master&quot; DON&#039;T WATCH IT. It will taint your current regard of the series, I&#039;m having nightmares on this. <br />
<br />
Sohara, Mikado, Astrea, Chaos, Nymph, Hiyori all wipe out of existence and you will not know where are they at? what happened? At all!  I repeat.<br />
<br />
This movie has good comedy, good drama, But the movie is about &quot;What the hell is going on&quot; and what you really see is &quot;Shuffled memories of Ikarus and Tomoki plus a love confession and a kiss&quot; and The END.  I&#039;m so mad, I am now wishing to have stopped my self from watching this film. The memories and the countless times i&#039;ve watched the series have been crapped on and stabbed multiple times, Please don&#039;t do this to your self, I wish someone had told me not to watch it, Now what do i do with the anime i currently own plus the first movie.

    As a fan of sora no otoshimono&#039;s anime but also seeing all other reviews of how terrible this movie is, I watched it with a grain of salt. The whole experience was an obligation for closure rather than enjoyment.<br />
This movie contains no structure or coherency, and it felt more like a youtube compilation of funny moments with some more serious moments sprinkled in. Which you should ignore completely if you wish to enjoy it because there is no resolution or development for them. The only thing that had some resolve was the romance between Tomoki and Ikaros, but it&#039;s hardly anything emotionally deep. I also

          <span style="display: none;" id="review174645">
        struggled to understand the logic behind their emotions and actions. <br />
At the end of the day, this movie is more or less a advertisement or trailer for what&#039;s to come in the manga. So watch it if you want that completion but otherwise it&#039;s not worth your time.

<br />
This is my very first review on MAL, but I have been a loyal watcher and reader of Sora no Otoshimono and was fairly disappointed with the &quot;Finale&quot; (If I should even call it that).<br />
<br />
For those who have seen the first two seasons of Sora no Otoshimono, we all knew that the anime adaptation was going to be fairly different from it&#039;s manga counterpart. Many people have come to terms that a book will always be better than its media production, and to me SnO was fairly even with the story in the anime and the story in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review163597">
        the manga... that is until I watched Sora no Otoshimono Final: Eternal my Master.<br />
<br />
Characters 10/10:<br />
Let&#039;s start with one of the most enjoyable parts of the anime: the characters. For those who have been loyal fans of Sora no Otoshimono since Episode/Chapter 1, Volume 1, the characters have not changed (however they have developed quite excellently, through the good effort of Suu Minazuki). However, Hiyori is brought back into the series, something that was teased in the first movie&#039;s ending scene. Chaos is also shown with a little more depth, but didn&#039;t receive any development. Overall, the characters were their old, funny selves but gave off a darker vibe than it&#039;s premovie counterparts (mostly due to the movie being about 50 minutes long).<br />
<br />
Art 10/10:<br />
I have nothing to say other than Suu Minazuki was a genius in designing these characters. I like to think of it on par or even better than the animations than Date a Live and Noucome, considering those were later releases the animation was amazing.<br />
<br />
Sound 10/10:<br />
The sound itself had no problems, other than there just needed to be more of it. I found that some scenes could have used more music to it while others could have used a different sound track. Like I said, no problems with the sound.<br />
<br />
Story 4/10:<br />
This is where the movie failed. <br />
For those who have read the manga of SnO, we all know the emotional impact it had on us. The build to the climax (AND THAT LONG AWAITED PUNCH TO THE FACE) had left the story with a sad but sweet taste to it, sad because the series is over but sweet since the ending was just beautiful. The faults of this movie lies with its pacing. <br />
<br />
1) The movie left out much of the manga. It completely skipped over some of the huge highlights of the manga (Pandora evo, Chaos development, Suguha&#039;s past). While the parts that were adapted were good, they were rushed, and some parts were cut and fused with other parts of the story. Having a season 3 rather than movie would&#039;ve fixed this problem immediately, and would&#039;ve probably risen sales, but to me it doesn&#039;t look like the sales will be very high.<br />
<br />
2) Can you even consider that an ending? It gave you a taste of the manga, something I had fangirl screamed over for the first five minutes until the next 40 minutes ruined it, with the last 5 minutes leaving me feeling frustrated, annoyed, and most of all unsatisfied. The original manga ending was beautiful and, IN MY OPINION (yes people share different opinions), perfect for the story. Now all Nippon and IMS had to do was copy that same ending and it&#039;s emotional impact and boom, the score average would&#039;ve probably risen to about an 8, but because it didn&#039;t the story gets a 4. Don&#039;t title something as a finale when it doesn&#039;t even end anything.<br />
<br />
*Enjoyment 5~/10:<br />
Regardless of how bad the movie was executed, I love Sora no Otoshimono from the bottom of my heart. This rating is starred because it is my OWN PERSONAL rating, so it will be heavily biased. Sora no Otoshimono is absolutely amazing as a whole, but this movie gave me s**t. That &quot;Read the Manga Ending&quot; completely pissed me off, and I can imagine Suu Minazuki facepalming right now over the poor execution of this movie. I would be facepalming too if I knew that 3-5 entire parts of my story that were important, intense, and amazing were cut out and filled in with a crappy 50 minute movie that didn&#039;t even solve anything.<br />
<br />
Overall 4/10:<br />
The story is mainly what ruined it for me. I want to completely forget this movie ever existed and just reread the manga, because the manga has all the good stuff and none of the bad stuff Nippon and IMS gave me. My recommendation is to just pick up Sora no Otoshimono from where it left off in Season 2 and read it from there &#039;til the end. You&#039;ll find it more complete and more enjoyable than this movie.
