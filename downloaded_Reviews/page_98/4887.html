    How unoriginal can a movie be before it’s too much? At what point does it become just lazy writing? Black Fox is here to quench your thirst for an answer. I wouldn’t be surprised if they wrote down some cliche movie tropes and used that for the story. For what it showed me is that the staff had no inspiration for what it was going to be.<br />
<br />
It becomes very apparent from the premise alone how little effort was put into this. The family of Rikka Isurugi are assassinated by a super evil corporation that does super evil things. She then plans her revenge by becoming

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319093">
        a superhero who fights for justice! One of the most standard motives they could’ve gone with. This is far from the only trope they use. Take a sip each time you see a movie trope and you will go haywire likely within the first half. It’s a by the book story that’s been done plenty of time before and better.   <br />
<br />
Same can be said about the characters who all fit into your typical archetypes. That’s not in and of itself something that ruins the movie. But it’s short length hindered them from becoming the multilayered characters they needed to be. For that reason it’s hard to be invested in them. Rikka has at least understandable motivations, and the first act does a decent job at giving us a reason to care about it albeit on a very surface level. However the revenge story collides with a different one. Another girl archetype appears and the story shifts more focus on her. With the movie instead ending with her story&#039;s conclusion rather than Rikka’s. She doesn’t get her revenge on the people who killed her family, at least not the ones mainly responsible. The main villain was a generic mad scientist working for them.<br />
<br />
The story was a severe letdown and the characters were not much better. But there was at least some effort put into the visuals. The character designs didn’t impress me much, and the backgrounds while decent were nothing extraordinary to look at. However, animation-wise it was very fluid and stylized in it’s fight scenes. Making for some solid eye candy. The budget constraints shines through at times and the CGI was taken right out of a PlayStation 2 game which didn’t blend well with it’s 2D counterpart.<br />
<br />
The music is solid but like most things in this movie feels very uninspired and didn&#039;t leave any impressions. It is fittingly used for the emotions the scenes it&#039;s used in is trying to convey while not becoming distracting, but didn&#039;t add anything unique or memorable to the movie. With other words it’s as standard as you get.<br />
<br />
The fact that the movie was so short didn&#039;t make it too unbearable but there is so much more you can use 90 minutes on that&#039;s not this. I would only recommend it if you want some good sakuga or have seen very few movies in your lifetime. For everyone else, go watch some paint dry. You will probably find more entertainment that way.

    First off i would like to say that this movie feels like a really long introduction to a anime series which isnt a bad thing <br />
<br />
It starts off fleshing out the plot which is very movie like but it sets things up in a grander theme later<br />
<br />
As for what i thought off the movie, its great but very forgettable. The characters, sound and art are all great but its missing a wow factor.<br />
<br />
The plot moves pretty fast near the end and its a little cliche how its focussed on revenge <br />
<br />
Overall the movie was pretty good but forgettable <br />
<br />
would rate a 7.5 but that isnt

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319084">
        possible so i gave it an 8 because of the character design

    Story: 6<br />
It&#039;s straightforward, you don&#039;t really have to think to get into it. You do find that this idea is plagued with clichés that do not allow it to see its full potential.<br />
Art: 7<br />
The quality is varies throughout the film. I wouldn&#039;t say it hinders the enjoyment. Fight scenes become somewhat blurry and uneasy to follow at times. <br />
Sound: 6<br />
Nothing special. Music and sound both add to the experience. It does not feel like it is something that really come out on top compared to other movies.<br />
Character: 6<br />
For a movie, this is something that could have been done better. This is mainly because of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319120">
        choices were made to introduce and develop each character. It seems as if it is unorganized, as it is confusing to understand the movie at times.<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
Scenes build up into the next, building towards the climax. Story and Art do not hinder enjoyment, as it contains quite exciting fight scenes that are somewhat well thought out.<br />
Overall: 7<br />
Many of the choices are questionable, but it does not stop it from becoming a movie that can have its moments. This movie could have improved with better direction and storytelling.

    In many ways BlackFox reminds me of Princess Principal. Its premise made it seem like a full one-shot story but instead ends up being some superhero origin story down the line. There are fun and interesting bits here and there, but nothing seems to be developed to its full potential, leaving much to be desired even as the end credits roll. By far the worst offender is the cliffhanger ending, which, as of this writing, has no confirmed continuation. <br />
<br />
Still, the movie is fine. My personal favourite bit is the last act where it turns into Symphogear (complete with hot blooded punching and villainous fakeouts),

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319129">
        but as it stands, plotwise, BlackFox is just okay. <br />
<br />
I wouldn&#039;t mind seeing episodic adventures if this ever gets turned into a TV Series, but my delusions of this being a serious/semi-serious plot-driven adventure type show has been shattered completely. <br />
<br />
5/10

    Honestly Its got all the typical shounen ticks but it is very enjoyable <br />
<br />
You can literally see this was meant to be a full TV show anime, some points it does feel fast paced you do not get a chance to get to know the characters.<br />
<br />
But in terms of artwork it was very clean and high production value i really liked that, the fight scenes really well done.<br />
<br />
one thing i also liked the character interaction between rikka and her friends (yeah they say so ). <br />
<br />
the OST also is really good <br />
<br />
overall it is very decent and watchable but forgettable

    When the final shot of the trailer is also the final shot of the movie, something has gone seriously wrong.<br />
<br />
Original projects are usually a lot more interesting and creative than established franchises, but there is a caveat that when one falters, it brings far more down than an adaptation would.<br />
<br />
Black Fox is a movie that feels like a draft screenplay of itself. The main plot and central characters have been planned out, and in a vacuum are decent, but everything else feels completely rushed. Be it up to me, I&#039;d have asked for the whole movie to be given a serious once-over before release, lest

          <span style="display: none;" id="review347596">
        it end up as mundane as it actually did.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
The plot is two entwined; the first being a revenge story, and the second a superhero origin. These work together, and I&#039;d argue are pulled off very well. Unfortunately, the movie stuck very close to its own tropes, to the degree that the story becomes consistently predictable. My only real complaint is a revelation during the epilogue that doesn&#039;t do anything for the story and was not foreshadowed at all save for a single, potentially missable background detail. This revelation did not add anything to the story, and under examination actually detracts from it.<br />
<br />
All promotional material suggested three protagonists, Rikka, Mia and Melissa. Rikka is the main driving force, Mia is a foe turned ally, and Melissa the one who instigates this change. Rikka and Mia are reasonably good characters, with simple and somewhat parallel arcs, but just like the plot, have predictable conclusions, even though the portrayal is decent. Melissa, however, feels incomplete. Allying Mia is the only plot relevance she has, and her own character has no depth other than being an archetypal friend. She does come into play during the epilogue, but as stated it affects the story negatively.<br />
<br />
The movie&#039;s two villains are another weak point. One is basically pulled out of events after the first act, and the other, the eventual final opponent of the movie, is a stock mad scientist. He doesn&#039;t quite have enough flair to be an exceptional one, but has pretty good moments, especially right before the final act. The first, though, never gets an opportunity to do anything other than grimace, leaving me apathetic.<br />
<br />
Finally, there are Rikka&#039;s robot animals. Frankly, they&#039;re little more than macguffins with voices, and I&#039;m still left amiss as to whether they had any more significance that I couldn&#039;t decipher. They do very little to actually further the plot, other than the bird flying Rikka away once or twice. For being breakthrough technology, they&#039;re not too impressive.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Every technical aspect is roughly average, including art, sound effects, animation, direction and editing. The most worthwhile thing is the theme song, which is excellent and what originally made me watch the movie. There is somewhat bad CGI integration, but this isn&#039;t something I personally have a problem with.<br />
<br />
As for style, while the art isn&#039;t really unique, there are some designs i liked, such as Mia&#039;s original and Rikka&#039;s final combat outfits. The overall setting had some ideas behind it, I think with the combination of modern and historic elements, but there wasn&#039;t anything that really came of this. The tone was alright, but nothing that felt really significant. Some of the apparati where kinda neat, like Rikka&#039;s colour-changing jacket or ninja equipment, but that&#039;s icing rather than stylistic in my opinion.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
In order to improve Black Fox, I would firstly cut the epilogue&#039;s reveal entirely, as it does taint the story a little. I think that Melissa and the animals should be reintegrated to be a lot more important, and with both put more emphasis on their relationships with Rikka, so that they have emotional significant to the protagonist rather than just being furnishing elements. The villains, particularly the original, could get a bit more depth and motivations, since they also felt sidelined by the script.<br />
<br />
Overall, Black Fox was an acceptable premise but wasn&#039;t made as exciting as it could have been. With every good detail was a bad, leaving the movie essentially average. However, it does at least have the minimum of my attention, and if a sequel does come out, all of my complaints could feasibly be rectified within it, so I&#039;d most likely still be interested.

    This movie wasn&#039;t made for us. No, I don&#039;t mean this movie wasn&#039;t made for me. No, I don&#039;t mean this movie wasn&#039;t made specifically for you. What I mean is that the people that are likely to watch this movie and find information about it through this site, are not the people likely to enjoy this movie. Black Fox is a superhero origin story, about a girl that has been trained to be a ninja and has access to a lot of technological gadgets, whose appeal as a person is her kind nature. A budget teenage girl Batman if you will. I do think

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319768">
        that the movie did accomplish to imitate the exact same process other western movies have used, but not actually succeed in what those movies had<br />
<br />
Now let me ask, have you ever seen a movie about a superhero origin story, that has had huge success in the western media? Your answer, if yes, is probably: yeah, I watched [insert random Marvel movie]. Well, this movie is a japanese attempt to cash in on that marketing strategy, by making a movie that employs the exact same style and structure. Given what I said, you probably know what to expect already if you were familiar with those, but even then, you might still be like: &quot;Yeah, but it is Japan, this movie is still going to be anime as fuck, right?&quot; Actually, that&#039;s what I would have expected too, but the answer is actually no. The only thing that is particularly anime about this, is that they are girls of high school age doing things they should not be physically capable. There&#039;s one part in the climax of the final fight that you might assume is anime as fuck, but honestly, that actually is how most final fights in Marvel movies are resolved too, so at best I&#039;d call it overlap. It is genuinely faithful to that formula, and I&#039;m sure it is just an attempt to see if it has any success outside the west, or it could be that someone enjoyed that formula so much they just wanted to test it out.<br />
<br />
Now for those of you unfamiliar and not knowing what to expect, superhero origin stories are so frequent that they pretty much have a template they always follow. And Black Fox is no exception to this. They are often very predictable, and the template itself is not actually what sells the movie, it&#039;s just a tool to make the movie be sufficiently competent and present the character to both an audience that is familiar with them and one that is unfamiliar with them at the same time. If you go watch a superhero movie, you often already know entirely what it is about, since you are familiar with DC and Marvel. Black Fox however is something entirely unfamiliar to the audience, and the only way it relates to the viewer is whether or not they are aware of such content. It uses the structure and techniques of such movies but do they actually work in its favor?<br />
<br />
My answer is that the only way it would work is if you were unfamiliar with that structure. The way Black Fox is structured imitates pretty much every movie of its type I am familiar with, to the point I could predict every single story beat as soon as it was set up. So, if familiar with these types of movies, you will see absolutely nothing new. It has no degree of subtlety and it continuously moves forward, by first presenting a setup (which can be as small as a tease) and next presenting its payoff. The thing is that makes the movie even more predictable since every single story beat presented on screen, is either there to set up something later down the line, be it a twist or to raise the impact a scene will have, 5 minutes later. It feels like every single thing presented is not presented to tell a story but rather to serve the structure used in the prior movies, like a template for success. The structure for such movies doesn’t simply work because the structure itself is a failsafe way to present a superhero origin, but rather they are a template to adapt one superhero origin people already have knowledge of and interest in.<br />
<br />
To an audience that is unfamiliar with said structure, they may have some success but their actual reasons they sell in the western media are: brand recognition, (since it is something people are familiar with, the movie will pull its already existing fanbase, as well as their friends that are not familiar with that character) acting, (actors are capable of breathing even further life into the characters, and making them even more appealing based on their performance) solid source material, (in most cases, the template can work because the character has an already defined identity that is appealing to its audience, and they don&#039;t have to put much thought into presenting the story since the source material has already done so, and the story will already have plenty of bones and meat, allegedly) and accessibility. (comic books are not the most accessible media to consume, as most of the hero origins were released prior to content being digitized, and as a result they often end up rereleased with some modifications or redone from zero, to familiarize the audience. Movies are more accessible to a wider audience and they are easier to preserve and spread, since their content is digital, not physical. So, if anyone was genuinely interested in the concept of the comics, but they didn&#039;t have accessibility to the source material, now they have an easier way to access the content)<br />
<br />
Black Fox has no brand recognition or source material, it is an original concept after all, it doesn&#039;t rely on acting, since its visual are carried across through animation and voice acting doesn&#039;t require the voice actor to project as much personality as a normal actor. They definitely do and can even do it better than the visuals in some cases, don&#039;t get me wrong, but they are not entirely relied on for that purpose usually, which is no exception here. But well, it might have plenty of accessibility and novelty to a japanese audience. That&#039;s why I said this movie was not made for us. We are likely going to have plenty of familiarity, be it direct or indirect, with pretty much everything Black Fox attempts to achieve as a movie and as a story. But since it is a superhero origin story in its most basic form, it might have success in japan, presenting more westernized story structures and concepts and see if they appeal to their audience, to people that wouldn&#039;t otherwise engage with them, in the medium they are familiar with. <br />
<br />
As a result, I do think Black Fox is a test, to see if this story structure can be successful to a japanese audience. The movie pretty much put its entire focus on following this standard structure (beware that this might spoil you, there&#039;s no concrete plot details, just the average structure of such movies): Present the hero&#039;s life prior to starting their journey (in order to show who they are and how they are different from the average person) -&gt; Define their motivations and future goal (Happens through one of the following three: a tragic event that redefines their life, a mission that is given to them because they are the only one who can accomplish it or an accidental event that grants them the ability to do exactly what they always wished for. In some cases, there is a certain degree of overlap and it is going to be a combination of those. If you read the series&#039; synopsis you already know which of these it is. ) -&gt; Have them prepare for their journey (This is either done through them training, or them undertaking their journey while not entirely prepared, with their actions acting as an experience that will prepare them for the future) -&gt; Have them engage the antagonist but not be able to win straight up (This is to create tension and present in what ways the antagonist is a foil to them) -&gt; Give them a moment of respite to reflect on their loss (used to reflect on what differentiates them from the antagonist and some self-reflection for their character arc) -&gt; Reignite the conflict with even bigger stakes -&gt; Have the character complete their character arc and learning from their past mistakes, helping them resolve the conflict -&gt; Conclude with the foil being rejected and the hero identity finally being assumed -&gt; Tease the sequel.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem with Black Fox for someone familiar with the structure, is that it feels exactly like this:<br />
<br />
Japan: Can I copy your homework?<br />
America: Yes, just change it up a bit so it doesn&#039;t look obvious that it was copied.<br />
Japan: Black Fox<br />
<br />
Japan managed to copy the homework correctly, on a subject they don&#039;t really have a solid grasp of. As a result, its hero, doesn&#039;t feel heroic or like a genuinely good person. There&#039;s not really any point where the heroine here acts either heroically or outside their own self-interest. It hardly feels like someone conquering their demons to do good in the world, but more like a character wanting to do what is their self-interest, but what&#039;s morally good denying them of their desire, and them having to adjust. The main character is supposed to have as her appeal in her kindness, but they are not kind, they are just a brat. She&#039;s neither a compassionate or good person and she has operated entirely in their own self-interest the entire time. She hasn&#039;t done anything outright good, just things that aren&#039;t morally reprehensible, yet the story does praise them for their kindness. She can also appear quite weak-willed at times, since she sometimes does not fully pursue their goal or respects what she says and due to that appears undecisive. Truth be told, the qualities that would make her a hero are absent, but I guess that is somewhat acceptable, since she hasn&#039;t really been acknowledged as such. The only reason I take issue with these traits, is because the movie acts as if they are her virtues, but they are at best traits that are currently a work in progress and at worst non-existent.<br />
<br />
The movie has every single thing executed correctly, it has the structure, the beats, the concept, the visuals, perhaps even the audience. But it lacks the substance. The appeal that has made the stories that were adapted attract the interest of various people around the world. It may have some passion and enjoyment of everything that has been made with this structure, but it is not its own thing. <br />
<br />
As a result, I find it hard to recommend to someone familiar with this type of movie, since there is absolutely nothing new for you to see, and I also have a hard time to recommend it to someone unfamiliar, since there are so many better alternatives that use the very same structure and also present a character that has both charisma and is very admirable. Black Fox doesn&#039;t manage to capitalize on any of the qualities using the structure it has appealing, but it is an interesting enough experiment to watch. I&#039;d recommend showing this show to an unsuspecting audience unfamiliar with this style of movie, if it&#039;s more accessible to them than a western superhero movie, and to gauge their reaction. Because that&#039;s who this movie was made for. And if continuously invested in, the success of the western superhero blockbusters can be replicated in anime form. Even though it might not be an interesting watch, it might the start for the pursuit of an interesting result. So, if you want to watch this movie as an informative way to observe their strategy, I fully support that, because that part of the movie is genuinely interesting, and that&#039;s what made me talk at length about it. I wish it had more substance to discuss the actual things it tried, but the only thing I could observe how hard it tries to imitate what it wishes it would&#039;ve been. And by pursuing every single technical detail about it, it manages to entirely miss the point. That these movies are meant to present the best qualities humanity has to offer and demonstrate them. And that it doesn&#039;t.<br />

    One could probably make a pretty good argument for calling this movie &quot;generic&quot;, and I wouldn&#039;t really be able to fault them for that assessment. But I will also say that for all the minor gripes I had while watching, there was not a moment where I was not entertained.<br />
<br />
The story moved at a nice, brisk pace that didn&#039;t get too far ahead of itself nor lag enough to feel slow; characters were interesting and motivations made sense all around.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack for this film was especially well done, and that&#039;s coming from a guy that doesn&#039;t typically take notice of soundtracks at all. From the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319161">
        first sinister beats in the film to the score for the final action scene, the music really managed to stand out and raise the bar for the whole movie.<br />
<br />
Overall, this was a very pleasant experience and a good way to kill 90 minutes.

    Story, setting &amp; concept:<br />
Concept &amp; setting of this movie are pretty interesting. Modern/futuristic ninja mixed with few other ideas make it really good and rather unique concept, especially how its made. <br />
It also definetly catches your interest as far as story goes and it is good, despite few basic tropes (which never get disturbing due to delivery). Blackfox also manages to pull some great foreshadowing if you pay attention to details.<br />
Main characters also tend to be very interesting.<br />
However, story sadly is its weakpoint as well- while story is very interesting, the movie format means that lot of things probably had to be cut from movie

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319119">
        and it shows as some parts feel bit rushed or even have &quot;wait, how does that even matter&quot; feel to it.<br />
All that said, it definetly feels like a pilot movie for the series, which i sincerely hope is the case as i definetly want to see more of this. Not to mention TV show format would definetly fit it better and would allow writers to explain things that were lacking in here. Story is also the reason i give it <br />
<br />
Art, sound and animation<br />
Blackfox manages to pull off some great animation and art is definetly top tier as well. Soundtrack of Blackfox needs special mention as lot of it really nicely supports what is going on on the screen without overwhelming it. That fully shows how much tought was put into sound design as that is quite difficult to pull off in any medium as even big names in anime dont quite have it down.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
Despite shortcomings caused by format (it would have benefitted much more by TV show format instead of movie), it was extremely enjoyable. And i sincerely hope to see more of this

    The problem with Black Fox is bcause it is an enjoyable well-polished anime that still lacks something. <br />
<br />
The story reminds me of some 90&#039;s OVA&#039;s, but with an updated aesthetic for our times and a softer tone, without all the gratuitous gore. Think about something close to Birdy the Mighty beat. <br />
<br />
The technical aspects of Black Fox are amazing, with gorgeous animation, but it somewhat lack its own style. You know, if Trigger were responsible for the movie, they would have made it unique and would receive critical acclaim. It still have a gorgeous animation, but still kinda generic, without its own identity. <br />
<br />
The characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327329">
        are kinda undeveloped, BUT IT&#039;S A MOVIE AND IT&#039;S OKAY TO NOT HAVE TIME TO DEVELOP MULTILAYERED CHARACTERS BECAUSE IT&#039;S A MOVIE. The thing about it is that this movie is clearly made to be a setup for a proper series and I&#039;m eager to see more of the girls and how their bond can develop with more screen time. <br />
<br />
To be honest, this is a well-intentioned and unpretentious big anime episode. I&#039;ve seen worse, actually bad stuff, being acclaimed for much less. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    a beautiful masterpiece with a lacklustre story and that&#039;s really the only thing holding it back <br />
<br />
art and animation are top notch I don&#039;t know if its true but there seems to be a much more emphasis on hand drawn frames which really show&#039;s in the character expressions and there body movements and the fight scenes are very fast paced like something you would see in Naruto (the hand to hand scenes)and one of my favourite shots was a simple one just being an overhead shot of the dinner table with all the characters avoiding conversation its just something you don&#039;t see in anime a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319850">
        lot is overhead shot&#039;s<br />
<br />
<br />
sound seemed fine I&#039;m not much of a sound guy but the music was good and the voice acting fine<br />
<br />
<br />
character design was fine like I said the expressions and body movement really make them a lot more lively although I wasn&#039;t a fan of the final battle armour it just didn&#039;t look very practical and any anime that doesn&#039;t feel the need to through fan service at you get&#039;s bonus points from me the two main girls are very badass and you just want to see more of them <br />
<br />
<br />
now the biggest issue the plot the plot is very cliché her father dies and she&#039;s out for revenge which isn&#039;t a problem the problem is it play&#039;s it too safe with her not wanting to kill anyone if it went for those darker tones like sword of the stranger or princess principle (I bring up those 2 because that&#039;s what people are comparing it too) it would be much more memorable and also that it&#039;s setting up for a sequel that will probably never happen <br />
another disappointment was the final fight it was good looking there&#039;s just not a lot you can do when you have a ninja vs a psychic <br />
<br />
<br />
overall a good looking movie that leaves a lot too be desired

    Personally  from what I seen from the reviews it not the best movie idea in some eyes, but regardless of that,  I truly enjoy the movie from what the writers have come up with even if to other&quot;s it a copy &amp; paste lol. <br />
<br />
<br />
This site really wants me to go out of my way to write some long ass review 0-0. The voice acting  cast did well in captivating their characters/flushing out how they felt in particular scenes such as :Mia apologizing to rikka knowing it was he fault  her home got attack by the robo dogs her dad created

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319849">
         or when the recording rikka found in her fam basement where it gives her a decisive choice on how to live her life.<br />
<br />

    Going into this movie, I wasn’t sure what to expect. The visuals looked great and it was one of the only anime movies I had seen to get a simultaneous world-wide release, streaming on Crunchyroll for those of us in other countries who couldn’t go see it in theaters. Unfortunately, it seems that the release strategy is the biggest praise I can give this movie.<br />
<br />
Story: 3/10<br />
To put it simply, this is a mixture of a revenge story and a set-up for some presumed sequel story. It feels very much like the first film in a superhero series, the one that sets up the hero and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319719">
        their backstory and lays down the motivations and character traits. Unfortunately, it does this fairly poorly, leaving nothing but a predictable and shallow narrative. I won’t spoil anything, but trust me when I say that what you expect after the first 10 minutes is exactly what you get. <br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
The visuals are quite well done, though they seem to be at a quality I would more often associate with a TV series than a full movie. The art does its job, most of the character animation is good, but doesn’t stand out as anything too special. Some of the visual design is quite interesting, particularly the effects used for the animal drones and the camo outfits, but nothing you can’t find elsewhere. One thing to note is that the 3D used here is very uninspired and stands out like a sore thumb. I am a fan of 3D when it is used well, Houseki no Kuni and Last Exile being excellent examples of how to do 3D properly. This is not one of them. Even in the opening credits we can see really cheap looking character models in the backgrounds, and it is very distracting and unintentionally humorous.<br />
<br />
Sound/Music: 7/10<br />
The audio of this film is truly the only thing I fully enjoyed. The music is well done, fits the mood, and makes you feel like what you are watching is actually something to get excited over. The sound design is also good, though seems to be muddled a bit by the constant bombastic score of the music. Not that bombastic music is an issue, especially in what is essentially a superhero movie. Unfortunately, while the music is good, it feels as though it could be slapped into any futuristic action/adventure movie and it would fit just as well.<br />
<br />
Character:  5/10<br />
The characters are interesting in their own right, though the quality varies greatly. The protagonist(s) are fairly well designed and like-able, both in design and personality. However, the antagonist(s) are incredibly predictable and uninspired. They feel as though they were ripped straight out of a bargain 1970’s western comic book and then painted with an even more boring coat of paint. They are one of my biggest gripes with the movie as a whole, to the point that not even a good protagonist can help.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 4/10<br />
Despite my massive gripes with the story, there is still some enjoyment to be had here. You do have to take the entire movie for what it is, however: a cheese-fest superhero origin story. I found myself smiling at certain parts, especially in the first 30 minutes, but that quickly trickled off into a fairly constant stream of face-palms toward the end.<br />
<br />
Overall: 5/10<br />
I would only really recommend this movie to fans of western superheroes. It gives off a very strong Marvel superhero group vibe, so if you are a fan of that and can look past the predictable and lazy story, then perhaps you will find some enjoyment here. Unfortunately for me, I hate everything to do with the western superhero “genre”, and this movie did nothing more than remind me of why I do. I’m sure there will be lots of people out there that enjoy this a lot, and if that’s you, then great. As for me, I don’t plan on revisiting this any time soon. Perhaps a sequel (or series) could flesh things out and provide a more interesting plot, but I have my doubts.

    Black fox is cliche personified, it relies on cliches and overused narratives so often I was able to call out exactly what the entire movie was going to be about within the first twenty minutes.<br />
now, there are cliche anime movies I like (Sword of the stranger, Redline), so I wouldn&#039;t call this an inherent flaw. but the movie seems entirely unaware of its own cliches. Both Redline and Sword of the stranger have ways to separate themselves from others of their kin, be it through art style and wacky animation (Redline), or attempting to overlay an unusual tone on what is otherwise a cliche story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319525">
        (Sword of the stranger).<br />
This movie doesn&#039;t only fail to do so, it also fails to be the best of its compatriots.<br />
<br />
Story: &quot;yo, we heard you like cliches, so we put cliches on your cliche!&quot; -a definitely real quote from Nomura Kazuya<br />
This story is possibly the biggest pile of cliches ive ever seen, a scientist develops advanced technology for the betterment of mankind, but an old friend insists they use it for war. the scientist disagrees. <br />
GUESS WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? HMMMMMM, I WONDER?<br />
This makes it predictable, and mostly unexciting. it has all the tropes youre already sick to death of, and treads absolutely zero new ground. the story is nothing special, and indeed, nothing good.<br />
<br />
Art: clearly the budget for this movie was not very large. Though the fight scenes look passable, the rest of it looks awful. CG crowds shamble around in a twisted mockery of life, scenery manages to look so unappealing that i begin to pity said CG crownds, and someone forgot to tell Kazuya that holding on shots of CG people is a REALLY bad idea. I do enjoy the protagonists&#039; design, however.<br />
<br />
Sound: its fine, it works. no complaints, its nothing special but its passable.<br />
<br />
Character: Clearly whoever wrote the script for this movie forgot that youre supposed to actually develop your characters. as the most we get is a few chess scenes. And there are some characters who die with so little development I think the writers forgot character deaths were supposed to matter to the audience.<br />
<br />
im not doing enjoyment, i think its pretty clear how i feel.<br />
<br />
<br />
so basically, there are MUCH better ways to spend 90 minutes. dont waste it on this movie, its not worth it. I think we all deserve more from our entertainment <br />

    It felt like someone wrote the script for a 12 episode anime, but was then only given a 1.5h movie, so they had to cut half of the scenes. Nothing you haven&#039;t seen before and a poor attempt at creating some sort of anime version of a marvel origin story.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story 3/10<br />
<br />
The story was already quite bland to begin with, but due to the before mentioned rushing it got even worse. It really doesn&#039;t try anything new and it&#039;s just a weird revenge/find yourself story without any major plot-twists or developments that would help the viewer to engage with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art 8/10<br />
<br />
Probably the best part of this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319344">
        movie. The art and animations were very good. Most of the time it was quite smooth, the action scenes felt great and there wasn&#039;t too much bad CG in here. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound 7/10<br />
<br />
It was alright. No soundtrack I could listen to 24/7, but good enough for what it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character 3/10<br />
<br />
And here we go again...The characters and their relationships were incredibly simplistic and one-dimensional. And while there is character development it&#039;s honestly just predictable and boring to watch. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall I give this movie a 4/10.

    Disclaimer: I could not find a manga or source material so I did not read the source material if there is any, I only watched the movie. <br />
<br />
Story 3/10: The story is very predictable, as many others are saying as well. Nothing stands out as very unique. This serves as a decent introduction to a series, but as a standalone movie there isn&#039;t much that makes it interesting. I found myself wanting the movie to be over about halfway through. Although I can say it got better at the end, but not by much. <br />
<br />
Art 7/10: The 2D animation is beautiful but ruined in certain

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319266">
        parts by extremely poorly blended 3D animation. Studios should know by now that it can and has been blended well before, so for a full length movie to have poor CG is unfortunate. There are definitely parts you can tell the budget went to and that&#039;s where the anime shines, but it definitely feels like the movie had a series budget overall and couldn&#039;t afford to put too much effort into it&#039;s entirety. The CG is what loses 3 points off of an otherwise well animated movie. An extremely well animated section of scenes is what saves the art score, you&#039;ll know it when you watch it. <br />
<br />
Sound 8/10: I really enjoyed the sound of this movie. I think this is one area that actually turned out great. I recommend watching with headphones. Certain character&#039;s voices are just fun to listen to because of the sound design. <br />
<br />
Character 4/10: Every character is shallow, but they have potential. The entire movie just felt like it was a set up for an actual series. They all have something that could be good character motivation, but it was so rushed that you don&#039;t have time to process it; it doesn&#039;t feel like the characters have enough time to process it either. The characters aren&#039;t dynamic but will flip flop ideals in less than 60 seconds. I found that a little annoying. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 4/10: It is pretty to look at for a few scenes, but the story and characters aren&#039;t developed. I enjoyed watching for the well animated scenes, but it wasn&#039;t worth watching for 90 minutes. The end leaves you wanting more, but it&#039;s because the movie itself doesn&#039;t deliver much. <br />
<br />
Overall 5/10: The art and sound bring this anime up but the characters and story are so boring that I can&#039;t really recommend it wholeheartedly. All I can say is that the story has potential. It&#039;s not bad but it&#039;s not great in my opinion. I wish they would&#039;ve broken this into episodes and made it a prologue to a series. That being said, I&#039;ll be keeping an eye on this one to see where they decide to take the story and I&#039;m hoping for a bright future for what could be a good action series.

    The story isn&#039;t particularly original but that&#039;s not always a bad thing. <br />
<br />
My only real gripes would come from the choice in camera angles and pacing to fights, it felt as if the animation was a bit blurry during moments that could have sold the action. <br />
<br />
I think the characters were okay enough and fun even if they were all a bit one-note. The score and sound design helped to make for an enjoyable time.<br />
<br />
A long intro was welcomed here since the preview episode might have been missed, it was a solid way to introduce characters and set-up the overall narrative. The pacing of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319131">
        plot was nice even though the runtime chased it to the finish line.<br />
<br />
I wouldn&#039;t watch it again but I won&#039;t lie and say I didn&#039;t enjoy the end product, worth the watch.

    Not a bad movie by any means, but nothing great either. It ends up being a kind of &quot;superhero origin story&quot; type narrative, which isn&#039;t bad but ultimately cannot overcome a lot of clichés. <br />
<br />
If I knew a second movie or tv series was going to follow up on the plot, I would watch it, since its conclusion is rather open-ended. In terms of the studio, Studio 3Hz, I found Flip Flappers and Gun Gale Online to have much better animation and aesthetic appeal than this movie. However, if you&#039;re looking for a little inspiration, you may find some here.<br />
<br />
Story 7/10<br />
Average and full of clichés.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337298">
        Nothing you haven&#039;t seen before in anime. I liked how the main character Lily was conflicted between being like her ninja grandfather or her scientist father, and how she could be both. However, the movie moved a little too fast to really flesh this out and let you identify with the weight of any character&#039;s feelings.<br />
<br />
Art style 7/10<br />
Average quality of an anime tv series (even though it&#039;s a movie and was in theaters). Character designs are okay, but nothing stands out aside from Lily/ Black Fox. Colors and settings are kind of bland (the main visual is more colorful than the movie).<br />
<br />
Animation 7/10<br />
Average anime quality. Fight scenes are pretty good, 3D robots could be worse, but the 3D crowds are a bit jarring.<br />
<br />
Music 7/10<br />
Average. Does its job in setting the scene but doesn&#039;t stand out.<br />
<br />
Editing 7/10<br />
Average.<br />
<br />
Voice Acting 8/10<br />
Pretty good. No complaints.<br />

    I enjoyed the movie, no regret in watching it. The story could have used more but I think the writer/director of the movie was given a time limit and sadly had to make it fit. The movie was really enjoyable and I’d love to see it as a series. <br />
<br />
Overall:8 3/4 (wasn’t quite a 9 but was better than an 8 so I gave it a 9)<br />
Explanation at bottom. <br />

Story:7<br />
 As I said above, it felt like it was enjoyable but would be much better had it of had more time. If it was given a series, I think it would be great and I’d

        love to watch it. As for the events and how they unfolded, some say it predictable, while I can see that and would disagree, in story telling, the story usually follows a set path. You are introduced to the main character, given some background, then something happens which sets the MC on they’re journey. In this case it was similar to super heroes, more specifically DC comics, where it’s a tragedy that sets the character on their path. Overall I could see what they were going for and I enjoyed it. More time would have been better though. <br />
<br />
Art:10<br />
I really enjoyed the art. It was nice. Did it stand out and try to make a name for itself, no, but I didn’t have any problems with it. The art was nice and clean. <br />
<br />
Sound:10<br />
The music was good. It felt nice and like it belonged. Don’t remember if there was an opening as I started watching late at night and was too tired so I only watched 12 minutes before pausing it to pickup the next day. As for the ending song it was nice. <br />
<br />
Character:8<br />
As stated above, it felt like it should of been a series rather than movie. BUT, the way the characters acted didn’t seemed forced. It felt natural.  The main character even is shown trying o figure out who she is. Does she want to be like her father or her grandfather. Both seemed to be a huge part of her upbringing. The white haired girl (forgot her name, this is embarrassing) while she doesn’t have tons of growth, her character makes sense. She holds onto hope for her father, despite clearly being a lunatic. Most people have a weakness for family and for her, it made sense as it seemed she didn’t get along with other kids. Overall the characters actions all made sense. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
It had a nice pace to it. Honestly I wish it had more to it, not just because it would have been better as a series but also because I really enjoyed it. If this is given a series, or another movie, I would watch it. <br />
<br />
Overall, the show is worth the watch. While I can understand some not liking the show as they’ve seen way more anime than I have, I will say that I enjoy a good story. Always have. If you’re looking for something to pass 90 minutes, I’d say give it a try. Or if you’re just looking for something to watch in general. I honestly believe it’s well worth the watch. Hopefully you’ll be able to find enjoyment in the show as well.
