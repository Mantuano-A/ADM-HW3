    Da Capo is not for everyone. Especially anti-bishoujo vigilantes who&#039;d surely find plenty of flaws to reinforce their misconceptions of a very very misunderstood class of anime. However, for those who are willing to look beyond its sub-tag of &#039;harem&#039; and &amp;quot;eroge (adult games) conversion&amp;quot;, you might just find an anime gem that few in the genre can outsparkle. <br />
<br />
Story - 8<br />
<br />
Da Capo has a very interesting premise and is a surprisingly coherent story. It achieves this in 2 ways. First, by never forgetting the thrust of the series. It could be an episode featuring one of the numerous side characters or typical high school

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6476">
        hijinks yet it never fails to leverage on these situations to further develop the central plot or characters. Grafting the various characters&#039; stories onto the overarching theme is the 2nd avenue by which the series remains relevant despite its seemingly meandering series composition. Although I have to say the the first 15 eps could have been a lot tighter which accounts for the mildly-diminished score of 8 for this segment. Nevertheless, the series more than makes up for it with tightly-knitted and well paced 2nd half (ep 16 onwards). <br />
<br />
Art - 9<br />
<br />
For a 2003 production, the animation quality was nothing to write home about. The definition of art here extends beyond mere portrayal of visuals that the eyes can capture but sight that can touch the human heart. Da Capo clinches a 9 for this category because of its excellent art direction (which frankly is probably lost on most anime viewers.) Artistic scene transitions, panning shots that accentuate the mood of the scene etc are just some of the reasons why I believe Da Capo to have one of the finest cinematography in the genre. <br />
<br />
Sound - 9<br />
<br />
Da Capo soundtrack is undoubtedly the best of the genre. Not only are the pieces beautiful standalone musical compositions, their effect is greatly magnified in the various poignant scenes when employed skillfully under the anointed direction of the Da Capo crew, making its musical component one of the most memorable aspect of the production. <br />
<br />
Character - 8<br />
<br />
Da Capo has an endearing cast which sadly was not fully developed, at least for many of the fabulous side-haremettes. Again the series more than makes up for it with its wonderfully fleshed out leads. By digging deep into their psyche, motivations and struggles, one cannot help but empathize strongly with these girls binded by chains of cruel love. Few harem series does &#039;love&#039; and even fewer do it with the depth and maturity of Da Capo <br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 10<br />
<br />
Well-crafted characters, poignant drama, impeccable music and an artistic flair to meld all these ingredients into a solid production is the reason why I enjoyed the series to. the. fullest. <br />
<br />
Give DC a shot if you are not adverse to the much maligned bishoujo genre. Recommended only if you have an open mind, loves good drama, coherent plots and consistent characters.

    Okay, so it&#039;s one of the most popular harem titles in japan, probably only second to KEY&#039;s big hits. It&#039;s even tiring to try to track the amount of side stories and sequels and doujin productions for this huge title. <br />
But surprisingly despite all the hype this series gains, it totally killed all my expectations. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Okay honestly it started pretty nice.. with all the moe charm points you would find in any harem title. But it isnt really cool when the introduction episodes are cut to half time and u&#039;re forced to watch gravure videos of some of the seiyuus. they could have put more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23809">
        effort into developing the story. <br />
So when the real story actually started honestly thought it would be great. but it disappointed me at every turn. most of the plot is too cliche, too flat, too boring. i couldnt help sighing and hoping it would end sooner in the last 4 episodes. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The only thing commendable is probably the art, which is obviously the inspiration of many of the moe animes out nowadays. this is one of the main reason i watched this anime. everywhere you go in akihabara, you see da capo&#039;s art. it&#039;s that impressive. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
I understand that &#039;da capo&#039; is a musical term, so i was expecting some beautiful music. instead, it&#039;s so poor that i had to skip the OP and ED and sigh at all the scenes that were supposed to be touching. it&#039;s disappointing that they didnt work more on the music. as for the seiyuus, the big names are all over the place, so there&#039;s really not much to complain about.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Wow we have so many moe characters. You have your imouto, loli, osananajimi, senpai, and even an esper! What should we do? Decorate them in your bedroom! Yes, that&#039;s very much all there is to the characters in Da Capo. well, some of them have interesting backgrounds and personalities.. but in the anime they&#039;re prematurely developed, and leave much to desire. the characters are like pictures of people without a background. beautifully drawn, but shallow and monotonous.<br />
And the worst character i&#039;ve seen in a very long time is the main male character. each of his scripts make me sigh and wish it would end right there and then. it&#039;s so painful to see that pitiful soul. oh god please strike him with a bolt of lightning.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I started watching this with a lot of expectation, but the result is overwhelming disappointment. I should have been able to finish this in one day, but i couldnt stand watching it straight.. the shortcomings are so terrible it&#039;s depressing.. im not depressed because of the melancholy in the story, but because of the bad story.. sighs.. <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
A good example of animes which dont live up to their popularity and fame. If you&#039;re going to watch this, make sure you&#039;re ready for disappointment

    Story: 5/10~5.5/10 Its a pretty decent story. Its your average romance comedy, with a sample of drama and magic. Even so, I didn&#039;t find anything that particularly there that interested me, except maybe the &amp;quot;Forbidden Sibling Love&amp;quot;. There are also a few things that I found &amp;quot;cheesy&amp;quot; such as: &amp;quot;The Island where sakura trees never wilt&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A love struggle between girls&amp;quot; as well as classic harem scenarios. When it first began I kinda enjoyed it, but I started to lose interest the mid to mid-last episodes as they focused more on  the relationship between the two of the leads and the main male lead,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1303">
        and condensed individual character stories in to one or two episodes. But I guess its worth watching if you have never watched anime based off of visual novels and other this anime of this genre.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10~8.5/10 The art I must admit is good. The scenes are exceptionally drawn, especially many night scenes and a few morning scenes. The characters are also pretty well drawn for 4 years ago as well, not that art has drastically changed. But for anime based off of visual novels you should expect any less than great animation.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10 Ok I am a bit biased on soundtracks and music, since I am a music fanatic. The OP and ED songs aren&#039;t that shabby. I also enjoyed a most of the insert songs as well. However the OP song grew tedious after a while (maybe the for first 12 episodes I listened and watch). But its a commendable soundtrack nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Character: 6/10 You&#039;ve got the standard package of characters for a usual harem. One main male lead To be honest I liked most of the characters in the series however, there are some I got a bit irritated with (Such as Nemu and Sakura, but I still love them alot nonetheless) after a bit. But the reason why I gave it a lower score was because the character development in the episodes seem kinda shallow and only concentrated on a few of the characters, rather than developing some of the other supposed leads in the series.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6.0/10~6.5/10 There were times that I enjoyed it, like in the beginning, and times I felt like dropping it around the middle and mid-end. I guess the last few episodes covering the stories of individual characters was enough to satisfy me to watch and moderately enjoy the end as complete the first season of the series.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6/10~7/10 I guess the last episodes played a large factor in my final decision of the series. I was wavering in my final rate between 6~7.  I didn&#039;t particularly enjoy this season as much as I would&#039;ve liked as other visual novels, but I guess the presentation was fine enough for me to look into the next seasons.

    To be perfectly honest, I don&#039;t see what&#039;s bad about Da Capo except for the storyline; the characters are well drawn, they have unique and amusing personalities but aren&#039;t made to be &#039;over the top&#039;. Throughout the anime, we see six different girls&#039; relationship with the male protagonist Jyuunichi Asakura improve and we see that they all have feelings for him. However, we only see two of the girls actually confront each other about their feelings for Jyuunichi (i think that this is great since the story would probably go on for too long if all of the girls began to fight each other), these

        are Nemu and Sakura. The anime also shows us the past of Jyuunichi&#039;s life which strongly involved both Sakura and Nemu, nice touch in my opinion, perhaps a little bit too typical but still very nice.<br />
<br />
The music in Da Capo is awesome. Since the title is a musical term, this is kind of a necessity (some of you may disagree). <br />
<br />
The art is very nice, since the anime is set in an island where sakuras are forever blooming, lots of the scenes have elegant and pretty floating sakura petals. If you&#039;re anything like me, you&#039;ll love it. The only problem might be the two wierd cats Mr, ~I dont know if this counts as a spoiler so I won&#039;t write its name~, and Utamaru. You can argur that Utamaru has a uniquely charming appearance but I prefer the typical cute nekos.<br />
<br />
This is where the anime starts going downhill. The storyline or lines are not the best (to put it politely). The main storyline is just like most of the other typical Harems where a boy is loved by a few girls but finally chooses one that he loves after going through a series of arcs with the others. The main problem is the &#039;side story&#039;, this is a part in the anime where it is completely cut off from the main story. It is a meaningless and stupidly melancholic five minutes (or sometimes more) of the female characters of the anime encounters. . .a human cat. . .nuff said...<br />
<br />
Despite the side stories, I enjoyed this anime very much and it was very refreshing...since the last anime I saw was so horribly made that I didn&#039;t put it on my anime list.

    On an island where cherry blossoms bloom all year-round, love seems to always be in the air. It is in this magical atmosphere that Asakura Junnichi lives, and when he dreams he travels to the dreams of others, rather than have any of his own. In everyday high-school life, he is accompanied by his adopted sister, Nemu, and an eclectic group of friends including a j-pop idol-in-the-making and a girl they knew from their childhood. Promises, and magic, and love -- Junnichi seems to dream about every girl he knows, but which girl dreams of him...?<br />

Story (9/10)<br />
Been a while since i last did a review

          <span style="display: none;" id="review69205">
        around here, think some people pretty much missed me, anyway after i came across this &quot;hidden gem&quot; titled as Da Capo i was abit amazed, impressed of how good this show was. Yeah, i admit, i do love harem animes, even though they are not so realistic (and this show lacks it all) i was pretty much impressed of how good this one was, all this stuff were tied out together in such a nice way, that it made me marathon this show until the end (my god, i dun even wanna remember, i spent almost 10 hours in a row watching this show, without taking breaks, only going to bathroom, still remember how pissed were some people, however i think it worth it). The story is centered on a teenage, high school student named Jun&#039;ichi Asakura. He lives together with his sister Nemu Asakura on an island named Hatsunejima, a mysterious island, having cherry trees that bloom and never wither. The story follows Jun&#039;ichi as he interacts with other people, such as his friend Suginami and socializing with other girls such as Mako, her older sister Moe, the school idol Shirakawa Kotori, the energetic, cheerful banana addict Amakase Miharu and his childhood friend Sakura Yoshino. At first glance, Jun&#039;ichi seems like a normal high-school student though actually he has the power to wield magic, but he is refered to be a failure, he inherited the blood of the Yoshino family yet he did not succeed in becoming a true magic user, like Sakura. As the story goes on, Nemu and Jun&#039;ichi grow closer, becoming more like lovers, one thing that is not mentioned is that actualy Nemu and Jun&#039;ichi are not blood related siblings, which is a relief, just the though that this might turn into an incestuous anime, kinda made me dislike it anyway because of this fact i continued watching it. The mysterious island of Hatsunejima has a lot to offer, from a tree that always has cherry-blossoms and never withers, that grants wishes and can understand the pure hearts of people, this tree actualy plays an important role here mainly because most of the people that Jun&#039;ichi interacted with, including the closest ones such as Nemu and Sakura, made a wish at that tree, and not only them. As Nemu and Jun&#039;ichi grow closer to one another, Sakura becomes more and more eager to end their relationship. Like i said this is probably one of the most unrealistic romance stories i ever watched but its one that i truly enjoyed, lets be serious who wouldn&#039;t love (pointing especially to guys) to have a harem of girls around him. The first half of Da Capo starts as an romantic comedy, funny as hell, entertaining, that draws a smile on your face, but the second half turns into a serious drama, so dramatic that you might think that this will actually end tragically (there is a second season as well though so nothing to loose).<br />
<br />
Animation and Sound (8&#039;5/10)<br />
Not bad in terms of animation, as expected from an anime that is inspired from visual novel even though its an erotic one actually. I pretty much liked how the characters were designed, some with funny looks other with appropriate looks. In terms of sound, the opening and endings are more orientated for an female audience, did not really like them as much as i did like the background sounds. <br />
<br />
Characters (10/10)<br />
Surely, Da Capo shines in terms of characters. So many characters, with such different personalities, this is one of the things that makes Da Capo worth watching. All and i mean all of the character were developed more or less, giving some details about even though they were not that accurate, it gave a better taste to this show. Jun&#039;ichi is not really my type of favorite character and still i wonder how come he managed to create his own harem, considering that he is such a boring guy. The shy Kotori, the violent Mako, the slow and cheerful Moe, the energetic Miharu, the annoying Sakura, all of them are like one of a kind, so different personalities yet they were able to get along, however all of them started to grow feelings towards Jun&#039;ichi.<br />
<br />
Overall (9/10)<br />
In one word, amazing, Da Capo surely impressed me, and i recommend this show to everyone, making abstraction of anime tastes and stuff like that, this is entertaining, funny, cute, dramatic, it has all the stuff that an anime should have tied toghether. Anyway at how good this first season was it would be ashame to stop at it, the other ones are even better, with much more story/character development. Fans of Akane Iro ni Somaru Saka should definitely try this one out.

<br />
A great mix of a story, characters, and setting.<br />
<br />
A MUST WATCH ANIME.

    Genre: Drama, Romance, Magic, Comedy<br />
Episode:26<br />
OP-Sakura saku mirai koiyume, Sonzai<br />
ED-Mirai he no Melody, Utamaru Ekaki Uta, Sonzai, Sakura saku mirai koiyume<br />
<br />
On the island where the Sakura are full bloom all year round, the wishes of the people are granted. Asakura lives with his younger sister, Nemu, where they are not blood related. One day a childhood friend, Sakura moves back and immediately starts to get together with Asakura, however his lies with his sister...<br />
<br />
Story-6/10-The story seems like any other romance/drama series.. except with the twist of magic, which has minor influence on the overall story. There are a lot of bizzare things that are made to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1128">
        seem &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;. There are three phases in the storyline, the beginning is all introductions, a happier time, then comes the mysterious phase, where the relationship between Asakura and everyone else is shown, and then the last phase where the situations are a lot more tense and serious. I liked the beginning and middle of this series... the ending was a little too weird and stiff..and too focused on three people..The unique thing about the series is that in the last couple of minutes in some of the episode there will be a focus on one character just walking around.<br />
<br />
Characters-6/10-There are about two main male characters.. with the rest being girls.. and more than half of them develope a secret crush on Asakura sometime during the series. The good thing is that, their feelings are more covert, so its not exactly a harem series.. Its pretty obvious that the main conflicts are between Nemu and Asakura.. There is character development in the minor characters.. but not much in the main characters which is okay, for the main characters help develop everyone else. What is really interesting is how... *Spoiler*Some characters actually actually &amp;quot;leave&amp;quot; the series towards the end. The relationship between Nemu and Asakura is a bit weird, in that their actions seem too unnatural.<br />
<br />
Music-6/10-The OP/ED are both average. The soundtrack is composed of lots of slow/depressing songs as well as some &amp;quot;happier&amp;quot; ones, which really reflect the wide range of emotions the series goes through. The seiyuus are all pretty good.<br />
<br />
Animation-7/10-There some really nice day/night scenery shots during the endings of each episode as they focus on one specific character strolling around or whatever. The art is pretty good, with average animation backing it up.<br />
<br />
Value/Enjoyment-6/10This is a pretty average romance/drama series, with all the cliches... I liked the series in the beginning as everything seemed atleast normal, then the second half came along and everything went all dark, depressing and just weird.<br />
<br />
Overall-6/10

    Da Capo is an anime that could be best described as &quot;harem watcher&#039;s bible&quot; or better yet, &quot;the holy grail of haremdom&quot;. It&#039;s because this anime focuses immensely on the harem aspect and makes it glaringly obvious even to the most oblivious of watchers from the word go. However, despite the initial simplicity of the plot and the fact that the gargantuan harem sub-plot makes most dramatic confessions, turns, cliffhangers etc. easy to foresee, the overall story still manages to grab the attention of the average watcher, intrigue him/her and deliver an enjoyable experience.<br />
<br />
Before I continue, note that this review will cover both Da Capo

          <span style="display: none;" id="review118589">
        and Da Capo second season. <br />
<br />
STORY (7/10) :<br />
<br />
The story, initially, appears to be fairly simplistic. On a small island called &#039;Hatsune&#039; lives a teenage boy named Junichi along with his step sister and a swarm of other characters with varying degrees of importance. They live blissfully on the island, lost in their own dreams/goals, completely isolated from the outside world. One day, that blissful status quo is broken by the appearance of a new character, Sakura. That point marks the true beginning of the story.<br />
<br />
From the on, for the most part it&#039;s about Junichi, his harem, and the difficulties associated with having a large female following (internal tensions, romance etc.). The story does however delve into some interesting issues later on, especially in Da Capo second season. If you&#039;re a fan of magic or otherwise supernatural occurrences then boy do I have good news for you as this anime will allocate considerable time towards those themes and even touch upon some philosophy. The second season is in general, going to get more complex and draw the viewer in much more than the first. <br />
<br />
The only problem I have with this section is that the romance component of Da Capo was way too predictable. I could literally make out what the outcome of a certain relationship was going to be episodes before it was due to be resolved. The makers should have definitively put more uncertainty into the story to make it more engaging rather that making the characters follow a seemingly linear path as that kind of ruins your watching experience.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS (8/10) :<br />
<br />
This is without a doubt the strong component of Da Capo. Despite the fact that the characters seem to follow known archetypes, they still posses plenty of originality thanks to a combination of factors such as an unusual setting, magical &amp; supernatural themes coupled with a harem subplot. <br />
<br />
The interactions between the male lead and the rest of the predominantly female cast almost always have a romantic &amp; haremesque vibe to it. However, when that gets boring enough viewers will find respite in Utamaru&#039;s adventures or Suginami&#039;s hilarious analogies (Two comic relief characters by the way). The show manages to maintain a healthy balance between drama and comedy all throughout. <br />
<br />
The second season will start to weigh more heavily towards the dramatic side, as the female cast of Da Capo goes through a period of inevitable self-evaluation and some much needed soul searching, especially with Aishia&#039;s arrival. Old grievances &amp; wounds born anew, the cast will indeed go through a storm. <br />
<br />
The problem with the character section lies entirely within the male lead. He is spineless beyond belief. I can understand a teenage male to be fairly indecisive and lazy but this guy needs his step-sister to change his diapers. He&#039;s like a leaf thrown about by the wind; his actions shaped too easily by the opinions of his peers. Additionally, apart from his &quot;kindness&quot; he has no single redeeming quality which makes it harder for the viewer to believe that any of the girls would actually harbor any earnest feelings towards him. <br />
<br />
ART (9/10) :<br />
<br />
The art is really good, especially if one considers the year of release for this anime. The concept for the island of Hatsune is interesting and its visualisation even better. Whether it be the cherry blossom trees, the school or the Shinto shrine; everything&#039;s been animated with near-perfection. <br />
<br />
Likewise the characters have been carefully drawn, with attention being paid to all the little details. That said however, at longer distances this attention seems to slack off a little bit and characters turn more into stick figures than proper anime characters but that doesn&#039;t happen too often and as I found, will not affect the overall enjoyment of the series.<br />
<br />
SOUND (9/10)<br />
<br />
The sound department contains some truly beautiful pieces. The dramatic scenes in Da Capo are accompanied by music reminiscent of the themes one might find in &#039;Yosuga no Sora&#039;. They definitively help to bring out the seriousness of a given situation and help to make it that much more emotional. The opening and ending themes fit nicely into the overall tone of the anime and make it complete.<br />
<br />
The voice acting itself was completely masterful. I&#039;m a beginner in Japanese, but I can tell when someone&#039;s acting with an earnest conviction. The crying scenes in this anime are absolutely GODLY. The Japanese voice actresses did a superb job, giving you the feeling that you&#039;re truly watching characters who are in a bind rather than watching a character who is voiced by a person who gets paid to say a few lines. Top notch stuff.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT (8/10)<br />
<br />
I enjoyed this anime tremendously despite some of its shortcomings. The romance was too predictable and the male lead was painfully spineless, yes, but nevertheless there was much more to the story than just that. The magical aspect, the whole of Hatsune island, Suginami and his shenanigans etc. <br />
<br />
Overall, a very good anime and a definite recommendation to all out there who enjoy romance/harem themed animes. <br />

    The anime is really not for everbody, but the sense of watching this anime is really something that is not important and less interesting . The characters are no big deal but to put Nemu as a main character is much more irritating to watch the whole anime. Junichi&#039;s powers are way out of nowhere which is not needed to be in the anime. The essence of the story is very much lacking and the whole anime is not consistent to the main story and to the flow of attitudes.

    Da Capo is one of those series that never really stood out outside of its time. It was popular enough to get a second season, as well as a sequel, and a second season of the sequel. However, don&#039;t let that fool you into believing this series is as good as the amount of seasons they threw out. Overall, the anime was a good watch with mostly comedy with some underlying plot. They weren&#039;t able to really express each of the heroines features as well as they should have. But, for its time, it was probably the best thing out at the time as it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review64615">
        was a visual novel adaptation. <br />
<br />
The anime itself really liked to skip around to different events and didn&#039;t really give a good feel of the characters. They skimmed over many of the points so at times, it just seems like the heroines fell in love with the main character out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
I personally hated the main heroine and that really did attribute to the enjoyment of the series. The anime really made her out to be an unlikable character in my opinion. It was almost forced how the main character was able to develop feelings for her, and I just was not able to be satisfied with how the ending turned out.<br />
<br />
Would not recommend this to watch if you&#039;re looking for some good romance or a harem. This series has 1 winner, and all the others lose after having their own personal time with the main character.<br />
<br />
Stick with the visual novel if you want to actually enjoy the series.

    Warning this review may contain spoilers.<br />
<br />
 First impressions, an anime based off a hentai game, sweet let&#039;s see what happens. When I first got into this show I didn&#039;t like it at first, but I gave it a second chance and ended up liking it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 Story 6/10<br />
<br />
 On the island mysterious of Hatsune,<br />
Where the cherry blossom trees bloom all year along.<br />
The smell of love starts to fill the air.<br />
<br />
 It starts with are main character Junnichi has a dream about girl that is going to meet him in the near future. After being woken up by his step sister named Nemu. He starts to make

          <span style="display: none;" id="review202279">
        his way to school.<br />
He then meets his cousin Sakura, for whom they thought was living in America, Sakura has come to finish the promise she made to Junnichi when they where children. The first half is pretty much an episodic story that contains slice of nothing really happens moments<br />
For example, when the main character comes across that cat girl maid or when he just doing his day to day activities.  We slowly see romance starting to take form, which I found somewhat boring to watch.<br />
However, it is necessary, because otherwise I  wouldn&#039;t care about whats happening in the story.<br />
<br />
 The second half is more focused more on the love triangle that has manifested between Junnichi, Nemu and Sakura. Both of them are fighting for his affections, which has been building up over time and comes to the surface for all to see. Our main character, then has to make a choice, which is kind of bittersweet but was essential to furthering the plot. So I thought this was a very relaxing  ]and it does deliver on those feels. Moreover, when the show gets serious, the show handles itself with maturity, which I quite like. Especially because love triangles can turn ugly very quickly.<br />
<br />
 The show wasn&#039;t without its blemishes and negatives. It really is kind of just a standard story that I have seen told many times before. Additionally, for some reason there is some magic elements in this story with the main character and his cousin (who can use magic) and a magic tree that grants wishes. Another problem I did have with magic being in this show is the fact that there isn&#039;t really much explained about how the magic system really works in this world, and any information we are given is pretty vague. It just seems like that the magic in this show can pretty much do anything you want, and yes I know this is a romantic comedy and I shouldn&#039;t take the magic elements seriously. Even though, it&#039;s a simplistic romantic comedy but the lack of information kind of bothered me.<br />
Moreover, I didn&#039;t like magic and I must give them credit  that the magic it made things a lot worse. Therefore, magic impacted the decisions and choices that characters made within the overall story.<br />
<br />
Characters 5/10<br />
<br />
The  main character is pretty much your run of the mill visual novel protagonist, who is kind, thoughtful, and always wants to help people with their problems. Even if he the one who will be the most affected by it. The side characters are also very one note. For example, you have a air headed rich girl and her younger sister who always cook hotpot on the school roof very school day. <br />
There is pretty decent character development with the people in this love triangle. Besides, the above points nothing else warrants a mention. <br />
<br />
Art 6/10<br />
<br />
 The animation is average as a whole. The colours scheme is very vibrant and bright and goes with the lighthearted  one of the show. It has this very cute style it. Also the transition to the the more darker and drama tone of the show with a dim and greyer color scheme. It&#039;s background animation is pretty average. I thought the character design where kind of basic.<br />
<br />
Sound 5/10<br />
<br />
 The ost was pretty forgettable, but it did fit the tone of the show pretty well. Furthermore, the ost was composed by Yuko Kanno, who has worked on other anime osts such as JoJo Bizarre Adventure Stardust Crusaders and Ajin. I thought the voice acting was fine for the most part. The subtitled version was well done.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 6/10 <br />
<br />
 I found it very bland most of the times when I was watching it and the only parts I loved about it was the love triangle parts that moved the story along. I also found it quite relaxing to watch.<br />
<br />
Overall, 6/10 <br />
<br />
 In conclusion, if you like visual novel adaptations or shows that take their drama and romance somewhat seriously,  then you will probably like this show.

Story: <br />
<br />
It was okay once they actually got to it... it seemed to me that this series somewhat delayed itself by making simple 1 episode stories about random girls... when i first started watching this, i felt like i was watching a different anime every episode until about 17... none of the stuff that happened at the beginning really had alot to do with the main point which bugged me a bit. BUT thats just my point of view, others may disagree.<br />
<br />
Art: <br />
<br />
I liked the art.. it wasnt anything out of the ordinary but the colors and faces and hairstyles were cute

          <span style="display: none;" id="review62127">
        to me. I thought the rain pouring down in one scene was extremely impressive. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The sound was fair.. there wasnt any really awesome music that stood out to me or made me want to write down to later look up and listen to again. I am really a huge music critic. I love music and i think it makes up a huge part of the show. It was fair. <br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
The characters were good. They each had their own personality which i did like, the voices were all different and unique. <br />

Enjoyment:<br />

This anime, though it seemed to drag on into non essential plots here and there, waas enjoyable and did make me crack up a few times :) <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Overall this show was pretty good. Nothing awesome to brag about to friends but it had a good amount of romance and comedy.

    What can I say about this, the plot and the characters are just as interesting as cardboard cutouts. The plot is just about the Sakura tree which can grant them any wish, nothing special. The characters are nothing special. There are two annoying characters Nemu &amp; Sakura and I have to see them in the whole Da Capo season. They show me traits like crybaby and whiny. Why must you give me such annoying cast? I really cannot stand crybabies and their voice is so annoying.<br />
<br />
The only likable character is Shirakawa Kotori. It is so sad to see that I get to see her in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review103851">
        few episodes and after that I never see her again. She is smart, kind and lovable.<br />
<br />
Junichi Asakura is a bland and boring person just like Edward Cullen. By the way, Nemu is Junichi&#039;s sister and they cannot be together.<br />
<br />
I just have no choice but to give it a 4.

    I would suggest skipping episode eight. It is an arbitrary recap of the cast and is just another one of the characters&#039; own opinion about how the anime. It recaps everything that you watched in a somewhat comical fashion and only has a few original scenes, but they will not effect the story in the slightest or your overall experience.<br />
<br />
With that random note of information being said, let us begin.<br />
<br />
Da Capo. What can I say about it? It is a nice, deep drama about a brother and sister...<br />
<br />
Okay, that is entirely a lie. Actually, this is a comedy with some twists that is all about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203785">
        the misadventures of Junichi and Nemu, following every typical cliché that we all still find ourselves enjoying in most anime comedies due to the way they are always done slightly different.<br />
<br />
To top things off, we have this little girl named Sakura whom is all cute, frantic and innocent, but starts things off with...well, I will get on that later.<br />
<br />
Aside from her, we have Junichi&#039;s exotic friend, Suginami, whom undergoes so many personality changes that it is best not to keep up with him at all.<br />
<br />
So on and so forth, there are lots of other cast members in this anime and you will enjoy all of them. The humor is actually quite good and you will get a few laughs out of it, despite what I mentioned earlier about its repetition of most comedy elements of most anime. It still has its own unique branding of it, too<br />
<br />
As the warning reads below, this is what I consider the spoilers. This is for you to read in case you are wondering why I was disappointed in the anime, but it spoils the story so much that I have to just leave it under a warning if you still want to watch the anime and experience it for yourself. However, the end of this review is not a spoiler, so you can just skip down to the end of the spoiler to read that.<br />
<br />
(SPOILER BEGINS)<br />
<br />
Also, there is also one more episode that you should skip, and that is the tedious episode fifteen. Well, I did not want to say it alongside the other one, in case you were curious about why I only said there was one episode you should skip; as to avoid making you cringe too much, and because I feel like this might spoil the anime in some way. Firstly, this is, in fact, ANOTHER recap episode; only seven episodes separated from the other one.<br />
<br />
But, why did I just not mention that and move on with the rest of the non-spoiler review? Well, this episode has a pretty noteworthy sentiment that brings up a genre that this website lists about this anime: Drama, which I thought I should not just casually mention.<br />
<br />
But, as it implies, the anime becomes a drama, Yes, from this point onward, the anime will finally be what it should have been fifteen episodes ago: an actual drama. As such, the comedy aspect is still there, but now mixes in with real drama for the first time. And not the comedic drama where Nemu gets mad at Junichi for hanging out with other girls.<br />
<br />
The drama is...stale. Very stale. Quickly, you notice that it turns into something entirely different from what it made itself out to be. It was fine, given this website mentioned it was a drama. In fact, I was actually in the mood for a drama that was already one from the BEGINNING of the anime and mixed that in better with the comedy.<br />
<br />
Okay, I will first say that the abrupt introduction of the drama was not horrible, as it slowly went into it. There are lots of minor elements that were so stale that I can not even remember them; and I just watched them the other day. But, it was a bit strange finding out a lot of these story elements that I did remember, towards the end, all just seemed to lead back to one destination: The Agony of Nemu.<br />
<br />
As I appropriately titled it, the main story of the drama all leads to Nemu suffering quite a bit. Firstly, once you watch the beginning of this, you will be aware in a few minutes that Junichi and Nemu are lovers as they are about to kiss...only for this to be a very misleading buildup to Junichi actually just trying to put his head closer to Nemu in order to check her temperature; something that is common in most anime. And from there, you find out they are siblings.<br />
<br />
However, they are not related by blood, as it also mentions; and this is not referenced again until we get to the drama half of the anime. At least, that I can remember. They might reference it in comedic ways during the comedy half.<br />
<br />
The drama portion takes an unexpected turn for the worst where all this back-story hooha comes into place out of nowhere and we get into one of the most bizarre triangles you will ever see in an anime.<br />
<br />
Remember Sakura, the frantic little girl I mentioned earlier? Yeah, she loves Junichi in a sexual kind of way and wants to be his lover.<br />
<br />
As I said earlier, this is a love triangle, so there is another girl. Is it one of the other female cast members, perhaps?<br />
<br />
Nope, it is Nemu. Well this might not sound wrong, given Nemu is not related to Junichi by blood, they did have a sibling relationship for many years. However, apparently, Nemu loved Junichi the whole time...also sexually as a lover. Which was quite the well timed realization of why Nemu got so jealous whenever Junichi was hanging out with a girl during the comedy half. So, Nemu never saw him as a brother, but Junichi saw her as a little sister.<br />
<br />
Nemu gives light hints of her love for him during the comedy half, but makes it much more articulate during the drama half; with Junichi eventually finding out when she confesses it. However, Junichi apparently loved Sakurai back as well, but was just shrouding it as brotherly love. So, in the end, there is no true incestual problems with them dating, in a cosmic sort of way.<br />
<br />
Then, Sakura takes a turn for the worst and develops a heavily repressed hatred for Nemu. If you noticed in the genres, &quot;Magic&quot; was one of them. Well, truthfully, I actually still do not want to spoil this part as it will require too much elaboration to explain here, so I will disregard that last statement.<br />
<br />
Ironically, despite Sakura being against the two dating because she still believes they are siblings in some way due to her seeing them that way for so many years, even though the two are not actually related, Sakura is Junichi&#039;s cousin.<br />
<br />
Yes, when I said &quot;I will get on that later&quot; this was not for my non-spoiler portion of the review. What Sakura did when she first met Junichi again was kiss him, which shocked Nemu. And, well, now we know why. It was not just because they were cousins, as we innocently thought...well, also maybe because of Sakura being a little girl too, which we also thought. I know I said I would not elaborate on the Magic aspects in this review, but I will just spoil one instance of it: Sakura is actually not a little girl, but is the same age as Junichi; only still looking like a little girl because she never actually aged physically.<br />
<br />
So, the love triangle is of Nemu, Junichi&#039;s non-related sister; and Sakura, whom has a heavy infatuation for her favorite male cousin. Of course, this anime has a very heavy harem element too, so nearly every other girl that Junichi meets actually...loves him as well. But, those loves do not really compare to Nemu and Sakura&#039;s.<br />
<br />
So, in the end, the drama half is basically just light comedy elements, and other drama ones too; that build into this whole love triangle between Junichi, Nemu and Sakura.<br />
<br />
(SPOILER ENDS)<br />
<br />
In my personal opinion, I do not recommend the anime...beyond the first fourteen episodes. The later half just brings forth this weird atmosphere that I did not really get into as much as I did the comedy.. Funny to get into the comedy aspect of an anime that is singled out as a &quot;Drama&quot; on its page. But, I did like it a lot more than the drama that it had, so what can I do? It is the truth.<br />
<br />
Again, as I said before, unless you are just reading this now and did not read the spoiler portion, the way you see the anime is mostly up to what you enjoy. If you like dramas a lot, you might have a heavier understanding for this anime than I did. Otherwise, if you usually prefer comedy and the occasional drama, just skip the drama part of this anime. To me, this would not be worth your time.

    Story-7<br />
The story was trying to be serious but failed because the lack of character development. There were episodes where each girl had their own episode but their stories were mediocre and not surprising.At the earlier episodes where the &quot;cat man&quot; appeared were very interesting and asked the viewers who was that guy but the episode that &quot;revealed&quot; him disappointed me.<br />
<br />
Art-5<br />
The art is dated and is average.<br />
<br />
Sound-5<br />
What irks me was Kotori singing but it was again average and nothing memorable. <br />
<br />
Character-6<br />
Nemu and Sakura battling for Junichi was not a surprise. The internal conflict of Sakura did not even come to fruition til later episodes and that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review69975">
        disappointed me.Miharu&#039;s story was a pretty good one but the rest of the female cast was quite lacking. A more thorough development of Misaki or Kotori would be more interesting. I would have preferred more backstory to Suginami. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment-6<br />
The story had its ups and downs but slightly more ups. Some of the &quot;catman&quot; stories were funny others were just boring. The cliff hangers at the end of some episodes were not as expected but disappointing.<br />
<br />
Overall-6<br />
Dated back to 2003, the genre is not at all old. It is just an average harem but don&#039;t expect much.

    In my mind, this work is essentially a classic; it&#039;s an interesting harem with unique characters and a splash of magic. There is a good splattering of romantic comedy early on before developing into a fairly serious drama. It happens that this anime turned out nice for me but it&#039;s not for everyone. If you need a reminder of what good&#039;ol harem meant, definitely give this or Love Hina a try.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
Though the styling is obviously dated by today&#039;s standards, it was pretty good for its time. Some people think the female characters look overly cute but I thought it was fine. Given the magical surrounding

          <span style="display: none;" id="review202702">
        the sakura trees, expect lots of sakura blossoms.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The music in the entire franchise is pretty special, and it all started with Yozuca&#039;s melodic opening here. The BGM is orchestral and similar to that in To Heart. However, there are moments of high tension where the OST just adds that extra touch. The BGM always reminded me of a circus for some reason, and though that association isn&#039;t necessarily correct mood-wise it definitely made it memorable.<br />
<br />
The voice acting cast was very good and includes some very well known seiyuu. Yukari Tamura did great here and, obviously, Yui Horie&#039;s character, Kotori, became ridiculously popular.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The plot is pretty simple at first. It shows Jun&#039;ichi going to school and making friends with many girls, while also conjuring some fairly humorous incidents. Once all the characters have been well introduced, the twists begins as each girl apparently harbors some feelings for Jun&#039;ichi. From this point on, the tone of the series becomes much more serious and intense.<br />
<br />
Magic plays a part in the latter half which deals with people&#039;s dreams (as in goals/desires) and what happens when those dreams are taken away.<br />
<br />
Overall, the themes are all tied together near the end and the conclusion is very satisfying (yes, D.C. has a second series but you could easily just end it at the first series and be fully satisfied).<br />
<br />
There are also side episodes attached to some of the episodes which don&#039;t have anything to do with the main story. Some are just for humor while others deal with a mysterious cat-like figure.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Jun&#039;ichi seems like your typical male student, who happens to live with his adopted sister, except that he seems to be overly-popular with the other gender. As in many animes, the parents are always out. The anime does a good job at showing how difficult it can be to express one&#039;s innermost feelings as it takes over half the series for Jun&#039;ichi to finally admit his true feelings.<br />
<br />
Nemu is a love/hate character. She seems strong on the outside but is actually quite frail on the inside and will often be seen running away from her problems. However, her brother always takes care of her to make up for her weakness.<br />
<br />
Sakura is probably the most mysterious character during the first half of the anime. She is much more resolute in her goal to become Jun&#039;ichi&#039;s lover and will openly display affection for him. Luckily, most of the mysteries surrounding her are answered in the later part of the anime.<br />
<br />
Overall, each character&#039;s development is well done and is given a proper conclusion.<br />
<br />
Value:<br />
This was one of the earlier harems that I had watched, and one that I still remember to date. Re-watch value is pretty high if you&#039;re into the romance aspect, as development goes quite a good deal further than a lot of more current harems. I found the drama near the end very intense and ended up watching certain episodes multiple times. For me, this was one of the most enjoyable harems that I&#039;ve watched.

    Alright, I&#039;ll keep this review short.  First off, the story line was good, the artwork, although skillfully done to some degree was held back by the sound quality or lack thereof.  Also, the plot lacked character development, as one of the former reviewers has previously mentioned.  As far as I am concerned, I was only able to enjoy the first couple of minutes before the plot started going downhill.<br />
<br />
In short, I didn&#039;t enjoy it at all.
