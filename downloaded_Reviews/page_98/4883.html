    Before watching this anime I thought to myself, &quot;This is probably one of those harems ecchi shows where a lot of girls fall for the same guy.&quot; Well it was almost that. <br />

Instead of a lot of girls there was only two, Ibuki Ikaruga and Ayame Ikaruga. They fall in love with Yoichi Karasuma. But unlike many harems this anime has a credible storyline. Unknowingly Ibuki has a fiance. After many years he has finally come to wed his belowed. That&#039;s basically the jist of it. Yoichi and the girls try to overcome obstacles and challenges that are thrown at them.<br />
<br />
AIC is known for creating

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14160">
        some of the best animation in the anime world and they don&#039;t disappoint with Asu no Yoichi. Color, character design and background are all animated really well. One of the bright spots in this anime is &quot;Washizu visions&quot; and &quot;Tsubasa visions.&quot; These are &quot;visions&quot; the respective character has funny visions of what he or she believes will happen.<br />
<br />
Every character plays a part in Asu no Yoichi. There isn&#039;t a lot of character development but interaction between each character is huge. They all have a special moment with each other. Secondary characters such as Washizu also play a big part in the anime. They all have a big part during the last few episodes.<br />
<br />
There are many golden comedy moments in this anime. They all contribute to the enjoyment level of this anime. Asu no Yoichi is enjoyable and fun to watch. On the other hand it doesn&#039;t have many epic moments that will make you remember this anime. If you have the time this you should check this anime out.<br />

    Asu no Yoichi is an average anime that lacks a lot to be good so don&#039;t watch it but if you want to, go ahead read what you&#039;re getting into.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
It&#039;s a Harem/Ecchi anime so you shouldn&#039;t expect anything special from this, the story is about Yoichi an overpowered samurai (but that makes sense because he spent his whole life training to be the best samurai), a samurai that wants to expand his knowledge on other abilities that he doesn&#039;t know so his father sends him to a Dojo that specializes in the same ability (really?), he wants to see if they can teach him something

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195162">
        new, he gets a Harem of sisters where 2 of them are interested in him, the problem is that he has no social skills whatsoever so he doesn&#039;t know how to behave to the situations he or the sisters puts him into, in the way they stumble upon other people from other Dojos with different abilities and kick their butts, and that&#039;s it, the story is just average.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Sound<br />
The art is good, could have been better, but it was well animated but not smooth.<br />
The sound was good, the music and voice acting were good.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
The character development was ok, i liked only one of the sisters, Ayame, i also really liked Washizu he was hilarious with Torigaya who in every episode gets smaller and smaller (and only in the manga you will know the reason behind this apparently) every other character was just average but Yoichi was my least favorite, he was too naive.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
I really liked a lot the comedy Washizu and Torigaya had to offer, but they appeared from time to time so it was less enyojable, Washizu was the <br />
best character (which didn&#039;t appear a lot) and i liked Ayame too, which makes them the best part of the anime, also the weak ending didn&#039;t help, it&#039;s an average anime.

    First review I’ve done-<br />
<br />
It doesn’t matter significantly of what others think about a particular anime. Everyone has their own taste, so in general, a review should be based purely on what you thought about it. Prior to watching Asu no Yoichi!I did a little research on it and came to the conclusion that it’s a harem anime. New to this kind of genre, I took the liberty of trying it and at the end I really enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
Asu no Yoichi! Is about a 17 year old samurai who has lived in a rural area for most of his life along with his father and some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review103061">
        animals to company him. One day his father asks him to move to the city as he can’t make him stronger and also for experience. He seizes this opportunity and starts living with 4 sisters to assist him with his training. Throughout the show the protagonist of the story Yoichi along with his acquaintances, embark on various tasks that need addressing.<br />
<br />
Storyline- 5/10<br />
The anime lacked a strong plot, it basically went like this-<br />
Boy living in the mountains-moves to the city-has to survive in the city-train in the city-save some of his friends from enemies that aren’t even portrayed as strong compared to him. In between all this, there is plenty of romance as well as humor to keep you glued into watching it. <br />
Asu no Yoichi doesn’t really have a strong storyline, its basically a bunch of short scenarios put together to form the first season.<br />
 Also it felt as if it was a little rushed towards the end but it also leaves an opening for a second season. <br />
<br />
art-8/10<br />
The art was done pretty well and the company who made the show are used to producing shows with good quality art.<br />
<br />
Sound- 8/10<br />
Nice selection of music for each moment. Can’t really emphasize enough for this area, as you wouldn’t tend to pay much attention to it.  That said, the intro music and the end sounded all right.<br />
<br />
Character-6/10<br />
There wasn’t much character development throughout the series. However, there was at least an episode dedicated to the main characters that explored them more thoroughly and there is a bit of interaction between one another. Also Yoichi was overpowered and unlike other typical ecchi harem anime’s, this one only has roughly 3 girls that are attracted to the protagonist.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-9/10<br />
Loved it so much that I practically finished it within 24 hours. What I liked the most about Asu no Yoichi! Was the humor, throughout the episodes, there is plenty of it. <br />
<br />
Overall-7/10<br />
It’s really an anime in which you can sit back and relax too offering you some enjoyable entertainment and isn’t meant to be too serious. <br />

    Im going to start off on a bad note because i feel that this mini series lacked a plot and has a pathetic excuse for one. HOWEVER this anime wasnt particularly bad unless you actually found the plot interesting(like i did) only to be disappointed that it was just to make the synopsis look pretty.<br />
<br />
The one thing i did enjoy the most were the characters. Each character of the ikaruga household were unique and was interesting to watch the character development of each individual in the earlier episodes. A definite reason as to why i continued to watch this anime...<br />
<br />
The comedy wasnt all as good

          <span style="display: none;" id="review13548">
        as it should be considering this story had little plot and a rushed climax. The &quot;accidental&quot; breast groping incidents were just not funny after the first and second time and the material was recycled countless times making this series not as enjoyable as it should have been. Overall it was average.

    Asu no Yoichi, as described on this page, is about a samurai boy who was sent down the mountain by his father to live with four girls in a modern-day, Japanese city. The premise basically is another set-up for a harem anime, although three beautiful girls plus a cute younger sister is relatively small compared to traditional anime harems. <br />
<br />
The overall story is more of a series of short scenarios, simple events in the characters&#039; &amp;quot;everyday lives&amp;quot; more meant for humor than anything serious. So far, the mini-stories have been resolved quickly and simply- no truly deep or touching moments, but nevertheless somewhat vaguely heartwarming.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review12003">
        And also, there is a lot of harem humor going on- the usual &amp;quot;accidental&amp;quot; groping of breasts and other awkward encounters. Maybe the story will start to get deeper later into the series; however, this sort of approach really doesn&#039;t sit well with such a short (12-ep) series. <br />
<br />
The art is alright; nothing to really write home about. I like the hairstyles of Chihaya and Ayame a lot. The fight scenes are typical whoosh lines and wind that can be found in most other anime; again, it&#039;s nothing special. The &amp;quot;Washizu vision&amp;quot; scenes didn&#039;t catch my interest that much either. Music is usually upbeat and goes along well with the dialogue.<br />
<br />
Alright, what really bothered me was that the sisters all have different hair colors. I know a lot of anime does this, but how do two parents manage to produce such a wide spectrum of hair quality and color? Aside from that, the only character I really like so far is Chihaya. The others are generic; the gallant yet nosebleed-prone male protagonist, the clumsy tsundere, the talented yet violent girl, the innocent sister always needing to be saved.<br />
<br />
Overall the show is alright if you like something lighthearted, with classic but overused harem-style gags. The majority of the cast consists of overdone anime stereotypes, but the artwork and character design is almost decent enough to overcome some of that handicap. Even so, the story is relatively simple and shallow. I&#039;ve only seen four episodes (1/3 of the series), but from the way this is going, I can only give it a 6 and pray for more screentime for Chihaya.

    I first read the manga and found it to be good. I looked forward to Asu no Yoichi! the anime, and after all 12 episodes, it met my expectations.<br />
<br />
Asu no Yoichi! is a comedy, harem about a teen samurai who has lived his entire life in the mountains with his father. He goes off to live in the city and stays at the Ikaruga house, ran by four sisters. With this setup, hilarity ensues, which is the main form of entertainment in Asu no Yoichi!.<br />
<br />
The story consists of episodic events involving Yoichi, the Ikaruga sisters, and masked figures who apparently wants Yoichi dead, sending assassin

          <span style="display: none;" id="review13881">
        after another to finish him off. These attacks are part of the main story, which is really quite unimportant, and the writers only use it to end the anime with a satisfactory conclusion. The lov.. eer, &quot;crush&quot; circles in Asu no Yoichi! is also very funny, leading often into hilarious misunderstandings and situations.<br />
<br />
The art is quite average, and I don&#039;t see much to comment about. There are &quot;Washizu visions&quot; and &quot;Tsubasa visions&quot; in the anime, where the respective characters daydream about their crush in favorable situations. Here, the artist deploys hilarious art styles in drawing people in the vision to show the character&#039;s mental attitude toward such people. It&#039;ll definitely bring about some laughter the first time around :)<br />
<br />
Each character has his or her part in Asu no Yoichi!, and interacted with each other to create funny scenes that were enjoyable to watch. There is little development within the characters, but as a comedy, that&#039;s not quite important. Needless to say, the characters were pretty well done.<br />
<br />
Asu no Yoichi! was pretty enjoyable. It doesn&#039;t have any exception aspect that makes it stand out. Overall, it&#039;s quite average, but its something that&#039;s worth your while to watch.<br />
<br />

    The protagonist of the series is Karasuma Yoichi, a boy of 17 years who lived their whole lives in the mountains with his father to improve his technique for the sword. One day, Yoichi decided to go to town after his father said it was not possible to get stronger in this condition. By stepping on the town, Yoichi meets a girl of Ikaruga dojo and is received as a guest at the dojo, along with four living sisters Ikaruga.<br />
<br />
History 8/10<br />
A simple story made better .. Nothing unusual, a samurai who went to town for the first time and gets into a jam right away,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27391">
        but shows its good side right away<br />
<br />
Art 8/10<br />
The art ranges where the anime goes the chapters ... the city with its buildings and malls and the mountain where he has trained well done graphics, there is weak<br />
<br />
Sound 8/10<br />
The music for the opening and closing of the anime are well made demonstrating what is series, and music background also shows clearly what is happening without sinning in any way<br />
<br />
Character 8/10<br />
Well done characters each with their own way ... the main one shows the naivete of someone who does not know the city and the Sisters of the dojo also show his feminine side and their internal disputes in &#039;love&#039;<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9/10<br />
comedy rose well to note anime with funny scenes and helping ECHI series and its theme itself ... do not let us down and pulls a good laugh<br />
<br />
Overall 7/10<br />
With graphics, sound, history and good fun in the series was level at all pleasant to watch mainly for the sisters and by way of the samurai<br />
only missed a few fights in the best level since it&#039;s an anime samurai<br />
<br />

    Story:<br />
The story revolves around a samurai named Yoichi Karasuma who has lived in the mountains for all his life. After learning everything his father could teach him, he was sent to a dojo in the city. Surprise surprise, the dojo is the home of 4 girls. Now how will Yoichi survive as he tries to adjust to living with 4 girls in a world he&#039;s been secluded from his entire life. <br />
<br />
Even with a full title like Samurai Harem: Asu no Yoichi, it still had the potential to be a satisfying romance despite the rampant amount of cliches. Unfortunately, it was not satisfying, but it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review171847">
        was indeed beyond cliche. <br />
<br />
With a plot like that, it wouldn&#039;t be hard to think of it as the samurai counter-part of Full Metal Panic. Sadly, Asu no Yoichi did just not produce the same quality as FMP. Unlike FMP, it barely utilizes the fact that the protagonist has never lived in such a world. The protagonist could&#039;ve had moments of not understanding how certain technology worked rather than looking like a total chuuni &amp; pervert. Instead, the plot decided to follow the generic harem sequence:<br />
MC falls -&gt; perverted situation -&gt; Girl hits MC (Even though he&#039;s a samurai for crying out loud) -&gt; Both girl and MC feel bad -&gt; They reconcile -&gt; rinse &amp; repeat<br />
<br />
This is basically the whole show, it hardly ever diverges from that pattern. There are some cool moments of Yoichi here and there, but they&#039;re definitely not going to be making up for anything any time soon. They also try to put in some back-story and what not, but they never do it any justice because in the end, it&#039;s back to the harem sequence.<br />
<br />
In short, it had a not so original plot that they could&#039;ve still used for a satisfying romance, but it went full cliche and generic. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art is the best thing about the show. It may not be absolutely stunning, but in comparison to the other aspects, it&#039;s pretty good. Not to mention the heroines are appealing which is a pretty big part of the harem genre. I&#039;m glad the characters at least look nice.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
In all honesty, I watched this show quite a long time ago, so I can&#039;t recall the OP or ED. However, if either were truly amazing, I&#039;m sure I would&#039;ve remembered it. <br />
<br />
Character:<br />
The characters are just as weak as the plot, possibly even weaker. All the characters fit into some commonly used trope. We have the protagonist, Yoichi Karasuma, a spineless samurai. He&#039;s a master of the sword, but for some reason lets girls push him around. While it is a possibility that it&#039;s in his code of honor to take the beatings, there&#039;s still a limit to how violent a girl is allowed to be. Speaking of violent females, we have the female protagonist, Ibuki Ikaruga. She&#039;s nice to look at and is a complete sweetheart to everyone. Well everyone except Yoichi. Like most harem girls, she believes in expressing her love through violence. At first it wasn&#039;t that bad, but you know her love increases and so does the eventual insufferable beatings. They really try to make you sympathize with her, but it&#039;s extremely difficult, considering she beats Yoichi for a good portion of the series. Sorry to say, but I&#039;m not going to go in-depth with the rest of the characters. I&#039;ll just say we have another tsundere, your flirtatious heroine, a buxom elementary school student, and a delinquent who likes the main heroine and thinks he can save her from the clutches of Yoichi (This is a harem so misunderstandings are everywhere).    The main 2 characters alone should be enough to decide whether you want to watch it or not. <br />
<br />
Overall: <br />
I can only think of a few reasons as to why, you would want to watch this.<br />
1. The main heroine suits your taste in terms of appearance.<br />
2. You&#039;ve seen every other harem show.<br />
3. You&#039;ve seen every other anime.<br />
4. You&#039;re a masochist.<br />
5. You have absolutely no expectations and just watch anime for the fun of it.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, there are way better harem anime out there. Trust me, this show is only going to make you rage at it&#039;s excessive use of misunderstandings. perverted situations, and tsundere tendencies. To top it all off, the show is not romantically conclusive, so you&#039;re surely to be disappointed and angry. <br />

    To start off this show trys to embody way to many genres, and comes off being all over the place allot of the time for the sheer number of fan groups it&#039;s trying to please. Harem, action, comedy, drama and romance all try to take centre stage at various points. Action and drama both come off as really half assed, but the comedy does provide allot of genuinely funny moments, and as a harem it&#039;s definitely among the more likeable shows.<br />
<br />
The story unsurprisingly has been highly episodic, and i&#039;m going to throw in a spoiler here, they have a hot spring episode! who&#039;d have guessed.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review13406">
        The relationships with the characters has slowly developed a bit, and we&#039;ve had a great many villain of the week&#039;s thrown in for the action element of the show, which i can&#039;t emphasise enough, is not this shows strongest point, think team rocket in pokemon and your on roughly the right lines.<br />
<br />
The art and character models are perhaps a little underwhelming for a 2009 anime but nothing to put you off enjoying the show, the sound is basically the same, i felt the opening was above average, aside from that i&#039;ve barely noticed the music at all, so no strong impressions left.<br />
<br />
The characters in this show are a mixed bag, firstly the two leads and main pairing Yoichi and Ikaruga are as standard as characters come, and add very little to the show, that&#039;s not to say there dislikeable characters, but you&#039;ve most likely come across them many times with a slightly different appearance.<br />
<br />
The supporting cast is truly this shows strong point, Chihaya, Ayame, and Ryou really add so much more to this show, they&#039;re genuinely amusing characters and add something different to the standard formula with their distinct and likeable personalities. Ayame and Ryou also add to the romance aspect both providing a rival for the opposite leads affections and both are loveable underdogs and highly entertaining in this role. This is without mentioning the other supporting cast members who all contribute something to the general shenanigans.<br />
<br />
If your looking for an easy watch this is an excellent show to pick up,  it trys to be allot of things, but ultimately is allot of fun, and succeeds as a harem-esk comedy.<br />

    To tell the truth i didn&#039;t think i will enjoy this as much i did.At first i think this will be boring,and i will probably drop it at first two episodes,but i was wrong.I liked this anime a lot,don&#039;t get me wrong it wasn&#039;t perfect,but if you like funny anime to kill some time i would recommend this one.Characters are great,and funny.But if you want some great marshal arts and fights this one is not for you.You would be just fine if you would watch one episode per night to get some laughs before going to sleep.And if you like anime I would also recommend

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279831">
        to read manga,in my opinion it is little better that anime.<br />

    From the synopsis I think I know what you&#039;re expecting. Yes. It&#039;s your typical martial-arts love-comedy.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t have to turn on my brain while watching this. It&#039;s pretty much your average and inoffensive shounen anime served in an average and inoffensive way. Perfect after a tiring day at school or at work.<br />
<br />
On to the review:<br />
<br />
Episodic almost throughout the whole 12 episodes. It doesn&#039;t try to be groundbreaking nor does it try to be &quot;deep&quot;. However on what it did not try, it succeeded on making the anime fun. Let&#039;s face it, there are times that everyone would simply want to sit back, turn off their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review13603">
        brains, and enjoy the show. That&#039;s how this anime is.<br />
<br />
The production quality is average as a whole. Character designs are formulaic shounen style with cute and sexy girls, and wimpy, pretty boy, or brute looking guys. Typical you&#039;ve &quot;seen one, seen them all&quot;.<br />
<br />
I can recommend this anime if you&#039;re looking for some shallow yet enjoyable entertainment. Most anime of the same genre can&#039;t provide those two important elements at the same time nowadays.

    So yes i might be parsing this a good bit for the rating im gonna give it but yeah lets get into it<br />
<br />
Story: so the story pretty much starts with Yoichi who has been training for 17 years now that hes learned so much he hasn&#039;t had the time too really see the city and also doesn&#039;t now anything about the outside world pre say so his father sends him down too see the Ikaruga sisters to learn but too also get to know the world rather than that other people want too take him out<br />
<br />
Art: art was very good nothing bad about it<br />
<br />
Sound: same

          <span style="display: none;" id="review234526">
        as art it was very good<br />
<br />
Character: Yoichi is a pretty decent guy he does end up getting into situation with all the girls but hes not a perv so yeah but hes a kind and nice main character. Ibuki is a pretty nice and also clam girl she likes the main person Yoichi. Kagome is basically the little sister of the anime shes sweat and nice little girl honestly that&#039;s all too say about her. Chihaya shes basically the same as Ibuki but shes a manga artist. Ayame is different from the other girls when ever she thinks about Yoichi she tends to get flustered and what not she basically the tsundere of the anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: now i hella enjoyed this the comedy was pure gold for me cause of the situation that Yoichi would get in with the girls also the action was actually pretty good aswell also there is no harem if anything only Ibuki and Ayame like him<br />
<br />
Overall: giving this a 9 i know its a little high for some people but for me its right for it cause it had everything for me freaking funny comedy and also that the action was good aswell

    Asu no Yoichi! is no typical samuri show. It has action like most samuri shows the enemies are always different and wierd. Plus the different types adds the goodness.<br />
               The fact that this show is comedy+ecchi+harem. How could you resist. The overall plot is good and like all good shows there are no cliffhangers on the last episode. Asu no Yoichi has a great shoujo feel along with a shouen touch! You&#039;ll never get bored of this show!

    Asu no Yoichi! is surprisingly unwatchable. While not an absolutely terrible anime, there’s just simply nothing special about it at all. None of the characters in the show are memorable, the action is boring, the plot is predictable and even the fanservice is disappointing. I have to question the director’s decision to animate this show in the first place; after watching all twelve episodes, I had to ask myself, “So what? Why do I care about any of this?”<br />
<br />
And frankly, I couldn’t find an answer. I simply could not bring myself to care about any of the characters in the show. Scripting and plot are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186445">
        definitely to blame for this, as the seiyuu do a pretty good job of attempting to bring out character. Yet, how does one extract personality from a cardboard cutout? The characters are absolutely flat and act in a manner that is insultingly predictable. Yoichi, as the hero of a harem anime, is perverted and clueless; Ibuki, the master of the Dojo, is the stereotypical busty family matriarch… the list goes on and on. The creators put absolutely no thought into the motivations and aspirations of the main cast, and the result is absolute disaster.<br />
<br />
Not satisfied with the lack of character development in the main cast, the creators have chosen to present Asu no Yoichi! in “villian of the week” format. This leads to antagonists frequently being replaced, and causes a lack of continuity between each episode. There does exist an overarching meta-plot that drives the series, but its premise is so ludicrous and its resolution so predictable that the series could have done without it.<br />
<br />
In addition, the fanservice and the comedy are both flops. Absolutely no decent fanservice occurs throughout the entire show; weak attempts at accidental boob-grabs (as is common in all harem shows) are made, but the results are rather painful to watch and seldomly amusing. Most of the humor in this show falls flat on its face; I found myself groaning in disgust more than laughing.<br />
<br />
All in all, this show suffers from only one major (yet damning) problem: poor, poor writing. It’s clear that the writers did not attempt to create any sort of unique character for each member of the cast, and the show suffers accordingly. Couple a cast with as much personality as drying paint with a highly repetitive plot and uninspiring humor… and you have the disaster that is this anime.

    明日のよいち! Asu no Yoichi - Samurai Harem, so the English title, an old-school comedy that literally pours harem RomCom clichés on the audience. Fun and entertainment for those who do not mind a lavish fan service and who enjoy laughing at the awkward hero who is always beaten-up by the girl(s). If you can&#039;t find anything to laugh at in the first episode, then this series is not for you.<br />
<br />
Story: Excessive fan service, really thin plot, but the basic concept has enough twists to be entertaining (5/10)<br />
Karasuma-san taught his son all his knowledge about disciplines of the Divine Wind technique, and eventually Yoichi became better

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321097">
        than his father. For this reason, his father decided to send Yoichi to the Ikaruga family dojo, where he should gain new experiences and further develop his sword technique. What Daddy Karasuma did not and could not know that the parents left the Dojo Ikaruga to their daughters. So Yoichi was sent from the wild to the urban jungle. On top of that, he stumbles into a women&#039;s domain, which becomes a challenge because he is not familiar with having girls around. The story has enough twist, the comedy is entertaining despite the heavy use of fan service, and a small plus in my opinion is that Yoichi is not the typical zero hero. He knows how to use the katana, which makes the fights worth seeing. One can criticize that the plot contains hardly any surprises, but nothing was really done wrong with the implementation of the genre-typical fracases.<br />
<br />
Characters: seems a bit like the Who&#039;s Who of an Ero game, but in a funny way (5/10)<br />
All characters are sympathetic, even the antagonists. The studio AIC already has experience with this genre (Girls Bravo, Seto no Hanayome etc.). That the cast, with other well-known genre representatives such as Love Hina has a high recognition value is therefore not surprising.<br />
Even though the female characters seem to be derived from an Ero-game and occasionally clothes do vanish in thin air, it does not exceed the limits of aesthetics. Characters and their actions remain aesthetic, never neglecting the fun, so the series retains its comical tone.<br />
Karasuma Yoichi: <br />
Yoichi was trained only in combat, when he is sent to the town, he drops a brick at a time and literally drowns in embarrassing mistakes as the four girls enter the scene. As clumsy as he is in interpersonal matters with the girls, he&#039;s no ordinary Roncom Zero Hero. With his Bokken, he can defend himself and others well and because of his friendly, honest nature, he quickly gains friends.<br />
Ikaruga Ibuki:<br />
As the oldest of the sisters, she accepted her fate and took over the management of the dojo, which gives her character a caring severity. Similar to Kagome, the smallest of the four sisters, the character builds on a strong stereotype. Unfortunately, in contrast to the manga, the character in the anime can not detach itself from the stereotype.<br />
Ikaruga Ayame: <br />
She is probably the one with the most real conflict. She always feels in second place behind her big sister, no matter how hard she tries. I really like the realistic depiction of the conflict. Because of self-doubt, unable to be satisfied with her own personality. Beautifully portrayed how a sincere and warm appreciation awakens her self-confidence, so that slowly the self-doubt vanish and she regains the joie-de-vivre.<br />
Ikaruga Chihaya:<br />
The cheeky middle school girl is already Manga-ka, she is intellectually educatedand and never misses an opportunity to pull Yoichi`s leg, but looks as if she couldn&#039;t hurt a fly but she`s a sly one. On the other hand, she isn&#039;t completely uninterested in the principled Yoichi either, but she deals with her feelings in a sophisticated way.<br />
Ikaruga Kagome:<br />
Kagome is the youngest of the Ikaruga family and a primary school pupil. She has a shy personality, but masters the housework and especially cooking for a 10 year old student, exceptionally well. She is still a bit clumsy, but has a very considerate personality and loves her sisters very much. A cute and adorable little sister.<br />
Washizu Ryo<br />
Simply &quot;Wa-san&quot; is trained in boxing and a notorious street fighter. In the anime, his fighting style was changed, he used iron knuckles in the fight with Yoichi, in manga, however, he has used blades. His transformation from a loner to a member of the Ikaruga Dojo class is a compelling and interesting part of the otherwise more comedy-driven series. But is not deepened further, not even in the manga. There was potential, but it would not have fit into the frame of the series without being out of place.<br />
<br />
Visuals: simple but good drawing style, convincing animation, a bit too much Chibi (7/10)<br />
The visual presentation may not be extraordinary, but the implementation by Studio Anime International Company (AIC) clearly demonstrates the effort to create a visually appealing anime. The character designs of the female cast may not be extravagant, but they are varied and well done. Compared to other series, it is also noticeable that the male actors have also received an appealing design and not just the protagonist. The drawing style is realistic, but slightly different from the original illustrations by Minamoto Yū. The character design adapted by Morishima Noriko for the anime is well done, especially Ibuki and Yoichi look more mature and Ryou has a more appealing, yet cool, gruff design. The depth of detail is not that high, but that&#039;s not untypical of the genre mix. Overall, the animation for 2009 is slightly above the average of such a series. The characters are well implemented and convincing. Another plus are the colorful, beautiful and slightly blurred backgrounds as well as the convincing use of light and shadow effects, so that the animation presents itself very appealingly. The shades, such as the hair, are harmonious and the facial expressions are appealing in emotional moments and can convey the mood of the character. One can criticize that everything is a little simple, but simply is not synonymous with bad.<br />
Unfortunately, the overall picture is affected by the increased use of Chibi effects. These are very suitable at first, but are used too often and the quality of the implementation also decreases, so that the effect continues to be lost in the course of the series. This does not affect the entertainment value of the comedy, but reduces the overall picture. The project that was directed by Rino Kujo has deliberately deviated from the original and in many ways for the better. The fan service is very present and bondage clothing is certainly not for everyone but the limit of aesthetics is not exceeded. It is less than in manga and in direct comparison with e.g. &quot;To Love Ru&quot; rather harmless.<br />
<br />
Sounds: simple but suitable, VA good and likeable (6/10)<br />
The soundtrack was composed by Kikuya Tomoki and surprised me. In the series, the BGM doesn&#039;t stand out very much, but it fits well to the scenes. The soundtrack consists of several different musical arrangements, which present themselves well on the level of the series. <br />
The OP &quot;Egao no Riyuu&quot; by Meg Rock, is soft rock and nice to hear. The animation is basically not bad but the intro entrance through the gate and to the buildings is a bit too clear with the CG elements. In the further course, the drawn character designs come to the fore again, so it fits overall.<br />
The ED is &quot;Life and Proud&quot; by Misato Aki, starts a bit calmer, more romantic and then has a nice, optimistic ending. I really liked music and animation. A sweet detail is the variation of ED in the last episode. A barely perceptible variant, but I liked it.<br />
Among the voice actors I especially liked the voice of Ibuki, which was spoken by Satou Rina. Her voice has a beautiful feminine, soft sound and in the arguments her voice was pleasantly clear. The choice of Tamura Yukari, with that certain lascivious touch in her voice, as the synchronization of the sly Chihaya, fits perfectly. I also liked the performance of Okamoto Nobuhiko as Yoichi&#039;s voice very much. In particular, his presentation of a samurai with the appropriate language and idiom was successful.<br />
<br />
All in all, you&#039;ve come to the right place if you&#039;re looking for a fun Romcom series with only 12 episodes. At first I thought that it was odd to write a review for a show that is already ten years old because the focus is usually more on current titles. But like the review of the manga &quot;11eyes - Tsumi to Batsu to Aganai no Shoujo&quot; a few months ago, an old series made me curious again. Asu no Yoichi is a little above average, unforgettable and pleasant. Those who like &quot;Asu no Yoichi&quot; could also be interested in &quot;To love Ru&quot; or &quot;Shijou Saikyou no Deshi Kenichi&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading and have fun watching.

    Summary: This anime was pretty good for the harem/fighting/ecchi genre. It is PG-13 so it doesn&#039;t go over the top like others and instead is more character and plot driven. The story wasn&#039;t too complex, the characters mostly fit into tropes and a lot of the comedy and plot line were pretty standard to the genre, but it did everything well enough and felt like a good addition. I specifically liked the character models even if they weren&#039;t anything special. <br />
<br />
I view this as a good preview into the universe to help the viewer decide if they like the story enough to read the manga,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review210225">
        which I did. I also think it is good as a stand alone story, and ends without any major cliff hangers. Overall if you&#039;re looking for a new anime in the genre you might want to give this a try.<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
The story was pretty typical. Guy comes from the mountains and lives in a dojo with girls. There are a bunch of silly love interest plots (it was refreshing not every girl had a crush on him), there are some fights with random bad guys but mostly just silliness and trope filled comedy.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
The art was done well. I really enjoyed the character models, the characters were unique and I liked the illustrations, they definitely enhanced the experience.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
It was descent. Nothing memorable but it got the job done.<br />
<br />
Character: 6/10<br />
This is the weaker element of the story. Most of the characters and their development are straight down trope lines. Granted some of them get a bit of evolution but it all felt too convenient. You know that thing where bad guys learn the error of their ways in 30 seconds? Yeah that happens... a bunch. <br />
<br />
As far as the tropes: Slightly pervy guy who always ends up accidentally grabbing a girl&#039;s chest, Tsundere, shy girl, loli girl, aloof not interested girl, girl who has huge breasts, girl who has small breasts and mentions it often, super tough guy who is really weak and his clingy best friend. Nailed it!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
I enjoyed it for what it was, a trope filled pretty standard harem/ecchi/fighting anime.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7/10<br />
It&#039;s good for what it is. It isn&#039;t venturing outside the box or winning any awards, but what it does it does just fine. There is enough uniqueness to the plot to make it worth watching. The characters follow tropes but also have enough unique points to make them interesting in their own way. At a minimum, it convinced me to give the manga a try, which I think was likely the entire point of this anime... so mission accomplished!<br />

    Asu no Yoichi, seeing the ecchi/romance tags, I went into this expecting a fine balance of a shounen, martial arts setting and some romance infused with some fan service ecchi. I&#039;m sorry to say that near the end, it failed to fully satisfy me. <br />

Story: 6<br />
Art:8<br />
Sound:6<br />
Character:6<br />
Enjoyment:6<br />
Overall:6<br />
<br />
Story: The story to Asu no Yoichi is mainly focused on the interactions between the characters, but also since the anime included a shounen aspect, it had the action focus as well. The balance between the two however wasn&#039;t exactly up to par in my standards. With the setting A.N.Y. gave, it could have turned out much better,but had a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review106427">
        lot of wasted potential due to the overall lack of flow the story had. A main plot line was obviously given from the shounen theme, but hardly followed, and easily discarded. This doesn&#039;t mean the story was bad, it may be that I have watched too many of similarly themed anime and have found too many that are superior to this one, but, the main problems I found with the story is the lack of overall flow from episode to episode. Meaning a main purpose that connects them. The anime went from a young 17 year old samurai trying to adapt in a completely new atmosphere, to just constant accidental breast grabs, and a sorry attempt at romance. The plot development is another problem; almost none is seen during the middle of the story which is when the cast of characters go about to do things very common in ecchi/harem anime like hot-springs and festivals, but when the story is given a main goal the development of it seems rushed and cliche. To sum up, the story in my experience could have been better, but Asu no Yoichi is a good anime to start out with. <br />
<br />
Art: The art was pretty good, the flow of pictures was well done, and I found barely any problems with it. The main thing I focus on would be the quality of the anime, which wasn&#039;t too bad, to the flow of the pictures. In both of these aspects, Asu no Yoichi didn&#039;t fail. <br />
Regarding the fan service that Asu no Yoichi provided, at first it was included to add comedic effect, but the anime never tried anything different. The fan service was just the same stuff over and over in each episode; after the repetition of the same thing, it got really old and borderline annoying. Almost on par with the To Love Ru franchise. <br />
<br />
The Sound: The sound wasn&#039;t very good in my opinion. It reminded me of Korean dramas since Asu no Yoichi and most Korean dramas only play about 5 songs, but a billion times. Regarding the OST, it was similarly repeated as the lack of originality in the fan service region. The songs themselves weren&#039;t bad, but after hearing the same action song over and over, it gets boring and loses the added effect that is to come from accompanying the scene. <br />
<br />
Characters: The main character didn&#039;t necessarily seem like a typical main character. IMO Yoichi didn&#039;t really stand out from the anime, nor did he have a big affect on it. The only dramatic feature Yoichi had was his adaptation to the new society. His attitude/personality/goals never showed an ulterior goal, thus making him pretty much a static character. The other supporting characters were either infatuated with one of the three following characters. Ibuki Ikaruga, Yoichi Karasuma, and Ryou Washizu. The romance deveopment between each of the supporting characters and either of those three were poorly done and showed hardly if any progress. I&#039;ll also have to input that the overall obsessive personality Ukyou Saginomiya put off was just too much. His personality pretty much was repulsive and seemed out of pace with the rest of the story. Bringing up the fan service aspect again, the main character&#039;s &quot;Careless&quot; breast grabs followed up by a beating from his fellow female characters was just too repetitive and got old. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment and Overall: The main problems I had with Asu no Yoichi! were: the flow and development of the story, the OST&#039;s lack of diversity, the repetitive fan service, and some of the character&#039;s personalities. Other than these things, I think that it is just that I have seen too many anime like this and Asu no Yoichi failed to stand out. So with that, I have to say, if you have seen anime such as To Love Ru, Princess Lover!, Ichiban Ushiro no Daimou!, Rosario + Vampire, and IS: Infinite Stratos, you might want to skip out on watching this one. However if you are relatively knew to the genre, or anime in general this is a good starting plate. The overall story,characters, art and sound weren&#039;t bad or awful in any way; it&#039;s just that the anime lacked flow and originality. Giving this anime a &quot;Fair 6&quot;. <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading,<br />

    This review will be short. This anime was entertaining but ultimately left zero impact on me. I will never watch this again, never talk about it again and I think that is the show&#039;s biggest issue. It isn&#039;t that the show was bad, it wasn&#039;t... but for all the elements that the show got right, it seems to use some of them incorrectly. There is also no resolution for any of the established romances. None. Not a kiss, hug, confession, nothing... from anyone. I was expecting more all around TBH. Loved the premise, loved some of the characters but the execution of pacing and story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review137123">
        left much to be desired.<br />
<br />
Story: 4/10 - Packed with potential, ultimately it doesn&#039;t deliver on what could have made it a must see anime. As it stands, its not bad... just very forgettable. <br />
<br />
ART: 7/10 - Good solid animation but nothing that I would write home about. <br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10 - I really liked the opening theme. I don&#039;t know how appropriate it was to the theme of the show but I can&#039;t complain. Very nice.<br />
<br />
Character: 7/10 - I liked the characters in this one... though the main female was totally wrong for her type. She is oddly violent for the established &quot;mother figure&quot; character. I would have pegged the blonde sister to be more violent when those awkward situations arose. I can&#039;t help being a sucker for Kagome, who is just so cute and fills the &quot;Shinobu&quot; class as I call it... the quiet, shy, sweet girl who is good with domestic stuff.<br />
<br />
Overall: While I liked this and don&#039;t have anything overly bad to say about it. It lacks a few elements which could have made it so much more. Virtus Signum gives this show a 6/10. Decent.

    &#039;Asu no Yoichi&#039; is an enjoyable anime, unique in that it takes its time when it comes to character development or storyline progression and rather focuses on the main character - Yoichi Karasuma. In fact, despite the &#039;Ecchi&#039; and &#039;romance&#039; tags there&#039;s about as much ecchi or romance here as you&#039;d find in &#039;death note&#039;. There really are only two female characters here who are somewhat attracted to the male lead and some other male characters but frankly, nothing ever happens. Do not expect this to be one of those &quot;male lead chooses this girl in the end&quot; animes. It isn&#039;t. <br />
<br />
That said, it was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review95935">
        enjoyable because of the protagonist &#039;Yoichi&#039;. Ever wondered what would happen if a hardy samurai who trained in the mountains ever since his birth was suddenly pushed into your average modern city and told to live with a bunch of women, all in the hopes of becoming stronger? Well this anime attempts to simulate such scenario with hilarious results as Yoichi is a staunch Bushido adherent and the modern world is... well less pious and based on rather simple principles. Therefore our Samurai more often than not ends up beating people up for a variety of reasons and teaching them how to be more honorable, inside and outside the ring, so to speak. Good stuff. <br />
<br />
Now, there are numerous recurring characters throughout the series, majority of which are of course female. As I mentioned before don&#039;t expect any real romance here because frankly this anime has no direction when it comes to that. We have two guys - Yoichi and Washizu. The girls basically keep switching between those two. One episode Washizu is their savior and Yoichi gets beaten - the next they switch over. Repeat for the entire duration of the series. Whoop de do. As for the female characters themselves, nothing really worth mentioning. Tsundere, shy girl, sly girl... you know the drill. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s the same witch ecchi here&#039;. Of course it&#039;s there but it&#039;s rather sporadic and frankly apart from the obligatory beach episode (every ecchi anime has a beach episode) you don&#039;t really get to see that much. Furthermore it always boils down to Yoichi accidentally stumbling upon an invisible *enter object name here* and grabbing *enter body part name here* and getting mutilated by the girls. <br />
<br />
One other thing that surprised me is that the ending was inconclusive. There is of course a climactic showdown between the samurai and the forces of evil opposing his Bushido ways but after all that work you&#039;d think that he would get some sort of reward or reach a plot-relevant conclusion, however nothing happens. You&#039;re left with a feeling that closely resembles the feeling of getting rejected at a prom. Trust me I speak from experience, it hurts. <br />
<br />
The art and sound are both top notch. The characters are well animated and you can always enjoy the samurai&#039;s ass-kicking in high quality. Likewise the opening and ending is well made and fits in with the series itself.<br />
<br />
All in all, &#039;Asu no Yoichi&#039; is a good anime, nothing more nothing less. Not really high on my re-watch list but it was definitively fun. If anything, watch this for the main character. He will teach you how to become a better person... after kicking your ass.

    Asu no Yoichi is an anime that embodies the harem genre in so many ways. The art and sound are done well while so much lacks in the series for the sake of just selling a few fanservice scenes.<br />
<br />
Story - 6<br />
It starts off with a decent premise. Teen guy has lived and trained in the mountains his entire life as a samurai. He goes to the city to continue his training and stays with a family of 4 girls. While it is sort of a harem, there are only 2 real love interests and there was pretty much zero romantic development in the series. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review116045">
        overarching plot was started earlier on than in many ecchi/harem shows, even of this length, but they left any real development until very late and in the end just failed to change anything from the first episode. The ending was disappointing. Really disappointing. Many anime choose to go with an open end, but few do it this badly.<br />
<br />
Art - 9<br />
No complaints here. I liked most of the art. They clearly put more effort into the art than in the story. I liked most of the character designs, though some of the backgrounds were a bit bland.<br />
<br />
Sound - 9<br />
I enjoyed the voice acting and the OP and ED. I thought they all did very well. It isn&#039;t their fault some of the lines they had to read were laughably bad and most of the voices matched their characters well.<br />
<br />
Character - 6<br />
This one is tough for me. I liked most of the characters. Yoichi and the sisters are all good characters, if a bit cliched. I really dislike many harem leads, but I liked Yoichi even if he was a bit bland and Ibuki was fine, even though they developed her character much less than almost everyone else in the show. Wa-san and his friend, Tsubame and Angela, and some of the other characters were all interesting enough. But there is zero development. One girl is the clear lead from the first episode, but most of the episodes concentrate their energy on other characters. Even with that, there is little to no development in their characters either. Add in one of the more loathsome antagonists and I just can&#039;t give the characters too high a score.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 5<br />
Up until the last few episodes I may have given this a 7 or higher. I enjoy romances. And I enjoy ecchi comedies. This show has its moments. Most of them were pretty early on. But eventually, one would expect there to be some development. And when there isn&#039;t any by the 7-8 episode mark, I have to start to worry about the direction of the show. They kept doing the same jokes over and over again, so after the first few episodes, it started to lose its comedic edge as well. When they started the plot movement in the last few episodes, I was glad that something was finally going to happen. But then they just reverted everything back to the way it was. Absolutely nothing came from it other than introducing the world to an asshole. No romantic development, even with the somewhat complicated web of characters. No feeling of satisfaction from a concluded plot. And no real ending. I guess the last few moments of the show are just about right. Was that perhaps the script he was blowing his nose on?<br />
<br />
Overall, I have to give the show a 6. The art and sound were good and the idea of the show was not too bad. A naive kid coming to the city should make for some interesting moments, and it does, but the flaws of the show are just too big to ignore. I would say it is probably worth a watch for most anime aficionados, but many will be bored with it quickly. Luckily, or unluckily, depending on how you look at it, there are only 12 episodes. Perhaps there would be more development with more episodes, but at least it wont cost you too much time if you don&#039;t enjoy it.
