    In this review, I am including both Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni and Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Kai in my comments. I will be calling the anime simply &amp;quot;Higurashi&amp;quot; in my review to save time. During the few times that I do choose to differenciate between the two seasons, I will refer to &amp;quot;Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Kai&amp;quot; simply as &amp;quot;Kai&amp;quot;.<br />
<br />
Story: Higurashi&#039;s storyline is stellar. It starts off as a horror/thriller anime where numerous mysteries arise in the small town of Hinamizawa. These mysterious storylines are filled with tension and suspense as the viewer fears for Keiichi&#039;s (the main character) life. Since Keiichi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4681">
        is a righteous character who means no harm, the viewer sympathizes with him and fears for his well-being- which is constantly at risk due to the seemingly murderous girls he befriends. Several story arcs arise as we experience Hinamizawa through Keiichi&#039;s eyes. Although these storylines may seem slightly confusing and seemingly unrelated at first, the second season of Higurashi ties them all together extremely well (I won&#039;t say how because of spoilers, of course). This ability to keep the viewer in suspense and tieing so many intriguing stories together makes Higurashi&#039;s storyline extremely engaging, and is my favourite storyline out of every anime I have seen to date. This intricate storyline also carries a heart-warming underlying theme of the importance of friendship and continually shows us extremely hyperbolic possibilities of what the world may become without trust and friendship. I find it particularily interesting that such a theme exists under Higurashi&#039;s superficial hack-and-slash plotline.<br />
<br />
Art: As I read other people&#039;s comments on Higurashi&#039;s art, I noticed that people generally preferred the second season&#039;s artwork more than the first. While the second season&#039;s art did seem more well-rounded and fleshed out that season one, I had no major complaints with the first season&#039;s artwork whatsoever. Both seasons&#039; art tricks most people into believing the anime essentially a typical harem or shoujo. The shock that people recieve when they see such cute characters are actually involved in an intelligent horror/mystery story is priceless. This is the primary reason for which I feel that Higurashi&#039;s artwork is extremely effective.<br />
<br />
Sound: Higurashi&#039;s soundtrack suits the anime extremely well and the only reason I did not give it a 10 is because I cannot remember any specific background music besides Rika&#039;s theme. But just because the soundtrack is not memorable does not necessarily mean it is bad. The undertoned, haunting soundtrack is suited so well to Higurashi that it does not interrupt the flow of the anime&#039;s plot whatsoever. It only increases tension and suspense as haunting melodies are quietly played on a piano or violin in the background. As for opening/ending themes, Higurashi&#039;s openings are extremely catchy and memorable. Both are definitely worth downloading onto an ipod or mp3 player (along with &amp;quot;Dear You&amp;quot;, a song from the original Higurashi videogames). The first ending however, did not do anything for me while Kai&#039;s ending (Taishou.a) was a lot more pleasurable to listen to. I enjoyed it for it&#039;s graceful melody juxtaposed against its rather gruesome lyrics which essentially served as a parallel to highlight the main concept of Higurashi&#039;s storyline. This fact alone made Taishou.a an excellent choice for Kai&#039;s ending song.<br />
<br />
Character: Character development in Higurashi is also amazing. The characters interact with each other in a very natural, human manner and their personalities are not sterotypical in the least. In the first season, Higurashi&#039;s character personalities are also quite complex and can keep the viewer guessing at characters&#039; true personalities and motives for episodes upon episodes because of how mysterious every character is (with the exception of Keiichi). During Kai, the characters often adopt a more optimistic or positive outlook on everything as a result of their efforts to work together against a common enemy.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: If you cannot tell by now, I thoroughly enjoyed both seasons of Higurashi and am definitely going to re-watch them both at least a few more times in the future. What is not to love moe girls that have a murderous streak to them? ^^<br />
<br />
Overall: My favourite anime series. If you have not seen this, please watch it IMMEDIATELY! The world needs more Higurashi fans. Also, I am aware that a third season of Higurashi will be released sometime this year and I am anxiously anticipating its release. Hopefully, it will explain what happened at the very end of the second season, since I was left feeling fairly confused... but that might just be because I was too stupid to interpret the ending accurately O_o Thanks for reading, I hope it helped!

    I will say this now, if you have not seen the anime called Higurashi no Naku koro ni, then this review will be as useful as the dust that lies under your bed.<br />
<br />
With that said, most of what I have to say about Kai will be a rehash of what I said in my season 1 review; therefore, I will not be giving a detailed review. Instead, I will say what I thought were the stronger aspects in Kai compared to that of the first season. No doubt, both seasons of Higurashi were wonderful and one cannot exist without the other. Because of this, it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1837">
        is not exactly fair for me to use the same criteria I use with a stand alone season series or a stand alone anime. Thus, I rate and review Kai based on what was different, whether it be an improvement or not, from season 1.<br />
<br />
Story: As said earlier, Kai is a direct continuation of where season 1 left off. Kai shows the last two answer arcs of Higurashi plus an anime-exclusive arc to fill up the holes to answers that were missing from season 1. Every mystery or question posed in the first season is answered nicely. The way everything falls together is very well thought out. The solutions provided to the mystery leaves very little things unanswered. <br />
<br />
Art/Animation: Vast improvement in the art department from the last seasons. Animation, however, while it is much better, can still be inconsistent. Well, Higurashi was never known for its animation, and it does its job fine without KyotoAni, Bones, or Madhouse quality animation.<br />
<br />
Sound: One aspect of Kai that was the same as the first season. The first season had an OP that matched very well with its atmosphere and mood. Kai was no different. Instead of the creepy, unsettling feeling, Kai uses an OP the shows the drama and desperation of Rika&#039;s struggle. The voice acting is still superb, and besides the major theme that is used in Kai and some new tracks, the music remains the same.<br />
<br />
Characters: I found the character development to be better and given more time in Kai. While the first season introduced and partially developed the characters, they are fully fleshed out in Kai, especially Rika. Even the characters that you think played minor roles in the first season, Akasaka, Tomitake, Takano, Irie, and Ooishi, gets a good deal of development.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: While I had a lot more fun brainstorming theories and (sometimes, not always) being confused, I enjoyed Kai for other reasons. Firstly, I loved Minagoroshi-hen. It is, no doubt, my favorite Higurashi arc. While some people might enjoy watching psychotic girls beat the hell out of a certain, horrible uncle (I mean, who does not?), I had just as much fun watching Keiichi give his epic speeches. After all, Keiichi is called the Magician of Words for a reason. I also enjoyed watching as everything unfolded.<br />
<br />
Overall:This would average out to a 9.4. I did think there was improvement of pacing, being a lot more consistent, quality wise, than season 1, and the awesome ending. The pacing in season 1 felt rushed at some parts and caused certain facts to be left out. Thankfully, most of that was rectified in Kai. So yes, in some ways, I did think Kai was superior to the first season. The first season did really well in setting up the mystery and atmosphere. While Kai&#039;s atmosphere may seem too different from that of season 1, it is actually a lot closer to its original source material (the VN). Of course, I will not be going into this, but overall, the way the story unfolds is wonderful, especially if some of your theories turns out to be correct. Even with all that said, this series is not perfect. While the ending itself and final episode was brilliant, the lead up to that ending was weak and could have been executed better. Even with that said, Higurashi, as a whole, is a series that I would definitely recommend. Final verdict: 9/10

    Imagine you are an Olympic boxer, about to enter the gold medal match. It&#039;s going to be you&#039;re toughest fight, the world title holder thrice in a row. You&#039;ve studied his moves, you&#039;re prepared, you know you can win and relish the challenge. You enter the ring and prepare for the greatest fight of your life. The bell rings! You launch forward... only to find your opponent collapsed on the ground due to a heart attack.<br />
<br />
You won! But what&#039;s the feeling? Elation? Disappointment? Or a weird mixture of both?<br />
<br />
Whatever that emotion is, that&#039;s what&#039;ll you feel upon completion of Higurashi Season 2. Brilliant twists, unparalleled

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9901">
        suspense, the series builds to a full crescendo as the true devils behind the horrors of this countryside village is revealed is stunning fashion. All that is left is for the final confrontation, the one that will end it all...<br />
<br />
You brace yourself. You know what the characters you&#039;ve grown to love are up against, you know it&#039;ll be an uphill struggle. Yet, you know that with their sheer brilliance, they&#039;ll likely succeed. The three final episodes are finally here, and you prepared yourself to wowed, just as you were for the past 26 episodes... eager to see just what ingenious plan Kiechi and his group of resilient girls have brewed.<br />
<br />
Then... suddenly, you&#039;re watching something the looks like came straight of Home Alone. The antagonist&#039;s forces, always so powerful, so disciplined, and so deadly, has magically transformed into a mob of bumbling fools. The comedic, idiotic and pathetic ways in which the villains appear totally out of place.<br />
<br />
Its like watching Terminator, where after surviving massive explosions and shot gun shellls to the head, Arnold suddenly got killed by a Knife in the gut. You scream `WTF?&#039;? Where&#039;s those snipers? Where those silencers? Did all the villains just drop themselves in a a barrel of toxic goo and had their IQ reduced by 50?<br />
<br />
It seemed like he writers just run out brilliant ideas something so powerful could be defeated... and decided to take the easy way. This a true pity, given that the second arc was a true masterpiece, one-upping everything in both seasons combined.<br />
<br />
In the end, a final rating for Higurashi ni Ki difficult to give. Up till the final episodes, the series deserves a 10/10. The meets, and even surpasses the incredible standards set by the season before. They have managed to construct a mystery that is unpredictable, and yet fits naturally with all clues given before, creating that elusive `Eureka&#039; moment that is almost magical.<br />
<br />
Yet, Higurashi fumbles at the critical moment, where the protagonists must use this knowledge to change their hellish destiny. The ending episodes are not bad (They deserve 7/10), but look immeasurable weak when compared to the hand standards set before.<br />
<br />
Is it worth watching? Absolutely! Is it an masterpiece? Almost. But just like seeing Terminator die to a knife wound, one just cannot help but feel a little disappointment at the ending and endings tend to have a last impression.

    After finishing the first Higurashi series, I was actually looking forward to seeing what Kai had in store for me. Despite my dislike of the horror genre, I was more than willing to give this one a chance too, since I was proven wrong by the former. I was proven wrong, all right, but it was not for the right reasons.<br />
<br />
Where the first Higurashi was centered on shocking the viewer at every turn, Kai went for a slower, more suspenseful approach. Because of this decision, this approach turned out to be exceedingly slow. With only two major arcs present and twenty-four episodes to use, many

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4634">
        events were stretched out beyond their limits. There were several occasions where the story virtually stalled for two episodes at a time with almost nothing being accomplished. Perhaps because of this, the twists that were thrown in became more surprising. There were just enough of these to help me see this series to its unexpected end.<br />
<br />
Luckily, thanks to this pacing change, I did see some good come out of Kai. With several major questions raised at the end of the first Higurashi, the series took each one and explained the reasoning behind everything clearly. I can safely say that I had no further questions about any past events when the final credits rolled. There was one other good thing about this slower approach; something that I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect. The amount of back story given was a rather nice treat. Most of this was focused around Takano, someone that barely received any time in the first season, but proved to hold much more that what I saw previously. Her story was more compelling and memorable than the actual plot ever was at any given point.<br />
<br />
Throughout the entire run of Kai, there seemed to be something missing. The sense of paranoia that was so prevalent in the first season was absent. Granted, this had to do with the focus shift, but there still could have been a way to keep it in the plot. Without the constant fear that someone or something may be lurking around the corner, this series felt rather dull outside of Takano&#039;s story. At least the beginning and ending of each episode is enjoyable with the new opening and ending themes.<br />
<br />
When all was said and done, I could do nothing but sigh. The ending may have been satisfying, but I still wanted more. Despite my distaste for graphic violence and horror, I actually wished that it were there from the beginning. That, my friends, is saying something.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.<br />
<br />
Worst sequel ever.<br />
<br />
Reasons:<br />
<br />
There are many reasons, but the greatest failure in Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai is the way it ends. I&#039;ve endured tons of episodes, for the sake of finally seeing HOW  Rika would overcome her fate.  And what did I learn from watching Kai?<br />
<br />
1.If you want to overcome your destiny, just  set up some overly lame traps, in the forest that can take down even an army. <br />
<br />
2. Hire a Chuck Norris(known Akasaka Mamoru here), and make him beat up 7-8 members of Yamainu with his bare hands(ending of episode 22). (This whole 1 vs 8

          <span style="display: none;" id="review17346">
        is totally unbelievable on its own, not to mention the fact that Yamainu MUST HAVE HAD weapons with them, so why didn&#039;t they just shot down that policeman??????<br />
Beats me.<br />
<br />
(edit: oh and he just allowed them to return to their base instead of tieing them up with a rope or something...see beginning of episode 23...funny, how did they get back??)<br />
<br />
3. Did you know that, with only 4 people you can take control of an underground base?  Well in Higurashi it isn&#039;t impossible, even if one of the 4 people is a schoolgirl and another one is a doctor.<br />
<br />
But let&#039;s talk a bit about the childish traps I mentioned above. As I said it&#039;s completely unrealistic that some kids from a village can take down a platoon of  trained soldiers. But it&#039;s not only that. The other thing that really annoyed me at this part, is the total lack of any tension. Just compare it to the first series of Higurashi and you will see the difference.<br />
<br />
 Keiichi and the others were hunted by soldiers who wanted to kill them. What would be the normal reaction of people who are surrounded by armed soldiers in a forest? Well, I&#039;ve never been in such a frightening situation, but I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;d be  scared. <br />
<br />
Now look at the face of the characters in Higurashi when they are in the forest with the soldiers. Do they look scared to you? NO<br />
Not only they aren&#039;t scared, but they keep on laughing and joking with each other!!!  WHAT A JOKE!  Totally ruins the tension.<br />
<br />
Just 2  concrete examples:<br />
<br />
In episode 13 a Yamainu car stops near Keiichi and the others and Keiichi suggests capturing it(baseball bat and a meat cleaver vs firearms.....yeah they have a chance). Mion then says she will drive the car if they manage to capture it. Someone then asks if Mion has a driving license(what does it matter in this situation anyway?), Mion replies something, then Satoko begins to laugh loudly.(meanwhile the Yamainu car is right in front of them packed with people trying to kill them,  but looks like these kids aren&#039;t interested in such minor things. They&#039;re having fun.)<br />
<br />
Or in episode 24 when Keiichi and Hanyuu use a loudspeaker to scare away the WELL TRAINED MIGHTY soldiers aaaand THEY SUCCEED! LOL<br />
I hope there aren&#039;t any soldiers like these in my country&#039;s military force, because if there are, then we are in great trouble.<br />
<br />
And of course after this hyperlame   &quot;psychological warfare&quot;, the kids begin to happily praise each other, laugh at each other and trying to act funny like usually. Well they have every reason to do so right?....I mean they can&#039;t be sure how many ARMED SOLDIERS remained in the forest TRYING TO KILL THEM.<br />
<br />
I honestly don&#039;t get the author&#039;s true intention. There are episodes that give me the feeling that this anime is aimed at an older audience because of the gore and cruelty. Yet there are episodes which are so childish, that I would only show them to  little kids in the age group of 8-12.<br />
<br />
The author took the cheapest solution in everything in this anime.(referring to the childish traps and Chuck Norris...I mean Akasaka Mamoru&#039;s fate changing fists)<br />
<br />
Same with this whole hallucination thing. Why create a satisfying explanation to the series??? Yeah, just take all the questions that has been raised in the first series and explain everything with hallucination even  if it doesn&#039;t make any sense sometimes(at least to me). Maybe you think it was a really good twist, OK I know it&#039;s just a matter of taste, but for me it looked like the author didn&#039;t want to spend a lot of time trying to figure out a fine resolution for the series and ended up with this because it&#039;s the cheapest of all.<br />
<br />
(<br />
Even you can write such stories. It&#039;s really simple......just put every craziness that occurs to you into the first season, then in the second one, just say that all those stuffs were just someone&#039;s imagination.  It&#039;s not that complicated.<br />
)<br />
<br />
<br />
And as I mentioned there are  still things that I don&#039;t understand....<br />
<br />
In the first series, they mentioned that people keep dying and disappearing ALWAYS on the day of the Watanagashi, and they called this the Curse of Oyashiro-Sama. I found this really cool, because it&#039;s full of mystery and stuff and of course I didn&#039;t wonder why it&#039;s happening always the same day(after all it&#039;s a curse).<br />
THEN we found out that the curse is actually a virus(parasites to be more accurate). So I ask the question now. <br />
Why did the killings and disappearances always happened on the same day??<br />
There isn&#039;t any mystical curse now. What we have is a virus that activates itself when someone gets stressed, or leave Hinamizawa. Takano Miyo was the one who killed Rika&#039;s parents purposely on the day of Watanagashi, so the villagers would believe in the curse and again Takano was the one who killed that photographer AGAIN on the day of Watanagashi for the same reason.<br />
BUT this still doesn&#039;t explain the other killings.<br />
That director of the dam project had gone crazy on the day of the Watanagashi  and was killed by the workers out of self-defense. Then 1 or 2 years later on the same day the parasites within Satoko&#039;s body became active which caused Satoko to push down her &quot;parents&quot; off the cliff. Then year(s) later AGAIN on the exact same  day Satoshi&#039;s aunt was killed while Satoshi disappeard. What a coincidence.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t shake the feeling that the creator of this anime had only one purpose while creating the first series. Complicating things and complicating things and complicating things  then suddenly he realized: &quot;OMG this won&#039;t make any sense in the second season! Oh well the people surely won&#039;t notice  minor failures, if I make the story really overcomplicated and put in this hallucination thing.&quot; (This whole dying-on-the exact-same-day stuff was only included to make the story scarier and to raise the mystery level, after all it doesn&#039;t make any sense if it&#039;s not a curse.)<br />
<br />
Reminds me of the series, Twin Peaks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: (YEAHH! Here comes the fun part.)<br />
<br />
Keiichi: <br />
<br />
One of the thing that annoyed me in Keiichi is him being a total pushover. No matter what kind of contest he takes part in, he sucks always. Card game in Episode 1...he lost , eating contest....he lost, fight against Rena with Water Guns....it was a draw!!!!(holy ****) , fight against Rena on the top of the roof of the school...he lost, zombie tag in the school....he lost, playing a card game again when Hanyuu was a newcomer....guess what...HE LOST AGAIN. And like the rest of the characters, he was always acting cheerful even there was no reason for it and was totally unrealistic given the situation he were in.<br />
<br />
A quick question: How many times Keiichi  gave  courage boosting speeches thorughout the series. <br />
<br />
A: 1               B: 2<br />
C: 3               D: Dunno the exact number, but if I have to guess than it&#039;s between 10000 and 20000(a little exaggeration  doesn&#039;t hurt, does it?)<br />
<br />
Yup you&#039;re right the correct answer is D. Congratulation.<br />
<br />
Seriously, it was so annoying to hear Keiichi&#039;s blabbering about friendship after the 500th time..........&quot;Never give up..You can&#039;t give up..You will make it beacuse we&#039;re here  with you blahblahblah.&quot; Basically he always repeated the same thing, but he used different words each time he gave a speech, so it won&#039;t be THAT annoying. <br />
<br />
Usually I don&#039;t mind such blabberings  in any anime, but here they were sooo forced and repetitive. By the time I reached episode 17-18 I could foretell when will be another Keiichi speech with 95% accuracy.<br />
<br />
Rena and Rika: (aka Kana, Kana?? and NIPA!) <br />
<br />
Rena&#039;s personality was virtually non-existent. IMO she was only included in the series because she is so  kawaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii with her constant &quot;kana, kana&quot; and &quot;I&#039; ll take her  home!!&quot;. In the beginning I DID find her cute(and freaking psycho too) but this feeling quickly changed to ..........bah I don&#039;t know how to describe it without using vulgar words......let&#039;s say I don&#039;t like her anymore.<br />
<br />
As for Rika....NIPA! So dull.....and why is she speaking  with 2 voices? Looks like some kind of splitted personality so I used google.com to search around a little bit and I found out that the other, more serious voice Rika has, belongs to Frederica Bernkastel... you know the witch from Umineko no Naku Koro Ni(episode 5). Someone even said this (of course it&#039;s not confirmed officially and it DOES sound lame IMO): <br />
<br />
&quot;Frederica is the combined form of the mental states Rika had in each of the alternate Hinamizawas&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah right, and I&#039;m Santa Claus. Someone reads too much fan fiction here.<br />
<br />
Oh and Rika&#039;s/Frederica&#039;s behavior is really irrational sometimes. If I wanted to warn Akasaka that his wife&#039;s life is in danger then I&#039;d probably say <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey dude, your wife is in danger so leave Hinamizawa go back to the hospital immediately before it&#039;s too late.&quot; <br />
<br />
and not<br />
<br />
&quot;Akasaka! Go home to Tokyo! You should hurry along home to Tokyo.(and here comes the best part)  Otherwise you&#039;ll seriously regret your decision.&quot;<br />
<br />
WHAT THE HELL??(she was even smiling like some kind of evil mastermind)<br />
<br />
Why coudn&#039;t she just be more concrete?? It&#039;s like Rika/Frederica knew that she was starring in a horror anime so she was supposed to act scary in front of the viewers. <br />
<br />
As I said, the creator of this rubbish.....I mean anime, wanted to scare the viewers with everything he had whether it makes sense or not.<br />
<br />
Satoko: <br />
<br />
Not much to say, I liked her laughing most of the times. Until it became annoying as well.......<br />
<br />
Mion: <br />
<br />
My favorite girl of the series. It&#039;s not like she was THAT special, but at least she didn&#039;t have  annoying catchphrases or unrealistic personality. She was normal and that&#039;s a big deal here.<br />
<br />
and finally Hanyuu:<br />
<br />
First she was the queen of pessimism -  Hauu. Then in the final episodes she suddenly became a real badass and announced that she was a god  - Hauu.<br />
Maybe it&#039;s just me but if someone said the word &quot;god&quot; to me, the image of Hanyuu would be the last thing that&#039;d  pop up in my mind.   Hauuuu.<br />
<br />
Lol I&#039;ve just remembered another &quot;interesting&quot; stuff about Rika so let&#039;s return to her for a moment. Previously I was talking about, unrealistic behaviors, wasn&#039;t I?<br />
<br />
So let me ask you a question. What&#039;d you do if you were in Rika&#039;s place? How&#039;d you gather allies in order to defeat the Yamainu. I mean, everybody&#039;d think you went nuts, if you began to talk about parasites and infinite time loops suddenly, without backing them up with proofs. <br />
<br />
IT&#039;S SO OBVIOUS that the easiest way to make the others believe you is to predict something that will happen in the near future and then everyone will believe your story when they see you&#039;re prediction is right. <br />
The same way Rika did in episode 6 of Kai.......in episode 6 of Kai......<br />
........after being in the time loop for at least 100 years, she realizes something totally obvious.  No comment.<br />
<br />
And another funny thing occured to me while I was writing......this is related to the final episode of Kai, when the Banken arrives(you know that special combat unit).<br />
<br />
Takano asked the leader of Yamainu why didn&#039;t he keep fighting and the leader replied that the banken is a special combat unit so they didn&#039;t have any chance to win against them.<br />
<br />
Well I think the correct answer would have been this:<br />
<br />
&quot; How could we have any chance against trained soldiers, if most of our people were defeated by a bunch of  kids?&quot;(oh and most of them were girls)<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t want to waste more time  with this review so I&#039;ll stop here. I could lament all day why this anime is so bad, but it&#039;d be pointless. <br />
<br />
 It&#039;s a sad thing that the once great Higurashi became a total joke. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading this.<br />

    before you start to hate me for the low score listen to my reasons. I watched the first season and found it to be amazing and easily deserved a 10 rating. This season was the same universe but felt like it was written by someone else. Where the first season gave you suspense and fear, the second season was too corny and drawn out at boring parts to do anything for me.<br />
<br />
While I found Hanyou adorable, I also found her to be detrimental to the story. The first season made it possible for the cause of madness to be anything from disease to aliens. With

          <span style="display: none;" id="review7563">
        the introduction of Hanyou I expected her and Rika to start fighting crime in sailor fuku. <br />
<br />
The ending was in my opinion horrible. All of a sudden these characters who were so human and vulnerable were able to take down an army. I could talk more about the conclusion but it would be a spoiler filled rant.<br />
<br />
One thing I never get or like is when all of a sudden the main character becomes a supporting character. This season seemed to be all about Rena, Rika, and Hanyou where the first season focused on Keiichi and Rika. I found that it hurt the character development you get to see in the first season.<br />
<br />
In all this would have been an okay anime by itself but following such amazing first season, in comparison, it is rather mediocre.

    You know, after playing the excruciating visual novel of Higurashi for PS2<br />
Or the PC game. I told myself that when the anime adaption I&#039;d<br />
Undoubtedly hate it. To my shock the anime was such an improvement I  <br />
Just could not get over myself.  The story,  just like it&#039;s previous season is Unique and  a bit confusing, however, this season is where things are finally <br />
Starting to be explained. All of the &quot;wait I don&#039;t get it&quot; and &quot;I&#039;m confused&quot; <br />
That you may have been saying to yourself or out loud stop. In Kai,<br />
Losing for Rika &amp; Hanyū are not an option. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review202833">

Overall shape the relationship between our beloved friends in Hinamizawa.<br />
So moving on, The art is still cliche for it&#039;s time. Can&#039;t really say it&#039;s bad, but<br />
There really could have been more improvements made to our characters.<br />
That said, the OST is amazing, it complements the nonstop drama in <br />
Hinamizawa. Now, if you did watch the first season I would recommend this<br />
Enjoyable, watchable, and dramatic season. Higurashi Kai does a really<br />
Great job finishing off where Season 1 left off, When you start it, it&#039;s not <br />
At all like you&#039;re going into something completely new, 7th expansion does a <br />
Magnificent job at giving you something old, changing it adding new<br />
Elements and etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall I gave this show 9/10 out of ten because personally<br />
I felt more could&#039;ve been done to make it new watcher friendly, and more background information on the characters so that it&#039;s even easier to understand. That aside,  regardless of its defects. Kai was and is still a masterpiece in my opinion and will always be one of my favorite shows.  Read the first letters down dudes.

    I have complained about the lack of resolution in the prior season of Higurashi. Boy, i should have shut my mouth back then.<br />
<br />
Higurashi Kai is the &#039;answer arc&#039; to the original Higurashi, the direct continuation which actually delivered great and fulfilling answers to what was merely speculated in the prior arcs. Those who have watched Higurashi are blasted with the fact that time apparently resets while a grand evil scheme is happening within those looping days. To why, how, we were not given a damn thing but lots and lots of cookie crumbs has been flaunted at our faces and we just had to patch

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410035">
        em up for the prime cookie and what a damn fine cookie it is.<br />
<br />
With the prior season&#039;s&#039; twists and turns already bent my expectations to a screw, I was so not prepared to learn that we had a decoy protagonist all this time. It was fricking marvelous to learn that i&#039;ve been bamboozled creatively. Kai gave us backgrounds to the characters and made it so that we get to the minds of each character in play in the Hinamizawa phenomenon and we get to see in the eyes of both the protagonist and the antagonists. The pacing was great and made me want to go from episode to episode just to watch what happens next. Writing was already good before but Kai cranked that up further with its engaging plot and how the mystery is being shed light bit by bit all the while culminating in one of the best final arcs of any anime. <br />
<br />
Art remains the same, does it job but not really remarkable. The action scenes remain janky but its shock factor bits remain well-executed nonetheless. With how the story progressed, gore is actually toned down and i cannot tell you it was for the worse. For what its worth, Kai actually got better in its storytelling in exchange for gore and i would not have it otherwise. <br />
<br />
Sound remains good. Its OP remains evocative, though not as memorable of the first. ED is kinda forgettable but it might be because i skip it immediately so that i get to the next episode faster. Japanese voice acting was fine, prominently Rika, Rena, and Hanyu though i find Satoko&#039;s voice somewhat odd. <br />
<br />
While i sing the highest praises of Higurashi, i did feel that that there&#039;s something amiss that prevented it from getting a perfect score in my eyes. I do feel that it was because of its final seconds where a completely headscratching scene played out and left me with a WTF look.  Likewise, i did feel some plot armor was deployed for some reason. Nonetheless, Higurashi Kai is probably one of the best follow-up seasons in anime ever and completed the series in a high note. It has a satisfying conclusion, a brilliant use of a call-back, and a story that is a total rollercoaster of blood, sweat and tears...literally. It was a sin to keep myself from watching Higurashi in years past. <br />
<br />
A decade old but with a timeless tale of friendship, trust, and psychopathic shenanigans. This is a classic and shall remain a classic in my eyes. <br />

    In this season we get three arcs, the remaining &quot;Answer Arc&quot; that we did not got in the first season and two other Answer Arcs that will unveil the rest of the mysteries left in the 1st season. This title has transitioned into a Thriller, leaving behind most of the blood and gore from the first season. Don&#039;t get me wrong, there are still frightening and intense scenes, but now they are used to add to the Suspense, it is not as graphic as before. <br />
<br />
The MC role has changed from Keiichi to Rika, who is a more interesting character. The Supernatural still plays a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414204">
        major part in the story, which mix perfectly with the mystery, and help to explain some situations. The 3-arc structure follows the basics of a Hitchcockian Suspense, there is a promise made by the MC, there is a time limit to fulfill that promise, and there is a set of constrains. The storytelling follows these religiously, and the main reason why it transitions so good, pacing is phenomenal. The director takes advantage of the Chibi/Moe character design fantastically, also from the Hitchcockian school, face close-ups, you can read the mind of the characters just by watching their eyes, and their facial expressions. <br />
<br />
The Music/Score is also masterfully implemented. We are also unveiled who the main antagonist is, and it is so unexpected that it blew my mind, we also get a bunch of background from this character that makes us understand the motives to the point that I was empathetic. I have absolutely zero issues with this season, none, its a perfectly executed Thriller.

    What did we see in Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni so far?<br />
<br />
Well, it&#039;s been an amazing journey through the depths of human psychology, telling us that everyone is capable of becoming a killer under different circumstances... Watanagashi&#039;s mysteries were quite fascinating and there were specific scenes and moments the watcher won&#039;t forget that easily, in matter of psychological tension or brutal violence. The season ended with a slight glance of hope to escape the murder scenario repetition going on, so the watcher was looking forward seeing the resolve of that twisted maze.<br />
<br />
Then there was Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Kai... ...and the tension was gone.<br />
<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19581">
        second season of Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni was successful in erasing every intriguing aspect of the first one.<br />
<br />
- The Story:<br />
The second season tells you every answer you need to understand what&#039;s going on in Hinamizawa, not only once, but plenty of times, so that even the most distracted watchers would understand. Maybe because of that, the answers presented seem very odd and the excitement level drops. The rest of the screentime is used in more unnecessary scenario repetitions, which feel quite inappropriate,  because you already had a complete season using this method and it becomes boring. The higher quality of exciting psychological mystery plot vanishes and gives way to some kind of youth adventure filled with plotholes, similar to Spielberg&#039;s The Goonies...<br />
<br />
- The Atmosphere:<br />
Higurashi was all about the tension created by the menacing situation the main characters were in. Well, because of the disappearance of most of the elements concerning that, the atmosphere becomes dull and you start to loose the contact to the characters. Also, because of the trivial answers you get to the big mystery, the enigmatic factor in atmosphere gets lost as well. In the final part of the season, the watcher will find himself watching some kind of Arnold Schwarzenegger movie with oneliners, shootouts and fistfights... THAT completely destroyed the mood...<br />
<br />
- The Design<br />
This is one of the few minor improvements Higurashi went through. The character design looks far smoother than season one&#039;s did. Also, the rate of SD usage was increased, which makes the humorous sequences more enjoyable than in season one.<br />
<br />
-The Final Conclusion:<br />
Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Kai destroyed most of the precious elements of the first series. The psychological mystery disappeared complety, the disturbing scenes of violence are not disturbing anymore and the twisted plot gets cleared in a most trivial way. Even without comparing the second season to the first, you will still find yourself bored by the redundant scenario repetitions and the more than unnecessary flashback sequences.

    Even though Higurashi no naku koro ni Kai and Higurashi no naku koro ni are in the same series as a whole, they have fundamental differences. I&#039;m not going to go on about how season one was better or worse, but I will point out some things that were interesting to me. <br />
<br />
Story: I was very pleased with the story, and how it really shed some light on questins presented in the first series. As some may know, the Higurashi franchise is divided into question and answer arcs.<br />
With Kai, I was no longer in the dark about why there were arcs, and why there are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36960">
        sudden changes and the story seems to restart, as this concept is not explored in the first season. Higurashi Kai takes you through two very exciting answer arcs that are a direct response to the first series. The development of the story was brilliant, and I found it to be very enjoyable. It has a sense of hope that the first season could not provide, but still keeps you on the edge of your seat, and guessing. The way that the questions and mysteries of the first season were answered was amazing. A lot of main plot questions were tied up, with a few mysteries left to the imagination. I also found the development and pacing of the story to be much more enjoyable than that of the first. <br />
<br />
Art: The character art for season one felt very rushed. This season seems to improve on that a little bit. It&#039;s no &quot;5 Centimeters Per Second&quot; by any stretch of the imagination, but I still felt that the background scenery, at least, was enough to be immersive. It makes you feel like you&#039;re really in the story and plays a very major roll in the development of the plot. <br />
<br />
Animation: I definitely saw an improvement in animation from the first series. The animation doesn&#039;t look like it was pressed for time, and there are less weak animation spots.<br />
<br />
Sound: The sound in this Higurashi series, like the first, was absolutely outstanding. The creators have outdone themselves again with music, themes, and jingles that make the series believable and fit it perfectly. I think they used some of the sounds again from the first series, which made it even more enjoyable. I especially like the opening theme. For example, Higurashi no naku koro ni had an opening that created a very unsettling feeling, just like the show. On the other hand, Higurashi Kai&#039;s opening invoked a more hopeful feeling in me as a listener. Not to mention that the iconic cicadas chirping in the background of many scenes carries throughout the entire series.<br />
<br />
Character: The character development was a lot better in Higurashi Kai, as is true because there were more answers arcs. In Higurashi season one, the characters were built at the beginning with little bits over time. Characters that didn&#039;t seem to play a substantial role, ended up being very significant in Higurashi Kai. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I would definitely say that I enjoyed this series more than the first because it leaves the viewer with enough answers to feel substantiated. I really enjoyed the pacing and the &quot;just for fun&quot; (filler) episodes. This series really shows how the characters can work together to fight for what they believe in and emphasizes the feeling of community in the group of main characters, and side characters they&#039;ve met along the way.<br />
<br />
Overall: The series was very enjoyable, and I find that it meets all the expectations that I would consider for a great anime. All the effects and situations the characters were put in, show how much they really care for each other, which is a big difference from what the first series shows. Higurashi Kai is an anime that I would put as a &quot;must watch&quot; category for any fan of the thriller, suspense, or horror genres.

    Disheartening Sunset<br />
<br />
Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni Kai [Kai] is the sequel to the popular original [Higurashi] that aired the year before, based off the 07th Expansion&#039;s sound novels of the same name. The first season covered the four arcs of the original game and the first two arcs of the sequel. Kai covers the last two arcs of the second game and give closure to mysteries presented in Higurashi. <br />
<br />
Kai&#039;s story is satisfying at the very most. The riddles that hung like loose threads are woven together nicely giving us most of the big picture. A few questions are left unanswered, which hopefully Rei, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review18933">
        second sequel, will answer. <br />
<br />
With this in mind, it&#039;s still hard to say that Kai at any way lives up to the drama of the first. The characters become paper actors, two dimensional, lacking their psychological depth. I commend the series for giving Furude Rika personality, being the main protagonist between both halves of the show. It could be debated she was the shallowest of the Hinamizawa crew in the first outing, but I feel that rest of the club was sacrificed and should have maintained their complexity.<br />
<br />
The atmosphere as well is very upbeat, at each turn of the plot, glass balls of sunshine and hope illuminate the way for our protagonists. It&#039;s disappointing considering the most engaging element of the original was the dances of blood and gore and the gritty realization that their is no light at the end of tunnel. <br />
<br />
Production<br />
<br />
We come across similar fare in Kai. There is no noticeable improvement in animation or art which is unfortunate. In the first the super deformed character model served a foil to the violence committed by the characters. In Kai, they serve as symbols for Higurashi&#039;s new found optimism, which I found to be more ineffective as a device. <br />
<br />
The music and voice acting were similar to the first. I must say I appreciated Yukari Tamura&#039;s work behind Rika. The Violet haired priestess moved between bouts of depression and when she wore a mask of delight, which Tamura handled expertly. The line &quot;Nippa&quot; was endlessly endearing, feeling an &#039;Aww&#039; form at my lips every time she uttered the word. <br />
<br />
Watchability and Enjoyment<br />
<br />
Kai requires you to watch the original, making it even less accessible than Higurashi, which required you to have a strong stomach. Kai isn&#039;t as addictive as the first either, I found myself trudging from episode to episode just to learn more about the skeletons in Hinamizawa&#039;s closet. Though, sometimes at the end of each twenty-one minute session I was left wondering, &quot;How come no one is being hacked to fucking pieces! This is HINAMIZAWA! Why ain&#039;t the bodies hitting the floor?!&quot; Maybe I&#039;m just a Sadist. <br />
<br />
Themes<br />
<br />
Kai looks up, where as Higurashi looked down. The glass ceiling of fate is meant to be shattered by will power. Ignore the glass shards that will come raining down on those around us, we must always move forward. In Higurashi fate acted as an iron maiden, not a question of if, but when it&#039;s spikes would make swiss cheese out of your soul. In Kai, fate is tub of play-doh, ours to mold and create. <br />
<br />
Closing Thoughts<br />
<br />
Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni Kai is easy to recommend to those that have seen the first for one reason alone: the antagonist is finally revealed. The show fails to deliver a product as engrossing as the first but that is the nature of sequels I suppose. Unless it&#039;s Godfather II of course.

~ Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni - Onikakushi-hen Visual Novel<br />
<br />
________________<br />
<br />
As humans, we can never completely have trust in each other. No matter what, we are fated to always have the slightest bit of doubt about each other. Even undeniable companionship can be suspected and doubted.<br />
<br />
“Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni” (Higurashi) and it’s subsequent sequel “Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Kai” (Higurashi Kai) explore this idea of learning to trust your friends with undeniable certainty. While the former focuses on the character’s descent into paranoia, the latter shows the fight against paranoia - to have faith in your friends and defy fate.<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
<br />
Higurashi, referring to both sections, has an extraordinary story with powerful themes that are effectively discussed.<br />
<br />
In the first episode, protagonist and transfer student - Keiichi Maebara - visits the junkyard with his friend - Rena Ryuugu - where he discovers that a brutal murder occurred in Hinamizawa where the victim’s body was dismembered by a group of people. Concerningly, one of the perpetrators hasn’t been found. Every year since then, a murder of one and the dissapearance of another takes place during the village’s Cotton Drifting Festival. The locals attribute this to “Oyashiro-sama” - a deity of the village. If one upsets this deity, then they will be punished accordingly.<br />
<br />
At the end of episode 4, Maebara Keiichi claws at his throat and kills himself not before murdering his two classmates - Rena and Mion Sonozaki. Peculiarly, in the next episode, all of the characters are brought back to life; they are all friends again as if the events of the previous arc never happened. All of the events are locked in a time loop which all occurs in June 1983. In each arc, while most of the plot points stay the same, something slightly different happens that causes a character to doubt their friends, provoking their violent tendencies.<br />
<br />
That is the basic structure of a “question arc”, which includes the first four arcs of the series. As the name suggests, they create questions, such as “Why did ‘Character A’ kill?”, “What happened to ‘Character B’?”, and, most importantly, “Why is everything happening?”.<br />
<br />
These arcs put the audience in the position of the terror-stricken detective. Each subsequent arc supplements the audience with just enough information for there to be a possibility of connection between them. This compels the audience to have a more intimate relation to the story. We might believe some information to be true - only to be denied by another arc, completely destroying your previous understanding of the story. The pieces are all there; we just need to figure out if they connect, how they connect, even if they are real - or part of some character’s imagination.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Interestingly, at the beginning of most arcs, there is a preview for the end of each arc. The audience is transparently told which characters are going to die. Unlike conventional horror, which mostly revolves around jumpscares, no shock value is used in Higurashi. The audience is scared, not because of the fear of “who’s going to die” but “how this happens”; how these kind friends come to murder each other. <br />
<br />
These terror-inducing scenes are intertwined with “slice-of-life” episodes, which creates a major tonal dissonance with the later parts of the arc. It is jarring, which helps create uneasiness. The audience is conflicted between indulging in the enjoyment and being cautious. They are just waiting for someone to kill another; they doubt the friend group’s ability to ascend out of paranoia (not unlike Hanyuu)[b]. The audience vicariously feels the character’s descent into paranoia - allowing the audience to entertain the reality of these characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
In contrast, Higurashi Kai generally has most of the “answer arcs”, which answer the questions posed by the “question arcs”. It discusses defiance against fate and learning to trust your friends<br />
<br />
This creates a huge tonal shift in the series that some people did not enjoy. It is a lot more somber and emotional - rather than horror based. Throughout all the time loops, the characters have struggled and failed to try and reach their happy ending; in all of their attempts, they have failed and met tragic ends. However, there will always be a light no matter how dark the tunnel is. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS:<br />
<br />
Despite the time loop, all of the characters have a lot of layers and dimension to them. While, most of the characters do not have character arcs, they are still compelling since we learn more about their existing character throughout each arc. Characters do not change, but their actions do.<br />
<br />
Keiichi comes across as a generic relatable protagonist, which prompts the audience to sympathize with him. He goes insane over doubting his friends which leads to, sometimes, exaggerated reactions. However, he shows face when the situation calls for him. Throughout the second season, he actively works against what he would naturally do and takes the best course of action to ensure everyone is happy because, at the end of the day, he loves his friends. The audience is led to sympathize with him as we see everything from his perspective for the first three arcs. As such, their relationship with the whole world and its characters are through Keiichi. It’s tragic to see him kill Rena and Mion in the first arc but, even after finding the answer, we can still understand him. Nothing he did was wrong or illogical; it was just an unfortunate circumstance. <br />
<br />
Rika is one of the few characters who actually has a character arc. As such, she naturally has the most development. In the first season, she is the most mysterious. It’s clear she possesses some knowledge of the time loops but the audience doesn’t learn much about this until the second season. Her character shifts from the overly adorable little girl to a mature nihilist. She doesn’t believe that there is anything to do than trying again. However, she does not have hope. Ironically, even though she does not suffer paranoia, she doubts her friends the most. Her journey is to learn to have faith and trust her friends. Like Satoko, she puts up a facade of cuteness. Whenever the situation is tense, she says, “Nipah~” and the situation is quelled. This is her scapegoat out of any situation where her friends might gain too much knowledge. In the same way, Hanyuu also doubts the friend group. While her character may seem purposeless, she is intended to serve as a stand in for the audience. Like the audience, she doubts the friend group and simply waits for their demise. Her growth, like the audience, is to learn to trust her friends.<br />
<br />
The Sonozaki Twins are also compelling characters. Mion portrays herself as the super up-beat tomboy and Shion portrays herself as sensitive and feminine. The second question arc and its answer arc provide the most development and characterization for them. [Spoilers] Because of her Sonozaki lineage, she has been characterized as possibly being the most villainous; the audience is led to doubt her the most. In the answer, her complete innocence is almost unimaginable. After Shion’s reveal as the true perpetrator, the audience feels such a complex myriad of emotions towards them. It’s tragic and heartbreaking that despite all of Mion’s suffering, the audience never understood her. Though it’s not explicitly stated, Mion used to love Satoshi. However, after learning about her sister’s affection for him, she resigned her love for him because she believed that it would create the best possible outcome. When Rena is going insane, Mion ensures that she gets the help that she needs. Mion’s overwhelming kindness is epitomized in the final arc of the series where she attempts to sacrifice herself.<br />
<br />
All of the other character&#039;s all have depth and personality that is unveiled in each arc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ANIMATION:<br />
<br />
The animation of Higurashi serves thematic purpose and adds to the horror of the show. A common criticism of the animation is that, while it’s perfect for the fluffy “Slice of Life” moments, it is unsuitable for the horror. While, from an objective standpoint, this statement is true, it isn’t completely purposeless. The most notable contrast is, during the horror, the exaggerated detail in a character’s facial expression. This diverges heavily from the “Slice of Life” scenes where there is little detail on the character’s faces. This exaggerated detail gives the character’s psychopathic expressions much more weight - especially when considering the contrast between the “Slice of Life” bits and the Horror bits.<br />
<br />
Less arguably, the lighting in the show is very well done. In almost all of the horror shots, there is an aspect of complete darkness and one of bright light. There are many possible purposes for this. It could represent the uncertainty of the information presented to us, with the darks. This is most apparent in the scene where Keiichi kills Rena and Mion. However, it could have also been used to create a sense of unease with how unusually bright and dark the scenes are.<br />
<br />
The character designs of the show all fit their intention as well. Due to Mion’s long skirt and jacket, which are commonly associated with the Yakuza, one may be led to believe the misconception that Mion is aggressive. Likewise, Rena’s character is intended to look overly warm and cute to contrast with the developments we learn in the first arc.<br />
<br />
<br />
SOUND:<br />
<br />
Higurashi’s music powerfully fulfills its purpose of creating the atmosphere. Half of the soundtrack consists of generic cheerful music for the more upbeat parts of the show. Whereas, the other half consists of depressing tracks for the horror scenes. The horror scenes are supported and are significantly more unsettling with their depressing tracks, as the audience sympathizes with the character’s mix of emotions.<br />
<br />
Some of these tracks, such as “Main Theme”, evolve over the course of the series. After completing the show, the audience feels a complex mix of emotions, somehow feeling both comforting and unsettling. For example, the track is played both when Keiichi kills Teppei and when Rena is confronted in the junkyard. While in the first scene, the audience understands Keiichi’s dread, anger, and vengeance; in the latter scene, the audience feels Rena’s regret and the friend group’s resolve.<br />
<br />
This is aided by the excellent Japanese dub. The voice actors do a good job at making these characters seem believable. During the scenes where the characters descend into despair, their screaming, crying, and yelling all carry emotion behind it. When Mion condemns Takano in the final scene, there is resolve behind her voice - resolve to protect her friends. When Shion laughs ferociously, the audience can detect her lack of remorse.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
NOTABLE SCENES:<br />
<br />
Satoko’s Death:<br />
<br />
Up until this point, the audience has learned most of Satoshi’s story. Satoko’s brother, Satoshi, was working to buy a bear for her but mysteriously disappeared - supposedly at the hands of the Sonozaki family. Shion believes that Satoko and Mion deserve to be punished for not helping Satoshi enough. Satoko’s sheer willpower to not cry because there is hope that her brother might still be alive is almost beautiful. After her brother’s death, she has worked hard to ensure that she is no longer a burden to her brother - that she is worthy of her brother. In that way, her death goes directly against the themes of hope. This is necessary to build and condition the audience’s despair.<br />
<br />
To the audience, Satoshi is already believed to be dead, which makes Satoko’s resolve much more powerful. She is clinging on to hope, only to be stabbed 25 times by Shion.<br />
<br />
Episode 22/23: Rena Ryuugu’s once-in-a-lifetime story endeavour:<br />
<br />
In the preview of this arc, the audience is led to believe that this scene is the end of the arc. The form of previews up until this point has been the conclusion of the arc. Even though this scene appears very early in the arc, the second episode, the audience has reason to believe that one of the characters will go insane. Rena’s monologue and the fact that her violence has already been triggered make this seem plausible. It’s eye opening that, despite the fact that Rena brutally massacred two people, her friends still reach out to her. Keiichi recognizes that Rena’s actions were atrocious and unacceptable but, as her friend, he accepts that. They trust her enough to forgive that murder. They trust her enough to hide the body, forget that her hands are bloody, and play with her. This begins the discussion of the themes of trusting your friends. So far, all of the murders only occurred because someone doubted the friendship. This, seemingly, evaporates all of that doubt. Their bonds are thicker than blood. Despite the sorrow tone in the main theme, it is played here which provides evidence for the audience’s suspicion that Rena might succumb to her paranoia. At the end of the scene, when no one is hurt, it conditions the audience to feel an array of emotions. The song now connotes both hope and dread at the same time. In the proceeding scene where they dispose of the body, no one talks and there is no music playing. The only audio features are the cicadas crying.<br />
<br />
CONCLUSION:<br />
<br />
“Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni” is one of the best examples of storytelling, pacing, and horror that anime has to offer. Combined with its unique narrative structure and its compelling characters, it is definitely worth your time.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no way to avert tragedy. There is no choice but to give up. But don&#039;t give up. Only you can stand up to this&quot;.<br />

    &quot;Someone taught me something- that the power of belief will give rise to a miracle that will cut through fate.&quot; - Hanyuu<br />
<br />
Preface: <br />
<br />
Birthday review!<br />
<br />
This review is solely for Higurashi Kai, which I will refer to as &quot;Kai&quot; from this point on. Since it&#039;s a part two, it&#039;s necessary to have seen the first set, as it&#039;s divided into &quot;question&quot; and &quot;answer&quot; arcs. This series formulates the many, complex answers to the question: What exactly is happening to Hinamizawa in June of 1983? <br />
<br />
<br />
Artwork and Animation: 7<br />
<br />
Like its predecessor, Kai is approaching 10 years old, and looks somewhat dated when put up against more recent efforts,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review189448">
        both by studio Deen and others. By no means does it detract from the show though, as the somewhat rough look gives it a dated feel too, and brings the rural 1983 Japanese mountains to life in a way that pulls you in with how it frames and presents the visuals. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s overall a very dark show, both in atmosphere and coloration, which intertwine excellently together to give it a dense, oppressive feel. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound and Voice Acting: 9<br />
<br />
The opening, &quot;Naraku no Hana (Flower in Hell)&quot;, by Eiko Shimamiya is a wonderfully haunting song that really sets the mood for the show, with lyrics to match. The ending song, &quot;Taishō.a&quot;, by anNina is even more foreboding, with soft violin and piano that really affixes the ending scenes in the mind&#039;s eye, like an ellipsis at the end of a particularly thought provoking sentence. <br />
<br />
Kenji Kawai, who also did the original Higurashi and Fate Stay Night&#039;s composition does more great work here. Most of the music is very atmospheric, setting the mood and tone for the show. It&#039;s very subtle, not in your face loud or obnoxiously playing over the characters. It creates tension, and resolution when necessary- very good. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s just say that Kai is the Yukari Tamura show, because her performance as Rika is nothing short of stunning. Certainly the best of her career, and that&#039;s saying something. As the focus is 90% on Rika throughout the show, we get a lot of time with her, and in three different voices. Ms. Tamura truly put in an award worthy performance for bringing little Rika to life through as many emotions and moods as can be brought through a visual medium in which the actors themselves are not present. Just excellent. <br />
<br />
However much talent Yukari Tamura showed, it&#039;s nearly matched by Miki Itou&#039;s Miyo Takano. As a character who wasn&#039;t fully fleshed out in the original series, she plays a much larger role here, and is explored through an emotional and compelling voice role. <br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 10<br />
<br />
The cast of Kai expands somewhat from the original series. The introduction of some new characters along with expanding the roles of previous supporting and main characters also expounded upon the intrigue that drives the heart of the show. Higurashi is a show that will lie to you. I was constantly on edge, trying to figure motivations and goals out, because it&#039;s never clear; not until it&#039;s too late. <br />
<br />
The focus changes from one of each arc having a main character to just two &quot;real&quot; main characters. This enables the character driven portion of the story to be a lot more fleshed out and have less of the disjointed feel that the original had, where the perspectives of the different characters were constantly changing. This is much more nailed down, and is better for it. The familiar and the new faces all have weight in the story- no one is there just for the sake of having the &quot;token character&quot; for plot devices. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 10 <br />
<br />
&quot;The sin of this world is like Old Maid. Everyone pushes the one Old Maid onto one another. It&#039;s not a game you seek to win, but one in which you seek to make someone the loser. The sacrifice.&quot; - Miyo Takano<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Kai takes a somewhat different tonal and execution approach to its predecessor, in that it&#039;s a much more complex and intrigue driven narrative than outright horror. Gone are the short arcs that depict brutal murders and a hanging sense of &quot;something is just...&#039;wrong&#039;&quot;, and in their place is a deep narrative filled with deceit, betrayal, hunger for power, cold blooded <br />
hate, and a myriad of dark themes. Where Higurashi is the &quot;tell&quot;, Kai is the &quot;show&quot;. <br />
<br />
The best suspense and mystery narratives are those that are not heavy handed in shoving the plot down your throat, but allowing you to discover for yourself, to guess and be proven wrong, and to ultimately be surprised and perhaps even shocked by the outcome. This is Higurashi. While everything is revealed to you in time and nothing left unresolved, the manner by which it slowly unveils creates a nearly tangible level of tension. Again, everything starts out happy and fun, but you know that it&#039;s just not going to end well. <br />
<br />
Kai, and Higurashi before it are shows that eliminate the element of surprise about how the arcs go, though. That&#039;s not to say they&#039;re predictable; no, it&#039;s that you &quot;know&quot; it&#039;s not going to end well... it&#039;s just how that ending comes about that is shocking and/or heart rending. Just when I thought it was going to be a good ending, so many things that can go wrong do, and it ends in a sorrowful way again. <br />
<br />
Unlike Higurashi part one, Kai is divided up into a mere 3 arcs, which allowed the plot to develop slowly, but with more (necessary) exposition. Again, it&#039;s a slow burn of a show: it twists and turns within the arcs, and when I thought I had everything figured out, it managed to turn everything on my head with revelations of who and why. Higurashi is predictably unpredictable- and that&#039;s the genius behind it.<br />
<br />
It doesn&#039;t have to be a straight Whodunnit horror show involving cutesy school kids, even thought that could have been plenty entertaining on its own. No, Kai takes it to the next level with a cleverly crafted political conspiracy and treachery by those in positions of power over others. The mysteries of the first series are just the base bricks built into the steps of the pyramid of deception, betrayal, and conspiracy of Higurashi in sum total. These, which ultimately lead to a narrative of immense proportions, and heights of weighty answers that were previously inconceivable from the prior portions of the story. <br />
<br />
A maze of irrational questions constructed elaborately by deft hands, that turn to a dark hallway with answers that are both revelatory and thought provoking- a real masterpiece. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
<br />
One of the things I liked most about this show was the very first episode, which serves as a direct epilogue to Higurashi part one. One of the most edge-of-my-seat, intriguing, and addictive openings to a series I&#039;ve seen, that served as an awesome introduction to the unveiling of the mysteries of Hinamizawa to come. <br />
<br />
A note:<br />
Due to the incident in 2007, where a 16 year old Kyotanabe girl murdered her father with an axe to the neck, some of the violence in the anime was censored, and certain parts edited out altogether (along with the cancellation of the last episode of School Days, airing the same time). With this event, there was a noticeable shift in the amount of extreme violence content vs the original series and manga. Not that the show is lacking such content altogether, but for a show that has built a reputation on brutality alongside Alfred Hitchcock style horror storytelling, it was strangely absent in some places. <br />
<br />
As mentioned above; the story was unpredictable, and in the best possible way. The characters all have their parts to play, and with an expanded cast- all of them get a fair share of development and exposition, though it would have been easier to sideline them. They all remain relevant, and the tone of the series is also very consistent- I very nearly felt time ticking by in their universe as I anxiously watched the events of June 1983 unfold once again. <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 10<br />
<br />
As both a mystery and a psychological horror show, Kai succeeds with flying, dark colors. As an intense, relentless narrative and a tragic, but ultimately beautiful story, Higurashi Kai surpasses all expectations. It has the necessary elements for an Alfred Hitchcock or Rod Serling worthy masterpiece; the characters, the story, and the atmosphere to back it all up. It&#039;s all there. <br />
All Higurashi needs is an audience. <br />
<br />
<br />
tl;dr<br />
<br />
+ Dark, twisting narrative<br />
+ Great, compelling characters<br />
+ Detestable villain that you can&#039;t help but sympathize with on some level.<br />
<br />
+/- Lack of ultraviolence? (see above)<br />
<br />
<br />
Recommend?<br />
<br />
Ab-so-lute-ly. If you&#039;ve not seen Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and are reading this for some strange reason, please, go watch the original- you owe it to yourself to see a show of this caliber, because there aren&#039;t many of them. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;My will will weave an absolute future. No one can hinder me or overthrow it: even fate is up to me to decide, with my unwavering, absolute will.&quot; -Miyo Takano<br />

    Being able to sum up the story of Higurashi in less than a chapter of writer is impossible. Being able to explain the story of Higurashi? Even more impossible. Which gives it that feeling of, &quot;I have to keep watching on too understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
I felt as though I got to grow with the characters in Higurashi, I got to feel the same exact emotions they did. I got to laugh and cry with Higurashi. It&#039;s more than just a bunch of lolli girls, or even a bunch of physco lolli girls. The plot is knee-deep and wonderful. The different emotion you get to feel with Higurashi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review28158">
        is beautiful. The action, blood, gore, romance, pretty girls... etc... you don&#039;t find it all packed into one anime often. With the exception of Elfen Lied.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, I wish I could have watched other anime before Higurashi, because now everything else just seems like a big dissapointment. <br />
<br />
The only thing I disliked about the anime, was that it&#039;s hard to follow. People might watch the first five episodes, and be mad, because they have no clue what is going on. *cough cough* me *cough cough* But I think it was the sneaky way of getting people to watch the next episode.<br />
<br />
And I would like to wrap up with the comparison of the two similar animes, Higurashi and Elfen Lied. To me, Elfen Lied was well written, there was great art with emotional scenes. But Higurashi was amazingly written, with beautiful art, and scenes you could connect with. Scenes where you can say to yourself, &quot;I feel that/I feel bad for that character.&quot; Elfen Lied was great, but Higurashi walks on water next to it.

    If you have not watched the first season (Higurashi no naku koro ni), this anime is practically useless and the same goes for this review.<br />
<br />
Wow! Higurashi no naku koro ni Kai was a great addition to an already very good season one. As I found season one rather interesting and enjoyable, Kai was a must watch for me, in the hope that it would be just as great. With many questions left unanswered, Kai primarily focuses on answering questions and revealing to us the &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; truth. There are a lot less gore and horror elements compared to the first season, as Rika becomes the main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9666">
        point of view. The introduction of a new character called Hanyuu was certainly an interesting add into the plot. Her introduction into the story was done smoothly but it is likely that you&#039;ll ask &amp;quot;Where on earth did she come from?&amp;quot; at first.<br />
<br />
As Kai is a continuation of the first series, the chain of mysterious deaths continues on from Rika&#039;s point of view. The first episode of this season kinda acts as a recap and a look into at the aftermath of season one&#039;s last arc. It then moves into another arc, raising some questions but answering many, and by the end of the first arc, I&#039;d say it&#039;s almost impossible to not continue watching the rest of Kai. The other two arcs finally give us answers to those questions that remained. The telling of a certain character&#039;s past in the beginning of the the third arc really unraveled the mystery and told us the cause and effect. It&#039;s what makes Higurashi a great story, how the answers are not force fed to you, but instead rather open for interpretation; whether the judgments the characters make are truly right or wrong. How some of the little things can make huge differences, and change the outcome of the future.<br />
<br />
A stellar performance by Tamura Yukari playing Furude Rika! The voice acting by her was just amazing (I just love Rika&#039;s scream in episode 8!) and should be highly commended, along with all the other seiyuus! Rena&#039;s voice is more consistent this time, and Horie Yui&#039;s performance of Hanyuu was cute! I have absolutely no objections to the wonderful musical score by Kawaii Kenji, along with another great opening theme by Shimamiya Eiko, and the closing theme which all were very fitting in both lyrics and music. HUGE improvement in the animation! The faces and characters are not as exaggerated or contorted as the first season. It is much more consistent, detailed and kinda makes the characters a little more prettier... <br />
<br />
I do believe that the introduction of Hanyuu was certainly necessary, although whether she had to be that &amp;quot;moe&amp;quot; is a little questionable to me. There were large developments in some of the supporting characters such as Akasaka, Dr. Irie, Takano, Tomitake and Satoshi which were vital to the storyline. The only thing is, the concentration on the development of these characters kinda left the mains Rena, Mion and Shion out for a while...<br />
<br />
Higurashi just had to go to my favourites list! To me it was such a great story with amazing music and voice acting and very interesting and complex character personalities and relationships, with touches of humour here and there. Although the ending is a little lame, well for me at least, it still deserves an overall 9.5 out of 10. Definitely enjoyable and an interesting ending scene. I&#039;d certainly recommend this to anyone! I wait in anticipation for Higurashi no naku koro ni Rei and Umineko no naku koro ni in the hopes that the creators can continue to make such amazing stories!

    Personally, my favourite kinds of stories are the ones that really make you think. Ones that make you look back on what you&#039;ve already seen, and realize there was more going on than you had initially picked up on. Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Kai makes you realize that the entire first season was preparing you for the story it has to tell. <br />
<br />
The first season of Higurashi is fantastic in its own ways. It&#039;s unique in the way it tells its arcs; but it leaves the viewer questioning what they each have to do with one another. The second season, Kai, answers every single

          <span style="display: none;" id="review185734">
        question you could have asked, and also adds multiple layers that you didn&#039;t realize were even happening. It is the most satisfying psychological story I have experienced in a very, very long time. In terms of story, it is possibly the most impressive psychological story I&#039;ve ever seen - its internal logic is consistent and wraps up in a way that leaves you with no lingering questions. <br />
<br />
Arguably one of the most successful parts of Higurashi is its characters. The characters are the story, and the story is what matters. Especially when taking the first season into account, each and every character is given proper time &amp; weight. You understand their backstories, their fears, their traumas, et cetera. They even introduce a new character in Kai that, honestly, makes the whole series make sense. Without this character, the show couldn&#039;t wrap up as fantastically as it does. <br />
<br />
Though I&#039;m praising Higurashi a lot, that isn&#039;t to say it is without fault. The animation can be a bit lackluster at times, and the little I heard of the English dub was aggressively awful. With that being said, I felt the Japanese voice acting was actually fantastic, and the fansubs for the second season were adequate (some awkward phrasing, but they&#039;re fansubs haha). As for the art, I never felt the faults in art ever detracted from the show, and there were many moments of beauty in terms of art - I enjoyed it all.<br />
<br />
By the way, the soundtrack to Higurashi is wonderful! It uses its themes appropriately, and the production on the music never feels cheap. It is a triumph along with the story, and added a ton of depth and emotion to impactful scenes. <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t recommend Higurashi enough. I&#039;ve watched the entire series three times now (first time on my own, second two times with different friends) and always catch something new with each watch. It is a show that is firmly placed in my personal Top 3, and it would take something truly incredible to move it from that spot for me. Higurashi is completely worth your time, and it comes with a heartfelt recommendation from me!

    For years I thought that Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, and it&#039;s sequel, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai were among the best Anime I had ever seen. This is in fact the general consensus, that Higurashi is an amazing Anime and it has garnered much praise over the last few years. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m here to tell everyone that I, and everyone else, could not have been more wrong about the Higurashi series. When you look at it on it&#039;s own, you may see a wonderful story full of drama, comedy, suspense and mystery, but in actuality, you are only seeing a small portion of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32500">
        story.<br />
<br />
You see, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is adapted from a Visual Novel, and for years the English speaking Anime community didn&#039;t have any way to read it, since it wasn&#039;t translated, so they knew of the Anime (and perhaps the Manga), but had never read the VN. But now the VN is completely translated and can be read by anyone, and it should be read, because after I completed the VN, I realized just how bad the Anime adaptation really is.<br />
<br />
To put it simply, the Anime adaptations of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, and it&#039;s sequel, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai, are a travesty. Roughly 1/4 of the entire story from EACH arc are cut completely, and there are numerous other changes and cuts from what they DID manage to include in the Anime adaptation.<br />
<br />
This adaptation is virtually devoid of the superb character development and storytelling present in the VN, not to mention cutting vital clues that prevent the mystery from being solved. In fact, some people don&#039;t even realize that Higurashi is a mystery at all, most people think that it&#039;s a suspense or horror series, a series about &quot;lolis killing people&quot;, when in fact it is a mystery meant to be solved, as well as an emotional drama that the Anime completely fails to capture.<br />
<br />
In fact, I would almost say that the Anime of Higurashi isn&#039;t an adaptation at all, but a joke that DEEN created to make fun of the original material and showcase their own inability to create a proper adaptation. Some parts of the series don&#039;t even feel like the same story because so much is changed and cut, and though you may not notice these issues when watching the Anime by itself, by reading the VN it is made clear just how little DEEN actually cared about this series.<br />
<br />
Putting the hackjob of a story adaptation aside for a moment, let&#039;s talk about the other aspects of the series. The original VNs had a spectacular soundtrack, especially Kai&#039;s, but DEEN decided to just remove ALL of the VN music and replace it with much worse music, often opting to just keep things silent half the time anyway. In fact, the ONLY good part about the Anime, and by association, the only bad part about the VN, is the character design and animation.<br />
<br />
If you have watched the Higurashi Anime, you have never experienced Higurashi. You essentially wasted your time watching it because you missed huge chunks of story and character development, and if for some reason that doesn&#039;t bother you, then you are an idiot and should go back to watching your Naruto crap where you can turn off your brain and not care or notice that the story is shit. <br />
<br />
If it bothers you that you&#039;ve never truly experienced Higurashi, or you&#039;ve never actually watched the Anime in the first place, I strongly urge you to read the Visual Novel, and forget that the Anime even exists.<br />
<br />
Oh and by the way, the Umineko no Naku Koro ni Anime is shit too, that doesn&#039;t exist either, read the VN.

    WARNING: MY FIRST REVIEW ON THIS WEBSITE, I MAY BE A LITTLE BIAS<br />
<br />
&quot;Paranoia Strikes Deep&quot; - Buffalo Springfield <br />
<br />
I love this anime so much it hurts. It nails every aspect of paranoia that I loathe and forces me to contemplate and relish the decisions I&#039;ve made in life. <br />
<br />
I am going to leave out specific characters or story lines as I want to keep this as general and cerebral as possible. <br />
<br />
I have never seen an anime do what Higurashi has on so many levels. It dives straight into this mentality of paranoia which most of the main characters in the show will eventually succumb

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332311">
        to. Next is the subtle and not so subtle references and scenes of mob mentality. I always loved to compare Higurashi to an old American series by the name of The Twilight Zone (1965)! That&#039;s right I&#039;m going old school. There&#039;s a great episode by the name of &quot;The Monsters are Due of Maplestreet&quot;. Now, I won&#039;t give away the ending of the episode as it indirectly relates too well to the origins of Hinamizawa Syndrome. The Twilight Zone also explored the ultra paranoid, especially given the era (Cold War). I Highly recommend to anyone who sees this review to check out the episode before watching Higurashi. The imagination of the creators had amazing views on that kind of mentality before creating the series. Oh, I forgot to mention the ultraviolence and gore. Not only does it score high points for Paranoia and Mob Mentality, but the sheer terror and shock levels as well. Higurashi is not just another Psychological/Horror anime... It&#039;s the standard for me when rating other anime, before or after the show&#039;s original airing, in the same category. <br />
<br />
                     Can it hold a candle to Higurashi?<br />
<br />
It is possibly the best adaptation of a Horror Turn based Video Game?!<br />
Maybe I&#039;m going overboard, but every time I re-watch it I look for new reactions from the characters who by the way get small arcs exploring and embellishing their paranoia and mania. (The Question and Answer Arcs) Only in Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai do we see the entire story fully circle round in a spectacular finale! <br />
While shows like Serial Experiments Lain, another masterpiece, explore what does and doesn&#039;t constitute reality, Higurashi takes envy, hatred, love, betrayal, and every other sin of ours you can think of and delivers a performance you won&#039;t soon forget. <br />
The first series can be confusing at times, but remember that it was based on a game and there are more question than answer arcs so bear with the confusion as all your answers to the first series will be answered in this one. <br />
I&#039;m going to end it there. I have so much more to say about the show, but let&#039;s leave that for the discussion boards where spoilers aren&#039;t as big a deal...Mmmk?

    Television has brought back murder into the home - where it belongs.<br />
~Alfred Hitchcock, 1969<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a rare occurrence when an anime (or any TV show) is able to hold thrill and fear in a perfect balance. For starters, the show has to reach a certain standard of quality in order for the viewer to feel either of those two emotions, but in addition, the series must be able to switch between excitement and terror with ease. But maintaining that equilibrium is in fact possible, and such is the beauty of the Higurashi world as a whole.<br />
<br />
Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni Kai (Often abbreviated Higurashi Kai) is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review188083">
        the second installment in the Higurashi set, and  the predominant purpose of this anime is to provide resolution for some of the unanswered mystery arcs in its prequel, Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni. Many people review the two shows as a single anime, which isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing, but I don&#039;t have any intention of merging two full-length anime into a single, 50-episode conglomerate.<br />
<br />
That being said, I&#039;m going to assume you&#039;ve already seen the first season of Higurashi, because if you haven&#039;t, you should probably watch that before considering Kai.<br />
<br />
Anyways, let&#039;s get get on with the review.<br />
<br />
~the STORY~<br />
Many people (myself included) were left somewhat unsatisfied with the closure of the first season. It just begged too many questions that were left unresolved. How could such adorable, innocent schoolchildren become psychotic killers at the flip of a switch? What were the unforeseen consequences of each killing? And mst importantly, who was the grand mastermind behind the murders of Showa 58? As the only two who have witnessed the endless cycle of June 1983 and as the only two who know the truth behind the shrine god&#039;s curse, Furude Rika (nipaa~) and her celestial companion Hanyuu take the reins as the main characters of Higurashi Kai as they venture to expose the true cause of the murders, and more importantly, how to escape from the endlessly repeating vicious circle.<br />
<br />
It is impossible to sum up Higurashi Kai&#039;s plot in one word, but if I were to try, I would say it&#039;s  &quot;satisfying.&quot; Over the course of 24 episodes, the viewer builds a powerful empathy and love for Rika and Hanyuu. Watching them struggle, watching them uncover dark secrets, and watching them have a good time in the game club all helps to increase this feeling of devotion for the main characters. Thus, each time they overcome a major obstacle, it is immensely gratifying. This is a device used in many popular mystery books and movies, but I have to say: It works quite well.<br />
<br />
~ART &#039;n SOUND~<br />
Most of the time, I put art, animation, and sound into three different categories. For this anime and this anime only, I will group them because they all contribute to a feeling of uneasiness the viewer will eventually develop. The art perfectly portrays cutesy middle/high school students running around, playing games, and having fun, but it portrays each character&#039;s psychotic side equally well. An ambient soundtrack further enhances the suspense between what feels like a high school rom-com and a free-for-all killing spree.<br />
<br />
~them CHARACTERS~<br />
Another qualm I have about the first Higurashi series was its total lack of any kind of character development, with the exception of Shion and Mion. Each character gets a lot more depth in Kai, and characters with less significance in the first season (such as Satoko&#039;s uncle and Miyo Takano) are expanded into major importance.<br />
The only negative remark I have to say about the characters, and the only negative remark I have to say about the whole series in general, is the unwavering resolve of each character. Nobody really changes over the course of 24 episodes, so people became somewhat predictable. But each character is explained in such depth, I could probably forgive it.<br />
<br />
~Higurashi Kai: OVERALL~<br />
This is the rare breed of anime that almost touches absolute perfection. If you haven&#039;t seen this yet, watch it now!<br />
<br />
One of only three anime I have ever given a perfect 10/10.<br />
<br />
