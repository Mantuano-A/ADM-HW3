    [Note: This is a review that encompasses my feelings towards the entire series including XV]<br />
<br />
Meteoroid falling, burning, and disappear, then...<br />
In the distance, that day when the star became music...<br />
Believe in justice and hold a determination to fist.<br />
By shedding many tears, the reality you face is<br />
Create a history, with a light God could not know.<br />
<br />
What is Symphogear? For the longest time I&#039;ve never bothered engaging myself in this franchise. I never understood what is was, and I was naturally repulsed by all things mecha. Now that the series is having its final season and its a dry season, I decided to finally give in and give

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318545">
        Symphogear a try from the very beginning.<br />
<br />
I wondered how have I missed out on the Anime of the Decade all these years.<br />
<br />
I honestly didn&#039;t know what to expect watching the very first episode knowing absolutely nothing about the franchise. The show toyed with my emotions so much in that opening setpiece. When Kanade bit it I thought would be a grimdark Madoka ripoff ended up being one of the most life-affirming shows out there. A stunning display of idiocy and action that is both charming and captivating. It&#039;s confident in its strengths and parades its weaknesses proudly, a show that is both all style and all substance.<br />
<br />
But most of all, it&#039;s a true roller coaster of emotions, and I don&#039;t use that term lightly. I laughed, I cried, I got frustrated at the ineptitude and stupidity of both the characters and the creators, but most of all, I loved. When the curse of Balal fell in place, songs still managed to bridge that gap and connect us all together.<br />
<br />
The one emotion the series never fails to deliver is Hype. The surge of adrenaline and endorphins and all those chemicals in your brain whenever something awesome is happening onscreen is a rare treat in most other anime, but a constant occurrence in this series. The hype does occasionally fail to deliver, the heightened expectations can sometimes be too much, but still, when you hear Hibiki scream DATOSHITEMOOOOOO, you know she means business and join her in song.<br />
<br />
And those songs are precisely what keeps Symphogear in the minds of many all this while. I&#039;m not an idol anime person, I despise most idol anime and yet. And yet. The moment I hard Gyakko no Flugel for the first time right there on the idol concert, I was enthralled. I knew that regardless of how the series turned out, it would have great music. Covering many genres, the series has a diverse palette of songs ranging from Hibiki&#039;s celtic rock to Tsubasa&#039;s enka-inspired tracks, there&#039;s no shortage of variety. Yes there are songs that don&#039;t work well, but the ones that resonate far outweigh the occasional crap Ignite remix or whatever. XV is no exception to this, and, this is a rarity coming from me with regards to this series, but I actually fully enjoyed the OPs AND the EDs this time round.<br />
<br />
The plot and story are fairly typical, but they feel like they belong in a JRPG. Every beat you&#039;d expect is there, mini boss, dungeons, rivals, all those stuff. It&#039;s not particularly fantastic, but it works well. Not surprising seeing as Kaneko was a JRPG writer. <br />
<br />
More specifically for XV, XV is mainly about redemption. Not just about the characters, but also in a meta sense. I certainly have had my gripes with GX and AXZ being particularly weak, but XV comes along and somehow redeems them both in my eyes and I just can&#039;t hate them anymore.<br />
<br />
Symphogear has to be taken in as a complete package. It truly is more than the sum of its parts. Looking back, yes I can agree on all the flaws (some major) the series has had. Yet in spite of it all, across 7 years and 5 seasons. It&#039;s why I ultimately decided in awarding it with one of my rare 9s. Something this special, this inspirational, this long-lasting is truly an experience to behold. For better for worse, it is the definitive anime that represents the 2010s. It may not have ended in the way I wanted, and it may not have that one kiss I was looking for, but it filled the hole in my heart, and with it ending, the gaping wound in my soul may never heal. <br />
<br />
Maybe, for now at least, I can say that the series ended with dignity. It wasn&#039;t perverted into a zombie franchise like Madoka or Fate, nor did it stumble hard in its final moments and is struggling to reclaim its past glory like Nanoha. It has its shortcomings, but thinking back, the journey to the end has been a satisfying romp throughout. <br />
<br />
So what is Symphogear? It is a mecha-mahou shoujo-idol hybrid anime. It is Mizuki Nana&#039;s autobiography. It is an anime about fisting. It is 5 seasons and 7 years long and has captivated the hearts of many.<br />
<br />
But most importantly, it is Believing in the Song of your Heart.<br />
<br />
9/10<br />

    “Kohinata Miku, you’re my sunshine. I feel warmest when I’m next to you, and I’ll always come back to you. It’s always been that way, and I’m sure that it’ll stay that way.”<br />
<br />
Symphogear is a series that’s not for everyone. In the words of ANN’s Nick Creamer, it’s “a singing idol mecha yuri romcom battle melodrama with JoJo&#039;s sense of irreverence and a lot of fanservice,” and that amalgamation is no doubt going to scare some people off. But considering that this is a review of the show’s fifth season, I’m assuming that everyone reading doesn’t need to be convinced that this combination is actually

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318541">
        the coolest thing ever. And given that, rather than asking how Symphogear compares to other anime, I think the more important question is how XV stacks up against the other seasons of Symphogear.<br />
<br />
So then, what are the makings of a good Symphogear season? Through careful research, I’ve narrowed it down to three factors: coolness, escalation, and gayness. As a series, Symphogear is constantly punching past the limits of its internal plausibility, and it gets away with it because it does so confidently and with style. And somehow, it manages to continue to top itself with each consecutive season. And most importantly, it does all this without ever losing sight of its emotional core. I think the best seasons of this show are the ones that have maximized these elements, so let’s see how XV compares.<br />
<br />
In regards to our first criterion, Symphogear has never been cooler. XV is the final season of this franchise, and the Symphogear Project team didn’t pull any of their punches to make sure that it got the ending it deserved. There&#039;s a tangible passion behind every moment; the transformation and fight scenes are the franchise’s best, and basically every other episode was stunning enough to be the finale of a lesser show. What’s more, there’s a lot of fanservice in the form of callbacks to favorite characters from previous seasons, which helps to cement that this really is the end.<br />
<br />
Managing escalation can be difficult after five seasons. It’s important to continue to raise the stakes so that there’s still tension as to whether our heroes can prevail, but after you’ve already punched God, it’s really hard to do that without moving too far into the realm of abstraction. Fortunately, XV’s writers understand that even when it seems like you’ve reached the top, it’s still possible to escalate past that by changing the focus to more personal conflicts. Like sure, the fate of the world is on the line again this season, but Hibiki is fighting to save something far more important: her wife.<br />
<br />
Through all of the twists and turns that this series has gone through, the one constant has always been the bond between Hibiki and Miku. Despite that, Miku has far too often been relegated to the sidelines in past seasons, so I’m glad that the final season was created with this relationship at its core. These two have been through too much over the course of this series, and I hope they&#039;ll have the chance to be happy together after everything is over. They’re so soft.<br />
<br />
So Symphogear XV succeeds in all of the criteria I put out at the beginning of what constitutes a good Symphogear, but honestly, those are all arbitrary and don’t really matter. I could spend the rest of my life identifying factors and trying to explain why those are what make Symphogear work, but I think its essence is one that ultimately escapes explanation. It&#039;s not a perfect series, but it&#039;s one that is always unabashedly itself, and at max volume. It’s brought so much joy to both fans and staff alike, and though I’m sad to see it go, I’m also so happy that it even existed in the first place. Symphogear will always be special.

    Now, if you&#039;re reading this you&#039;re either a Symphogear fan like me or someone completely clueless, wondering &quot;why the hell is this thing rated so high?&quot;, &quot;why the hell is this literally nothing anime topping the charts of Summer 2019 for almost every week?&quot;. Hell, at the time I&#039;m writing this, it&#039;s even in the top #50!<br />
<br />
...If you belong to the latter, then this spoiler-free review about the series as a whole is for you!  <br />
<br />
With one of its taglines being something as cool (and dumb) as &quot;Believe in justice and a determination to fist&quot;, this show&#039;s gotta be good, right?<br />
<br />
YOU&#039;RE GODDAMN RIGHT IT

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318914">
        IS. It’s got magical girls that kick ass, it’s got catchy as hell songs, it’s got concert choreography better than idol anime (and hell, even better than /real/ concerts), it’s got M A R T I A L   A R T S, it’s got toku references, it’s got mechs, it’s got giant monsters, it’s got gay rights AND isn&#039;t subtle about any of these! <br />
<br />
tl;dr WATCH SYMPHOGEAR IT&#039;S GOOD<br />
----<br />
Now, let&#039;s go to the basics. What the hell is Symphogear? I&#039;m gonna try to explain it as simple as I can: It&#039;s an over-the-top show about magical girls punching the shit out of monsters with mecha fists while singing songs LIVE.  Basically it&#039;s like if you&#039;re watching some hot-blooded shonen anime alongside Precure, Kamen Rider and also Gurren Lagann all at once. If that&#039;s still not enough to convince you then I don&#039;t know what will.<br />
<br />
Jokes aside, it&#039;s... exactly that. I know that sounds like an abomination of mix-and-matched genres at first, but trust me - Symphogear makes it work in the coolest possible way. Like its main character, God bless her, Symphogear is a show that always punches through its limits, and it does so in such a stylish and confident way that it&#039;s hard to not accept it. <br />
<br />
But that doesn&#039;t mean Symphogear is all style and zero substance. No, it&#039;s all style AND all substance. Great animation and amazing fight scenes aside, Symphogear is a roller coaster of emotions. I rarely, almost never, get moved to tears while watching stuff, but with Symphogear I&#039;ve lost count of how many times I&#039;ve shed tears. Either from the hype, the heartwarming scenes, or the legitimately sad ones... This show punches your heart HARD with a fist full of feels, covering the entire spectrum of emotions that a human being can experience. It&#039;s just THAT good. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s get to the story. The plot is pretty typical - it&#039;s not anything groundbreaking, but it&#039;s nothing repetitive either. It /is/ dumb, for sure, but in a good way. It is, however, carried by the amazing character writing. I don&#039;t wanna spoil anything, obviously, but this show really goes out of its way to make you like every single one of the characters. The character development is also plain to see with each new season, and goddamn does it feel good to see your faves growing up as you continue to watch the show. You will cry with them, you will laugh with them, and you will love them in the end - even characters you thought you wouldn&#039;t like at first. <br />
<br />
Symphogear is pretty heavy on the music theme, and it shows. That said, it also delivers in the music department. I mean, freaking Nana Mizuki sings the openings. This show also has the best use of character songs out of any other anime I&#039;ve seen in my life. I mentioned this earlier, but the characters sing their songs live during battle. As in, the songs they play aren&#039;t pre-recorded! You can hear their voices crack a bit when they take a hit, or you cry tears of hype when one of the girls just freaking screams the lyrics of her character song as she delivers the final blow to an opponent. With such great usage, there&#039;s also a variety of genres that the songs come in, each character having a unique one. From Celtic music, to traditional Japanese music, to techno darkwave, there&#039;s a lot of variety in here. Not all of them works, obviously, but most of the time they do and it freaking slaps.<br />
<br />
All five seasons of Symphogear cannot be rated individually, they have to be taken in as a whole. Yes, it&#039;s flawed, season 1 especially, but that&#039;s the toughest obstacle you have to overcome and power through. It&#039;s a slog, sure, but everything beyond it is so, /so/ worth it. Besides, whether something is a flaw or a strength, a curse of a blessing, that just depends on how you view it! But it&#039;s undeniably true that Symphogear has a strong message to convey, and it presents that message in such an entertaining and engaging away that it&#039;s hard to turn your eyes away from the screen even for a split second. <br />
<br />
XV is the final season, and while it didn&#039;t exactly give me what I wanted, ultimately it was a satisfying journey - one that I highly recommend to other people. If you&#039;re a fan of the magical girl genre or shows about Karate Bugmen, then that goes double!<br />
<br />
Fun fact: The only reason I decided to pick this show up was because a friend of mine promised to give me 60 bucks if I did. But you know what? Symphogear is worth way more than a mere 60 dollars. It&#039;s... an experience that just can&#039;t be valued in money. It&#039;s an amazing experience I urge you all to try.

    &quot;Even if that&#039;s true&quot; -Hibiki<br />
<br />
That phrase, every time I hear that damn phrase in hibiki&#039;s annoying voice I just wanna take a gun load it with explosive bullets and shoot myself. After torturing myself through 65 episodes it finally comes to an end. It should be obvious I am not a fan of this series. With that said I do think this is the best season yet. <br />
<br />
However it&#039;s still by no means a good series. Throughout all the bs plot devices and cringy twists that they throw at you that seem to come out of nowhere it&#039;s hard to find anything good in this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318574">
        series. I will say the music is good, and the transformation scenes  are amazing to watch and fun as hell. One of the main reasons I did not like this series or any of the series in general is because I knew nothing was gonna happen of importance. The only time I was actually hyped was when hibiki&#039;s arm was gonna be bitten off, but then she just regrows another one. Even in this series, Carol&#039;s minions make a cameo to help her out, they were just used to stir up hype and be used as fodder for Carol to make it to were she had to be. Many things like this happen throughout the series of convenient bs that just appears outa nowhere. <br />
<br />
I will say the main reason I liked this season better was because of the villains. This time they weren&#039;t overpowered at the start and then through the power of the series ending the main character end up beating them at the end because they need to. They were weak. They were getting whooped by the main characters. When they did lose or win it made sense, and seeing them grow in the series was really fun to watch. Beside that though everything else was still really bad. The plot twists were not exciting everything just felt dull and bland. <br />
<br />
When it comes to the characters I can&#039;t say I like them at all. Especially Hibiki, though I did like Maria and Kirika at the very least. They were all one dimensional, stereotypical, and boring. I don&#039;t wanna shit on them to much mainly because I care to little for them anyways to want to do that.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, there was really nothing of value I found while watching the 65 episodes this series has. There are a few good merits this series has but it was not worth the watch. If you can make it past season one and enjoy it I think you will honestly love this series, so give it a try if you haven&#039;t already, you&#039;ll either hate it or love it.

    Huge Symphogear fan here, so don&#039;t expect a very unbiased review. Although I can&#039;t imagine why you&#039;d be watching season 5 of Symphogear if you didn&#039;t like the first four unless you&#039;re one hell of a completionist or are being forced to watch against your will (which isn&#039;t an entirely unrealistic scenario given the intensity of Symphogear fans when trying to get others to watch).<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
The story of XV is more of the same yet completely unpredictable because &quot;more of the same&quot; in Symphogear means more batshit insanity and over-the-top action and badassery. Without spoiling too much, we get new villains this season who somehow

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314625">
        tie back to villains and characters in previous seasons in some way shape or form but have their own unique and independent motivations for trying to stop the Symphogears. Much like in AXZ we get a set of three rival girls who it&#039;s hinted aren&#039;t actually as evil as some of the crimes they&#039;re being made to commit and may eventually befriend the protagonists. This is pretty par for the course in an action-packed magical girl show. Other than that, there&#039;s not much more I can say without spoiling anything or not knowing what the hell I&#039;m talking about. I don&#039;t watch Symphogear to analyze a deep story, I watch it to get hyped up and I honestly don&#039;t care if things don&#039;t always make sense or the story has some asspulls. Symphogear is pure hype and insanity and best just to go in with the mindset of being along for the ride.<br />
<br />
Characters: 10/10<br />
The main 6 Symphogear users and supporting cast are already well established from previous seasons. As with previous seasons, each of the girls will get her own battle song and they&#039;ll use the power of friendship and stuff to kick ass. Side characters continue to do their jobs like Genjuro providing occasional comic relief. It looks like Miku might possibly be playing a bigger role in this season than previous ones, but that remains to be seen.<br />
<br />
Art and Animation: 10/10<br />
This is an easy 10, Symphogear from G and onward has always been one of the most visually impressive shows when it comes to well-animated action sequences. You can feel the power and intensity behind each and every one of the characters&#039; attacks and the fights are always well-choreographed. The transformation sequences in this season are hands down the best magical girl transformations I&#039;ve ever seen, topping even the amazing transformations in previous Symphogear seasons. Watching them gets me hyped up and makes the girls look like they&#039;re ready to kick some serious ass. <br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
The music in Symphogear is still fantastic and the girls&#039; songs always provide a fitting soundtrack for the insanity happening on screen. As usual, if they get hit or have to put a lot of energy into an attack while singing, you&#039;ll hear it in their voice. Only reason sound isn&#039;t a 10 yet is because I haven&#039;t heard a song yet in this season that I&#039;d put in my top 5 Symphogear songs. Maybe one of them will grow on me or a new one will blow me away but right now there&#039;s nothing to rival my favorite songs from GX and AXZ in this season. I also really miss the ignited arrangements and it looks like we won&#039;t be getting any of those from this season either.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
Symphogear is the most hype, most badass anime I&#039;ve ever watched and so far XV hasn&#039;t let me down one bit.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
I&#039;ve never given a 10 to a not yet done airing series before but I have tremendous faith in Symphogear as I&#039;ve given three out of four of its previous seasons a 10 (GX got a 9 for being slightly slow-paced by Symphogear standards but I still loved it. Also note that slightly slow-paced by Symphogear standards isn&#039;t slow-paced by normal standards in the slightest).<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re a Symphogear fan, there&#039;s a very high chance you&#039;ll love this season as much as the previous ones. If you&#039;re not, then you&#039;re probably forcing yourself or being forced to watch Symphogear anyway at this point and I can&#039;t stop you, so why bother? If you haven&#039;t watched Symphogear, go start with season one right now to see what all this hype is about and if the show&#039;s for you!<br />
<br />
Symphogear is my favorite action anime of all time and it hasn&#039;t let me down yet when it comes to providing pure badassery and insanity (with the bonus of featuring cute girls as protagonists and having some yuri-shipping bait on the side). If you feel even remotely similarly, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s going to be letting you down this season either!

    The shortest and fastest route, straight ahead!, In a straight line!<br />
<br />
LA FUCKING LOVES Symphogear and what a way to go out, Game of Thrones&#039; Final Season WISHED it wanted something like this...<br />
<br />
Senki Zesshou Symphogear&#039;s FINAL season and LA is still sad that this series is ending but nonetheless goes out with a bang, righting wrongs from previous seasons, culminating everything from it&#039;s previous seasons and tying up loose plotlines in making this final season all the more worth it to this end making it not only LA&#039;s favourite anime of Summer 2019 but to this franchise to one the greatest animes of all time (no

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318567">
        seriously).<br />
<br />
See LA only got into the Symphoghear series about 3 years ago when it BARELY known, but quickly over G, LA really got into Symphogear with GX being a stumbling block but still having it&#039;s batshit craziness, it wasn&#039;t until AXZ that LA was in deep in Symphogear, heck because of it, LA played XD Unlimited (the mobile game and STILL plays to this day) and with XV tying EVERYTHING together while servicing the fans with crazy scenarios that they wanted for YEARS, this final season REALLY drives home how far the Symphogear franchise has gotten to, it&#039;s an underrated Fool&#039;s Stone but DAMN does it pack a punch when it delivers!<br />
<br />
Nuff reminiscing, so XV as a final season wraps up everything the previous 4 season culminated in, everything from the Curse of Balal, Tsubasa&#039;s family issues, the newly notion of not only Hibiki but Miku being cleansed of the curse and ABLE TO HOUSE THE POWER OF THE GODS because of it and all the while the Symphogear team needs to deal with the remnants of the Bavarian Illumanati, Noble Red. The first thing to note is that Tsubasa&#039;s family issues with her grandfather was hinted at multiple times in previous season finally comes into the forefront and we see both a regressions and progression to Tsubasa&#039;s character development and it&#039;s not to knock it on Tsubasa&#039;s regression as it brought up Tsubasa&#039;s worries and &quot;duty&quot; over to the forefront as a result, how it was handled was..uhhh aggressive to say the least. The entire deal with Hibiki and Miku being cleansed with the Curse of Balal after Tsubasa&#039;s arc (though they are both in tandem with each other) afterwards becomes the central focus and MAN does the plot twist it gives us changes everything about Hibiki&#039;s mantra of &quot;to the fastest route, in a straight line&quot; with how complicated Hibiki&#039;s arc gets, it&#039;s still something fans wanted, just not in the way they wanted but nonetheless. The Curse of Balal or more or less get full world building from what was hinted at in the first season and obviously becomes a HUGE plot point latter on. The only character that really didn&#039;t get character development this season was Chris and LA thinks it&#039;s mostly because her arc was already resolved in AXZ and this season wanted to tackle the rest of the cast that still had lingering plotlines and yes Chris IS still LA&#039;s faovurite character from the series and her not getting enough screentime is COMPLETELY ok, considering how batshit crazy this season gets with it&#039;s cliffhangers and plot twists, THOSE sufficed.<br />
<br />
Now for the villains for this final season, well we have Noble Red, three Alchemists wanting to get their human bodies back and their under the command or a certain bastard father....yeah Tsubasa&#039;s father Fudou hired them. Now Noble Red themselves aren&#039;t exactly &quot;noble&quot; as they are actually weaker than MOST of the series villains and thus they use trickery and deception in their fights, the worst example being Millaarc voiced by Aimi Terakawa and she HEAVILY gives Tsubasa Cerberus Syndrome as a result of her presences, like Millaarc is an interesting villain, LA just didn&#039;t like her tactics. Elsa voiced by Kana Ichinose and Vanessa voiced by M.A.O were cool and were nice contrast to Caglistro and Saint-Germain from AXZ though out of the three, LA liked Vanessa the most. Fudou&#039;s purpose was the conflict and regress Tsubasa as a character but also the pinnacle of resolving the entire issue with Tsubasa&#039;s crazy family dealings, LA hated the asshole let alone his plans were wonky as hell in his extremist nationalist ideals and to this end, he was probably worse of a villain than Adam was, maybe the worst villain of the series, heck even Dr. Ver had SOME sense of dignity. Now for the &quot;final boss&quot;, well without spoilers, it&#039;s actually the perfect wall for Hibiki to NOT be able to punch through let alone the final boss brings in plot elements from not only previous seasons but gives the leeway for other underdeveloped main characters to the forefront, mainly Maria , the aforementioned Tsubasa and Fudou who set it all up and Hibiki (since her involvement was slimmed down from AXZ, fighting NOT withstanding). But much like the Bavarian Illumanati, Noble Red for the most part were a nice dragon to the ACTUAL final boss as well as their notions of wanting to be human...Millaarc....ehhh she was fine.<br />
<br />
Plot twists, man to say that they brought plot elements back and MADE IT AMAZING for this season is an understatement and LA mainly says this for GX, since even LA had problem with that season but XV remedied it as well as the previous seasons (G for it&#039;s moon, AXZ with somehow bring back Saint-Germain and the first season with the Curse of Balal to be brought in more detail) in the most batshit crazy Symphogear way possible. GX got most of the redeeming treatment, from Carol, the Autoscorers and heck they even brought back Hibiki&#039;s father and actually showed that he&#039;s developed out of his asshole father phase and he started being a father to Hibiki!, the rest of the seasons more or less got cameos and callbacks and everyone of them were gloriously done. Nonetheless like SYmphogear&#039;s style with plot twists and cliffhangers, THEY DO MAKE sense and only drives the plot to even crazier and crazier scenarios. The callbacks don&#039;t even feel like it was pandering to us, as it was more like they wanted to give what the fans wanted all the while solidifying and making the story better in being just Symphogear. LA says this as they DO gives us what the fans what they want, but Symphogear does it in the most awesome but blindsided way possible while giving it that Symphogear flair to it. The plot twists and callbacks were fucking amazingly done. <br />
<br />
The animation once again done by Satelight is GODLY to say the least, everything from it&#039;s addrenaline-music-fueled fight scenes the updated character designs, it being even more bloodier than before and in the backgrounding even. Seriously Satelight gave it their own with XV, even to the point LA seeing this rivaling David Productions&#039; Jojo works or a Bones work. Yes there are the few rare derps but once again it just can&#039;t compared to the heart and soul the animation was taken overall...it is seriously GODLY animation, excellent work Satelight. LA KNEW you&#039;d obviously could do it and for a last hooray for the series, even better.<br />
<br />
Voice acting?, well does LA REALLY need to say?, well give Aoi Yuuki the MVP of the season and LA&#039;s favourite seiyuu of Summer 2019, with her focused and honed shouting, Nana Mizuki gets an standing ovation with her much more dramatic tone as Tsubasa and let alone her singing the OP Metanoia, just DAMN, Yoko Hikasa as Maria as result of Tsubasa&#039;s arc get something similar to Nana Mizuki and heck even Yuka Iguchi gets to show her multiple cadences thanks to the huge plot twist of the season and man it shows in this season even more so. Another standout is Misaki Kuno as Elfnein and Inori Minase as Carol gets her time to shine as well. Add in Yoshino Nanjo and Ai Kayano as Shirabe and Kirika on comedic relief duty and they both still have great cadences (especially Ai Kayano). Hell add in Noble Red&#039;s voice actresses of M.A.O, Kana Ichinose and Aimi as Vanessa, Elsa and Millaarc all have their major strengths, form Aimi really reveling in her smug genki-ish cadence to M.A.O being really moe even as a villain to Kana Ichinose being the calm and collected sisters to Elsa and Millaarc while also having that trickster cadences coming through to Vanessa as a character. Seriously much like it&#039;s animation, the voice cast just gets even better to GODLY status.<br />
<br />
And yes on speaking of the OP, the OP was great and easily took LA&#039;s favourite OP of Summer 2019 and maybe for the year, showing off it&#039;s the final season. To the ending being an impactful farewell sung by Ayahi Takagaki. THIS IS SYMPHOGEAR so it&#039;s a no brainer that LA would gush about the OST and most if not all the insert songs and music in Symphogear was GOD tier with Nana Mizuki and Ayahi Takagaki as always making both OP and ED&#039;s GODLY. Essentially if you want Aoi Yuuki, Yoko Hikasa, Nana Mizuki, Ayahi Takagaki, Ai Kayano, Yoshino Nanjo, Yuka Iguchi and Inori Minase singing their bloody hearts out while fighting let alone the awesome OST from their discography added along with the singing. Symphogear is GOD Tier anime music.<br />
<br />
To say that the majority of this season gives us cliffhangers upon cliffhangers as well as situations that becomes REALLY hard to get back to normal, great resolutions to the majority of the casts that also callbacks to the previous seasons and even giving us one the largest plotlines to rest, Symphogear XV is at it&#039;s best to say the least especially for a &quot;Final Season&quot; and for going out like a bang that it did, the moniker as &quot;Final Season&quot; is apt and impactful.<br />
<br />
The finale, well AXZ&#039;s was great in impact and foreshadowing, while GX and G&#039;s was it in scale, but XV?, well...it brought the small scale, but large impact of AXZ while bringing in the absurdity of G and GX&#039;s final fights all into one AND THEN they went over to an eleven heck TWENTY with it&#039;s finale, this finale was utterly glorious and stands for what Symphogear is, if there is anything Symphogear does right it&#039;s is climactic final fights and finales in general and this finale definitely delivered in all it&#039;s glory!<br />
<br />
Too say that Symphogear finished that way or not, LA IS sad that Symphogear is finishing but it needs to end to make this finale last, instead of going on forever so LA sees that sentiment and by all means XV went ALL out this season if LA&#039;s praying to the Custodians instead proof enough. But what a way to go, from that little anime about mecha girls beating the crap out of Noises with plenty of melodrama, into an anime where mecha girls beat the crap out of a power hungry corrupt GOD with Sentai references.<br />
<br />
Symphogear as a franchise was just a rollercoaster of a ride in ALL forms of batshit adrenaline pumping awesomeness and craziness is just an understatement but LA said this in LA&#039;s Jojo&#039;s Part 5 anime review, but Symphogear is one of the current animes to achieve the status of being one of the animes that was utterly jawdropping and stunned and just constantly wanting and waiting for more episodes, heck not only that but Symphogear&#039;s discography were such earworms they even became a staple in LA&#039;s daily life in listening to the Openings and endings (and some of the batshit crazy battles) on a daily basis (no seriously). Symphogear may be ending but as LA said again...no matter what, Symphogear was a bloody great, no GODLY anime. <br />
<br />
Maybe a movie but if Symphogear ends here LA is wholly, far exceedingly satisfied with XV nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Symphogear is anime, Symphogear is music itself, Symphogear is life, Symphogear is GOD...LA is gonna fucking miss ya...<br />

    THIS REVIEW HAS MILD SPOILERS FOR SYMPHOGEAR XV.<br />
<br />
Senki Zesshou Symphogear the final season, XV. If I had to describe this season in one word it would be disappointing.<br />
<br />
I came into the 5th and final season of XV very excited as the advertisement and teasers made it seem like it would be this amazing new season that broke the norm for Symphogear and deliver an epically told story. With Miku also having an obvious focus in this season I was really excited because she&#039;s been neglected since season 2. However all my hopes we&#039;re quickly and utterly crushed. The HibiMiku we were promised and the HibiMiku

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318610">
        we get were two HUGELY different things and its the greatest disappointment of the season.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with the characters. Noble Red (The main enemy) was very weak in my opinion (not in power, as characters). They didn&#039;t show much differences between already established villains and everything they did or motivations they had were pale in comparison to villains who were much better such as Fine (At least in my opinion). I feel Symphogear has always had a villain problem and it continued down a spiraling path of them becoming worse and worse each season. XV just marks the next in line to be even worse than the last. Hell, they even just take the backstory from the previous season villains of the Illuminati and put it on the current season ones. Well, Milaarc did her role of making us hate her so she&#039;s managed to be the first person in Symphogear ever to make me genuinely hate them (Apart from Akira). Another HUGE disappointment was Fudo. He was introduced as this man that had loads of power and could threaten S.O.N.G easily and was very manipulative to get his way and protect the country. Then they just said screw that and ruined his character. Such ruined potential for an interesting villain who was different from the rest. His previously established information like &quot;having a stronghold over the government&quot; was also abandoned but I won&#039;t spoil how. Fudo as a whole was a huge waste of precious time that could have been spent on more important issue XV has. I honestly think Noble Red should have been axed from the planning board as well. Every second spent on them was an utter waste of time they could have spent on more important issues. The season is already rushed as it is so it could really use the extra screen time wasted on characters who are literally just the &quot;seasonal redemption sticks&quot;. They don&#039;t feel compelling in the slightest and they could have been replaced with literally anything and could have still got the same effects that XV apparently needed. Hell, they could have just introduced the main overarching villain much sooner and had way more screen time with them instead. That would have seriously helped all the issues its had for me personally.<br />
<br />
Noble Red&#039;s &quot;redemption&quot; was also really quick and made no sense. It was literally there just to tick off a box on the checklist. Now, this isn&#039;t a spoiler in the slightest. We all know they were going to get redeemed just like every other season of Symphogear ever. You know by episode 3 it&#039;s going to happen. There hasn&#039;t been a single villain who wasn&#039;t redeemed in some way other than Adam. I&#039;m sure Tsubasa will magically forgive Milaarc for all she&#039;s done right? Yeah as you can tell I hate both Noble Red and even the idea of them being redeemable. I know people talk on and on about they&#039;re being redeemed because there&#039;s &quot;no one truly evil&quot; or something like that and the message the director wanted to tell but seriously can Symphogear have a single season where they don&#039;t have a redeemable villain. They&#039;re all made to die in the end anyway so just make them hateable as hell. The Rising of the Shield Hero knew this perfectly and made you genuinely want for Malty to be defeated. I&#039;m not sure why they didn&#039;t go down this route for Noble Red instead. The second I saw they were taking it down the normal redemption path they have every season I immediately rolled my eyes and knew this was just another average Symphogear season. The main overarching villain also completely breaks character at the end for no apparent reason which ruins a lot.<br />
<br />
The main characters returning are the same as ever. However, with character arcs for Symphogear, I genuinely believe they are just repeating arcs. This season it didn&#039;t feel like any character went through any type of arc or grew much at all. Of course, some characters have to be taken off the focus per season because of there not being enough time to properly develop them but even the ones that do get focus didn&#039;t feel like much. Tsubasa&#039;s entire arc this season felt very forced. Tsubasa has had the same concern for 3 seasons now, and the way they rap that up? They repeat her arc from season 1 about loss and anger. I won&#039;t say how but admittedly the initial plot twist was interesting however it genuinely felt pointless to me. Honestly so disappointing because it was interesting that they added this new seriousness to the series way above previous seasons but they don&#039;t stick with it unless its a Tsubasa scene. Tsubasa basically takes up half of the season so it&#039;s annoying to just see season 1 play out again and take up more screen time from HibiMiku. I like Tsubasa getting a focus, just not what they give her. Making Tsubasa a focus was a good choice character-wise considering she was the original Symphogear (Not including the immediately killed Kanade). Because of this we finally get to see Hibiki and Tsubasa&#039;s friendship put at the forefront and redeveloped a new so the two become even closer and trust each other even more. It&#039;s beautiful honestly, definitely one of the saving graces of XV. Tsubasa and Hibiki have my favourite friendship in Symphogear so seeing it put to focus was a great treat. It&#039;s just a shame that Tsubasa isn&#039;t given an interesting story outside of the same state she&#039;s in for 2/3 of the season. As for other returning characters Maria X Tsubasa fans are in for a treat with this season having half of it focus on them and half focus on Hibiki X Miku. Focusing on two major couples was good as previous seasons didn&#039;t do this that much and it gives more screen time for them. Even if its just screen time and nothing else.<br />
<br />
Now to talk about the supposed main focus of XV and my biggest complaint that ruined it for me, the main story, Hibiki and Miku. I personally watch Symphogear only for these two, so when I saw the teaser and the news that this season would focus on them I was hyped as hell. Sadly as the first few episodes got along I got very worried that they were just feeding us one scene an episode and saying &quot;Look they&#039;re the focus&quot;. Sadly they did exactly that. After some issues with Miku, she is removed from the series and is never seen again until the end. We get one occasional scene of her talking but that&#039;s it. Hibiki herself also doesn&#039;t seem as emotional as I thought this season to what&#039;s happened during it (I won&#039;t say what but you can probably guess from previous seasons) outside of one scene that was well done. It feels that Hibiki was too busy with other conflicts to actually focus on the more important one to her. Again maybe it&#039;s just a matter of they don&#039;t have enough time to properly make this story compelling or just never tried to. However, I&#039;ve got to give props to XV in how they&#039;ve improved their facial expressions and reactions giving way more emotion to the characters than ever before. However, the supposed marketing of HibiMiku being the focus is essentially a lie. I&#039;d say Tsubasa feels more like a focus than the relationship between Hibiki and Miku. They were even on the cover of this season as well so it sucks to see them not get a good engaging story as I hoped. They just get drip-fed a scene per episode for the first half and the conflict isn&#039;t given the direction to truly be impactful and engaging. There aren&#039;t any impactful moments between the struggles of Hibiki and Miku to overcome because the season has to focus on other characters as well. Tsubasa&#039;s arc this season majorly takes away from it which sucks since her arc is just a repeat of season 1 which annoys me, even more, to see that get focus over HibiMiku. The stuff in G was way more interesting than what XV has managed to achieve (Which literally is just the conflict from Symphogear G just dragged out longer). They don&#039;t really build much up but instead put problems on hold and make it seem like they&#039;re building it up and much of XV is rushed and when they finally get around to the problems they are resolved in an instant. The main problem once they start addressing it is resolved in half an episode. HALF AN EPISODE!! When I say it doesn&#039;t feel built up it&#039;s not that they don&#039;t have enough screen time (Not mentioning the less Miku gets later on) but it&#039;s about what the characters do. Hibiki and Miku genuinely feel like they&#039;ve just been given a shitty script to read out and that&#039;s it. The main overarching villain for this season doesn&#039;t feel like a rival to Hibiki. Every season there has been a great semi or full rivalry for Hibiki to either defeat or befriend. I think Adam and Hibiki is a good example with what he did to make Hibiki angry so when they finally fought it felt satisfying and carefully built up. They also had multiple engagements before the final fight. Sadly Hibiki has next to no encounters with the main villain at all and it isn&#039;t given the time or focus to be an impactful rivalry for Hibiki to defeat. Adam also got much more screen time than this season&#039;s villain did to focus on who is eventually going to be the main threat. Adam&#039;s fight in AXZ was given a bare minimum of 3 full episodes, whereas this season&#039;s villain gets one episode. Actually not even one, they get HALF AN EPISODE!! For the final fight of the series!! I can&#039;t stress that enough how insulting that is that the main villain of the franchise gets half an episode to fight the heroes and is resolved in an instant making it unsatisfying when they finally defeat them. This is odd considering they did the other seasons just fine but when it came to their final season they rushed it so much. Hibiki also only has one motivation to defeat the main villain outside of the typical &quot;I want to destroy the world&quot; villain motivation that every villain has. It sucks because that one motivation is definitely enough if they made it more engaging and directly reminded us of it and had more encounters with the overarching villain. It just doesn&#039;t feel like Hibiki is desperate enough this season. That&#039;s what I mean when it&#039;s not built up so when the main problem is resolved it doesn&#039;t feel satisfying in the slightest as all it did was take away from HibiMiku in favour of a predictable story. Especially when they chose to focus on the overall villain later on rather than Miku. I&#039;m a HUMUNGOUS HibiMiku fan so the disappointment was also humungous when I saw the final product. The supposed main focus, Miku, doesn&#039;t get any spotlight whatsoever even though she was foreshadowed at the end of AXZ to have a major role. No, her major role sums up like this, a plot convenience, That&#039;s it. Just a plot convenience to have the story continue. Its a shame too because the HibiMiku scenes we get drip-fed throughout the season aren&#039;t even that great with most of them saying vague stuff to build up foreshadowing that&#039;s obvious what&#039;s going to happen from a mile away leading back into predictability. Expect to be sorely disappointed if you were expecting anything with sustenance with HibiMiku this season. The ending of XV was equally as disappointing as it was the most rushed thing I&#039;ve ever seen. It&#039;s surprising how they tried to make up for the lack of Miku in the last episode and try to think that it resolves all the season&#039;s issues of ignoring her. Miku is definitely my biggest complaint with XV. One last comment on HibiMiku, they do some vague stuff towards the end which is frustrating because they&#039;ve been building up Hibiki and Miku&#039;s &quot;feelings&quot; for so long but XV NEVER ADDRESSES THEM!! They literally just leave it up to the audience for them to guess what their &quot;feelings&quot; are. I&#039;m not sure whether this was just to satisfy those who aren&#039;t into the yuri side of Symphogear but I wished they&#039;d just embrace that side that so many love about the series and go full in. Not getting an answer to something this built up was just insulting. In this particular case, it&#039;s not even about the payoff being bad, THERE WAS NO PAYOFF!! Being a huge HibiMiku fan you can expect that sort of reaction from this cop-out.<br />
<br />
Apart from the Hibiki and Miku stuff, the overall story of XV was very underwhelming and didn&#039;t feel like a final season. I see a lot of people say &quot;Symphogear isn&#039;t about the story&quot; but I personally really would like to see Symphogear improve in that regard. So when I saw the teasers I genuinely thought they were doing exactly that, giving us a good story. However sadly everything about the story except one saving grace was very disappointing. Symphogear XV started strong very early on but it never managed to elevate it up and when they built something up it ends up being so anticlimactic right after the initial surprise that it makes you wonder why you were hyped in the first place. This season has so many good ideas just they fail to make them interesting and you see the most impactful scene of the season early on making everything else bland in comparison. Symphogear XV was amazing at raising expectations with its foreshadowing, teasers, and previews to each episode but horrible at meeting them almost as if they were doing it on purpose. There just wasn&#039;t enough payoff for what they were building up which resulted in more disappointment. The thing XV does over and over again is, introduce something great or amazing, then immediately forget that amazing thing happened or don&#039;t use it much afterward. The main thing about XV is expectations, and personally, that was the death of XV&#039;s potential to be an amazing final season for me.<br />
<br />
On the more positive side for HibiMiku they at least did get more coverage than previous seasons. When they aren&#039;t being ominous and spouting out foreshadowing they have some really nice scenes of being more light-hearted than the season surrounding it to give us a little break to just enjoy the slice of life elements that Symphogear has given each season. They had to obviously remove most of the slice of life parts because of the new seriousness so there isn&#039;t much but the parts we do get are nice. If you only care about just getting HibiMiku scenes then XV has got you covered with you getting at least one per episode for the first half of the season. Sadly later on its neglected in favour of the main story which greatly differed from what I&#039;d hoped. At least they do try to give Miku something towards the end. And I mean right towards the end, the last episode.<br />
<br />
Kirika and Shirabe this season are basically just used as the comedy machines the entire 13 episode duration. I didn&#039;t find any of it funny but I&#039;m sure fans of those characters will love it. It felt a bit forced at times with them making stupidly bad jokes at a supposed serious moment coming back to that bipolar tone shift. It makes me want to go and just watch a series that focuses on one or the other. Being a comedy or being an action. Or even in some cases both like previous seasons of Symphogear itself. This season Kirika and Shirabe are glued together as usual so don&#039;t expect any individual character stuff with them (But I guess the season isn&#039;t about them so it doesn&#039;t matter). I personally think they should just rotate main character roles so have Kirika and Shirabe nearly removed and become side characters so they can focus more on Tsubasa and Maria or Hibiki and Miku. This is one reason I didn&#039;t like the introduction of Maria, Kirika, and Shirabe as main characters. It spreads the screen time over more characters and means they don&#039;t get as much depth to them. Or at least that&#039;s how I see it. Luckily they at least limit non-important characters to just battle scenes so, for the most part, they do focus on their main story parts. Mainly Maria and Tsubasa actually getting more time then Hibiki and Miku. Especially towards the end which should be the vital moments in the story. As you can tell I didn&#039;t like Tsubasa&#039;s arc and story this season as it was just a repeat of already done arcs and felt like a waste of time. It wasn&#039;t the fact they made Tsubasa a focus that annoyed me it&#039;s just what they chose to do with her that was pretty boring to watch again after already seeing a similar thing in the past.<br />
<br />
However, outside of Kirika and Shirabe&#039;s forced comedy, there were some funny scenes with Hibiki and her reactions to certain situations. However, the comedy occurs while in front of the villains so that makes me question whether XV wants to tell a serious story or just be funny.<br />
<br />
Foreshadowing for this season, in my opinion, was a double-edged sword. It did its job of getting us thinking about the future early on but when the foreshadowed thing happens and passes the immediate aftermath is so disappointing you feel stupid for actually expecting anything. The only thing that keeps you going and excited is the cliff hanger that every episode ends on. I&#039;m not sure whether there was one episode in XV that didn&#039;t end on a cliffhanger. A bit annoying but it did its job of keeping me coming back for more. The foreshadowing did its job successfully but it comes back to the payoff not being enough. They&#039;ll foreshadow something to happen so you get excited, the scene happens and it&#039;s amazing, the immediate scene afterwards disappoints you to no end and makes all that build-up to become void, and repeat throughout the entire season.<br />
<br />
Now the overall saving grace of XV is, of course, the main overarching villain. OMG, I LOVE THE OVERALL VILLAIN FOR XV! I can&#039;t mention names or anything as it would be a major spoiler but I&#039;ll just say without the main villain this season would be pretty lackluster and very forgettable. This season&#039;s villain is the villain I always wanted Symphogear to have and the villain I expected Fudo to be. The main villain remains interesting and keeps the same attitude of you wanting them to be defeated without them going psychotic and ruining their character like Symphogear loves to do. I can&#039;t talk much about them since its a major spoiler so I&#039;ll just say if you&#039;re watching XV expect a great overall villain. However, that same villain is at the same time a disappointment of XV, because of course everything to do with the main story has an element of disappointment. As a character they are the most interesting Symphogear has ever offered, sadly they ruin that by giving them zero screen time to actually do anything. They were introduced earlier than I expected which got me excited as I thought &quot;Oh this is new. So we&#039;re getting more of the season with this to develop this out&quot;. NOPE. Right after the typical Symphogear cliffhanger, they are taken out of the spotlight again. Funny, just like Miku is this season. Honestly, that was one of the greatest disappointment I&#039;ve ever seen in anime. To make it worse they do practically nothing the entire series. They wave their hands a bit and uses their power occasionally and that&#039;s about it with the odd 1v1 fight that lasts 3 seconds. Such a shame. They even did an interesting turn with Noble Red and the overarching villain in which I thought &quot;Oh this is cool. I hope they use this as some sort of message.&quot; NOPE. They immediately reverse any consequences and continue like normal. They even remove the villain just as disappointingly and ruin the character they built up in the last few seconds they got on screen. Just for the sake of it. However overall I think they did an amazing job on their overarching villain for this season in which they are now my favourite Symphogear villain, just slightly beating Fine who has been my favourite the entire time. They don&#039;t feel much more powerful than previous villains but their attitude definitely strikes them apart from those who came before them. I&#039;d love to say in-depth how much I love this season&#039;s villain but sadly as said before they&#039;re a walking spoiler.<br />
<br />
Now for my next point, predictability and repeating stuff. Symphogear is no stranger to being predictable and repeating elements but after 5 seasons it&#039;s really starting to annoy. They have to have 3 main villains, they need to have them be redeemed, they need a bigger villain so the smaller villains can turn to the good side. It&#039;s basically them repeating the same story structure each and every season for part of the story. Cant they spice things up and change the story structure up a bit? Maybe have fewer villains this season that are more fleshed out than usual to make it a more compelling final season? Having less villains would also mean more screen time for the heroes and hero vs villain interactions for more buildup. Seriously, having fewer villains this season would help XV SOOO MUCH! In my opinion, the main overarching villain should have been introduced sooner than they did. They aren&#039;t given nearly enough time and more importantly not enough interactions with the heroes to really care. Miku&#039;s involvement could have also seriously benefited from it as well. They do try and change the structure by introducing an unexpected element early on in the season but then they just kind of never use that interesting element and just drag it out so it doesn&#039;t get resolved until the very end anyway. After watching Symphogear for so long and loving the series for so long seeing the same elements over and over again does start to get annoying. I still think the previous seasons are pretty solid its just XV which disappoints in comparison. Ok, one, the power-up this season wasn&#039;t explained in the slightest. I&#039;ve seen many compare this season&#039;s power up to Ignite and most said they preferred Ignite and for good reason. Ignite was built up, introduced properly and tested by the heroes to overcome something to gain that power boost. But in XV they just said &quot;Nope!&quot; because screen time I guess? They just introduced this power with no introduction whatsoever and just were like &quot;Yeah, Hibiki has this thing, we&#039;re not going to tell you how or why. Fill the dots in with your own theory.&quot; The powerup this season is basically purely just for a nice spectacle to look at to make the characters look nice which I&#039;ll admit it at least does that. But it&#039;s just another tick on the box. Another annoying thing that makes XV uninteresting and frustrating is their for some reason obsession of keeping the three villain formula for the main villains and one bigger villain for everyone to turn against later on. It makes it predictable on where the story is going, what twists the villains will have throughout, when and why the villains turn sides, etc. It just makes everything predictable and meaningless particularly for the last few episodes which suffer from this the most. It&#039;s literally just seeing a reskinned version of the villains from AXZ and G just with slightly different motives but their end destination is obvious from a mile away so you never care about what they want and why because we know what their ultimate fate will be. The reason season 1 was so interesting for me was because its the only season of Symphogear that didn&#039;t have this predictable formula and since it was the first season we were just introduced to this new series. Yes, there was Chris as the villain and Fine as the bigger villain but it was handled so much better than XV does it. Especially because they didn&#039;t bombard us with tons of villains so they were able to focus more on a select few. Chris was also an interesting villain, unlike Noble Red. No matter what people say about the art style, season 1 still remains the best in my opinion. I seriously think they shouldn&#039;t have even made Noble Red so they don&#039;t have to waste time building these character&#039;s personalities, motives and things they do if their ultimately going to contribute nothing to the story that the ultimate villains of the season couldn&#039;t just do themselves. And after 5 seasons you get sick of seeing this same formula. After about season 2 we all know nothing bad will happen to the heroes and any attempt at making us worry for their safety is made void as we know for a fact that none of the heroes are ever truly in any danger which is another element that adds to XV&#039;s uninterestingness. Because of this, they need to make something else compelling other than the threat of the hero&#039;s lives. XV attempts this, I guess, but never succeeds to meet expectations. Especially when XV focuses so much on heavy drama involving the main characters but for me it never really hits. I personally couldn&#039;t care less with the drama this season as it just felt unnecessary and forced. Especially in Tsubasa&#039;s case.<br />
<br />
The fights this season, for the most part, aren&#039;t particularly special, pretty standard Symphogear. The villains abilities were sadly pretty lackluster for the most part. HOWEVER, some of the later scenes in the series are BEAUTIFUL, the animation and voice acting this season has genuinely made some epic scenes that left a grin on my face. One of the later fights varied up the combatants and gave us something not seen before which was a really interesting fight to watch. As well as some of the overarching villain fights also having some interesting events that make them stand out to the rest of the average fights. Hibiki gets some amazing scenes herself that I sadly can&#039;t say but look forward to some epic Yuki Aoi/Hibiki screaming towards the end. Symphogear XV definitely enhanced their fights with the beautiful animation to make even the normal Symphogear fights have this feeling that you&#039;re watching a piece of art that people have put their utmost effort into making which I can really appreciate now more than ever. You can tell that all the staff and people involved have poured their hearts into making XV as good as it possibly can which is beautiful to see. It&#039;s just a shame the writing team couldn&#039;t give us a compelling story to truly make this a masterpiece which it definitely had the potential of being. If I was rating Symphogear XV solely on the effort put in, animation and voice acting it would easily be a 10/10.<br />
<br />
One huge problem that I have with XV is the number of times they make a callback or direct reference to previous seasons. It feels like they had at least 3 references per episode which made it difficult to ignore. Somethings from previous seasons make an appearance (I won&#039;t say what for spoiler reasons) and play a fairly decent role in the plot which I&#039;m conflicted with. I&#039;d like XV to focus on what it&#039;s doing rather than reference back to what it&#039;s done in the past. It was too much to ask for from a 13 episode season and they spend too much time using the copy and paste button. Hell, they even make a joke about the secret to Alchemy being copy and paste. It sucks because by episode 4 these callbacks seem just for fan service and not there for genuine reason. One of the major plot points is just ripped from season 1 and made grander for more impact. I&#039;m sure some will say its just paying tribute to previous seasons and bringing it full circle but its difficult when they have so many. Too many callbacks and references to previous seasons for my liking. But I guess its just fanservice for the mega fans.<br />
<br />
I expected a lot from the final fight of XV as it is the building up of 5 seasons of the story to finally end it all with one big boss fight. Sadly the only powerup people get is a slightly different version of things used in the past, A LOT. The final fight as said before was only half an episode. When something feels this rushed and crammed into the end it just makes it even more unsatisfying. Adam&#039;s fight was 3 episodes, Carol&#039;s fight was more than 2 episodes, Fine&#039;s fight was also multiple episodes. Why they chose to cram the very final boss into such a tight screen time baffles me! They either should have cut content that was unnecessary like the jokes (or most of Tsubasa&#039;s whole arc in my opinion) or to be honest Noble Red as they weren&#039;t an essential part of the plot and it would have been just fine without them. That or make XV longer with more episodes to tell a completely satisfying story. The 13 episode per season rule seems to have been part of the reason XV felt so crammed together, at least for me. X-Drive is used every season up until AXZ which was a very interesting scene when something else was used. Thing is though X-Drive was only cool the first time, in season 1, with the best scene in the series (and in my opinion the best scene in Symphogear) when they activated their first X-Drive and Hibiki screamed &quot;SYMPHOGEAAAAAR!!!&quot; at the top of her lungs in epic fashion. They use X-Drive in this season (I won&#039;t say when) but it was used unexpectedly so I had high hopes that meant they were going to do something unique for the ending, sadly they didn&#039;t. It&#039;s strange to see them suddenly absolutely drop the ball on their final season with 4 other seasons to refer back to. However, the very little time we do get for the final fight is nice with us finally getting to see Hibiki go one to one with the main villain but sadly it&#039;s cut short as its resolved in an instant because of it all being crammed into the final episode. Also, the fact that Hibiki has had near to no encounters with said villain makes it feel like just their first fight and not the final fight of the series. The visuals for this final fight are phenomenal though and look gorgeous the entire fight. It&#039;s just a shame it felt so rushed.<br />
<br />
Now on a positive note, something that Symphogear XV undoubtedly improves on is its animation. This season has some of the smoothest and BEAUTIFUL looking animation in the series to date and not only the best in the series but some of the best this anime season. Give a quick scene of XV to a non-Symphogear watcher and I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll impress them. This amazing animation will definitely help in promoting Symphogear with the amount of coverage XV has gotten. As previously mentioned the facial expressions and reactions of the characters in the season feel more emotional and help you empathize and make them feel more human (Of course I&#039;m not saying they weren&#039;t human before just more so now than ever). The reactions from characters this season are much more impactful than previous seasons and it works well with its new serious scenes when they keep the comedy out of them. They use this with some of Symphogear&#039;s cliffhangers which had me on the edge of my seat wanting to see what happens next. Some of the later scenes in the series have such good animation you&#039;d think they spent their entire budget on that one scene but they keep bringing them out constantly keeping that high production value. Some shots looked weird but that&#039;s only if you pause the screen so its nothing that takes away from the experience. The character designs look great. I prefer previous season designs but there&#039;s no denying that the designers did a great job with this season&#039;s character designs with darker/stronger colours this season compared to previous ones. The later outfits are also as equally beautiful making you look at them and go &quot;Wow that&#039;s pretty&quot;. Hibiki&#039;s winter outfit looks great as well with her snowflake sweater. Miku&#039;s outfit was also a direct reference to her Alter counterpart in the XDU game which was a nice touch. Miku also gets some other outfits that look jaw-droppingly beautiful which genuinely makes me realize how beautiful Miku is. (Of course she&#039;s always been beautiful just more now than ever before) Hibiki&#039;s scarf this season is in the same regard referencing her alter which makes her look badass as hell. Hibiki throughout this season has had many cool and badass moments and looks to show her progression as a character. She looked like a hamster in season 1 but has grown into a lion that is determined to protect her cubs. (This is a weird analogy but I&#039;m rolling with it lol). Tsubasa also has a good focus in XV so we get to see her expressions and what season 1 wasn&#039;t able to achieve with its capacities at the time, really showing the growth not only the series but the studio as well and how they&#039;ve managed to perfect what they originally started. (In terms of animation).<br />
<br />
Now to speak of the music, the big promoter of Symphogear and focus. I&#039;m going to be honest, I&#039;ve never really cared much for anyone&#039;s songs other than Hibiki and Miku&#039;s so I generally just ignored the music for everyone this season as well after I listen to them once.  I feel music is just a gimmick at this point and not a major focus. Or at least for this season, it seems like that. Other than the apple song Maria keeps going on about the original focus of songs saving the world and all about songs have sort of been removed from XV. This is part of the reason why I&#039;m happy Symphogear is finally ending because they&#039;ve in my opinion strayed too far from what was originally good about Symphogear. (Of course, this is just my opinion I know a lot of people are just consuming XV and loving the hell out of it which there is nothing wrong with.) However, I cannot deny how good the OP and ED are for XV. Both of those songs were very rememberable and left an impact. Symphogear has always had a great way of blending their ED out when each episode finishes and that&#039;s no different here. The ending sung by Takagaki Ayahi has that impactful start to finish each episode along with the beautiful visuals that accompany it of Hibiki walking on a slanted floor walking towards a light. The images you see in the ED get you thinking about what could possibly happen along the way which may have attributed to more theorizing and expectations being raised but still a beautiful ED. The OP is equally as great with the fan favourite Nana Mizuki returning for her final OP of the Symphogear series and she doesn&#039;t throw any punches. The OP is catchy and epic, leaving an impact and making you want to sing along. The animation that goes along with the song is also smooth as hell and follows the song greatly. The OP mainly just consists of character&#039;s faces which is a bit of a shame but the song easily makes up for it. I&#039;m starting to understand why Nana Mizuki is thought of so highly after proper listening to this opening song. Everything about this screams amazing! Sadly they didn&#039;t play Synchrogazer which I hoped they would but a certain song from a previous season does make an appearance which was appreciated.<br />
<br />
Along a similar line of thought, I&#039;ve definitely got to talk about the voice acting for XV. The voice acting for XV is BEAUTIFUL! Particularly Yuki Aoi delivering her screams and cries in her usual epic fashion and only improving as the series went on. Some other voice actors manage to change their voice to an AMAZING level. I can&#039;t say who because that in itself would be a spoiler but they do such an amazing job with their role and it definitely left a huge impact on the series. The voice actors for the series have such a good cast of talent. Its one of Symphogear&#039;s major appeals is its voice actors which I see a lot of non-Symphogear watchers say they&#039;re interested to see what Symphogear is like solely because of popular names like Nana Mizuki and Yuki Aoi. Some of the lines delivered in XV have such emotion behind them and you can feel the internal conflicts the characters are going through solely on their voice. Symphogear has come a long way from season 1 and as much as I love that season there&#039;s no denying XV has some of the best elements of Symphogear that have been perfected over the seasons.<br />
<br />
Now, have I been taking this season too seriously, yes I have. However, XV clearly wants me to take it seriously compared to previous seasons. It has way more serious scenes reminiscent of season 1 so I was hoping they could find that perfect balance that season had between slice of life and serious action, sadly it never does that for me. That&#039;s probably the reason I didn&#039;t like this season as much as the others. With previous seasons I could just sit down and consume it. But this season is so serious that I can&#039;t do that and it keeps switching between normal Symphogear atmosphere of over the top action, screaming and Symphogear goodness, and super serious scenes that change the tone drastically. Having to keep changing between these two moods ruins XV. The poor comedy doesn&#039;t help either. I wish they would just choose one side and stick with it for this season. Either be serious throughout the season or be a normal Symphogear season. Yes, I know Symphogear has had serious scenes in the past other than season 1 but just the level that XV has its serious scenes makes it hard to blend the tones between episodes. One episode will be super serious, the next it&#039;s back to normal Symphogear, and repeat. Maybe if I just re-watch Symphogear XV with a completely different mindset I might enjoy it more.<br />
<br />
Now if I just look at the serious scenes themselves they are very well done. Ignoring the switching tones the serious scenes are a lot more violent and brutal than previous seasons with the great animation and art bringing it out to its fullest. With the tone they were hoping for with some of the plot points this season the animation and overall colouring of XV was spot on to create some pretty horrifying scenes. Some of the individual scenes had so much effort put into them and it really shows. There were some seriously well-crafted scenes that just with the right buildup and execution could have made me shed a tear and get emotional for the first time in Symphogear (Other than tears of joy). The expressions that accompany them are also just as amazingly well crafted. It&#039;s a shame because I could see the potential for them to make a genuinely compelling story with this new animation and seriousness. <br />
<br />
Another thing XV does amazingly is its transformation scenes. Now admittedly after I&#039;d seen the transformations once I skipped them every time after that but that doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re bad. I loved the transformations for this season, having some of the best in the series. Hibiki&#039;s had some new camera movement and uniqueness, Tsubasa&#039;s showed some epic visuals, Chris&#039;s also had her own &quot;uniqueness&quot; with the way she handled herself but admittedly I thought it went over too quickly and finally, Kirika&#039;s was rememberable enough for it to get changed lol. If I had to praise XV for some things the transformations would definitely be one of them. Again the animation in this series took a new height with XV so in that sense Symphogear has been improving each season.<br />
<br />
Ok if I&#039;m going to be honest, most of my complaints about XV all go back to the same problem, Miku. Miku was promoted soooo much with XV but she isn&#039;t given anything. Especially with the latter half of the season. So you&#039;ll probably see why I didn&#039;t like XV and found it so disappointing. I&#039;m very attached to Hibiki and Miku so to see Miku get this treatment absolutely sucks. She literally just has some chats through the season and that&#039;s it. Oh, and they bluntly put what character arc they had planned for her out in the open, then never do anything with it again. I think its just because I was watching this weekly which makes it seem like its been longer than it actually has but it genuinely feels like Miku has got so little attention this season than she should have. Later in the series, Miku is nowhere to be seen outside of 2 scenes. It&#039;s such a shame too because in the earlier episodes they built Miku up sooo well with her saying stuff like &quot;What would you do if I caused someone trouble?&quot; and getting a speechless Hibiki in response. But Miku was never given any spotlight herself, its all another thing. I swear Miku got more personal spotlight in G with her gear and her fight than she did in all of XV. Then they tried to remedy this all too late to make up for it. God, I wish I never had any expectations for XV then I could have enjoyed it the same way I did when AXZ was airing. Previews didn&#039;t help much with trying to keep my expectations low.<br />
<br />
Now I say what I want about the whole HibiMiku cop-out of their feelings but the ending scene did have a nice touch to it with it giving us a Miku monologue that directly contrasts what she says in episode 1 of season 1. She talks more positively and to me that has such poetry behind it. She is rehearsing it like a poem which probably makes it like that but Miku is the perfect choice for this so she at least got that beautiful monologue to end the series. Miku started Symphogear, Miku ended Symphogear.<br />
<br />
Final thoughts. Symphogear XV isn&#039;t a bad season per say, just a very disappointing one. XV did bring some amazing things to the table such as its beautiful animation and absolutely perfect songs but overall was very disappointing. As a huge HibiMiku fan I expected so much more from this final season especially with how it was promoted and advertised. Miku was essentially shoved to the side and didn&#039;t get the spotlight she deserved. It did bring some good things to the franchise such as its overall villain but ultimately the story and the plot of XV were a great disappointment. With XV constantly building up a scene only for it to be the most anticlimactic thing ever after the initial reveal ruins XV over and over. I struggled to enjoy this season compared to the rest with how many times it caused frustration. In summary, too much hype and too high expectations. XV knew how to raise the excitement but never knew how to maintain it. They&#039;ll raise the hype then drop it completely when the initial reveal is over. So as long as you have little to no expectations going in I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll enjoy the hell out of this 5th and final season of Symphogear. I&#039;m being hard on this season because I love Symphogear as a whole so it sucks to see them end the series on this.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m personally glad this season is finally over so I can stop complaining about it. I do recommend the Symphogear series up until AXZ as its all a great anime that I highly recommend and would say if you&#039;re going to watch XV just be mindful of your expectations and don&#039;t expect much after the big reveals the season gives as they are horrible at following those up. <br />
<br />
Overall 7/10. The reason it doesn&#039;t dip lower than a 7 is because of my absolute love for the overarching villain keeping my interest and my already large dedication to the series as a whole as well as the little drips of HibiMiku scenes we get along the way and its amazing animation. My experience will definitely be in the minority for the Symphogear community as I know many fans are just excited to get another season and they&#039;ll be very satisfied with this final season. It mainly just comes down to the disappointment of the Hibiki and Miku story we were promised and never got and how Miku was essentially thrown to the side. I guess XV has taught me firsthand how expectations can really break or make a series, and in XV&#039;s case, they couldn&#039;t maintain the hype outside an initial reveal which made XV very disappointing for me. However that ending scene did ease some of my disappointment and really made me realise that this is the end of such a good series which got me emotional.<br />
<br />
Also Kimi Daki Ni I just realized is a continuation of the end credit scene and is a marriage proposal. &lt;3  HibiMiku officially canon and XV saved XD.<br />
<br />
 I&#039;m definitely going to go re-watch season 1 to relive my original Symphogear hype. Absolutely love Symphogear as a whole though and highly recommend it. HibiMiku FTW!!!!!!!!

    I&#039;m gonna use this review to review not just this series, but the entire seasons of Symphogear in general. As I have a lot to say, and if you&#039;re looking at something within the recent anime in the past year or two, and are looking for something to watch. Please watch ALL of Symphogear, and here is why.<br />
<br />
Symphogear covers a lot of ground when it comes to the characters, and this season is no different from the first.  Touching on subjects and having twists that always keep you engaged. Always a good point for a show to keep you hooked, is through it&#039;s progressive

          <span style="display: none;" id="review343828">
        characters, to even 5 seasons in, and there is still so much to take in and enjoy. This is why the plot is always so good and entertaining to me.<br />
<br />
The characters themselves have always been lovely. Miku and Carol are my stand out favorites, but each character is wonderful in their own right. They&#039;re a mix of personalities that all mesh together, to keep the show not only engaging, but it makes you want to root for them. But even on the other end, it makes you want to punch some of them with the shit they pull. It&#039;s like in wrestling, if you&#039;re actually booing a heel(bad person) they&#039;re doing their job right. The same happens here. A good villain for sure. <br />
<br />
The op for sure is lit as hell. I&#039;m gonna be listening to this for years to come, much like the songs within the show in general. Music is always top notch when it comes to Symphogear. The art is also smashing as always too. You cannot go wrong here. Everything looks so well, and looks so well done.<br />
<br />
You&#039;ll not go wrong with this season, and with Symphogear as a whole. Go watch it.

    I&#039;m always astonished at how big of a franchise this actually is. Not many anime series, especially as non-mainstream as this one, can proudly claim 5 seasons over the span of 7 years. Quite impressive for Senki Zessho Symphogear (Symphogear from now on), and that is precisely why, as the third season was airing at the time, I decided to check it out.<br />
<br />
[Review / opinion will cover all Symphogear seasons with really insignificant spoilers - but spoilers are irrelevant for this series]<br />
<br />
At first I had trouble grasping what this show was all about. Death, blood, hatred between cast members, new found powers and some music.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319705">
        An overall serious and why not, edgy, tone that quickly starts disappearing in the following seasons in favor of a more slice-of-lifey nature with a somewhat repetitive yet effective formula. I had the wrong idea, and from that misconception, it led me to put it on hiatus for 2 years after finishing the second season.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m glad that I came back and I&#039;m somewhat sad that it is now supposedly over.<br />
<br />
Symphogear is hard to label within certain tags. The official ones indicate sci-fi, music and action, yet there&#039;s also comedy, mecha, slice of life, mahou shoujo and a spoiler tag for this last season as well. It is important to understand that this is not a battle shonen let alone a show where things follow a logical path or conclusion. This is a hard point of understanding to come to, because of how misleading the first season is. <br />
<br />
What makes this show enjoyable is a combination of everything that constitutes what it is. This anime at some point tried to take itself seriously, but the more I watched, the more I realized that if you&#039;re here for the overarching story, you will probably hate it. Satelight also became self aware eventually and I thank them for that. Shoutouts to the fanbase as well, ever so persuading and incredibly devoted to their singing goddesses.<br />
<br />
So then, onto the actual review:<br />
<br />
SYMPHOGEAR SYNOPSIS:<br />
<br />
One (six) young girl(s) continuously saves the world by using the power granted by ancient relics in the form of shards hanging from a necklace. These rocks react to the girls&#039; singing, and in return provide them with miraculous mecha-like armors that seemingly can increase their power level at will, using it to ultimately defeat the bad guys after having initially lost to them earlier in the season.<br />
<br />
-We have our main character, Hibiki, a girl with a troubled past that invoked the power of deus ex machina from the first episode of the first season! From that point onwards you should know that she&#039;s powerful as fuck, and that she will probably win fights with the flick of a finger... or a single punch if things get too heated. One Punch Woman, if you will. Despite having this serious advantage over others, she often questions whether she should use her gift in battle, because she also enjoys talking a lot, and you can&#039;t really talk while you fight singing.<br />
<br />
-The stoic and serious Tsubasa, a blade with no feelings that sometimes does concerts because singing is her thing.<br />
<br />
-The former enemy Chris, a boyish girl that loves raw firepower and has a backstory that involves losing both of her parents. <br />
<br />
-Maria, one of the main antagonists from the second season, a girl that lost her sister... see where I&#039;m getting at? We have 2 freaking former enemies (so far) as part of the main character cast.<br />
<br />
-Lastly we have Kirika and Shirabe, unfortunately the former didn&#039;t get much of a personality while the latter had half an episode for her development in the 4th season. These 2 along with Maria share the same backstory of being lab rats looking for atonement for what they did.<br />
<br />
-Then there&#039;s Miku, a normal schoolgirl. Hibiki&#039;s best friend just because. The blandest character in the series perhaps as her only contribution boils down to being a damsel in distress and screaming Hibiki&#039;s name very loudly. Oh and she also fights sometimes.<br />
<br />
I guess I should mention that a new recruit and crucial member of the supporting characters is technically the main villain from one of the seasons. You see what I mean yet? This anime rivals DBZ with the whole turning enemies into good guys shtick. This is another reason why you shouldn&#039;t take this show too seriously.<br />
<br />
I mentioned comedy earlier. I legit have a hard time figuring out if most of the stuff I laughed at, was designed with comedic value in mind. All the times 2 of the girls joined their breasts together (with the subsequent zoom-in), all the times one of the girls got knocked the fuck out whilst singing so that her song abruptly stopped, all the times the command center asked themselves in awe about what they just witnessed and someone explained it with absolute certainty, or how about a ninja extending his prowess on inanimate objects... it doesn&#039;t happen often, but the delivery is always great.<br />
<br />
The voice actresses are all big names in the industry, and pretty much all of them have great songs at some point. This is a huge incentive to watch for some as the music is superb and core to Symphogear, and while not every song is remarkable and some are repeated at times, it&#039;s still the driving force of this show. Every opening was sung by Nana Mizuki (Tsubasa), much to everyone&#039;s delight while every ED had Ayahi Takagaki (Chris) in charge. It makes me think the existence of this animation is just as a mean to advertise the vast amount of songs that exist, much like the Love Live anime, and that probably is right and obvious to most, but I don&#039;t know it for sure.<br />
<br />
The animation is excellent as well as the now iconic transformation sequences. Studio Satelight really outdid themselves from the second season and onwards. Character designs are vibrant, the abilities and fighting styles each of the girls (and villains) have is unique as well as their facial expressions. I don&#039;t think I spotted any QUALITY animation frames after season 1 but there probably are some. One minor criticism is how they rehash the transformation sequences a bit too much throughout seasons to skip some runtime, but since they look good I&#039;m willing to forgive them.<br />
<br />
At it&#039;s core, Symphogear is ultimately a show about young girls fighting the villain of the season with the power of deus ex machina transmuted into hype songs. The animation is great, the sound is great, the voice acting is top notch. That&#039;s all it really matters. <br />
<br />
Is it entertaining? Yes it is. <br />
<br />
Will you find several instances where you ask yourself &quot;why didn&#039;t they do X earlier&quot; or a similar sounding hypothetical thought? Yes you will, unless you&#039;re the kinda guy that enjoyed Mirai Nikki unironically and couldn&#039;t physically see anything wrong with it, then you will never notice anything.<br />
<br />
Should you care about this? No. Laugh it off dude, and this is coming from someone that can&#039;t stand asspulls in shows at all. Symphogear makes it enjoyable because of its self-awareness and because the value of the show is located elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Trying to make sense of why stuff happens or how something is solved will get you nowhere. This is one of these shows best watched with your brain turned off, a negative connotation that some anime get; the radical difference in this case is that Symphogear is not trying to be something more than it is. You&#039;re getting exactly what you signed up for (bar the 1st season). That&#039;s not to say things are completely random or 100% make no sense, there is some continuity and reasoning in the way all of this works, it just happens that most of the times it is too contrived and convenient to take as a valid explanation for the events on screen. <br />
<br />
This is -not- a serious anime that failed in its premise and therefore can only be enjoyed with your brain turned off so you can ignore the flaws. This is an anime DESIGNED to be watched with your brain turned off from the get-go. That is a huge difference, and it&#039;s not a bad thing.<br />
<br />
Sit back, and enjoy watching 6 winged angels wreck havoc as they sing the cheesiest lyrics at the top of their lungs. It&#039;s the peak Symphogear experience, and it&#039;s one that I dare say not many other shows can replicate.

    I’ve been writing about anime in various forms for about a year and a half, and it’s been pretty damn hectic at times. I’ve run into a lot of shows that challenged me in a multitude of different ways, moments and stories so jaw-dropping that I felt I could never do them justice with mere words. But there’s an extra bit of irony in that consideration now that I’m finally at the end of Symphogear. After all, this show’s entire thematic point has been about the inability of words to communicate what you’re feeling, and how desperately we fight to rise beyond that limitation regardless.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319420">
        Hell, you could argue that us weirdos who write anime reviews- or any reviews, really- are like gear wielders ourselves, communicating ethereal ideas and feelings and trying to put them in a form that people can understand and relate to. Maybe that’s part of the reason I’ve fallen so head-over-heels in love with it; I know firsthand how difficult the task before Hibiki and company really is. It’s hard to get across what you’re feeling with tools this imprecise, to connect with people when the nature of reality itself keeps us as separate entities. But like the great punch lesbian herself, I keep reaching out regardless, because I know there are feelings well worth sharing and building together.<br />
<br />
And Symphogear has made that task so, so rewarding. This ridiculous, uneven roller coaster ride has been, without a doubt, one of the most worthwhile shows I’ve analyzed since I started a tumblr blog dedicated to this nonsense. It inspires me in so many different ways, even when it falls short of its audacious ambitions. I love its kinetic energy and bombast. I love its unapologetic queer driving ethos. I love its bold-faced commitment to sincerity in the face of all odds. I love how it never stops trying new things, never stops finding new ways to express the countless exciting thoughts bouncing around in its brain. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that Symphogear is one of the most important anime I’ve ever watched in terms of figuring out why I value this medium so much. Even this far into my anime craze, I’m still finding new reasons to love it, new reasons to appreciate its existence. Symphogear’s eclectic mashup of genre and tone could only ever come from the no-holds-barred, try-anything ethos of anime, from a willingness to be as stupid and weird and ridiculous as overblown as you need to be to get such operatic points across with the panache and courage they deserve. In the time since I first watched it, this franchise has come to represent why anime will always be worth fighting for. Any medium that can produce something so singularly worthy deserves to stick around.<br />
<br />
So what do I say now that it’s finally over?<br />
<br />
Well I guess I better start with the only thing that really deserves to be said: Thank you. Thank you, Symphogear. Thank you for one of the craziest, most invigorating experiences of my anime-watching career. Thank you for the ridiculous action setpieces and fantastic animation. Thank you for the stunning performances and killer soundtrack. Thank you for the bravado, the tenacity, the showmanship. Thank you for Kirika and Shirabe. Thank you for Hibiki and Miku. Seriously, THANK YOU for Hibiki and Miku. Thank you for the imagination, the conviction, the heart, the willingness to go above and beyond.<br />
<br />
But above all else, thank you for a finale that I will remember for the rest of my life.<br />
<br />
I cannot overstate what an incredible achievement XV has been. This isn’t just the best season of Symphogear yet, this is the culmination and perfection of every reason why it’s been so worth fighting for. The action is more dynamic and explosive than ever before, with stunning animation that regularly left me gasping in my seat. The storytelling is more thoughtful and resonant than ever before, with story threads and thematic undercurrents that gripped me down at the very base of my soul. The villains are the best villain team yet, posing a legitimate moral uncertainty that makes every clash with them a nerve-biting affair. The spark of understanding has never shone as strongly, with such colossal courage and such meaningful connections to make. Hibiki and Miku’s relationship, taking central stage like never before, only becomes even more beautiful and resonant. This is the apotheosis of everything that makes Symphogear great, every reason it’s been such a breath of fresh air for me over the past months, all delivered in the most rousing opera performance I’ll likely ever see. And if I’m still reeling from the impact tying up this review four hours after the fact, then that’s all the proof I need to stand up and applaud until my hands ache from the effort.<br />
<br />
Because above all else, beyond any points I could make about production quality or storytelling consistency, the reason Symphogear has lingered so long in my thoughts is that this show- this utterly bananas show- is what I want anime to BE. I want every show I watch to be this courageous, this heartfelt, this determined to break every barrier in its path and forge something beautiful through sheer force of will. I&#039;ve compared it to Gurren Laggan in the past, and that comparison has never felt more justified, and that comparison has never felt more true. Symphogear is everything that I wanted Gurren Laggan to be, inspirational on a level that knocks me out of my complacency and convinces me that anything I want to accomplish is within my grasp. It makes me believe in the power of this medium with every confident step it takes. And with XV, it doesn’t just deliver on that promise a thousandfold, it pierces the heavens with that promise and sends it hurtling through space like a rocket-powered ship of dreams, exploding in rainbow firecrackers that spell out song lyrics in their wake. This is every last reason I love anime jacked up to titanic proportions and let loose to stupefy the world with its majesty. I bow before Symphogear with more conviction than I do before Death Note, or Attack on Titan, or My Hero Academia, or Yu Yu Hakusho, or most other big franchises you could name. And if I’ve been able to share even a fraction of its beauty with you over the course of writing about it, then I know its song is still going strong.<br />
<br />
So you know what? Fuck it. I don’t care if Tsubasa’s arc this season was awkward and kinda mishandled. I don’t care if the lore doesn’t make any goddamn sense. I don’t care if this franchise is still chronically averse to the idea of subtlety. The reasons we fall in love with shows don’t come from some objective idea of quality in construction. They come from the connections they forge with us, speaking in a language we can never hope to fully understand, yet still feel speaking to us all the same. And with XV’s colossal finish in tow, I value Symphogear about as highly as I possibly can. I value it for its outrageous entertainment value, for its unyielding spirit, for Hibiki’s gentle fist, for Tsubasa&#039;s iron sword, for Chris’ newfound family, for Shirabe and Kirika&#039;s yin and yang, for Maria&#039;s stoic beauty, for Genjirou’s paternal brilliance, for Miku’s blinding radiance, for one of the single best fictional relationships I’ve ever had the pleasure to experience. This is the reason anime is worth fighting for, writ large in stunning spectacle and a heart that beats louder than any other. Symphogear is good on a level that defies reason, so why bother trying to make sense of it? If there’s one thing this franchise proves, it’s that even when you don’t fully understand, you can still connect more deeply than you could ever dream. And the connection Symphogear has forged with me is one that I will cherish until my dying day.<br />
<br />
So thank you again, Symphogear, for every second of this crazy roller coaster ride. Here&#039;s to all the memories, and to the shining future we reached together, with a light that God doesn&#039;t know.

    (This is for all five seasons)<br />
All anime, really all stories, especially those whose main appeal is meant to be the fights, are simply a premise executed on with a series of tropes and subversions of tropes. It is thus those that have the best premise, but far more importantly those that execute and subvert said tropes the best, that shine the brightest.<br />
And in that regard, Symphogear does one of the best jobs I have ever seen.<br />
Symphogear is a magical girl battle anime with one main hook: the girls have to sing as they fight. What this allows, in its near-perfect execution of this concept, is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review352367">
        a concert of visual and audio, in which the rhythm on the fight perfectly matches the rhythm of the song, the likes of which are seldom replicated.<br />
The result is an even greater capacity to affect the viewer&#039;s emotions and reach new levels of FUCKING HYPE.<br />
The eye-candy and ear-candy themselves are both fantastic. The seamless, beautiful sakuga combined with songs that almost feel wasted having sound effects and dialogue on top of them come together in perfect harmony in order to bring to life stories on a scale spanning the earth, the moon, and all of human history.<br />
The stories followed by each season take the A Certain Magical Index approach of drawing from history and mythology to use as elements and villains. A prime example is the recurring Curse of Babel, from the Christian Tower of Babel story, which is an element in the majority of seasons, including the first and last, both of which feature villains attempting to dispel it. As early as the first season a fragment of the moon is blown up and the moon gains rings, which pleases me because having a fragmented moon in the sky is just something I&#039;ve always loved seeing in stuff. They&#039;ve also got lunar ruins there, which I just love as a concept.<br />
Elements from each season are really nicely interconnected, both obviously and subtly. The threat of each subsequent season is something familiar from those previous, with I believe the exception of GX, which introduces alchemy.<br />
Characters. All of the girls are cute as fuck, especially Yukine Chris; she is the best. And there&#039;s also a lot of yuri which is great to see, even a couple lesbian kisses. But seriously they do actually have internal conflicts and shit that make them interesting and loveable, even the villains. I don&#039;t have much else to say about that fact other than all the stuff with the families is precious. Also precious is the ships; Tsubasa and Maria are a great pair but the connection between Hibiki and Miku is just the thing I love. (But ngl I&#039;d rather see Hibiki and Chris together; they&#039;ve got a thing going on and I like it)<br />
Somehow every season had me fucking hating the villains at the start (especially XV) but they always manage to endear me to them by the end, which they kind of cheat because they&#039;re all adorable girls. <br />
Genjuuro and Ogawa are cool. The two S.O.N.G. guys you constantly see at the computers commentating on battles don&#039;t really have personalities, but sometimes they&#039;ll sneer at something or say something that makes them endearing anyway.<br />
Every episode other than season finales ends on a huge cliffhanger that make Symphogear one of the hardest shows to put down. The transformation sequences/henshin are hands down the best I&#039;ve ever seen, throughout all seasons but especially in XV.<br />
Symphogear is a new kind of musical; a battle anime that has made its fantastic music diegetic, containing five sci-fi plots that occasionally intertwine with daily life; threats ranging from your grandpa to the illuminati to gods, countered by 2-6 lesbians in exosuits who have to sing as they fight. And it is one of my favorite anime of all-time.

    THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER FREE.<br />
<br />
Ah Symphogear, one of the more popular franchises of recent years and a much anticipated final season has come to an end. This review will cover the franchise as whole instead of the final season as I believe there is very little variety as a whole.<br />
<br />
The story is a clear case of good versus evil, rather expected in the genre that is notorious for lack of grey areas, ultimately triumphed over with powers of love, friendship and understanding. It does offer a few side plots as a whole but unfortunately with very little substance and importance to the main plot. As

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319007">
        a positive it avoids an episodic approach and focuses on developing the story as puzzle pieces and this helps for a satisfying ending with decent pace to any of the seasons.<br />
<br />
The art is great - the transformation scenes, which are the combat modes of each character, are exceptional and there is very little detail shared in these scenes among the characters. It&#039;s simply put, the strongest aspect of the series and one that will most likely be remembered and used as a benchmark for similar titles. The combat is quite flashy and dynamic, and character designs are enjoyable.<br />
<br />
The sound department is on a high note as well. From the voice acting in battles, to the quality of battle music. The opening and ending songs of each season have been praised by the community and apparently worthy of a concert overseas from what I heard.<br />
<br />
The characters are unfortunately on a low note. You have a MC that has all the hero complex and the bland lines to push for more in a battle as is with every shounen, her friends that give her courage, the villains that hate the world and how it doesn&#039;t understand them and those caught in between that are mere tools for the advancement of the MC&#039;s power and hold little relevance on the screen.<br />
<br />
Overall, the enjoyment is there, it&#039;s certainly one of the anime that you should give a go when you feel down, if you prefer the genre or just simply have some time for a relaxing show. It has highs and downs, fortunately more of the former in a few seasons, but the series will at least give you some memorable moments.<br />

    After how badly the second half of G, most of GX, and nearly all of AXZ had driven the series into the ground, it seemed unfathomable that the series could come back with enough quality to deserve the hype surrounding this final season. Hilariously, almost like the series&#039; own depictions of super heroes beating impossible odds, the series did exactly that with this season.<br />
Suddenly the characterization is on point, the plot makes sense, the themes are articulate, the battles are extremely engaging, and the resolution is absolutely phenomenal. To make matters even better, the animation, one of the consistently strong points of the series, is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review372419">
        even more consistently high quality in this season with tons of absolutely beautiful cuts throughout the entire run.<br />
While the work does not recontextualize the shortcomings of the previous seasons into strengths, it does salvage everything it inherited in the best way possible.

    Following the panache of thrills and impassioned character-writing in AXZ, Symphogear XV had big shoes to fill. In my opinion, this season is a mixed bag. The beginning still carries in waves of residual oomph from the previous season, but the villains weren&#039;t as impactful and some of the plot fell in line with old narrative devices, that were implemented in past seasons. It didn&#039;t feel as fresh or inventive, but, it was an impressive feat, nonetheless!<br />
<br />
⚠️ This review will have spoilers ⚠️<br />
<br />
—Story/Characters<br />
<br />
This season starts out with a bang, when a beautifully animated concert-duet between Tsubasa and Maria goes awry! The crowd is mercilessly slaughtered

          <span style="display: none;" id="review366462">
        and Tsubasa is thrown into a bind, having an intense PTSD episode, remembering how her girlfriend, Kanade, had died in a similar fashion! It doesn&#039;t help that the malicious Millaarc has the ability to implant hypnotic suggestions into her victim&#039;s psyches! <br />
<br />
While AXZ mostly focused on the struggles of Chris, Maria, and Hibiki... XV focuses on Tsubasa and Miku, as the spirit of the deadly artifact, Shem-Ha, takes control of the vulnerable Miku, once again! The grand conclusion to the franchise, starts out really strong! There&#039;s a powerful, inciting event that throws Tsubasa, and her relationship with Maria, for a loop; everyone gets lustrous, new transformations; and the build-up for the bad guys, makes it seem like they&#039;re the most menacing foes that the girls have had to face... but the velocity of XV&#039;s grand finale loses momentum, during the latter half of the series.<br />
<br />
I would say, that the show starts losing speed after Tsubasa comes to terms with her family&#039;s brainwashing, and accepts her foster father, as her &quot;real&quot; Dad. Throughout the season, there are hints at Tsubasa&#039;s struggle with the echelon of power in her family unit. This season really expounds upon that and reveals that Tsubasa&#039;s struggle to find validation from her illiberal, Japanese traditionalist of a grandfather... stems from the fact that he&#039;s actually her biological father. It seems that to ensure that their bloodline would remain untainted, Genjūrō Kazanari slept with his son&#039;s wife, in order to conceive Tsubasa.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a nice moment, when Tsubasa&#039;s father protects her and she recognizes that it&#039;s okay to see someone, who is biologically her &quot;nephew,&quot; as her actual parent. It was a sweet moment, even though Tsubasa has struggles with the expectations placed upon her by her grandfather and the subsequent mind control that Millaarc inflicts on her. As for the development with Miku, she feels turmoil, from being the outsider of the group... but in the last few episodes, her and Hibiki are able to vocalize how much they mean to one another. <br />
<br />
In this season, the villains and the journey to save Miku were the weakest aspects, by far! The &quot;Custodians&quot; are like the automatons in GX, they are written to be threatening, but any deeper characterization of these antoagonizers is thrown overboard! Speaking of the automatons, the weakest bad guys from Season 3, Carol Malus Dienheim and the gang get brought back, and while the throwback moment is as nice as the shout-out scenes in Fate/stay night: Heaven&#039;t Feel... it doesn&#039;t really do anything to advance the plot. Everything we needed to know about these four, is already in the archives of GX! Their cameo doesn&#039;t really serve a sufficient purpose....<br />

Commentary: Haven&#039;t watched many of Mr. Ono&#039;s discography, but his choreography in the Symphogear series is awe-inspiring! After the first season, I was unsure of whether I could get attached to any of the characters, but the later seasons are a Herculean fusion of some of the coolest action scenes in &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; with sweet, saccharine shōjo-ai! I play the mobile game for &quot;Hypnosis Mic: Division Rap Battle,&quot; so now, I&#039;m super stoked to try out the anime adaptation! Brilliant director!<br />

Commentary: Ms. Yūki has become a strong amount of magnetism in the industry, even invoking a memorable presence in mobile games like Fate/Grand Order (&quot;Shuten-Dōji&quot;) and Azur Lane (&quot;Taiho&quot;)! I think that Ms. Yūki strong personality translates well in the case of Hibiki Tachibana, a cute girl that is strong-spirited and has a cosmic punch, that is practically unrivaled! Hibiki reminded me of my best girl in Girls und Panzer (&quot;Miho Nishizumi&quot;) and for the most part, tries to her best to keep the peace. Aoi Yūki did a wonderful job at making her cute, charming, relatable, and a fighter! Excellent seiyū!<br />

Commentary: Nana Mizuki is another very famous voice actress, having had lead roles in Mahō Shōjo Lyrical Nanoha (&quot;Fate Testarossa&quot;) and HeartCatch! PreCure (&quot;Tsubomi Hanasaki&quot;)! Ms. Mizuki conveys the anguished, yet distinguished nature of Tsubasa&#039;s character in a very charming and likable way! Over the span of the series, we deeply sympathize with her feelings of grief over her dead girlfriend, Kanade; as well as the struggle that she has, when pitted against the corrupt system that her wealthy family has implemented. Great character, great seiyū!<br />

Commentary: Although, she hasn&#039;t had as many roles as many of the other voice actresses on this list, Ms. Takagaki does a damned good job at making Chris immensely likable! I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever met one person who has remotely disliked her character! While being a hardcore tsundere, she&#039;s also very caring, kind, and empathetic; despite, her backstory and immense trauma during her stead as a villainess, in the first season! In my opinion, Chris is one of the best examples of a reformed adversary, and she kicks a lot of butt, too! Wonderful character and a phenomenal job overall, on the part of the seiyū and the writing team!<br />

Commentary: Despite everyone&#039;s dislike for Index&#039;s voice in &quot;Toaru Majutsu no Index,&quot; I am a fan of Ms. Iguchi&#039;s discography! Her role as Miku Kohinata is doting and maternal, and it reminded me of her roles as Tsukihi Araragi in the &quot;Monogatari&quot; series! She has a very charming, earthly aura when she plays certain characters — when they&#039;re not ecstatic, they&#039;re often very practical like Crusch Karsten from &quot;Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu&quot;! Magnificent job in making Miku stand out, even though she starts out as a side character! Superb seiyū!<br />

Commentary: Ms. Hikasa is very good at creating a duality of good and evil in Maria Cadenzavna Eve. In the past, I have described Yoko Hikasa as a type of sexy, temptress archetype! She has often voiced demons, very evil characters (Nashetania Loei Piena Augustra in &quot;Rokka no Yūsha&quot; and Nanako Saeki in &quot;Aku no Hana&quot; are a couple of examples), and even representations of Satan herself! Maria starts out very much an anti-hero, she has a Spawn cloak, and an undying loyalty for her controllers; but, despite this, deep down... Maria is very caring, and the protectiveness that she feels for Kirika and Shirabe, eventually extends to her other friends, as well! Even in later seasons, Ms. Hikasa is alarmingly good at conveying Maria&#039;s fight between her newfound morality and her brainwashed upbringing! Great character, wonderful seiyū!<br />

Commentary: Ai Kayano is known for having a sugary sweet voice and that translates well into Kirika&#039;s character. She&#039;s straight-forward and typically the most unassuming girl out of the group. She&#039;s simplistic and often even hard-headed, but she always means well, and she will risk her life for her partner, Shirabe! Ms. Kayano did an excellent job with this character, S-tier performance!<br />

Commentary: Ms. Nanjō has less speaking roles with the archetypically kūdere, Shirabe, but when she does has a time to shine—she&#039;s sweet, smart, and insightful! Very good casting choice, Toshino Nanjō needs more roles!<br />

Commentary: It&#039;s kind of surreal that Akane Tendō (&quot;Ranma ½&quot;) and Kikyō (&quot;InuYasha&quot;) have the same voice 🤔 With that aside, Ms. Hidaka is talented veteran in the industry. It&#039;s clear from how many lengthy shows she&#039;s been apart of, that she&#039;s no new-comer to voice acting! Her performance as the main villain, Shem-Ha Mephorash, the spirit that possessed Miku... gives off a strong spiritual vibe. While the writing in this season, may have not made her not the most grandiose ne&#039;er-do-well in Symphogear, especially when stacked against compared to some of her contemporaries... she is really able to invoke the ambience of a cosmic entity! Excellent voice actress!<br />

<br />
Commentary: I only know Ms. Terakawa as Kasumi Toyama (&quot;BanG Dream!&quot;), so I thought that her portrayal of  Millaarc Cranstoun was the strongest that I had ever seen from her! Kasumi is a genki, cloud-cuckoolander... and while I do enjoy that character, it was nice to see her spread her wings and try her hand at a malevolent villainess, instead! Wonderful work! The &quot;concert massacre&quot; send cold shivers down my spine!<br />

Commentary: Ms. Ichimiya is famous for being typecast as really attractive, bishōjo characters; and Vanessa was no exception to that rule. In fact, I thought she was the &quot;best girl&quot; character, out of the new trio. I couldn&#039;t bring myself to like Millaarc, after she brutally slaughtered all of those innocent people during Tsubasa and Maria&#039;s concert and Elsa was kind of plain, so, naturally Vanessa is the best option. She&#039;s beautiful, has a sultry voice and figure, and a teasing personality! What&#039;s not to love? Excellent seiyū!<br />
<br />
※Bonus: I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m the only one who conceptualized this idea but, to me, I thought that her android characteristics and costume were very similar to some of Shōtarō Ishinomori&#039;s (creator of &quot;Cyborg 009&quot;) female characters!<br />

Commentary: Ms. Ichinose hasn&#039;t been cast in terribly roles, but I have enjoyed the few I&#039;ve seen her in. Hers is not as distinctive as some of the other voices, but it&#039;s very cute. I would say that her best role, from what I&#039;ve seen, is Ichigo (&quot;Darling in the FranXX&quot;) because there was more depth and dimension to that character, compared to some of her other performances. Great job!<br />
<br />
Overall, Senki Zesshō Symphogear XV has a decent conclusion. The romantic moment with Hibiki and Miku holding hands under the Aurora Borealis, worked well as a touching epilogue to the franchise. The moments of introspection with Tsubasa and Miku is what made this season come together, so seeing Miku experience such a beautiful phenomenon with the person she cherishes the most, was a satisfying conclusion to her character arc. I rate Senki Zesshō Symphogear XV (Season Five) a 6/10, it&#039;s a series (among many others), that I plan to eventually purchase on Blu-ray!<br />

    I would like to say that Symphogear was a truly amazing anime that everyone can enjoy. Although a lot of people are thinking that this is a yuri series, is kinda debatable. But this show tells us about connection with other and trying to understand one other and that love has many forms and shaped. And not to mention with the ending we saw in episode 13, i can rest easy now that i know it&#039;s an neutral ending, where people can ship the girls with and whoever they want since that is kinda the draw back of Symphogear since like i said before: half

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318578">
        of the fan base believe that it&#039;s a yuri show. So please, if anyone want to watch the show without having in a argument or want to avoid people who force you to believe that it&#039;s a yuri show, please just enjoy the show without worry.

    No spoilers within.<br />
<br />
This show has high ratings because its rated by people who like the franchise as a whole and from a perspective of great bias.<br />
<br />
The characters don&#039;t really change or evolve over the course of the show. And when a character changes their mind leading to any change of mindset it happens without any real coercion or believably.<br />
<br />
The dialogue and interactions between characters is very childish and breaks immersion.<br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s the music. Its a music based show, except the music isn&#039;t good. Its very generic but doesn&#039;t even hold your attention. Its like opening music to a low budget anime, except it keeps occurring.<br />
<br />
TL;DR

          <span style="display: none;" id="review329799">
        there is no real character development, the story is boilerplate and predictable, the dialogue is weak and unbelievable. Its a music based show and the music is also bad.<br />
<br />
Give it a miss.

    Never thought I would made this far, but hear I am. It&#039;s been quite a journey from the horrible season 1 to this. The final season of Symphogear, and all I can say is...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I still don&#039;t know what the fuck is going on in this anime<br />
<br />
<br />
But is it a bad thing? not exactly. Did I enjoyed it? hell yeah i did. With all the crazy, over-the-top stuffs that&#039;s happened in this anime, I enjoy every one of it, even tho i barely understand what&#039;s going on (LMAO). It&#039;s my guilty pleasure. It&#039;s fun, it&#039;s sad, and it&#039;s FUCKING HYPE. You don&#039;t need to understand shit

          <span style="display: none;" id="review407653">
        if you have this type of hype the anime&#039;s got to offer. It&#039;s more bigger, more action packed and more insane than the previous season. Tachibana Hibiki grows from a Noise attack survivor to a symphogear-wielding, ass-kicking, god killing martial artist. Every episode delivers something insane and my jaw drops all the time. Also the transformation scenes, god that may be the most awesome transformation scene ever. I never got bored seeing it. The animation is top notch, the story is crazy, the characters are lovable and the villains are good. The songs are also great. I wouldn&#039;t really recommend this anime to everyone, but if you&#039;re willing to give it a chance, then go for it. It&#039;s been quite a journey, and I&#039;ll definitely gonna miss this anime. Thanks for reading.

    So, I watched Symphogear for the first time before this season was out, time passed, then I found out this came out, so I rewatched all of it before I picked this up.<br />
<br />
I wanted to say a lot of things about it because Hibiki is a character I adore, Chris is dear to me, and I overall enjoyed the show up to this point. But then this came out and, hm, how to put it.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m Jewish. I know not to expect too much about ethno-religion sensitivity when dealing with media from Japan but this was far and beyond what I&#039;m used to as someone who&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370049">
        consumed anime, manga and game content for over two decades now. Setting aside how even using some of the names they did is outright sacrilege, everything about it was offensive, from who the big bad was, through their motivations, to how they &#039;spread&#039; themselves, to the symbol they used when casting spells...<br />
I know a lot of people couldn&#039;t care less about this sort of thing, but after enjoying four seasons, this felt like stinging betrayal. Now, sure, I can&#039;t say whether or not they handled everything up to this point better, these are not my sensitivities so I can&#039;t comment about that. But this last season was nothing short of antisemitic. Judaism isn&#039;t a dead religion, it&#039;s not some ancient tradition and culture anime series can use however they want, least of all to vilify like this. <br />
<br />
Just really had to get that off my chest. A very bitter ending to a franchise I otherwise enjoyed, and I&#039;m grateful it looks like it&#039;s over

    This is an overall review for all its seasons<br />
<br />
One can rate a series in many different ways, we can discuss its story, its plot, structure and pacing, we can talk about its characters, the way they are realistic / believable, their development or the impact they have on the overall story. There are many, many aspects one can use to rate an anime, those were just some of the very few most discussed ones, but sometimes they can be enough to decide, whether the series is “good” or “bad”<br />
<br />
Sometimes it doesn’t matter whether the anime is bad or even horrible though. Sometimes we find something

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356648">
        we know is not “good”... and yet we can enjoy it way more than some of the objectively better series, despite all its flaws - we call them the “Guilty pleasure” and Symphogear now belongs to one of them for me<br />
<br />
Plots are very repetitive, simple and sometimes can get immature, there’s lots of classic anime tropes and stereotypes, and the characters are often not realistically believable  or one dimensional. And yet i still had an awesome experience like one of the few, all it took is a good concept and focus<br />
<br />
The said concept is very, very simple and yet very, very powerful one - It’s all about girls, singers, who gain their powers by singing. It sounds silly and it sure is, but watching a bunch of anime girls singing and fighting at the same time can get really awesome, especially when the lyrics change in most fights to fit the story and the character’s situation or mentality, which is something that had me sold quite quickly, because every episode is then quite a great audiovisual experience<br />
<br />
The whole series can be summarized with a single word - “Hype”. Hype is probably, together with the singing, its most important element throughout the whole 5 seasons, where both complement each other well, and the anime makes sure to prioritize the hype. Quick explanations, simple plots and characters, so that it can hold its fast pacing, power ups and transformation sequences, which are just awesome in the final season. The idea of a “Swan song”(=climax song) helped a lot as well, where they can get a really powerful boost, but for a deadly price. I still get goosebumps when I start hearing the first words, really great stuff.<br />
<br />
They can boast with their music overall though, as most of the openings and endings are bangers, thematic to the story and builds up the hype even more. Apart from music the whole series is really well animated too though, especially in the transformation sequences and battles, mainly in the climax ones, where together with the music it’s just bliss to watch<br />
<br />
Overall the series has many flaws, however in many ways it doesn’t take itself that seriously and delivers really well in what it tries to accomplish. It’s a really fun, action, pleasing, HYPE experience that is really hard to recommend, but it’s a great watch if you turn off your brain, especially the final season which was really lit.<br />
<br />
If anyone got interested, or wanted to try if he was interested, I can recommend trying the first 6 minutes of the 3rd season (Symphogear GX), where it’s a nice opening scene that shows they are not afraid start the season with a punch, as well as it shows some of its absurdity and it is relatively spoiler free, relatively.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading<br />

    The final season of Symphogear very much follows the formula presented in previous seasons; introduce new antagonists, fight for a bit, and then they eventually join up with the protagonists to defeat the larger overarching threat. There&#039;s noticeably less filler/SoL content, which helps smooth out some of the pacing issues I thought past seasons had. It&#039;s still a bit hard to follow, mostly because Symphogear has always been focused on its action rather than fleshing out its story. This wouldn&#039;t be a problem if the fighting was interesting, but we&#039;re still seeing the same 30 second long transformations, nonstop explosions, the same music for the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349269">
        most part, and the same special moves. It became stale, and when there isn&#039;t a strong story-line to fall back on it makes boring to watch at times.<br />
<br />
The characters are mostly same. Some familiar faces reappear (only to leave just as fast they came). Most of the character development is focused on the antagonists, who I only found mildly interesting. Tsubasa has a moment where her mental state flux, but it gets resolved in an episode or so.<br />
<br />
I did mention that the action became somewhat stale, but I still think its where most of my enjoyment came. The flashy moves and high tempo music were still enjoyable at times even its stuff we&#039;ve seen before.<br />
<br />
This season didn&#039;t change my overall view of the series, but I do think it got some things right. It&#039;s the most focused season, and I thought it closed off the series fairly well, but it still suffers from many of the issues I had with Symphogear up to this point.
