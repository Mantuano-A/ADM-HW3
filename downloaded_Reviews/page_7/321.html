    I&#039;m just gonna say it again, this is so underrated.<br />
<br />
Bungou Stray Dogs (3) builds on its solid foundation of characters, continue to weave its finest action and comedic blend for all viewers. Their fate continues to entangle and untwine, with third season zooming closer to them rather than their bombastic gifts, capturing the little moments that made up their characteristics.<br />
<br />
The charm and one of the specialties of Bones Studio is, the facial expression of the characters. It’s like watching children react to a movie with sad, delightful, shocking and horrifying scene. They are depicted accordingly to that situation, much like a child genuinely having the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311619">
        times on their lives in that moment. And these are infectious, especially Dazai who seems to be having the most fun expressing his immaturity that could tickle your bones. We could feel the chemistry they have while teasing each other and we’ll want to join in as well. Adding some spice on the witty dialogue, these comedic scenes could be pulled in to ease your nerves and show you the soft and gentle side of them. A relaxed atmosphere on heart-warming interaction.<br />
<br />
The suspenseful scenes, can grasp our breath and choke us to our limit. Rather than just focusing on building the ambience with its color palette and ticking the time limit, the menacing look from both the good and the bad sides increase it even further. With a single smirk and the sudden change of tone intensity of voice actors that seems to be unable to hold their rage or excitement, you’ll be brought right into the situation they are in. At that single moment when their pupils dilate, eyes widened and frozen expression of stunned surprise, the screen cuts to black and you know s*it is about to get real. These are the amazing power of a single look that could foreshadow the epic fight scenes and lit it up when it really does happen. This make us root for them, whether they are right or wrong, just because of how brilliance the set-up is.<br />
<br />
Third season cherished the return of the lethal frenemy Port Mafia, badass Armed Detective Agency and rising of The Guild, all while witnessing the rise of the strongest one-man mastermind they’ve ever encountered – Fyodor. <br />
<br />
Fyodor, is depicted to be a criminal mastermind, one which excel in mental attacks and a smart strategist that made his debut in Dead Apple. One that might even beat Ranpo. Ever since first season, ADA and Port Mafia have always held a fundamental rivalry towards each other despite them having worked together several times in overcoming crisis, such as the deal with The Guild. The prime example would be the formidable Agutakawa and sensitive Atsushi. But this season plays on closer to this blurry state they are in, risking to destroy the harmony built and erupting a fight between these two organizations that could split them apart eternally. In the face of imminent danger, they are to choose to either fight or fall together. And as they gets closer to the thin line that separates them, they will eventually learn the truth behind the bedrock of their organizations. <br />
<br />
Besides, Bungou Stray Dogs has its own way of storytelling. Its core of the twist resides in the way the groundworks of a situation is laid out, with each specification detailed on. It initially portrays a wreckage that seems to be impossible to be fixed, then it shows you how it can be fixed. However, this does not steal all the spotlight. The characters are the crucial element that enhance the story. Dazai, is the vital connection of them all, not only because he’s always managed to slip between two organizations but he because he is always 1000 steps ahead. He always seems to be hiding an agenda behind his little actions, as if trying to trick the world that he’s not Kira. And as such, he’s the most efficient character in drawing the best and the worst out of others.<br />
<br />
Main highlight of the premise has always been how much each character cares for other in their own way. Their diverse personalities enforced their unique way of interacting, not only amongst the Armed Detective Agency members and Port Mafia, but also between them. They have faith in their team member, and they back each other up in a way that none would get killed. Despite being enemy, their first option would always be exempted from killing each other, however, this doesn’t draw back the life-or-death vibe. Their relationship, is their strength that ties them up and their weakness that holds them down. It all comes to how they are portrayed to utilize that, and it’s worth every seconds to watch it unfolds. There are also more and more insights given on old characters, while adding some new characters, such as a specialist in IT. One of the insights being how Kyoka and Atsushi face their past with their parents, overcoming the inner demons that had been slowly haunting them and eating them away without them realizing it. It ends with a beautiful touch.<br />
<br />
The art, is by Bones too.<br />
<br />
The songs are quite wonderful, but it is the opening and ending scenes that are synchronized with them that brought the amazement and excitement level high up in sky. The ED is simply the best of all seasons, with the song &quot;Lily&quot; by Luck Life that is simply stunning as it brings back the shounen feelings from previous two season filled with regrets, pain and cheerful moments they’ve all been through. I could even say that it’s almost like a perfect recap but is still refreshing to watch how far they’ve gone from their initial start. One of the endings that I wouldn’t even skip for the sake of it. <br />
<br />
Overall, this season has been thrilling and emotional with its consistent quality in each episode. It strikes our heart when we least expected it, and continues to read us their supernatural tales with its dynamic visuals and vibrant characters. It gives closure to their past, as it opens up a new path to the future of unknown threats, heart-warming moments and everything in between. And with that, their adventure is ignited once again.<br />
<br />
Cheers, to the stray dogs!<br />

    Nowadays, it seems any anime announcement is possible. From My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU getting a third season to old classic remakes such as Dororo, almost any anime has a chance of getting a surprise announcement. Bungou Stray Dogs Season 3 announcement came to me as a big surprise as I thought the anime franchise would be done for sure after the movie. What the franchise brings together is a collective group of detectives with supernatural abilities. With the announcement of the third season, I was more than excited to once again jump back into the world of this literary extraordinaire. <br />
<br />
The first two seasons

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311616">
        captivated me with its ability to blend literature with a thrill of mystery and action. Having read the manga, it also seems the show itself has enough material to continue from where it picks off from the previous seasons. However, what did surprise me at first is the third season choosing to adapt a spinoff novel. Nonetheless, fans should be prepared as the first two episodes focuses on Osamu Dazai, the former executive of Port Mafia. We are also reintroduced to Chuuya Nakahara as the season decides to focus on their relationship. As Dazai’s former partner, we get an insight scoop of their characters that we didn’t get to see much of before. It can be a bit wonky at first but remains important. As partners, the two shares a charismatic chemistry between each other. Bungou Stray Dogs is well known for its character interactions and season 3 surely keeps its momentum. Don’t be alarmed if the first few episodes starts off differently. The pacing does soon jump back into the present story.<br />
<br />
Directed by Takuya Igarashi, he continues to pour his talent as season 3 focuses on the familiar version of storytelling tone. With the present timeline, we are also reintroduced to the Armed Detective Agency with core members such as Atsushi Nakajima, Doopo Kunikida, Kyouka Izumi, Kenji Miyazawa, Akiko Yosano, and among others. Port Mafia members such as Ryunosuke Akutagawa, Kouyou Ozaki, and Ichiyou Higuchi should be no strangers for returning fans. Even former Guild member Lucy remerges with a new role. Season 3 brings in these characters again as the storytelling unfolds while establishing renewed rivalries. Indeed, Port Mafia is still a prominent organization with their reputation and even their current membership roster. Ryuunosuke hasn’t lost his touch from the previous seasons as one of the most dangerous characters to step foot into their world. Soon after, both the Port Mafia and Armed Detective Agency is thrown into a feud again with much higher stakes on the line. With that, season 3 brings back the thrilling sensation I had anticipated for. Characters such as Kyouka has to once again face their past while showing how much they’ve changed. It’s these type of character evolution that Bungou Stray Dogs pulls off very well. <br />
<br />
Bungou Stray Dogs is a rare breed of modern anime that is inspired from literature writers and books. Characters are based off of famous literary figures from the real world. Assuming you’re a fan of The Great Gatsby, Moby Dick, or E.A. Poe’s series, some of the character names in the show may feel familiar. Port Mafia member Ryunosuke Akutagawa is based on the real life Japanese writer, often regarded as “Father of the Japanese short story”. From his personality and abilities, Ryunosuke is no doubt regarded as a morbid figure. His actions speaks louder than words with his commitments often brings trouble wherever he goes. The show retains its darker side of the underworld this season so do pay attention for small details going on behind the scenes. The Guild also makes a return despite not having their full roster anymore. Most prominently, we find out just how much Fitzgerald lost but after an event with Louisa May Alcott, he regains his will to reestablish the Guild. Nonetheless, don’t expect The Guild to truly be a powerhouse as they were from the past seasons. Season 3 establishes The Guild as an organization reborn rather than striving to become number one.<br />
<br />
Speaking of organizations, there’s also one known as The Rats in the House of the Dead. As I mentioned before, Bungou Stray Dogs is known for its deeper mysteries and this group is one of them. Not much is known about this group although it’s shown that their leader, Fyodor Dostoyevsky is a dangerous manipulator. He doesn’t fear death and is armed with an intelligent and cunning mind. With a God-like complex, he is one of the dark horse antagonists to keep an eye on this season. It&#039;s also one of the other key factors that makes Bungou Stray Dogs flow so well:  the ability to make meaningful antagonists. With its ever expanding cast and personalities. Bungou Stray Dogs continues to keep the series fresh.<br />
<br />
Once again produced by studio Bones, the show returns with its luster art style. The streets, cities, and architecture of season 3 remains adamant to bring a degree of realism. Character designs are unique for every character. More noticeably are their abilities as each is refined by their unique traits and style. The battle cinematics also remains fluid with carefully crafted body languages. And similar to the previous seasons, you can also expect a healthy dose of comedy. Character expressions adds on more effect to this with some of their exaggerated reactions. As for the main reasons people wants to see the third season, the humor, violence, mystery, and style all returns full fold. <br />
<br />
In this timeline, Bungou Stray Dogs once again proves itself to be able to carry the torch of the first two seasons. When the third season got announced, I also questioned if it can live up to its expectations. To be honest, I think the first season set the bar while the second season managed to expand its growing story and character roster. The third season further enhanced the franchise with its important background storytelling by adding in more intriguing characters while staying in touch with its themes. What an excellent comeback.

    SHORT SPOILER FREE REVIEW:<br />
<br />
Bungou Stray Dogs is simply... Bungou Stray Dogs.<br />
<br />
If you enjoyed the previous seasons of this anime, then you might as well also enjoy this third season, just dont get your hopes up and expect something extraordinary. In my case, I thought the previous seasons of Bungou Stray Dogs were just alright, but somewhere deep inside me I was just hoping for something &quot;more&quot; from this season and that left me a tad-bit dissapointed in the end. Dont get me wrong, this season isnt bad, but I also just dont understand the massive hype that revolves around it, as it just isnt anything

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311629">
        out of the ordinary.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, the story of this season was one of my least favorite from the three (which I find quite shocking as this one has the highest score on MAL). It is simply mediocre at most. I was honestly way more immersed in the previous 2 seasons and I also enjoyed them way more than this third one, though that may just be me and my shit-taste for quality anime.<br />
<br />
In the end, I&#039;m giving the 3rd season of Bungou Stray Dogs a solid 6/10. &lt;3

    You know for a series based entirely on books and famous bits of literature, there is surprisingly little coherence this time around.  A bit weird but not a deal breaker fortunately.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Much of Season 3&#039;s story can be summed up as: an extension of the story about the gifted in the city of Yokohama.  I say this not just to avoid any amount of spoilers for the season, but because the structure of the series is a lot less coherent and fluid as I initially expected the show to be.  In a way, Season 3 starts both after the fight on the Moby Dick against the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311651">
        Guild and...not.  The season this time around can be split into two distinct and clean chunks where the first half ties up character backstories and setup, and the second half focuses solely on the &#039;Cannibalism&#039; arc where we&#039;re introduced to yet another faction hellbent on breaking up the city&#039;s peace.<br />
<br />
Because of this, a lot of Season 3&#039;s beginning feels both disjointed and thrown together as backstories and separate points in time are put side by side in episode number.  As a result, the timeline of events feels disjointed and at times sloppily put together as the viewer is thrown around to watch not only different points in time, but different perspectives in order to build up the necessary setup for the &#039;Cannibalism&#039; arc.  Maybe a half episode for Atsushi, a gag half for a new character, three episodes for Chuuya, etc, etc.  Because of this, I feel like the series for once rushes itself to get these mini character arcs out there as soon as possible, failing to really polish up these stories since they fall between a range of half an episode to three episodes and achieve varying quality.<br />
<br />
This is also the area of the series that has the most comedy, as it serves more as down time and lets the more comedic portions of the show shine in the way I both wanted and expected them too.  I honestly wish they did more of these because it&#039;s the few points in the series where things aren&#039;t taken so seriously, and really help give an air of brevity.  Mostly because much of the first half has members of opposing factions dick around together instead of attempting to kill one another while causing massive amounts of property damage.  It&#039;s always a grand time seeing that.<br />
<br />
Thankfully the payoff for the series comes at a head during the reveal of the &#039;Cannibalism&#039; arc, which reveals a new faction known as the &#039;Rats in the House of the Dead&#039; (bit of a mouthful there), a mysterious faction that compared to the Guild...is not really one I&#039;m a fan of.  Much of this arc is centered around the actions of the faction more so than the faction&#039;s goal, as much of the intrigue comes from the conflict&#039;s problem and how both the members of the Armed Detective Agency and the Port Mafia attempt to resolve this concurrent problem that they both share.  It&#039;s what grabs the audience this time around, which is aided by more of Dazai&#039;s mysterious nature and a whole lot of lore regarding Yokohama and the history of much of its older cast.  While I don&#039;t really find the Rats all that interesting by comparison, they do help flesh out the &#039;main&#039; factions of the series, which I think is a better direction overall, though unfortunate for them.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
The writing for Stray Dogs&#039;s story really makes it difficult to assess characters by themselves aside from a faction by faction basis, which is usually why I abstain from commenting on individual characters for this series.  This issue is clear in regards to the Armed Detective Agency where really only a few of its members (mainly Atsushi and Kyouka) get any time dedicated to themselves.  Dazai of course still manages to wrench some time for himself due to his largely mysterious nature, but on the whole, Season 3 doesn&#039;t really focus on them, which is both a shame but not an unwelcome direction.<br />
<br />
I see this as more of a nonissue mostly because the Port Mafia gets largely similar treatment.  Individual arcs given to a small number of its key members in addition to participating in the &#039;Cannibalism&#039; Arc&#039;s main conflict is all we really see aside from maybe an extra episode or two in order to give perspective to the Rats.  Instead, the series puts more emphasis on the relationship these two groups have with each other instead of their identities as individual entities, which I think is a much more interesting direction to be taking because the dynamics and dichotomy I think is way more interesting than backstory because it builds on the here and now.  That being said, part of me still thinks the Port Mafia got the lion&#039;s share of the screentime this time around, which I actually think is an interesting direction despite the most cryptic member of the series currently belonging to the Armed Detective Agency.<br />
<br />
As for the Rats, personally I see them less of a faction and more of just &#039;the conflict&#039;.  Fyodor and his cryptic plan of what I assume is essentially just breaking and segmenting the strength and power of each of the two factions of Gifted is...not really clear.  The series definitely tries to be coy with his mysterious nature and constantly asks what his goal even is.  But because the series doesn&#039;t really give us any answers, I see the Rats as more of an intriguing conflict compared to the air power and overwhelming wealth of the Guild since the carefully laid out plans to thwart every loophole and idea the Armed Detective Agency and Port Mafia can come up with give this amazing sense of helplessness as we watch the factions dance in the palm of Fyodor&#039;s hand.<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough, the show even goes to the extent of giving a little afterstory to the Guild and its members, something that I actually didn&#039;t expect given how the Moby Dick got knocked out of the air last season.  They&#039;re mostly just little character moments rather than an entire character arc and a single episode, but definitely something I appreciate nonetheless.  Especially since I assume they&#039;ll come back some time later in the series full force without a brief ceasefire getting in the way.<br />
<br />
Aesthetics:<br />
<br />
Bones does not disappoint with Stray Dogs and I&#039;m bloody elated that this series gets the amount of love it does.  The art stays consistent with the sort of grim color palette where even the brightest of colors have a drab, muted look to them.  Not only that, but the bolded and thick outlines of the characters during things like comedy moments and a fluid style that switches from comedy to serious in a flash is something I can get behind.  Stylistically, I just love the art and I&#039;m just glad it&#039;s back.<br />
<br />
A few other things to note is the constant usage of the page graphic whenever one of the Gifted uses their powers (since everyone&#039;s based on a book and all) and just how nice it looks, something I don&#039;t think I ever took the time to really appreciate.  I do think however the art style can look a bit derpy at times.  There&#039;re a number of closeups that the series does to make the one character who takes up the frame look like they&#039;re facing two different directions instead of just looking horrified.  They do this semi-regularly, and I both find it weird and oddly hilarious despite the psychological element being poured into the specific moment.<br />
<br />
Not only that, but the series commonly cuts a few corners in the animation department, where background characters are given no movement whatsoever since the audience&#039;s focus is only supposed to be on the person in the center of the screen.  There&#039;re also missing faces on not just the background characters, but also on a number of distance with important members of the cast.  It&#039;s just kind of weird to me to see someone like Dazai or Atsushi just not have a face and they do this weirdly semi-regularly.<br />
<br />
For soundtrack, we&#039;re treated to &quot;Setsuna no Ai&quot; by GRANRODEO and &quot;Lily&quot; by Luck Life.  The OP in my opinion sounds scarily similar in style to how the OPs for previous seasons have sounded.  It sports this serious rock aesthetic that fits extremely well with the setting of a supernatural mob anime which is great and all, but not really something that I find amazingly memorable.  I still genuinely like the song, but for some reason I don&#039;t really find it all that memorable.<br />
<br />
The ED by comparison has this more energetic rock tone that&#039;s a lot mellower and calmer to its OP counterpart which I find to be a nice contrast.  Similarly, like its OP sister, I think the song is great on its own and definitely fits with the show, especially with how all of these factions function more like one big family instead of being just a massive crime organization that controls the city.  But really, I don&#039;t find it all that memorable and I really don&#039;t know why.  Just not something I would put on repeat.<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
I definitely think that Season 3 missed more than a couple story beats here.  Coming from how concise and focused Season 2 was in its buildup to the big showdown with the Guild, Season 3 by comparison feels looser and a lot less tight than its predecessors.<br />
<br />
The first half is really only held together by how innately interesting and interconnected a lot of its cast members are coupled with seeds of interest that&#039;re sown the moment the &#039;Cannibalism&#039; arc begins.  This really isn&#039;t much of a complaint than it is an observation, but its noticeable effect comes with how the series decided to put an end to some of the protagonists&#039; arcs, something that I think really could&#039;ve been handled better given how rushed and short they felt.  They are literally the main characters of the series!  Why is Atsushi given less than ten minutes to finish his deep seated issues in the orphanage?!<br />
<br />
Well, beyond minor complaints, I still found Season 3 to be a great experience all around.  Despite some pacing and structuring issues, it&#039;s still a solid show that doesn&#039;t stop grabbing my interest due to its interesting characters, constant action mixed with comedy, and conflicts striking the personal rather than something like &#039;the fate of the world&#039;.  A personal boon for me is just being able to see Koyo get way more screentime and development than she did in Season 2.  I love Ami Koshimizu, and just seeing her character get more time devoted to her is just great overall, especially since Koyo really needed the time after her introduction in regards to Kyouka.<br />
<br />
I highly recommend this show mostly on the grounds of just how solid it is all around.  I don&#039;t really have many complaints cause so much about Bungou Stray Dogs manages to impress despite me not completely showering them with praise.  Characters are interesting, plot is driven by personal conflict, art is consistent, soundtrack&#039;s kickass; there are hardly any aspects of this show that I can really say drag it down, and that to me is one of Bungou Stray Dogs&#039;s high points.  I still think previous seasons are a bit better, but that point is kinda moot when it&#039;s overall just really good.  My only real concern is when Season 4&#039;s happening, because this fucking train needs to keep going.

    I&#039;m assuming that if you are watching the 3rd season, then you are a fan of this anime series and you know what to expect. After the first third of the anime, I can conclude that Bungou Stray Dogs Season 3 has been a perfect representation of what a 3rd season should be and it has the potential to surpass the 2nd season&#039;s greatness!<br />
<br />
Just like the previous season, the anime starts off in the past and explores the relationships of characters years before the main time line which in turn builds up their personality and motives. I simply love when a show can take some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307710">
        time to simply explain and mould its characters into 4 dimensional beings. This time, we are going even further back to the meeting of Dazai and Chuuya and how they ended up with their love hate relationship while being partners.<br />
<br />
These flashbacks make every action in the present day mean even more and manages to provide clear but detailed explanations. However, this season manages to do so without making it an example of boring character progression due to great writing, excellent banter between the cast and bones producing some of the finest animation and action sequences as per usual. However, we can expect the character development arc of this season to be over and now we will progress into a gritty storyline which although hasn&#039;t been complex or mind blowing, has been very entertaining and well constructed. <br />
<br />
Compiling great development and characterisation with a well thought out plot that&#039;s executed well in terms of art and animation is something that we have come to expect from Bungou Stray Dogs and can continue to expect in its 3rd season! And although the soundtrack has slightly degraded, what we get is a great all round package produced by bones and one of the best anime of the current season!<br />

    The most Badass show to ever exist.<br />
I love Bungou Stray dogs, my icon says it all haha. <br />
Awesome production Awesome characters Awesome Soundtracks Awesome Action Scenes, Awesome Storyinle (Sometimes tbvh I’m question mark about what’s going on because I’m dumb but I love it anyways) basically BSD is a bunch of Awesomeness you can’t miss out on.<br />
<br />
(Mild Spoilers)<br />
Like season 2 it starts off with Dazai’s flashback about Arahabaki (Won’t give details) for the first 4 eps but this time with Chuuya, the best brotp ever. <br />
And then the current timeline centres around Fyodor who was introduced in Dead Apple movie.<br />
<br />
The openings and endings are amazing.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311681">
        I think this was my favourite opening, it just built the right amount of hype; and the quality just wow; and endings, well luck life’s songs just set in that ending mood!! From hype opening the transition to the emo ending mode is smoooooth~<br />
<br />
Kinda sad it ended so quickly. Wish I could see more of the detective agency all working together but I guess we can always go back to s1 for that. <br />
Overall definitely check it out. I don’t know why but Bungou is very close to my heart. Something about it hits close to home even though nothing about it is relatable per say lol.<br />
Hoping there will be a season 4 soon!!

    after watching the 4th ep of this season i decide to write my 1st review in MAL!!<br />
the ost as usual is great &amp; i love the oppening song &amp; the ending too, i&#039;m used to hear it every time but in this episode it was a masterpiece!! i couldn&#039;t get my eyes away<br />
the most thing i like about this anime is that the variety of characters, it brings joy somehow<br />
this is the 1st backstory that i&#039;m interested to xD, i think this season is more stunning and enjoyable then the 1st &amp; 2nd, i soppose they will say why dazai is obsessed with suicide or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307798">
        maybe they will leave that to an ova xD <br />
<br />
<br />
my 2nd review (ep7) :D : <br />
recently, i feel like &quot;an old dead inside&quot; person hhhh i mean i don&#039;t like most of new animes &amp; films... but in the 7th ep i felt my heart beat, i was so excited with the events even if dazai was not shown yet xD but the scene where konikida was with the littele girl was great and i love it even if his screm at the end wasn&#039;t that sad... &amp; that what i like about this anime it can be so sad but not too sad, and the scenes with tanizaki i love how they give every character a &quot;space&quot; on his own... maybe i will give this season 10 cz i&#039;m satisfied<br />
+ my reading of snk&#039;s manga from 1st season maybe was a mistake hhh i didn&#039;t enjoy it at all

    Mostly everyone hates back stories of characters when that given back stories do not add anything to the main story or characters or it do not gives depth to any characters involved, same is the case here. Last season also did this but second season added so much to current story and gave weight to ongoing narrative that everyone said that back story was better than main story.<br />
<br />
This time around its not even interesting and entertaining and its just boring and its wasting SAKUGA animation. I wanted to know why Dazai is hell-bent on killing himself but no we got see back story of side

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307713">
        characters. Why dazai is the way he is, its unknown but it would have been great to see why he is that way.<br />
<br />
Animation is great because its Bones and direction is okay I guess. I would say  it is by the books nothing new and creative as you would expect from a Bones. Story is overall also weak.<br />
<br />
I say watch it if you like fancy and mindless fights otherwise do not.

    Bungou Stray Dogs...all I can say is wow.<br />
<br />
I feel like this anime is a bit underrated, but man when I watched the first episode of the anime (not just season 3) I was hooked.  The characters are so well written and drawn, it&#039;s hard to pick a faviourite.<br />
<br />
Overall, the storyline for s3 was good but at times it did feel a bit rushed and I can understand why.  S3 only has 12 episodes so it is hard to animate every scene from the manga, but I felt like the moments that went slow in the manga went really really fast in the anime

    I watched the two first seasons, which followed each other rather closely, the film, an ova, I believe, and then finally this. Like season 2, the first half of the season is dedicated to a lengthy flashback that, in this case, explains the mysterious origins of a side character. One of the main side characters, if that makes a difference, but a side character. And I&#039;m still not sure why. It could have to do with the illusive Dazai, being perhaps a fan favourite, but what do I know? I don&#039;t even know if he is a fan favourite. The plots of Bungo Stray dogs

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363493">
        have not ever been very complicated, get the protagonist (season 1), fight the enemies (Season 2). Simple. Where the success of season 1 laid was in the multiple characters and the little side characters and their stories. Not many of those, mind, but it felt like there was a continuation of what happened before to what happened next. A rise and fall of incidents as it were. You could track the progression of the plot, the logic.<br />
Then comes along season 2, and you&#039;re thrown into a flashback leaving about half the run time for the actual plot. Fine, one of those characters shows up on the screen, so not a total waste of time right? Well... Only I don&#039;t see the connection between that past and the present, except to explain why Dazai switched sides, only I liked not knowing. It didn&#039;t, and doesn&#039;t, really matter. One of the good points of season 1 was the sense that relationships were well established before our protagonist walked in. It felt like a world where things had happened and while they were important at the time, didn&#039;t have relevance now. So why bother with it now? So they defeat the boss, who, shockingly, has motivations for doing what he does, hinting at a book. So what do you think happened? I wanted to know more about the book. They were willing to kidnap a human for I can&#039;t remember how much money but essentially a fortune, and destroy an entire city. Boom, gone. For one little book. A gimmick, of course, it could have been a magic wand for all it matters. But they set the stakes quite high for this tiny book, and we didn&#039;t even get to know what was in it, or where it was. So curious I was.<br />
Imagine how bored I was of flashback when yet another one presented itself for the 3rd season. By that point, my interest had been quelled by time, so I was so fed up with the extremely lengthy flashbacks that I just stopped watching it. Until this year, where I revisited season 1 and 2 for the nostalgia and the humour which I liked. Where I once more got curious about this blasted book. Of course, there were a few cool fight scenes here and there, thank you Bones, well done once more, which was worth watching it for. How OP isn&#039;t Dazai&#039;s former partner&#039;s ability? (That&#039;s how much I remember him, Gravity-ball guy)<br />
Anyway, I got through all that to maybe discover the antagonist was the villain of the flashback. I really couldn&#039;t care. He was frankly unimpressive, except for the first scene he was in. And so were the rest of the characters. Where did Dazai&#039;s intelligence wander off to during most of it? His cunning plans that I saw in season 1 and 2. The man who let himself be captured because he wanted to. The man who predicted his comrades&#039; abilities and desires so perfectly that no one important actually died? The Mafia&#039;s boss danger and cleverness? His charm and power? Where is the dangerous chief of detectives? And the very detective himself? I think they just removed him because of how big an inconvenience he would be. That is to say, the antagonist would have been taken down by him within the first episode (episode  5 or6, I think. Yeah) if he was a part of the ordeal. Half the show, ladies and gentlemen were spent on a flashback. A pointless flashback. 6 episodes to tell a story. Granted it wasn&#039;t a very good story. And again with the plot, it had nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with that book. There was no continuation of the last storyline, nothing. I was quite disappointed. And they didn&#039;t even get to fight the villain or see an epic showdown of wits.<br />
My point?<br />
Where did Bungo Stray dogs go off to in this season? Because I&#039;m pretty sure I didn&#039;t watch the same characters I did in season 1. And even season 2.<br />
My conclusion? If you want to watch it, go ahead. If you found season 1 enjoyable, season 2 less enjoyable, you certainly won&#039;t enjoy this lacklustre story. I wish I could say otherwise.<br />
Sorry that you had to go through my bad review on so many levels.

    Ah, shit here we go again, another season with the masivelly overrated show. This time it’s Bungou stray dogs. If you’re watching the third season of it, you probably know what’s this about, but if you don’t, then to summarize main characters are part of the Armed Detective Agency, the organization with detectives, who have magic abilieties also the main baddies are members of the Port Mafia.<br />
The story begins with a back story of a Chuuya Nakahara, and the fan favorite Dazai-san. It wasn’t espacially bad, but it was pointless, it basically added nothing. Chuuya beraly even reapeared later this season, not mentioning his previous

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311628">
        organization, which he apparently was a member of, wasn’t spoke of even once. Also I was very dissapointed with Ougai and the scene when he kills previous chief, it should’ve been a forshadowing to some events later, but nothing like that happened. This whole backstory was absolutely pointless, because if you introduce something in the beginning of the season it should’ve made significant role In the end, but it didn’t. I know that anime must do what manga does, but realy you should&#039;ve animate this backstory when it will be relevant to what’s happening In the story.<br />
<br />
Then the next episode introduced us to the main Villain of the season: Fyodor Dostoyevsky, who was held captive by the Port Mafia in hope to recruit him as a member, win with him a game of poker, where if Fyodor wins, he’ll be free, and if Mafia wins he’ll work for them. Fyodor wins by tricking the opponents, and walk’s out free. It was actually good the best episode of the season, but next 2 episodes are basically a filler, and the 7th episode was rushed. Also the main plot starts in the 8th episode! That’s still not as Bad as 2nd season of Kekkai Sensen, but still.<br />
The main plot revelves around the conflict between Detective Agancy, and Port Mafia, created by Fyodor, where each side must kill the boss of other to save their own. His goal is to eradicate every person with some kind of ability In the town, but he wasn’t able to do by himself, so why not make others do that. I guess it’s kinda clever, but it’s so much cliche!  But you know what’s even more cliche? *Inhales deeply* MAKE THOSE TWO CONFLICTED SIDES CREATE AN ALLIANCE, TO DEFEAT THE TRUE BAD GUY!!! Also I love the scene In 9th episode, where one of the characters jumps into explotion, being like 3 meters away, he doesn’t gets injured, but the whole ceilling does! OF COURSE, LOGIC! <br />
The conclusion was rushed, and instead of big battle with Fyodor, we&#039;ve got big battle with his assistant, who did nothing earlier, if he was even introduced! Also why would Fitzgerald help the Detective Agency catch Fyodor, they ware his enemys not so long ago, the whole 7th episode was to show how he was crushed after the defeat in the 2nd season, but now their friends like nothing happened. Of Course!<br />
So In summary the story is very incosistent, cliche, and with many plot holes. Main plot is starting to late and it’s below avarege.<br />
<br />
Everyone has their own tastes, so some people may like the cast here, or not. I actually dislike them, although Fyodor is kinda ok, also one of the good things in Bungou Stray Dogs, are character dysigns, and how stylish they are. But nobody can argue with me that there’s no character development along the main cast. The author attempts to develop Kunikida, but at the end of the day, he behaves, like nothing happend.<br />
<br />
The Visuals were actually the best part this season. Through the most part it was good, and I adore the graphics in the op and ed.<br />
<br />
The music was solid but nothing spectacular, it was better In 2nd season.<br />
<br />
Without unnecessary draging, I didn’t enjoy that. Too many plot holes and cliches, for me it’s hard to enjoy something like this * says giving 9 to Kekkai Sensen*. Generally I don’t like this show, most of the parts I just watch on higher speed becase I’m not able to enjoy them. Then somebody asks “so why are you even watching this?”, because moments like the backstory in 2nd  season, reminds me thet this still can be a very good show, but the writer is too lazy too write a good, and deeply written characters, which he showed he can do in the 2nd season. But I’m not judging anybady for liking this show, enjoy what you want. <br />

    A greatly underrated show. The season is a great continuation of the story that balances levity and poignant emotional beats. The backstory episodes deliver great insight into the characters you&#039;ve come to enjoy. It never fails to amaze me how this show can make you enjoy the characters so much and makes you want them to interact more and more. The relationships and characters themselves grow and develop so well. It makes you excited to find out what new author they&#039;ll introduce into the story and what ability they&#039;ll have. The art remains beautiful as always and the animation is fluid and spotless. The sound

    I personally loved this most recent installment in the BSD anime franchise.  Why?  Let&#039;s explore the reasons.  (FYI I&#039;ve only watched the anime, not read the manga/LN.)<br />
<br />
The story of Bungou Stray Dogs continues to deliver in this season.  From the long introductory side story about Dazai and Chuuya, to interludes about Francis, Fyodor, and about the parent&#039;s of Kyouka and Atsushi, to the main arc about the Rats in the House of the Dead, the story kept me consistently interested and eager for more.  I was particularly impressed by Fyodor&#039;s introduction and the reminiscence of Atsushi&#039;s childhood.  The former

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311731">
        clearly established Fyodor as one to be feared, while the latter managed to provide the exceedingly rare nuanced picture of abuse.  That certainly is a thorny road, but when you manage to tear up a little over Atsushi&#039;s reaction to the death of his abusive parent figure AND they both made the abuse understandable without it seeming justified, you know they nailed it.  That episode in particular pushed this anime to a full 10.  This season also made excellent use of the powers of the characters, expanding on them without stretching them beyond belief.<br />
<br />
The art retained its characteristic enjoyable nature, with some nice stylistic choices like Russian authors wearing coats and other characteristic clothing.  Fight scenes were probably the weakest point of this season, but that&#039;s pretty characteristic for BSD.  It&#039;s the head games that really matter, with the raw clashes of power coming across as underwhelming in contrast.<br />
<br />
Good OP and ED, nothing too memorable about the sound, but it also never felt out of place.<br />
<br />
Part of the genius of Bungou Stray Dogs lies in its ability to consistently add to its diverse cast of characters without adding trite characters nor overshadowing those characters already present.  Few anime have the diverse cast of BSD without resorting to tropes and caricatures.  I love an anime that is willing to forgo the cocaine pacing in order to participate in the alchemy of fleshed-out characters.<br />
<br />
I looked forward to BSD every week, and look forward to re-watching it the future.  What else can you say about how enjoyable an anime is?

    I think my opinion will be different than many of the others writing reviews on MAL for the third season of Bungou Stray Dogs.<br />
<br />
First of all, I thoroughly enjoyed seasons one and two of this show. I recommend them just as highly if not higher than season three. Season three has been a compilation of several characters&#039; back stories... and while some others have said that this does not contribute to the main story, or it is not entertaining to follow, (it doesn&#039;t make sense to me how you&#039;ve made it this far in the series if you feel that way) I completely disagree. I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309590">
        have liked learning the back stories of several of the key players in this series and I think this season is trying to give viewers a perspective from each of the gifted organizations that protect the city of Yokohama. There are different ways to go about it, but each faction is absolutely committed to protecting the city they call home. To me that&#039;s what this show is all about. And I think this season is setting up for a grand face-off between all the people/groups we&#039;ve been learning more about in season three.<br />
<br />
To whoever said the music from this season is weak: yeah nah. The way the sound is carefully weaved into the important moments of each episode puts a smile on my face and often gives me the chills. I think they&#039;ve nailed it with the sound this season as well as the two previous seasons. Bungou Stray Dogs has one of my favorite ending tracks. When the guitar comes in I know the end of the episode is nigh and a tear of sadness comes to my left eye and a tear of satisfaction comes to my right. I give the sound a 10. <br />
<br />
I would say that I&#039;m picky about anime art styles and this one suits my fancy. I like it a lot. I miss the little typewriter messages from the earlier seasons, but I give it a 10. <br />
<br />
I give character development a 10 because that&#039;s exactly what this season is setting up for. I don&#039;t find it too slow or too fast - one or two episodes of back story or side story, tie it in to the main plot, and do it again. I also miss some of the clever humor from the previous seasons that was mostly brought in by Dazai-san, and like most I wish they would focus more on him, but I&#039;m not bothered too much by that. For those wondering why he&#039;s dead set on killing himself: I think its just a personality thing to make his character more interesting. I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a specific story that will be told that explains the reason he is that way and I don&#039;t think there needs to be.<br />
<br />
Bungou Stray Dogs has quickly become one of my top ten favorite anime and it&#039;s pushing up to my top five. I think this show is quite underrated... it pains me to see shows like JoJo, Mob Psycho and others at the top of the charts when I think there&#039;s much more to be enjoyed in a show like Bungou Stray Dogs. I give my recommendation to all to watch it. <br />

    This season was disappointing to say the least. If you are a fan of anime only I would heavily recommend reading the manga. I usually despise manga purist but this season truly did a lukewarm job of adapting what was some of my favorite back story chapters.<br />
<br />
To start off they did a good job with the first couple of episodes dedicated to one of the popular side characters. I personally thought these episodes were good but needed to be omitted or put into an ova as the rest of the season is extremely rushed to make up for spending 3 episodes on a side character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309632">
        whose back story overall added nothing to the plot and in the end damaged the development of main characters and other side characters. <br />
<br />
Just to put it into perspective they spent 3 episodes on side character backstory that added nothing to plot. But decided that it would make sense to give the main characters backstory only half an episode.<br />
<br />
Everything else though is as amazing as the season before so-<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
<br />
Story: 6 to 7 at best<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
<br />
So overall: 7<br />
<br />
I&#039;m still going to give it a strong 7 because of the charm of all of the characters and how interesting the overall plot is. Just know that this season is the worst of them because Bones said &quot;forget all the other characters we need to give this popular money making side character more screen time&quot; because money I guess.

    I can easily say that this is my favorite season of the franchise so far. In these 6 episodes that are out so far every single one is filled with everything a good anime needs. We finally got some back story on Chuuya and Dazai and its just so good. I really loved the new character and his ability. I just can&#039;t wait for the next episode there are so many possible things that can happen that are crossing my mind, I just can&#039;t express it. The art is on point just like every other season. I really hope they keep the quality for the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309214">
        rest of the season, but I probably don&#039;t have to worry about that considering their work until now.

    It would seem like I hate this show but it&#039;s just disappointment. I&#039;m forever disappointed in how they wasted amazing potential, it being the incredibly well created characters (the more you know the real people the more you enjoy them) and the premise.<br />
<br />
POSITIVE:<br />
<br />
I enjoyed most of the first 3 episodes. I was actually surprised to find they treated Chuya as the independent, amazing character he is rather than a mere element to swirl around Dazai for the fangirls&#039; enjoyment (which, loving both characters, I find infuriating).<br />
BSD has REALLY good characters (I&#039;d go as far as saying this is the one good thing about the show).

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314835">
        The reason why I keep watching this is none but the characters. Thanks to this anime I discovered and fell in love with Japanese literature and its writers but the universe these great characters belong to makes them NO justice. No matter how many chances I give this show it&#039;s always utterly disappointing. <br />
<br />
NEGATIVE:<br />
<br />
After the first 3 eps it was simply... Bungou Stray Dogs. And Atsushi is just as ridiculous. Everything about him is just so repetitive. I got tired of his sh*t in S1 so imagine how I felt seeing he&#039;s still as irritating. I can&#039;t understand the mindset of someone who decided to make this guy the main character.<br />
As per usual, any great potential they ever had goes to waste with its nonsensical plot. That word can sum up the anime. Sloppy also. The reasoning behind anything and everything is either very poor or just terribly nonsensical. They always try to create something smart and complex, putting in the mix as many components as possible but it seems it&#039;s more than they know to handle. <br />

    IF, you&#039;ve been an old fan of bungou stray dogs then i&#039;m sure i don&#039;t need to explain about this much because y&#039;all are already watching or plan to watch it. <br />
<br />
but if you&#039;re someone new to this, please make sure to watch it in order first. <br />
<br />
That being said , i&#039;ll get down to the anticipating review you&#039;ve been waiting for. <br />
<br />
animation wise and overall everything is top notch and actually far better than the previous seasons. <br />
The songs are quite good.<br />
Now this season taps into the past here and there to highlight the backstory of the characters. But with the latest episode out,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308470">
        it managed to baffle me yet again as this season is not only about the individual character history but also how they are related to the present.I&#039;m expecting the plot to start rolling now and develop further from the next episode. <br />
Also you can expect new characters.<br />
<br />
Since it is ongoing and bungou stray dogs is full of surprises, i&#039;ll update my review later.

    This anime infuriates me. It could be so, so amazing if it would just pICK A THING AND STICK TO IT. Had this season been about what the last few episodes were about and ONLY what the last few episodes were about, this anime would an 11/10. But OH MY LORD, the inconsistencies are endless. <br />
<br />
Bungou Stray Dogs has an absolutely stellar cast of characters, all of them with interesting personalities and abilities. It has potential through the roof for storylines and backstories. It&#039;s written extremely well with a unique tone that you can&#039;t find anywhere else.<br />
<br />
So, with all these positives, why is it that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316542">
        this story can&#039;t seem to go an entire season without going off on multiple, episode long tangents? This anime has a real problem with giving the viewer new information at random times in a way that doesn&#039;t matter to the current story at all. I&#039;d understand if the backstories or whatever it is were integrated into the anime while relevant stuff was happening in the overarching plot, but that&#039;s not how it is. The beginning of this season specifically set up an antagonist and their plot, but then we didn&#039;t even get to learn about it until it was time for the ending battles because the time in between was just indiscriminately thrown around information.<br />
<br />
This season did better with it than others, but it&#039;s still really irksome. Honestly, I think this anime should really only focus on developing the antagonists for each season FULLY and then continuing the development for relationships like Atushi and Akutagawa&#039;s and backstories like Dazai&#039;s. Anything else just makes it way too muddied because it doesn&#039;t feel like it&#039;s being done effectively. <br />
<br />
Okay, my rant is done. This season did deliver 110% as far as battle scenes go. In fact, the Akutagawa and Atushi dynamic this season was almost entirely what saved my rating of this anime because it was written so well, including the battle scenes. The battles or the strategic moments we get from this season are all satisfying and, to be honest, epic to experience. The only thing I wish for on that front is for more of a detailed look at certain characters&#039; abilities being improved upon. I&#039;d like to see Atushi or Akutagawa or Kunikida or whoever train their abilities on-screen. That&#039;d add a lot to the anime, I think. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, had the story been fleshed out, it would&#039;ve been amazing this season. As it was, it got me really excited for what&#039;s next. I can&#039;t say it was presented well because it was all over the place, but again, this anime does have its writing going for it. <br />
<br />
Bungou Stray Dogs seems to always let me down early on in the season, but it always finishes strong. It almost makes it feel like the entire season was as good as the end was. Maybe that&#039;ll be the case somewhere down the line. This review probably didn&#039;t sell this season as well as it could&#039;ve, but I think the real testament to the addictive nature of this anime is the fact that I&#039;m still hooked. I&#039;m invested in the characters and what&#039;s next for them. So, I&#039;m gonna keep taking this story in as long as I can because I still believe something great will come out of it.

    I don&#039;t think Bungo Sray Dogs is like a really fantastic show, but it&#039;s fun to watch. <br />
<br />
BAD: <br />
a. The tonal consistency is really, really, really bad. You&#039;ll have a gun fight, and then there&#039;s a random comedic moment, and then back to gun fight, and then awkward emotional moment, and then ok back to guns. <br />
b. Plot is rushed towards the end of the season. In the last episode everything gets wrapped up nicely. There are also many plot holes. One moment a guy is stabbed through his throat and he&#039;s bleeding to death. But then because a friend of his with no healing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414742">
        ability shows up he is suddenly healed...? There&#039;s also 2 main plots in this season that aren&#039;t really related. The first one is about Dazai and Chuuya and then they are basically irrelevant for the 2nd half of the season. And the question is why have the first plot if the main characters involved soon become irrelevant?<br />
c. Abilities of authors start getting really contrived. In the other seasons they were vague, but reasonable and sometimes even clever. But here characters are introduced that have abilities that have little to no relation to their actual work, because plot points have to be hit. Goncharov wrote a work called &quot;Precipice&quot;  or &quot;Cliff&quot; centered in mundane life and therefore he can create golems...?  <br />
d. Speaking of Pushkin they really did him dirty. The founder of modern Russian literature, one of the greatest Russian poets of all time, a charismatic, attractive genius- he gets turned into an ugly fat weak foolish man, and his ability was not even something he wrote, just something he translated.<br />
<br />
THE GOOD: <br />
a. The characters are amazing(except for Pushkin) and the voice acting is phenomenal. I think in this show there is not a single poorly written character(except for Pushkin). Dazai&#039;s always very enjoyable to listen to, Miyano Mamoru is very very very talented.<br />
b. Music design is very good, I liked it a lot.
