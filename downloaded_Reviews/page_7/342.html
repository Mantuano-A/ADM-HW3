    This movie was amazing! I was a big fan of the series, so this movie was long anticipated. After six long months of waiting for the sub to be released (with the bluray/dvd release) it&#039;s finally out. <br />

First things first, the story. They did an excellent job tying the story back together. While there was some disappointment with the ending of the series, this movie brings it all home. I was surprised by how many small points in the show were actually significant events what would be referred to in the movie. The show was a bit of a wild ride, but I absolutely love

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200962">
        the story, theme , and setting. Everything about it is fantastic. However at points it can be hard to follow but it all ends up making sense.<br />
<br />
Next the art. They did an amazing job with the art style of this movie. It is not unlike the original series, with exception of amazing well animated fight scenes and a few amazing animations. I&#039;m picturing a certain scene, which you will know after watching the movie.<br />
<br />
The sound quality was also amazing. Usually, I could care less, as long as it doesn&#039;t sound like someone talking through a paper towel tube. But this movie had some amazing points in which I found my headphones rattling. It really blew me away. Some of the scenes sounds like a huge budget action movie. So more than I could ever ask for.<br />
<br />
The characters were as good as always with some amazing depth. They really touched on all the main characters well, and even some side characters. The story is very intricate and will not leave you hanging. I would love to go more into detail, but I&#039;d prefer not to spoil anything.<br />
<br />
Overall, it was an amazing movie, that inspired me to watch asap, and here I am writing my first review on MAL so that should say it all. Thanks for reading, and enjoy the movie!

    Mirai-hen is out now, and I watched it. The result? Well, it could&#039;ve been better.<br />
<br />
It is impossible to say anything about the story because the first thing you watch is a major plot twist about the end of the anime series, and everything goes around that twist. A minor hint, though: the movie is full of Akihito and Mirai tears. <br />
<br />
My problem with the anime series was its drama, and how it wanted to force you to feel sad or be sympathetic with its characters. That problem continues in this movie. As the movie takes itself seriously, the drama I really didn&#039;t like is everywhere.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200964">
        I didn&#039;t grow emotionally attached to these characters, so for me the drama presented here is just there and nothing else. And the worst part is that what made the anime so enjoyable for me, i.e. the slice-of-life, comedy moments between the characters, just got in the way of that drama, making them out of place and very uncomfortable (or in the words of Mirai, fuyukai desu).<br />
<br />
One of the reasons why the comedy didn&#039;t work was the background music. The OST was made to make you feel sad, and basically the same sad violin song is played all along the movie: during the emotional parts, during the lighhearted parts, during the battles, during everywhere! Seriously, it is impossible to laugh at how Mirai fails to hit a tennis ball if funeral music is being played in the background. The ED song was good though. Minori Chihara has an amazing and beautiful voice, and the song is really connected to the events of the movie.<br />
<br />
The characters also got some mild development. Even though the characterization is attached to the emotional parts of the movie, it at least answer (in a way) very good questions posed by the anime series: how Mirai got her ring, information about her mother, some mild explanation about Akihito&#039;s mother. Hiroomi continues being awesome and keeps a bit of his main character quirks. Unfortunately, Akihito and Mirai spent most of the movie crying and suffering, and we didn&#039;t get to see a lot of what made them really likeable in the series (although that is supposed to happen, given the main plot of the movie), and Mitsuki continues to be the useless, Senjougahara wannabe I&#039;ve got to know. <br />
<br />
There is little to say about the animation and art, only that it was, once again, absolutely gorgeous. Is Kyoto Animation, what can you expect?<br />
<br />
Although I didn&#039;t hate the movie, I didn&#039;t get to enjoy it that much. It suffers from lots of the flaws of the anime series, and neither the character development, nor the amazing animation, nor Hiroomi being the best character of the series could save the movie for me. <br />
<br />
HOWEVER, if you happen to be reeeeeeally attached to the characters, especially to Akihito and Mirai, and if you liked the drama of the anime series, then this movie would most likely be a 10/10 for you.

    In summary, I felt that the movie was good at least, if not great. There was many drama and cutting some loose ends from the anime. Now the reason why I said some was that there&#039;s still some other loose ends which are pretty essential, and this movie has covered some, but also created more.<br />
<br />
The story. It has many potential and they covered nearly all. Although there are some comedy, they stuck to the point, which didn&#039;t leave me hanging. They pretty much answered many questions. Personally, it was amazing, but the reason why I said &quot;nearly all&quot; was the fact that by the end,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200990">
        it was just it. I meant I asked many questions &quot;What happened to this?&quot; and &quot;What happened to that?&quot;, so on and so forth. I just begged more questions.<br />
<br />
The art. Long story short, outstanding. The animation, the visuals, everything, just great.<br />
<br />
The sound. They&#039;re great. Sounds effects, awesome. Music, beautiful. It could&#039;ve been flawless, had they timed it right on some parts.<br />
<br />
Characters. The movie covers mostly on the two main characters: Mirai and Akihito. I felt connected to them as they had to get through the suffering, especially from Akihito, as from the end of Kako-hen in the bonus scene (you better watch it first). The movie also told us the fate of the characters that went missing. However, the movie was so focused on these two that it left many other characters behind, including Mitsuki and Hiroomi. These two were pretty much left standing around, except for one scene where they find out who the masked person was, but even then, they weren&#039;t covered as much. Sakura and Ai-chan, yeah, they&#039;re just there.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment, it was good, but like I said before, it left me hanging around. It made me ask more questions both from the end of the anime and the end of the movie.<br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s a very good experience. Although it answered some questions, it does inherit some flaws from the series.<br />
<br />
Despite some flaws above, I personally recommend you watch the movie, if you watched the anime/Kako-hen of course. It&#039;s a great film.

    WARNING: The following review contains spoilers if you haven’t watched the prequel yet, read further at your own risk.<br />
<br />
Two words. Holy Cow.<br />
This movie was such an elevation from the series. It had the aspects of a near perfect “Missing Piece Movie”.<br />
<br />
- Story 8/10<br />
Honestly, this movie made me change my &#039;Kyoukai no Kanata&#039; score from 7 to 8. It makes perfect sense to do so as well. Originally, I thought that the Kyoukai no Kanata series had a happy ending, which was…. you know, too straightforward in my opinion. But as soon as the movie starts, you find out that SHE LOST HER MEMORIES!! This breaks

          <span style="display: none;" id="review207371">
        your heart a little and it’s what made me change my score of the prequel. Since it wasn&#039;t your average, ordinary, everyday happy-ending.<br />
<br />
- Art 9/10<br />
- Sound 9/10<br />
The animation went up, compared to the series, and the music composition was amazing as well. Brilliantly composed OSTs, just as in the prequel.<br />
<br />
- Character 8/10<br />
Okay so, in the prequel, I didn&#039;t get too much feels, since the character development wasn&#039;t the best there was to offer in a 12 episode series. But this movie had just enough character development from the past to make the viewers really feel what the character in the movie were feeling. I was thrilled and got the feels at the climax moments of the movie.<br />
<br />
- Enjoyment 9/10<br />
- Feels 9/10<br />
- Overall 9/10<br />
I absolutely loved this movie. What wasn&#039;t there to enjoy?<br />
Would rewatch it 100%, just like ‘The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya’<br />

    Surely one of the most anticipated anime movie this year for me, not to try get hyped but this movie is just awesome. I know the most people some kind don&#039;t really like about KyoAni anime production, who just give a great visual &amp; animation but always makes some moeshit anime without giving an outstanding story and attractive progression. My opinion, if you&#039;re one of that people try to watch this movie or Hibike Euphonium, i&#039;m sure after some reasons you&#039;re going to change your mind. Then, let&#039;s start the review:<br />
<br />
Keep your eyes for some  --SPOILERS--<br />
<br />
STORY (8):<br />
If you had watched the TV series before,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201077">
        so you probably don&#039;t feel strange about the story, if you hadn&#039;t, try to watch the TV series before you start to this movie. The story focused on Kuriyama Mirai, a high school student with the ability to manipulate blood and Kanbara Akihito who is half-human and half-youmu. The story continues from the TV series and taking place one year after last series. I think KyoAni finally shows us if a great quality should be mixed with awesome story. The story here really nice probably same or even better than the TV series, they gave enough propotion for fight scenes and also for some romance scene who particular are rarely be shown in last series. Something minus for me is just the quick tempo for character development which i consider it&#039;s ok because the time duration not too long. At least, the story is good after all.<br />
<br />
Sound (8):<br />
All soundtracks are nice and one of good point in this movie, i even tried to search all of the songs to i listen by my self. For voice acting, we really should give a thanks for all actors &amp; actress because of their great performances. The ending song also took my ear to listen it for 2 minutes ending, Minori Chihara&#039;s voice is just too sweet &amp; memorable, and i can&#039;t wait to download the full version.<br />
<br />
Art (10):<br />
This is what the biggest point of this show or even all KyoAni anime. KyoAni, once again provided a great visuals &amp; background for the animation, and they also proved if a great animation can make something different for all anime aspects. I am sure tought you&#039;re one of KyoAni haters, you just can&#039;t disagree about the stunning animation quality who they deserves.<br />
<br />
Character (8):<br />
Alright let&#039;s just make it clear, KyoAni as we know usually always deserves an easy enjoyable anime about daily life story with the most part of the characters are girls with one or two boys, or even no boys. But here, finally for first time since Inuyasha and Fullmetal Panic!, KyoAni broke their rule and start to make action anime again with interesting characters and background story. And for characters, they have their own characteristics here. A glasses but full care character like Kanbara Akihito, moe girl with attractive personality like Kuriyama Mirai,  sharp words but the most care character like Mitsuki, or even a pervert character but have cool image like Hiroomi. Everything was combined in one story, and since we know Akihito and Mirai have a romantic feelings, that will keep us to like them fully.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10):<br />
As i said in first time, i really anticipated this movie so long, so i have no reason to not enjoy it so much after all of that reasons, and i will  try to rewatch it sometimes....<br />
<br />
Overall (10):<br />
This is just my opinion, but i have no doubt to give it full 10 and i have no regret for that...<br />
if you like moe, so you will like this movie, if you like action with great animation, you must watch this movie, if you like romance, i suggest you this movie, if you don&#039;t like any parts of that, well...then you shouldn&#039;t open this page...<br />

    Just a disgruntled fan of the series:<br />
<br />
God this was a let down. I guess my enjoyment of the previous series over hyped this movie. I came here thinking this is going to be great and time is just going to fly by. NOPE. Waste of time. I&#039;m just disappointed now.<br />
<br />
STORY: 4<br />
<br />
Story was the most cheesiest thing ever. It is a romance drama with an action sub plot about an amnesiac girl and immortal boy. And then there&#039;s an uninteresting action sub plot. &#039;Cause the real plot here is the romance between Akihito and Kuriyama. The little small comedic moments was a hit and miss. Really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220500">
        this movie was unnecessary. A shit show. It was a dead bore to me and I&#039;m still be generous giving it a 4.<br />
<br />
ART: 8<br />
<br />
The art has not changed but that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s bad. I loved the detail they put in their animation. The hair. THE HAIR. It looked... so soft.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 9<br />
<br />
Loved the sound track. It was so fitting and smooth.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 5<br />
<br />
The characters were the same as ever, but there was nothing that would ever make me feel for them. Akihito never goes crazy at all. I was looking forward to that part of the anime as that is really what keeps the action going. It is the name of the anime. Do we see it? NOPE. We just have him regenerating and regenerating. Mirai was nice. There was nice development on her and saw a bit of her past. This made her interesting. Side characters don&#039;t matter.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 2<br />
<br />
Hahahahaha. Enjoyment? None. I&#039;d rather go to school than watch that again. I&#039;d rather sleep than watch that again. I don&#039;t think I&#039;d ever enjoy a single AMV of theirs ever again. An unnecessary end. To an already brilliant anime.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 6.33

    It&#039;s been a long time since the last anime I seen makes me pounding (and it&#039;s been a long time too since the last review I wrote). This movie almost makes me give a perfect score for it.<br />

Story: How they correlate with the previous movie are really exceptional, the story develop with a proper pace from begining to the end, with a suprising story line. And what more important, the ending was perferct (at least that what I thought).<br />
<br />
Art: They&#039;ve done a fabulous job as expected as the previous series, background art lookin so smooth yet the battle effect so fascinate.<br />
<br />
Sound: The insert song sound

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246868">
        very good and match with the flow, and  I really love to hear more and more this movie OST.<br />
<br />
Character: All chara from the previous series, there&#039;s no new chara introduced, yet they all still appealing, and their seiyuu could&#039;nt done better anymore, it&#039;s already more than enough.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I got very curious of the story, like I said before, it&#039;s makes me pounding so I never get bored while watch this. Me and my brother, both gave an applause at the end. So yes, I really enjoy this movie so much, if you not watch this yet, then you better do it now.<br />
<br />
Overall: NOTHING TO WRITE ANYMORE, JUST GO SEE WITH YOUR OWN EYES.<br />

    WARNING: This review contains explicit language.<br />
💯 SPOILER FREE<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, okay. No wonder I still felt empty after watching the series. I thought something was missing but there&#039;s actually a sequel! Nice. Maybe I&#039;m gonna find my closure after watching this.&quot; — Or so I thought. <br />
<br />
The 12-episode series was a supposed to be a beautiful, heartwarming, tearjerker story— if there weren&#039;t huge-ass question marks all over it. So after finding out about the sequel I thought it was a dramatic touch, the answer to all the questions left by the series. It wasn&#039;t.<br />
Instead of giving me answers, what it gave me was even bigger questions. And

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264158">
        what was once complicated is now even more complicated.<br />
I&#039;ve realized that watching KNK is like having sex, your partner is so close to hitting the right spot, it builds up and builds up but then you notice that it going nowhere so instead of having a good time, you just end up frustrated and thinking you never want to do this ever again. Did I and my review make sense? No? Well so did KYOUKAI NO KANATA!<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe the story concluded this way because they intended to have another sequel?&quot; — As of now, I couldn&#039;t care less. I feel trolled, honestly. <br />
<br />
Overall: 3<br />
Watch it or not, nobody really cares. Its your time that you&#039;re about to waste. At least you&#039;ve been warned.

    I have watched the entire episode of the anime itself the summary movie. The concept of the story itself is actually good though maybe some people won&#039;t like the humor element that has been added in all the seriousness. Or maybe the character itself was never really intended to be serious. <br />
<br />
In this movie however, less humorous action can be found. It even goes to the point where it is nerve wracking. The concept however, lacks details. Many questions are left with things I do not understand such as, <br />
&quot;how mirai can go back to life?&quot; <br />
&quot;why she suddenly lost her memory?&quot; and <br />
&quot;how can

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205694">
        the youmu not affect others when it should have infected them the moment you meet them??<br />
Well suppose it does affect them by showing how weak they have become. Still, they are supposed to be overcome by darkness and suppose they are stronger than darkness and are able to suppress it , it does not show in the movie how. Moreoever, does pulling the affected person from darkness kills the youmu inside the person? If it does not then the possibility of them going dark or mad again would be big no?<br />
<br />
Still, despite the lack of details, I love how the movie ended.

    Story (9/10 - Good Job, But Missing A Few Things)<br />
-If the originial series, and first movie, were about Kanbara Akihito&#039;s acceptance of himself and the destiny that his life follows, this second movie is about Kuriyama Mirai&#039;s past and the true nature of the Cursed Blood. As a second movie, it has done great. The story itself felt like it could have progressed naturally following the first season, and was more about fighting one&#039;s inner demons rather than the real demons (or lack thereof) that are external to the Spirit Warriors.<br />
-The plot itself is a common theme in anime, if only just to get more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review208178">
        money from a sequel. It&#039;s a common trope tht&#039;s a bit overused, and you can&#039;t really expect anything else from Kyoto Animation. Kyoukai no Kanata received above-average sales and KyoAni milked it for all its worth. On one hand, the first series left behind a somewhat open ending giving a chance for this movie to come into fruition, which is something that KyoAni always leaves as a just-in-case move. <br />
-On the other hand, the dialogue is beautifully crafted. It perfectly trumps the flawed circular thinking that was Kanbara Akihitsu&#039;s reason for doing what he did in this movie. It sums up the relationship between the three Nase siblings and just why Izumi seemed so distant and the two younger siblings seem to watch her in awe. I applaud the great story, the great dialogue, the great relationship between the characters and their development in the months we were unable to see with them being off-screen.<br />
-We still don&#039;t have answers to most of the questions the series left us, about the Nase Elder, the Society, Inami Sakura, the sister-complex, but we did get a somewhat satisfactory answer to the characterization of Nase Mitsuki (which I will go into detail in the latter part of this review).<br />
<br />
Art (10/10 - Perfectly KyoAni AF)<br />
-I can&#039;t ever give KyoAni anything lower than 10, especially after that game-changing art introduced by K-On!. Kyoukai no Kanata is an epileptic light show which it prides itself in that fact, and I can never get enough of it. The animation continues to be fluid, the lighting is always setting the mood, and the emotion shown in just their eyes is tearjerking - meaning KyoAni continues to have a perfect score from me.<br />
-The heavy action scenes in the later half of the movie were spectacularly made and had no inconsistencies at all. Every detail was thought thoroughly, every movement and scratch on the characters&#039; faces were detailed with the precision that KyoAni is famous for. Great art.<br />
<br />
Sound (9/10 - Good Job, Only Tiny Things Left)<br />
-The real soundtrack only came in during the middle part of the movie, where we get a confrontation between Mirai and Akihitsu in the park with the cherry blossom trees. At least, that&#039;s when I actually noticed it.<br />
-The music used was appropriate for the scenes and struck me emotionally enough that I&#039;m quite satisfied with what this movie is leaving behind for us watchers. The atmosphere was greatly enhanced by the choice of sound effects and I legitimately almost cried because of the emotion the music put into certain sequences. Good job.<br />
<br />
Characters (9/10 - Good Job, But More of Mirai&#039;s Past Wouldn&#039;t Hurt)<br />
-As I did with my Kyoukai no Kanata review, I&#039;ll list down the noteworthy characters.<br />
Kuriyama Mirai<br />
-This movie was almost entirely about the conflict that was within Mirai as a child of the Cursed Blood. It certainly tried to show us the reasoning behind the moniker behind the clan, and also certainly tried to wrap it up within 1 1/2 hours, but it left me somewhat &quot;Huh?&quot; due to the lack of information and the casual mentions of forever. All in all, not a bad characterization, but somewhat too ambitious of a plot to try and resolve in a movie. <br />
Kanbara Akihitsu<br />
-Jeez, and to think that in the series I was actually convinced that Akihitsu was capable of dying. In this movie we again see a lot of stabbing, grazing, and slicing of this guy and he just won&#039;t stay down.<br />
-The movie did a great job of pointing out just how dumb Kanbara Akihitsu&#039;s logic is when it comes to Mirai&#039;s happiness, and it&#039;s a good thing because I&#039;m quite tired of guys trying to be martyrs and playing hero when the heroine can decide for herself, thank you very much. It wasn&#039;t focused too much on Akihitsu&#039;s past, although we got short snippets of it. His mom&#039;s identity was finally cheekily added, which answered one question while leaving the rest to ponder on.<br />
Nase Hiroomi<br />
-Hiroomi continues to be my favorite character (okay, it&#039;s a tie between him and Mitsuki, whatever) and his development in this movie is realistic and perfect. With Izumi out of the picture, just how will Hiroomi take the mantle? He&#039;s only recently graduated high school, and he&#039;s left with an entire town to protect with his carefree, eccentric, sister-complex disposition and various amounts of adults doubting his capabilities. He can certainly be responsible, strong, and mysterious, but always seems to be upped by Izumi. Poor guy has got the neesan-complex, imouto-complex, as well as a middle-child syndrome. Gotta love it.<br />
Nase Mitsuki<br />
-Mitsuki was cast aside as the most cliche tsundere imouto in the series, and it disappointed me because I was in love with her character design. However, in the movie, we at least see why she acts the way she does and is treated the way she is by other characters. <br />
-Technically speaking, she is in no way as proficient as Hiroomi is when it comes to caging. Her powers are very rarely seen, and somewhat inconsistent in strength throughout the series. In the movie, we see Mitsuki actually put up a fight with the Cursed Blood. It was satisfying, sure, but it really shouldn&#039;t have been THAT satisfying when Mitsuki should have been above-average in the first place due to her Nase blood.<br />
-First we have the fact that she is the youngest sibling, with vastly more powerful older siblings to look up to. She understands (or demeans herself enough) that she will never reach the heights her older siblings can attain. Izumi, the cold, calculating neesama who ruthlessly protects the town she holds dear for the sake of the family. Hiroomi, her eccentricly comedic older brother who kicks ass when he gets serious. And then Mitsuki, the baby, who&#039;s never really told what&#039;s going on and when she is, she&#039;s not allowed to speak it with anyone else. Second, she follows Hiroomi. In Asian culture, the boy is the true heir. It doesn&#039;t matter if he was the fourteenth child. As long as he&#039;s the first son, everything goes to him. So Mitsuki grows up with the knowledge that she will never actually have responsibilities in the Nase household.<br />
-In the movie, Hiroomi shows her just how valuable she actually is. Mitsuki comes to terms with the fact that she has to be strong, for her friends, family, and herself. I like that the Nase household policy is to do everything you can to get strong enough to protect everyone you hold dear. Mitsuki finally realizes that in this movie.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10/10 - Are You Kidding Me? Perfect!)<br />
-Come on, I love every character. Of course I would enjoy this. KyoAni has me wrapped around their capitalist finger. Their spectacular design enraptures me and leaves me sobbing for being worthy enough to witness such amazing art and heartfelt love for their characters. Not disappointed in the least.

    In full honesty, you didn&#039;t need to be a major fan of the original series to be able to like such a movie. The story was a step up from the original series and had a well developed basis in regards to how it portrayed each individual motive.<br />
The art is by Kyoto Animations, enough said. Kyoto usually sticks to slice of life anime, but the amount of funding and quality they put into their works really shows in this work because they are on par with the best at action scenes like ufotable.<br />
The music is on point as always, Minori Chihara delivers in her works.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review202932">
        The use of orchestra is masterfully weaved into the background to allow the background to deliver.<br />
Some characters like the antagonists do not seem to be developed enough to fulfill their motivations, but the story does well to portray how the main characters pave their paths to happiness. <br />
Enjoyment-I can die happy

    First of all: The KnK TV series is my all time favorite anime. I waited long months for the movie to come out on the internet. I had really, really high expactations. But were they fullfilled? Read more to find out. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story 10/10<br />
The story starts right after the ending of the anime (or rather, the extended ending of the kako-hen movie), so one year after the plot of the TV series. Hiroomi graduated from high school and took his sister&#039;s place as the head of the Nase house. Mitsuki and Akihito are in their final year. Everything else remained the same. <br />
Except for one thing.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review209971">
         Mirai has lost all of her memory for unknown reasons. Not wanting to drag her back into the world of Spirit World Warriors and Youmu, Akihito decided to distance himself from her in order to let her live a normal life. Mirai, however, feels strangely attached to her Senpai and seeks his company. At the same time, strange black puppets who don&#039;t seem to be Youmu appear out of nowhere and start attacking people.<br />
The plot was heartbreaking, really. I felt like shedding tears every time Akihito started to cry because of Mirai. And that was a lot. Of course, you can&#039;t put a full new original story into a 1 1/2 hour movie. I knew right from the beginning that this wouldn&#039;t become a second season. So, did KyoAni make the best out of it? <br />
What you should know first is that the movie (just as the ending of the anime) are KyoAni original works and the events don&#039;t happen in the Light Novel. <br />
The movie did feel a bit rushed, yes. But that, too, was to be expected. And putting that aside, oh my god, it was absolutely amazing. The beginning scene got me hooked up already (although they were only talking and in Japanese at that, since I watched the movie first before the subs came out. My Japanese isn&#039;t the best. And I still felt like crying.) It is just beautiful to watch and did everything right as far as a movie can. Every minute was used wisely, not a single second wasted. <br />
And the ending. Oh, the ending. Be prepared. <br />
&quot;Did KyoAni do a good job with the plot?&quot; - The answer is yes. They did a superb job. <br />
<br />
Art 10/10 <br />
KyotoAnimation is known for their incredibly beautiful art. The TV series was really, really nice to look at, you say?<br />
The movie&#039;s art work and animation is even better. Maybe one of their best works. Be it the movement of the characters, the fighting scenes, the cherry blossoms (THE CHERRY BLOSSOMS. IT&#039;S ART, MY FRIENDS.) or the tears. It looked so. god. damn. good. <br />
<br />
Sound 10/10<br />
The ending song &quot;Aitakatta Sora&quot; by Minori Chihara (Mitsuki&#039;s VA and the singer of the TV series OP) was, of course, perfect. But the background music during the movie was the same. Always fitting. Nothing to say about that.<br />
The voice actors did a great job as always. I especially adore the voices of Akihito and Mirai. The feelz were real. <br />
<br />
Character 9/10<br />
This is where I am a bit uncertain. <br />
Let me say one thing first. I love the characters theirselves. Akihito and Mirai are my all-time favorite anime characters, and I freakin&#039; adore the Nase siblings, Sakura, Ai and everyone else. <br />
But. <br />
I feel like KyoAni did a few things wrong here. I can&#039;t really explain it, and it&#039;s probably because the movie had to be kinda rushed, but some things just didn&#039;t feel the same as in the anime... kinda out of character. But still; it is nothing major. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
Can&#039;t you feel the joy? <br />
<br />
Overall 10/10<br />
The best anime movie I ever watched, and a good ending to the anime series. The only thing I&#039;m still missing is the Light Novel. (and maybe a second season when it&#039;s finished. I don&#039;t care how. Just do it.)<br />
I can only recommened this movie - and of course the TV series - to everyone. Please do watch it. It needs more love. <br />
<br />

    For them to wrap up the anime with this movie was just pure brilliant. Lovely movie!! It is recommended that you finish the anime first before you start this movie because it is about the events after the last scene of the anime. <br />
<br />
Story: 9/10 <br />
The story was quite enthralling throughout the whole movie. The plot twist that started right from the start of the movie was quite unexpected. I almost got out of my seat ( not literal LOL). The buildup to climax was also done nicely, the movie tied up the loose ends and delivers the romance which I shipped for so long!!

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201057">
        AM BIASED TOWARDS THIS ANIME.<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10 <br />
Nothing much to say except...ITS KYO ANI! What makes them so famous is that shiny, moe and rigid and detailed animation. It just makes the whole movie so much more attractive and addicting to see. Many of the scenes in the movie brought out a lot of emotion just from the animation itself so its just that good. GOOB JOB KYO ANI<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
The OST for the movie was good but nothing really spectacular. Probably the only downside for the movie. <br />
<br />
Character: 8/10 <br />
Another great aspect for this movie is the characters. More specifically is the main two protagonists, Mirai Kuriyama and Kanbara Akihito. It was just lovely to see how their relationship would progress especially with the whole plot twist in the movie and baam,.. Magic happens. Their interactions were quite well done, overall they managed to convey and bring out the best of the storyline of the movie. But of course, the secondary characters also helped them to deepen their relationship but in a more indirect kind of way. The characters arent that cliche imo so yeah...well done! (Am biased towards moe characters. GUILTY AS CHARGED)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment; 9/10<br />
All in all, I enjoyed the movie very much because it did what the anime could not which was to deliver the romance onto thE big screen for our two main protagonist and also to clear up some loose ends from the anime which were pretty significant. <br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
A well done movie but not exactly masterpiece but I can honestly say that Mirai Hen movie does the anime justice. Any fan of the anime can agree with me. SO go watch the anime and then this movie now! You will definitely love it!. <br />

    &quot;Is that really something you can decide for her?&quot;<br />
<br />
What is happiness?<br />
For something that isn&#039;t tangible, happiness is something that is hard to describe. We can&#039;t touch, buy, or see happiness, so how do you know if what you have is genuine? How do you know if you&#039;re truly and wholeheartedly happy? <br />
<br />
Beyond the Boundary - I&#039;ll be here touches deeply with this theme of happiness and how it affects its characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
KyoAni is a studio that has gained a fairly large reputation over the years and has graced us with many notable series that are considered the cream of the crop in terms of art and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201099">
        storytelling. This is why I was a bit disappointed when I watched the original Kyoukai no Kanata series. The art and animation was amazing as always, but the plot ended up building plotholes which made it hard to fully understand and piece everything together. <br />
<br />
This movie was planned to be the sequel of the series, and aimed towards answering all of those questions that were raised when watching the original series. Was it successful in answering the questions that I had while watching the original series?<br />
<br />
Yes and no... but it was beautiful to watch. KyoAni has always been known for their great art style and animation, and it really showed in this movie. Its animation high points simply take your breath away. Its fighting animation was incredibly smooth and clear, which made the fight scenes beautiful to watch in terms of art quality. <br />
<br />
The plot of this story on the other hand, had large expectations to match, since we were left with quite a few plotholes that were never answered in the original story. They also introduced this new theme of happiness, and how characters in this story try to perceive whether or not this happiness that they desire is genuine for themselves and for those around them. This theme was nicely explained and resolved. It made the plot seem a bit more relatable for us as the audience even if the story revolves around youmu&#039;s and spirits. There was something for us to relate to which made the dramatic scenes impactful.<br />
<br />
BUT.. I believe for this movie to be a success it had to answer the plotholes that were created previously and thoroughly explain everything so that we as the audience aren&#039;t left with huge unanswered questions about the plot and what&#039;s happening. <br />
<br />
When I say yes and no, I believe they were successful in answering the questions that arose when watching the original series, but I felt the movie also created alot more questions as well. It felt as if they did not heavily dive that deep into the plot of the story, as most of the explanations only appear in the last half hour of the film. Now, the questions I had in the original series was answered, but now there are many scenes in the movie that are left unexplained and in the end, it felt really unlikely to leave the movie without being somewhat confused about what exactly happened to some characters and why it did.<br />
<br />
The sound was an aspect that I didn&#039;t really notice about the movie, which is kind of a shame since in the original series, I fell in love with the beautiful ending song. It did seem like they used to person who sang the opening of the original series for the end song in the movie. It was nice to listen to but in my opinion nothing too special, but that&#039;s just my personal taste. The OST&#039;s on the other hand really complimented the scenes for which they were used in. They weren&#039;t something that I&#039;d particularly find online just to listen to it, but nonetheless, it was a great accompaniment.<br />
<br />
So did this movie meet every single one of my expectations? No.. but it was one hell of a fun ride filled with such beautiful animation and art that in itself would satisfy many individuals. What it lacks in terms of plot, it almost makes up for with its stunning animation and art. It&#039;s an interesting movie that i&#039;d recommend for people to give a try if they liked the original series.

    Story: Mirai-hen picks up from the ending of Kako-hen. A new supernatural force arises and threatens to break the tenuous relationship between Kanbara Akihito and an amnesic Kuriyama Mirai. It&#039;s a good story, but like the series of the anime there were a few questions that went unanswered. <br />
<br />
Art: Amazing as always, from the bright and colorful backdrops to the details of the character&#039;s eyes.<br />
<br />
Sound: I noticed that the artist for the ending song was also used for the opening song of the original Kyoukai no Kanata. In this perspective, the show has come full circle !<br />
<br />
Character: Overall, the characters haven&#039;t changed much. The circumstances

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201024">
        in the story have made them more dramatic and solemn, but Kuriyama Mirai is still a bit of a klutz, Kanbara Akihito is still a glasses fanatic, Hiromi is still spoiling his little sister, and Mitsuki is still tired of her brother&#039;s sister complex (for the most part). <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Due to Mirai-hen being a movie, and therefore not having as long a duration as a 12-episode season, the brilliant comedic relief from before is replaced with a lot of drama and tears, but that&#039;s to be expected of the story. The lack of humor is made of for in resolved issues, fortified feelings/affections, and returned camaraderie.

    So who was pissed off with the Kyoukai no Kanata anime series ending?<br />
<br />
Ok before LA gets into the meat of this movie, LA might as well say what LA thought about Kyoukai no Kanata anime series, it was a decent effort from Kyoto Animation, but having the anime want to be a shounen anime, but became a more generic moe-moe romance anime, the characters were quirky, typical of Kyoto Animation and another thing typical was the brilliantly beautiful animation done by them, but the biggest letdown was it&#039;s ending as LA stated above and just how open-ended they left it.<br />
<br />
Kyoukai no Kanata Movie: I&#039;ll Be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review234455">
        Here - Mirai-hen however amends this.<br />
<br />
Kyoukai no Kanata Movie: I&#039;ll Be Here - Mirai-hen left off one year after the anime series did and there are two huge plotlines for this movie, Plot A being Mirai Kuriyama voiced by Risa Taneda and Akihito Kanbara voiced by KENN mainly concerning Mirai&#039;s memories and Akihito&#039;s dilemma of Mirai&#039;s memories and how it can make Mirai &quot;happy&quot;, and Plot B is that a new form of monsters that are attacking Hiroomi Nase voiced by Tatsuhisa Suzuki, area since Izumi voiced by Ayako Kawasumi (his older sister) has gone missing and a mysterious cloaked being controlling those shadow monsters, quite easily Plot A &amp; B will merge together and it&#039;s when Plot A &amp; B merged together is when the movie REALLY starts moving things. Plot A by all means felt lot a like the typical episode from the anime series, what with the callbacks to the anime series, the character&#039;s running gags along with the slice of life school life and the comedy in general coming into Plot A, LA does understand why Plot A is like this, a sorta refresher even after watching the anime series and to concentrate on Akihito&#039;s dilemma for Mirai and bring it into more detail for the climax later on. LA can excuse Plot A for this. Plot B doesn&#039;t have much screentime for the first quarter of the movie mainly because of Plot A, but still Plot B does peep in once or twice to bring up this plot point, once Plot B comes along, well bring in the shounen supernatural aspects that Kyoukai no Kanata lacked in both the anime series and the movie itself. Really LA&#039;s favourite part of the movie comes in once Plot A &amp; B merges together into one huge goal in which Plot A &amp; B will BOTH get resolved into one big &quot;problem&quot; that affects the major players of the movie, from Mirai, Akihito, Hiroomi and Izumi. The merged plot definitely helped with tying loose ends from the anime series in nearly all aspects from the great battles, dense character development and progression emotionally and even if the near the conclusion, it gets lotus-eater machine mindfucked but still, even the conclusion ended on a satisfying note.<br />
<br />
The character development for this movie really starts to actually look into our major players of Kyoukai no Kanata and that is one of this movie strengths, not only &quot;plot-wise&quot;, but emotionally we see each of the character&#039;s development even further detailed from the anime series, again from Mirai&#039;s memories and Akihito dilemma about Mirai&#039;s memories, to Hiroomi trying to protect everyone but at the same time want to reconcile with Izumi, sure the minor characters like Mitsuki Nase, Ayaka Shindou, Sakura Inami and Shizuku Ninomiya get their screentime be it for fight scenes or exposition or character emotion wringing out moments, but they are nothing but supporting characters who gets slight developments as for concerning the more main characters. The one little problem LA found was the &quot;big bad&quot; of this movie who hardly gets a &quot;big battle&quot; and the Big Bad essentially tells his plans and then just.........fucks off. Wait WHAT???. LA KNOWS but still the big climax to the movie was still good even without this big bad and LA didn&#039;t even realize who the big bad was until his flashback for him in the anime series arrived and really LA didn&#039;t mind as the big bad had such a short screentime LA forgot even in the anime series.<br />
<br />
The animation, well once again done by Kyoto Animation, is just beautiful and gorgeous for the most part and default thing to talk about, but even the battle scenes have some dynamically fluid moments and just sakuga battle scenes, there isn&#039;t much LA can say about the animation cept typically beautiful and sakuga KyoAni.<br />
<br />
The voice acting, well this is kinda where LA needs to say that although broad and excellent vocal talent we have, the movie has alot of &quot;angst&quot; for the majority of the movie and this goes into most of the seiyuu&#039;s and yes, they go into angst alot of the time, if not that then they go into the typical character archetype we saw in the anime series and if not that, then they go full out &quot;shouting at top of your lungs&quot; courtesy of Risa Taneda and Ayako Kawasumi who trumps this and is where LA will easily isolate Risa Taneda as LA&#039;s favourite voice actor in this movie and she goes through ALL of the things (angst, typical archetype and SHOUTING CRAZY)...just damn Risa, that was good.<br />
<br />
LA found Kyoukai no Kanata anime series as indifferent, it was &quot;fine&quot;, it had it&#039;s faults and it&#039;s strengths but what made the anime series &quot;indifferent&quot; was that aggravating ending, again LA will state at the start of this review, Kyoukai no Kanata Movie: I&#039;ll Be Here - Mirai-hen amended this all the way, sure even this movie had it&#039;s problems with it&#039;s constant angst, minor characters who become nothing but that, a big bad who is nothing but a catalyst to kickstart the climax but do nothing other than that and that mindfuckery near the conclusion, but still the movie by all means redeemed the &quot;sins of father&quot; and what Kyoukai no Kanata anime series was missing and the movie balanced out doing &quot;shounen supernatural&quot; and &quot;KyoAni slice of life moe&quot; and best of all.......CONCLUDED THE STORY from the anime series!...yes can LA talk about this, most anime movies just brings in a &quot;movie-only character&quot; and brought them in only for them to be dumped and forgotten, Ao no Exorcist Movie, Bleach&#039;s first movie, and even though it was good movies Bodacious Space Pirates: Abyss of Hyperspace and Psycho Pass Movie did it too. Kyoukai no Kanata Movie: I&#039;ll Be Here - Mirai-hen is one of few rare movies that CONCLUDES the story of an anime series. What can LA say but if your a Kyoukai no Kanata fan, it&#039;s a no brainer that you should watch this movie ASAP especially if you wanted to see Kyoukai no Kanata&#039;s story resolved and finished. LA SHOULD have watched Kyoukai no Kanata Movie: I&#039;ll Be Here - Mirai-hen MUCH SOONER...

    The graphics and sound etc etc was great. I guess this movie was both satisfactory and un-satisfactory in that there were things I wanted and things that I didn&#039;t want. And the movie gave me a jumble of these. <br />
<br />
They completely turned the original anime&#039;s story on its head with the beginning of Mirai-hen. Yay, but also Nuuuuuu. Both Mirai and Aki suffer so much in this and the feels .... were intense, but they did not cause me to cry. Which suggests to me that the character development and explanation were not significant enough, not deep enough to cause me to fully hurt for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205290">
        them and for that hurt to physically manifest. (note: I cry easily).<br />
<br />
I wanted more fluff at the end when this whole thing resolved, but I should have seen that not coming. There is a bit, but perhaps not enough. We see little of the slice-of-life genre that we grew to love in the anime and I think that&#039;s a shame. I wish it weren&#039;t so. <br />
<br />
But, I do love the characters, and I am grateful that some more background knowledge was revealed to us. Things about Mirai&#039;s past and Akihito&#039;s Mum (although again, wish they told us more about that). <br />
<br />
I love these characters and they hold a special place in my heart, but I wish this was done in such a way that I would have felt complete. <br />
<br />
Perhaps the mystery of it all is supposed to be its charisma, but I&#039;m a person that likes complete closure - and well.. that&#039;s not what I get. <br />

    Light years better than the anime. I mean its not even a competition. Everything I wanted from the anime was fulfilled here. Man the animation and the emotion in this movie are fantastic. The storyline is still as confusing as ever but in full honesty I would of rather have just watched this and not the anime at all. Some really great moments and the ending is far superior to the anime. Only reason the rating isn&#039;t higher is because they&#039;re are some parts that are just straight boring or I just didn&#039;t really care about because I didn&#039;t really care for the character in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review389188">
        the first place. But, I will say that is not the movie&#039;s fault but actually the shows fault. I really love this anime studio specifically for there artwork and man they did not disappoint. The silent voice movie was perfect in my eyes so it was definitely pretty hard to go against that. Anyway, I really enjoyed this anime movie and I fully recommend.

    -This review contains some spoilers.<br />
Before I start my review, I have to apologize for my bad English. <br />
<br />
The movie comes to finish the story, and to answer many questions of the first season, all on the movie is good, animation, sound, story, and the characters development. <br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
This is (in my opinion) the busiest anime in Kyoto Animation, but there were no inconsistencies, in the fight scenes the animation was impressive and left nothing to be desired. I also wanted to highlight the expressions that the characters emitted, everything was so detailed and incredible, that I could not fail to mention.<br />
<br />
Characters: 9/10<br />
The characters have a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345731">
        lot of development in this film, highlighting Mirai&#039;s past, and also focuses on developing the relationship between her and Akihito.<br />
<br />
Story: 7.5 / 10<br />
The story really is incredible and closes many points left in the first film, but it didn&#039;t completely close the history of the anime, there were things to be explained and the way everything was explained seemed a little busy for me.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
The film is really very impressive and can hold you all the time, the non-forced drama can work well and is very well spent, I really found it very fun to watch.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
The soundtrack remains impeccable, in moments of struggle and drama it proves to be very exciting and exciting, it really gives an emotional appeal to the outstanding scenes.<br />
<br />
We can understand perfectly what the protagonist is going through, and why he cannot tell Mirai what happened in the past between them. The drama goes very well in this film, you are taken by surprise of the many things that happen, it is not that kind of predictable anime, this film was incredible in many ways, and I believe that it was only possible thanks to KyoAni. <br />
<br />
This is mine first review, I just said what I thought of the movie.<br />
Overall: 10/10

    to;dr warning!<br />
<br />
So recently i talked about the respective 12 episode series this movie proceeds from and how it could have been better, and how it had qualities i didn&#039;t like about it. I also commented at the end of the review that the movie could redeem these qualities but would have to be in credibly good to do so. <br />
<br />
Dayum cuz. They pulled out the budget on this. The thing i doted about on the series is how nice the animation looked but they turn it up to 11 in this movie. They explain a lot of what you want to know at the end

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262128">
        of the show thankfully. For that i am grateful because i don&#039;t enjoy thick ass plot holes in my show. That inst to say they&#039;re might not be a small plot hole or two. Mostly just an unexplained reason for someone having a certain power or something like that, but if you use your ability to disconsolate with critical bullshit thinking then it inst even close to a problem.<br />
<br />
The romance was very touching, and in my opinion, beautifully crafted. I don&#039;t want to ruin anything by explain to much, but i didn&#039;t find it to be too melodramatic in the sense that they have felt alone and betrayed all their lives. So it makes perfect sense that the two interests feel like they are always going to fall apart. Even the relationships between characters i didn&#039;t expect to advance did as well. Sibling bonds and underlying reasons for certain choices were established through and through and it felt genuine and nice.<br />
<br />
Personally just watch the first movie that summarized the first season so you can skip the uncalled for crap that drags the show down and makes the characters feel like abashed romcom dregs. <br />
<br />
The only way someone will not really care for this show is if the art isn&#039;t for them because it is a bit cutesy, or if you just don&#039;t care for a show that has drama or romance in it. to everyone else have a nice time my bois. Makes you feel inside and it&#039;s nice to feel sometimes. A 10 might be high but i feel like a 9 is to low. Being a nice guy i&#039;m just gonna round up on this one<br />
<br />
Final thoughts: I talked mad shit on the heroines catch phrase, but the way it was incorporated in this movie was very touching and redeemed it&#039;s annoying quality to actually be moving by the end.<br />
<br />
