    Strolling through a grey and barren wasteland, two girls are on a journey. Rations are their only food, each other&#039;s company their only comfort and a Kettenkrad motorbike and a protect rifle their only partners. This is a story about a post-apocalyptic future, cultures lost in war and appreciating the little things in life.<br />
<br />
Few future settings display the thoughtfulness present in Girl’s Last Tour: war has, multiple times, left its mark on Earth and humanity. The numerous layers of the forsaken and metallic city tell tales of many civilizations long gone; their technology gradually grows more sophisticated and the cityscape more complex by the layer.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265973">
        Their different religious beliefs, or lack thereof, as well as their different perceptions of beauty are ingrained in them: some show idealistic symmetry spread evenly throughout, others are dominated by religious symbols resembling a progressed Christianity. However, their god seems more like an alien creature possibly playing a central role in mankind’s long history of war…<br />
<br />
The themes and background of the show allow for contemplation and its war-ridden lands give ground for cynical criticism of war, but Girl’s Last Tour is not at all about nihilism, the cruelty of war or the dangers of technological advancement. With overpowering optimism and gratitude for life, it avoids dwelling on many of its philosophically potent and open-ended questions through the sheer simplicity of its appreciation for the here and now; there is solace in solitude and beauty in company.<br />
<br />
It’s hard not to get swept up in the show’s pensive mood, but it is near impossible not to fall in love with the protagonists&#039; fun antics: Yuuri and Chito have amazing chemistry and partaking in their intimacy is a truly soothing experience. The two share a heartwarming bond of love and trust and remind one of simpler days; to take the role of an onlooker is to embrace a heartwarming nostalgia.<br />
<br />
Chito is the duo’s brain: she is literate and reliable. Over the years, she has learned to work around Yuuri’s shortcomings and deal with her eccentricities. At times, her diplomatic mindset clashes with Yuuri’s air-headedness. However, she has no issue striking back should it get overbearing, for she knows it’s the only way to get through to her dense companion.<br />
<br />
In comparison, Yuuri might at first seem like an unpleasant person. She is a glutton, unreliable and at parts overbearingly annoying - but actually a very caring individual. She keeps looking out for Chito and ensures her safety, she is sorry when Chito is hurt and does her best to express her guilt. It is not only her shortcomings that need to be worked around: her partner has serious fear and submits to panic at the blink of an eye. Fortunately, Yuuri always stays supportive of her.<br />
<br />
Rusty pipe systems, snow-clad plains filled with weapons of war and desolate temples - the show’s landscape is empty and its designs range from simple to highly complex. The dark, barely saturized, grey color palette only changes during dreams and revelations. Unlike one might initially assume, the empty and wistful world radiates a romantic feeling. While it may be devoid of nature and has no ecosystem to speak of, the countless tales told by the cityscape itself more than make up for it. The bubbly moe character designs help alleviate the central juxtaposition of the cold world and the comforting company of the two protagonists (and whomever they might meet along the way).<br />
<br />
Such sparse environment rarely allows for much movement to take place, but through dosated usage of CG the show enables engaging camerawork and alleviates the overall experience. The CG itself does unfortunately not hold up to the gorgeous and detailed look of the hand-drawn backgrounds but it in turn allows the explosive scenes to benefit from the momentum achievable through animation - and they look great!<br />
<br />
The show’s solid visuals are accompanied by both upbeat and melancholic music. In insert songs, the vocalist creates a great feeling of departure encompassing an euphoric mood and a grieving goodbye. On the other hand, the Opening and Ending songs excel through their sheer musical simplicity. They embrace modern electronic music and pop culture (the moonwalk and even dabbing), depicting and enhancing the fun shenanigans of the two girls and their endless journey.<br />
<br />
Due to its metallic landscape, the soundscape of the show mostly consists of industrial sounds: petrol engines, gunfire and cold, metallic echoes dominate, and their prevalence is only trumped by the two girls’ dialogue.<br />
<br />
Girls’ Last Tour is lighthearted and emotionally poignant; it excels through simplicity and thoughtfulness, but never dwells on the latter. The juxtaposition of its thematically dense but desolate cityscape and the intimacy of the main duo create a melancholically wholesome experience and make it one of the best shows of the year.<br />
<br />
Score: 85<br />

    Ok, so it seems like i am the only guy in this entire site that didn&#039;t like this show (at least in the review section), so i fell the need to write why this show is so terrible.<br />
<br />
Also, this is my first review in the site and i&#039;m not a native english speaker, so sorry if the structure of this review seems garbage to you.<br />
<br />
Firstly, i want to say that i was very excited to see this show when it came in the seasonal chart, i didn&#039;t know how it whould be, but even if it was just a generic slice of life show, it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266142">
        would be interesting just by the premise, bonus it was made by White Fox, that is one of my favorite studios.<br />
<br />
What i got was really dissapointing: a show about literelly nothing, most of the show is just these two girls walking and visiting some unisteressing place, and that is it, i wouldn&#039;t have a problem with that if the show had something interssing that could haddle it to be entertaining, but... what this show have of entertaining?<br />
<br />
Story? None of it, most of the show is episodic and there is barely any worldbuilding. Good comedy? Nah, there is barely any comedy at all and the few jokes are just Chito punching Yuu. Cute girls suffering shit? Meh, the girls act like the fact that they are the last two humans in the entire earth are just normal business. Some philosophic and 2deep4u shit? Nope, none of the stories have any meaning at all.<br />
<br />
Not saying that a anime MUST do some of these things to be good, these are just some ideas of things that Shuumatsu could do to be at least enterteining, but shuumatsu does none of it and does nothing that i didn&#039;t say too, it&#039;s just two girls living, nothing is fun, must of the stories barelly have a conflict, nothing has any purpose at all, everything is just a great piece of nothing.<br />
<br />
And bonus, this show is slow as hell, it drags a in a lot of things just to fill that 23 minutes mark, like bake a loaf for entire 2 minutes or take 3 minutes with a montage that is pure filler, and all those facts combined result in to the most boring show in this entire year, i think i could not watch it all if i didn&#039;t watch it weekly, cause must of the time i was just waiting for the episode end so i could do something better.<br />
<br />
Another thing that could have saved this show would have good characters to handle the boredom, but that brings in another problem that is the characters are more bland then a piece of paper, they&#039;re uncharismatic, boring and do not stand out, and this wouldn&#039;t be a problem in a normal show, but this are the ONLY 2 characters in the entire show, you can&#039;t just be this lazy and expect the viewer to give a shit about then in this way.<br />
<br />
I could also talk why this ending is forced and totally garbage, but spoilers are agains&#039;t the Review Guidelines, so if you want to know, ask in my comments.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, this show is just a waste of premise and it&#039;s a shame that such talented people did work in this, i hope WF give us a better work next time.

    Imagine you’re trekking into a dense forest with your friends. The sun is going down and it’s getting late. Then, you hear strange unknown noises coming from all directions around you. You check your phone and it has no signal. You can’t find the compass in your pocket and there’s no food left. Now, you and your friends just realized…you’re lost. You’re in trouble.<br />
<br />
I don’t know how many of you have been in this type of situation before but watching Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou brings a similar feeling. The idea of being lost in an unknown place evokes a sort of uneasiness. The constant fear of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265960">
        danger, feeling restless, and hoping to survive is what really attracted me to this show. To me, Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou (Girls’ Last Tour) is much more than just a world-end journey. It’s a show that combines slice of life with post-apocalyptic themes for the sake of survival. Do they need a reason beyond that? Not really. Yet, it doesn’t really need more to sell its masterful storytelling.<br />
<br />
To be clear, this anime takes place in the aftermath of a vague apocalyptic event. What do I mean by vague? It basically means that the anime doesn’t fully explain the details of what happened in the past. It only leaves behind details with places, objects, and symbols that characters will discover. In the meantime, this anime does a solid job at world building. Essentially, their world is dead. It’s devoid of almost all life. What’s interesting to note is that the structures, gadgets, and weapons looks realistic enough to relate to our world. These range from food factories, libraries, tall towers, and among others. Even some of the weapons that appears in the show looks realistic such as the guns and iconic tank that the two characters operate. Throughout this anime, we can only interpret the various mysteries of their world. To be honest, that’s what makes it intriguing. The anime doesn’t give true answers and leaves the viewers to theorize with their own imaginations. “What happened to this world?” is a big question mark I’m sure most viewers will formulate throughout the show.<br />
<br />
If you’re invested into a linear storytelling of complexity, turn back now. This show isn’t to please a certain demographic but instead relies on its creativity to do the storytelling. Every episode is an adventure of its own as Chito and Yuuri makes new discoveries during their journey. At times, it almost feels like playing an open world game like Assassin’s Creed Origins or Fallout. The vast open world of unknown leaves behind so much to explore and honestly, it’s what bought the most interest for me. From cultural symbols to mysterious ruins, it’s a show that carries itself without a plot doing the talking. Our two heroines, Chito and Yuuri walk the earth without an end goal and it’s dazzling at how much interest they bring in.<br />
<br />
Of course, Chito and Yuuri are the main characters that ultimately connects the show together. Without these two, there wouldn’t be a journey. Watching Chito and Yuuri together really shows that the two has a unique relationship. Chito’s calm composure balances out Yuuri’s easygoing personality and two makes a dynamic approach to their survival. For instance, Chito has the skill to drive Kettenkrad (their spider-like tank). She’s the one usually making decisions thanks to her literate skills. On the other hand, Yuuri has the knowledge to operate firearms, a skill essentially for their survival. The two make an interesting team in that although they don’t always agree, they’re able to collaborate to survive. However, a big part that attracted me about the duo is their character chemistry. There really isn’t many characters in this show so watching these two connect really brings the best out of each other. There are episodes that show their imaginative creativity and make the most of their situation. Despite their current condition, Chito and Yuuri enjoys each other’s company and even has fun when the opportunities present itself. Their small talk is also meaningful that even includes some philosophical dialogues from time to time. Still, this show does introduce a few characters although they only make sparse appearances. Kanazawa and Ishii are human beings that our main duo will encounter. Their encounter with them brings an interesting side and provokes a question such as “are there others like them out there?” Their role in the show is also interesting to note as they help each other to survive while accomplishing their own goals. Later on in the show, there’s also another character introduced although it swings into the otherworldly category. <br />
<br />
You would think a show like this is about despair and sadness. No. If you take notice, you can easily discover that Chito and Yuuri lives their daily lives happily. Their journey takes them to ruined cities as they scavenge for supplies. They even hope to make memories from this journey with the help of a camera. Additionally, there are episodes that puts these two into ludicrous positions such as being drunk. I can also honestly confess that the show is emotionally appealing on different levels. Chito and Yuuri’s relationship give the impression that no matter how desolate a world can be, there’s hope and joy. Adapting a show like this really takes skill and I am very impressed by the craft the creators applied. As a manga reader, I’m also glad that the anime captured the mood of the show throughout each episode. It’s mostly faithful and really does a solid job at selling its ideas.<br />
<br />
White Fox has been experimenting with a variety of genres recently. To make this anime really needed effort as adapting a desolate world is no easy task. Thankfully, I can say that they did a stellar job at adapting the visual quality of the show. The atmospheric feel really hits the marks with designs of the city ruins, cultural objects, and even weapons. Kettenkrad is a tank that people can relate to our modern world while the weapons such as rifles are visually realistic. The most interesting part is perhaps the character designs of Chito and Yuuri. The two look like characters from a cartoon. Some viewers might not be too keen on accepting them but it should be recognized that they are more complex than they appear. This is expressed through their character expressions. There’s no succinct way to put it but the two really draws a line between abnormal and normalcy. Their expressions evoke emotions from laughter, sadness, and curiosity. To note, there’s also some fan service but viewers should overlook that as those parts stand as a foil to the despair of this desolate world. You’d think these girls would be dressed like they are child soldiers read to go to war but in reality, they just live life.<br />
<br />
I can’t say this enough but the soundtrack is stunningly beautiful. Music composer Kenichiro Suehiro shows his craft through the simplistic yet very convincing OST for this show. The melancholic tone with the eerie vibe every episode gives off matches perfect with the setting. Not to mention, I’m also impressed by the avant-garde style of the theme songs. It’s unique with a catchy tone that’s hard to miss. Finally, praise should be given to the two main heroines. It only took one episode to convince myself that Chito and Yuuri’s voices matches perfectly with their personalities.<br />
<br />
I’ve watched this show several times during its duration and it still feels like I only scratched the surface. Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou is a rare anime that took on a peculiar premise and turned it into a near masterpiece. It has the ability to get viewers invested without an overlaying plot. The characters are deceptively complex. With a world setting filled with mystery, it’s no wonder you can find yourself lost. Don’t worry though. It won’t be like one of those trekking trips where you get drenched in fear. No, it’s a show that breathes life into such a post-apocalyptic world.

    We can be in the presence of a deja-vu, an anime about children (I used that words before).  Could it surprise us as Made in the Abyss did? Will we feel empathy with those kids in a post-apocalyptic world? The truth is that we can be surprised one more time. <br />
<br />
We live our lives hastily surrounded by numerous technological devices. We consider that our daily tasks, such as eating and taking a shower, are &quot;habitual,&quot; and we never asked ourselves what would happen if life change due to destruction and a terrible war. What would happen if we lose those things? What would we

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265963">
        do to survive? Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou takes us to a time where civilization disappeared because of war. The only memory of the existence of the culture lies in the numerous ruins of cities and the devices that once served humans. The animation captivates us with an incredible story of friendship, trust and the constant struggle to survive. Day after day the actions of two girls are a ray of hope in a desolate world.<br />
<br />
The story 9<br />
<br />
The world is a hostile, challenging and sometimes somber place. The constant struggle between nations led to chaos and destruction where countless lives were lost. The war took to oblivion the meaning of the civilization that once existed. The bonds of this condemned world are reflected in the few survivors who day after day must be scavengers to obtain a supply that can prolong their existence in a dead world and thus give meaning to their lives<br />
<br />
Two girls, Chito and Yuuri, wander in the middle of the solitude, the ruins and the deteriorated structures of what was once a society. In the same way, they struggle to find their daily sustenance. A simple ration bar could be a treasure, a place to bathe would be a longed-for dream. In summary, all the dreams changed for the constant struggle to survive. Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou&#039;s story has an incredible context that could make you remember writings from Martin Heidegger and Jean-Paul Sartre that talk about human existentialism. In the same way, the story leads this duo to question about life, death and human nature. <br />
<br />
These girls have dreams, feelings, fears that are exposed in each episode and are perceived by the spectators. They transform a simple rain into a musical festival and maintain a high level of optimism that we can observe in the various actions, games, and jokes that they make throughout the plot. However, you can ask yourself if one day you will find an answer to what happened to the world and if these girls will live long enough to grow and have a happy life if there is one.<br />
<br />
The setting of Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou is excellent. The anime portrays the scars of a war that happened a while ago. Abandoned buildings, rusty pipelines that vanish in the shade as the last sign of life and in the midst the survivors. Elements such as the environment show the catastrophic scenario that these girls have to endure in order to survive day after day. Maybe those details add more realism to the story.<br />
<br />
Something you can notice is the constant need to move, climb and reach higher levels. We can compare that world with a spiral without an apparent end. What will they find in the higher levels? What difficulties will appear? Moreover, the world is full of mysteries, one of them is the reason for the war, another the &quot;statues&quot; that arise during the adventure that perhaps are part of a higher purpose and a camera that keeps the records of the lost memories. <br />
<br />
The most exciting part is how the information is delivered to the viewers. The story advances with these girls and the audience advances with them. The viewer is an active part of the story since it depends on these girls and is not a simple observer. The story has good pacing it has a lovely narrative that will keep you hooked until the end. <br />
<br />
Sometimes, for a lot of spectators is difficult to sympathize with children or to find an animation about children engaging. However, this duo maintains the innocence of their age no matter what problems they have had. They still act like little girls in a devastated world. Yes, I know that, under certain circumstances, they must make decisions as adults, but I liked that they still have dreams, that they question everything and that they want to discover new things. In other words, they are not adults, Chito and Yuuri still have a childhood to live. For example, I will always remember when Yuuri tried to draw Chito in the diary. That kind of moments matches the innocence and youth of the characters that sooner or later will have to mature. Finally, the series highlights several ideas such as friendship, trust, the need to be together to survive. What would they do if one of them were in danger near death? <br />
<br />
Pitifully, the story does not conclude entirely. Maybe we will need to wait some time to see a full conclusion. However, the final episode could give you a partial completion where the emotions (sadness, love) were present. It will reveal some mysteries and facts that we were suspecting.  <br />
<br />
Characters 9<br />
<br />
The most delightful couple of the season. Chito and Yuuri could be very different, but they care for each other. Moreover, they are in a constant fight to survive, but they maintain the innocence of a child that isn&#039;t corroded by the war or any other event. <br />
<br />
Chito. She is the brain of the group, she takes smart decisions but also is very fragile and has some fears. She likes to read and writes a journal. Also, she keeps the duo working for a higher cause, surviving or maybe feeding Yuuri. <br />
<br />
Yuuri. She is the muscle and the comedian of the group also is a good shooter. You can see her as Chito&#039;s guardian. Her humor is fantastic she can make us forget about that desolated world with her actions and jokes. For example, it was hilarious when Chito comment to Kanazawa &quot;she burns others books,&quot; and Yuuri&#039;s expression was pretty amusing.  <br />
<br />
Art 8<br />
<br />
Each episode offers excellent detail and artistic quality. However, some CGI can be observed in some camera angles (mostly on the Kettenkrad motorbike), but they are not so strange and do not damage the narrative. Also, the series has an intelligent use of lighting. You can feel that the world is gone. The light is contrasted each scene showing the designs where the decadent world (rusty pipes), abandoned machinery, weapons. The camera angles used in the scenes are correct and keep the eyes occupied in the critical parts of the narrative and the main characters.<br />
<br />
The characters&#039; design is not very detailed. Moreover, they are a bit simple, they follow a chibi art, for some persons they have a mocking style, but I liked it in general, and it helps to have a better idea of ​​the personalities of the main characters.<br />
<br />
Sound 9<br />
<br />
The sound is pretty amazing. I am a bit amazed by the score; it can compete with Made in the Abyss. Also, the track rises the climax of each episode. For example, the central theme (Episode 1, Ending) adds the concept of mystery and innocence to the story. The sound mix is excellent, you can feel with your senses the desolation and the ruins because the sound boosts the ambiance and the characters actions. <br />
<br />
The OP is very catchy, has a constant rhythm where you can see some traits of the main characters, and it has interesting lyrics. About the ED, it isn&#039;t as good as the OP but in general is a good song. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9<br />
<br />
In each episode, I expected to see answers to some mysteries, and I was waiting for what this pair would find. I wanted to follow the story. However, maybe the plot has some problems since we will not have all answers to all questions and there is no real ending that reveals us the future of this unique duo because the manga is still in progress. No matter this issue I liked how this pair acted and tried to find answers to philosophical questions such us life and death, and the reason for the existence.<br />
<br />
Overall 9<br />
<br />
Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou was a surprise. In my case, I want to see the answers to the mysteries, I want to understand more about what happened to that desolate world and, above all, I want to see if these girls will survive the adventure in this world. Unfortunately, I&#039;ll have to wait a while for that, and I&#039;m sure you will have similar feelings towards this magnificent story because you will see it regardless of my recommendation.<br />

    Girls’ Last Tour is one of the easiest masterpieces to drop, or worse yet, finish and have entirely missed the point of. Its visual presentation does such a clever job at obfuscating the story’s deeper, darker meaning, you’d hardly be at fault for consuming it as the cute girl show which is most certainly is ostensibly and taking none of its valuable messages to heart. I mean, whether you find yourself here because you saw a gif of a moe girl dabbing or because you’re genuinely interested in watching the show, you probably didn’t come because you were invested in exploring its theming on inevitable

        death which its suicidal creator subtly imbued it with.<br />
<br />
When this work first made an appearance in my life, it was not as an anime, but as a manga. This manga was said to be straight boring, a story with all the pleasant fluff one could ask for but no real depth worth remembering it for, and because this was said by an individual whom I know to be intelligent enough to recognize slice of life shows populated by moe blobs still have the ability to be smart and meaningful, I took this appraisal as gospel and promptly forgot about its existence. Having since gone back to have a look for myself, I now appreciate the manga as a powerfully symbolic, deeply emotional life changer which weaves the bleak take on humanism of Texhnolyze throughout the throughly enchanting and metaphorically charged setting of Blame with the elegant tone and soothing pace of Mushishi, with just as many breathtaking displays of artistry. <br />
<br />
While the anime does not find the manga’s conclusion wherein the point becomes clear and finishes arguing itself, that which the adaptation does get to is brought to the screen like an absolute dream. The background art is nothing short of masterful, and its brilliant landscapes are only complemented by the perfectly balanced, minimalistic color design. The music knows how to build an atmosphere like you would not believe, and should you let your guard down, it can just as deftly send a waterfall of tears streaming down your face before you’ve even identified the complex emotions welling up inside you. This is one of those rare anime which ran the risk of looking too good. Should this have been picked up by titans like Production IG or perfectionists like Kyoto Animation, the result would’ve been lavish enough to betray the modest an intentional drabness of the setting, and what we got was the absolute ideal.<br />
<br />
And I know I really came out swinging by dropping the narrative’s heavy theming, but like any work which actually has the expertise to approach such topics properly, Girls’ Last Tour handles its topics of cold misery almost entirely via nuanced, deceptively mature subtext. I could spell it out for you, as—anyone who’s braved my suicide note of a profile page knows—I’m about as far along this line of thought as tsukumizu herself, the depressed creator I alluded to, but I kind of feel like that would undermine the point. If there’s one thing I can say this mindset has taught me whilst killing me slowly, it’s the fact so called &quot;normies&quot; don’t need to understand it, and those who understand it don’t need an excuse to entertain it any more than they may’ve already. Should you do you part as viewer and take the show to heart, and the show then makes you feel something, it did its job, and if it doesn’t, it didn’t fail, and you probably really enjoyed yourself.<br />
<br />
If you were here for those dabbing memes, however, then I thank you for indulging my sneakily overemotional analysis, and I’m happy to tell you the cast of cutesy little characters will do those gifs all due justice. Just as their adorable art design suggests, Chito and Yuuri are to die for, and the two side characters which make up the remaining cast totaling at a minuscule four characters are equally endearing if not quite as visually lovable. If you&#039;re looking for some hardened men, killer action sequences, mind breaking cliffhangers, brutal action sakuga, and most importantly NO MOE, then this is certainly not for you, but if you&#039;re looking for literally anything else, I promise Girls&#039; Last Tour will have something to offer you, be it a quaint slice of life following two characters you can’t help but love or a brutal reflection on your existential dread and despondence with life which you can find embedded in the haunting thematic undertones.<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading.

    Let me make it clear that I will now write a lot about how this anime left me feeling, and reasons for it... Reasons for why many people like myself like this show so much...<br />
[There will probably be quite heavy spoilers]<br />
<br />
So let me begin with saying that this show really left me feeling with the &quot;void&quot; feeling after finishing it, the type of feeling of... seeing something so true (if that makes any sense). It goes over some very dark ideas throughout the whole series which might at first be quite apparent but there&#039;s way more if one cares to delve deeper.<br />
<br />
In the show we

          <span style="display: none;" id="review306497">
        are shown what only seems to be a destroyed world far into the future, not a single type of plant or animals are still alive and at no point in the show do we see foliage of any kind, instead, we see the world covered in metal presumably to make it easier to live on for humans, to basically, create a &quot;perfect&quot; home for those living on it. Of course the dreams of life are rarely no more and with great cities destroyed the way it is in the show, it becomes almost impossible to live.<br />
<br />
I think one important part of the show that I feel makes a lot of people like it, is duo to how mysterious it is. We aren&#039;t really told what destroyed the planet more than subtle hints every now and then and it really never explain things in the story, yet even though this is true, it feels like everything has a reason, it feels like everything has a backstory that makes sense. They&#039;ve created a world that seems so believable it might as well be our earth.<br />
<br />
By having such rare encounters with people in the series, it creates something I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve almost ever seen in a different show... It&#039;s the feeling of isolation in a world were millions and billions of people once roamed the earth. This creates not specifically a suspension each type they meet a new person, but almost as if a new hope, something which the 2 main characters seem to lack more and more the more they go on.<br />
<br />
Also when speaking about lack of hope, Yuuri, one of the main characters, keeps singing a tune about no hope, but she doesn&#039;t sing it in a way that&#039;s specifically sad but almost as if happy and cheerful. I think it&#039;s quite obvious to say that she isn&#039;t &quot;happy&quot; with everything being the way it is now, but more so, trying to make time pass while creating a mood. In such desperate times there&#039;s no real need to make it any worse, therefore this could be her (like we also see her do in many other ways) to try to cheer up Chito (the other main character).<br />
<br />
To be completely honest, it is really hard to explain this story without seeing it with your own eyes. I&#039;ve had many people tell me and other reviews say that &quot;literally nothing happened in the show&quot;, which if you&#039;re one of these people I believe you misunderstood the reason this show is so loved. It&#039;s not because it very specifically gets to a goal at the end, but exactly because it doesn&#039;t. They wander the earth with basically no real confidence and hope, and that&#039;s exactly what they get.. they get a endless world filled with nothing but metallic buildings destroyed and a reminder that they too will soon enough join this rubble.<br />
<br />
One show that I could say is kind of similar to this is &quot;Made in Abyss&quot;, another one of the series I&#039;ve given a 10 (I haven&#039;t given many shows a 10). Both aren&#039;t scared to really show how the real world is, everything doesn&#039;t always have to end well and things don&#039;t always have to coincidentally happen just so the main characters of the show can continue on a mission, this is one idea that sparks life in both of the these shows and gives them a sense of relatability.<br />
<br />
I find myself often listening back to the songs from the series, for example the opening, the opening itself has quite a happy tone, yet each time I listen to it, I almost shed a tear, remembering the greatness which is this show, it means more to me than I could possibly convey.<br />
<br />
This show is easily a 10/10 for me, in fact I&#039;d like to give it a higher score. If you haven&#039;t seen this show (then sorry for spoiling some basics of it, but you will certainly still enjoy it) then you really should check it out! &quot;Don&#039;t watch anime with your eyes closed&quot;

    Wow this show is dull.. I thought this was gonna go a similar direction as Made in Abyss with misleadingly cute art and a slow paced start before the show gets more dramatic, but this show never does ANYTHING. There&#039;s no characters, no humor, no story, no motivations, no drama..<br />
<br />
The only thing the show has going is that there&#039;s seemingly a rather rich backstory / lore to it, but it&#039;s never actually used for anything. <br />
<br />
The art and sound is also very obviously cheap.<br />
<br />
Maybe you&#039;ll enjoy this if you like slow paced shows about nothing like Mushishi or Flying Witch, but atleast those shows have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266803">
        stuff happening and characters..<br />
<br />
I honestly don&#039;t think Girls Last Tour has ANYHTING going for it. It&#039;s not offensive or terrible in any way either, it&#039;s just critically boring.

    It&#039;s basically Aria if Amano Kozue read a lot of positive nihilistic philosophy. The world has ended and everything that we once held dear has been rendered a moot point? Who cares, life&#039;s still worth living anyways. Look at that gorgeous sunset over there, or this snowman I made on top of your head and used a bullet for a nose. I find it to be very uplifting and inspiring. The ability of life to adapt and overcome in the face of overwhelming adversity.<br />
<br />
You might also note that I rated this a perfect 10/10 so yeah, I&#039;m not exactly unbiased about my opinion of this

    Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou - Series Review<br />
<br />
	What if there really was a world where you and your very best friend were supposedly the only two people left in the world after a post-war society? How would that feel, being with the one and only person you ever wanted to be with until you die, experiencing hardships, connections, good times, and everything in between? Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou gives me an idea of how that would feel and for some reason that idea has kept popping back up in to my head. You and your friend are just lost in what seems like an endless “sandbox world” to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265994">
        yourselves, maybe even seeing people along the way. There’s always that tense feeling of not knowing what you will see next or what’s waiting for you in the near or distant future. Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou may not be seen as the best anime series ever by most people, but to me, I felt a connection. A connection with the environment, the characters, and the dialogue… everything. I want to explain why this is my favourite series of all time without being biased. This is all my opinion, and I hope that you can understand why this is the best anime I have watched as of the time I have made this review.<br />
<br />
	The story is set in stone right from the first episode. Chito and Yuuri are supposedly the last two people left in society, maybe even the last living organisms in society. Everyday they rely on what they learned from what they found the day before. They are always finding new things to discover, and the show really pulls you in from what they find each episode. In this post-war apocalyptic environment, you’d expect quite a melancholy of a story if anything, with the whole story being about how the last two people left in the world only have the small things that are ahead of them to look forward to. That’s not the case for Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou. In fact, Chito and Yuuri’s journey is fairly merry and joyful. Most of the experiences that are bad overshadow the good because of how short the bad moments last. It makes this show much more enjoyable and shows that all the sad moments in life should only last such a small amount of time, and you should only focus on the best parts of it. That’s what I love about this show. Maybe you have depression, and you really connected with this show. That’s basically the same case for me; I think that this show tells you that even if life is hard at times, nice things still happen, and you should shift your focus on those nice things. Then, your life will be much happier. Chito and Yuuri had left their parents from a society that seems to have no backstory other than that, making it raise a lot of questions and makes this anime more mysterious as it goes on. Who knows what could have happened to that society besides the fact that it was most likely torn down by war? To be honest, anime that propose a question or have mystery elements to them are some of my favourite aspects of anime in general.<br />
<br />
	White Fox is known for being really experimental with what they make and they always love to reach out to new genres. They have made a lot of amazing anime and I appreciate how hard they work on making things perfect. Steins;Gate was an amazing anime for me and it’s honestly unforgettable. They also made some other really great series like Katanagatari, Akame ga Kill, Re:Zero, Gochuumon wa Usagi desu ka, Hataraku Maou-sama, and probably more. Of course, Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou adds to the amount of great series they have made. Their way of adapting Tsukumizu’s art style was perfect and it feels like Tsukumizu could have even made the anime herself if she could. The landscape and scenery stand out a ton in many episodes and attention to detail in scenes that need to be pointed out as the most important parts are absolutely stellar, hell, maybe I can even call it flawless. I have this attachment to how cute the style of the characters are and it makes me happy everytime I see them. White Fox just did really good at making this anime adaptation and I’m so glad they did.<br />
<br />
	Chito and Yuuri are characters that feel real in a way that makes it very relatable to many people. They are almost like opposites to each other, and their interactions display many different emotions and they clearly are happy that they are together in this end of the world society. It makes me wonder how it would feel like if me and my best friend were in a society quite like the one in Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou. Chito is the character that worries a lot about what’s ahead and does repairs to the Kettenkrad. She seems to be a lot more of a survivalist than Yuuri is, but her personality is really adorable. Yuuri is the carefree and happy go lucky character, and honestly the one that you can have more of a connection with. She may be a bit greedy, but she can be really wise and she reminds Chito that the world isn’t always full of tension and despair. There’s always something to look forward to and you need to see more things positively. Both Chito and Yuuri make the plot of this story and I couldn’t ask for more. Their opposites attract, and it makes watching this anime just amazing, especially when it gets meaningful and emotional.<br />
<br />
	I really want to point out how beautiful the soundtrack is to this anime. Some tracks are quite sad and depressing, and some are really, really happy. However, the part that really stands out the most for me is how each of the tracks sound. It’s a beautiful and unique soundtrack, and I haven’t heard such an amazing soundtrack since Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica and Made in Abyss. The passion used to make this original soundtrack is just beyond my own comprehension, because it sounds perfect in my ears. Kenichiro Suehiro took many different elements of music and combined them to make the soundtrack for this anime, and he did it near flawlessly. The soundtrack is used so precisely on the perfect moments and it makes the vibe of each part of the anime feel so good. Whenever Chito and Yuuri are in a dark area, a more calm or eerie song plays. Whenever they discover something amazing or they look out into the distance and see the beauty of the layered city, a song that will make the scene so much more emotional plays. That’s what I love about this OST, it’s just perfect to me.<br />
<br />
	This anime is so powerful even after a first time watch. I want to rewatch this so many times, I bet won’t ever get tired of seeing how amazing this is. The meaning behind Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou probably goes far beyond what I feel like it already is. This anime is such a rare find today that there’s almost nothing like it, even now. This may just be one of the most unique anime ever made and I appreciate White Fox for it. The amount of time and dedication to make this anime amazing is beautiful. I felt happiness, sadness, emotional connections, and all the meaningfulness from this show just go right into my head, never to come back out because it’s so worth it to keep these memories in my head after watching this. The complexity of Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou is so deep that maybe even if I watched 10 times I couldn’t find out the true meaning. I just stick to what I think it’s about and I’m happy that I think of it that way because it makes the viewing experience so much more enjoyable. There hasn’t been a single anime like this one that I’ve watched before and it’s the most unregrettable and unforgettable experience I have ever had watching anime. My opinion may be biased compared to most, but I felt too many great emotions when watching this.<br />
<br />
Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou is my favourite anime.<br />

    What makes a good post-apocalyptic story?<br />
<br />
The atmosphere. A dense and foreboding feeling that life was at one time much greater than it is today, but now all that’s left is a hollow shell of a former civilization that you’ll never be a part of. What makes the story of Girls&#039; Last Tour (AKA Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou) great is not just the slice of lifestyle plot. It’s the storytelling that makes it great. <br />
<br />
As Chito and Yuri explore the desolate city they learn more things about the setting, which in turn gives the audience useful information to piece together the setting. The world they live in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265971">
        is implied to be Earth in the distant future after a war has wreaked havoc than all but left the world barren. Chi and Yuu spend each episode exploring, looking for supplies, and finding new aspects to their world that they had never known before. The show implies that they were born after the war because of the director’s impressive ability to tell us about the characters in subtle ways. Whether it be the way that they react to finding something that would seem normal to people like us. For example, They find a fish at one point and are only able to identify it based on distant memories. From that simple interaction, we have enough information to infer that they have never seen live fish and most likely a body of water. <br />
<br />
Little details like this are all over the show. You’ll constantly be learning about the world of Girl’s Last Tour without a single line of exposition. <br />
I was impressed from beginning to end because of the well-executed story. Girl’s Last Tour understands that there’s beauty in simplicity and it shows us its understanding at any chance it gets.<br />
<br />
The overarching plot is relatively simple and could be categorized as a slice of life by some standards. In every episode the girls go somewhere new, they’re constantly driving after all. They make pit stops at a place each episode to refuel or just to investigate a new location. We gain insight as to what Chi and Yuu know and comprehend about the world through their various pit stops. The two main characters Chi and Yu are the base of the show, if you don’t like their chibi designs or their childish personalities then chances are you won’t enjoy Girl’s Last Tour. For me, their childish look and goofy banter between one another made the show incredibly pleasant despite taking place in a desolate post-apocalyptic world. The fact that they’re able to joke about<br />
<br />
Even though their personalities are incredibly basic I did appreciate well defined they are. From the first episode, you’ll have a good understanding of who they are and why they are the way they are. The worst issue with Girl’s Last Tour (AKA; Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou) is how wildly inconsistent the characters’ knowledge is. For example; in one scene Yuu says she didn’t know that the Earth spun, yet in the same scene she displayed an understanding of geometry. In another scene, Karma is mentioned by the girls yet in a previous episode they had no idea what a church was… It was like the show was actively telling me to ignore all of the experiences they had gone through over the course of the show. I felt like it wanted me to just embrace the characters as cute cardboard cutouts meant to be laughed at rather than studied. Throughout their journey, they meet a number of enigmatic inhabitants of the city, all of which have interesting information to provide to the girls, and the audience.<br />
<br />
Frequently CGI is used for the car that they drive, but the world has an undeniably arresting aesthetic. It’s a bleak world with a color palette consisting of mostly black, white, brown, and grey, but there is beauty in the lighting and plentiful use of shadows. While the visuals may not inspire as much imagination as a show like Made in Abyss does, they still tell a story. One of the best ways the director tells a story through visuals is his obsession with stairs. And I mean that in the best way possible. Every time the characters are shot climbing up in their little car there is a double meaning to the scene. The further they rise the more they learn about their world. In the very first scene of the show, the lead characters are introduced in a dark cavern driving along as they always do. By simply shooting the characters in a visually interesting factory, the director does an amazing job of establishing that the story is about these childish characters and their journey to becoming adults.<br />
<br />
To complement the empty world and the mystical atmosphere is a mellow soundtrack. I do love the music, but it’s really underused. Many scenes have no music at all. Just background noises that add a bit to the atmosphere and believability of the show’s world. The whirr of the car engine, the clinking of metal, and the well-performed voices of Chi and Yuu are what make up much of the show’s ambient sounds. Thanks to the great voice actresses of the lead characters their personalities come across really well without the show ever needing to tell us explicitly about who the characters are. The show is effortlessly enjoyable thanks to the voices. Small inflections in their voices are enough to figure out what they’re thinking without requiring any unnecessary dialogue to explain things. <br />
<br />
I can’t really complain too much that the soundtrack was underused because the best songs were saved for the best scenes. During these titular moments the melancholy soundtrack rises in volume until it becomes the only thing you can hear, it does a great job of hammering home the impact of some important scenes. <br />
<br />
The show lives and breathes the phrase, “The journey is more important than the destination.” Even though it is a slice of life show, you’re constantly being given details about the setting through Chito and Yuu as they learn more about the world on their journey. Some of the shenanigans they get into are funny. However, don&#039;t expect a comedy because it&#039;s mostly just a cute and uplifting tone that keeps it enjoyable. There are very few jokes. Which is totally fine because it would probably drain all of the tension from the moody atmosphere. <br />
<br />
An interesting setting and fantastic visual storytelling make Girl’s Last tour immediately worth watching. Whether or not you will be immersed in the world of Girl’s Last Tour depends on how interested you are in the world and the journey the lead characters undergo. It’s so content with simply being happy and heartwarming that I didn’t feel like it was missing much. The atmosphere is dense and the mysterious setting offers something more substantial for you to chew on, which is good because I like my slice-of-life shows with at least a little bit of meaningful content.

    This is a fine example of what I think more anime should be like.<br />
Wait. Never mind. It wouldn&#039;t be as special.<br />
Girls&#039; Last Tour really is a gem. It&#039;s an atmospheric post-apocalyptic slice of life. I&#039;ve been hoping for one of these for years. Now that it&#039;s here it does not disappoint.<br />
<br />
Story 6/10<br />
This one isn&#039;t a story driven show. There isn&#039;t much of a plot or goal for them but the show is about the two girls and what they experience. If there was a story I&#039;d probably be giving this thing a good ol&#039; 10/10. But this is what it is and I wouldn&#039;t change

Art 10/10<br />
Initially seeing the art for Made in Abyss I really didn&#039;t like it. I didn&#039;t like Made in Abyss either. This has sort of the same style: the squishy formless chibi-like characters. Usually, you wouldn&#039;t associate that with a post-apocalyptic show but it does sort of carve its own path for what it wants to be. Tl;dr characters are cuties.<br />

Sound 9/10<br />
Those opening and endings always make me smile. <br />

Enjoyment 9/10<br />
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh pretty damn good.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
9/10<br />
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh pretty damn good. Keep these sorts of shows up.

    Imagine you could take a step back for a moment, and take a long, hard look at humanity. Where will we be in 1,000 years? Are the issues we face in the present really that important in the grand scheme of things? What does it mean to live? If our civilisation comes to an end one day, will it really be that bad?<br />
<br />
Girl Last Tour is a unique take on post-apocalyptic fiction and in my view one of the most beautiful shows to come out in a long time. The setting might seem bleak and depressing at first glance, and whilst those feelings are present,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266018">
        it’s mostly used as a backdrop for the talking points of the main characters. It might also seem like another Moe, slice-of-life show that has value in its cuteness and not much more, but it’s really much more than that. It’s an abstract journey through history and human culture through the eyes of people who never got to experience it themselves, with a perspective completely detached from our everyday lives and personal drama. It makes you think about how insignificant many of our stresses and quarrels really are in the grand scheme of things and often brings into question the meaning of why we live and do the things we do. Themes like war and human greed are brought up and criticised, just as is the importance of knowledge, keeping records and the preservation of life. In many ways this show is a harsh introspection of ourselves as a species and in many others it’s an optimistic exploration of the beauty of living and learning. More than anything, it&#039;s about finding hope for the future even when the world seems bleak and empty.<br />
<br />
Both the setting and characters are vehicles for the social commentary of this show, and as such don’t end up being particularly interesting in themselves. There’s no grand, overarching plot or a great deal in the way of character development, because that’s not really the point of Girls’ Last Tour. It’s not a show about fictional characters, it’s a show about how we think about the world and ourselves, and it works exceptionally well.

    To those who wonder why I give 10s for everything, I’ll explain why.<br />
<br />
This anime left me speechless and it truly is a diamond that’s shines bright within the animes that I have watched. If you like adventure, moe, drama and a bit of slice of life, I highly, highly recommend you to watch this show.<br />
<br />
[Slight Spoilers Ahead]<br />
<br />
The story is more than amazing, it’s one of those stories that aren’t too generic, but not too unique to the point where you can’t wrap your head around it. The story is simple, two girls left in a futuristic post-apocalyptic world where humans are a rare sight. Their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325430">
        goal? Go up the layers that each cities has. This honestly was an unique story choice created by the author and you won’t see it in any other anime. As the story goes on, it’s quite amazing as the main characters develop. The ending is depressing but it spreads a very moral message about our lives. 10/10<br />
<br />
The art is honestly something that I personally enjoy, you might not like this art style, but that’s alright! The characters are drawn in a more chibi style in comparison to the traditional anime. The background, scenery and motion are very smooth and it’s quite a beauty, in my opinion. 10/10<br />
<br />
Music is almost always reoccurring. And it really enhances the show in a way that it almost makes scenes more emotional. The opening and ending though, they are one of the most cheerful tunes I have heard, I never skip them. This is actually the only anime that I’ve watched that I don’t skip the op and the ed. Cheers to the music production! 10/10<br />
<br />
The characters aren’t your generic, anime girls in popular anime. Sure, they might possess a lot of similar characteristics, but they utilizes unique skills that they have to create diverse but not distant, personalities. For example, Yuuri is a girl who likes using force and not her brain. The authors expressed her personality as she carries a rifle and always wants to eat what ever she comes by that is alive. Chito is a girl who wants to learn about the environment around her. She likes reading and prefers peace over violence. The combo that these two girls often times creates conflicts but they are still good friends at the end. 10/10<br />
<br />
The enjoyments speaks by itself from the previous reviews. It’s awesome, superb. It’s boring, but intense, it’s slow-paced, but can be fast-paced. It perfectly utilizes the mood of each scene and enhances them with other elements. The ending might be bittersweet but who cares? Sadness can leave quite an impression. 10/10<br />
<br />
Overall, this is definitely one of my top three anime, you might disagree with me, but that’s fine. This is my personal opinion. 10/10<br />

    Two chibi girls on a vintage Kettengrad motorbike explore the war-ravaged city that they once called home. This sentence without context sounds ridiculous, but Girls&#039; Last Tour manages to pull it off by providing one of the best shows of the season  with beautiful background imagery, variation between the two leads that mimic those of two sides of a brain, and a soothing yet melancholic soundtrack<br />
<br />
The quality of the backgrounds can be mostly attributed to the widely used post-apocalyptic setting and the source material of the show. Tsukumizu&#039;s elaborate ruined cityscapes of rusted pipes and war-torn steel fully contrast with the two chibi, moe

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266084">
        leads.<br />
<br />
Chito and Yuuri compose the dual leads that this anime relies on to contrast it&#039;s grim setting. If you were to divide the two into the halves of a brain, Chi would be the intellectual right and Yu would be the cheery left. Both care immensely for each other, as seen in the show, and operate almost as one conscious entity. The very design of our two main characters is the antithesis of this show&#039;s setting of a post-apocalypse, something that has been done in other shows such as Made in Abyss. The interactions the two have with each other can only be described as nostalgic, and the soundtrack of this show furthers this by a significant margin.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is very well supplemented with acoustic guitar and vocals among other instruments and is often used to evoke a sense of discovery or nostalgia as the two girls venture throughout the city. The warmth of the guitar clashes with the frigid concrete, providing another point of divergence that fuels the nostalgia train. <br />
<br />
The technical aspect of this show is pretty impressive on its own, but the themes and thought-provoking questions that Chito and Yuuri impose upon the reader also need to be taken into consideration. They might be open-ended but hint towards a deeper learning that is happening as the two girls adventure through the wasteland. The story itself might be disconnected in some regard, but the experiences that our two leads are having could be interpreted as rediscovering what it means to be human. The episode titles contribute to this as well, with simple names like Bath or Friends. <br />
<br />
To conclude, Girls&#039; Last Tour is without a doubt the best show of this winter season, displaying an array of insightful themes with impressive execution. I hope Studio White Fox makes a second season for this gem <br />
<br />

    The very moment this little show starts, you can clearly see it&#039;s going to be special. The story is told in such a gentle and sweet way that despite the serious themes it might be reflecting upon you never perceive any darkness nor violence. Both of the main characters are unique and adorable. Their highly stylized design is a WIN and you truly come to love them. Voice acting is one of the most memorable I&#039;ve heard in animation as well (Japanese)! The places the girls take you around are beautifully haunting and the rest of characters that eventually appear here are brilliantly written. There&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review423304">
        a pretty soothing effect through the episodes (accompanied by precious music) and it constantly grows along with the tenderness of it all. &quot;Girls&#039; Last Tour&quot; feels important to watch and does everything very naturally. I hope everyone can find the chance to enjoy and talk about it a long time after finished.

    I&#039;ve watched almost every anime listed in MAL, but this is my first time i really want to write a review here, special for this pure gem.<br />
<br />
Story: After watching so many anime of course it is so hard to find a new anime with a fresh plot. As listed in synopsys, this anime is about 2 girls journey in post apocalyptic world. What makes the story special is because of the nihilistic life lesson that the girls discuss from what they experience in their journey, meeting new things, people and even robot. <br />
<br />
Character: This probably what makes me falling in love with this anime because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264981">
        of the 2 main characters, Chito and Yuuri. Chito is always try to be rational even though she is so shy. And Yuuri who is so eccentric, and somehow always found a way to almost kill chito accidently. The interaction between the two is pure gem. They help each other to stay positive in the end of the world, where almost nothing is positive.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Well, i am 100% enjoy watching this anime. Even though the atmosphere if this anime is kinda dark kinda similar to Made in Abyss anime, but the Yuuri and Chito interaction always lifted the mood. They discuss heavy life lesson, such as the meaning of life, hope, happiness, and even about God, with simple thought from their experience. Even though i usually don&#039;t like philosophy anime but it doesnt really a bother for me, as they present it lightly and wrap it with comedy from Chito and Yuuri, which always give me smiles afterward.<br />
<br />
Art and sound:<br />
I never grade an anime based on art and sound, because for me the core of anime are the plot/story and characters. <br />
<br />
In term of art I think this anime is pretty good as you could even guess what is in the blurry background perfectly, even people could know the type of war weapon and machine that the duo passed in the journey. Well with the Characters moe blob design, I think this is also perfect to lift the mood and make me reminiscing Hidamari Sketch anime.<br />
<br />
Well, for sound I&#039;m pretty sure this anime has best quality in this section, as I always hear people compare this anime has soundtrack as good as Made in Abyss anime, which is already famous for its soundtrack. Not to mention this anime has Inori Minase as Chito VA, Opening and Ending singer, also there is an insert song where the characters sing together with rain.<br />
<br />
Overall: Probably the best way to describe this anime is: this is the fusion of Made in Abyss, Kino no Tabi, and Hidamari Sketch. <br />
<br />
Out of all anime ever made till now, this is my favorite in Slice of Life genre. This anime makes me cry and laugh, give me hope in hopelessness, and teach me that everything will be fine even though nothing is fine.<br />

    In a nutshell: Girls&#039; Last Tour is a beautiful show about two friends travelling somewhere, anywhere, in a broken world.  But even when everything is grey, bleak nothingness, Girls&#039; Last Tour shows us that we can still somehow find joy and bliss simply by being together.  This is a fairly relaxed show.  There is no exciting plot to follow.  There is no daunting enemy that our heroes must somehow conquer with the power in their hearts.  This is a show that is much more about daily life and watching the world outside.  It is the &quot;sitting in a cafe

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265384">
        on a rainy, staring out the window&quot; rather than the &quot;racing down an empty highway in a supercar&quot; kind of show.<br />
<br />
The part I love most about Girls&#039; Last Tour is its emotional strength. <br />
 Combining wonderful art, music, and voicing, it is able to conjure emotion in ways that don&#039;t need to take advantage of the usual feelings-cheap-shots.  And it doesn&#039;t just hit the usual emotional targets of sadness and happiness.  What stuck out to me is the profound sense of wonder, tragedy, and simple bliss that I got over and over again.  These are things that are usually quite hard and unusual to aim for.  It&#039;s difficult to describe, but this show yanks on my heartstrings like nothing else while not taking advantage of emotional low-blows, if that makes any sense.  However, this is not to say that this is just a serious or depressing anime.  In such a dead world, Chi and Yuu are bright lights of joy and happiness.  There&#039;s plenty of comedy as well, usually due to the antics of one character in particular.  <br />
<br />
Story, other than the fantastic world-building, is non-existent (and not the point).  There are really only mini-plots, but no real major plot other than the tale of the past.  (I&#039;ve rated Story as 9 anyways because I&#039;m a real sucker for mysterious world-building, even if it&#039;s only in the background)<br />
<br />
Using moe chibis juxtaposed on a brutalist landscape is such an amazing contrast.  Art in the show is wonderful.  Though everything is usually grey and rectangular and sharp and mute, it actually never gets old.  The background shapes and environments are always changing.  In a way, the dullness of the world is so much more interesting than the usual fantasy/sci-fi worlds that are wild and brimming with vibrant color.  And when there is color in the world, it is used spectacularly.  Animation is also on point.  The chibi faces are put to good comedic effect.  Animated movement is simple but effective. <br />
<br />
Music and sound design are, simply put, incredible.  It&#039;s hard to describe without a spoiler-ish example, but there are great combinations of songs, sound effects, and art that just put you in awe.  Voicing fits perfectly for each character, and some characters are really just enjoyable to listen to.<br />
<br />
Overall, this is a show that I cannot stop loving.  It is not action-packed.  It does not have romance.  It does not have an incredible rise of a hero against all odds.  It is a wonderful piece of slice-of-life, atmospheric, and emotional art that reminds us that anime doesn&#039;t need intense action or distressing conflict to be great.  I cannot express just how wonderful and amazing this experience is.  <br />
<br />
By the way, even if you don&#039;t end up watching this, I implore you to at least listen to the OST.  Though some songs will not have the same impact without knowing the context, the score is amazing on its own.

    Girls Last Tour seems like an impossible to to tell story that will never work. The story revolves around two young naive girls in a war torn dystopian world and their adventures and experiences through this bleak and colorless world. The main charecters Chito and Yuuri only have each other as well as a vehicle that accompanied them from the beginning of their journey. In this world with culture, people, and knowledge are getting lost to time these two young girls embark on a journey through human history. <br />
  <br />
Almost immediately I feel in love with this art style and story because of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330382">
        antithesis of the characters and world, which admittedly i thought was going to be a huge problem. The reason why i loved this so much is because the chemistry of the two characters almost created a paradox, where when they were on the screen it felt warm, comfortable, and even wholesome where nothing but desolation and destruction exist. To this point, the moe art style, is genius because of the effect it has on the world and the feel of it. The story also intrigued me immediately for two reasons, the first being because a national superpower like Japan getting into a situation where nothing but wreckage remains. The second reason lies with how the world is built into levels similar to that of a building where different floors have different information to offer. The goal for the two girls is too make up to the highest level of the the world they are in.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack and music choice also added so much to this story, from the opening and ending following the trend of the art, being in complete contrast to this world because of the upbeat nature of it. This again is the genius of this anime where it welcomes you in with open arms but will remind you of the dystopia by adding intensity and sadness with music, but also show them creating something more light and joyful out of it like episode 5 where they made music out of the rain. The music to put simply, is beautiful and truly made me feel something. The one that stood out the most was when they played Chopin in the last episode, where the girls get many answers about how the world got to where it was.<br />
<br />
Finally I wanted to talk about the meat and potatoes, the writing. The writing is incredibly strong. The emphasis on learning and curiosity truly made this a fulfilling watch. The girls slowly recording their experiences from learning what cheese is, too discovering and learning about the religion that was practiced before they arrived. The attention to detail when emphasizing religion helped not only keep me curious but, made the ending that much more impactful. Overall, the writing was tight and clever.   <br />
<br />
My final thoughts on this show is that it is 100% worth the watch. Every part this show was great and with great effort. I truly believe that this anime will give you something meaningful after the watch while also allow you to enjoy a great adventure.

    The only reason I&#039;m writing a review is due to the overwhelming positive response of this show. This show tries to sell itself by being deep and meaningful through their characters asking questions such as &quot;why do we live&quot; etc. Just because you ask that question DOESN&#039;T MEAN THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU&#039;VE ADDED DEPTH TO THE SHOW. I tried to give it a shot but halfway through the season it just get&#039;s repetitive. There is no progress, no set goal or drive to the show or characters. Don&#039;t try and tell me that&#039;s the point since there is nothing left to the world

          <span style="display: none;" id="review269990">
        after the war, because then this show should&#039;ve ended at episode 1. A short film would&#039;ve been more effective.<br />
<br />
This anime is pointless, Nothing happens. It would&#039;ve been better of as a movie. Don&#039;t waste your time, you won&#039;t receive any fulfilment.

    Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou started in 2014 as a manga by Tsukumizu. In 2017 our old acquaintances at White Fox adapted it into an anime. Yes, the same studio that did the shitty Goblin Slayer, the mediocre Zero Kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho and the enjoyable Gochuumon wa Usagi desu ka. I can&#039;t really predict quality based off of their prior works, so let&#039;s delve right in. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Chito and Yuuri are two young girls wandering across a desolate, bleak landscape trying to survive and make the most of their situation. The series basically follows their encounters with various relics of the past and their philosophical discussions. <br />
<br />
The biggest

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332058">
        issue with this anime is the ending. It&#039;s rushed and it has some content that contradicts what we&#039;ve already seen in the series. The pacing can also be somewhat slow at times. And the back story elements are a little weak.<br />
<br />
What this series does really well is the juxtaposition. The key to this lies with the hopelessness of the landscape against the bright exuberance of our heroines. The world is basically dead with very little signs of humanity but our heroines keep things very light-hearted and always find ways to enjoy themselves. Which is an interesting choice but it works since nothing too depressing happens to either of them. Their discussions can also be really interesting and there are some compelling scenarios for the pair. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Chito &amp; Yuuri are both strong characters with a good amount of complexity. Their dynamic is strongly put together. They encounter two other humans during their journey. Both of whom are fairly interesting, given our limited time with them. The issue is really with the non-human characters who show up towards the end and don&#039;t make much sense. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The artwork has the same kind of juxtaposition as the series itself. The backgrounds are highly detailed, barren and can really create an atmosphere as solitude and desolation. In contrast, Chito &amp; Yuuri have a bright, almost moe design. Which reinforces the idea that they&#039;re the proverbial ray of light in a desolate landscape. Or maybe it&#039;s just an inability to draw humans normally. We can say that if we want to be uncharitable. <br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
<br />
Both Minase Inori &amp; Kubo Yurika excel in this series. You might say it would be hard to cast badly when the bulk of your acting is being done by two people, but they definitely nailed the casting. The music is quite nice. Suehiro Kenichiro definitely did better with this than he did with Goblin Slayer. <br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
Overall, Chito and Yuuri have a more familial dynamic than a homo-erotic one, but there are definitely moments when they come across as a couple. <br />
<br />
Areas of Improvement:<br />
<br />
Explain your magical creatures that don&#039;t make much sense. This is the big problem with the ending.<br />
Pick up the pace a bit. I get that you&#039;re trying to build atmosphere, but there&#039;s a point where it&#039;s too slow and this series certainly reaches that.<br />
Build up the back story a little more. I&#039;m not saying we need to know how the world got to be in its current state, but we could definitely benefit from knowing more about Chito &amp; Yuuri&#039;s lives before they set out on their journey.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t say this is the best White Fox production I&#039;ve seen. However, it is a good work with some strong atmosphere, interesting juxtaposition and compelling characters. A kind of shit ending and some other narrative issues definitely weaken it somewhat. But I&#039;ll still give it a solid 7/10.
