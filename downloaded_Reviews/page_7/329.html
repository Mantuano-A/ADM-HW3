    Non Non Biyori Repeat for a lot of people was the anticipated second season to continue the light hearted atmosphere the first season created, but its become more than that. The &quot;Repeat&quot; in the name is a great way to define the sequel (if we can even call it that). If one were to ask about the entire season of Repeat, they&#039;d be given with a new approach to the actual first season. Kind of confusing, yet still genius to redefine what we think of the anime and create a stronger bond between character and audience than before. <br />
<br />
The greatest aspect of this is the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199180">
        idea is that if someone hasn&#039;t seen the first season of Non Non Biyori, they won&#039;t be left out due to the idea of this being an alternative styled season. Though on the other hand, if you&#039;ve seen the first season, you&#039;re given more time to spend with the characters, and as we visit their small village for another year&#039;s duration within a time span of 12 episodes, many more relations can be established. The layout and premise of &quot;Repeat&quot; seems to be more character oriented and driven, and that allows for the merry group of four to be fleshed out and come to know them as if we&#039;ve spent our time along side with them creating memories. All of the four are relatable in certain aspects that probably we&#039;ve all done at some point in our life: Creating games out of school supplies, playing with the fun of nature, like blowing whistles from leaves, and the want for a pet to raise.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly enough, the anime tackles the idea of city versus country. Renge&#039;s sister Hika-nee (or Hikage) is always getting a chance to share her experiences in the big city life in Tokyo when she&#039;s back at home with the rest of the main cast, while Hotaru is constantly finding new joys about the fun one can have with nature and the embodiment of a humble life style. Both of them are enjoying themselves in a setting where they didn&#039;t really grow up in, and aren&#039;t very accustomed to, but they&#039;re basking in the full glory of what they both have to offer, and seemingly don&#039;t dread being where they are. <br />
<br />
One thing to note is the way the characters are presented in the actual story, not just this season specifically though. Many shows today, not only anime, present their characters, whether it be one kid or a group, as child prodigies, otakus, and socially awkward people. Though, the main group are represented as just any causal children growing up in their elementary through middle school phase. No one of them is standing out from the rest by skipping grade levels or talking about subjects a child near their age wouldn&#039;t know. They hold the qualities of what makes a child, a child. It&#039;s the realism that is produced from these factors that make the anime more life-like and less one-dimensional.<br />
<br />
✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿ <br />
&quot;Make sure you don&#039;t lose it. It&#039;ll be too late to regret it once you do.&quot; - Komari &quot;Koma-chan&quot; Koshigaya<br />
<br />
Koma-chan, more often than not, is the running gag of being short for one&#039;s age, and at first she might be seen as just that type of character to fill in comedy, but through the development of the entire series, there&#039;s maturity and still a little bit of childish actions, regardless of her being the eldest of the main four. A running concept about her is the fact of wanting to be mature and adult-like rather than being treated like the child she usually is. It can hinder her at times, and make her act beyond what she wants to, but at certain moments she obtains her mature nature and truly takes care of her friends and gains experience to help her in life later. Her development is subtle, but certainly shows improvement in the latter half of the season when she goes through a stage of recollection. Although, what child hasn&#039;t longed for being an adult at one point of their lives? It&#039;s only natural for someone of her age to want be treated older, and it brings out for amusing situations.<br />
<br />
✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿ <br />
&quot;Play while you have a chance is my motto&quot; - Natsumi &quot;Nattsun&quot; Koshigaya<br />
<br />
Nattsun is the tomboyish personality within in the main cast, and the loudest personality of them all. Nothing can overcome her mighty sense of determination, aside from school and tests. Her image at the start of the anime was more or less the typical never-ending energy type of person, but as the season went on, she shows more sides than what can be observed after only a mere few minutes. &quot;What would she look like as a &quot;proper&quot; girl?&quot; is answered, and it just isn&#039;t something that suits her outlook. At times it&#039;s obvious she can be over the top, her playful actions are what brings the meat to the meal that is the show of Non Non Biyori and it is not the same if she weren&#039;t a part of it. Although perhaps the beauty of her character is her relation to real life tendencies people make. Losing objects, impulse actions, and probably her words alone. &quot;What the heck do those &quot;Explain what the author was thinking here&quot; question mean?! I&#039;m not the author! How am I supposed to know?!&quot; These are words and feelings are familiar to students in a multitude and ways, and personally had the same thoughts myself at one point. She&#039;s more than just the &quot;energetic&quot; or &quot;reckless&quot; personality that people may depict her as, and she certainly proved that through the course of the season.<br />
<br />
✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿ <br />
&quot;Take this seriously and say &quot;goo-goo&quot; - Renge &quot;Ren-chon&quot; Miyauchi<br />
<br />
Renge is an interesting character because she can be the perfect example of a typical child. Although she can have her moments of being greater than someone her age in some talents, her one trait sticks true to what can be said about children: Innocence is bliss. Her tendencies gear more and more towards the mindset of a child as time passes and even exemplifies what would happen near her age. Riding a bike, fooled by simple illusions, spontaneous ideas that have no reason to them, the many &quot;wants&quot; of a young child, such as raising a pet. At first she can seem like a bit of an awkward character that seems to be the &quot;cute&quot; image of the group, but she develops into a mindful friend who has unique outlook on her surroundings when things seem a little off, and quickly develops from her experiences that she gains daily with the adventures she does with her peers.<br />
<br />
✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿ <br />
&quot;I&#039;m not that grown-up. I&#039;m just normal. I really act childish in front of my mom, especially. I wish I could be more mature, really.&quot; - Hotaru &quot;Hotarun&quot; Ichijou<br />
<br />
Hotaru is the &quot;foreigner&quot; of the group as she moves in from the bustling city life into a quaint village that has nature as its main attractions. At the beginning of the anime she tends to be more towards the passive type of character who doesn&#039;t really &quot;drive&quot; the story per se, but does make it more enjoyable for the people around her. Her physique is older than she seems, which can make her uncomfortable in certain situations when she receives praise of acting older than how she usually is, but surprisingly is quite childish, and the second youngest of her group of four. She&#039;s relatively positive and rarely negative, and has hobbies of making Koma-chan dolls. Although quite a well-rounded character, her debut slowly approaches and she establishes herself as a more &quot;active&quot; character in pursuing the story as the season progresses. <br />
<br />
✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿ <br />
Even though the characters themselves are great individually, without their interaction as a group, the anime wouldn&#039;t be the same. The comedy brought on is rather light-hearted and can be childish, but relatable for anyone who experienced what they did at one point in time. It&#039;s the idea of the group setting that can push this anime to reach the fullest potential of making it exactly what it is: An anime about four girls and their adventures as friends through their nature filled village. Though what plagues many slice of life is the concept of not putting out enough content to keep the audience attracted for most of the series, and seemingly making it like the episode had nothing happening and very unproductive. Non Non Biyori has a new adventure waiting around every corner for the audience to join in on, bringing in new experiences for the characters to develop, and more chances to make connections and special moments for each one.<br />
<br />
Although the characters themselves are one of the main focuses of the anime, since the setting is located in a little village surrounded by nature, the greenery and locations they often go to is an antidote for sore eyes. Regardless if the scene is a still frame, or a little walk through the forest, the detail in every little thing is made to be left breathless. Water dripping from a leaf giving that immersive feeling of morning dew, the river to dive into and play around, the daily walks to school. Each of those scenes are given just about as much detail as the rest to help the audience be familiar with the character&#039;s home where they grew up in. Even during season changes, the color scheme subtly adapts to fit the tone and atmosphere of the cool welcome of autumn, and the bright appearance of the new year.<br />
<br />
The opening sequence accompanied by the song gives the feeling of a worry free journey for anyone who is a fan of the genre to experience. The march sequence can be a nice depiction of their friendship growing and changing as the seasons pass, through all the days spent in the hot summer stuck doing homework, to the snowy winter days creating igloos. The ending, and even the opening, are similar to the atmosphere they create as the openings for both seasons are performed by nano.RIPE and the ending by the main cast. The endings as a whole are created to be more relaxed and slow compared to their counterpart opening, which provide a nice closure to their long day, and a nice closure to open their eventful opening for the next encounter.<br />
<br />
At the same time, the OST that are played in the background deserve praise for themselves alone. Although a little similar in sound, they each have their own country type of feeling to them when they&#039;re being played in each scene. It&#039;s especially special when each character has certain sound clips added to their scene, such as a recorder song when Renge has a moment, or anything that seems to be suitable to close off a long day with a relaxing tune. The wide range of instruments and sounds used never seem to make it overused, but rather casual, and a delight to hear when they make an appearance.<br />
<br />
While the season may have wrapped up, and the legendary sword being put to an end after its reign has been established, the welcome it gave was all the more special. Our time to spend time with the cast and characters may have been short, but it truly felt like a connection was made after our year of memories made. Opening in the spring with a brand new school year, with a year to look forward to, and closing with the spring to open a new chapter in our life as we graduate and open ourselves to new experiences. I look to the future when we may meet and spend time as a group again, but for now, I&#039;ll keep the new fondly made bonds cherished and hope others will feel the same while watching this.

     ~Multilingual review, English &amp; Español: Non Non Biyori Repeat~.<br />
<br />
The nearest library is away 20 minutes by bike, and a certain popular manga magazine arrives on the shelves Wednesday rather than Monday. The local concept of &quot;market&quot; consists of leaving the merchandise outside in the open air whiteout anyone to look for it, and a normal empty can beside it which main purpose is that of be the &quot;cash register&quot;, if we, perhaps, are in search of normal convenient store (kombini) we could find it 40km away, just recently newly opened by the way. People doesn&#039;t lock up their houses, the roads aren&#039;t paved, there&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199456">
        hardly signal for mobile phones (there are some strategic spots though) and Nature reigns, as an absolute queen, over the entire landscape. The local school is an old building that emanates a sightly impression of being abandoned, and with it&#039;s only 5 students, everyone in different grades, Elementary and Middle School, regrouped in the same classroom and sharing the same teacher, days seems to go by with such slowly peaceful harmony. Ah... don&#039;t forget the candy store that also rent skiing equipment for the winter season, the green hills in the village are perfect for this.<br />
<br />
~Welcome to Asahigaoka~<br />
<br />
If you were to ask me &quot;what&#039;s this anime is about?&quot;, with a confident look, almost like if I were trying to brag about, I&#039;d reply &quot;it&#039;s about some children growing up in the countryside&quot;. Someone who doesn&#039;t know this show would certainly look confused (&quot;dude are you serious?&quot;) but since this is a &quot;second season&quot;, you, who are reading this review, know what I&#039;m talking about, if you don&#039;t, well, let me take a little moment of your time to present you this anime developed in a rural village where 4 particular little girls are living and nothing out of the ordinary ever happens, you&#039;ll find it for sure interesting... Wait don&#039;t believe me?, let me repeat it again, &quot;4 girls in the countryside just living and nothing out of the ordinary ever happens&quot;, yeah, ummm really, that pretty much sums up the entire show. &quot;Did I find it interesting?&quot;, hell yes!, it&#039;s one of the best shows I&#039;ve ever watched and I&#039;m going to brag about it to never end. For those of you who came up to this review whiteout watching the &quot;first season&quot; I need to warn you about something: you probably would like to watch the 2013 version first. <br />
<br />
Non Non Biyori Repeat it&#039;s not really a sequel, but it isn&#039;t exactly the beginning neither, we could call this season a &quot;supplement&quot; to the 2013 version, something like the chocolate chips we add to the pancakes, pancakes are already good by themselves but with the choco chips are better, well that&#039;s practically what Repeat it&#039;s about, it made Non Non Biyori, an already excellent anime, more enjoyable, adding also Nutella and strawberries!... well yeah, enough with sweets, I think you already got what I&#039;m trying to say. Anyway It could&#039;ve been vice versa actually, Repeat the pancake and the 2013 version the choco chips, both of them could be watched &quot;stand alone&quot; and work perfectly fine, but mixing them is way better, and that was the &quot;jump of quality&quot;, something that allowed me upgrade my thoughts about this show, the last 12 episodes weren&#039;t enough for me to give a 10/10, now it&#039;s enough, and I&#039;m really glad for this.<br />
<br />
So when I said that nothing out of the ordinary happens and this show is about 4 girls growing up in the country side, you need to imagine it like that, nothing more, nothing less, simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication after all, but that&#039;s not the only feature of this show.<br />
<br />
&quot;In character, in manner, in style, in all things, the supreme excellence is simplicity&quot;.<br />
<br />
Simplicity could be the best but it&#039;s a &#039;necessary&#039; not &#039;sufficient&#039; condition, in my humble opinion, for a show to that wages all in being &quot;simple&quot; and aims to be considered &quot;good&quot; there are many other requirements that need to be fulfilled. Non Non Biyori managed to do accomplish them, it surpassed plain simplicity by outclassing excellency every single field, from the characters, to the scenery, to the music and animation, in everything. I must confess I&#039;m not able to raise a single complaint, even the tiniest critique, aimed to this anime. Simplicity is the best, I agree, but only if it&#039;s NNB&#039;s level of it, that&#039;s it.<br />
<br />
Actually something that really surprised me about this anime, the one I consider the really &quot;spark of quality&quot;, is the way how it was portrayed the figure of the children. Our main characters behave, act, think and react like a normally child would, and that&#039;s pretty awesome since no other anime I&#039;ve seen actually managed to capture such simple, innocent and natural behavior, succeeding also in the Comedy field, real comedy with children, that&#039;s just too great. In my eyes little kids in other anime are portrayed in such a false and unnatural characterization, I don&#039;t actually enjoy them, don&#039;t you think so too?.<br />
<br />
You never step into the same river twice, greek aphorism &#039;panta rei&#039;, meaning that &#039;everything flows&#039;, nothing remains unvaried, would surely fit what I&#039;m going to say next. Even if &#039;character development&#039; wasn&#039;t a feature in this anime, I&#039;d dare to say our characters changed a bit compared to our last meet, now with the longer time granted, little details unknown to us came to light. Rest assured, such details aren&#039;t that significant, our charismatic girls remains still the same as always. Ichijou Hotaru, 5th grader student, the city girl, in appearance very mature but with a secret childish side that everyone refuse to believe, Koshigaya Natsumi, 7th grader, a tomboyish girl with a bright personality bearing a strong impulse to tease her friends every time the occasion is good, then we&#039;ve Komari, 8th grader, Natsumi&#039;s older sister, the childish girl in the group despite being the older one, she&#039;s always trying to act with a mature behavior she doesn&#039;t own, resulting in embarrassing situations. And the final member, the younger one, Miyauchi Renge, 1st grader, the craziest and bizarre of them all, she&#039;s unpredictable and never ceases to amaze her friends and family, the little star of the show.<br />
<br />
Would you believe me if I say we could consider Asahigaoka Village as a part of the cast too?, the story revolves around and inside it but it&#039;s not merely a background, the atmosphere and the locations in this show represent ones of it&#039;s strong points, the hook of the show itself. Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter, throughout the development of the show we&#039;re able to admire the beautiful scenery this rural village has to offer in each different season of the year, meanwhile harmonically accompanied by a really fit and relaxing OST playing on the sides, an oasis of tranquility is guaranteed.<br />
<br />
So.. do you like pancakes with choco chips, Nuttella and strawberries?, well it&#039;s time to get some and start watching this show about 4 girls living in the countryside where nothing ever happens, I assure you it&#039;s one hell of mix, it&#039;s Bliss.<br />

La librería más cercana está a 20 minutos andando en bicicleta, y cierta famosa revista de manga llega a los estantes el Miércoles en vez del Lunes. El concepto local de &quot;mercado&quot; consiste en dejar la mercancía al aire libre sin nadie que la atienda, mientras que al lado está una lata vacía que sirve de &quot;caja registradora&quot;. Si buscamos una tienda normal para hacer compras, esa la encontramos a 40Km de aquí, que por cierto acaba de abrir recientemente. Las personas no cierran a llave sus casas cuando salen, las calles no están pavimentadas, difícilmente hay señal para el celular (pero hay algunos puntos estratégicos), y la naturaleza reina soberana sobre todo el paisaje. La escuela local es un viejo edificio que da una cierta impresión de abandono, y con sus únicos 5 estudiantes, todos en grados distintos, reagrupados en la misma aula y compartiendo el mismo profesor, los días transcurren con una armoniosa y pacífica lentitud. Ah... no nos olvidemos de la tienda de dulces que también renta equipaje de ski para la temporada invernal, las colinas verdes de este pueblo son perfectas para esto.<br />

~Bienvenidos a Asahigaoka~<br />
<br />
Si me fueras a preguntar &quot;¿de que se trata este anime?&quot;, con una mirada confiada, casi como si estuviera por presumir, respondería &quot;se trata de unos niños que viven su vida en el campo&quot;. Alguien que no conoce esta serie de seguro me miraría con una cara confusa (&quot;bro ¿dices de verdad?&quot;), pero si como estamos hablando de una &quot;segunda temporada&quot;, tú, que estás leyendo esta reseña, sabes de lo que estoy hablando, y si por si caso no lo sabes, bueno, dedícame unos minutos de tu tiempo para presentarte esta serie que se desarrolla en el campo donde 4 niñas viven y no sucede nada de extraordinario, de seguro lo encontrarás de seguro interesante... Espera, ¿no me crees? Déjame que lo repita de nuevo: &quot;4 chicas viviendo en el campo donde no sucede nada de extraordinario&quot;, mmm sí, eso resume bastante bien la serie. &quot;¿Lo encontré entretenido?&quot;, ¡joder sí!: es uno de los mejores anime que he visto y lo presumiré hasta que me canse. Para aquellos de ustedes que se encontraron con esta reseña antes de haber visto la &quot;primera temporada&quot; déjenme advertirles algo: probablemente quieran ver la versión del 2013 primero.<br />
<br />
Non Non Biyori Repeat no es exactamente una secuela, no podemos decir que sea tampoco el inicio, podríamos considerar llamar esta temporada un &quot;suplemento&quot; a la versión del 2013, algo parecido a las chispas de chocolate que le agregamos a los pancakes, los pancakes son buenos ya de por sí, pero con las chispas es mucho mejor; bueno eso es prácticamente Repeat, hizo de Non Non Biyori, un anime ya de por sí excelente, más entretenido y agradable, ¡agregando también Nutella y fresas!... Bueno, basta con los dulces, creo que entendieron lo que estoy tratando de decir. De todos modos, también podría haber sido al contrario, Repeat el pancake y la versión 2013 las chispas, se podría verse una, independientemente si viste la otra, y funcionar perfectamente, pero mezclarlas es mucho mejor, y fue ese el &quot;salto de calidad&quot; que me permitió apreciar más este anime, los pasados 12 episodios no me fueron suficientes para dar un 10/10, ahora sí, y estoy de verdad contento de eso.<br />
<br />
Cuando dije qué nada extraordinario sucedía y qué este anime es sobre 4 niñas creciendo en el campo, lo tienes que imaginar así de simple, nada más, nada menos, la simplicidad es la última forma de sofisticación después de todo, pero esa no es la única característica de esta serie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Simplicidad en el carácter, los modales, el estilo; en todas las cosas, la suprema excelencia es la sencillez.&quot;<br />
<br />
Una cosa qué me sorprendió, y es la característica que más aprecie en esta serie, la qué considero la &quot;chispa de calidad&quot;, fue la forma en la que se representó la figura de los niños. Nuestras chicas actúan, piensan y reaccionan como lo haría un niño común y corriente, eso lo encontré algo genial porque desde que veo anime es la primera vez que encuentro el modo perfecto de capturar el simple, inocente y natural comportamiento de uno, logrando también desarrollar una comedia hecha de forma espontáneamente por ellos, fue de verdad algo para aplaudir en pie. En mi ojos, los niños que he visto en otros anime presentan una caracterización tan falsa y antinatural, que de verdad no puedo soportar ¿no te ha sucedido esto también?<br />
<br />
No es posible bañarse dos veces en el mismo río, el aforismo &#039;panta rei&#039;, qué está a significar &#039;todo fluye&#039;, nada es invariable, pega perfectamente con lo que estoy a punto de decir. Aunque, sí, el &quot;desarrollo de personajes&quot; no es algo que brille mucho en esta serie, estoy dispuesto a afirmar que los personajes cambiaron un poco desde la ultima vez que los encontramos. Ahora que nos fue concedido más tiempo para pasar con ellos, pequeños detalles que antes desconocíamos vinieron a flote. Ninguna preocupación gente, los detalles son mínimos, nuestras chicas carismáticas siguen igual de siempre. Ichijou Hotaru, 5to grado, la chica madura de ciudad, exteriormente presenta una madurez innatural a su edad, qué pero esconde un lado infantil que nadie quiere creer; Koshigaya Natsume, 7mo grado, una chica de carácter alegre y de comportamiento algo varonil que no falla la buenas ocasiones para joder cariñosamente a sus amigas; después tenemos a Komori, 8vo grado, hermana mayor de Natsume, las más infantil del grupo aún siendo la mayor en edad, siempre trata de actuar con una madurez que no le pertenece, dando resultados penosos; Y por último tenemos a Miyauchi Renge, 1er grado, la más pequeña del grupo, pero con una fantasía y un carácter que no dejan de sorprender a sus amigas y familiares, la pequeña estrella del anime.<br />
<br />
¿Me creerías si te dijera que podríamos considerar el pueblo de Asahigaoka como parte del cast también? Los eventos se desarrollan allí, pero no es puramente un plano trasfondo, la atmósfera y sus localidades son parte de los puntos fuertes de esta serie, algo que te engancha y te captura de una manera tremenda. Primavera, Verano, Otoño e Invierno, a lo largo que se desarrollan los eventos, somos espectadores del maravilloso paisaje que este pueblo rural ofrece en las diferentes estaciones del año, mientras acompañado por las OST de tonos suaves y armónicos que suenan en el fondo, aseguran un verdadero oasis de tranquilidad.<br />
<br />
Por lo que.. ¿te gustan los pancakes con chispas de chocolate, Nutella y fresas? Bueno es hora que te los vayas buscando e inicies a ver este anime sobre 4 chicas que viven en el campo donde nada de extraordinario sucede, te aseguro que es una combinación espectacular, en más, es pura Felicidad.

    When you go about your daily life, what do you normally do?  My guess is, you either go to school, work a full shift at your work, or freelance your own kind of work in order to support yourself.  Either way, we&#039;re always busy doing something and not completely focused on just not doing anything.  So, what if we were to peer into a world where all we could do is relax and not think about what comes in the future, but focus of the here and now?  With its second season, we have Non Non Biyori Repeat.  (Technically this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199196">
        is marked as a side story, but I am still calling this the second season because its synonyms have be considered as a second season.)<br />
<br />
Story: If you haven&#039;t see Non Non Biyori before (which would be a mistake reading this review cause this is of its second season), basically, the story of this little slice of life revolves around the four main girls, Hotaru, Komari, Natsumi, and Renge, as they go day by day in the Japanese countryside playing around and nonchalantly having fun the way kids back in the day used to do, by going outside.  <br />
<br />
With its premise being the exact same as its predecessor, Repeat changes up the formula for the entire series slightly but still keeps everything very much the same.  The only difference to come from this season and the original Non Non Biyori is the fact that the in Repeat, the show puts a little more emphasis on each character.  For a good majority of its episodes, Repeat focuses particularly on one of the four major members of its cast.  One episode may be devoted to Renge and her mini accomplishments in life, while another may focus of Natsumi and her status as a tomboy, or so on and so forth.  As a result, you get to see into each particular girl&#039;s life a little bit more contrary to before where you just saw two or more of them in every scene and they just sort of meshed together.  <br />
<br />
In the end though, Repeat is still the exact same story.  Chronologically, it meshes with the original season, weaving the whole story together since the entirety of both seasons takes random points in time over the course of an entire year in order to present it as a show.  As a base idea, Non Non Biyori itself is the same as a horde other of other slice of life shows involving girls, with its main gimmick being that it involves itself in the countryside.  <br />
<br />
But even though Repeat is in a sense, a rehash of Non Non Biyori again (because it literally is the same show with different scenes), there wasn&#039;t anything particularly bad about it.  It has a certain unique charm to it and plays to its strengths with its characters and setting.  And it also just gently comes to a close like a falling petal; it was a quaint little end.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ More Non Non Biyori (because that was a good show)<br />
+ Made some character focused episodes<br />
+ Good ending<br />
-  Kind of an overused idea (Think about how many anime there are about a group of girls)<br />
<br />
Characters: Characters in Repeat are literally the same cast as who you see in Non Non Biyori.  We still have the main four character, we still have Candy Store and all of the various sisters of Renge, and we still have Natsumi and Komari&#039;s mute Nii-san.  This cast doesn&#039;t change at all in the grand scheme of things.  They&#039;re all still the exact same character and there isn&#039;t much character development, if at all, for the entire series.  <br />
<br />
However, what I did find interesting about the characters was the fact that while you don&#039;t get to see any true development with how they are as a person, you get to sort of get a glimpse on how they came to be.  Several episodes contain some &quot;backstories&quot;, and showcase the progression of how something came to be like Renge&#039;s recorder, what life was like years ago when Renge was just a baby, and the true story on how the Koma-chan dolls came to be.  It showed how several things and relationships in the series came to be, and I found that to be which created a nice touch on the series.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Good ol&#039; same Non Non Biyori cast<br />
+ Backstory elements to see how things came to be<br />
-  No true character development<br />
-  Nii-san still does not say a goddamn word in this series (Personal Complaint)<br />
<br />
Art: Created by Silver Link once again, Non Non Biyori Repeat comes back to us with its ever bright and colorful world of the countryside.  Filled with detailed backgrounds, pretty, bright colors, and above all, quite a lot of interesting countryside stuff to do.  Like its first season, Repeat doesn&#039;t stray from what the animation wanted to do.  While the art is very nice looking, it doesn&#039;t take away from the show wants you to see and adds an aesthetic to the series rather than being the complete focus on what they want you to see.  <br />
<br />
As this is a comedy series, Repeat also utilizes a lot of exaggerated expressions and overdramatic scenes in order to capitalize on the current moment at hand.  However, contrary to a lot of comedy series that utilize this, Repeat doesn&#039;t completely capitalize on it and mostly stays the same with its normal animation even when it goes to that extreme.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Nice, simple artwork<br />
+ Consistent quality<br />
+  No overuse of overdramatic tropes.  <br />
<br />
Sound: Like a lot of Slice of Life anime, the songs that are used for the series aren&#039;t really all that memorable.  Because they use the soundtrack to compliment the tone of the series, the songs usually are quite lackluster in terms of a wow factor or memorability factor.  As such, Non Non Biyori Repeat follows this similar trend by having two, while nice and calming songs for its OP and ED, aren&#039;t particularly noteworthy.  They sound nice and fit well with the tone of the show on account of its lightheartedness and nonchalant sound with recorders, light instruments, and overall upbeat tone, but there isn&#039;t anything about it that&#039;s going to particularly stick in your head like glue.  <br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment: Non Non Biyori Repeat was well, exactly the same show as Non Non Biyori except you replace the entire series with completely new scenes.  There isn&#039;t any progression in the series as everything still follows the exact same year of school, and there wasn&#039;t really anything outstanding about how the series presented itself, but that&#039;s the charm in this whole thing.  It was meant to be simple, it was meant to be calm, and I loved it for those reasons.  <br />
<br />
Did I enjoy this series?<br />
<br />
Yes, I did.  While it&#039;s not the most complicated thing that I&#039;ve ever watched, its simplicity was a virtue.  Every little character interaction, every antic Natsumi or Renge got into was fun in its own right.  I come out of this season with several new favorite scenes and there really wasn&#039;t anything I didn&#039;t like about this series.<br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I like about this series?<br />
<br />
Nothing, I&#039;ll be honest.  While there are a couple technical issues for the show seeing as it was actually a rehash of the same show, there wasn&#039;t anything that I would outright dislike about Repeat.  It was fun to watch and it was peaceful and enjoyable; I have no complaints, period.  <br />
<br />
Would I recommend this anime?<br />
<br />
If you want a relaxing series that isn&#039;t all that thought-provoking, Non Non Biyori is the series for you.  (Although, if you want to watch Repeat, I would at least say watch the first episode of the original Non Non Biyori first since that is the sort of background for the entire show.)  It&#039;s a very relaxing show that doesn&#039;t have too much beyond its simple &quot;kids playing in the countryside&quot; story but it doesn&#039;t need it.  Sure, it&#039;s like a whole lot of other shows but I still think if you&#039;re curious about it, give it a chance to cleanse you of any troubles you may have.

    If I am allowed to give a medal, I will give it to this anime who&#039;d never betrayed me. Probably we can also said, this is the one of the works that is hard for majority people to be hate. As if judging a magnificent work of art, as much as the high appraisal i&#039;m going carefully to put into it.<br />
<br />
Serenity and convenience felt in thicknesess like when I had to listen whole songs out of there with relaxing atmosphere. Surely this manage to set me free from tension of bustle and hustle of my real life.<br />
(This is my total impression addressing to this anime).<br />
<br />
Non

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369022">
        Non Biyori, is not an anime series who became extraordinary caused by influential of it&#039;s main ideas but it came from the accuracy in plot structure development. Shows the audience harmonious of plot composition, art style, background music, in a manner of neatness and appropriate. Focus point is not the core thing that displayed in this series as far. Authenticity of SoL that wrapped in adorable, hillarious, and pleasant moment is the way how this anime presented to the audience, as well as were we taken to follow the adventures of daily activities characters who role in it. Incredible, even if just by following those simple path Non Non Biyori has proven that it&#039;s worthly than anything. None of boredom thing I found here, everything flows in a pure way even though it only shows their daily in each episode. Indeed, that&#039;s the real expectation i want to experienced through this show. No need to be more or less. This is something simple that is great in the true sense of the word.<br />
<br />
Talk about the characters, I assume that all of the characters in this anime are the main characters. Neither of them highlighted in excessively, or in any more less way. In addition, they all have their own signature and introduced to the audience emotionally in moderation with correct portions.<br />
<br />
Artstyle, here is probably the most uplifilled reason of all it, without an extraordinary art background the result may not become as well as now. Landscape potrait, the angles of highlights at certain moments, expressly supporting the story into dramatic levels. The natural emotions of village&#039;s circumstance are depicted in a quite complex way, thanks to the artistic style. There is nothing looks stuffy here, the entire character movement looks fluid and natural. As I mentioned in previous section, conformity of plot composition, art style and soundtrack background made it works properly.<br />
<br />
Conclusion, this anime is not just about how curious you adhering to the sequel, more than that Non Non Biyori comes to you as an addictive. Ignoring the deals about you might like it or not, it&#039;s about how this anime make you attached to need it.

    I was waiting the whole entire series just to hear Suguru&#039;s voice ): &quot;he doesn&#039;t speak much and has very little presence&quot; no shit sir, he doesn&#039;t speak at all! Damn it!<br />
<br />
Jokes aside, I loved to see this reprise of the series, which is one of my favorite slice of life of all times. The characters are still lovely and cuddly as ever! You just feel like you&#039;ve reached nirvana while you watch this anime. I seriously would love to move to a small city being again just a child with a simple and fun life as theirs.<br />
<br />
Some minimal details that I&#039;ve missed in this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199154">
        new season are the funny quotes like the first season and a faster pace. Not that calm stories are not as amazing as the fast ones, especially because the pace of Non Non was always quieter and lighter.<br />
<br />
I spent a nice time watching it and I still love it as much as I had on the previous season. And I think that is actually amazing that I&#039;m not drowning in tears for finishing watching it, like I was when I finished to watch Tamako Market or Shirokuma Cafe. But I am also happy that it had not left a hole in my chest, lol.<br />
<br />
Non Non Biyori Repeat is one more way to spend some nice time to relax and I want to recommend it to everyone I know that likes this type of anime, because is worth it. And I&#039;m gonna miss these times so much!

    And a end to another good slice of life anime series...<br />
I will miss this one<br />
<br />
Short Summary:<br />
At Asahioka Branch School (in the countryside), there are only five students there; none of them in the the same grade. The story follows the daily lives of the four girls of the school; playing in rivers, having secret bases and many more.<br />
The pace is easygoing but it&#039;s enjoyable and heartwarming.<br />
<br />
This anime is a sequel to the first season &quot;Non Non Biyori&quot; and like the first season, this season was enjoyable!<br />
<br />
There is no specific story (as this is a slice of life) yet it is fun to watch.<br />
I was actually

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200873">
        surprised when I heard that this series was getting a second season (I mean there&#039;s no solid plot) but I was glad to see it again.<br />
<br />
If you enjoy slice of life series or enjoyed the first season of the anime then watch it! <br />
You can even start from this season and go back to the first season! It&#039;s the heartwarming comedy that drags you into this anime

    (This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)<br />
<br />
Non Non Biyori Repeat almost makes me feel bad about myself.<br />
<br />
To Renge and the gang, a cell phone is a sign of luxury, and “dot com” is a mysterious concept. To me, I cannot live without the Internet. I cannot go a day without using a computer or checking out /r/anime or playing a video game. I do not consider smartphones and e-mail anomalies; I consider them necessities.<br />
<br />
But Repeat does not make me feel bad for too long, for quickly afterwards it provides a superb experience with a lot of heart and a lot of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review215600">
        soul, forcing me to realize that life’s most important parts are the ones that have been nearby all along.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Repeat is a slice-of-life anime. Its contents are everyday events, singular nuggets of fun. And if that is all one wants to take away from the show, that is perfectly fine. But if one were to look past the simplicity in search of more powerful themes, they are there.<br />
<br />
The best way to understand Repeat’s message is to view it through a small scope and a big scope. The former inspects individual instances whereas the latter takes a step back to look at the anime’s narrative as a whole. With the small scope, there are two specific scenes that reveal the nature of the show, and with the big scope, an entire season is required.<br />
<br />
The first scene using the smaller scope happens rather early in the season. Hotaru, Natsumi, and Komari, as well as Renge and Suguru, are in school. After being granted a break by their teacher, the five of them choose to have some fun by playing a game. The game they choose to play is called “knock-down-the-ruler.”<br />
<br />
What proceeds is an intense game filled with daring actions and legendary outcomes…with nothing but a few rulers and some pencils. These rulers and pencils lead into Repeat’s first theme: The simple things in life are the most beautiful. Neither expensive objects nor new-age technologies are needed to make life wonderful. All that is needed are a few pieces of plastic on a table, a stick in hand, and one’s endless font of imagination. The second scene using the small scope happens in the final episode of the season. The group is waiting at Nasumi and Komari’s house when a neighbor comes to visit. Their mother greets the woman, and the group goes to the side of the house to sit in the sun and wait.<br />
<br />
For roughly four straight minutes, the same spot is shown. This time passes rather uneventfully. The girls play a game of slaps. Natsumi recounts a dream she had but nobody listens. A butterfly floats by that Natsumi and Renge chase after. Komari and Hotaru get up to grab some tea and juice. The mother from before is heard talking with the neighbor at the front door. Suguru walks in, finds nobody around, and leaves. All the while, the anime never moves away from the scene.<br />
<br />
Despite resting on a single snapshot, so much is happening in one moment. Hence, the second theme is made known: Life is constantly moving. There is always something happening or something to be had. It may be chasing a butterfly, going to get juice, or simply walking away. Regardless, life continues to move.<br />
<br />
Looking at Repeat using the big scope encapsulates the bigger idea of the anime. The structure of the show closely follows the first season, and some events even overlap with the first season. (Sometimes, clips or scenes from the first season are reused.) Obviously what is depicted is not exactly the same, but what the characters go through within the “narrative” is similar: hanging out, trying out new ventures, and experiencing what life has to offer.<br />
<br />
This gets at the most important theme of the show: Life is a series of repetitive tasks. That sounds like a negative, but it is not. Just because what people do on a daily basis is repetitive does not devalue what life is. Instead, it demonstrates what is most important: friends and family chief among them.<br />
<br />
Repeat shows this constantly. Eating a meal with others on a rainy day. Having a conversation with a friend. Working together to accomplish a goal. These activities are had all of the time by everyone, but what makes them unique, what makes them special, are who these activities are spent with.<br />
<br />
With Repeat, it combines this theme with the others, capturing a wonderful idea. That despite how simple life may be, despite how continual life may be, and despite how repetitive life may be, life is a remarkable opportunity. An opportunity that should not just be enjoyed individually but also shared with the people held close.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
<br />
One of the ways in which Repeat turns its anime into a relaxing one is through its artistic direction. The most obvious is the art itself. Simply put, it is stunning. Pastoral landscapes filled with greens, yellows, and blues. A single, lazy car rolling down a dirt road. Dazzling stars against a nighttime sky or a purplish-red sunset cascading over the nearby grass. Repeat, like its predecessor, emphasizes its environment to achieve its relaxed mood.<br />
<br />
Less obvious is Repeat’s subtle yet constant technique of lingering. Almost every anime (indeed, almost every visual medium) has quick shots like those landscapes or that sky that are used to establish setting. Repeat, however, is slightly different. Rather than just quickly showing these scenes, the anime lingers on them usually a second longer than the audience believes it will. Doing so engrosses the audience in the country environment, letting them feel the nostalgia and comfortability more so than usual.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, such intense focus on the art produces an obvious decline in the actual animation. Hotaru and the others obviously move, but it is rare for them to move in a nuanced manner. Luckily, the character designs help to make up for this lack of animation. While none of the characters are exotic in their designs, they each have a normalcy to them that coincides with the everyday feeling of the show.<br />
<br />
For example, Hotaru’s mature looks contrast with the childish nature of Natsumi, Komari, and Renge, making her stand out but not overly so. Renge’s twin tails with yellow ribbons and triangular mouth paint her as the cute kid that she is. And Natsumi’s tomboyish attitude is portrayed by her messy hair and simple clothing. Furthermore, each of the characters goes through multiple outfits throughout the season, inducing variety and demonstrating attention to details.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
The characters of Repeat are by no means complex. The same can be said for many slice-of-life anime. However, what the cast lacks in complexity they make up for in purpose. Not just one of them but all of them.<br />
<br />
The prime example – arguably the strongest part of Repeat – that lets the audience understand the characters’ message happens later on in the season. (Those that have completed the season can probably correctly guess which scene is about to be analyzed.) Renge decides that it is time for her to no longer use her training wheels on her bicycle. She determines that she can learn how to properly ride her bike, enlisting “Candy Store” to help her out.<br />
<br />
Most people would say that the quintessential moment from this scene is when Candy Store pushes Renge on her bike one last time, and Renge neither falls nor (and most importantly) does not come back. There is definitely merit to thinking this way. This moment not only symbolizes Renge conquering the conflict she was combating but also symbolizes growing up. There comes a point in nearly everyone’s life where people mature and change and move on. Candy Store saw remnants of this first hand earlier on in the episode when the other characters were already doting on Renge and when she was the one getting doted on by Renge.<br />
<br />
But that final push is not the quintessential moment. That moment comes shortly after. Renge and the group arrive at Candy Store’s candy store. They decide to pick up some candy, and, as is shown (it is subtle, happening in just a few seconds) Renge has trouble getting the candy that she wants. The person who helps her is not Hotaru, not Natsumi, and not Komari. The person who helps her is Candy Store.<br />
<br />
It is this moment that highlights the theme of Repeat’s characters: Growing up does not mean goodbye. People grow and develop not by their lonesome. They grow and develop with the support of the people around them. And just because people grow and develop does not mean that those supporters automatically get tossed away. It just means that they cannot help them now. But they will always be there, cheering on their successes, consoling them in their failures, and caring for them in their decisions.<br />
<br />
The other main characters also portray this theme through their own, personalized events. Komari finds a plush doll, now battered and disheveled, that she used to covet as a child. She no longer carries it with her, but she treats her little supporter with the respect it deserves for helping her those many years ago when she has it cleaned and fixed up.<br />
<br />
Hotaru has a fear of jumping into the river from the stone bridge. Yet after receiving a lovely letter from her friends back in Tokyo, she musters the courage to take that leap to show her friends that she, too, is growing as a person. (Of course, this does not stop her from acting like a kid at home.)<br />
<br />
Natsumi is the only main character that does not have a personalized moment of this type. Her main role is to be the goofball girl who makes sure that the atmosphere remains lighthearted. This can be viewed either negatively or positively.<br />
<br />
In the negative sense, since Renge, Komari, and Hotaru receive such growth, Natsumi should grow, too. She is not some side character that is barely involved; she is a part of nearly every event. In the positive sense, her character is someone who believes that one should “play while you have the chance.” Meaning, while she may not grow up like the rest, she represents someone who is not looking to grow up anytime soon. In the meantime, she is there riding her bike with Renge, receiving advice from Komari, and waiting in the river for Hotaru.<br />
<br />
In other words, Natsumi’s character contrasts with the others, highlighting Renge’s, Komari’s, and Hotaru’s own growth while she herself is that constant supporter. Such growth will no doubt occur for her at some point, but, for now, she is more than content with who she is and where she happens to be going. And when she does decide to grow as a person, she will have her loved ones to lean on.<br />
<br />
Loved ones that, no matter what happens, will always be there for her.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
The opening track for Repeat is fantastic. The accent of the vocalist works extremely well with the country vibe. The banjo follows the same feel. And the beat is entirely uplifting. But best of all, the last part of the track – where the main gang are triumphantly marching – is catchy and simple and fun. This OP perfectly captures what this series is all about, making it a pleasure to listen to both in and out of the show.<br />
<br />
While the ending track is easily weaker than the opening track, that does not mean the ED is without strength of its own. The varying vocalists gets at the theme of sharing life with those closest. Happiness is exuded by the singing and the instruments, fitting the mood of the anime. And the beginning and ending sections – with the recorder and the xylophone, respectively – create a nice lead-in and lead-out. Altogether, this track is, like the OP, a wonderful fit for the show.<br />
<br />
The rest of the original soundtrack continues the high level of execution that the OP and the ED previously demonstrated. The flutes, the violins, the ukuleles, the xylophones, and the harmonicas come together to form pleasant, lazy tracks that create the perfect atmosphere for the show. Silly, emotional, and ominous tracks accompany the main arrangements, being used for specific scenes throughout the season like when Candy Store rushes to Renge’s house to check up on her and when Komari is afraid of the real-life teru-teru bouzu. Overall, the OST is a powerhouse that does exactly what it needs to do and more.<br />
<br />
And it perhaps goes without saying that the voice acting performances within Repeat are well above average. Kotori Koiwai as Renge uses a unique, energetic voice that captures the curious young girl amazingly. Rie Murakawa as Hotaru gives the fifth grader a mature yet childish voice that fits the equally mature and childish girl. And Kana Asumi as Komari always nails the screaming scenes in which she is scared. (This happens more often than one may think.)<br />
<br />
Also, a strange and special shout-out to the producers of the anime for refraining from going the easy-joke route by giving Suguru, Komari and Natsumi’s older brother, a voice. (In a hopefully third season, finally having him speak would be more than fine since so much build-up to what his first words would be has already been fostered.)<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
As I did with the “Story” and “Characters” section, I will use an example that encapsulates the anime: its adorableness, its comedy, and its heart.<br />
<br />
Episode six is entitled “We Made Friends with Fireflies,” and that is the subject of this example. The group comes together during the day to work on homework over their break from school. While working, Hotaru suggests that they come over to her house at night to light some fireworks her parents will be purchasing. The country bumpkins are extremely excited for something they rarely get to see, Hotaru is happy they are coming over, and the plan is set.<br />
<br />
First is the adorable moment. When Renge, Komari, and the others arrive, Hotaru opens her door. But she is no longer smiling like before. Instead, she is wailing, crying her eyes out because her parents were unable to procure the fireworks. Hotaru’s voice, her mannerisms, and her reaction are so genuine that I wanted to just hug her and tell her everything was going to be all right.<br />
<br />
Second is the comedic moment. Hotaru has only one firework to light, but, as it turns out, the “firework” is nothing more than a device that shot a parachute-using toy into the air. The group tries (read: fails) to hide their disappointment by cheering up Hotaru. But Renge’s response is the best: she starts to console Hotaru, slowly becomes unable to do so, and then falls on her knees while saying, “You didn’t do anything wrong, Hotarun.” I found the whole debacle hilarious.<br />
<br />
Third is the heartfelt moment. Kazuho leads them all to a secluded spot in the woods where fireflies (“Hotaruns”) are gently floating by. The music, Hotaru’s reaction to getting a firefly to land on her piece of grass, and the ambience of the whole scene creates a sublime, serene experience that is nothing short of powerful.<br />
<br />
Not all of the scenes in the anime had the same power as this firefly scene, but they all had some combination of those three aforementioned traits. Renge as a baby biting Candy Store’s shirt to show deep affection was beyond adorable. Hotaru and Komari scared out of their minds when their flashlight broke was hilarious. And Natsumi getting Flatty-san’s children into the aquarium in order to cheer up Renge was wonderful. The whole anime was not a show that I merely watched; the anime was a phenomenal experience.<br />
<br />
Non Non Biyori Repeat is cute, funny, and touching. But the anime is more than just these superficial traits. The anime champions simplicity and explores maturity, delivering an endearing tale that can make anyone – even a person addicted to the Internet – understand that life and the people it is shared with are beautiful.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Great, a slice-of-life adventure that truly embodies the spirit of life<br />
<br />

<br />
Characters: Great, Renge, Komari, Hotaru, and Natsumi teach that growing up does not mean goodbye<br />
<br />
Sound: Great, awesome OP, good ED, very nice OST, above average VA performances<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Great, an emotional and worthwhile experience<br />
<br />
Final Score: 9/10

    Non Non Biyori Repeat isn&#039;t a direct sequel to Non Non Biyori. As the subtitle &quot;Repeat&quot; may suggest, it begins where the original Non Non Biyori also begins, and ends where Non Non Biyori ended. Think of it more as a &quot;deleted scenes&quot; type deal, where the entirety of the second season takes place in between the events of the first season.<br />
<br />
Story - 9/10<br />
Who knew an anime about the average lives of average people living in the Japanese country-side could be so freaking great? Non Non Biyori (I&#039;m just going to call it that since it&#039;s essentially the exact same anime as the first season)

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199163">
        has an all but nonexistent plot, which at first may seem like it&#039;s not a good thing at all. But when you begin to get into Non Non Biyori you realize that having no plot is exactly what makes the anime so charming. You don&#039;t need to worry about character drama, or development, or story progression, or anything else that you&#039;d likely look for in almost any other story. You can just sit back, relax, and enjoy the antics of the characters as they simply live their lives. It certainly may not captivate everyone, especially those that mainly enjoy fast-paced, exciting stories. But for what it sets out to do, it accomplishes it with near perfection.<br />
<br />
Art - 9/10<br />
The art in Non Non Biyori might not seem like anything spectacular at a first glance. But again, for what it sets out to do, it&#039;s simply stellar. The character designs are nice and simple without feeling lazy. They aren&#039;t flashy or spectacularly stunning or diverse, so they don&#039;t distract you from the main focus of the show. They, simply put, just look like normal, average people. On the other hand, the backgrounds are beautifully detailed without being hyper-realistic, and again, not distracting from the show itself. You can really put yourself at home in the setting of the quiet country village.<br />
<br />
Sound - 8/10<br />
The sound in Non Non Biyori works as the glue that holds everything together. The music is simple, quiet, and lighthearted. The voice-acting and dialogue is sincere and realistic. Oftentimes you&#039;ll experience long periods of silence and stillness, accentuating the quiet, everyday life nature of the show. It happened to me a few times that I had to check to see if the video had paused!<br />
<br />
Character - 10/10<br />
You&#039;d be hard-pressed to find anything in a single in one of the characters that even closely resembles a flaw. I&#039;ll admit, at first I was disappointed that Natsumi and Komari&#039;s older brother didn&#039;t have a single line of dialogue in the entire series. That is, until I discovered that it worked PERFECTLY into his character and made him one of the funniest characters in Non Non Biyori, second only to Renge in my eyes. But I digress. The characters and their interactions with each other make the show an absolute bliss to watch. If there&#039;s one thing other than fluffy happiness that you&#039;ll feel while watching Non Non Biyori, it&#039;ll be a sentimental nostalgia like you&#039;ve never had. It will make you remember back to when internet and gadgets were the least of our worries, and we&#039;d just waste the hours away with our childhood friends, many of whom we&#039;ve long since lost contact with. It made me sad watching the last episode today, realizing that if this were real life, the close-knit relationship that these characters have would eventually turn to dust in the wind...<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 9/10<br />
At the end of the day, I enjoyed Non Non Biyori through and through. My only complaint is that I wish it were longer as of right now. I deeply hope that a 3rd season will be made. Until then, I&#039;d better check out the manga!<br />
<br />
Overall - 9/10<br />
Non Non Biyori is probably the best pure Slice of Life anime I&#039;ve seen. I would not hesitate to recommend this to any fan of the SoL genre, or anyone who is considering getting into it.<br />
<br />
Nyanpasu!

    Non Non Biyori Repeat returns once more to Renge, Hotaru, Natsumi, and Komari, and their everyday lives in the country side. After watching through all 12 episodes, I can confidently say that this season of Non Non Biyori fully lives up to, and perhaps even surpasses, the quality of its first season. I personally think Non Non Biyori is one of few slice-of-life anime that truly exemplifies the best aspects of the genre. To me, many slice-of-life anime are rather paradoxical, in that the &quot;everyday life&quot; happenings that they are supposed to portray are pushed towards unrealistic for comedic or emotional effect. This makes the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199283">
        show memorable, but it&#039;s not what Non Non Biyori relies on. Amid the exaggerated &quot;everyday&quot; occurrences, Non Non Biyori still manages to masterfully convey the beauty and joy of the simple and the mundane.<br />
<br />
One of the main ways this is achieved is through its use of art and sound. The animation is simply stellar. It can best be seen in the many natural scenes in the show. From the leaves on the trees to the sparkles in the river, to the cloud covered skies, everything is finely detailed. The beauty of the nature reinforces the idea of beauty in the normal and commonplace. This is coupled with the skilled use of the soundtrack. Though overall its music is amazing, one of the best examples I think is Renge&#039;s recorder. Even carrying the melody, instead of having the notes played perfectly, all the missed notes and all the squeaks are left in. Background music doesn&#039;t exist in the real world, but the imperfections in the playing are transformed into the beautiful sound of the real and everyday life while still achieving its end as the musical component in any show.<br />
<br />
Non Non Biyori also contains its share of great characters. Hotaru&#039;s adorable personality, the childish eccentricity of Renge, and the many antics of Natsumi all make a continuously entertaining, occasionally heart-moving, and all around enjoyable show. This season seems to be focusing slightly more on Renge and her development as a young child, but the other characters still get plenty of their share of screen time.<br />
<br />
As far as the story goes, it&#039;s plotless and episodic as is the majority of the genre. This season however seems to touch on more mature themes, and it does so in the most bright and heart-warmingly optimistic way. In one episode, we see Renge&#039;s heavy depression at the death of her pet shrimps, but Natsumi cheers her up by showing her the shrimps&#039; newborn infants. The episode touches on the theme of mortality, but rather than leaving it at that, the show provides a soothing answer, pointing towards the often-neglected, opposite spectrum of the cycle of life, the birth of new life. In another episode, we see many flashbacks of the early lives of our characters. Komari especially looks through an old photo album with many childhood photos. All this touches on the theme of the passage of time, and although many artists portray the passage of time as that which fades beauty and topples empires, etc. etc., in Komari fixing her old teddy bear and telling Natsumi to take care of the Super Ball which Natsumi used to play with, Non Non Biyori displays the passage of time as something to be treasured and held dear. It paints the past as something to be taken care of, else you&#039;ll &quot;regret it later&quot;.<br />
<br />
Finally, my favorite part of the show is how beautifully it speaks to the joy in the simple things in life. Playing &quot;drop the ruler&quot; during break at school, catching fireflies at night, jumping into a river from a bridge, all touch me deeply. In the last episode, there is an unmoving shot of the kids just waiting around that lasts for several minutes. These moments of inaction, of passivity, and just how relaxed and calm it makes you feel is where the show does its best. The show is full of these gratuitous scenes, in which the mundane and commonplace shine in its calm, peaceful, and gentle beauty. These kids in the countryside playing around and enjoying themselves in every which way - there&#039;s a certain universality to it. Beyond the innocent optimism of youth, Non Non Biyori portrays the loveliness of simple and everyday things. This is why I would strongly recommend this anime to anyone looking for something easy-going, yet equally compelling.

    Non Non Biyori is a true master of the slice of life genre. It doesn&#039;t follow the typical cliche things girls do in their free time in the city but instead accounts for what to do when the city isn&#039;t an option. The result of Non Non Biyori is a mixture of heartwarming, happiness, and nostalgia for your childhood. Non Non Biyori Repeat improves upon that even more and created one of the happiest times I&#039;ve ever experienced watching anime.<br />
<br />
Story: (9/10)<br />
The story is pretty basic. It&#039;s the exact same as Non Non Biyori but takes place at different points in time between the first season

          <span style="display: none;" id="review212867">
        and shows them. Renge seems to have a much bigger presence in this season and I enjoyed her stories a lot as Renge is one of my favorite characters. What really makes the story amazing is all of the experiences these girls have. They all revolve around nature, small towns, and childhood.<br />
<br />
Art: (10/10)<br />
The backgrounds used in this anime are really where Non Non Biyori excels. They&#039;re absolutely stunning and create a beautiful world of nature to enjoy. The animation is a huge part of what makes this anime so enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Sound: (8/10)<br />
The sound is great as always. When the moments are right the music is always there to make the moment even more heartwarming and beautiful.<br />
<br />
Character: (9/10)<br />
The characters are the same as before. As stated, Renge is a lot more present in this season her stories really have the biggest point of nostalgia.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: (10/10)<br />
Here&#039;s where this anime stands out. The enjoyment is very different from any other series I&#039;ve experienced. For me, watching Non Non Biyori Repeat gave me an overwhelming sense of happiness and nostalgia, so much that I even cried a few times. I feel to truly enjoy this anime you had to have had a bit of experience with nature as a kid. The nostalgia that oozes out of this anime is based on reliving a bit of the childhood you did have, and the childhood you wanted to have.<br />
<br />
So if you want to relive your early life with nature and you enjoyed Non Non Biyori even a little, make sure to tackle Repeat. It&#039;s a great continuation that has by far truly been the best slice of life I&#039;ve seen yet.

    Non Non Biyori Repeat has possibly become my favorite Slice of Life anime. This is the second season and hopefully not the last. The ambiance was what won me over. Just Beautiful, relaxing and calm life style that just brought me back to when I lived in the country side except I didn&#039;t have any friends with me (and still don&#039;t...). Anyways lets get started!<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
<br />
This was the weakest point in the anime in my opinion. But almost every slice of life has this issue of not having a major plot. I don&#039;t condemn it for not having a plot what so ever.<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
<br />
Huge improvement

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199604">
        from the first season. Lots of focus on the landscape, the trees and water. It captures the essence of living there. It really reinforces the fact that even though they don&#039;t have a lot of technology they have a wide variety of place to go and explore and play. It seems as if they put more time and effort into this. The characters clothing change almost every episode and huge difference from the first season.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
<br />
Calm and relaxing music to play along. The ambient sounds such as the wind blowing and water flowing adds to what seems like a the most peaceful scenarios.<br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
<br />
Would have liked to see more Koma-chan and her not being so &quot;I want to be a adult&quot; like attitude. But overall I noticed little changes from the first season. Renge was a lot cuter acting, Hotaru being Hotaru, Natsumi got so much more screen time. Secondary character where given more backstory which was awesome.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
<br />
The anime defiantly had an idea to make me feel what the characters where feeling. When Renge was saying all her stuff It felt funny and cute, when the landscapes where being presented It felt as if you can close your eyes and actually be there. Just a mixer of feelings.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
<br />
In conclusion, the anime was great and had a nice, pure touch to it. zero fanservice, no romance and just kids being kids. A great change of pace for all the anime that is out there right now. Defiantly want more of this anime and can&#039;t wait for it. A huge recommendation to watch first season as well.<br />
<br />
Thank you all who took their time to read this and have a nice day:) <br />
<br />

    For a slice of life this show was absolutely beautiful. I have not really seen this concept in a show were it mainly takes place in a low populated and low interest place. This show pulls off the concept well, as the main characters goof off and just have fun to make for each episode being different and some how enjoyable. The comedy is smart at times, making for a simple joke to actually be a laugh out loud moment. The characters are simple and yet they are entertaining, never losing character all throughout the show. Each episode is different, and nothing major happens that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201715">
        could change any episode. This show did a swell job at making a simple concept very entertaining.

    I think, this anime is the best healing anime ever ! That just my opinion, but if you watch it, i promise it never dissapoint you.<br />
<br />
This anime was full of girls, with 4 main protagonist (Renge, Natsumi, Hotaru, and Komari). Just one male character appeared in this season (Komari and Natsumi&#039;s older brother). They&#039;re alive in the village and enjoy every moment. They&#039;re playing together, have fun together, and gave audience positive aura. <br />
<br />
I like everything in this anime. Lovable character, Natural dialogue, Good Comedy, Village theme, and The Story was so simple to watch. Soundtrack was great, fit with this anime.<br />
<br />
If you want to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review228946">
        watch anime with family, this anime is the best choice.

Nyanpasu! Are you ready to repeat the whole experience of relaxation in the countryside once more? I hope you are! Repeat is another seed planted on an already wonderful garden. And it&#039;s a sequel that has flourished into a daisy symbolizing the purity and innocence shared by Non Non Biyori.<br />
<br />
Asahigaoka. It may just be a small village, but it knows what purity is all about. Like an aromatic wave of petrichor after the pitter patters of rain, the lingering sweetness marks the cycle of pleasant experiences bounded by freshness and positivity. Many new adventures are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287610">
        awaiting them as the sun celebrates the time to rise and shine! For these blooming flowers, Asahigaoka is their special home. The country life is full of rejuvenating activities, and these children continue to enjoy each other&#039;s company while living in that simplistic joy. They play with the elements found in nature, from exploring the floras to gazing at the bugs. And they also interact and form new memories with one another, speaking volumes to the young and carefree nature they all have. Together alongside the nonchalant comedies, these aspects are able to produce a lighthearted spirit. It&#039;s only packed into a small circle of friendship but the expressed friendliness emits out an aura that will make anyone smile brightly. To be able to feel this much warmth, it&#039;s not everyday that you&#039;ll experience such a purified emotion. So let&#039;s cherish it. March along the path laid out by these girls. There&#039;s a soothing oasis waiting to greet us when we reach the end of the trail!<br />
<br />
Here we go! It&#039;s time to advance forward towards that refreshing sanctuary. Feel the freshness as we walk through the lush playground. With nature bringing a bountiful supply of life and love into the village, the entire place is decorated with a verdant beauty composed of hues chosen from a rainbow-colored spectrum. This palette paints a landscape with emotional attachments. And whether it takes place in the glassy daylight or the starry night-time, just embracing the pastoral setting is enough to cause many strong feelings. You can always feel the joy as you stand on Asahigaoka&#039;s ground. It&#039;s a reminder of all the harmonious and melodic qualities found in the outside world. Similar to the wafting wind that blows gently against our cheeks, the rhythmic music balances each scene together and reflects an image with soothing effects. It&#039;s no wonder why the girls of Asahigaoka can enjoy the rural environment. Their elation taking form with childlike personalities can be seen in the opening sequence, which serves as a great set up for the happy tranquility that follows on. All these genuine smiles are a bliss worth more than a thousand words. They are the treasured experiences. Not something to be forgotten through the four seasons, but something that will always live on as the days change and grow. After all, happiness is a paradise right?<br />
<br />
In this rural idyll, Repeat has blossomed into a daisy with its white petals and yellow disc floret. It represents the purity enveloping a warmth brought upon by the wonderful memories of Non Non Biyori. And together alongside other daisies, it will forever continue to spread its relaxation around.

    2nd season of Non Non Biyori and it has lived up to its predecessor.<br />
<br />
Story: N/A<br />
It&#039;s a slice of life so you can&#039;t expect epic plots and what not, so it&#039;s more or less episodic, though that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s bad, just that there really isn&#039;t much of a story to tell.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
I am thoroughly impressed by the art, especially the backdrops. The art is so detailed it&#039;s almost like looking at a photo. I have never seen backdrops that detract your attention away from the actual characters more than I have here. The hills and forests are so green, the skies are as blue as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199232">
        they are in real life, even the clouds feel alive as they drift slowly by, their edges lit brightly by the warm glowing sun. <br />
<br />
The characters themselves aren&#039;t too bad either. The quality seems consistent along with no awkward moments where their features seem out of place.<br />
<br />
Sound 9:<br />
Didn&#039;t really like the OP and ED so there&#039;s the minus 1. However, the BGM just feels really nice with the original recorder compositions that offers a nice, relaxing and soothing sensation. A very good anime for in-between epic and action-packed anime. There&#039;s also the subtle sound of rain and the rustle of leaves from the trees that add a very natural feeling to it as you watch and listen. Never have I felt as calm as I did watching these episodes, feeling as though I was out in some rural area as I did. I hope they keep up such soothing, natural, subtle sounds.<br />
<br />
Character 9:<br />
The characters each have their own quirks and reactions to things. Their reactions to everyday events is quite pleasing as it&#039;s something that most people wouldn&#039;t have been able to enjoy, given the rural scenario, but if they did, would look back and definitely feel nostalgic. Hell, being a person who spends a lot of time reading, studying, gaming, etc. I would have yearned for a year or even a few months to have a few friends to wander about with, enjoying nature. But I guess we can&#039;t all be Non Non Biyori characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10:<br />
Nothing to have to be surprised by, nothing to have to be disappointed by, nothing to be enraged by, it&#039;s like watching a childhood that you could have had and feeling a little jealous for the fictitious characters. Carefree days, while being able to enjoy the small things in life (buying drinks from a vending machine, candy from the candy shop) sometimes seems such a much more pleasant time than going to school/work everyday only to feel stressed by the expectations, then only to escape by gaming, drinking etc.<br />
<br />
Overall 10:<br />
It&#039;s a very nice change of pace from tryhard shounen stories with their cliched plots and expected &#039;plot twists&#039;. It&#039;s also a good break from action packed anime. It&#039;s something just to sink in and enjoy the natural sounds of rustling leaves, falling rain and whistling cicadas. In a way, you get to experience a different childhood through the characters and in just a small way, you feel a little envious for them.

    Why does it have to end so fast? I enjoyed NNB. :( So here is my review about NNB Repeat. <br />
<br />
After watching season 1, i find it enjoyable and fun to watch so i&#039;m expecting season 2 to be better than season one. With season 2 is over, I&#039;m a little disappointed on the story but i still find it enjoyable to watch, well since this is a slice of life genre so there aren&#039;t gonna cover a lot of plots or arcs. Also if you notice the name &quot;REPEAT&quot; then you know what i&#039;m talking about. Although the story occur at the same year

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199215">
        as season 1, most of the content occur only before and after of the original scene back from season 1. Well though it disappoints me a little but that doesn&#039;t stop me from dropping this anime. I&#039;m glad they make the story not too complex or hard for a person to understand what they story is all about. Mostly likely they just recycled everything from season 1 but with different contents.<br />
<br />
The art and the sounds, i&#039;m glad that they didn&#039;t change completely except for the songs of course since this is season 2. The new OST are amazing too, wouldn&#039;t expect that quite a lot. The seiyuus remains unchanged which is good but i wonder why nii-san has no seiyuu, would love to hear his voice though. The OPs and EDs are more energetic than season one&#039;s. I really like the ED song so much. <br />
<br />
For the animations, nothing much special, same studio who made NNB from season 1, at least the animations aren&#039;t weird or have those fail animations. Background are not too saturated nor bland. While character designs remains identical to the first season, well since it is still run by the same staff. Overall, glad that the animations are not bad, quite decent. <br />
<br />
Well, because this anime has no specific plot, we don&#039;t have any motives what the character wants, but I do enjoy the characters in NNB. Hotaru just moved in from big city and learns a lot of new things in the rural area where there is not much in the city, she can be a childish, which well is kinda cute when she act like that. For Komari, I just love her height, I wanna pet her head like what Hotaru wanted to and I just love how Komari get scared easily when it comes to ghosts. Renge, I do enjoy watching her growing up for a year after entering 1st grade, like learning how to ride a bike without training wheels on etc, she is a kind of person who loves to learn new things or things that other is not aware of.<br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;ve enjoyed watching this and for a 12 episode series, it&#039;s not bad but how I wish the content would be a year after season 1, but they decided to just &#039;repeat&#039; it but still glad to watch it . I&#039;m glad to see Renge and also Komari again (two of my favorite characters in NNB). And don&#039;t forget about Nii-san too! And of course the rest. It has been a great summer for 2015&#039;, I&#039;m surely gonna miss the best SoLs that I have ever seen.<br />
<br />
Well, if there is season 3, I&#039;m all hyped for it.<br />
<br />
With that, I conclude my overall with 8/10<br />

    I wrote a review about season 1 and it will be kinda relevant to this one so it would be better to read it before this one, also SPOILER ALERT.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s rare to find a sequel to an anime which is the same level as the first season, most of the sequels are way worse like Darker Than Black and Aldnoah.Zero or just not as good like Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru and Black Lagoon and because of that I was very surprised by how good this sequel was compared to the first one.<br />
In this review I will talk only about the characters just like I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254075">
        did in the previous one because they are pretty much the deciding part so i&#039;ll start by saying that the characters in the 2nd season were way more interesting, for example:<br />
<br />
Hotaru turned from a character that only love Komari and nothing else to a better version of that, you could see that her personality was more fitting this time and she was kind and caring to almost everyone not just Komari, you could also see how she cares about other stuff too like anime and flowers which was very different compared to the first season, yeah she still has that weird way of thinking about Komari which I hope stays as a love for cute things and not anything else but other than it was actually nice to see her in the anime unlike the first season, but what really bothers me is that we never get to see her childish side other than that one time at the end of episode 11 and she was very adorable then, it would have been better if that was her main personality tbh.<br />
<br />
Komari was the same tbh which was a bit disappointing considering how good Hotaru changed from the previous season, she only had 1 mature scene when she and Hotaru got lost but other than that she was still childish with very little semi-mature moments that fit her age a little but I guess I got used to her so it wasn&#039;t that bad when she was on-screen.<br />
<br />
The borther who finally got recognized as a character, after the first season of him almost not existing he finally got screen time and it sure was worth it, his scenes were interesting and it was nice seeing him do his stuff even if he wasn&#039;t speaking at all.<br />
<br />
Natsumi was a lot better this season with probably one of the sweetest moments of the season when she helped renge by keeping the fish tank and cleaning it without the other one knowing out of concern for her, she was very lovely this season.<br />
<br />
Renge still cute and probably the best character but there is something weird when it comes to her, almost all bad things happen to renge and I don&#039;t really know why? in the first season her friend left in probably the most depressing episode in that season and this season her pets die and she gets sick! why does that only happen to her I will never know. <br />
<br />
Kaede is probably now my favorite character over renger because she is just way too good of a character, watching what she does and how she acts with everyone specially renge and the time she took care of her during the bicycle training and when renge was sick made her my favorite tbh, so caring and sweet at the same time, perfect Waifu and real-life Wife material. <br />
<br />
The rest of the characters were very nice as well with some of the side characters getting more time like Hikage, Kazuho, Konomi and the 2 mothers which was very nice to see.<br />
<br />
Overall: I really enjoyed it so 9/10.<br />
Would definitely recommend it.

    Non Non Biyori falls squarely into SOL moe cgdct territory but makes up for all of the generic tropes that come with that by setting itself in the countryside; effectively changing the characters, their interactions, and general way of life to make a unique experience that stands out in the SOL genre.<br />
<br />
Non Non Biyori Reapeat is, above all else, an improvement on literally everything the first season did.<br />
<br />
Repeat can be watched standalone, but I elected (and preferred) to watch the first season to get a feel for the show.<br />
<br />
Repeat brings back the full cast of characters from the first season and quite literally repeats that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308766">
        initial year of Hotaru&#039;s introduction to the rural utopia of Asahigaoka at different points. Providing more fleshed out characters, more self contained stories, and a plethora of wholesome moments that I couldn&#039;t help but clutch my heartstrings and say &quot;aww&quot; out loud over. I absolutely love this addition to the Non Non Biyori series.<br />
<br />
With the 3rd season of Non Non Biyori being confirmed (source: https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-05-11/non-non-biyori-tv-anime-gets-3rd-season/.146604) I HIGHLY recommend anyone familiar with the slice of life genre watch their fill of Non Non Biyori content before it comes out.

    *Spoiler warning!* *Short review!*<br />
<br />
It took me a little longer than I planned, but I finally finished the second season! And, I&#039;m definitely not disappointed with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story/Plot 7/10 - The plot is around the same as the previous season, focusing on the 4 girls (Plus some of the others) going around and doing fun, normal, usually boring things in their small town, and somehow making said things seem really fun!<br />
<br />
Art 7/10 - From what I remember the art style is the same, the colors are still as bright as before, but the resolution went up, and the quality is a little better.<br />
<br />
Sound 6/10 - Same as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403356">
        before, voice actors are still good too!<br />
<br />
Characters/Personalities 7/10 - Same as before. We did sort of see more characters this time around and I feel like there personalities are also good and they fit perfectly with the main characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall 7/10 - I&#039;d say this season was just as enjoyable as the last. I was kinda put off by the fact that no time has passed and instead it was just showing stuff they did in the previous season that we didn&#039;t see, but I quickly got over that and enjoyed it a lot! :D

    Leave behind your preconceptions of story development or smart character evolution. Detatch your mind from what silly necessity you feel of a strong plot, hard-hitting dialogue or particularly standout animation, for this is anything but. Forget about the stress of your weekday, light up a blunt and unwind, as Non Non Biyori Repeat is, for what it&#039;s worth, relaxation exemplified within animation. <br />
<br />
The series begins, and stays, within an unnamed rural town in the middle of nowhere. Featuring four little girls as our protagonists, their adventures through the lavish and quiet town they live in as the main focus, we&#039;re presented with an episodic structure

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199981">
        that plays it safe. The little group of friends is very charming, but none particularly stand out aside from Renge, a first-grader. Her escapades within her little world as she comes to understand her surroundings in a very childlike, yet sometimes surprisingly mature manner is just heart-melting. <br />
<br />
But I would say that the real protagonist of the series are those very surroundings that accompany the group throughout. The show&#039;s seemingly mundane, oddly relaxing atmosphere is beat by few, and as you further immerse yourself within its calm forests, ever-present meadows, and wonderful night skies, you begin to comprehend what the series is actually about.<br />
<br />
The seemingly slow pace then becomes a complete treat, as every new place visited in the series draws you further in: you forget about your day&#039;s troubles, the crazy city rush, and the stress emanating from your daily life. And then, it all comes together: the backgrounds, the characters, the dialogue. It&#039;s all equal to a slow melody that never quite builds up, but it stays pleasant throughout. Its instruments, smartly arranged to complement one another, holding your hand throughout the cozy experience. It&#039;s a feeling very few of these slice of life series manage to nail correctly. The series&#039; visuals are very well made, pretty much making the show, with neither backdrops or animation losing an ounce of quality, rock-solid consistency throughout as a strong point.<br />
<br />
As for music, however, it&#039;s a shame that the soundtrack isn&#039;t quite up to par. It&#039;s definitely not bad, but not particularly good, either. The sound design as a whole leaves a little to be desired, especially considering the series&#039; otherwise excellent execution.<br />
<br />
In all, if you feel like chilling out on a free day, few shows can be as amazingly relaxing as this. Strongly recommended, especially with moderate marijuana use. Just sit back and enjoy the warm, fuzzy high.
