    Dr.Stone is one of the most entertaining anime that made me feel accomplished<br />
after each episode. It is really satisfying seeing Senku and the others build modern things from scratch .<br />
<br />
This Season has the same feel as the first season which was obviously very Entertaining. A lot of new characters are introduced and each and every one of them are so cool.<br />
<br />
Story 9/10:<br />
The Story is Great and All of Senku&#039;s new inventions are pretty cool. We get to see things outside the village and The action is pretty good too.We even get to see more on Tsukasa&#039;s side and I really liked it.<br />
<br />
Art 9/10:<br />
The art is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386571">
        pretty nice too. What I like about the art is The color combinations used. It is really beautiful . The cracks on the characters faces are so unique and they bring more out of the surroundings.<br />
<br />
Sound 9/10:<br />
I really love this season&#039;s opening. It is really good and I cant move it out of my head.The OSTs are great too.I personally think Gen impersonating Lilian is the best.<br />
<br />
Character 9/10:<br />
There are a lot of new characters intoduced this season. Each and every one of them has got their own story . They all are looking great and have good voices. There is not much you can complain about.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9/10:<br />
This Season was pretty good just like the previous season which I really loved. The Character interaction,Personality, New inventions,Sound,Comedy and action were all on spot so I really enjoyed this season.<br />
<br />
Bye-Bye!!

    Dr. Stone is back, and it&#039;s back with a bang. It truly is, as if it never left the season it aired, and continues onward in it&#039;s entertaining scientific fun. Let me explain why.<br />
<br />
Story and characters<br />
We kick off where we left off in the previous season. From a bit more prep for the Stone Wars, but then now we&#039;re kicking it off. Senkuu&#039;s plan of action is in fully swing, and we&#039;re finally seeing it in animated form, and it&#039;s been super fun step by step. Makes you realize once again just how smart is this cocky and smart guy that Senkuu is, but also

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377755">
        reminds you just how lovable the cast is in their own way once again. From how well they support Senkuu, but also how well they mesh together like before. Along with some pretty interesting new faces, with interesting backgrounds to see, it&#039;s quite a fearsome side that Tuskasa certainly has gotten together. Some real good stuff here. To finally see long awaited returning faces after what felt like so long away. The Stone Wars are here, now we&#039;ll see how the battle concludes. <br />
<br />
Stone Wars keeps you interested, only wishing that it wasn&#039;t 24mins long, and was much longer, as you&#039;ll be wanting the next episode to come out as soon as the one you are watching is finished. We&#039;re all sitting here on the edge of our sea, anticipating to see how the Stone Wars end. <br />
<br />
Art and sound<br />
Dr. Stone has it&#039;s bit of own kind of style, and it&#039;s a good style. It&#039;s colourful, and can be very expressive. More so in certain situations when it comes to character reactions, and certain explanations. It&#039;s all well done there. Along with the sounds not only being fitting for each scene, but being great as per usual. <br />
<br />
Dr. Stone is as good as it was before. Maybe even more so, as it&#039;s next part is off with flying colours, and it&#039;s only going to get even better. So watch it now!

<br />
Dr. Stone with a banger of a first season, comes back with what we can call a modicum of the legacy of what it had left behind. I would call this season the smaller brother, talented yet not as much as its elder brother, the latter being the first season. Even with its significant flaws—being extremely fast paced, mundane story telling and characters popping out of nowhere and diminishing in the subsequent episode—there is still a lot to admire and love about this season. So let&#039;s dive into this 10

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386566">
        billion percent exhilarating review of Dr. Stone: Stone Wars!<br />
<br />
:: Story ~ 8 out of 10 ::<br />
I feel like compared to the first season, this season is a step-down when it comes to storytelling. It felt like it was progressing with great celerity, without trying to engage with the audience too much. It took Senku about 3-4 episodes to build the light bulb in the first season, and this season Senku built a freaking tank in 2 episodes. I would&#039;ve loved to see another 24 episode cour like the first season, or even a 13-14 episode cour to let the story flesh out a bit more smoothly. But I am in no way besmirching the show, cause for what it is, it is really enjoyable. It branched out from Senku being the main attraction to others like Chrome, Taiju, Yuzuriha and more which I really loved. <br />
<br />
:: Art &amp; Sound ~ 9 out of 10 ::<br />
The animation is good. As it is to be expected from any anime in 2021 (Ahem ahem, we don&#039;t talk about Ex-Arm). I&#039;ll not tergiversate and say, I used to hate the opening at first. But eventually it grew on me, and I couldn&#039;t help but listen to it every now and then on Spotify. This season conflates good animation with catchy music, which ameliorates the overall watching experience. No complains here!<br />
<br />
:: Characters ~ 8 out of 10 ::<br />
Although each character get their moment of fame. It is ephemeral. So you don&#039;t really bond with any character much this season. Even the show&#039;s most poignant moments, feel rather... dull, I literally felt nothing when Tsukasa&#039;s sister was de-petrified or when Tsukasa almost died. But since this was the second season, we already had a connection with most characters. All the characters add to the show&#039;s enjoyment and most of them are amiable in their own ways. Except Hyouga. We hate Hyouga.<br />
<br />
:: Enjoyment &amp; Overall ~ 9 out of 10 ::<br />
As a whole, I loved this season. Maybe not as much as the first one, but I still enjoyed it. It didn&#039;t live up to what I expected it to be, but oh well. I will be patiently waiting for season 3 which I hope they do make eventually. Dr. Stone is quite unique in its approach, where the protagonist fights using science and his brain, rather than plot armour, muscle and power of friendship. It would be a shame if they decide to drop it.

Dr. Stone: Stone Wars is the second major animated arc of the Dr. Stone manga, Riichiro Inagaki’s 2nd major serialized work in the Shounen Jump (Weekly) magazine, following Eyeshield 21. With one of the most unique art styles and premises of both 2019 and 2021, it’s no surprise why people find this series fascinating. Heck, it’s honestly a great contender for my personal anime of the season, and here’s why:<br />

Picking right up where we left off in season 1, we witness the Ishigami village prepare for the upcoming battle against Tsukasa’s army...except our protagonists are trying to actually

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386561">
        avoid battle. Now, if you’re looking for a shounen like My Hero Academia or Demon Slayer with tons of action, Stone Wars is not really the sequel I’d be looking for. Stone Wars follows up on the somewhat unrealistic, but exciting-to-watch antics and inventions of Senku and co. as they now create ‘weapons of warfare’ ranging from telephones, kevlar vests, and motor vehicles to reduce the number of casualties as much as possible. In my eyes, Stone Wars is not about war. It’s primarily about the clashing of ideals between the insanely buff anti-capitalists, Tsukasa and Hyouga, versus Senku, protector of the status quo and freedom of innovation. <br />
<br />
What makes Tsukasa and Hyouga more interesting to watch rather than typical villains is their lofty goals of creating a completely new world. However, if you watch critically, you will notice from very specific context clues within both seasons that Tsukasa and Hyouga are very different idealistically. After the deaths of the Tsukasa Army soldiers from the sulfuric acid pond, Tsukasa mourns and recalls their names while he reminisces over their bravery fighting the ‘murderous’ Senku with his weapons of science. Hyouga blanks and asks Tsukasa who these people were, implying Hyouga did not even remember the names of the soldiers he left for dead. Tsukasa is still unaware of Hyouga’s treachery and reminds him of the fabricated incident of the sulfuric pond. While Tsukasa is depicted to be emphatic and distraught over the loss of his soldiers, Hyouga is seen as an individual who does not care much for the lives of ‘the weak’. Even though the guy has destroyed countless stone statues, Tsukasa still feels like a human with genuine emotions because he cares for the common people. Rather than depicting Tsukasa as completely evil, the writers purposely wrote one of the primary antagonists as someone who we should sympathize for. On the other hand, we have Hyouga who we’ve learned is an individual who will sacrifice human lives for an agenda. He is also notably the only person to have killed/let someone die on-screen. If you factor in his blatant support of the destruction of stone statues, Hyouga’s ideals appear to align with fascism. He supports active ethnic cleansing of the human population, even amongst un-petrified people for an over-exaggerated ‘survival of the fittest’. As you watch more and more of this series, the darkness of Hyouga versus the idealism of Tsukasa becomes more and more evident.<br />
<br />
Then we have Senku and co. The most common criticism of Senku’s character is that he is a big-brain Gary Stu with zero weakness. That is simply not true. Senku has a weakness! Albeit a shounen cliche, we see time and time again that he will sacrifice himself for the sake of his friends. He always tries to keep them out of danger. Despite taking literal spears to the stomach and facing head to head with Death itself, he only does it for the sake of his friends. People don’t realize this because he NEVER TELLS you this. Even if it is not necessarily efficient or optimal, he will take the path safest for everyone. He always shows this weakness as a strength which makes him all the more likeable as a protagonist. Every invention or trap accommodates even people he is actively fighting against so no one is badly hurt. A combination of bad luck and bluff tactics makes him all the more believable and fun to watch. Even if it’s not always realistic, you have to give props to the writer for writing someone so interesting!<br />
<br />
If you have favorite characters that are not Senku, don’t worry, you are in luck. The spotlight this season definitely goes to Chrome and Gen with their own respective challenges, as well as some of the newer characters in Stone Wars. Chrome gets to play an escape-the-room scenario and actually prove his independence from Senku as someone equally passionate in science but significantly more realistic. While Senku might as well be God’s Hand Lite, Chrome is like the HSer trying his best to finish his chem lab before class ends. However, this makes Chrome much more interesting, as he discovers not just how to get out of a messy situation himself, but his own identity as a person. The crazy af antics Chrome always pulls never fails to get a laugh out of me cause I love the guy! He’s my favorite character in the series and it’s great to see him get some spotlight even if he’s not the main protagonist.<br />
<br />
For Mr. Asagiri Gen, master of bullshitting his way out of every situation, the guy is so fun to watch as he uses his skills as a liar to gain an advantage. His skills in the psychological department are so versatile, he might as well be Senku’s 2nd half! Although his primary role is certainly in the first half of the season, the visuals that TMS Entertainment uses to display his sleaziness is so damn entertaining I really can’t say anything bad about him! This is the kind of character we need in shounen! Not the dumb, loud, and screamy friend of the protagonist, but someone who is not only intelligent, but cunning.<br />
<br />
On the Tsukasa Army side, we got some interesting obstacle characters who indicate their own ulterior motives in addition to possible longevity for the future of the series. We have the guy with superhuman hearing, Ukyo, who provides a compelling challenge for our protagonists as they try to set up a cell-phone communication device. The guy can literally hear a tree branch fall from a mile away yet our protagonists still have to deal with him? He seems like an impossible challenge like everything else Senku and co. have dealt with, yet Ukyo never actively tries to physically injure anyone from Senku’s side...Ukyo’s board position in this tactical battle for communication raises some question marks for the audience, which makes a seemingly minor character provide more subtle details than one would expect. You’ll just have to watch to see what these details are.<br />
<br />
The last character I want to touch upon is Nikki. She is one of the other characters in the Dr. Stone setting that I personally found relatively well-done despite playing a minor role. She is one of the first people that Senku’s team tries to convince to abandon Tsukasa for a ‘better alternative’. Rather than just being one and done, Nikki is like your picky anime viewer, unsatisfied with just the bare minimum, and raises the stakes for Senku and Gen with her high standards and sends Senku and Gen’s team into a panic! The end result of the situation is certainly predictable, yet the way Nikki’s character presents her decision in relation to her backstory particularly struck a chord with me. Her background makes what would ordinarily be a plot device, feel significantly more real. Unlike Ukyo, Nikki’s own ideals are clear-cut and surprisingly match Senku’s. It is within her desire to preserve what she loved from the past and save the status quo. Nikki, despite freedom from the shackles of society in the Stone World, longs for that one thing that kept her going throughout her old life. I personally resonated with that so much. It made me appreciate another well-done character in the Dr. Stone World.<br />
<br />
Now, I know I’ve said a lot of compliments about Dr. Stone, but there’s a reason I cannot rate it any higher.<br />
<br />
Some of the minor issues are the iffy pacing at the beginning (including the recap; yes, I still remember that), and the presentation of Tsukasa’s backstory. Within 5 minutes, we learn how Tsukasa was traumatized by a bad experience and how he decided to enter MMA boxing and got beat up a lot. Except...it never explained how he became buff enough to literally one-shot a full-blown lion in season 1! And catch an arrow mid-shot! He’s still ‘the world’s strongest primate high schooler’ but he appears to have become larger than the Rock at around age 18 with scientifically unexplainable superhuman abilities. Even the Hulk would cry “Uncle!” after getting slapped by Tsukasa. If you were looking for how Tsukasa became the big man he is...you’re out of luck.<br />
<br />
The last bone I have to pick is the plot holes. There are so many plot holes. I’m willing to look past them because I love Senku and the gang, but there are at least two problematic scenes. One of them is when Tsukasa and his new ally look for someone important to Tsukasa. I will call this new ally, ‘Al’, and this important person, ‘Pal’. Why doesn&#039;t Tsukasa look for Pal on his own with his army? For some reason, Tsusaka chose to postpone un-petrification and wait til Al used that as leverage. Al essentially tricks Tsukasa into thinking that ‘together’, they found Pal. In reality, Tsukasa just found Pal by himself and thanked Al for doing nothing! Also, some of the fight scenes are unbelievably stupid as well. I won’t mention which one, but there is a specific scene with a spear that is mindblowingly dumb. If this certain spear-wielder either let go of their spear or thrust their spear forward, they could’ve killed someone and/or escaped unharmed. The tides of an entire battle are decided by this “ten billion percent” stupid decision that is not realistic.<br />
<br />
Even though I cannot look past some of the story-writing flaws, I still loved this season, even more than the first one. It truly is something I looked forward to watching every week while I suffered through online learning over Zoom, and I hope whoever is reading this will enjoy this series just as much as I did.

    About 2 years ago marked the debut of Dr. Stone on television. It’s a breath of fresh air to see Boichi’s unique art being translated into anime form. Almost 2 years later, we are once again blessed by this scientific storyteller known as Dr. Stone: Stone Wars. If you’ve been a fan of this franchise, then here’s some great news for you.<br />
<br />
Adapting the ‘Stone Wars’ arc from the manga, this season runs less than half the length of the previous season. It makes sense given the amount of storytelling from the manga. Any more than that would actually make the show less consistent. And speaking

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386573">
        of consistency, Stone Wars drop us right into the main story with Senku and his scientific mind. It takes a genius like him to think of ideas such as making space dried food and with help takes the fight right to Tsukasa. Again, I have to emphasize that Senku is a very intelligent individual with the characteristics of a leader. Plus, it also helps that he has the trust of his allies such as Kohaku, Chrome, Gen, Kaeski and among others. He’s a guy who is bold enough to take risks but also responds accordingly to different situations. Such traits makes Senku ideal to carry out dangerous operations.<br />
<br />
With the arc in full motion, there’s always time to also remind us the importance of the Stone War. Obviously, the show wants to prove a point and that is to showcase what science can really do in their timeline. Senku’s ability to craft complex inventions also shows that anything is possible. A prime example of this includes the steam engine. Dubbed as the Steam-Gorilla, it stands as a testament of scientific innovation. Sure, it’s not something mind-blowing that can change the fate of mankind. However, you have to admire that these characters were able to create something so complex with the tools they have. Of course, Senku is not the only character that embraces the love of science. Even Chrome, a guy with little scientific experience, preaches his newfound interest to characters such as Tsukasa. And really, I hope you’re a fan of Chrome this season because Stone Wars really puts him into a compromising position. <br />
<br />
With each episode progressing, it’s shown through the Stone Wars how characters fight their battles. Most noticeably is Senku and his ability to also use psychology as a source of weapon. He plays mind games with his opponents and throws them off with calculated moves. This show isn’t just superficial about science fiction. It also deals with the way characters execute their plans to keep fan engaged. Senku, Tsukasa, Hyoga and even Chrome are prime example of this. From the first half of the show, you can just see how much the author prepared for the big fight and even the aftermath. And indeed, one of the later episodes throws in together all the prominent characters into a physical clash and science warfare. It’s quite impressive to actually see inventions being put to use. The author could’ve easily had characters clash in a generic physical confrontation but Dr Stone is known for its creative innovations. Not everything is overly complex either such as dynamites and gunpowder being used as weapons. The key selling point is how every episode had its meaningful purpose in some way or another and not wasted. It does that by showing what characters can achieve through science.<br />
<br />
Because of the pacing and momentum, you may be wondering if there’s any concrete character development. The answer is sort of yes and no. On one hand, we do know more of about Tsukasa’s reason for fighting and even sees glimpses of his past. However, there are some characters this season that can easily be forgettable despite being there from the start. Oh yes, I’m talking about Tajiu and Yuzuriha. Does anyone even care about either character as pair anymore? Not me. The Stone Wars has been central point of this season that any sort of romantic development is practically null. <br />
<br />
It’s just 11 episodes but Dr. Stone: Stone Wars serves as an example of dazzling storyteller. It sells us what it advertises and remains faithful to the manga. With its established cast, we get to see first-hand on how much they put their skills to use. In the end, I didn’t even have a side to root for because the war itself isn’t just about who wins. It’s about making a world and how science can change mankind. And that’s an achievement I can’t help but praise for.

    Overall: 8/10<br />
Dr. Stone is basically a mix of those outrageous children&#039;s shows you&#039;d watch as a kid with high school and university science; Bill Nye on crack in other words. And I love every aspect of it. The outrageous characters, the smooth animations, and overall interesting story: what happened that caused the entire Earth to get petrified?<br />
<br />
Dr. Stone has done everything it did well in the first season and then some. Good action, innovative and resourceful use of science, and great synergy between characters. But I think what separates Dr. Stone from most other anime is their ability to pace their episodes amazingly. Dr. Stone

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386596">
        is that one long-distance kid in middle school gym class racing against those hot-headed chumps who sprint the first 50m and pass out afterward. Thanks to this pacing, Dr. Stone never feels like a bore to watch and development is always happening, no matter how big or small.<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
Dr. Stone doesn&#039;t have some profound, enriching story, but it has enough mystery to keep you entertained. So far, everything the show&#039;s introduced is grounded in realistic and entirely plausible science; as a result, we the audience know in advance that whatever secret there is behind the petrification, it won&#039;t be some hogwashed bullshit. Even supposed &quot;deus-ex machinas&quot; are very reasonable since we really don&#039;t know ANYTHING about the petrification device, meaning it can be effectively leveraged as a cure-all gimmick without seeming too over-the-top.<br />
<br />
Most importantly, Dr. Stone is able to execute this simple but effective story very well. The pacing always feels right; everything is being done for a purpose, and we rarely spend episodes where meaningful plot progression isn&#039;t made. This is already a huge up from most other anime, where they&#039;ll just plateau for 1 or 2 episodes before picking up steam again.<br />
<br />
Above all else, the story has done a great job of concluding this initial introductory arc and setting up the premise for the next one: to get their hands on a petrification device. That being said, I&#039;m already looking forward to the amazing worldbuilding that&#039;s on the way as we look to branch outside of Japan.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
I&#039;m a bit love-hate when it comes to Boichi&#039;s art style. Sometimes it looks really great, especially the designs for the guys. For some of the girls (looking at you Homura), it can come off as weird or even unsettling at times. Nothing you can do when you&#039;ve been a hentai artist for most of your life I guess. Aside from that, the animation is crisp and solid; not the best this season but a pretty damn good job overall.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
OP is fucking goated. No debate. ED is pretty damn good too, but I just love the OP&#039;s jazziness so much more. OST is great too, and always used to amazing effects: they help set the tone for every scene and interaction. VA is amazing as usual; I love how much the voice actors can get into their character and really appreciate all the effort they put in. You can hear how sly and seductive Gen sounds, or how pretentious and methodical Senku is. It really does bring Dr. Stone up to that next level and without it, Dr. Stone wouldn&#039;t be the same.<br />
<br />
Character: 7/10<br />
Same old outrageous characters that we all know and love. A lot of people hate how the characters can&#039;t be taken seriously, especially Senku who &quot;isn&#039;t realistic at all.&quot; They aren&#039;t really meant to be taken seriously. Senku&#039;s job is literally to serve as a proxy for humanity&#039;s knowledge of science. That&#039;s kinda the whole message the show is tryna preach you know. Now, were Tsukasa and Hyoga kinda cheap villains? Yea, but just like with Senku, the story isn&#039;t about some good guys triumphing over bad guys: it&#039;s about how amazing and powerful science can be.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
I fucking sucked at and hated chemistry in high school. SL Chem was absolute ass. But, I gotta admit that Dr. Stone does a great job of hyping science up and showing you how cool it can be. Also does a great job as an ego booster when they throw out the name of some organic molecule, theory, or application of chemistry that I know. Even if you don&#039;t understand everything going on, the show&#039;s still a great watch for its solid comedy, action, and chemistry (get it?) between their characters.

    I know this review might be a bit cotroversial. I also do know that it will be impossible for me to properly convey my feelings and throughts about this show with words as I simply lack the experience writing reviews.<br />
However I can atleast try.<br />
<br />
With that in mind I&#039;ll start by saying that the setting is the one thing that probably hooked me the most when I first watched the first season. After that was finished I was hungry for more. This is where the second season picks right up. Thus I expect readers of this review to have seen the first season.<br />
But let&#039;s go over

          <span style="display: none;" id="review379553">
        this one by one: <br />
<br />
Story<br />
The story in itself isn&#039;t that great to be honest, it portrays two philosophical views which are in opposition to each other. With the first season being the setup and beginning of the conflict the second season dives straight into it. My main gripe with it is that the core issues simply aren&#039;t adressed enough to really engage me into the story. <br />
Science is good and Tsukasa is bad. Tsukasa argues his points about science but Senku never really adresses these negatives, instead he just dodges these issues by showcasing the positives of the science side. Especially the &quot;no killing&quot; rule the science side adheres to had me confused. <br />
The setting itself comes into conflict with the writing. This is supposed to be a harsh world, reclaimed by nature over a span of thousands of years, yet it made surviving in it look laughably easy. Especially the concept of killing another human being confuses me here. Supposedly these villagers have been alone on the planet from the very beginning yet they know the meaning of taking someone elses life. In some cases they even suggest doing so, although it should be unheard of in their small community.<br />
Similar goes for the inventions made by Senku. At first they were fairly reasonable to a certain degree but as the &quot;level of technology&quot; advances and each invention gets more and more complex my suspension of disbelief simply falls apart. Everything just feels surface level to me, as if the author just made a quick wikipedia search while researching the next invention he&#039;s going to feature. <br />
I know this is a kids show but alot of the dialogue made me cringe abit. I can&#039;t put my finger on why it does.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
It&#039;s ok I guess, the animation is smooth, it looks just like the first season which makes it barely above average.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The OST isn&#039;t really memorable but the sound design in itself is fairly convincing. All in all pretty good.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
I really like all of the different characters, I have to admit they&#039;re well written and pretty much carried the bulk of the first season. However I feel like they are abit wasted or don&#039;t really fit the setting. I have a feeling they&#039;d fit much more into an anime with a modern setting or dare I say it a Slice of Life show.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
Due to the issues outlined in the story portion of the review my personal enjoyment of this show was severely diminished, which made me drop it in the end. No other qualities such as the characters were good enough to redeem it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall this is a 5.5/10 for me. I ultimately dropped it due to the waste of potential becoming more and more apparent.<br />

    If you&#039;re a fan of the first season of Dr. Stone, then you have to give the second season a try. The second season picks up right where the first season stopped and is full of action since the first episode. All our favourite characters are back, including the quirky ones (isn&#039;t this almost all of them? haha). The animation is still on par with the first season as well as the sound and general approach to the series.<br />
<br />
Story is still progressing at a decent pace, but there is still much left to be told and if the OP is anything to go by, then

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377758">
        there are a lot more surprises in store for us as the kingdom of science advances forward. After all, they have a lot of the basic tech in place so it&#039;s only going to get much BIGGERRRR!!!!! Overall, still an enjoyable experience that I would highly recommend any fans to watch!

    Honestly, I feel like I&#039;m going crazy seeing the general reactions everyone has about this show. It is possible that everyone who isn&#039;t a complete fanboy has already dropped the it, but I thought Season 1 was decent enough for me to give Season 2 a shot.<br />
<br />
For an action shounen which set up this season as a big war between the two factions of the story, the action is unbelievably underwhelming. The battle scenes are awkwardly directed, the tension is non-existent since every fight gets resolved in an instant, and the animation/sound are serviceable at best.<br />
<br />
This series&#039; strong suit has always been the cute ways

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386708">
        Senkuu uses science in order to solve problems, and while there is a decent amount of that in this season too, it&#039;s not enough to make up where the show is lacking (every other department). It seems like this show was made to just appeal to the kids who paid attention in science class during middle-school.<br />
<br />
Other popular shounen series haven&#039;t exactly set the bar too high in terms of characters/dialog/story etc. but Dr. Stone somehow manages to not even meet my fairly low expectations. The characters are bland and have no chemistry at all, the villains&#039; motivations seem convoluted at first but eventually you realize that the author just didn&#039;t think about it all that much, and Tsukasa&#039;s backstory is the first time a piece of media has made me laugh at a little girl being in a coma. <br />
<br />
Lastly, the humor is just bad. This show is not funny (at least not intentionally).

    Before I start this review, I must say that I have never been the biggest fan of the Dr. Stone anime.<br />
<br />
While I felt that the first season was solid, I was underwhelmed. I always felt that despite having an interesting premise and a good gimmick of watching someone create modern technology in a stone age, this adaptation fails to improve upon the source material. I haven’t even read the manga, but I can tell pretty clearly how the manga panels would look given the layouts and frames of this adaptation.<br />
<br />
This second season of Dr. Stone does nothing to change this flaw and even fails to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386660">
        live up to the first season due to a really fast pace that takes away the best aspect of Dr. Stone. The process of creation.<br />
<br />
What makes Dr. Stone so unique and appealing to a wide audience is how it shows Senku creating modern technology using basic materials. The audience feels like they are learning something and they get to experience the pleasure of it being completed without experiencing the labor and effort put in to actually create it. <br />
<br />
While this took a prominent role in the first season, it is all but gone in this one. For most of the scientific creations, we do not see the process of it being made. Instead, we get Senku pitching the idea a quick highlight reel of them creating it (if even that), or we see the creation as it is completed and the process for making it is quickly summarized after the fact. <br />
<br />
The problem with doing this is that we do not get a reasonable understanding of how much time it took to complete the technology, how they were able to get all of the resources, or how exactly they created it. These factors are all very important for an anime ABOUT making modern science and technology in a primative time. It is necessary to establish some level of believability.<br />
<br />
My assumption is that we did not get such an in-depth look at the process for creating the technology because they had to focus on the actual war between Senku’s camp and Tsukasa’s camp. The only problem is that there is hardly any action in this war, and when there is action, this adaptation fails to bring the source material to life.<br />
<br />
For everyone expecting a big war between the two camps like in the cover poster or in promotional pictures, you will be disappointed. The war is more like a Cold War if anything. But when the fighting actually starts, the animation relies so much on static frames that there is nothing to get hyped over. During the fights, it is often confusing where everyone is in relation to each other and how much time is passing in the story world. While these things may be more forgiveable in a manga, they are deal-breaking in an anime. It only leads to confusion and a break in immersion from the anime.<br />
<br />
One last thing I want to talk about in this season specifically is how they handled Tsukasa’s character. *MINOR SPOILERS* in the rest of this paragraph, so skip to the next paragraph if you don’t want to know. I did not like how much they backtracked to make his character more likeable and sympathetic. This man destroyed statues of adults with the intent of killing them as an act of genocide. Changing his views or giving him a sob story does not change that. *END OF MINOR SPOILERS*<br />
<br />
Everything else in this season is very similar to the previous one, for better or worse. I still do not like the comedy in this series because it relies too much on a character making a “funny” face. While this may work better in the manga, the faces are always drawn out for too long and ruin what little shock value humor that they had. The art is still good for close-ups on characters, but the scenery is bland and generic. I still do like how unique the OST is with using older instruments, but it seems like they moved away from that a bit and used more modern instruments this time around.<br />
<br />
This series is one that usually leaves me disappointed by the end because of how its potential is wasted due to a poor adaptation. If you liked the first season, then you will probably like this one as well. If you didn’t like the first season, then I would not recommend watching it. The season after this one looks promising, so I may watch it when it airs.<br />
<br />
It is closer to a 6/10 than a 4/10

    Preliminary review:<br />
<br />
Dr. Stone: Stone Wars has thus far been just as great as the first season, and continues to demonstrate why it sets itself apart from other Shounen Jump adaptations.<br />
<br />
Scientific achievements and progress definitely feel accelerated compared to the first. With the whole village supporting him now, we see Senku transition to the role of strategist and mentor as the Kingdom of Science plans their &quot;attack&quot; on Tsukasa. Every piece of new technology really gives you a sense of actual progression, and it&#039;s interesting to see the different ways that Senku uses this new tech for betterment of the village, and to gain an edge

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377716">
        against Tsukasa.<br />
<br />
Overall, this season has been just as enjoyable of a watch as the last, if not more - there were times during the first season where things got a bit draggy. Definitely recommend watching this if you even remotely enjoyed the first season.

    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
Science is not a power. It&#039;s a process. And every engineer would tell you that it&#039;s messy, that error is a fact of life, and we reduce but not eliminate them. Getting things to work in real life is fundamentally different than just applying theory. There needs to be the right purity of materials, the right amount and shape. And even when everything is perfect, there could just be electromagnetic interference from the environment. <br />
<br />
And that&#039;s where Dr. Stone goes wrong. It imagines an ideal world where being book smart is equivalent to being a creator, and everything is perfect on the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387172">
        first try. This is no small nitpick, but seriously distracting, and a pervasive narrative flaw throughout the entire show. It informs the characters&#039; thought processes. When Senku isn&#039;t recalling the encyclopedia that he has somehow memorized, he&#039;s making baseless conjectures about magical revival powers from petrification, where people&#039;s sisters might be buried, the net worth of a celebrity and their popularity and credibility. So much so that he bases his entire plan upon what is essentially a Hail Mary strategy, where if just one opponent is not moved by a celebrity performance and informs Tsukasa, the entire plan goes up in smoke. And in every instance, the world cedes to his will. He stakes life and death on a gamble about the magical properties of petrification, and he gets rewarded every time. Because whether he knows the facts or not, he&#039;s always right. Senku isn&#039;t so much about the scientific method, he just has memorized a lot of scientific facts.<br />
<br />
This looseness with reality infects the other parts of the show as well, and the plot falls apart with a bit of scrutiny. A genius with superpower hearing could hear rustling bushes, but not people loudly arguing in front of them. A gymnast is so flexible that she not only trapezes through trees, but no one could simply tackle her. Characters are so strong that they easily beat mountain gorillas on a talk show and blow other people away like dust. Tsukasa&#039;s sister falls into a coma and remains a 6 year old body for 10 years before even the petrification. A key character bleeds out and should have gone into septic shock given the puddle of blood, but revives conveniently in the nick of time.<br />
<br />
But perhaps the most questionable plot hole is how both Senku and Tsukasa were high school students before the petrification, and still hold naive ideals that put them on a kindergarten level. Senku has experienced the modern world as it is, and still thinks that everyone in the world would contribute solutions for a hunger problem. Was he so sheltered that he didn&#039;t think homeless people exist? Similarly, Tsukasa has experienced the modern world, and still thinks he could maintain a hunter gatherer society, that no one would ever have any ulterior motives. Despite their brilliance and infinite memory and strength and unscientific capabilities, all the characters are oddly stupid in a way that only really appeals to the shounen audience. <br />
<br />
Every protagonist develops a streak of naive pacifism, constantly preaching the importance of not killing a single enemy, when their way of life and their own lives hang in the balance. For a bunch of natives who once held a violent competition for marriage, and a bunch of grown ups from a modern age, it&#039;s hardly reasonable that everyone becomes simultaneously hung up on such an ideal. It almost feels like they wrote it in as a public service announcement for the children, to appeal to the censors, which would only have made sense if they had exported the script writing to Malaysia.<br />
<br />
Like maybe if you had the foresight of a monkey and never read Lord of the Flies or watched From the New World, then you could buy into the premise of Dr. Stone. Otherwise, Stone World just exacerbates the same problems as the first season with childish toy characters built around archetypes and spectacles instead of real nuanced human beings, a genius walking encyclopedia that talks like a pot head, and a forgiving world that treats them like undefeatable main characters reincarnated into an isekai. Sure, Tsukasa could have easily killed Senku in a pit fight, but that opportunity would never come. Do not mistake potential danger that could never happen with real danger -- the different lies in the transparency of an author&#039;s inept storytelling.

    What a dissapointment....<br />
<br />
Story: I might have forgotten but in my memory story of the first season seems pretty decent. For sure I can&#039;t say this about season two. Most of the inventions would have been either useless or not as important as 10 million other things. But yet they are still being used the most pretentious ways. It makes the anime look like a cheap circus IMO. I can&#039;t find almost anything good to say about the story here.<br />
<br />
Art: Art style is still good and unique.<br />
<br />
Sound: OP is great, ED is fine. Music in some scenes is just awesome.<br />
<br />
Character: Characters here are almost as bad

          <span style="display: none;" id="review390112">
        as the plot. One thing might explain it all: almost all the henchmen of Tsukasa willingly betrayed him when they had a chance. Worth mentioning that Tsukasa himself wasn&#039;t too sure about his worldview. That makes all the season worthless IMO.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I genuinely don&#039;t understand why so many people enjoy the show. I only find it worth watching in the company of friends and with some alcohol involved. Strangely I&#039;m still going to check out the next season as I think the potentail of the anime is not fully wasted for now. Let&#039;s hope for the better.<br />
<br />
Overall: strong 2.

    *This review was written after watching all eleven episodes of Dr Stone and may contain some spoilers *<br />
<br />
I’ll admit that the second season was much better than the first, however the anime is still not that great and could be improved on. It has still it’s major flaws mentioned by Krunchyman on the first season of Dr.Stone regarding how the show loves to over exaggerate things and put it way over the top. Character development in this show is literally non-existent and does not stay consistent with one person. Not only this, but many of the episode scenes were rushed and did not felt meaningful

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386755">
        to the viewer. An example of this is when Tsukasa and Hyoga were fighting against Senku and the group (Some of them joined from Tsukasa’s plan) but suddenly later on in the episode, we see Hyoga betraying Tsukasa to get the upper hand, so that he can take control and be the powerful leader he desires to be. We do not see any logical justification why he is unexpectedly backstabbing him now. Not in the least.<br />
<br />
We know that Tsukasa purpose in the first place to destroying the statue was so that as stated by himself is “We can dismiss the established powers who do nothing but take from the young nots and a create a new world” Hyoga dismisses Tsukasa ideology and plan as anything but absurd as apparently “if we’re left with nothing but brain dead youths, we still be taken from in order to keep them fed” yet his logic is to allow only the elites to survive is such a naive plan and does not make any sense because how does he not know that these “Elites” could end up backstabbing  him later on and want everything for themselves, just like how he is doing with Tsukasa. Moreover, I did not feel anything when it came to Tsukasa Death or when his sister Mirai came back alive because the show does not like to put any emphasis on this. Also, characters like Taiju and Yuziraha are barely ever talked about. Do we even care about them anymore at this point?<br />
<br />
Another ridiculously ludicrous thing we see in the show is how the characters are so quickly swayed that they practically abandon Tsukasa&#039;s army like flies to join Senku to be a part of a &quot;Science revolution.&quot; Nikki san&#039;s undying love for Lillian Weinberg Music and how it supported her throughout her former school life was the only one that I really enjoyed, made sense, and felt meaningful as to why she left to join Senku. But when it comes to Ukyo’s turn, you can tell that the anime studio rushed it and had to come up with something on the last spot. Because suddenly he’s a kind-hearted person and doesn’t want anyone to die? Lol, give me a break. The anime can do WAY better than this. It’s just so disappointing. Despite this, characters like Mentalist Gen contributed majorly to the show and is entertaining to watch. Overall, character developments and story are mediocre at best in this season.<br />
<br />
The only good aspects of this anime is that viewers are interested how Senku is going to bring the stone age back to modern civilization using the different sort of inventions he is creating with his kingdom of science buddies. The way the anime studio (TMS Entertainment) executes how Senku does these inventions along with the comedy is quite ingenious and something I will give credit for. When it comes to Art and sound, Dr. Stone has its own distinct and vivid style, and it is a good one.<br />
<br />
Just like the first season, this show is 5 billion percent average and if you agree with me on this, 10 billion points to you - *High fives*. Anyways, I just hope that they can take the character development a bit more seriously in the upcoming season 3 and that the story doesn’t get into conflict as much as when it comes to the philosophical views between the protagonist and the antagonist; like it did with this season.<br />

    Jesus Christ I love this show, I had a blast since I started watching it in 2019, it&#039;s been 2 years and the show keeps getting better and better.<br />
<br />
<br />
STORY: 10/10<br />
<br />
So this season and the last the bad guy was Tsukasa, but now that he&#039;s gone I have no clue what the hell they&#039;re gonna do, I mean, whatever the case is I can&#039;t wait to see the next season. Never seen anything like this done before, and I actually hope no other anime does something like this, not only because I think it will never be as good as this, but also because I want

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386669">
        this to be the only one of it&#039;s kind.<br />
<br />
<br />
ART: 10/10<br />
<br />
So the art is decent, BUUT because I loved how they made that one element that I&#039;m too dumb to remember the name of in to a cure waifuu it&#039;s a 10.<br />
<br />
<br />

    After the huge fall of the first season where the anime just got too boring with no interesting elements being added, I can surprsingly say that Dr.Stone is one of the most entertaining anime of the season. <br />
<br />
What made this season better than the prequel is pretty much the pacing, the first season had some episodes that felt like fillers and some which were just &quot;I&#039;m smart so I can solve anything&quot; but this one didn&#039;t feel like that. The characters were planning beforehand and the side characters had actual roles and weren&#039;t just place so Senku can show how smart he is and impress

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386769">
        them. That change while albeit small, was able to push the anime to what I think is the peak of its potential. I doubt it can get better than that but I guess we will see in S.3 <br />
<br />
The art, animation, directing and sound were decent but I have to say I was disappointed at some of the fights and how they ended. <br />
<br />
Overall, I would give it a 9/10. It was a surprisingly good anime. <br />
Would recommend it if anyone can bare the very slow and way worse first season.

    This is a review of both season 1 and 2.<br />
<br />
Dr. Stone is an example of how a good idea can be ruined by a bad writer.<br />
<br />
The entirety of humanity got turned to stone and civilization as we know it ceased to exist. 3700 years have passed and the miracle cure for the petrification drops on the biggest know-it-all onion head in the planet so he would trivialize the whole premise. The idea of the show would&#039;ve made for an interesting survival story if the protagonist Senku wasn&#039;t such a perfect being. This show also has some of the worst elements of Shounen pushed to the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review399641">
        extreme in plot, characters, and humor. The main conflict of the show so far seems forced and unnecessary to its premise. The only good part of the show is the science and that&#039;s what most people watch it for, unfortunately it&#039;s surrounded by crap.<br />
<br />
___________<br />
<br />
Dr. Stone&#039;s premise is pretty interesting. You wake up in a world with no civilization and could bring back a limited amount of people back based on the amount of petrification cure you have. The immediate strategy is to bring back those that will help you survive and thus we&#039;d have a small group of specialists that help each other survive.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Senku is an absolute genius. He knows literally everything. His brain is so much better than everyone else that he can keep counting seconds for 3700 years and be able to tell the date after all those years. The fact that the one person brought back from petrification is Senku eliminates any threat and forces the writer&#039;s hand in making a terrible villain such as Tsukasa to raise the stakes. The show trivializes survival in the wild.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most of the worst story elements are a result of some of the over dramatic twists that the writer is forced to keep people&#039;s attention due to another bad story decision. The writer makes Senku a perfect know-it-all so he has to introduce Tsukasa to keep the story going. Senku loses access to the petrification cure so he magically finds some random cavemen that have no place in the story to keep him going. Heck even given the history of these cavemen it doesn&#039;t make sense at all their lack of technology. The nature of Shounen manga comes into play here as you need to keep each chapter in your manga eventful to keep your ratings up.<br />
<br />
The conflict of the show is the biggest problem as Tsukasa isn&#039;t interesting in the slightest and his goal just doesn&#039;t work. Bring back only youth and they&#039;ll still rebel cause I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll find even 1 person out of 1000 that would agree with his goals and he can&#039;t really know their thoughts before bringing them back. Even if he just threatens them it will only be a matter of time until they grow in numbers and backstab him. Heck even if they didn&#039;t his generation will grow older and he will have a difficult time convincing the next generation or those unpetrified later on.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Stone Wars&quot; is as much of a disappointment as the survival part of the show. It was too easy. No one got seriously hurt and people flip sides too easily. Makes the whole conflict feel dumb and unnecessary. The problem is that Tsukasa was also revealed to actually not believe in his own goal and they asspulled a justification for his actions that he conveniently didn&#039;t try to discuss with his &quot;best friend&quot; Senku before deciding to kill him.<br />
<br />
<br />
The characters in the show aren&#039;t interesting in the slightest. Every character is so hyper and over exaggerated you can&#039;t take them seriously. The humor is passable at best and obnoxious at worst. The problem is that all the humor is so in your face that it&#039;s impossible to ignore. Gen asagiri makes me cringe. <br />
<br />
The action in this show is so badly telegraphed and hard to follow. They overuse of still shots with exaggerated backgrounds and many of the fights don&#039;t make sense or outright don&#039;t work logically. The art is not bad but the character design for the primary characters is not my cup of tea, however the character design for Tsukasa&#039;s followers is laughable as they all look like swole cavemen even though he&#039;s supposed to bring back the youth.<br />
<br />
<br />
The main strength of the show is its use of science to educate and to drive the show. The show is most interesting when the science drives the characters action rather than some dull character drama. That makes the only characters I care for to be Senku and Chrome for being the only two people in the world capable of science.<br />
<br />
Everyone else is just there to hype them up, especially Senku. Kohaku is usually the hype character as whenever Senku does something she gives some sort of speech as to how good of a person he is. She also orgasms at every mention of Taiju throughout the series which is odd tbh. Also, out of all the characters she was the one to make some heartwarming speech of how good a person Tsukasa is after we get to know his flashback. These are some examples of the writer hamfisting reasons for us to like a character instead of allowing us to make our judgements based on their actions.<br />
<br />
The music to the show is pretty hype and is probably why people eat up the nonsensical dramatic moments of the show.<br />
<br />
___________<br />
<br />
In conclusion, Dr. Stone can be pretty fun if you just look at the scientific segments and ignore it&#039;s dumb plot, action, and characters. The first season is better than the second since it spends more time on scientific parts than on dramatic BS.

    The main appeal of Dr. Stone is very similar to that of other anime such as Log Horizon, Overlord, No Game no Life, and That Time I reincarnated as a Slime: The civilization building aspect. It is aimed for people who find joy in seeing a character starting from the bottom and slowly building a better world for his friends and allies. It also has a videogame feel in how technology progresses, since the tech tree, sort of speaking, is about discovering something that unlocks something else. That can be very appealing to gamers who fancy the game mechanic of combining items and creating new

With that said, it’s also not a ground-breaking show or that well written. It has minimal tension in the challenges the protagonist faces and it is full of juvenile comedy, so it never comes off as, let’s say, Castaway (that movie starring Tom Hanks). It’s closer to Gilligan’s Island. It doesn’t show right away in the first season, since there were moments when Broccoli Boy (Senku) would be failing numerous times, or when he would need to spend months on something before there is progress. It was enough for giving a sense of struggle and how nothing is easily achieved. The second season doesn’t do that anymore, as Broccoli Boy does everything right and very fast, thus nothing is at stake. This is partly because Broccoli Boy wasn’t the main character in the first episodes. It was that generic friend of his, who didn’t know shit about SCIENCE! During the episodes when he was the protagonist, the show was way more like a proper action/survival. Then it changed to a silly comedy running on easy mode.<br />
<br />
What that basically means is that you shouldn’t go into Dr. Stone expecting great action and suspense. Everything in it is easy-going and becomes almost like a feel-good anime. The second season is called Stone Wars and there is no war in it. The battle was won with zero casualties through SCIENCE! and mind games, rather than brute force, which comes off as anticlimactic, but also somewhat intellectual. And I say somewhat, because it’s not that smart of a show either. It doesn’t have the thriller mind games of anime such as Death Note or Kaiji. It’s just that it does its best to solve its problems in peaceful and often comical ways, which, as I said above, kill all the tension and make the show to be quite breezy with its conflicts.<br />
<br />
This wouldn’t be much of a problem if it didn’t go against the core theme of the show, which is showing how brutal life can be without the conveniences of SCIENCE! and therefore needing SCIENCE! so it won’t be that brutal. Without having any stakes, there is nothing to risk and there is no clear indication as to why technology is that much of a big deal when the primitive natives are living on Gilligan’s Island. In fact, the show is so breezy it doesn’t even bother to show the negative aspects of SCIENCE! and thus comes off as hypocritical whenever it is celebrated in a one-sided way. Technology can be just as devastating as it is helpful, and yet that aspect doesn’t show anywhere.<br />
<br />
And yes, there are still lots of situations where they make it seem like someone is going to die or that things are very grim, but it’s always proven to be fake tension, since Broccoli Boy is solving everything too easily. You cannot take it lightly when the show itself doesn’t want you to take it lightly, thus it often comes off as hypocritical. What’s the point of having wars when they can’t kill anyone and nobody ever dies? Why have fake tension instead of just being prehistoric Lucky Star?<br />
<br />
Anyways, the proper way to enjoy this anime is to be in a mood for an easy-going feel-good show. It’s not serious or smart, as the civilization building aspect has nothing realistic about it, the characters are mouthpieces for exposition of the technology than actual people with depth or much of a personality, the conflict in nonexistent, science comes down to a videogame, and the fake tension is only making all that pretentious. Just don’t go around calling it a breath of fresh air, because unlike most anime it doesn’t have much violence. It’s not much of an excuse when you can just as easily say K-On is a breath of fresh air because it doesn’t have the violence of Berserk.

    Ok, this was probably one of the best anime for this 1st quarter of 2021...shit , the Covid 19 ain&#039;t over yet....anywayz, I&#039;ll just get down to business:<br />
<br />
Story-Good 7: When you have a sequel that was set in some rebooted stone age, where there will be a face off between brains of team Senku vs brawns of team Tsukasa , you&#039;re suppose to bound to get some action, much to my dismay it somewhat never happened and thing simply just ends in a good note.....but, I just can&#039;t fathom as to how pathetic the original creator, Inagaki Riichiro, has with some of Senku&#039;s invention like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387941">
        a cellphone where  it don&#039;t look like a cell phone , rather it was more like a two way radio, and the car or tank that was nothing more than a steam locomotive build to run on the ground, IMAO, either all that work has made him a dumb boy or he was just making the main character Senku Ishigami exaggerate.<br />
<br />
Art-Poor 3: Though, this series doesn&#039;t rely on the fanservices to sell, the illustrations were just damn too dirty.<br />
<br />
Sound Poor 3: I&#039;ll never understand as to what&#039;s going on the minds of the studio exe from TMS Entertainment as to why they&#039;ve chose mature sounding seiyuus to voiced them characters.<br />
<br />
Character-Mediocre 5 : Ok so in general we got whole gang back and some new side characters, in general they did what was expected in a sequel. But, just like in the sequel, the characters themselves still have their usual annoying traits , like Senku who invents things that seemly were contrary to what the inventions were, Tsukasa whom at one point has this very dictatorial tendency at one point and becomes this very logical guy next. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment-Good 7: Despite of only running for 11 episodes, I can say that it was all worth it.<br />
<br />
Overall- Very Good 8: Given that this could be the ending of the series, it looks like a 3rd sequel, so I&#039;d say, why not.....btw highly recommended , if you don&#039;t mind the short comings.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    Dr. Stone is an anime that is absurd and illogical in its core, and there is nothing wrong with that by itself. The anime&#039;s proposal is executed well in season 1, and its really funny to see Senku&#039;s wacky solutions to modernize the village. The main idea is to be absurd and you should not take it seriously. However, I couldn&#039;t keep doing it when they added elements to make the story more serious, such as Ideology and War.<br />
<br />
Our protagonist Senku is not terrible but he is indeed one of the lamest. Lead heroic characters are supposed to have goals to push the story forward,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review391428">
        to change the world, break the status quo and to care about the people around them. Senku lacks all of this. His motivation actually is to maintain the status quo, to bring everyone and the old world back, that includes re-stablishing countries with terrible, corrupt, war tyrant leaders. He never thinks about the problems the old world had and wants it all back. Why? Because science is cool, I guess.<br />
<br />
The one who actually plays the role of the hero is Tsukasa. With the little screentime he is granted, he manages to be the one with the best motivations. And the anime just can&#039;t make him look like a bad guy, they only say he is &quot;authoritarian&quot; or &quot;extremist&quot; to put him as the evil one, but the actual only reason we have to not root for him is because he is against our beloved Senku.<br />
<br />
And when the story tries to be more serious, some things like constant plot devices and Senku pulling things out of his ass become really boring. This, and the lawful good rule of never killing, even though they&#039;re in a war, just one of the story&#039;s ways to avoid conflict between the characters. And Senku never has any conflict nor development in this entire series. It&#039;s really boring to see this guy bullshit his way to victory, specially when his motivations are selfish and vague.<br />
<br />
In other aspects, the characters with most screentime are either Edgy Annoying Dumbasses (Chrome, Senku, Ginro) or Generic Evil Buffed Guys (Magma, Yo Uei, most of Tsukasa&#039;s minions). Well, we have Gen who is really interesting and outstanding, but it&#039;s a rare case. Most of the good characters are reduced to the background cast and barely do anything. The best example of this might be Kohaku, who first appears as a badass character just to receive the girl in shounen treatment and never get any relevance.<br />
<br />
Well, she is still there to give us fanservice, just like her sister who was supposed to be the smartest and most important person of the community but barely has any scenes, and when she has one it&#039;s a hentai reference. Just like any women in shounen, it&#039;s presumed they&#039;re there also to serve as love interests to Senku or Chrome, the latter being a piece of trash whose personality is just being a dumber version of Senku who mistreats Kohaku, despite her showing to like him and care about him a lot. This said, Dr. Stone could&#039;ve been way better replacing Chrome with Kohaku.<br />
Talking about the girls I have to mention that their design is awful and I don&#039;t understand why the author just can&#039;t draw their face normally. <br />
<br />
I may have been harsh on my review but this anime is not a bad one, it&#039;s just more of the same. There are some cute and wholesome scenes like Ruri recovering, Suika and Kinro using glasses for the first time and Byakuya&#039;s final message to Senku. And the beginning was good, because it looked like something different from the usual, and I recommend the first season if you don&#039;t mind the annoying side-characters. My main complaint about Dr Stone is it looking like it would be way better, and it had some cool elements, but didn&#039;t know what to do with them.
