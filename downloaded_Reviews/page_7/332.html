    Move over, Grand Blue (despite the MAL score) and Hinamatsuri (Spring 2018&#039;s best comedy)!<br />
<br />
Asobi Asobase is here to take your place not just as AOTS for Summer 2018&#039;s super weak BUT strong comedic presence, but also AOTY for the overall yearly comedy genre, and I have the full experience to tell you why this series is damn underrated, and hidden behind it is pure insane high school gag-comedy...AT ITS BEST AND FINEST!<br />
<br />
If there was a rating above 10, I would give this series a multiplier 100/10, because this is more than just some mindless AF comedic masterpiece. It&#039;s comedic execution will creep you with its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289755">
        insane amount of gag comedies, obscene figures, face expressions and all-so-you-desire thoughts straight in your face that make you question much! Oh, and the endless amount of references that got us SO DAMN GOOD and satisfying!<br />
<br />
Not every episode is perfect, but I&#039;m willing to forgive the little boring moments it has for the never-ending amount of laughs and tears combined freckle down my face as I wait upon every Sunday night for this series to start my week into, and I was never once disappointed, not one bit.<br />
<br />
Oh, what is Asobi Asobase about? Sorry, I&#039;m still laughing and crying at the metajokes it contains...I can&#039;t breathe...which series SUCCEEDINGLY sells your soul away in a good way in just 3 minutes, that makes you feel like this is something special?<br />
<br />
Asobi Asobase not a story in itself, but rather the characters themselves who form the core of the series with their distinct personalities:<br />
Hanako Honda (CV: Hina Kino, Toji no Miko&#039;s Sayaka), she is that kind of friend where she wants to desire fame and recognition and the likes by hanging out around normies, just with many screws loose, and her constant insanity striking out as always. Oh, and her weird fashion sense. Together with her assistant butler Maeda, he is the ultimate of ultimates, always helping her out with his shogi butt-beam, super-weird stuff ensues. <br />
<br />
Kasumi Nomura (CV: Konomi Kohara, Tsuki ga Kirei&#039;s Akane), she gives off the vibe that feels like the outcasted member of the class, and with her serious but scary punk-ass attitude, along with being a study nerd, she is the least of the 3 girls who would stand out, but damn, she&#039;s noticeable once we come into her senses, immediately realize she is not all the others would say: calm and elusive on the outside, but determined to follow-through on the inside. Oh, and her illterate struggle of English and her constant bad luck in games.<br />
<br />
Olivia (CV: Rika Nagae, Frame Arms Girl&#039;s Baselard), she is the oh-so-typical white girl which makes her look like the natural-born foreign exchange student, until you realize that all that is a trick, a demeanor to surprise you: She CANNOT speak a literate word of English, was born in Japan, but the best part about her is that despite her shortcomings, she tries to blend in with no F&#039;s given whatsoever. Oh, and her insane otaku of a brother, that despite his appearances, blue eyes blue in similarity, and he&#039;s the culmination of gross, smelling high school girls&#039; scents.<br />
&quot;Praise be to raw middle schoolers.&quot; - Olivia&#039;s fatso Onii-chan<br />
<br />
Oh, and not forgetting the side cast:<br />
- The female teacher responsible for the Pastimers Club,<br />
- The general-purpose teacher who confines along with the 3 girls, like licking lied-pee (but is water) and their game antics (with the insane Sailor Moon and DBZ references),<br />
- The Student Council Prez and vice-prez, who literally has no holds barred,<br />
- The Occult Club, who knows what the 2 girls are doing in there, anything they concoct up is always up to no good.<br />
<br />
Honestly, the best part about them is the relatively new Seiyuus that take up the roles of the 3 girls, because they are amazing, showcase their talents well and you can tell that they had absolute fun doing this, especially Hanako&#039;s VA with her constant screaming and whatnot. Simply nothing short of fantastic from all the characters here.<br />
<br />
Lerche is back at it once again for this series, and &quot;Who ya gonna call&quot;? Seiji Kishi, director for Angel Beats!, Tsuki ga Kirei, Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero, that&#039;s who! And wow oh wow, just like the big hitters he has, this sleeper, underrated series truly adds to his marvelous directing talent. And I really hands-down applaud studio Lerche this time because of how much insanity is done to propel this series forward, from the key visual PVs and the actual anime adaptation of the manga, it&#039;s like &quot;no time and talents were wasted here, not even the slightest&quot;! In my initial review, I&#039;ve called out the moe-CGDCT aethestics because of the resemblance, but look how far we have come: Only the watercolour art style followed through with the oh-so-funny facial scenes of the characters.<br />
<br />
Another area where I will NOT expect to be turned-on so nicely is the music, particularly the OST, which is the main joker aesthetic.<br />
&quot;Anime is saved (YET again)!&quot; - Pipimi, Pop Team Epic. Why the reference thou? Because every episode starts out with the cute and sweet moe OP, letting you know the characters and how they are like on the surface. THAT IS HEAVEN, expectations run wild. By the time the episode starts, and you&#039;ve been through the insane absurdity, you&#039;re NOT spared yet! The God-tier Pop Team Epic reminiscent ED rocks on you the reality, the harshness of it all with the full metalcore vibe. Now THAT IS HELL! Couldn&#039;t have asked for a better OST, and one that has surpassed expectations this season, and tuned in from the beginning to the end, never skipping both the OP and ED gives you the full mindf-ing experience.<br />
<br />
Asobi Asobase is a wholesome experience not to be missed, its God-tier levels of trickery will mock you hard and bad if you&#039;re not prepared for what lies ahead. I&#039;m really glad that I didn&#039;t skimp myself out on this masterpiece of a comedy, how shallow the series is, was never once a complaint when you&#039;ve been damaged this much. Easily the biggest surprise of Summer 2018, and it will confront you all-out on its full comedic-gag force!

    At first, I thought this anime will be your typical girl show with no comedic element whatsover. Why did I expected that? The opening. Openings are always the one that summarizes the plot or the composition of the story of an anime. And I was definetely wrong. I actually asked myself &quot;Am I watching this on YouTube right now?&quot; because I got clickbaited really hard.... and I love it. Comedy anime will always be there this season. It is a rule already on the anime industry that at least 1 comedy show will be a talk on the anime community. One of them this season

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289758">
        is &quot;Asobi Asobase&quot;. <br />
<br />
Story<br />
The plot is not really chronological as each episode is divided by &quot;content&quot; or &quot;parts&quot;. This is no issue for comedy shows for the past years as long as it makes the audience laugh out loud. The plot revolves on three stupid but laughable girls named Honda, Hanako (the unbelievably smartest one in academics but idiotic as hell), Olivia (that girl who looks like she mastered English through genetics but mastered Japanese instead), and Nomura Kasumi (The girl that has glasses... and... the one that has the serious face. sometimes). We watch this girl meet each other with misunderstood expectations, thus making the &quot;Pastimers Club&quot; where they engage each other with games... to pass time... (nice logic)... In the Pastimers Club room, we always see them sitting together, thinking of absurd activities to do from playing in an inflatable pool to playing a penalty-ridden game of sugoroku. Of course on every clubs there are chances other clubs will come by and have some absurdity (well in anime only...i bet) to one another. The Occult Club for example with Oka (the girl with the weird eyes and witch hat) had visited the Pastimers Club for some instance, as well as fights for the club room like the Shogi Club. Not to mention the involvement of supporting characters like the Student Council President, Maeda, Chisato Higuchi (club advisor), Olivia&#039;s weeb bro, Tsugumi Aozora and many more becomes part of the story&#039;s hilarity and madness with each contributing their characteristics to the story making it funny.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
The people/characters of an anime will always contribute to the plot&#039;s aim either to make us excited, laugh, thrill or horrify. Asobi Asobase have a wide range of well-done characters, each contributing to the show&#039;s aim... which is to be comedic. We have the three main girls of the series. Honda, Hanako, who is the genius as well as the idiot of the group who hates popular girls and such. Oliva, the blonde-hair girl who you think will be part of the cool kids/popular kids group but it turns out she is faking her accent and english and she&#039;s just your typical japanese girl. Nomura Kasumi, the only girl in the group that has glasses and probably the most dangerous one as her face gets serious, you are done. But on the other side she writes BL/yaoi novels making this her primary embarassment. These three makes the show very enjoyable. Let us not forget the supporting characters as well. The two teachers, the club advisor and the male teacher have both made some scenes funny. Tsugumi Aozora, whose gender still unknown picked curiosity to the Pastimers and so on some episodes, she was the focus. The Occult Club member Oka having a thrilling and mysterious atmosphere makes the vibe even stronger. Olivia&#039;s otaku bro who we thought that will be a handsome looking guy but it turns out it is your typical fat weebo (except his damn eyes were a beauty) and let us not forget Maeda. Maeda the best butler at the service of Honda Hanako that have anal issues.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Ahhh the sound.. The Opening song&#039;s soothing, cheerful and playful music &quot;really&quot; introduces us what are we going to expect on the series. Actually, no it doesn&#039;t. I love how they made us think that this will just be your typical high-school girl anime because of the opening song but then we stumble to realize how clueless we are as we watch and then we hear the Ending song, instead of having those angel-like voices, it was replaced by demons now and I love it.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
When I first look upon the visuals (like when I saw the first episode with the opening), I thought &quot;Oh no.. The art is... not that good i guess?.&quot; but as I progress through the episodes, I didn&#039;t think of the visuals at all anymore. In fact, the visuals are okay on normal scenes but when the &quot;shock&quot; or &quot;anger&quot; scenes come, we can see how the art changed drastically going higher levels. Not to mention the Opening&#039;s heavenly-like visuals was damn false as we go through the episode and then we get a pitch black ED with some line drawings of the three girls. Visuals matches the anime perfectly along with the sound.<br />
<br />
Overall thoughts and Enjoyment:<br />
I can&#039;t describe how much I enjoyed this series. There is no episode that wil make me giggle or make me laugh so hard. Overall, this anime is highly recommended for those who love the comedy genre like I do. And this is the type of anime that when you have a bad day, you can watch this and just laugh your heart out.

    Surrealistic slice of life comedy series centering around high school girls who act and play like children. When I heard what this series is about, I expected 2 pure 4 this world type of comedy that relies on the imagination of a child. What a blessing, I thought. I could have been more wrong, but not by much.<br />
<br />
The actual surrealistic side of this anime is entirely limited to the facial expressions of our characters. These vary from goofy cartoon physics to coaxedintoasnafu-tier memes that are about exactly as accurate and fresh as the third season of Rick and Morty. Only thing missing are surprise dickbutts

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285046">
        and picklewhomever. I was around 11 minutes and 27 seconds into episode one when this started to get old.<br />
<br />
The cast is entirely comedic, and for that reason, the series appears extremely flat and one-dimensional. Thus far, there is practically nothing we know about our characters outside the few obvious remarks that could have been read on MAL if someone had bothered to write them one --or even half--sentence long biographies.<br />
<br />
The writing is simply said content-lacking. The events are practically Lucky Star where they removed the moeblobs and put these girls with metamorphing faces to fill the slot. This time Konata, age 17, is not learning how to eat food, instead, it is trio of equally retarded girls do equally boring things in equally boring way. <br />
<br />
There are two things worth of anything. The scene where mr headmaster entered room and tasted high school girl&#039;s pee, as it confirmed that this series, is indeed, not going to be any better, and the ED song as it is wholesome and very fitting to the series. <br />
<br />
When it comes to enjoyment, if you are laughing at this, congratulations. You have done something which I haven&#039;t been able to do. I nearly cracked a smile when I wrote the Rick and Morty insult few paragraphs up. The series didn&#039;t manage to give me even that. Nichijou was one hella amazing show, but it was nothing like this one.

    I like to think of this show as PopTeam Epic but good. <br />
<br />
I honestly find this funny with very little in the way of complaints. <br />
<br />
I honestly adore Olivia&#039;s design. I like her personality and that character model. Even the voice actor fits so well. I also like that she isn&#039;t dumb like you see a lot with her characters. I&#039;d love to see her more in other shows or even characters like her. For some reason, I kind of feel disappointed that she doesn&#039;t know any English or has ever been to America. I do want to see her mother and what she&#039;s like.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285052">
        From what little Yuri themes are in this, I ship it.<br />
<br />
The animation is surprisingly good. It really fits with the comedy. Always expecting to see some Slice of Life story but you get this.<br />
<br />
The intro and outro I feel deserve some praise. The Intro shows this calming and adorable scene ( There is a kind of funny part where Olivia suddenly turns to the camera) It&#039;s what you expect for Slice Of Life stories. But the Outro is the complete opposite of it being Heavy Metal with weird visuals. It&#039;s a really good contrast.

    [THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS]<br />
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––<br />
<br />
(This is Not Your Normal Cute Girls Doing Cute Things [CGDCT])<br />
<br />
Before, I begin this review, I just want to state that ‘Asobi Asobase–Workshop of Fun’ is one of the best comedies of Summer 2018 and anybody looking for an outrageous, wacky, and absurd comedy should consider watching this series.<br />
<br />
Looking at the promo art, or its thumbnail, one would assume that this series is your typical CGDCT. And, you would be correct, for the opening song only, and then episode one begins and we, immediately, watch Hanako getting slapped in the face by Olivia. That is definitely not CGDCT material, far from it;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289762">
        so, in other words, the promo art and opening song were a goddamn bait-and-switch. And it worked. What transpires is an outrageous and absurd comedy with a cast of characters that make exaggerated facial expressions, and perform ridiculous and hilarious antics. And what a ride it will be.<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
<br />
There is “no story” per se, but rather a collection of shorts, roughly three to four, crammed into each episode. However, many tiny details about our main characters, e.g., Olivia having terrible B.O., Kasumi being awful in English Literature, and Hanako being really smart in school yet acts like a dumbass, and what they have done, e.g., the rock-paper-scissors game, the shoe launching battle, and determining if Aozora has a penis or not, are referenced and revisited in later episodes.<br />
<br />
The real purpose of these shorts is to demonstrate the dynamic chemistry between our three main characters. This is illustrated by their quick-paced and sharp timing of jokes, their ridiculous and hilarious antics, and finally, their inventive ways to set-up a joke and deliver a perfect punchline. There are, of course, many offensive and cruel jokes, such as homophobia, sexual harassment, and some xenophobia, but that’s to be expected in a comedy series such as this.<br />
<br />
Other notable things about this series: throughout the series, many pop culture references could be heard or seen, such as Detective Conan, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Pokemon Go, Dragon Ball Z, et cetera. And finally, some episodes will contain next-episode previews that are violently performed with hand puppets.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION:<br />
<br />
While, the animations and character designs are adequate and nothing to write home about, its art style, on the other hand, is amazing. The series usual boasts light pastel colors with detailed background designs, mirroring typical CGDCT series. Other times, it will feature dark colors with shadowy eyes and distorted faces set to a bleak background, mirroring typical horror series.<br />
<br />
But, even better than its art style are the numerous facial expressions that the characters exhibit. In the opening song and in some scenes, the girls will appear cute and innocent, but that doesn’t last long. These girls will make the most exaggerated and distorted facial expressions I’ve ever seen, expressing a wide range of emotions not typically seen in a CGDCT series, such as grimace, distress, shock, anger, disgust, boredom, smugness, and surprise. There were also many moments where the character’s facial expressions alone made me laugh for a good solid minute, and any series that is able to make me do that gets an ‘A+’ in my book.<br />
 <br />
SOUND:<br />
<br />
The sound design is one of ‘Asobi Asobase–Workshop of Fun’s’ greatest strengths. From its excellent voice acting to its ironic background music moments to its misleading opening song and its stark contrasting heavy metal ending song, everything fits together and has a purpose. <br />
<br />
The opening song is your typical J-Pop that features soft and calming vocals from our voice actresses with pianos and drums to accompany it, while the visuals depicts our main characters as heartfelt, gracious, and pure while wearing white clothing, set to a flowery background. This is intentional and is trying to lure us, the viewers, into believing that this series is your typical CGDCT series.<br />
<br />
And upon finishing any episode, the viewers are treated to a heavy metal ending song that features high pitched hollering and cries, unpleasant lyrics, and lots of fast-paced drumming and guitar strumming, while the chalky visuals depict our main characters looking angry and yelling. This reflects what the series is really about – a bunch of girls acting not so cute and not doing cute things.<br />
<br />
And finally, our voice actresses, whose careers are just starting, are doing an amazing and excellent job at bring our main characters to life. Hanako’s voice actress, Hina Kino, desires a special mention, as her performances, i.e., able to change voices/tones, yell, scream, shriek, etc, all within the same episode, has been astonishing from the very beginning of episode 1.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS:<br />
<br />
The main focus of this series revolves around our three main characters: Hanako Honda, Kasumi Nomura, and Olivia. They each possess unique and fascinating personalities that work seamlessly together; in fact, without these three main characters we would not have this series in the first place.<br />
<br />
- Hanako Honda, voiced by Hina Kino, is a hyperactive and hardworking girl, who excels in sports and in her studies. However, she lack common sense, often having ridiculous thoughts and suggesting crazy antics, and is jealous of the normies and popular kids. She is also rich and has a butler named Maeda.<br />
- Kasumi Nomura, voiced by Konomi Kohara, is a girl who appears to be quiet and studious, but is actually struggling in English. She is completely obsessed with trying to learn English that it becomes somewhat creepy and disturbing. She also likes to write BL fiction.<br />
- Olivia, voiced by Rika Nagae, is a blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl who appears to be non-Japanese and knows English, but is actually terrible in it and is really born in Japan; In fact, she can hardly speak a word of English. She also has a massive B.O. problem, which is a running joke in the series.<br />
<br />
More impressively is how these characters break the stereotypical/trope model of many previous anime series, and exaggerates them for greater comedy effect. It should also be noted that all three of our main characters can be mean-spirited and cruel in their own ways, and is expressed on their faces, still they manage to even that mean-spiritedness with some kindhearted gestures.<br />
<br />
There are, of course, many secondary characters, such as the Student Council President, Chisato Higuchi, and Maeda, that play a crucial role in furthering the comedy in this series. And they, themselves, have a unique and interesting personality, instead of being a one-or two dimensional character.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT:<br />
 <br />
Most people know that comedy and humor are subjective; some people may laugh at the jokes and skits, and others may not even crack a smile. In this case, I laughed and smiled a lot. I laughed at even the most offensive and downright cruel jokes. I enjoyed the characters with their exaggerated facial expressions and their mean-spirited yet warm personalities. I enjoyed watching their ridiculous and hilarious antics. And finally, I enjoyed listening to Hanako’s voice actress yelling and screaming like a madman, and the Babymetal-esque ending song is just perfect for this series. Overall, a very funny and enjoyable series.

    If I told you Summer 2018 was lacking in comedy shows, then that statement itself would sound like a joke. There were several ones including an anime that dealt with gender bender idols, a show that made every journey to school look like a misadventure, and even one with a demon girl dealing violent dropkicks. It wasn’t easy to stand out as much when it comes to comedy. Yet somehow, some way, we have Asobi Asobase that came along like a God-sent gift.<br />
<br />
Diving myself into this series felt like entering a world of absolute absurdity. Asobi Asobase is like a deconstruction of the ‘cute girls

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289760">
        doing cute things’ at its finest. And I say this as someone who really enjoy slice of life anime. There’s no complex storytelling and a show like Asobi Asobase knew what it was doing from the very start. <br />

Right off the bat, we are introduced to the trio of main cast – Hanako Honda, Olivia, and Kasumi Nomura. They make up the heart and soul of this show as every episode deals with their daily live adventures. Together, they are the Pastimers Club. As the most energetic girl of the group, Hanako often gets her classmates into playing games at school. These games often ends up being formulated with outrageous rules and ideas. Her classmate Olivia pretends to be an American with broken Japanese in order to fit with the crowd. Finally, Kasumi is the studious girl in the show with a dislike of playing games. With such an oddball cast, you’d wonder how this show can connect with the audience. Well, stop. Don’t think hard about this show because if you do, then there won’t be enjoyment coming from it. Asobi Asobase’s key to selling itself is the absurd humor. Nothing will probably ever make sense in the end and it doesn’t need to be. The games that these girls participate in often have high stakes too such as the loser being having to lick armpits. While this sets up for anticipating who the victor or loser will be, the sheer thrill of getting to the outcome always end up in an outrageously humorous manner. <br />
<br />
The main trio does indeed carry most of the show but some of the supporting cast also gets their own moments of fame. Characters like Chisato Higuchi makes a fool of herself despite being a teacher. Oka adds her own taste to occult games to bring out this show’s black comedy. Characters like Tsugumi Azora become a source of feminine jokes because of her appearance. On the contrary, the show also loves to make fun of masculinity with characters like Takayanagi. If you don’t believe me, just look at her face and tell me if she is manly or not. We even have a butler in the show by the name of Maeda who would do anything for Hanako. As you may guess, it leads to hilarious moments like when he shoots beams from his butt. There’s actually more on that list but the general idea is that Asobi Asobase doesn’t care about whether it makes sense or not. It cares about being entertaining. <br />
<br />
By the time you read up to here, the general consensus is probably just accept this for what it is or not. It’s an easy decision as the show isn’t hiding its intentions from the moment the girls appeared on screen. I’m not going to lie though, there are definitely some episodes that stands out more than others. However, each episode contains multiple segments where at least one stands out more than the rest. In some cases, you may end up liking them all equally or hate them altogether. There’s also so many jokes in this show that ranges from many categories to the point where you may think everything may be a parody. Believe it or not, it’s more about making its viewers laugh rather than looking for attention. <br />
<br />
What also did catch my attention is the character expressions. Watching Asobi Asobase is like the show literally challenging you to laugh at how characters react. The way characters show their expressions is often exaggerated at very chance it gets. It never takes a step back to showcase how mean the characters can be. Add to their hyperactive personalities and you get absurd humor. As such, praise should definitely be given to studio Lerche for drawing that out. The artwork is also mostly soft with palette coloring. Yet, it’s never hard to take eyes off the Pastimer Club as they stand out above all else that’s going on in every scene. Character designs in the show is delicate with the main cast as teenage girls. Others such as Oka and Takayanagi stand out with their own unique appearances. <br />
<br />
Quite frankly, character voicing in the show should also be given exception praise. Every dialogue in the show coming from the main characters sounds like a shtick. It’s almost if the characters are part of a stage performance. The theme songs are also performed by the main characters where every lyric can easily catch your attention. As gimmicky as everything sounds, I have no shadow of a doubt that the show knew what it was doing all along.<br />
<br />
Asobi Asobase takes the risk of bringing comedy to levels of being near incomprehensible. It’s much more about “cute girls doing cute things” to what you’re used to. However, be aware. This is definitely not an anime for everyone. If this style of anime selling is not your cup of tea, then definitely turn your head and walk away. But if you’re here to stay, then it’s a showstopper that gives absurdity a new meaning.

    Overview:<br />
<br />
Hoo boy, this review might be a little controversial with some of my MAL friends. We all know how subjective comedy is and how we all find different things funny. I heard glowing reviews about this anime, but the jokes just really weren&#039;t working for me. <br />
<br />
Humor Style:<br />
<br />
Do you have young kids in your family? Have you ever watched Teen Titans Go? Asobi Asobase uses a very similar approach to its humor and episodes, only in my opinion its slightly less funny. For example, characters will constantly make stupid faces and that&#039;s the joke. Characters will reference popular things, and that&#039;s the entire joke. There&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304117">
        an episode devoted to bad online yaoi fanfics and that&#039;s probably the best episode. The rich girl&#039;s butler is probably the best character just from his line delivery. His character&#039;s quirk is that alien&#039;s gave him an anal probe and now he fires lasers out of his ass. That&#039;s the level of intellectual humor we&#039;re working with. Another episode involves the girls getting into a contest to smell each other&#039;s armpits. The foreign girl wins because East Asians have less apocrine sweat glands and produce less body odor. You see kids, that&#039;s because East Asians usually have the AA allele of the ABCC11 gene that produces apocrine sweatglands. The AA allele is a mutation that makes the gene non-fuctional, so not as many apocrine sweat glands form. Most humans have the GA or GG alleles, so they produce more body odor. Those alleles were selected for in most of the world because body odor acts as an aphrodisiac for primates like us. Scientists believe the smelly alleles were not selected for in East Asians and Native Americans likely due to the cold climate of 20,000-10,000 years ago nullifying the advantage of smelling bad. The whole joke is that the episode is wasting your time teaching you about something you probably don&#039;t care about. It&#039;s the mortgage and real estate episode of Teen Titans Go!!! Same joke, same technique.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
There are 3 main girls that make up the pastime club. The first is Hanako, who is rich and stupid. That&#039;s her character. The second is Kasumi, who is a geek girl that dislikes games because her older sister always beat her at games. The final girl is Olivia, who was born in Japan to American parents. She pretends to speak English and acts like she can&#039;t speak Japanese, but she actually can only speak Japanese. That&#039;s the ENTIRE joke with her character. Every episode basically just uses variations of that joke.<br />
<br />
Plot:<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a show about nothing happening except 3 shallow characters hang out and do dumb gags. Occasionally they troll the audience and waste our time. Once again, kind of reminds me of this other cartoon I know.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
<br />
Studio Lerch used all their budget on Assassination Classroom, so this was made with whatever spare change they had left over.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
If you thought this show was hilarious, that&#039;s totally cool. I have shit taste in comedy and I&#039;m in no position to cast judgment on anyone. I recently watched an anime called &quot;Miss Bernard Said&quot;, which as of this review is rated at 6.02 here on MAL. Everyone here on MAL hates that series and thinks it&#039;s less funny than a brain tumor. I personally thought Miss Bernard was utterly hilarious. It&#039;s a simple show about a girl named Sawako who wants to impress people with how intelligent and cultured she is, but she&#039;s too lazy to actually read novels or watch art films. She just constantly brags about stuff she didn&#039;t actually read and is a pseudo-intellectual snob. I found it funny because I used to be a Sawako in Middle School. I think most people at some point have gone through a Sawako phase and that familiarity makes it funny. At least to me. If you&#039;re in the mood for a particular brand of VERY goofy humor, I can see why this show would be appealing. Personally though, I can&#039;t really recommend it easily.<br />

    One dimensional cardboard characters, plain bad looking art style and jokes that aren&#039;t funny in any way, there&#039;s the essence Asobi Asobase. The comedy is mostly build around either characters doing or saying something completely random and unexpected or character having a weird over the top facial expression. After seeing first 10 minutes I had already seen all this show had to offer. I still went and watched every episode trying to confirm there weren&#039;t any good jokes in the show, there were not. Confirming this wasted about 6 hours of my time though, so I guess joke&#039;s on me. <br />
<br />
A good situational comedy would

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294289">
        have build ups leading to a punchline, Asobi Asobase doesn&#039;t. Just constantly spewing bad memes one after another isn&#039;t what I could call funny or entertaining. Characters themselves are so simple and bad it would admittedly be hard to do anything more verbal that that with a cast like this.  <br />
<br />
This show really gave me nothing, except an huge overload of obnoxiousness. Nichijou does everything this show tries to do on a whole another level.  <br />

    You know the humor is dead when Asobi Asobase is everyone&#039;s definition of a &quot;Comedy&quot; Anime. <br />
This is just... I tried to enjoy it but Goddamm this was just so bad. <br />
<br />
&gt;The jokes felt forced like they were trying too hard. In result it turned out everything but funny. <br />
<br />
&gt;Relying too much on weird faces which at times felt way too weird and out of place. <br />
You see weird faces can be funny too if executed perfectly. Prime example would be Grand Blue and maybe even Great Teacher Onizuka. <br />
<br />
&gt;Voice Acting was full of cringe. I am sorry but the voices in this show was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354399">
        really bad. Want to know what a Good voice acting is like when comes to comedy genre? Watch Disastrous life of Saiki.K. Voice acting in that show is absolutely gold and fits perfectly with characters and moments. <br />
Here it was just a bunch of weird ass screams. <br />
<br />
&gt;Depends too much on vular jokes. <br />
OK Vulgar jokes are somewhat fun and can be extremely hilarious. Look at Detroit Metal City for example. That show depenes solely on vulgar jokes but My God it was hilarious. <br />
Here? Well, not so much. That epsiode where they talked about position or whatever and Hanako&#039;s butler&#039;s story were downright BAD. <br />
<br />
At this point, the rating 2 is me being generous

    Asobi Asobase represents why anime comedy is pretty damn special: because it can reach limitless possibility without betraying the sense of normalcy.<br />
<br />
What I&#039;m trying to say is: Asobi Asobase is funny as hell.<br />
<br />
First of all, do not be fooled by the cover art/poster of the series. In fact, the Shoujo-ness of the poster simply represents the irony that is about to unveil: a story about girls being girls in rawest ways imaginable. It is not to say that what we&#039;re dealing with is an Ecchi or blue comedy in vein of Seitokai Yakuindomo or Ao-chan Can&#039;t Study. In Asobi Asobase, everything that is wrong about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313773">
        being fifteen is celebrated to a fault: ranging from having odd sense of style, the guilt and pleasure of being a fujoshi, the dillema of being vulnerable and menacing all at the same time, and (I kid you not) body odors (yes, teenage girls are actually prone to this issue more than the boys). Nowadays, it is rare to find anyone throw the coin &quot;laugh-out-loud&quot; or &quot;LOL&quot; with the exception of what we type on our LINE chat. With Asobe Asobase, though, in each and every episode, you will literally laugh out loud. The major flaw, admittedly, is the art that is sometimes niche, but other times it can feel a bit &#039;meh&#039;.<br />
<br />
We laugh, and then we feel less alone. Being teenagers is uneasy and sometimes really gross but hey, sometimes we gotta laugh at ourselves.<br />

    Really enjoying it at the moment, specially after all the BL stuff, Laser implant and the character developments till the recent episode (episode 4) are all going nicely.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s genuinely a funny show and i can see it&#039;s rating going closer to 8 in the next couple of weeks.<br />
<br />
I Highly recommend it For those who haven&#039;t watched it yet.<br />
<br />
And I know there are many of you who are pointing out that there are a couple of more shows aired in the past similar to this.<br />
<br />
But i would recommend everyone to ignore that and watch the show to it&#039;s merit.

    Does Asobi Asobase (Workshop of Fun), or rather (Workshop of Doom) have anything of importance or is it funny to you? Fortunately for me it isn&#039;t. <br />
<br />
The &quot;Plot&quot; follows an absurd cycle of 3 school girls who play classic &quot;Primitives&quot; games, those from childhood of some, like: Board, Hands, etc... so far nothing funny. <br />
<br />
The comedian objective of this work focuses on these girls making &quot;grimaces&quot;, such painted faces, angry, sad and etc... rough faces to be exact. <br />
<br />
The author uses this as the &quot;comedy&quot; contained here, which to be honest is a huge lack of creativity. <br />
<br />
(Oh, and they scream A LOT) - another

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409693">
        kind of comedically rubbish comedy use out there these days - which pretty much defines the minds of human beings these days. <br />
<br />
A mistake besides the mentioned one is in not fulfilling the &quot;premise&quot;, not containing a focus only on games and grimaces, since after a third of the beginning of the work we are watching these young girls discovering sex, containing sexual themes, sexual acts and jokes sexual, meaningless to be included in a premise of this type and involving comedy (since for the more lucid, we know that sexual connotations are not funny but saturated these days). <br />
<br />
To make matters worse, we have pedophilic intentions, since Hanako&#039;s butler, Maeda, is an adult guy much older than the main ones and is basically a masochistic and fetishistic pedophile, capable of implying by non-explicit but intensionist actions, his pleasure in sniffing, licking or swallowing &quot;excrement&quot; (or whatever you prefer to think about) from these minors. <br />
<br />
The animation and design/art are ok, in keeping with what the premise would be. <br />
<br />
The sound doesn&#039;t exist, just screams, and the opening and closing got on my nerves as I alternated between the &quot;little girls&quot; and then showing the !@#$@!#$@. <br />
<br />
The direction and production did not exist, and if it did, it was absurdly rubbish as I remember it. <br />
<br />
The main characters Hanako, Olivia and Kasumi don&#039;t have any memorable characteristic points, they are unbearable and forgettable, besides their only existential purpose that remains is to satisfy the &quot;Sado-Maso-Fetichist Pedophiles&quot;, causing them erections by verbal, physical and sound. <br />
<br />
The rest of the cast is dry, monotonous, uncharacteristic, forgettable, insufferable and offensive, similar to the main ones. <br />
<br />
Finally, Asobi Asobase will forever be to me, UNFORGETTABLE, being one of the worst &quot;comedies&quot; I&#039;ve ever had the displeasure of absorbing with my eyes and mind, having absolutely NO POSITIVE POINTS, moreover, not being something simple and fleeting , but filled with content between actions and intentions TOTALLY Offensive, Demoralizing, Prejudiced, Pedophilic and Sexist. <br />
<br />
Never Recommend, Don&#039;t Recommend and Never Recommend this &quot;SHOW&quot; to anyone because of what I mentioned above, so just a warning: <br />
<br />
If you are on the good side and enjoy life and still want to live, even if you feel despicable and useless as a human being, but there is still something there that you like and suffer living to do that, even at this point, don&#039;t watch this &quot;SHOW&quot;, you will be just contaminating your brain with garbage and still wasting your time with something nonsense. <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading and see you next time.

    I expected this show to be a nice slice-of-life series because the opening provides three main girls with pretty dresses singing about friendship.  Then it quickly turns out to be a vicious comedy about the three main jealous schoolgirls who have brought some wacky, over-the-top sense of humor. Hilarious situations and rapid gags between the three main girls are what make this show so entertaining, and I am amazed by the direction and cleverness of the humor.  <br />
<br />
The main cast consists of three girls, and they are Hanako, Kasumi, and Olivia. Hanako is obsessed with being popular, Kasumi dislikes most fun things, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review382404">
        Olivia is an American that was raised in Japan and speaks very little English. Together with their teacher adviser, they form the Pastimer&#039;s Club, though what the club actually does is debatable. Most of their adventures take place in their club room, which I&#039;m surprised they haven&#039;t surmounted significant damage from their antics.<br />
<br />
The anime-style tends to jump from one style to another. One minute is a typical anime style, then the next one is an art reminiscent of horror anime, then it goes into another art style, and so on. Most of the episodes are done in skit fashion, jumping from one misadventure to another. Their adventures range from defending their club room from other usurping clubs that actually do things, to hi-jinks trying to figure out what to do that day. Most episodes end with a live-action puppet show, detailing some form of past time.<br />
<br />
The voice acting is incredibly well done, with Hina Kino being a standout of the show.  She&#039;s done phenomenally well as Hanako, and I&#039;m especially impressed by her distinct voice range.  Konomi Kahara and Rika Nagae have also done an exceptional job as Kasumi and Olivia as well, respectively, and they all have brought a lot of passion to their roles.  Asobi Asobase is one of the funniest comedy anime I&#039;ve ever watched, and I hope there could be season 2 of this show some time.

    ~Very minor spoilers contained for episode 4~<br />
<br />
What can I say? When I wrote the early review for this series, my thesis was &quot;this could be one of the funniest shows of the season or a complete disappointment.&quot; It&#039;s with regret that I have to say it seems to be the latter.<br />
<br />
The first episode is still incredibly funny, and I can&#039;t deny that. The novelty and surprise of the humor, the artwork, the offbeat pacing of the punchlines, and the sound/music were great for this type of over-the-top absurdist comedy, and fans of this type of humor (generally found more in Western animation) will surely agree.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285195">
        I had also made a prediction around episode 2 that the novelty could quickly wear off. Rather than focus on the unique humor the 3 girls&#039; interactions shown in episode 1, it could opt to rehash the same tired tropes we see in most gyaru-style humor, making their chemistry (or intentional lack thereof) a side-show instead. As of episode 4, it is now quite clear that this is the route the show is taking.<br />
<br />
Character chemistry is no longer the source of the punchlines at all. In fact, episode 4&#039;s only real instance of this (and the funniest part imo) was a game of hand wrestling. Apart from that, we got a sketchy butler, a promiscuous gyaru, a trap joke, a fujoshi joke (pardon me, an entire chapter dedicated to this), a middle-aged female teacher who can&#039;t get laid joke... heck, they had at least SOME opportunity for a new and different development when the teacher&#039;s friend said she&#039;d hook her up with someone and that someone ended up being a girl, but that wasn&#039;t even touched on. Instead it turned into a &quot;Honda&#039;s popularity crisis&quot; joke, which was funny at first, but has been  shamelessly rehashed every episode. The writing has shifted drastically from &quot;girls&#039; hilarious interactions in school&quot; to &quot;bad-girl trope-fest&quot;, to its detriment.<br />
<br />
Still, the series is by no means awful. It still has its share of chuckles and the initial episode was just great, if a bit misleading. If you love over-the-top absurdist humor and gyaru humor and think you&#039;d enjoy it for 12 episodes, I do recommend checking it out for yourself to make your own judgment. However, for anyone who is interested in something innovative in this sphere of anime comedy, well, this is no Nichijou. <br />
<br />
In short, Asobi Asobase has some interesting ideas and began with a relatively novel take on anime comedy, but it ultimately falls flat on old tropes and the novelty outstays its welcome, quickly becoming tired. 6/10

    A comic work of art and best anime of the season, if not of the year, would be the least I can say to describe Asobi Asobase. The anime manages to show its strengths from the very beginning that I had already decided to give it a 10 after only the first episode which had me crying of laughter.<br />
<br />
Each episode comprises of 4 parts during which we follow this squad of three middle schoolers and their adventures if so you wish to call it. Each girl has her own characteristic traits which are unique to her and the more you discover about the characters, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287176">
        more hilarious this anime gets.<br />
<br />
Asobi Asobase is designed mainly for the purpose of comedy and towards that end it shines brilliantly. Not long did it take me before I made up my mind to have it among my top comedy recommendations and for it to replace Hinamatsuri as my top pick this year.<br />
<br />
Now let’s go in detail at the art of Asobi Asobase<br />
<br />
Story: As mentioned, the story mainly revolves around the three middle schoolers and expands the premise and their surroundings as it progresses. They mainly spend their time playing simple games such as thumb wars, for instance, which develop exponentially into crazy settings. But the anime isn’t limited to this and as more characters are introduced, the horizons it encompasses continue to grow without lacking in quality. Think of something like Nichibros and you’ll have a fairly good idea of what to expect. <br />
<br />
Art: For any comedy to be a success, artistic talent is mandatory. And for that regard, Asobi Asobase doesn’t fall short. It features an adaptive art style which changes accordingly depending on the needs of the setting and is certainly one to remember. The girls look cute when needed, they look distorted when needed and are adorable all through.<br />
<br />
Sound: Another aspect that was mastered here. The opening plays a tricky part in showing you this as a common CGDCT anime and then you are presented with material that contradicts the expected, but as you watch it and get to know more about the characters, in a comically breathtaking way, certain beauty starts to arise in the op making it as cute as intended to be. The ED is another thing worth noting, but I’ll leave that for you to find out. Nothing here felt out of place, be it the VAs whose job mostly involved screaming, the themes of the scenes or the execution. It all worked in a harmonious manner delivering the best Asobi experience possible.<br />
<br />
Character development: Despite what I say about how this anime is mainly for laughs, there still is character development going in-between and during these scenes. We get to know more about the girls with each episode and their peculiar personalities that still retain their cuteness. For some reason, the characters take so short a time before I take a liking to them and feel like I know them well after just one appearance or two. This may be thanks to their personalities being simple yet entertaining, peculiar yet likable and the balancing between said traits is what makes each of them unique.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Not much can be said here more than denoting the fact that this is the most enjoyable title this season without competition. It continues to astound me the more I watch it and never ceases to excel in all that it presents. If what you are looking for is a comedy anime then you have certainly come to the right place and are in for a treat as Asobi Asobase might just be the greatest find you’ll make.<br />
<br />
If for any reason you find yourself reluctant to start this show, I urge you to at least try the first episode. Usually it takes me 4 episodes to accurately assess an anime, but in this particular case, as I have already mentioned, you can decide if this is the right anime for you after just the first one.<br />

    Asobi Asobase is the best comedy anime I have seen this year or at least it&#039;s in my top 3, the anime tricks you at the start into thinking this was going to be a Yuri or Moe with some drama type of anime by making the opening song and character design look as cute and beautiful as possible as well as adding a hint about some drama in the first few minutes of the anime. The anime then used the element of surprise to present an amazing, very funny and unique anime.<br />
<br />
The anime&#039;s strongest point is the comedy, you would think that because of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289771">
        how cute the girls are designed and how it all seems so calm and peaceful that it would be the wholesome type of comedy (if that made any sense) like the type we see in the Usagi Drops anime but fortunately that&#039;s not the case, the anime isn&#039;t afraid of making any types of jokes, you would find scenes where the characters&#039; overreactions are so perfect that it makes the situatino much better, you would also find the awkward, random, disgusting and over the top comedy parts with the normal jokes being presented almost perfectly every time either by having the punchline at the perfect time or the whole scene itself being presented in a very great unique way which is the reason that made the comedy in this anime shine.<br />
<br />
While the writing was a very big reason of why the anime is as great as it is, the Voice actors played a very big part in that. Not a single voice actor felt out of place or performed badly, they all with no exceptions fit the characters they voice perfectly, you could feel how much work the voice actors put in the anime and you could only imagine how many times they had to redo the same parts to make the characters feel as alive and genuine as they appear in the anime.<br />
<br />
The voice actors, the art, the writing, the way the anime was presented at first and the great way it continued on afterwards were the reasons the anime turned out to be so great, The anime is extremely Enjoyable. <br />
<br />
Overall I would give the anime a 9/10, there were very few scenes where the comedy wasn&#039;t as good as the usual but that was like once or twice so I would still give it a 9. <br />
<br />
<br />
Would recommend it to anyone that likes comedy in general. <br />
<br />

    This show is very funny, at least for 90% of the first episode.<br />
<br />
Then the TLDR is just &quot;gross&quot;.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not just bad, it&#039;s butt-jokes-on-episode-4 bad. Dirty jokes, body odor with a hint of racism (Japanese people don&#039;t smell so bad as American), funny faces, then the same faces, then no-longer-funny faces again. Loud voices, kamasutra with dolls, and no connection to the main theme of the first episode: typical Japanese pastimes.<br />
<br />
No plot whatsoever. No character development. No background. Complete lack of interesting contents.<br />
<br />
But... it wouldn&#039;t be that bad had the first episode not been so good. They had potential and completely wasted it. Yes, the humour

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396493">
        is a little forced and the voices and faces are just a little exaggerated, but it could have been funny.<br />
<br />
So, if you liked the first episode, and think this is a good surreal comedy show, then watch no further, otherwise you will end up writing a review like this.<br />
<br />
For me, this is te most disappointing anime ever. You could watch episode 1 thirteen times, and have a better experience than watching the whole series.

    This anime might look like your typical girl anime but it&#039;s not, this is the girl version of the anime Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou but with middle school girls. This reminiscent of the nostalgic memories of your school days which have your funny memories of it.<br />
<br />
The story is not complex, the three main characters Olivia, Honda, and Kasumi who met in an uncircumstantial way formed a club called the Pastime Club. They&#039;re a peculiar trio each with their own traits and gains, we see a number of other characters too who come into the lives of these three main characters. The story comprises several sketches

          <span style="display: none;" id="review378164">
        of different scenarios that take place around the main characters and their Club. There isn&#039;t a minute where these sketches are not funny, we see their daily lives in a most hysterical way.<br />
<br />
The sketches were damn funny, it wasn&#039;t forced and the atmosphere had a great comedic presence. The voice acting deserves high praise those were some of the best, opening and closing music are lovely and mental respectively, the directing was great. Really loved this.

    Daily lives of highschool girls AKA nichijou on crack 10/10<br />
<br />
Story lacks depth but makes up for it by high-quality and consistent stupidity and slapstick<br />
<br />
Low budget moebait art that I usually hate works so well here, since part of the enjoyment comes from being jebaited so hard<br />
<br />
Hina Kino is a demon goddess. You could remove all music and I&#039;d still rate sound 10/10 because Hina Kino on Hanako is good enough to be a standalone piece of art.<br />
<br />
Great deconstruction of CGDCT into Questionably Cute Girls Doing Stupid Shit (QCGDSS)<br />
<br />
Haven&#039;t enjoyed this level of mindless comedy since Saiki &amp; Nichijou. The only thing that threw me off

          <span style="display: none;" id="review299954">
        my enjoyment was the fact that there aren&#039;t any more episodes<br />
<br />
The fake s2 reference and the ending is like a big fuck you to viewers, but it is only then we will realize we actually don&#039;t mind being fucked like that.<br />
<br />
Please release more material, my weekly temporary depression cure

    If there&#039;s an anime that can beat nichijou in terms of comedy, than it&#039;s asobi asobase.<br />
<br />
The art was kinda a little bit offputing at first, but you&#039;ll get used to it at certain point.<br />
<br />
The comedy is just brilliant. this is the first anime that i know of, to put a &quot;shittyflute star spangled banner&quot; as a BGM.<br />
<br />
The character is so well done, and did i mention the voice acting ? some of them are still new to the industry but have such a great voice. Especially for Hanako Honda seiyuu.<br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s a great anime, and kinda underrated. hoping for a season 2 soon
