    The problem with sequels is that they&#039;re rarely as good as the original, any show that actually achieves the feat of surpassing the original appears only once in a blue moon. Given that fact, I will freely admit that I approached Aria: the Natural with a certain degree of trepidation, especially as the original series is a favourite of mine.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, all of my fears were removed in the gentlest manner possible.<br />
<br />
Aria: the Natural continues the tale of Neo Venezia in very much the same manner as the original, except for the fact that this series is twice as long. The story, once more, revolves around

          <span style="display: none;" id="review13254">
        Akari, Aika and Alice as they go through their daily lives in their &quot;quest&quot; to become undines. The episodic format of the original series is maintained throughout this one, and the show generally manages to achieve the same relaxed feeling of the original. However, Aria: The Natural has some moments that purists would define as &quot;off-kilter&quot; - a view I tend to disagree with.<br />
<br />
Let me explain. The first series was very much an introductory show, allowing the audience to familiarise themselves with Akari, Aika and Alice, as well as the other residents of Neo Venezia. The Natural, on the other hand, is an introduction to the world of Aqua itself, something which was alluded to in the final episode of the first series. Indeed, the role of cats in this series is much greater than before, and the quasi-supernatural element of the show, which was only lightly touched upon previously, is very much in force here.<br />
<br />
Because of this though, many people view The Natural as inferior to the original series, basing such judgement solely on the fact that this show has some genuinely creepy moments, as well as the fact that several episodes are based purely on supernatural events. In Aria: The Animation, the effect of the supernatural was toned down to maintain the relaxed feeling of the show, however The Natural pushes this aspect of Aqua firmly to the fore with the introduction of several elements - Cait Sith being the primary one.<br />
<br />
Art and animation for The Natural remains as superlative as the original, with some improvement given to some of the more &quot;fantastic&quot; plot elements. Character designs remain unchanged though (which will come as a relief to many fans), with each of the leads and the supporting roles being as visually charming as ever - even in Super Deformed mode. The panoramic views of the Neo Venezia remain very much in force, however these have been enhanced more because of the attention given to other areas of Aqua. The level of detail is actually better in The Natural because of the show&#039;s focus on the world of Aqua, and with that attention to detail comes a degree of personality (yes, I know it sounds weird saying that a world has personality - watch the show and see for yourself).<br />
<br />
Sound and music continue to be excellent, with the voice actors doing sterling work with their respective characters. The thematic music used throughout the series is very much in keeping with the style of the original series, and retains the same &quot;continental&quot; feeling as well. The sound effects are again, excellent and well choreographed, with nothing too overwhelming or too subtle. The OP and ED are calm and melodic, keeping the fluidly relaxed theme of both the original and this series.<br />
<br />
The characters are, again, a joy to watch, however some people may not follow this train of thought because of the supposed &quot;flaws&quot; in the show (i.e. the supernatural elements I mentioned earlier). Akari, Aika and Alice continue to be as charming and as innocent as ever, and while there may be a distinct lack of major development in this series, I didn&#039;t find this factor to hinder my appreciation of the characters in any way.<br />
<br />
The supporting characters continue to be by turns witty, soothing, stern, downright hilarious, etc, very much in keeping with the original series. However, many of the supporting cast tend to take more of a back seat in this series, with a greater amount of focus being given to Akari especially.<br />
<br />
Fans of the original series may not find that The Natural sits too well with them, especially given the fact that this show is less about the characters and more about the world they live in. That said, it continues to be a truly enjoyable series overall, and a truly relaxing one at that.<br />
<br />
Aria: The Natural, whilst maintaining everything that made the original series great, is actually a very different show, and I would judge it at least equal to The Animation in every aspect. Given the basis of The Natural, and its intorductory perspective on the world of Aqua, it&#039;s no surprise that fans recommend watching both series before watching Aria: The Origination.

    This is the first time that I have ever felt an anime deserves full marks in all categories. Aria the Natural had everything I could want in an anime. Here\&#039;s the breakdown...<br />
<br />
Story: The reason why the plot is so good is that each episode has a unique story and it never gets tiring despite not having a running story. Neo-Venezia is a place meant to be explored and that is what we get thorugh the series as Akari and Co. meat new people and grow. Watching something like this is relaxig and just puts a smile on your face.<br />
<br />
Animation: The world of Aria is absolutely

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405">
        beautiful. The town of Neo-Venezia is presented in such detail that it makes me wish that I was there. And the sceneries are a sight to see and in an anime like Aria, we get to see them in many aspects, whether it is in the morning, evening, night etc. The only thing i wish for is a HD version of Aria, but still gets full marks none the less.<br />
<br />
Sound: OP, ED, BGM, it\&#039;s absolutely incredible. The music fits in so well and is something that just relaxes you. Words alone cant describe how much i love this kind of music. It\&#039;s pure bliss~<br />
<br />
Character: This is perhaps the best aspect of Aria. Each character is not only unique but is extremely likable. There is a wide range of personalities yet they go so well together. And their chibi face form is hilarious. Each have there own style and goes well with their personality. <br />
<br />
Overall, to me, not only is this the best slice of life, it is the best anime out there. It is just perfect. While this type of anime is not for everyone, Aria the Natural was everything i could ask for. Hopefully you can see the magic of Aria like I did if you ever check this out and become a fan too.

    One expression: &quot;Embodiment of relaxing happiness&quot;.<br />
<br />
Welcome back to yet another season of Aria. Never heard of this anime before? To put it bluntly: this whole series marks the pinnacle of entrancing anime Slice of Life. <br />
<br />
To follow the anime chronologically, please watch &quot;Natural&quot; only after you’ve finished &quot;Animation&quot;, otherwise you might miss out on proper character and world introduction.<br />
<br />
Note: Alongside the actual review you will come across some diary entries written by our protagonist Akari in her usual cheerful way. Let them accompany you during your personal gondola travel throughout Neo Venezia as you read this humble examination.<br />
<br />
<br />
~~~~~ <br />
&quot;Dear Diary, how have you been so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review134303">
        far?<br />
You grew quite big, but that&#039;s not bizarre,<br />
since I experienced a WORLD last season.<br />
You know, so many tourists have come here<br />
to see Neo Venezia, it would appear<br />
the colonization of Mars had a bountiful reason.<br />
<br />
My own task hasn&#039;t changed during this time...<br />
and it isn&#039;t only to make this rhyme!<br />
I guide my gondola over the streams<br />
of water flowing through this peaceful place<br />
and relishing the friendly people, the slower pace.<br />
This life is more natural than your dearest dreams.&quot;<br />
~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Natural&quot; continues from where &quot;Animation&quot; has ended, and the premise appears as simple as ever: a bunch of cute girls rowing gondolas over the watery planet of Aqua (formerly known as Mars), experiencing countless everyday adventures. As one probably assumes: the plot stays calm and action-less, which may not appeal to everyone. Aria doesn&#039;t try to implement fast-paced scenes like all-in gondola races or natural catastrophes. Honestly though: this is by far the best possible outcome. So be prepared to indulge into pure relaxation...<br />
<br />
<br />
~~~~~<br />
&quot;Ha-hi, I&#039;ve become sleepy as of late - <br />
what can I do against this moony state?<br />
Maybe we&#039;ve overdone the star-gazing a bit.<br />
So today I let Alice and Aika do the rowing<br />
and meanwhile watched the floating islands glowing<br />
and dreamed of a yummy banana split.<br />
<br />
Especially the three great Water Fairies<br />
Akira, Athena and Alicia know what carries<br />
our beloved Aqua below its top surface.<br />
So even I learn about the deeper meaning of flowers,<br />
or how to spend the most memorable hours.<br />
Together we preserve the peace in grace.&quot;<br />
~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
Every remarkable anime needs an interesting and unforgettable cast of characters, and Aria definitely delivers. The plot focuses on three apprentice undines (undine is an equivalent of gondola tour guide) and their respective masters (widely known as the &quot;Three Water Fairies&quot;), belonging to three competing companies. Yes, although they&#039;re competitors on paper, you forget that this is Aria, so they train and even celebrate together, not letting any hostile thoughts build up during the entire show.<br />
<br />
The tendency for names to begin with &quot;A&quot; is quite obvious, and one might think that this will result in challenges distinguishing them from one another. Fortunately, these difficulties are immediately scotched because of diversified traits all of these young women have, both in appearance and manner of speaking. One&#039;s for certain: You will never forget their key expressions and special faces, so what else would you need for characters to become memorable?<br />
<br />
<br />
~~~~~<br />
&quot;Today reminded me of all my reliable friends:<br />
Alicia as my mentor doesn&#039;t miss a time and lends<br />
me her firm arm; oh this makes me so proud (:<br />
The practises together with Aika and Alice<br />
are by far the best method to maintain my inner peace.<br />
&quot;Embarrassing remarks aren&#039;t allowed!&quot;... Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhh?<br />
<br />
And then there&#039;s my companion for everywhere:<br />
President Aria, the cuddly cat, takes utmost care<br />
of me during my adventures, in every case.<br />
Dear Ai-chan is mailing with me everyday.<br />
That&#039;s important since the postman tends to say<br />
that any letter can overcome time and space.&quot;<br />
~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
Concerning the other inhabitants of Neo Venezia, a special mention has to be given to the cats. Not only do they provide even more heart-warming moments by constantly being around as &quot;presidents&quot; of their respective company, but they also maintain certain traditions to add to the mystery aspect of the world.<br />
<br />
Being Slice of Life, it&#039;s only natural for our undines to interact with all kinds of people during their daily work. Everyone tells their own story and fits perfectly into the whole setting. As soon as the viewer identifies themselves with the general mood, watching the characters is an utmost bliss. As trivial as some of the stories may seem, they all carry a deeper meaning, and overall, help to eternally carve the world of Aqua into one&#039;s memory.<br />
<br />
<br />
~~~~~<br />
&quot;Gliding Canal Grande under Rialto Bridge today,<br />
we met Akatsuki-san gathering roses for Boccolo day.<br />
He wants to see Alicia go &quot;ara ara&quot; again.<br />
Rumours say there&#039;s a woman in a black dress,<br />
connected to San Michele Island more or less.<br />
Yep, so much unfathomable wisdom there is to gain.<br />
<br />
Have you ever heard of Redentore before?<br />
The Wedding to the Sea or the golden oar?<br />
Maybe I should ask wise Grandma about all of them.<br />
Even the cats are keeping their traditions<br />
with mystic Cait Sith improving their conditions.<br />
Another detail in this as our world carved aquamarine gem.&quot;<br />
~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
Even if it&#039;s episodic, Aria&#039;s ability to tell profound and humane stories is virtually unmatched, especially concerning the Slice of Life genre. &quot;Aria the Natural&quot; succeeds both in surpassing its prequel through the sheer power of empathy and the preservation of its initial premise, yet always being special every episode.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, the style of the story telling may appear boring to anyone not accustomed to this kind of anime. Watching more than two episodes per day is not recommended, otherwise it will really be too much/too less for the viewer to consume. Neo Venezia and Aqua are generally places that should be frequented in short visits instead of long ones in order to completely admire their wonderful beauty. <br />
<br />
<br />
~~~~~<br />
&quot;In the morning we trained outside of town<br />
inside some quaint landscapes of high renown;<br />
you even could see Hope Hill from there.<br />
Every minute we practise is to master the water<br />
with its clear and calm nature, it&#039;s like a daughter<br />
I need to console and for whom I must care.<br />
<br />
Oh, this place&#039;s life is certainly unique.<br />
Everyone&#039;s moving so smoothly I tend to speak<br />
with them a lot about the city&#039;s style.<br />
The buildings, while modestly tinted, stand<br />
just short enough to see the sky so grand<br />
and let us sense a light sea breeze awhile.&quot;<br />
~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
Natural’s art and animation unquestionably serve their purpose.  The architecture of Neo Venezia with its detailed Italian touch and generally colourful drawing style make the town&#039;s visit aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. Being Aria, the overall manner of art isn&#039;t flashy but rather quaint, although special moments with spectacular light effects or noticeable water reflections aren&#039;t left out either.<br />
<br />
<br />
~~~~~<br />
&quot;Today I couldn&#039;t concentrate myself too much<br />
on discovering another unique Venezia touch.<br />
It was because my ears were dancing...<br />
dancing after hearing Athena-san&#039;s heavenly voice<br />
and feeling Makino Yui on San Marco Square rejoice.<br />
Music assists and quiets me down before advancing.<br />
<br />
After noon we three indulged in delicious coffee<br />
while bearing the sun looking like a giant toffee.<br />
I hope the heat won&#039;t cause any illusion.<br />
So we sat listening to some musicians<br />
playing their plucked instruments under arduous conditions -<br />
music-less this world would fall into seclusion.&quot;<br />
~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
Music-wise the general mood stays the same as in every other category: calm and relaxing, but always soulful. Smooth tones brought to our ears by plucked instruments with occasional mystical chants and lyrical insert songs.<br />
<br />
One aspect in which &quot;Aria the Natural&quot; surpasses other anime is the everlasting vigour of the opening with its song &quot;Euforia&quot; performed by Yui Makino. I&#039;m not exaggerating: This opening is the only one in all anime that I haven’t ever skipped; the impact is simply amazing.<br />
<br />
The seiyuus perform their assigned roles splendidly, and because of the previously mentioned main characters&#039; impressionable manner of speaking, they have a high chance of staying in the viewer’s mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
~~~~~<br />
&quot;The evening is wrapped by red warm tones<br />
which gently heal our hearts, our soul, our bones.<br />
I lie down on bed and take off my glove -<br />
this glove that isn&#039;t just protecting my hand,<br />
but also reminding me I have to understand:<br />
as Prima Undine I need more special traits I love.<br />
<br />
As a child I wanted to be a fairy<br />
flying around and make everyone merry;<br />
I reached this goal, without caring for a penny.<br />
All of these encounters here are the planet&#039;s bliss<br />

A picture is worth a thousand words, as the old proverb says. If you&#039;re already familiar with the prequel &quot;Animation&quot;, this sequel includes everything required to top your previous experience. To everyone who&#039;s new to Aria: This review is coming to an end, but your journey has just started and I hope that you have the necessary tools now to decide whether or not to give this outstanding anime a chance. Not to mention that its sequel &quot;Aria the Origination&quot; finishes the whole series in one of the most emotional ways I&#039;ve ever encountered in anime or any other medium before.<br />
<br />
Aria had captured my heart in no time... so why not yours too?<br />

    (This has been adapted from my reddit thread)<br />
<br />
It&#039;s strange to think about everything that has gone on in one&#039;s life to get to this specific moment. The people one has seen, the events one has experienced, and the magical moments one has witnessed all culminate into a single, solitary point in time. These various encounters seem miniscule and largely unrelated. But if one looks at the bigger picture, it&#039;s easy to see that these tiny dots form quite the beautiful image. Such is the case with Aria the Natural and most of what it has to offer.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Aria the Natural begins where its previous season, Aria

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181006">
        the Animation, left off. Akari, Aika, and Alice are still aspiring Undines, experiencing everything that Neo-Venezia, Aqua, and life throws their way.<br />
<br />
Aria the Natural follows quite well in its predecessor&#039;s wake. Calmness oozes from every corner of the show, and the girls&#039; escapades are mostly aimed at teaching and learning lessons that someone needs in order to become a well-rounded person. However, the mood actually deviates from this path on a semi-regular basis. It takes on creepy scenarios that test Akari&#039;s resolve, romantic scenes that expand Aika&#039;s emotions, and angry situations that reflect Alice&#039;s inner turmoil. Now, the changes in mood are not grand; they&#039;re as small as a gondola&#039;s displacement while rocking silently on the sea. But being able to see the show literally leave its comfort zone provided it with both interesting and unique outlooks.<br />
<br />
These outlooks aren&#039;t just standalone, though. The themes are, once again, quite general and applicable to most people. Meaning there is a lost sense of worth attached to many of them. Individually, these themes are simple, but hearkening back to the introduction, it&#039;s the entire scope that matters. For Aria the Natural, it kicks off with the idea of &quot;encounters&quot; and never lets up. Without fail, each episode binds its personal message with this over-arching motif. For countless examples: it&#039;s best not knowing everything in order to encounter new things, some encounters are better left alone, an encounter may last a lifetime or not at all, particular encounters can happen vicariously, etc. What it does incredibly well is getting across the notion that encounters are indescribable. There are so many variations, so many definitions, that it just isn&#039;t possible to sum up succinctly what one encounter entails. In Akari&#039;s words, an encounter is simply &quot;wonderful.&quot;<br />
<br />
It&#039;s best to think of Aria the Natural&#039;s themes as one of the buildings that populates Neo-Venezia. The foundation and pillars are the general ideas presented. While alone they just &quot;sit&quot; there, they fully support the roof, or overall theme, that rests atop them. And what one is left with is a structure that, no matter the season, remains steadfast and strong.<br />
<br />
Aria the Natual also continues the tradition of placing heavy emphasis on the world of Aqua. The exploration of the underground, information on Pair graduation, and the Redentore Festival are apt instances that further promote how rich and detailed the environment really is. And just like the mood and themes before it, Aria the Natural goes above and beyond once more by providing better balance. Aqua and Neo-Venezia remain a focal point, but more attention is given to the cast -- both main and side -- and to the fantastical nature of the setting itself.<br />
<br />
Going into the intricacies, the story still follows Akari, but actually gives the other characters a chance to &quot;strut their stuff.&quot; Aika and Alice get their own tales, and some of the side characters -- such as the mailman, Akatsuki, and even the townspeople -- get their own chance in the spotlight, providing the show with even more diversity. At the same time, Aria the Natural incorporates more of the supernatural. That is, among the realistic adventures being had are the dream-like ones. The &quot;fox&#039;s wedding,&quot; the looping canal, and the appearance of the spirit of the gondola boosts both the city&#039;s and the show&#039;s feeling of being otherworldly, something that is constantly alluded to. In short, by spreading out the story, and not strictly revolving it around Akari, this newfound balance elevates the anime that much further.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
<br />
Aria the Natural, as already discussed, loves to talk about its world. And if there is anything that it does more than describe it is show it to the audience. Once again, the art captivates: the beautiful scenery on the oceanfront, the Venetian statues and towers, the plazas and alleys; at this point, it feels less like the Italian version and more like the Aquan. On top of all this, the comedic faces for the whole gang are also back in full-force.<br />
<br />
The character designs, likewise, maintain their past-yet-future look. The girls, at certain points, do don more domestic drab, which was a nice change of pace. There are two notable occurrences of vastly different style changes, however. The lesser of the two is during the filler story, where the cast has their gender&#039;s swapped. The goal of making it seem unsettling worked, due in part to everyone&#039;s uncharacteristic male and female looks. The greater, and obviously most important, is Aika&#039;s hair. This will be talked about further ahead.<br />
<br />
The animation sees a bit of an increase this time around, if only because of the length of the season and because of the actions the characters take. In other words, Akari, Aika, and Alice do a lot more this time around besides sitting and standing. Walking, running, and jumping happen regularly, since the peaceful nature of the show is shaken up every now and again.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
The cast of Aria the Natural begin to shed their one-dimensional status and actually see some proper development over the course of the season.<br />
<br />
As the youngest of the trio, Alice actually comes off as the most mature. Her stoic demeanor and often quiet way of speaking makes her seem older than she is. While she is most often perceived as an adult, the struggles she faces are entirely childlike in nature. For Alice, she has extreme difficulty establishing relationships with other people. And this is a two-way street: it&#039;s giving and receiving the connections. Having the courage to socialize with others and understanding that not everything can be handled alone allowed her to grow into the person she always came off as being.<br />
<br />
Aika&#039;s problem was somewhat different, but still two-fold. As is often evident, she is quite outgoing when it comes to speaking and letting Akari and the gang know how she is feeling. But interestingly, while she uses her emotions, she did not fully comprehend what they entailed. That is, she wasn&#039;t able to understand herself. In the game of love, her feelings remained repressed because of her uncharacteristic lack of confidence. But a nighttime meteor shower, a few hair-clips, and a man named Al provided the self-esteem boost she required to see that her genuine love is nothing to be unabashed about.<br />
<br />
And Aika sees even further improvement in regards to herself. She had always wanted to be Alicia; copy her elegance, mannerisms, and beauty as best as she could. But following an unfortunate accident, she learns an incredibly powerful lesson; that one shouldn&#039;t try to replicate anyone else but one&#039;s self. It sounds cheesy, but it&#039;s true. You are your own person, and that means that the experiences, emotions, and events you encounter cannot be emulated again. Everyone is special, is unique, in their own way, and Aika discovers this in a somber yet heartfelt manner. And though the symbolism of cutting one&#039;s hair is common, it fits here perfectly; she transitioned from someone &quot;unknown&quot; to her and into the person that not Akira, not Akari, and even not Alicia could be: herself.<br />
<br />
Not to be outdone in development, Akari goes more philosophical. Known for her unending kindness and unparalleled optimism, this season tests her beliefs. What does this mean? Once again, there are two sides to investigate: facing both the real and the unreal. For the first time, Akari undergoes situations that aren&#039;t &quot;pretty.&quot; She senses fear, trepidation, anxiety, longing, seriousness; complete opposites to the personality that she normally boasts. This made her more human, more real, than she has ever been before. But ironically, it&#039;s the fake that reaffirms her that the world isn&#039;t just filled with these more degenerate feelings. Before, Akari&#039;s love toward the city was prominent. Now, it&#039;s the city&#039;s love toward Akari -- in the form of Cait Sith -- that takes center stage. It protects and guides her, letting her know full well that, despite the hardships that life may contain, her way of thinking and acting is something truly precious.<br />
<br />
For each girl -- Akari, Aika, and Alice -- they&#039;re development can be summarized as maturing. And each goes about it in different ways: Alice becomes an adult, Aika finds herself, and Akari is grounded to reality. This would not have been possible without the helping hand of their respective mentors, namely Alicia, Akira, and Athena. Besides merely complementing the girls, this season sees them being teachers not in the art of the Undine, but in this aforementioned maturity. Athena pushes and grabs Alice at just the right moments; Akira is the unyielding rock that forces Aika&#039;s hand; and Alicia acts as a mother, giving Akari the wisdom that only years of life experience could match. Now more than ever, the Three Great Water Fairies are more than just the greatest Primas of their age. They&#039;re symbolic gondolas, guiding their apprentices down the canal known as life.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
The OP follows in the character designs&#039; footsteps. That is, it embodies both an out-of-reach yet close vibe that makes one at ease whenever it is heard. The beautiful vocals, water-like sound effect, and simple beat in conjunction with the piano and violins really do make the piece euphoric.<br />
<br />
The ED lends itself well to avoiding the use of lyrics. The plain guitar, piano, and violin work together in a catchy manner, while simultaneously soothing the atmosphere. The piece isn&#039;t stellar like the OP or other parts of the OST, but it fits well enough.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is, once again, great. Like the ED, the dainty guitar, the soft piano, and varying violin playing meld as one, capturing not only the simple life, but one that fits Neo-Venezia to a tee. Especially so is the track with the slow-and-fast guitar-playing combined with various instruments. It&#039;s rising and falling notes create a piece that can be happy or sad to fit whatever situation needed.<br />
<br />
An issue that persists into this season, though, is the use of lyric-heavy tracks. During certain segments, the soundtrack uses pieces that are filled with vocals. The lyrics themselves are fine, but their use distracts the viewer and lessens the impact of those particular scenes.<br />
<br />
Voice-acting is above-average across the board. Ryou Hirohashi as Alice with her no-tone way of talking, Junko Minagawa as Akira with her stern yet soft voice, and Chiwa Saito as Aika with her girly and funny way of speaking perform wonderfully. And this applies to every woman involved, too; all-around great job.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
What I always found fascinating was the show&#039;s ability to use the same tactics to get a laugh out of me. The first season did this as well, but it still never feels repetitive. In fact, it was a game for me, trying to correctly guess when Aika would shout her famous phrase or when Alicia would softly say those two small words. Alice&#039;s &quot;fish-face,&quot; combined with the sparkle, always made me smile, as did everyone&#039;s minimalist expressions. Also, that meat dance at the barbecue was not only out of nowhere, but pretty hilarious, too.<br />
<br />
This season also got to me a few times. Not crying, but getting that lump in the throat and the watery eyes. Specifically, it was the student&#039;s letter, the &quot;nightshine&quot; chime, and the gondola. Each dealt with saying goodbye, and each time it emotionally resonated with me. Which is really intriguing; they&#039;re &quot;just&quot; inanimate objects, but the set-ups, the characters, and the mood made those moments stand out.<br />
<br />
As a sequel, Aria the Natural improves in many key areas. The story finds more overall worth and the characters become more than just placeholders. Combined with small tweaks to sound and animation, its nearly done all that it can. With one season left, hopefully Akari, Aika, and Alice are given the proper sendoff that this season demonstrated that they deserve.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Great, multiple moods, individual and collective themes, nice balance in storytelling<br />
<br />
Animation: Good, nice art style, appropriate character designs, average actual animation<br />
<br />
Characters: Good, Akari, Aika, and Alice see nice development, with Alicia, Akira, and Athena guiding them along the way<br />
<br />
Sound: Good, good OP, good ED, great soundtrack with some distracting pieces, great VA work<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Good, usually funny, sometimes emotional, always Aria<br />
<br />
Final Score: 8/10

    If one is lucky, there may come a point in life were you experience a prolonged period of happiness and peace, a seemingly never ending golden age of joy and determination that makes pale all other periods in comparison as the sun does the moon. Everything may not exactly be perfect, quite the contrary it may be a period of struggle and poverty, perfection is in no way a prerequisite, at the time it may not even seem that you are inordinately happy, but upon reflection you realise that those were the best years of your life. The great tragedy of the present is that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review120007">
        we can never see it for what it is until it becomes the past… To create a series in which one can witness these feeling played out with an almost musical perfection is no small feat and a rare privilege for the viewer indeed. To accurately capture characters with a dream which while still some distance away are working towards it incrementally, getting a little closer each day, not yet bound by nostalgia to the past but grown beyond simply dreaming of the future, opting instead to somnambulate towards it one day at a time, this is Aria the natural&#039;s crowning achievement, portraying the present...  <br />
<br />
Aria the natural, so called because the 26 episodes allowed for the show to flow more naturally, is exactly what a sequel should be, an improvement on the original in every way that loses nothing that made the first season so likeable while adding a new beauty to the mix. Expanding on everything from the characters, their lives, the city of Neo-Venezia and its surroundings to its history and its mysterious inhabitants whilst retaining even refining the natural quiet atmosphere that made so many of us fall in love with the show to begin with. The series manages, despite it ostentatious surroundings, to portray the simplicity of the present, to be working towards something you want while doing something you love, its a rare experience but a beautiful one thats very difficult to accurately capture in any medium, but somehow Aria the natural manages to pull it off...<br />
<br />
The premise of the show is pretty much verbatim the same as the first season, the story continues to follow Akari as she and her close friends continue to chase their dream of becoming Undines (Female Gondoliers) in the beautiful and mysterious city of Neo-Venezia, a brick for brick restoration of the ancient city of Venice now built on Mars (renamed Aqua due to the now abundance of water thanks to terraforming). While the general feel and plot of the show remains like the city itself, timeless, don&#039;t be fooled into thinking that this is just season 1 all over again. Only a superficial glance could misled someone to this conclusion, Aria the Natural may retain much of the basic style and structures from Aria the Animation but its outlook and themes are profoundly different. Aria the Animation was basically an intro to the world of Aria, it set up the characters, set the tone and pace but the restrictions on its length prevented it from being able to do much more than simply open the door to this world a smidgen. With the &quot;Natural series&quot; the door is thrown open and we are free to dive fully into everything, be it the city with its history and inhabitants who range from ordinary people who make it tick to the more mysterious creatures that give the city its unique atmosphere. Of even greater importance is the main cast, which are finally given the time to unfurl and bloom naturally in-keeping with the shows subdued and free flowing pace; a greater focus on the supporting cast also allows the viewer to begin to see this city and its inhabitants as being an actual living city with a shared past and vibrant present, this allows the show to step back and instead of telling us that the city is a magical wonderful place as they did so much in the first season it lets us be witness to it.   <br />
<br />
But what really sets this series part from the previous series and indeed most other shows in general is that it is extremely difficult to categorise or place in any particular genre. The show despite is slow pace and relaxing story telling atmosphere manages to oscillate wildly from slice of life, Sci-fi, fantasy, historical, romance and even a bit of horror, in particular the fantasy element is extremely prevalent here when compared with Aria the Animation or Aria the Origination. Some may find this a little distracting but personally I feel the show manages to balance it all rather well, mostly because it feels natural, with the more fantastical elements being prevalent only when focusing on the ancient city and most important of all only when Akari is alone, it is hinted at many times throughout the show that the spirits are uniquely interested in Akari and that her kind hearted natural curiosity allows her to get much closer than most people could dream of. In other words there is a good deal of separation between the more character based episodes and the episodes which deal exclusively with the city and its spirits, meaning that things never get muddled and we are allowed to enjoy all the different sides to Neo-Venezia, ranging from simple treasure hunts and lounging around in cafes on warm summer afternoons to nearly being spirited away by a ghost and dancing with a cat god. The fact that Aria the natural is able to balance all of this without ever becoming the equivalent of an explosion in a paint factory is a testament to its wonder as a series, it manages to mix science and fantasy, ghosts and slice of life, detailed characters and a episodic storyline together in a way that would sink other series&#039; faster than a ship without a bottom.        <br />
<br />
The glowing vintage of the show is its characters which are given here what the first season could not provide them with, room to breathe. Because there was so much to set up in season 1 combined with its relative briskness there wasn&#039;t much time to allow the characters to develop and act naturally, but now with ample time at their finger tips the creators managed to give them the space and more importantly the reasons for them to develop and change as real people do. Driven on by their dream of becoming &quot;primas&quot; they gradually become more skilled as undines but more importantly they learn more about the city they live in and the people and creatures they share it with. It is through these experiences that they are moulded into deeper characters and not just cardboard cutouts gawking at the background and espousing exposition about the city. Even the girls mentors are given a considerably higher class of character than you would expect, each one is completely distinguishable from the other and I&#039;m not talking about hair colours here, their personalities and how they instruct their girls is completely different but strangely in tune with their students and their own characters. This welcome addition creates the real joy of the series, seeing all of these characters and the supporting cast together, its wonderful to see their different personalities conflict and compliment each other, watching them bounce off one another and argue over trivial matters or laugh at nothing really creates the feeling that these are real people and Neo-Venezia is a living city alive and not just a museum or a piece of art. <br />
<br />
To ultimate, Aria the Natural is a textbook example of a sequel done right, keeping what works and building upon the foundation so strongly laid down in Aria the Animation yet still managing to be a very unique series. At its heart its the same show but its outlook on the world is very different, it no longer feels like its trapped in the past or static. Instead its characters and the world they inhabit are changing and this creates a much more interesting and realistic world that makes the show such a joy to watch, through clever and serene stories we see all the nooks and cranny&#039;s of the city, from its canals and ancient buildings to the surrounding countryside and beyond. What really makes this series great is that nothing is rushed or forced, at the risk of sounding like broken record, everything flows naturally, the extra time won by the success of Aria the Animation allowed for this series to take it to the next level creating more than just a pretty looking, utopian fluff fest and instead a realistic story of people. Not at war or fighting each other, not facing death or destruction but instead trying to live and be happy, a rare topic indeed and one that deserves a greater audience than it has. To portray happiness, which is usually the end goal of a series, is harder than you&#039;d think yet Aria the Natural achieves it because it understands that happiness doesn&#039;t come from living in perfection having achieved all your goals rather happiness come from doing what you love with people you love and for that to happen time has to be moving and in aria the natural it finally is…

    This is the second Aria season, based on the slice of life manga Aria, which, on a side note, has finished publishing in Japan.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The plot is quite similar to the first season, but now the individual stories are even better. Some of the episodes were pure brilliance, while the rest were really, really good. There is even some character development, and some unexpected twists. I also think that the episodes were well planned, with build-up and a sort of climax. Not much action, though, only the regular lives of the undines on Aqua. The sci-fi element worked well, as always.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
The animation is really lovely. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3461">
        panorama-views look really good, and the backgrounds do as well. I liked the character designs a lot, but I think the animation could have been better. Specially facial expressions could have been more detailed, though, their funny faces are really hilarious. Still the animation fits the general feel nicely. I also have to mention the uniforms, they look splendid.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
As brilliant as in the first season. Background music is simply superb, always fitting well with the situation. I didn&#039;t like the OP and ED as much as those in season one, though, but I can forgive that, since the OP and ED in Aria the Animation was ridiculously good. The same seyiu, and I have no complaints in that department.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
Lovely characters, nothing less to be said. They all have a special place in my heart (embarrassing remarks aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed, eh?). But seriously, all of them are really special. Akari, Aika and Alice all could fight for a place among my favourite characters. Alicia is also lovely, as well as Akira and Athena. But, there should have been a few more recurring side characters, though. Athena could have gotten some more screen time too, hence the 9.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
This was one of few shows I really didn&amp;rsquo;t want to end. I tried to save episodes for later, so that I could enjoy the life on Aqua a bit longer. Even though I spent almost a month on the 26 episodes, it feels like the episodes just flew by. I just loved this. What&amp;rsquo;s really the best, is that there&amp;rsquo;s no tension, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t get stressed out when watching. You can just sit back and watch.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
I have to say this show is brilliant. 26 episodes of slice of life heaven is just ingenious. Everyone should watch this, unless you are too impatient of course. It was almost a bit sad when I finished it. Thankfully there are also an OVA and another season. Yay for Aria.

    Dear customers, allow me, your Undine, to guide you down the many waterways of Neo-Venezia. It is a beautiful town with many sincere people and beautiful sights. While simple and honest, I hope that the sentiments of this town touch your hearts.<br />
<br />
Often labeled as ‘relaxing’ and ‘cute’, Aria is definitely a soothing experience that you can kick back to after any day. However, to write Aria off as just that would be imprudent. While it can be watched solely for those reasons, I believe it is truly a heartfelt and down-to-earth journey down life’s avenues. With a multitude of gently suggested morals and life stories,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review216924">
        it is a franchise that will grow on you with time, as you discover Neo-Venezia episode by episode. It wasn’t until Aria the Natural (Natural) that I fell for the Aria franchise, so allow me to share my “Natural” experience with you.<br />
<br />
Neo-Venezia is almost surreal. Set a few hundred years into the future on Aqua, a terraformed Mars, the town is a replica of Manhome’s (formerly named Earth) Venice. Centred on the lives of Undines, the gondolier tour guides of the Neo-Venezia, it is easy to feel distant to such a foreign world introduced by Aria the Animation (Animation). Natural made me realize that this is anything but the case: Neo-Venezia is actually closer to home than you’d believe.<br />
<br />
Extending the episodic storyline that began in Animation, Natural depicts Akari Mizunashi continuing her training to become a Prima Undine. Just like how a mosaic is made up of many small pieces of coloured glass to make a beautiful piece of art, Natural is best thought of as an ensemble. Whereas Animation and Aria the Origination (Origination) are introduction and conclusion respectively, Natural focuses on further acquainting the viewer with the characters and the town. Each episode represents a single mundane event in Akari’s life and, through her experiences, the viewer is exposed to the people and places of Neo-Venezia. While this gives important depth to the characters, the episodes offer many easy-to-receive messages or, better yet, “Natural” life truths. Themes such as serendipity, the importance of being yourself, and finding the best in any situation underscore many of Natural’s episodes. Just like a mosaic, Natural has an array of messages and is sure to have a meaning that resonates with every viewer.<br />
<br />
The way these messages are presented to the viewer echo the honest nature of Aria. Almost every episode in Natural follows the same outline. Akari writes a letter to Ai, often suggesting the themes that will be covered in the episode, before the opening plays. The viewer is allowed time to mull the meaning over, as soft music floats by. There are no flashy, distracting animated sequences, showing only the Undines interacting with their “Natural” environment. The usually lighthearted, everyday story then unfolds and is concluded with Ai’s reply to Akari’s letter, which tends to be a one-liner that encapsulates the theme of the episode. The episode presentation is down-to-earth, but in that way it is beautiful. It is never forceful in its delivery, rather it gently suggests a message, leaving acceptance up to the discretion of the viewer. As a result, Natural never compromises its relaxing atmosphere. The themes are never jarring, since they are optional, and are a nice touch to the anime.<br />
<br />
If each episode is comparable to a piece of a mosaic, then surely the characters are the colours of each shard. While unpolished in Animation, the waves of Aqua progressively smooth over their edges and every character is given a chance to shine in Natural. The anime never reveals everything about the characters all at once, rather over time it reveals more about them than just their little quirks, allowing the audience insight into our Undines’ hopes and fears. By the end of Natural, the viewer will be able to understand each Undine’s distinct personality, though it may not have been explicitly stated. Natural’s character development is comparable to making friends in real life: it is “Natural”. The viewer meets the characters and slowly, mundane encounter after mundane encounter, they become more comfortable with the diverse cast and immersed in their lives.<br />
<br />
The mosaic ensemble of these colourful fragments is Neo-Venezia, the heart of this franchise. Discounted by people as a fake, Neo-Venezia is a town trying to prove its identity. Although this is special, as it echoes our guides’ aspirations of becoming Prima Undines, it is also special since it allows the viewer to get to know the town for what it is. There is a saying that every city has character, but Neo-Venezia has so much soul that it is a literal character. It is more than a setting, as Neo-Venezia possesses a distinct personality. Along every gondola ride with our Undine guides, the viewer is introduced to an array of townspeople. Whether it be a mailman or a café owner, it is easy to get a sense of the resonating kindness that the inhabitants of Neo-Venezia emit. These characters are often involved in the themes of each episode, further strengthening the sense of honesty that Neo-Venezia embodies. <br />
<br />
Artistically, Natural is also very down-to-earth like its predecessor. Using a very delicate palette of vibrant colours and with smooth simplistic animation, Natural is pleasurable to look at, yet its art does not steal the show. The anime does not rely on flashy expositions and, as a result, the anime is able to hide its age. While I’ve discounted the art as humble, the anime portrays Neo-Venezia’s many landmarks, such as San Marco’s Square or St. Mark’s Campanile, and waterways in a very realistic manner. In 2010, I had the joy of visiting the city for several days and I can safely assure other viewers that Aria’s depiction of Neo-Venezia is unnervingly similar to Venice. Natural is not so much an anime that will wow you with its animation, rather it will move you with its candid portrayal of Neo-Venezia.<br />
<br />
Natural’s soundtrack is very similar to Animation’s. As aforementioned, this anime is very relaxing and the music truly sets the soothing, healing mood. The soundtrack is populated by many soft songs that could probably lull you to sleep, however I think that Natural’s soundtrack does much more than that. It is said that the songs were composed according to abstract themes instead of plot points and this shows up in the final product. The best part of the soundtrack is the diversity of the emotions portrayed, as the songs somehow fit the wide range of sentiments inspired by the everyday events on screen, whether guiding a gondola down a mysterious waterway or being surprised by a new outlook on life. Not to be forgotten, the new opening and ending themes are excellent, both in terms of meaning and listening. The opening theme, Euforia, captures both the sense that a fleeting encounter is not the end of the road, but a memory that lasts forever, and the gentleness of the waters of Neo-Venezia. The ending themes, Natsu Machi, Smile Again, and Rainbow, conclude each episode by reminding the viewer that a goodbye only lasts until we meet again. The soundtrack is something that I, myself, have downloaded and would strongly encourage viewers to check out.<br />
<br />
Regarding the voice acting, I feel conflicted. The voice acting in Animation never stood out to me, however, in Natural, the voice actors seemed to fit their characters better. They showed a diversity of emotions that was not present in Animation, as there is a wider range of themes confronted in Natural. What can be concluded from this is that the voices grew on me. For example, I warmed up to Saito Chiwa’s (Aika’s) voice acting more following the episodes centered on Aika, whereas before she was more memorable just for her “hazukashii serifu kinshi” moments. The voices of the characters will initially strike the viewer as cute, but I think that, as one watches more Aria, their speech patterns and mannerisms will become more intimate than just adorable.<br />
<br />
Aria is a franchise that I wish I started earlier, yet I am also glad that I waited this long to explore this world. Introduced to me by a friend as his favourite anime, I could not help but disregard the plot of “gondoliers on Mars” as an outlandish concept. I was never really a huge fan of the first season, but Natural quickly found a place in my heart. The themes are better presented and are definitely more relatable. The anime builds off the introductions made by Animation, fleshing out both the characters and the setting. It is a slow process, but in turn it fosters a very warm, family-like environment. In this way, it made me appreciate the development of Animation a lot more.<br />
<br />
Whether Natural (or Aria as a whole) is watched for the overarching Prima Undine plot, the relaxing atmosphere, or the subtle life themes, I am sure there is some value for every viewer, regardless of gender or age. As far as the genre goes, Natural is not so much just a slice out of the lives of the inhabitants of Neo-Venezia, but also a slice out of the viewer’s. When watching Natural, begin with Animation first, otherwise you will miss out on the crescendo of subtleties that characterizes this franchise. Most of all, watch it a little a time. Not only is it a show best left for reflection and relaxation, but it is also a truly beautiful journey that will inevitably end.<br />
<br />
Neo-Venezia is very dear to my heart. It is a special, special place: the setting of many of my warm memories. You’ve heard about my “Natural” experience, but, if Aria has taught me anything, memories are best shared. Take a step forward, onto your Undine’s gondola and allow yourself to be immersed in the melody of Aria.

    Right off the bat I’d like to note that this show is definitely not for everybody. The Aria series as a whole is extremely slow paced, and while it does a great job at creating an incredibly ambient, calming atmosphere, at the same time I can easily see people get bored of this series. Aria may not have the most compelling story out there, but in its stead it has a very detailed, well thought out setting, as well as a charming bunch of characters. The slow pace to this second season really does a great job with fleshing out setting little by little, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34839">
        the main characters compliment this very well. There are a few issues I did have with the series (the unnecessarily large amount of episodes to Cait Sith would be one of them), and how character development didn’t really kick into high gear until towards the end of the series, but the charm this show exudes kept everything entertaining right until the end.<br />
<br />
Production values for the Aria series have proven to be quite decent, and this season of Aria proves to be no different. While the animation itself was standard, the artwork really does this show justice with it’s very well drawn, beautiful scenic depictions of the city of Neo-Venezia. The music for this series is also notable for it’s very calm, melodic tones that keep the atmospheric calming feeling that this series is famous for. Aria’s ambient music is excellent, and does a great job in complementing the very heavily water-themed city. In fact, the large presence of water and waterways is probably one of the big factors that contributes to the calm, relaxing nature of this show.<br />
<br />
While the first season served as a brief introduction to the world of Aqua in general, the second season goes into much more depth in exploring this very unique setting. The scenery may be great in this show, but it’s really the subtle details and stories that really make the setting come to life. There are those episodes involving solely the supernatural, which I’ve noticed are either hit or miss for me; there were too many Cait Sith episodes for my liking, but there were also supernatural-focused episodes that I found had their own unique charms. Overall, though, I felt that this season could have cut back a little on all the supernatural-heavy stuff.<br />
<br />
However, where this show really left a lasting impression on me was not the supernatural episodes, but rather the ordinary everyday episodes that explore the ever growing and maturing city of Neo-Venezia. It’s really the small, little memories involving our main characters that makes the setting feel alive, and as the show progressed I came to appreciate that much, much more.<br />
<br />
What I didn’t quite like about the first season to this show was the extremely slow pacing (which often put me to sleep), which this season did improve upon. That doesn’t mean the pacing for this season was fast by any means. Even so the pacing here really matches well with the characters in general, and helps flesh out our goofy cast of characters. We still have our goofy Akari, the too serious Alice, and the hardworking Aika, along with the quirky little cat President Aria, which I’ve come to like for their own little quirks and charming points.<br />
<br />
It isn’t until towards the end of the season that the characters get a more significant amount of development, but everything along the way helped flesh things out little by little. In particular, the dialogue for this series is important, as the dialogue uses some very detailed and imaginative ideas (though also very cliche at times) to give us some deep insight into the history of our setting, the growth of our characters, and the community of Neo-Venezia as a whole.<br />
<br />
The major flaw to Aria is how the characters stay relatively the same for the most part, with character development extremely slow (it only begins to pick up towards the end, which leads up to season three). For the most part, though, Aria has some unique points to it that should make it a compelling watch for anybody that likes the “kuuki-kei” ambience atmospheric (often called slice of life) anime. As I mentioned in my review of the first season, Aria is definitely not a show to expect a tremendous amount of action or drama from, but rather a simple, ordinary yet fascinating and charming tale of Neo-Venezia and it’s inhabitants.<br />

    Story<br />
<br />
Aria the Natural continues where Aria the Origination left off, chronicling the adventures of our very likeable main protagonist Akari and her best friends and fellow Undines (Gondoliers) Aika and Alice. Most of the episodes start off with Akari writing to her friend Ai-Chan about what is happening at Neo-Venezia and ends with a closing narration. The difference is, with Aria this is not only seamless, but very natural and fits the anime.<br />
<br />
This is a true slice of life anime, the stories are random, mostly standalone (except a few arcs) and can be picked up at any time. All the stories are compelling in some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14843">
        form or another, and this anime is one of the best &quot;feel good&quot; anime I&#039;ve ever seen. Aria the Natural is fantastically profound in that it can make you think and start to appreciate the little things in life that make it great to be alive because one can continue to experience wonderful new things and learn about themselves/the world/others.<br />
<br />
Character and music<br />
<br />
All the characters in this anime are well developed - the undines, their inner circle, customers, the city, the CATS! *poing-yau*, the music and the gondola. Aria the Natural made me feel as if I knew the planet Aqua and the city Neo Venezia, not just as some foreign place, but as if I&#039;d lived there. Even though it is a fictional city, the watcher could easily get swept up in the pulse of the city/world.<br />
<br />
Aah, the cats. Maybe it&#039;s because I love cats (even the unrealistically long lived 50+ year old President Aria) but no one who has watched Aria could possibly consider them just animals because of their intelligence and ability to emote. And then there&#039;s Cait Sith, who adds so much more than just mystery to Aria the Natural.<br />
<br />
The music in this series is so good it is not background but it is like having another character. Everything fits the story perfectly. I would never skip through the OP because the animation changes each episode. Think of it this way, instead of the same stock OP song, you get a brief start of the anime, then it segues into the characters doing stuff as the opening song is on. So don&#039;t skip the OP. Also, the OP (euphoria) is so beautiful it&#039;s worth listening to again and again. Just so you know, I had to get the whole soundtrack. I can&#039;t say enough good things about the music - it can transport you to another realm of feeling.<br />
<br />
Finally, I have to mention the gondola. Just because I never thought I would be the kind of person who could possibly ever have feelings for a &quot;boat&quot;. *Embarrassing remarks not allowed*. But seriously, Aria did it so well it wrung all those emotions out of me I didn&#039;t even think I had. If you&#039;ve seen those episodes you will understand :)<br />
<br />
Art<br />
<br />
For the most part I enjoyed the animation in Aria the Natural. I still hate when it goes to the super deformed mode as I generally don&#039;t like that. The rest of the animation is great and I wish they didn&#039;t bother swapping art styles, oh well.  If not for that I would have scored this anime a 10.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment and Overall<br />
<br />
For maximum enjoyment of Aria the Natural, I recommend you do NOT marathon this series. Instead, think of each episode like a piece of sweet, gourmet chocolate. Whenever you&#039;re having a bad day or feeling down, watch 1-3 episodes for an instant pick me up. I guess if you like sugar rush you could marathon it. But seriously ...<br />
<br />
Take your time. Savor the feelings and reactions this show evokes in you. Reflect on the small positive messages sprinkled throughout the series and believe in the promise that tomorrow is another day to be filled with new learnings and experiences. If watched with an open heart and mind, this anime is should leave a small smile on your face pretty much nearly every episode :)<br />
<br />
Please, enjoy! The whole series can be summed up as &quot;and I think to myself, what a Wonderful World&quot;. I&#039;m was really sad this was finished but now I have Arietta and Aria the Origination to look forward to.<br />

    Aria the Natural is at least twice the length of both the prequel and sequel that followed it. Production wise, it&#039;s about the same, but what makes it an improvement in comparison to the original is a stronger sense of focus. As I stated in the previous review, Animation was the foundation as it introduced the characters and setting while Natural builds upon those ideas and creates a stronger narrative. While it&#039;s also mostly episodic, it does have compelling character arcs and explores the supernatural elements of the series. The wonderful city of miracles Neo-Venenzia gets explored more as opposed to the original work, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350317">
        there are some very strong character arcs to accompany those adventures, mainly focusing on Akari and Aika as far as character arcs are concerned. Now, I would recommend reading the Animation review first, as I talked about the characters for the most part in the review. This one is more focused on the episodes and the character arcs that emerge from them. Now, with that said, let&#039;s begin!<br />
<br />
The world of Aqua is given a greater focus in this season, and it becomes clear that there&#039;s more to the city of Neo-Venenzia than meets the eye. The first episode makes this clear, as the Carnevale festival begins and Ai makes a return to the city to visit during this time. Before it happens, President Aria disappears, and Akari explains that he leaves every time this festival occurs. Everyone, aside from the main characters, wears masks for the festivals (not the kind we have to wear, lmao), and the Cat King is mentioned and houses secret meetings for cats. When Akari and Ai both follow a small creature with a robe and a mask, and they meet the Cat King or Cassanova as a result. A massive black cat that can stand on his two legs. He gives them both flowers, and the Cat King, or Cait Sith, and his followers disappear. This is what shows us and Akari and Ai that there are wondrous secrets in Neo-Venenzia. Honestly, I believed that Cait Sith would be a one off appearance, but he makes a lot of appearances in the show than you would expect. He&#039;s a crucial character to the show and helps Akari grow to love the city even more than before. This season is far more focused on building the world of Aqua than the other two seasons.<br />
<br />
Before we get into that, I must talk about two characters. First, there&#039;s a new character named Albery Pitt, who was actually introduced in the last episode of Animation, but he&#039;s more present here. He&#039;s usually just called AL and he&#039;s a childhood friend for Akatsuki. He&#039;s an apprentice gnome and he works to help maintain Aqua&#039;s gravity levels. Aika is also shown to have a major crush on him, although this is mostly a background element until one particular episode towards the end of the season. There are a few episodes focusing on this crush. Another thing worth noting about him is that he likes to make &quot;old man jokes&quot;, much to Aika&#039;s annoyance and the other&#039;s confusion. He appears to be much younger than everyone else, but he&#039;s actually 19, so about as old as Alicia and Akatsuki. This is due to his growth being slowed by the gravitational forces underneath Aqua, but he&#039;s still capable of growing despite his age. He&#039;s intelligent and knowledgeable about space.<br />
<br />
The second character I&#039;ll mention is the guy I should&#039;ve talked more about last time, President Aria. He&#039;s Akari&#039;s goofy cat companion who is often present in many of Akari&#039;s misadventures around the city. What&#039;s interesting about Aria and other Aqua cats like President Hime from the HImeya company and President Maa of Orange Planet is that they seem to understand what humans are saying to them, and Aria is a very intelligent cat in particular. He not only can fully comprehend what everyone else is saying, but he also can stand on two legs, and move his other two like arms. He makes strange noises to respond to his friends. Another thing worth noting is that he seems to be very old for a cat. Grandma was the one who founded the Aria company and named it after him, and he looked just like he did in the show, but that&#039;s a detail I&#039;ll get to in Origination. And he was around back when Alicia was Grandma&#039;s apprentice, until the present. It looks like he hasn&#039;t aged a day. He&#039;s like Will Smith. Aside from that, he also gets some interactions with the other cats, like President Hime, who he tries to flirt with, but she doesn&#039;t seem to care, and President Maa only seems interested in biting his chubby belly as a running gag. Finally, as a cat, he seems to be a part of this cat group alongside Cait Sith and other cats.<br />
<br />
Back to the more supernatural bits, what&#039;s interesting is like the sci-fi elements, it&#039;s never really explained because that&#039;s not the point of the show, it&#039;s the sense of wonder that they bring Akari and the viewers. Unlike the sci-fi elements, however, we do get glimpses of this fantastical world. The frequent appearances of Cait Sith and his group of cats are the main supernatural element. The main thing about the supernatural elements is that Akari is the one who experiences them, and she usually experiences them alone. Such as the headless ghost lady, and the fox. While episodes like those have ominous connotations to them, they end with a nice resolution and some reflection of the episode. The cat group shows up in different locations and Akari sees them in at different points in the story. There was this one episode where Aika and Akari try to follow Aria to find out where he&#039;s going, but after getting lost in a Legend of Zelda lost woods kind of scenario (Not literally in a forest, mind you), Aria leads them out of the abandoned building area and Akari catches a glimpse of the group of cats before they leave. There are other times where they show up and that reaches a head in episode 19, where they leave and never show up in Neo-Venenzia. Cait Sith only reveals himself to people like Akari, who has this constant sense of wonder and admiration for the city, and their encounters only reinforce that core idea.<br />
<br />
The supernatural elements are more of a background element, however. The main thing about Natural is the stronger sense of community that the city presents. We are shown far more locations, and we meet all kinds of different people throughout the season. We see all the different activities and festivals that these people participate in, like the Carnevale festival or the Night Shine Chime festival, where they make sounds and emit light in the darkness. People take boats to the water and gather around to show off the lights before they burn and fall into the ocean. They say &quot;Tante Grazie&quot; or &quot;Many Thanks&quot; after it falls into the endless abyss that is the ocean. Akari&#039;s light falls into the ocean but leaves behind a night shine crystal, symbolizing Akari&#039;s sentimentality and attachment to the city and friends.<br />
<br />
At the center of all of these events is Akari, who allows the audience to see the setting unfold alongside her. She&#039;s still an Undine in training, so she believes that she has a lot to learn, but it feels like all of these supernatural or otherwise normal events are often happening around her. It might be because of her kind and caring demeanor, or it might be because of her sense of wonder like I pointed out before, but regardless, she&#039;s a charming lense to the audience. Take episode 10 for example. Aika and Alice are following Akari around because she draws people in due to her friendly and sociable nature. There was this one guy she meets that Aika and Alice both find suspicious, so they decide to follow them. It was later revealed that he is a street performer, and he has Akari help him in his show to entertain kids. Or take episode 4 for example, where she travels with the mailman around the city because his gondola was broken, and Akari would share one with him to travel around. They meet up with a boy named Sora (who&#039;s also voiced by Mokoto Kumai, who also voiced Syaoran from Cardcaptor Sakura. Seriously, they sound the same, lmao), who wrote a letter to apologize to his teacher for saying that he was glad that she was gone. She was leaving because she was getting married, and they took him there to give the letter to her directly. Akari, using her backward paddling skills (It makes her go faster), was able to get there on time. There are also the two gondola episodes, where she must get a new one because of how old her gondola is, and Alicia and Akari reminisce about all of the good memories they had with it. Things like this show that Akari is willing to help others without anything in return, and it&#039;s a joy seeing her interact with other characters, or learning more about Neo-Venenzia.<br />
<br />
Alice&#039;s arc isn&#039;t as focused on as Akari&#039;s or Aika&#039;s, but it does show her slowly try to get out of her bubble that she puts herself in. The episode where she invites Akari and AIka to Orange Planet would be the first example. She&#039;s invited by the other pairs to a party, but she looks like she&#039;s going to decline via the letter they gave her. This is because she believes they don&#039;t like her and that she&#039;s afraid they wouldn&#039;t have anything to talk about together. Athena starts combing her hair after their hot bath, and she says that people are like mirrors. If you smile, they smile. If you&#039;re nervous, they&#039;re nervous. President Maa climbing her bed to bite President Aria&#039;s stomach also ironically inspired her to become more socially active and also more expressive. Another example is when Alice is trying to give herself bizarre rules, like when she wants it to make it all the way to Orange Planet from her school by jumping on shadows. What sounds like a really weird and childish episode ends on a really sweet note to teach Alice to realize that it&#039;s ok to lean on others and ask for help. This arc culminates into a grand finale in Origination, but more on that in that review.<br />
<br />
Finally, there&#039;s Aika. Her arc is more pronounced than the other two, as, after an accident, she goes through a bit of an identity crisis, and she wanted to be just like Alicia, and while Akari and Alice try to cheer her up, but it doesn&#039;t really work. Akira shows up and tries to cheer up Akira in her way. After what she said, Aika goes through a transformation, regaining her sense of pride and competitive spirit. She still has more episodes focused on her, like when she gets sick and worries that Alice and Akari don&#039;t need her, or when Aika goes for a different style but is worried about how AL will react. Stuff like that helps flesh her character out and makes her more relatable to the viewer. She&#039;s a really solid character that you do want to see succeed because she&#039;s trying her best to and helps Akari and Alice as well. Like Alice, Aika&#039;s arc gets resolved later on in Origination.<br />
<br />
To wrap up, all of the characters meet up for a party on a large boat and the three main leads organize it themselves. Ai goes silent in the emails for a while due to personal reasons, so Akari is worried that she wouldn&#039;t make it for Redentore. A festival based on a festival in Venice where they would go on boats and party till the sun came up to celebrate the beginning of Fall. Akira and the other Water Fairies make the girls organize it as a test. They have to have food and entertainment. As the party is set up and is about to leave, they decide to start leaving, but Ai just barely makes it on time. So they meet up, and they all go on this boat. The last episode focuses on just Akari and Alicia, where they make this giant snowball, and other townspeople help them push it around. Akari asks Alicia why she chose her for her student. Alicia doesn&#039;t give her a direct answer, but she does tell her that the same thing happened to her when she was a kid in regards to the snowball when she was younger, I won&#039;t go into the exact ending after that, but it is a fitting end to a heartfelt sequel that improves upon Animation. But before we close off, let&#039;s talk about the OVA about Alicia.<br />
<br />
Arietta<br />
<br />
One thing that becomes obvious right away is the sheer spike in quality as far as animation is concerned. Hal Film Maker received a lot more money for the series after Natural, so they had the resources to improve on the animation. For one, the 4:3 aspect ratio that was used for Animation and Natural is gone, going for a fullscreen that would be present for the rest of the show. The other thing is that the character designs are more lively and are crisper as opposed to the previous seasons, while still maintaining the charm of the designs. Backgrounds look even more stunning than before, and so many screenshots can be taken. Origination would stick to this look and Avvenire would make it even better.<br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s the story, which starts off with Akari dreaming about being a Prima Undine and Alicia not being there. It even has Ai over there in the dream, as a bit of foreshadowing. As Akari tells Alicia this, she tells her that she felt sad when Grandma left and tells Akari about a backstory regarding Campanile. I won&#039;t go into more detail to avoid spoilers, but it&#039;s a nice transition to Origination. It foreshadows the end of Origination quite well.<br />
<br />
All and all, Natural is a vast improvement to Animation. It does a much better job of exploring the characters and setting while also setting up Origination as well. It&#039;s just a pleasant ride through and through, and Origination is an even better experience, but we&#039;ll save that for the next one.<br />

    Welcome to Aqua, or Neo Venezia, a serenity, an escape far away from reality. <br />
<br />
I had the chance to finish Aria&#039;s the Animation (S1) a while ago and to be frank, I didn&#039;t really enjoy it as much as I hoped I would. Mostly, the pacing of S1 is incredibly slow and it was just kind of boring (blame the slow pacing) but true to that, I did give it another chance and finished it within 2 months. 13 episodes in a period of 2 months IS indeed pretty slow by my standards. Back on S2, also known as natural, I finally figured out and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review233786">
        completed the puzzle about how great Aria could potentially be. Aria&#039;s S2 yes, and yes, mostly focuses on the world of Aria because most of the introductions to the characters and world were made in S1.<br />
<br />
From my own standpoint, the beauty of Aria is it&#039;s heart and soul. <br />
<br />
Everything about Aqua is beautiful and tranquil and it reminds us how complicated the world is when it&#039;s really not. The CHARACTERS are INCREDIBLY lovable, and addictive, especially the trio. It&#039;s great that the series also sticks to and focuses on only a few major characters other than adding more and more characters to the series, keeping it really simple. Presidents of each of the gondola companies are cute as well. Personally, I believe the seiyuus (voice actresses) did a more than amazing job on character portrayal, each character feels so true to their own.<br />
<br />
Also, the MUSIC is just amazing, although there is much reuse of the same score over and over, the piano bgm just gives you that fuzzy, calming feeling that makes you all warm inside. Also, about the OP and EDs, totally fitting into the theme. Nothing feels out of place and you instantly feel transported into the world of Aqua. <br />
<br />
ART wise, I feel the animation could be improved here and there but it was great putting in consideration it was made in 2006. The art proves itself great if I were to talk about the scenery and Aqua as a whole. The viewer is able to see and learn more about Aqua in the process while enjoying all these small subtle mini-stories that happen to the Aqua trio along the way, which is pretty cool.<br />
<br />
As for the ENJOYMENT, I could say I really am enjoying it if not I wouldn&#039;t rather waste my time writing a review about it in the first place. Is there any bad things I could say about Aria S2? Not much. It just maintains its&#039; theme (for it being slow paced) throughout the series and could be overcome if you are already at S2 lol. <br />
<br />
Take a chill pill and relax. Aqua and Aria is meant to be enjoyed. Make yourself some hot green tea, dive into your blanket and delve into the world of Aria and find yourself transported into this beautiful, heartwarming, joyful goodness.<br />
<br />
edit: &quot;I believe that happiness does come from the smallest, most trivial things in life. Definitely not power, money or greed&quot; - 11/16<br />

    In 2005, the anime community was given Aria The Animation, a show that showcased how we people can miss the smaller, more minute parts of our lives that we take for granted, which in turn displayed its unique characteristics and turned it into a beloved anime.  And only after one year of it existing, do we get Aria the Natural, a sequel to Animation.  So, what did this sequel have in store this time?<br />
<br />
Story (8.45/10): Likewise to Animation, Natural bears the same story.  Picking up relatively back where Animation left off, we return back to the world of Aqua, the terraformed planet

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190017">
        formerly known as Mars, back to the city of Neo-Venezia where our main protagonist Akari trains to become a Prima Undine, a gondola driver in the city that she loves.  <br />
<br />
Similarly to Animation, Natural essentially uses the same style of storytelling that it used before, which was in a nutshell, having the characters of the show go about their daily lives, having fun, going on little adventures, and laughing, before giving an existential lesson about the experience that our characters, mainly Akari have.  While the two seasons do bear this style of storytelling, Natural goes a bit further, in a more...interesting manner.<br />
<br />
Contrary to Animation, Natural not only focuses on Akari and her daily life, but with the daily lives, trials and tribulations, of almost every character in the series.  Because Natural is twice as long as Animation, the show is given a lot more time and a lot more leeway to explore and pencil in details that not only add to the story, but tie a lot of things together.  We don&#039;t just solely focus on Akari this time, rather, we focus on her friends Aika and Alice a lot more, as well as the other side characters that were featured in Animation.  As such, the characters feel a lot more lifelike and as an audience, we get to understand them a lot more than we did before.  <br />
<br />
In addition, Natural also places some heavy emphasis on world building.  You learn more about Neo-Venezia&#039;s culture, its history, and the occasional supernatural occurrence that Akari for some reason keeps finding.  Within practically every episode, you learn a little bit more about the trades and customs that exist within this remade Venice, which I think adds more to the experience that is Aria.  <br />
<br />
However, because this is Aria, it suffers a similar debacle as Animation does, which is its occasional inability to grasp the viewer&#039;s attention.  That is, because of its overall calm, water-like feel, Aria can probably put one or two viewers to sleep at any given time.  Also, there are a few episodes which I admit didn&#039;t really stack up to a good chunk of the series, mostly around the midway point, which is a bit of a downer because the really good episodes, are really good.  <br />
<br />
Overall, the story of Aria the Natural is a story that I feel improves more on what Animation provided.  Because it doesn&#039;t solely focus on one character, there&#039;s a lot more exploration and development for everyone, detailing more aspects of the characters that we&#039;ve seen in Animation, and in the end, makes the show a much better viewing experience.  Just, if you plan on marathoning this show, try and watch only a couple episodes at a time, because after a little while, because in my experience, the show can get a little bit boring when you do 4+ all at once.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ World Building<br />
+ Focused on encapsulated cast <br />
+ Provides other stories aside from daily life<br />
+ Very calming show<br />
-  Calming factor can get a bit boring.  (I would suggest only watching 3-4 at once, especially during the midway point of the series.)<br />
<br />
Characters (8.49/10): The cast for Aria the Natural doesn&#039;t really change all that much in the grand scheme of things.  All the characters that you see in Aria the Animation successfully cross over to Natural seamlessly, so there&#039;s no point in me naming them off.  Contrary to Animation though, the characters who aren&#039;t named Akari definitely do get more than they did originally.<br />
<br />
As I had mentioned before, Natural gives almost all of the characters a fair opportunity.  The side characters that possess other career paths aside from Undine (Akatsuki, Woody, Al, etc.) now get more detail to them as people and a bit more explanation as to what kind of people they were like before.  More characters got more screentime, and because of the way it was done, the show benefits it significantly.<br />
<br />
Most importantly are the other two main characters Aika and Alice, the other two apprentice gondola drivers that Akari very often spends time with.  These two are the most impacted in the series because not only do they get more development, they get entire episodes, small mini-arcs to themselves, which puts them on the same level as our main protagonist, Akari.  <br />
<br />
In addition to these characters, we do get a few side characters here and there that for the most part, remain unnamed and sort of add to the perspective episode they&#039;re in.  Of course, they mainly serve as plot devices, but they do help create some decent episodes, most of the time.  <br />
<br />
Overall, the characters in Aria the Natural are MUCH different than the characters we knew back in Aria the Animation.  My one complaint about the characters in the first season was the fact that they were for the most part, one-note without much substance to them.  Now because most of them have backstories, character development, and more than one side/trait to them, the cast feels a lot more vibrant and gives a much more enjoyable viewing experience.  Though I would still like an explanation to the whole supernatural people, cause that...kinda confuses me.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Character development for practically the whole cast<br />
+ Character backstories for some of them<br />
+ Main cast no longer feels one-noted<br />
-  Supernatural characters are a bit of a mystery (even more than they should be)<br />
<br />
Art and Sound (8.07/10 and 8.84/10): The art for Natural stays pretty much the same as what Animation showcased with little to no change, which was a very unique artstyle that really put emphasis on the backgrounds and detail.  <br />
<br />
Everything in the show looks very serene and pleasant, with nothing really standing out art-wise, but rather have everything altogether look consistent and the same.  As a result of this, the whole show is on an even level of quality, which does tally up a positive for this show.  In addition, the show brings back the comedic &quot;second faces&quot; of the characters, the facial expression that every character makes whenever they make a funny remark, or a comedic moment happens, this time, giving EVERYONE a second face which I felt was a nice touch.<br />
<br />
On the downside however, there were a few details which I found to be a bit disappointing.  Occasionally, the show does have a few art errors, distorting the characters faces slightly, making them look a bit odd.  (I.E. smaller eyes, off-center hair, bigger head)  It&#039;s not a major detail because it doesn&#039;t happen all that often, but whenever it does come up, it&#039;s relatively obvious.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack for Natural is beautiful.  With a new OP and ED (The OP &quot;Euphoria&quot; my favorite of the new tracks), Natural also plays the Aria OST tracks whenever possible, using about 4-5 songs in different instruments to play them, having one different track for every kind of mood in which the show brings.  In addition, for a couple episodes, the show brings back the original OP and ED which was used back in Animation, &quot;Undine&quot; and &quot;Rainbow&quot;, which in my opinion, was some of the best music that was made for the Aria series period.  In short, the Aria soundtrack only benefitted from what Natural added, and this is a soundtrack that I could honestly listen to everyday because of just how beautiful and serene it is.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Art style stays consistent and looks great<br />
+ Comedic second faces (I find these to be hilarious, seriously.)<br />
+ FANTASTIC OST<br />
-  A few art errors here and there<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment (8.88/10): When I started the Aria series not too long ago at the time of this review, the show really amazed me because it a series that was unique and made me understand why it was such a beloved show.  After seeing that the scores for the next few seasons only went up and up, I was curious as to why they were so much higher than the original, because usually, the original is almost always the best.  But after finishing Natural&#039;s 26 episode runtime, it all makes sense.<br />
<br />
Did I like this anime?<br />
<br />
Yes, very much so.  Not only did the second season of Aria keep true to what it was doing back in Animation, but it built up on the story, making use of its vast runtime to make an overall, better show.  The characters felt more alive, the setting was more detailed and more livelier, and the experience overall felt a lot more satisfying.<br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I like about this anime?<br />
<br />
There were aspects of this show I didn&#039;t like, primarily the somewhat slow midway section because those episodes really didn&#039;t interest me all that much.  It was mostly during the beginning and the ending episodes which I felt was the place that Natural really shined in.  In addition, the supernatural aspect that this show weaved into itself kinda confused me (and admittedly, terrified me a bit.)  This is mostly because the show went a completely different turn and delved into something that to me, didn&#039;t really fit Aria all that well.  In a sense, it was good, because it added another aspect of the city that the show introduced back in Animation (what with the cats and all), but somehow, it didn&#039;t really feel like Aria to me.<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this anime?<br />
<br />
Aria is a series I feel like everyone should watch.  It&#039;s a revered series that is hailed as one of the best slice of life shows, and really does hold up to that title with the unique aura and feeling that it exudes when you watch this series.  That being said however, since this is a sequel series, it&#039;s required for one to watch this show after the first season, since because of the way it starts, not a lot of things will make sense if you just dive headfirst into it.  That being said though, I highly recommend watching the Aria series.  It&#039;s an experience that gives a new perspective in life and if it doesn&#039;t do that, at least a pleasant watching experience to soothe one&#039;s busy life.<br />
<br />
Overall Score: 8.71/10

    With this title audiences are presented with the continuation of the Aria series, the sequel&#039;s title being Aria: The Natural. Aria: The Animation was mainly focused upon introducing the different characters of Neo Venezia and touching lightly on its setting, whereas the Natural is centered around developing its cast, in addition to the world of Aqua itself. I believe the sequel lives up to the expectations considering the prequel&#039;s success, although it could be said that there were some significant changes which could bother some viewers.<br />
<br />
The story of Aria: the Natural is once again focused around the three young girls, Akira, Aika and Alice, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review208056">
        naturally on Neo Venezia as well. The most obvious change that I&#039;d like to address was the expansion on the supernatural elements of the show, which were left to a minimum in the prequel. Audiences actually come to realize that Aqua is actually a place shrouded in mystery, or at least in some parts, which personally came as a pleasant touch to the series. This is because it serves to expand on its setting, albeit small, which was left rather unexplored in the prequel. However, there was a little issue with the supernatural elements, in particular the case of Cait Sith - who seemed way too protective concerning Akari.<br />
<br />
It also shows some flashbacks of people&#039;s past, neither dramatic or glorious, just simple daily situations, yet portrayed magnificently. It also shows the town and its habitants in a simple manner, how they work, and so another day goes by. There was a small arc in which the affection of a material object was shown, and this felt a bit too overly dramatic to my liking, even though considering the emotional value it had for the person in question.<br />
<br />
Moving on to the characters, audiences are shown the cast these were familiar with in Aria: the animation, yet with a welcoming change: now actual character development takes place. Viewers contemplate its cast experience more emotions than just happiness: fear, anger, sadness as well as anxiety are shown. Another aspect to note is the maturing of the girls personality wise; this doesn&#039;t imply that the show is less relaxing than the first. In fact, it enhances the overall story significantly, as these cast aside their same behaviour throughout the series.<br />
<br />
Other aspect to consider is the fleshing out of its supporting cast, giving viewers a slight insight into their past, as well as developing the supernatural elements of the city, such as the mysterious cats that were lightly hinted upon in the prequel. Concerning the different interactions present with its cast and citizens, these were once again charming and heartwarming, as well relatable for some instances. This is the case for example Alice playing simple games anyone might have done in their childhood, such as trying to reach home only by treading on the shadows, or kicking a stone all the way.<br />
<br />
The art style of the series remain the same as in Aria: the Animation, possessing great backgrounds as well as character designs, which both are a pleasant sight to behold. Surely enough, the animation itself is fluid, which is also applies to different facial expressions of the cast, conveying the state of the characters. As for the music score, audiences will find themselves once again pleasantly rewarded with similar types of compositions, befitting of the relaxing feeling the anime tries to convey. Piano, vocals and the likes are once again present, with nice openings as well as endings, all reminiscent of the previous title.<br />
<br />
Overall Aria: the Natural was once more a relaxing watch which maintained the quality of the previous, whilst focusing on the expansion of the supernatural aspect, or rather, the world of Aqua itself. This created a nice contrast to the previous season, which made it possible for me personally be equally entertained as the prequel. It had some things I disliked personally, yet these were easily overshadowed by its strengths. Anyhow, it is highly recommended for viewers who enjoyed the first season, yet for those who didn&#039;t, would probably better stay away from it.<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading.

    I sometimes get depressed about my life being nowhere as enjoyable as any of the characters in this show.<br />
Oh well.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
Life of Akari and friends as they discover Neo-Venezia. Meh.<br />
The one thing I noticed is that for a place which has seasons twice as long, and for a pace which goes like an old woman on stilts (not that I&#039;m complaining), the seasons go by awfully fast. Plus the characters don&#039;t seem to grow much, especially considering they&#039;re in the latter puberty stages.<br />
Still, that&#039;s a minor flaw if you consider the episodic nature of things this is meant to be taken as, and each episode&#039;s story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6291">
        is very well done, interesting, and never fails to leave a smile on your face. It&#039;s...therapeutic, the way it lifts your spirits.<br />
Which is where this anime hits it off with everyone.<br />
Plus it never gets boring.<br />
<br />
ART<br />
Ugh.<br />
It&#039;s never pleasant with the onset of QUALITY. Especially coming from a studio you&#039;d never expect to have quality issues with.<br />
Lots of times I find myself facepalming at inappropriately placed features which make the faces all weird. Seriously, focusing your attention on the background detail (which is excellently drawn by the way) is fine, but not when you&#039;re doing it at the expense of the characters in the middle of the screen, and especially not in the face, of all the areas you can mess up in.<br />
At least they didn&#039;t mess up anything else.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
As charming and elegant as the first season. The insert songs are rather unimpressive this time round though.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER<br />
<br />
There&#039;s plenty more depth to the characters than the first season. Akari&#039;s friends, Aika and Alice, have plenty of time devoted to them this time round, and it is heartwarming to see them mature from setbacks and become a better person. Akari, our main character-cum-Goddess, is as usual being honest, enthusiastic, and an angel that opens the heart of every person she comes across, though as the season progresses one starts to worry for her mental well-being, as she keeps delving into bizarre or simply out-of-whack incidents which baffle her friends. And there&#039;s also a couple more tidbits on their Prima teachers, and a few other side characters.<br />
Also, the filler characters that pop up for story of the day are all well fleshed out, and never flat.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
I love it. Love it, love it, love it. Can&#039;t love it enough. The atmosphere, the story, the interactions, the music, the episodes (except for a particular genderswap episode...that was traumatising &amp;gt;_&amp;gt;), everything was beautiful.<br />
<br />
OVERALL<br />
As per above. If you aren&#039;t too bothered by the QUALITY, you&#039;ll love this. Relaxing animu is beautifully relaxing.

    If thinking of Natural as the direct sequel of the series, then it would be quite right to say it lays grounds for many pivotal events. When thinking of Natural separated from the main franchise it lacks strong foreground for most to make sense of it. Yet, it&#039;s probably what made the series successful. (Aria the Natural that is)<br />
<br />
The story is quite much like the previous one. Without too much introductory the characters return and maintain the slow flow of time. The monotonous yet relaxing mood is kept throughout every episode. Yet, this is also where most of the mysterious elements of the series plays

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25107">
        in. This sequel to Aria the Animation is far more linked to it&#039;s slice of life genre. Making each episode well... More episodic! Every episode being a new day and a new experience, much like the first season, but with fewer characters that needed to be revealed. This is also when most of the background experiences and events are told. Explaining and gradually filling in the gaps for this series. At the same time while keeping the light mood and maintaining the right balance of certain moments, Natural dives into the world of Aqua, far deeper than any of the seasons. Exploring and showing the smallest to biggest of the world the series portrays. Also, quite a nice touch was added in. Not to be too blunt but, another VERY interesting cat is brought to the forefront and is pivotal to Akari&#039;s character development.<br />
<br />
The animation kept it&#039;s light and cool colours throughout the summer scenes and added very few warm colours in the colder part of the series. Along with that, the colours and textures are slightly smoother than Aria the Animation, which is nothing bad; only a simple observation. One must wonder if the budget for animation was slightly decreased, due to the more rounder and less emphasized characters. Nonetheless, it&#039;s not very noticeable. City animation and other secondary character designs remain very interesting and the city scenes are stunning. With the careful attention paid to keep awkward animation at minimal the animation is, while not as magnificent as it&#039;s predecessor Aria the Animation, it very much remains a very strong aspect of the series.<br />
<br />
With soothing and flowing music, it is the key difference between it&#039;s animated self and manga version. Without music to enhance the dramatic mood, or lighten it aria would not have been the same. Key scenes involving the main characters are amplified simply by music. Keeping the steady flow of dynamic and smooth music, the light part of the sound track is one of the best in the franchise, if not THE best. If this group does any more music for a series I would certainly immediately watch it. Continue the good work Choro Club.<br />
<br />
If one were to watch this series for fast paced and ecchi characters. GTFO. These characters are some of the best I&#039;ve seen develop. Each character throughout the series exploring her faults or learning something new. While at the same time the friendship would link back to Akari. The bonds between friends and instructor being near non-existent, and slight romance here and there. The silly, light hearted, and lovable characters help guide the viewer through the city of Neo-Venezia and enjoy watching the scenery and the voices speaking. The voice actors maintain their excellence and no doubt would continue to do so. The emotion displayed by the characters range from stoic, confused, to embarrassed, making this a giant mixing pot of goodness.<br />
<br />
While not filling every niche available, Aria the Natural certainly fulfilled the enjoyment factor for those that liked the previous series. This is the most entertaining (happy wise) as a direct sequel of Animation, but as a predecessor of Origination it&#039;s slightly overshadowed. It&#039;s still a barrel of laughs and a would certainly put a smile on one&#039;s face<br />
<br />
While being sometimes overlooked, Aria the Natural is probably the key to the entire franchises success. Without it, there franchise would be lacking in background events and playful memories. It showed the background and setting better than both Animation AND Origination. Making the city alive and a driving force in the series. Aria the Natural is almost like the back-story, or setting of the franchise. Overall important and a great part of Aria.<br />
<br />
HAHI!<br />

    Aria is for me the greatest folklore tale of anime, this is absolutely relaxing and the characters fit great for that concept.<br />
You&#039;ll find sometimes huge creature like Cath Sith, more swag than Spartacus, this guy make yours ovaries crackles until the end. I love the fact that series looks like to Galaxy 999, there&#039;s train flying in the sky after all.<br />
The female cast is amazing, Akari is really moe sweetheart, she&#039;s the most interesting after Alice in my opinion. All characters has her defined personalities and projects ondines training.<br />
The palette color is the best part, according to a Neo Venezia, your eyes will be dazzled

          <span style="display: none;" id="review136327">
        by that creativity of this new world.<br />
But wait to see Aria the Origination for the evolution of all these elements.

    So....Aria the Natural..Is it me or does it sound like a cheesy title taken straight outta Pornhub?Like Pink haired natural titties etc etc?<br />
<br />
But unlike the porn movie this has...Not so many things going for it i&#039;m afraid.In fact after i saw the 1st season i was so bored out of my mind and pissed off at myself for watching something as lifeless as Kim Kardashian that i stopped watching anime off all kinds for 1 month or so.But i have a finishing fetish so i was bound to come back and see the rest of the series..And sure enough here i am trying to decipher

          <span style="display: none;" id="review268825">
        that phenomenon called Aria.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re not too bored check my 1st season review..I really couldn&#039;t understand the appeal of this anime.I was dumpfounded by the fact that this was such a big hit that it continued on and on for 2 more fucking seasons.It wasn&#039;t anything special,the story wasn&#039;t something written by the goddess of poetry..So what in the name of all that&#039;s holy possesed Japan to make this a success..Wwwwweeeeeellllll it&#039;s the moe disease.If any anime has moe in it that&#039;s it as far as some fellow anime fans are concerned.Has it got moe girls making cute noises and stupid as fuck things?It&#039;s a great anime..Has it got moe animals that make stupid noises and act like someone fed them 2 bags of LSD?It&#039;s a great anime and deserves a religion of its&#039; own.<br />
<br />
Cause other than the fact that it&#039;s moe i cannot possibly find a reason for this being such a big hit.Sure many people say that it&#039;s a slice of life so what did i expect?SOME SIGNS OF LIFE DAMN IT.Something to make me go wow this is the shit.Moe isn&#039;t the be all end all.<br />
<br />
So what did they do with this 2nd installment?Did they improve it?Yes and no.You see the first one was some kind of intro for us to learn about Neo-Venezia and who the characters are.I want this to sink in before i go on..13 eps of intro..So they made a 2nd one to explore the rest of this world...So let me get this right..They couldn&#039;t do that in,say,the 1st one?Was it so jammed packed with many many things that exploring a fraction of this world was out of the question?No...Not even slightly..Anime is a bussiness after all they saw the hordes of moe lovers coming and wanted to rob them of their money and dignity.If i were them i&#039;d do the same thing.It&#039;s easy money after all.<br />
<br />
Anywho,like i said this season is more..26 eps more to be exact.But as far as i can tell this could easily be half the bulk because half the eps are spent making you watch the same things again and again.Many things that you saw in the 1st season or even things that you see in this season are being recycled.But at least some of the eps have some good things going on as well.We get some development from the characters and some nice-ish moments.Then again we have some supernatural shit going on which make no sense at all and aren&#039;t being explained..Nobody is even bothered by the fact that a huge cat is capable of using magic to exclude humans from their cat meetings..And sure enough Alicia is still going &quot;My my my&quot; all the time which makes me want to punch a hole through my pc&#039;s screen and Aika going &quot;no sappy lines allowed&quot; all the time..Recycling is a good thing..If we&#039;re talking garbage but when talking anime..No sorry i won&#039;t have that.That there is a prime example of how shitty this anime is.Recycled ideas,characters that know how to say one line only and the same &quot;comedic&quot; moments they show us for the entirety of this show.<br />
<br />
Sticking with the characters..Once again there are 4 of them.1 pinked hair gal who is is the new employee with dreams,the blonde hair who is the kind boss and says mymymy like ALOT,the blue haired gal who is the friend of the pinked haired who works for another company and last but least the green haired girl is some kind of wonder gal.The cat is like Pikachu but fatter. <br />
<br />
Animation was the same as the 1st season&#039;s.Very nice depiction of the world of Neo-Venezia and still some weird CG moments that clash with the rest of the traditional animation.<br />
<br />
Soundwise it&#039;s pink and fluffy and VAs are good and deliver their parts.<br />
<br />
So aside from some new and fresh ideas that were very good indeed the rest of the show is more or less the same stagnant crap we got from the 1st season.And i&#039;m sorry but 7 good eps from the 26 in total is not floating my goat.When i watch an anime i want it to amaze me.This made me bored and sleepy which kind of defeats the purpose of entertainment.Unless you count sleep as entertaining.

     This series for me wasn&#039;t so much of a sequel, but more of a natural progression of the original. Due to the relaxed nature of the first, it simply continues where ARIA the  Animation left off and lets us even further into its world. <br />
<br />
As far as characters go, there is a one new introduction to be made and futher development into a few others, particularly those of the Prima Undines and Grandma.<br />
<br />
Other than that though, most of the series feels like an extenion of the first one, which really makes for a wonderful series when you think on it!

    (This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)<br />
<br />
[Synopsis]:  In the city of Neo-Venezia on the planet Aqua, once known as Mars before being terraformed, Mizunashi Akari (Hazuki, Erino) works as an Undine under the Aria Company – a professional gondolier who ferries the citizens of Neo-Venezia as well as tourists through the city’s many waterways. Though only a fledgling Undine, Akari and her friends Aika (Saito, Chiwa) and Alice (Hirohashi, Ryou) have high aspirations of one day becoming as accomplished as their respective teachers, known as the Three Water Fairies of Neo-Venezia. Aria The Natural takes off right where Aria The Animation left

          <span style="display: none;" id="review197509">
        off and in much the same way it explores the city of Neo-Venezia through the interactions of Akari and her friends.<br />
<br />
[Characters]:<br />
<br />
Something that I felt was lacking in the previous season of the show in respect to the main trio of girls was character depth – nothing so grand as intricate character development but rather I felt the characters needed a greater number of traits in order to better individualize each character and more importantly make them more compelling and enjoyable. In this, I am happy to report that Aria The Natural does a great job in fleshing out the characters we initially grew to know in the first season and while hardly any of them go through true long-standing character development, the additional attention to some characters and insight into their personalities was a major strength of the show brought on by this season.<br />
<br />
Our protagonist Akari is definitely the least changed of the three girls however she also had the most going for her to begin with and so the show does not suffer in this way. Her cheery attitude and constant wonderment are kept consistent throughout the season and her characterization still works wonderfully alongside the tone of the show. While there is still plenty of Akari to go around and plenty of Akari-centric episodes I feel that the show’s occasional departure from her being the absolute center of events was a pleasurable change of pace and perspective as this approach allowed for other characters to take center stage and become more elaborate.<br />
<br />
Aika undeniably benefited the most from this season’s branching out. While she closely emulated Akira’s prohibitive tendencies and felt unique within the three apprentice Undines she was a bit hard to pin down as she lacked a sufficient number of character traits with which to identify or empathize with. Aria The Natural does a great job exploring more of Aika and rectifies one of her problems from the first season which was lack of screen time; by the end of the season I felt far more familiar with her personality and the small handful of episodes dedicated to her did wonders for her characterization. After the events of this season Aika will certainty be one of the more enjoyable characters going forward.<br />
<br />
Alice also was granted more screen time and episodic attention this season though I would say that she ultimately benefited less than Aika from this season and could stand to be elaborated upon just a bit more. Despite this I think she still walks away a much better character from this season and continues to be one of the highlights of the show for me personally. What appeared as an initially dismissed character trait within the first season is returned to at greater length this time around – to the point that the episode that expounds upon this is one of the best in the entire season.<br />
<br />
Shoring up the characters with a few added traits and developments helped keep things more interesting this time around and while they didn’t develop immensely, they did change in subtle ways as they came into new ideas and realizations and this felt like enough for both them and the show.<br />
<br />
[Art/Animation]:<br />
<br />
The art remains unchanged from the first season and so viewers will love or hate each aesthetic element for much the same reason. The scenery and setting are once again beautiful in their art and execution and support the show alongside the soundtrack fantastically. The opening sequences of each episode do a good job of introducing the show each time and their dynamic appearance helps keep them interesting.<br />
<br />
[Story]:<br />
<br />
Aria The Natural goes about its business in a familiar way to that of the first season however had a slew of improvements over the previous formula while maintaining what made the original show enjoyable. The length of the season helped the show in that it allowed it to uphold its previously established slow and relaxing pace while more frequently featuring episodes of some ‘consequence’ where the tone shifted slightly or where the focus of the episode was on someone other than Akari and her encounters.<br />
<br />
One of the major strengths of this season was how a handful of episodes shifted to more of a melancholy tone which gave the show some much needed diversity beyond its raw, over-the-top optimism. There is certainly a place for this within the show and it is very much Aria’s primary goal to support this theme however the added range of emotion was a significant improvement and something that this season features over the prior. These kinds of episodes offered the most in the way of character insight and world exploration and were generally the highlights of the show with a few exceptions.<br />
<br />
While i wouldn’t say that the show was more ‘comical’ this time around, I felt that the exchanges and comedic remarks were more on point in Aria The Natural – they were generally funnier and more enjoyable perhaps having already established many of the catchphrases and typical reactions during the first season. Though I was not a huge fan of the more supernatural elements of the show furthered by this season I will concede that they were well incorporated into both the pacing and the tone of the show.<br />
<br />
[Music]:<br />
<br />
Much like the art and animation of the show the music remains pretty much unchanged from the first season and is a strong element of the show for the same reasons. Again the music blended well with the atmosphere and attitude of the show to present a soothing setting in which the events of the show transpired.<br />
<br />
[Final Thoughts and Rating]: <br />
<br />
Aria The Natural was, in my opinion, a step up from the first season in how it further explained and defined its main characters and because it introduced more interesting themes intermittently while upholding what the show did well in in the first place. While I didn’t feel enthralled by each and every episode, the show had strong high points which kept me watching above all else – the show’s ability to deliver the occasional highly emotional or compelling episode was far better this season and the first reason I would cite as to this season’s improvements and superiority over the prior.<br />
<br />
Rating: 7<br />
<br />
I gave Aria The Natural a 7 because the show took what was done in Aria The Animation and expanded upon it successfully, adding things such as characterization and additional themes which I had previously felt the show was wanting. Given the show’s 26 episodes I occasionally felt a little bored by the proceedings however the show seemed to know just when to throw in an especially good episode to pick me back up and so while the season dragged occasionally it was never for long and the high points of the show were chiefly responsible for the show achieving the rating it did.<br />
<br />
[Recommendations]:<br />
<br />
In my previous review I cautioned those interesting in the slice of life nature of the show that it was somewhat demanding in that very little takes place and there wasn’t a great deal of appeal beyond the typical slice of life dynamic and though those reading this review have likely seen the first season I will at least say that the same caution is not necessarily this time around as this season offers much more in the areas of characters and story than its predecessor. Additionally, though I think Aria still falls short of belonging to the genre of ‘comedy’ I do think that this season was funnier and so those who may have found this quality lacking in the first season should be pleased with how the gag remarks and reactions have improved. Due to the length of the season Aria The Natural was able to postulate a good many more things than the first season and though the show hardly approaches the territory of the psychological it does present some food for thought in the way of its episodic themes and may be enjoyable to prospective viewers for this reason.

    I find it hard to write a review about a sequel that has a similar tone with the prequel. Yeah, same characters, same premises, same conflict type.<br />
<br />
But still i find this sequel is better, and i&#039;m going to tell you why soon.<br />
<br />
The first thing that i noticed about this series is the amount of the episodes. 26. Meaning it is doubled from the prequel, Aria the Animation.<br />
<br />
And yet i give it a better score, and yes, i&#039;m going to tell you why soon.<br />
<br />
Then, i browse the net, seeing about The Natural popularity and the hype about it. The Natural is not as hyped as the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review68353">
        first one.<br />
And yes, as you guess, i still give it a better score, and YES i&#039;m going to tell you why.<br />
<br />
The main story is still the same. The chronicle/adventure/ordinary life(Choose one or even, choose all of &#039;em) of Mizunashi Akari to become a great Prima Undine with Aika and Alice, continues. The difference between the Animation and Natural, is off course, the story. Natural has a better story pacing, making it easier to be absorped. <br />
<br />
The 26 episodes that seemed so long before i watch it now seems like a treasure to me. Believe it or not, the story does slap me lots of times, giving me great new dogmas and new perspectives more than Animation.<br />
<br />
Everything is compiled in a still good-looking animation that is not going to lose to the Animation, and i believe it won&#039;t let us down in the Origination.<br />
<br />
Characterization has more depth. That&#039;s not so surprising seeing the amount of the total episodes of this anime. Still, every character has it proportional portion, be it supporting character or main character<br />
<br />
One of the most supreme thing in Aria the Natural is the Sound(ONCE AGAIN).<br />
Yeah, visual is not enough, this is what makes the anime looks better than the manga version, even though the manga excels in graphical visualization.<br />
26 episodes means twice from Animation, and it mathematically should be twice the eargasm. <br />
Seemed like the sound development were very serious with this anime, because the OST of Natural has made me dozing off lots of time, especially the ED song.<br />
<br />
Finally the greatest thing is, i didn&#039;t feel ANY sleepiness when watching Natural, yet i don&#039;t feel rushed too, which is an improvement seeing how many episodes are here.<br />
Alas, watch this, and you&#039;ll find yourself once again trapped in the charm of Neo-Venezia in a bigger, better means.
