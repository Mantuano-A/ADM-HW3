    The Review has been updated to include the end of the anime. Enjoy :) <br />
<br />
As someone who has been a huge fan of the railgun/index series since the anime debuted a decade ago (yeah, I’m old as balls), you can bet that I was ecstatic at the news of both getting a continuation after so many years. However, after the shit show that was Index III, I was scared for the future of Railgun T dreading that it would receive the same horrible treatment from JC staff. Thankfully this fear was short lived when Tatsuyuki Nagai was announced to be continuing his duties as director

          <span style="display: none;" id="review329693">
        of the Railgun series. Railgun T has lived up to and exceeded the expectations of its predecessors Railgun and Railgun S as it takes everything that made the Railgun series amazing and turns it up to 11. <br />
<br />
After 6 and a half years of waiting, the electric tsundere herself, Misaka Mikoto, is back with the gang, starting the Daihaseisai festival. As per the customary tradition, Misaka got one hell of a bad ass entrance in the first episode, Shirai is up to her normal pervertedness, Uiharu is the same old resident judgement tech and Saten is the usual sucker for her academy city conspiracy theories. Nothing has changed, and that’s how it should be. This simple formula, alongside fantastic voice acting and art/animation, is what allows Railgun T to stand out from the rest and to continue to do so. Plus, they hype is real as the man, the myth, and the legend, Sogiita Gunha has finally made his appearance, and he is ready to spread the important of true GUTS to all those in Academy City. <br />
<br />
The Daihaseiai arc was absolutely fantastic to say the least. The intense emotions portrayed by each of the characters and their motivations were spot on, and the hype surrounding the level 6 shift was delivered upon quite well culminating into a hyped up battle that delivered. It&#039;s just a fantastic adaptation that is pretty faithful to the source material, meaning that us fans can greatly enjoy it, and brings the flair of the old J.C. Staff to round everything up so that others who recently hopped aboard the Railgun train can also continue to enjoy the series. Plus, it is also quite refreshing to see some of the other characters like Kongo finally getting some well-deserved screen time. Following the Daihaseiai arc, given how utterly fantastic it was, was definitely no small task, however, J.C. Staff was up to it as the Dream Ranker arc was just as fantastic. It was pretty faithful to the source material, and therefore was one enjoyable ride with a few good, and I mean good, laughs along the way (thanks Blau you beautiful human). Essentially, what I am trying to say is that Railgun T succeeded, and by this I mean it was absolutely amazing. It had completely blew my expectations out of the water and if you haven’t started watching it yet, get to it, you are missing out as was damn good. <br />
<br />
The quality of the art and animation was leaps and bounds better than I would’ve expected from the now established professional PowerPoint slide company known as JC Staff. I have a feeling that we can thank a large part of it being due to Tatsuyuki Nagai, but, in the end, what’s important is that things were very promising in the art and animation department for this season. The fight scenes looked amazing, simple character movements were well animated and the characters are well drawn and look good (I’m looking at you Shokuhou Misaki ;), my queen). The higher levels of Sakuga in the opening is just a small tidbit of the superb job JC staff is doing animating this fantastic series. <br />
<br />
Also, I didn’t think any opening could be better than Sister’s Noise, but here I am looking like an idiot both openings were off the charts good. <br />
<br />
J.C. Staff, given all the hate they deservingly get in regards to their last few years of delivering very sub-par anime adaptations, has done a wonderful job with adapting this anime and easily deserves my 10/10 score for this adaptation. <br />
<br />
A final note for you all: as Sogiita Gunha would say, “OVERCOME EVERYTHING WITH GUTS!!!” and let’s enjoy another season of Railgun :) <br />

    The idea of Railgun getting another anime adaptation is more than a blessing. Despite the 7 long years of waiting, we are once again greeted by another installation of the Raildex franchise. Being a spinoff of the original Index series, Railgun is no pushover when it comes to being a show of its own identity. Based on the manga, Railgun T is a breakout show of 2020.<br />
<br />
Without further ado, we are reintroduced to Misaka Mikoto, the level 5 Esper, aka the Railgun of Academy City. She’s still the electrifying Misaka we all know from the previous seasons so don’t much expect change about her character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357394">
        this season. She’s already an established character and at this point really needs no more character development. However, Academy City itself is constantly changing every day and there are events that influences the city greatly. One such event is the Daihasaei Sports Festival, a chance for the city’s citizens to compete in friendly competition. The level 5 espers are appointed as representatives although the event itself gets chaotic. Misaka plays the role of not an enforcer but as a protector. It serves her right as someone who genuinely cares about the welfare of the city. Similarly, she is devoted to protect her friends from the darkness of Academy City. That’s the Railgun we all came to know from day one.<br />
<br />
The darkness in Academy City never ceases to disappear and in this season, you’ll witness plenty the machinations from the science side. Misaka gets entangled once again into a deeper conspiracy that also involves Level 5 Esper, Shokuhou Misaki. These two never really see eye to eye but in this season, the two become unlikely allies to solve a bigger mystery. The season’s storytelling ties in together all the themes of the franchise and with Misaka and Misaki working together, they discover some unsettling revelations. One of the biggest projects of Academy City still revolves around the Misaka network and the concept of an esper to reach level 6. Misaka herself unknowingly becomes a catalyst after her emotions boiled up. It allowed the scientist Gensei to take advantage and trigger her powers even against her will. We also have to understand that level 6 itself is more than a power level but rather representing the divine state. What Gensei is trying to achieve goes beyond the realm of a human ability. But luckily, we have certain characters disrupting his dark dreams. If there’s anything viewers can learn from the Railgun franchise is that while there’s darkness, there’s also light. The light represents characters such as Touma, level 5 esper Gunha, and even Misaki. <br />
<br />
The heavy drama aside, this season also has its ways to find fun and that includes pairing up certain characters together. Almost like fate, Touma encounters Saten for the first time and they bond over something simple as a good luck charm. Later on in the show, Saten also makes friends with Frenda, and despite their short time together, they form a formidable team. Misaka herself learns the importance of having friends and that the bonds they form is stronger than any esper power. Because let’s face it, one of Railgun’s prominent theme is friendship and ways for characters to connect with each other no matter how different they are. Whether it’s Misaka and her circle of friends or fellow espers, every episode shows that bonds are important. The more I watched this season, the more I see the direction of the story, one in which it always finds its ways to be truthful with its themes.<br />
<br />
Consisting of two different arcs, the second half of Railgun introduces the Dream Ranker Arc with the concept of Indian Poker. It is a type of technology that can record dreams with individuals being able to experience them in the shape of cards. The creator, Kuriba Ryouko, is an intelligent girl who managed to create such technology. And as you can imagine, Indian Poker can be deadly when used in the wrong hands. In the right hands however, it can also be a helpful tool for characters such as Kuroko to protect Academy City’s citizens. <br />
<br />
With a full 2-cour of 25 episodes, I’m very pleased to see how polished this season came to be. From the very first episodes, it knew what the audience wanted and wasted no time to get to the meat of the story. Focusing on the science side also gives an in-depth look at the lives of different espers, some who live like normal folks, while others engage in dangerous experiments. Ryoko is one such example where she even makes a clone of herself to achieve her goals. It goes on to say that some espers are willing to do anything regardless of the risk at hand. Misaka knows the dangers of experiments as she herself had been a subject to them. By fighting against the darkness of Academy City, she does her best to make their society a better place for everyone. <br />
<br />
Watching Railgun T taught me that spinoffs can work wonders with the right set of characters, storytelling, themes, and overall selling itself as what it is. Since its previous seasons, we have an established cast with a poster girl who can be relatable in many ways. From the two main story arcs of this season, we learned even more about the science side of Academy City. It’s spinoffs like Railgun that serves as an example to be great on its own. It doesn’t need to be carried by its main show and in fact, I’d say with easy confidence that this season is a must watch for any fan of the Raildex universe.

    Have you ever seen yourself in a scenario where you take the likings of the sidekick instead of the main character? Where you’re more hooked into the story and whereabouts of a secondary figure in the show instead of whoever plays the lead?<br />
Certainly, it has happened to all of us at least once in our lifetime and, if you are this deep into this series, it’s obvious that it’s not your first time experiencing this, as we all know what has to be known: Misaka Mikoto is the real deal.<br />
<br />
After 7 years of drought, the third installment of the series premiered in January and neither

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357393">
        the tremendous drop in production quality observed in JC Staff during the past few years (essentially taking Index III into consideration) nor an enormous hiatus due to a global pandemic could stop Railgun T to deliver.<br />
The third season continues the story in a time where the Daihaisei Festival has begun, focusing as is customary by now, on the “Ace of Tokiwadai”: the one and only Misaka Mikoto, as Misaka and her friends dive deeper into the dark side of Academy City (A.C. for short), facing all kind of dangerous situations where, consequently, both the future of A.C. and their lives are at stake. <br />
<br />
Railgun T continues with a storyline loaded with a repertoire of dark, powerful metaphysical and moral symbolism (as it was in the Sisters’ arc) but without backtracking in its goofiness and light-hearted characteristics which has made this show so enjoyable and “easy to watch” during the past years. In addition, when we add the action-packed philosophy that the Railgun franchise has had for the majority of its existence, as well as its quirky and free-spirited pace, we come up with the perfect formula that have given them great recognition over the past couple of years -taking out of the picture that Silent Party arc which was dreadful enough to leave us a sour taste for a bunch of years- and has helped the storyline of the series to get better and better with each season, making a clearer bigger picture of the Toaru universe, especially the scientific one, a.k.a, the one related to Misaka Mikoto and her endeavours.<br />
<br />
Speaking about symbolism, Railgun never ceases to amaze me on how they’ve been able to both keep posing topics laden with meaning during the past few years and build on these topics to create an interesting and enlightening story; topics like the true meaning of humanism, the onto-epistemological dualism of body and soul or the paradigm of “the end justify the means”, all this while tempering the impact of their message, taking into consideration there position as a light-hearted show.<br />
<br />
What I would like to point out is the subtle difference I’ve noticed in the development of the story, especially throughout the first course of the season. Up until now, I had not seen a particular interest in the writers on trying to make things a little bit more intriguing, nonetheless, this season had a more courageous approach, as they used plot devices such as foreshadowing, making a fool of the viewer (e.g: letting us  think that &lt;x&gt; or &lt;y&gt; had good or bad intentions intentionally when it was the other way round) or plot twisting, making the viewer much more attached to the evolution of the story and the characters which participate in it, what, in my opinion, are enough facts to affirm that their storytelling has been taken to a whole nother level. <br />
<br />
Another thing that this season has done great is in displaying contrasts properly. Let me explain. Do you realise how difficult is it to mesh two characters that are THAT different (Misaka and Shokuhou) and make them complement each other properly so that the series can go on? And I’m not speaking about power-related complementation, which is quite the easy task -I mean, they’re both Level 5 espers, it can’t be that difficult-, I’m talking about the fact that season T mainly revolves around their interaction, around their synergy -which, by the way, brings a little of life to the anime-, in spite of the circumstance that these two have wildly conflicting origins, personality and history. As a matter of fact, they create a proceeding where Shokuhou has no choice but to place enough trust on Mikoto in order to be able to tell her some of her secrets and indirectly ask Misaka for help. <br />
As a result, we’ve all been witness to a much more organic show, something that was lacking on preceding jobs related to the Toaru universe, which felt much more systematic, somehow more worried on adapting correctly the source material instead of worrying on making a good, complete, entertaining show.<br />
<br />
The main cast was as great as ever: Misaka being as badass as she has accustomed us, Kuroko not being as tiring as she is thanks to the notable decrease in “Onee-sama rants” and Saten being her usual self, giving a different point of view in a group so plunged into an atmosphere os esper powers that sometimes forget to live an “joyful, ordinary life”.<br />
Additionally, let’s not forget about the coherent characterisation -at least for once- of side characters such as Kongo, Frenda, the Scavenger crew or even Shokuhou, giving them the proper screen-time and character development, leading to a much more complete series that uses its not-so-valuable characters for something more that comic relief gags (full-time job of Kongo-san until this season) or &quot;damsel in distress&quot; situations for the main cast to shine with their craftiness and might.<br />
<br />
Backtracking a little bit, speaking about production and animation quality and knowing what studio was in charge of this season (as it was in s1 &amp; s2), I am quite sure I wasn’t the only one who was in fear of yet again another disappointment after the embarrassing position in which the JC Staff crew have put themselves during the last few years (with magnificent works such as Index III, OPM s2 or the lately Accelerator powerpoint presentation which, as a matter of fact, was alright due to the fact that both Accel.’s character and voice actor are god-tier); however, it’s rather obvious that even JC Staff knows how important the Railgun franchise is for their survival. It&#039;s pretty clear that, due to its popularity in Japan and in the Occidental world, the studio has in mind that they are pretty much obliged to get it right, as Toaru Kagaku no Railgun is their spearhead in today’s highly competitive anime-production environment.<br />
For that reason, JC Staff has made sure that the quality of the animation in Railgun T is off the charts, especially taking into account the expectations before the series began airing, knowing all the problems they faced with this anime due to production and pandemic reasons. Fluidity and choreography looked amazing -especially during fight scenes-, sakuga animation was carried out amazingly well (for instance, both openings and that episode 14 climax was just top-notch artwork), camera rotations and 3D movements were executed to perfection, backgrounds were depicted amazingly well, characters were drawn great...hell, even the use of CGI wasn’t creaky at all and led to one of the best animation scenes of the entire series! <br />
<br />
By the same token, music has had a leading role in the success of this season. The sound director has done a marvelous job in both the composition -even though some tracks are not new- and the use of music throughout the season, enhancing the different emotions that were on display during different moments, whether it was hyping up the moment when a fight was taking place, magnifying the sense of urgency, intensifying the feeling of anguish...yet, one of the best part of this music section was in both the Openings and Endings (having the first OP in mind while writing this), as fripSide delivers yet again with that “final phase” banger.<br />
<br />
Guys, spin-off’s work, and this is a good example of it; Railgun T comes up with a great mix of symbolism, light-hearted moments, great characterisation and action-packed eye-catching sequences that will not cease to amaze you during the whole course of the series; so if you’re not watching Railgun yet...WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?<br />

    Preface: A Certain Scientific Railgun has always been JC Staff’s favorite and most profitable series to adapt, the bias is quite real and very noticeable when any season of Railgun is compared to a season of Index or the new Accelerator anime. As expected, despite all the failures JC Staff recently had and even with the global pandemic that occurred while this was airing, Railgun T is still by far the single best thing made by JC Staff in years, not counting movies. This review will expand on why the anime adapt for Railgun T blows the other Toaru adapts out of the water and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357399">
        what fans of the Toaru series can expect from it.<br />
<br />
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
<br />
The story for Toaru Kagaku No Railgun T is largely a page by page faithful adapt of the source material along with some of the usual head canon this specific director just can’t resist adding. The additions this time though, unlike with Nagai space in the silent party arc, did not detract from the story and even added meaningful characterization. This story takes place fairly early in the timeline of the series during the Daihasei festival in season 2 of index, and slightly after the events of the Sister’s Noise project in Railgun S. It appears that Silent Party was largely forgotten although there were passing references to Kongo launching a space shuttle into the stratosphere. The story primarily consists of 2 arcs, the first being the extremely popular Daihasei festival arc and the second being the Dream Ranker arc, both of which were adapted really well. This review won’t go into deep spoiler territory to much, but it’s worth mentioning that the Daihasei festival arc was adapted nearly perfectly. From the early games, to Kongou and her friends confronting a mercenary, and Misaka’s amazing temporary partnership with Misaki, everything was done perfectly. It did hit a few snags here and there, especially with how long the truck scene was and the recap in episode 13 which delayed the finale and made it somewhat anti-climactic. Overall, the Daihasei festival arc was a 9/10 adapt for the story and any source reader should be satisfied with how the story was brought to life.<br />
<br />
As for the dream ranker arc, it’s worth noting that the arc had a series of excellent mini arcs within it that the audience might find to be, some of the best side character highlights, and general slice of life moments animated this entire year. Kuroko’s mini arc with the precog boy had very little Misaka in it despite her being the title character, yet despite this it was an incredible arc showcasing how cool Kuroko can be when she’s not injured or infatuated with Misaka. The Bust Upper arc was absolutely hilarious, Misaka and Kinuhata fighting over the card and then teaming up together to obtain it was great, the introduction of more index characters like Hamazura was also nice for the index viewers, the references in the dream were also a nice touch. The arc with Frenda might just be my favorite Toaru side arc in general, Frenda’s cute more human side was explored and the viewers learn that Saten and her actually had interesting interactions and a friendship that did not involve the main cast. The way it was masterfully tied into the battle royale arc with the rank 2 and his team getting some exposure and the 1 week time skip was also great. The main meat of the arc itself was perfectly handled, no complaints at all on the exposition of Kuriba and the cyborg’s rationalization on why they wanted to get revenge on humanity. Misaka’s first “kill” was also handled in an impactful way, overall a 9/10 story adapt.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
<br />
Well the art isn’t bad at all and is significantly better than honestly anything else JC staff has made since Railgun S, this includes dozens of other anime aired between the 9 year wait between these 2 seasons and includes the other Toaru adapts as well. Kenichiro Aoki is the lead animation director for this season and thankfully it appears he happens to be one exceptional animator. The fight scenes actually had great choreography and strategy for example the fight between Kuroko and Mitori which involved a teleporting girl fighting a terminator rip off. The use of teleportation in such a strategic manner and figuring out how to beat a liquid metal monster was great, and the final moment between Kuroko and Mitori was definitely intense. As for the major fights, there was plenty of Sakuga, with Gunha fighting Misaka being animated so well that it could compete with shows from top studios like Bones or WIT, the detail and composition were among the best out of all shows aired in early 2020 and late 2019. <br />
<br />
The background art was reused a lot, but it doesn’t really detract from the show, if anything there is no reason to constantly remake art for the exact same setting, and it captures the feeling of the city from season 2 quite well. The character designs are also recycled but that’s fine, it’s a series with 7 installments now, there is no reason to significantly change anything. At some points the art style did noticeably look a bit dry or bland, such as the lightning effects during the end stage of Misaka’s transformation and the dragons scene, but my expectations were already set so low for JC staff that anything above CGI lightning and CGI dragons were already acceptable regardless of how they looked. <br />
<br />
Frenda fighting Rakko has some of the best fight choreography in the season the episode aired, if it was not for a certain martial arts anime airing in the same season as this arc it likely would have been the best. The fluid gunshots, explosions, and environmental damage combined with the camera angles was truly enjoyable and set the bar for fights during the summer anime season. In the dream ranker arc the iron sand kaiju was quite the spectacle, even if the kaiju and its opponent used some CGI, it was very well integrated and barely noticeable, the iron sand effects were especially beautiful. The battle between Misaka and the cyborg, leading up to the kaiju fight, was also very well executed with some of the best lightning animation in anime, and one of the best looking railgun shots from Misaka due to how perfectly drawn the impact frames were. Overall, there are no complaints about the art or the animation, both of which were top tier for all arcs this season.<br />
<br />
The sound: 8<br />
<br />
The openings for Toaru related anime are always good, no exception, the first OP did sound a bit to much like the older openings but between the lyrics and visuals it was still quite good. The soundtrack is the same as prior railgun seasons but I won’t complain about that, the OST from before was great. Sound effects have been brought back to the original ones as well which is a huge improvement over season 3 attempting to throw in all sorts of new effects that don’t match the atmosphere of the series.<br />
<br />
Characters: 9<br />
<br />
Misaka is more than just a tsundere side character and this anime perfectly illustrates how deep her character goes and her underlying motivations. We learn quite well that Misaka actually hates the city and how its run but she loves the civilians and her friends so she puts up with it despite feeling like a human lab rat. We also get to learn more about how much she cares about her friends and how easily someone as good as her can quickly turn to threaten to crush her opponents like insects if someone takes them away, Misaka might be a hero but she is a teenage girl first and foremost. Overall I quite enjoyed this new side of Misaka that was shown during her transformation and the aftermath when she comes to terms with her feelings towards the city, I also quite enjoyed her development in the dream ranker arc and her killing another being for the first time even if it was nonliving. <br />
<br />
Now the level 5s in general also got some development, we got to see an entirely new character and we also got to enjoy watching one of the fan favorites get fleshed out in the anime. As far as the new characters it’s important to mention how great Misaki was and how well she was adapted into the anime, she started off as a cold manipulative sociopath that the audience will hate, but her redemption arc was amazing. From Misaki demonstrating a lelouch level of athleticism to her backstory on why she cares about the clones and dislikes Misaka for allowing the cloning project to occur, Misaki’s character became quite fleshed out. This was a far cry from her original appearance in Railgun S where she simply came off as a bitch during the 5 min she was on screen. <br />
<br />
As for Misaka’s friend group, Kuroko is still an over the top lesbian with lots of fan service and annoying behavior, but she does keep the atmosphere light and amusing, and she definitely has her badass moments like when she fought Mitori. Kuroko is a well-rounded character and excellently complements Misaka and the gang. Saten and Uiharu are more of the usual, it was interesting seeing how Uiharu coped with knowing that she unintentionally betrayed her friends when Misaki brainwashed her, and Saten meeting a certain protagonist was hilarious as well.<br />
Saten also got a significant side arc with Frenda which explored her personal relationships more and made it clear that the characters in this series have interesting and eventful lives even outside of their teams and interactions with the protagonist. Overall the characters were excellent, as they are in the source material, the fans of the series will be glad to know that they were done justice, a solid 9/10 for characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
<br />
If you are a fan of anything Toaru related you will love this season of Railgun, if you are a fan specifically of Railgun this season might even live up to Railgun S for you. Now I wouldn’t consider it as good as the sisters noise arc, both the Daihasei and Dream Ranker arcs were equally good 9/10 arcs while Sisters Noise was a perfect 10, I believe that the consistently good arcs mean a lot and make the overall viewing experience much more enjoyable. Even if you are not a Toaru anime fan I would still recommend this anime, it has great action, visuals, characters, and a well-executed story, it is an incredibly enjoyable adapt and has redeemed JC Staff to me and hopefully to you as well.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
<br />
I give this show a 9, it was exceptional and it is absolutely worth a watch if you are a Toaru fan, I know you likely have been let down by the Index 3 or Accelerator adaptations, but you can rest assured that this specific installment will be worth watching. This is the best out of the 3 new additions to the Toaru anime franchise and hopefully it gets another season soon as I cannot wait to see what happens next.<br />

    For Index/Railgun fans who have been following since the debut of Toaru Majutsu no Index, anime or not, aren&#039;t you all excited for the new season of Railgun after literally a decade? Personally, I am not one of those people who have been following the Index series since that long time ago, however, a fan is still a fan no matter how old or new are you to the series isn&#039;t it?<br />
<br />
With that being said, J.C. Staff honestly flopped season 3 of Toaru Majutsu no Index that was released just 2 years back during 2018. And then last year came Toaru Kagaku no Accelerator, was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review329719">
        it amazing? I wouldn&#039;t say it was amazing, but it passes for an anime (barely). However, just by looking at this new season of Toaru Kagaku no Railgun really makes me wonder if the staff working at J.C. Staff are trolling with us or not since they literally proved that they can make an anime look good, sound good and most importantly, have a storyline that doesn’t feel like some thrown-away script found in the dumpster.<br />
<br />
We start off with the events that following the storyline of Index 2 which might have confused the people who haven’t actually watched the Index series which FYI is the parent story of Railgun and that Railgun is just a side-story. But thankfully the series quickly diverges away from Index and into its own set of storylines. The Daihasei Festival is about to begin, and that the committee managing it tries to find Level 5 espers for their opening ceremony speech. After getting rejected by several Level 5s, they manage to find 2 espers willing to take the job. Through this event we can roughly guess the personalities of the Level 5 espers in Academy City, a selfish and overinflated ego-like personality due to being one of only 7 Level 5 espers that lie within the city.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, we have the usual Misaka gang—Uiharu, Kuroko, Saten &amp; Misaka herself—doing the things they do best basically. Uiharu trying her best by doing her judgement work; Kuroko fantasizing about her being with Misaka; Saten doing her usual conspiracy theory thing-y; Misaka doing her usual walk around the park to beat up some level 0 thugs.<br />
Despite the story starting off pretty chill and relaxing, we are only 6 episodes in and shit has just gone down, like down down. And it really made me realize that this is what I love about Railgun, the fact that they spend the first 2-3 episodes doing a quick memory jog and world-building, give you a good amount of time to breathe and understand the city before getting into the chase. This is really what railgun really does best and allows it to stand out among the hundred other shows that are airing alongside it this season. Despite being a sequel &amp; a side-story, they still spend a considerable number of episodes doing world-building instead of getting into the action straight away, I would like to highly appreciate that.<br />
<br />
Personally, if I were to compare this to Railgun or Railgun S, I would prefer T over both of them. Not because of the debut of Misaki, although many Toaru fans have always treated Misaki like a queen, I would just have to prefer Misaka over her. Wait, hold your horses for a minute, just a minute tks. I am not ready to get flooded by comments talking about Misaki in somewhere else besides this current railgun arc, so chill out. Okay back to the topic, if I were to be frank, I really loved the openings and endings for this current season, they just feel a slight better from the previous ones although I still love every song that fripside has ever produced so it might just be because it’s a fresh song and who doesn’t love new songs?<br />
<br />
The sakuga for this series has not degraded, actually it felt like it has just gotten a notch better. Kudos to J.C. Staff for holding down their fort when it came to making the new season of Railgun since their recent productions honestly make them seem like they have just went all the way downhill. I especially loved the flying scene at the start of the opening theme, it reminds of a certain event in Railgun S where Misaka shot a railgun when she was all the way in the sky. And also that frame when Kuroko looked up, which follows up with Misaka looking down and flying down to the Earth was a nice transition that I really appreciated a lot. As a person that really appreciates openings, a bad opening equals to a bad start to an anime episode even if the episode ends up being good, a weird aftertaste will be left when I try to give the anime a score.<br />
<br />
Overall, Railgun T at this point of time doesn’t seem to be an anime that would join its other fellow Toaru friends in the trash and instead actually stand out among the other anime that are airing this season. Calling this show bad would be more than an overstatement, cause it&#039;s amazingly blinding.

    In Toaru Kagaku no Railgun T, Mikoto Misaka and her friends prepare for the Daihasei Festival, a seven-day sports competition between different Esper schools, which, of course, also include the famous Tokiwadai middle school. Misaka and all other students of Tokiwadai are highly motivated and ready to do their best in the upcoming competition. However, all the fun ends, when another dark secret of the Academy City of Science and Technology is uncovered. What is this secret?<br />
<br />
The universe of this series is tremendously huge: A Certain Magical Index, A Certain Scientific Railgun, A Certain Scientific Accelerator and many many more.  Academy City is just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357392">
        a small, yet, very important part of the story, because almost everything what happens in the anime, happens exactly in the Academy City; it is all about it, it connect everything. Long story short, as always, Toaru Kagaku no Railgun T focuses on the Academy City; the city that is more technologically developed than any country in the whole world: science and technology in the Academy City is 20, or maybe even more than 30 years more advanced than in any part of the world, which gives you an understanding of what this city is. It is an open secret that we have been finding out more and more information about the Academy City for a while now and that there will not be anything new to know about it. Such a way of thinking would be completely wrong, since the new season shows more dark secrets about it and the most important thing about it is that old questions are also being answered.<br />
<br />
As has always been the case, Toaru Kagaku no Railgun T is a dark sci-fi, fluffy SoL, a bit of this, a bit of that and, as a result, it actually works. There are just so many things going on that you might just stop for a moment and reconsider what has happened in an episode. Setting works, the attention has been paid to everything: the sci-fi elements are amazing, power system, everything. Toaru Kagaku no Railgun is one of these series that has a very average start and then, after some time, you notice that you are a fan now; the deeper you go, the more rewarding it becomes. With that being said, story wise, as mentioned above, Toaru Kagaku no Railgun T answers more questions, as well as the old ones and it makes the universe even more interesting and enjoyable to follow.<br />
<br />
Probably, the second best thing about A Certain Scientific Railgun after the storyline is animation, which meets the current standards. When looking at the picture, you just cannot take your eyes off it even for a second. Beautiful landscapes: stylish industrial skyscrapers that make the world of A Certain Scientific Railgun look like as if it were the future.  However, at the same time, all this is in a perfect harmony, with lush greenery and parks with fountains. In addition to this, the animation is also able to show facial expressions of the characters in a very unique way; they make characters look so alive. Needless to say, the animators pay enough attention to each and every small detail, which helps create the atmosphere of comfort, when viewing the anime.  However, the main appeal of this series, as always, is Japanese voice actors, who help you appreciate the series even more.<br />
<br />
Character wise, more characters are being introduced, but the most important thing to mention here is that the new season also pays more than enough attention to the old characters. What I am trying to say is that the new season both introduces new characters and also does not forget about the old ones, showing their background; there are just so many things going on, so many characters that exist in the universe of A Certain Scientific Railgun and they all want to achieve something. Even the villains have their reasons to do what they want, their ideals and desires make sense and you might even feel sorry for them. What is more, you might even ask yourself one simple question: if I were in their shoes, would I do the same thing? This is something you can only achieve with great writing, which A Certain Scientific Railgun has.<br />
<br />
All in all, as it has been mentioned already, A Certain Scientific Railgun has everything: a grain of romance, cute girls do cute things, excellent sci-fi elements, which might become a reality sometime in the future, astounding action scenes, a drama that cannot be called forced, quite the contrary, some of the scenes might make you moody. Anyways, this season is the most action packed, spectacular eye candy that you cannot and must not miss. However, if you are not a fan, then what are you doing with your life?

    Look if you like Railgun then you&#039;ll like this a lot. The story is set up well and the side characters are very well set up , they honestly have more development then some main characters in other series. CGI is still noticeable in this series but not nearly as much has past seasons, the backgrounds are still amazingly detailed and really help to show just how big the city is and of course this seasons railgun shots have looked amazing and highly detailed. The OP and ED of this season are arguably the best of the series and have a high production value to

    As a conclusion to over a decades worth of storytelling, it&#039;s got a lot to live up to, and it&#039;s about as good as you could really hope for it to be. Overall, I really do like Railgun S better. At the end of the day, Railgun S was just a wildly new experience, it was such a gamechanger and crowd-pleaser. Not only that, Railgun S I think had a better final battle. This final battle, while boasting the biggest ensemble of Railgun heroes we&#039;ve ever seen on screen, is weirdly dark and muddied in CGI scenery compared to the battle at Stadium (Final Arc

        at Railgun S). Also I hate Kuroko, she&#039;s just not that fun and annoying. Okay so those are my criticisms, what did I like about the anime? I guess everything else? The anime has a big emotional core, and a climactic end that is godamn powerful. This anime juggles a lot. Seriously this is like watching someone juggle 10 flaming chainsaws, it&#039;s a godamn miracle it works at all. That it works this well is even more of a miracle. It&#039;s an imperfect anime in 2020, but perfectly satisfying conclusion to this arc of the Index saga.<br />

    Few anime are lucky enough to get two seasons, much less a third, especially when those seasons are spread out across more than a decade&#039;s time.  There are numerous advantages to a long-form story in terms of ability to develop characters, flesh out the world, and create a complex plot, but there are as many if not more disadvantages.  It takes true skill to maintain interest in a story without haring off after half-developed ideas and winding up in the swamp of plot holes and retcons.  I&#039;m glad to say that Toaru Kagaku no Railgun T is a shining example of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357432">
        advantages of the long-form anime, taking the momentum from the former seasons without sacrificing it in the least.<br />
<br />
This season of Railgun features two rock-solid plot arcs.  The first arc is quite tightly plotted up to the point of resolution, with relatively high tension after the first few episodes set the scene and refresh us on the characters.  While the action throughout this arc is well-done, it really shines in giving enough screen time to characters like Kongo Mitsuko and Shokuhou Misaki that we&#039;ve met previously who haven&#039;t really had the time to be fully developed.  The second uses a more meandering approach to give us more time with out main cast, in a way tying three mini arcs together with some nice slice-of-life moments to build up to another satisfying climax.<br />
<br />
As before mentioned, what really makes Railgun shine at this point is the fact that it has had the time to build solid characters.  Although the series does have a relatively large cast, the series has effectively remained focused on the key characters so that personality has time to really develop.  This has especially paid off here, where finally characters are able to stand firm on their own foundations free of the gimmicks that served in place of solid character development in the cast (Kuroko and Kongo really benefit in this department, with Saten benefiting to a lesser extent.)  The villains also remain interesting, though perhaps a little less compelling than some of the villains we&#039;ve met in past seasons.<br />
<br />
One way that Railgun has facilitated this type of excellent character growth is by not always placing the characters in constant strife and battle.  These characters have real lives and personalities precisely because we get to see the moments of their everyday life.  They certainly have a propensity for encountering major problems, but the fact that these problems are interrupting their normal life instead of normal life interrupting their problems makes the characters feel much more grounded.<br />
<br />
This leads in to the fact that Railgun also manages to really capitalize on its excellent setting in this season.  Railgun in this season develops to the point that I can say that it is the best superpowers anime out there in my book.  It has a believable method for superpower development, it has a satisfying variety of powers, and the society seems to have developed in sync with superpowers in a believable way.  When the least believable part of the world-building is the fact that every goes to school in some giant school city, you know that they&#039;ve done the superpowers aspect right.  Tack on to this world-building villains that motivations other than simply dominating the world and a place in the cast for those without significant powers and you have an absolute gem.<br />
<br />
I also have to mention that the one thing Railgun has consistently done well is allow characters to win battles with their brains instead of their brawn.  Yes, this show definitely features characters that are by no means weak, but that goes for both the villains and the heroes.  But in the end, the key to winning the battle is by coming up with a smart application of powers instead of simply being gifted a power boost by the gods of trying hard.  This approach makes for much better storytelling, since the writer has to make enough effort not to plot themselves into a corner, and it allows characterization to take place during conflict, as we watch characters solve problems on the fly.  This aspect above any other is why this superpowers anime is at the top of my list, since this is the heart of doing superpowers correctly.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve also got to give a nod to the quality of the animation this season.  Yes, there were delays in production due to the coronavirus, but those delays were used well, as the animation quality remained superb.  In particular, there were three excellent battle scenes over the course of the series that were especially well done, both in terms of animation and in terms of the storytelling of the battles.  J.C. Staff may be better known for quantity than quality, but this season showed that they can really hit it out of the park when they want to.<br />
<br />
In the end, this season really captured the essence of Railgun.  Great action with characters well seasoned by appropriate splashes of slice-of-life.  Characterization done well across the spectrum, from the heroes to the villains.  Battles where characters succeed by thinking smarter instead of just &quot;leveling up.&quot;  Stellar animation, great OP&#039;s and ED&#039;s, really, what more can you ask for?  This third season has finally come to an end, and all I can think is that I&#039;m already excited for the fourth, however distant it may be.

    Unlike the total failure that was the third season of Magical Index, A Certain Scientific Railgun T delivers on what the fans want, more Railgun, and back better than ever. Everything about Railgun T is an improvement from the previous seasons to the animation, art, music, etc. The story and plot doesn&#039;t feel cut out and confusing, instead giving the viewer another fun experience with the familiar characters we have all come to love fighting against newer and tougher bad guys, and continue to develop and grow as characters with each other. Even side characters get their own time to shine in the spotlight in

Well there really isn&#039;t much else to say. I rate this anime with a 10 and highly recommend this amazing sequel, it&#039;s a must watch to any fans of the series as it continues to expand.

    By now, you know what you&#039;re getting out of Railgun. Slice of Life moments with the girls mixed with amazing action sequences and uncovering the mysteries of Academy City. Railgun T brings us back to the world of Toaru after a less than stellar 3rd season of Index and offers a return to form for the famed series. Railgun T takes everything that Railgun 1 and S had and cranks it up a notch, in the best possible way. <br />
<br />
This season really does a great job of developing both Misaka and Misaki as well as laying the ground work for future events in the universe.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357434">
        Over the course of 25 episodes, there was genuinely never a dull moment. You can tell which of the 3 Toaru series JC staff favours more, as quality has always been consistently excellent with the Railgun series.This season is no exception. Awesome fight scenes with movie like quality down the stretch, beautiful art and an amazing OST adding atmosphere to scenes. Another great job by the production staff.<br />
<br />
Overall, Railgun T has to be the strongest entry in the Toaru series so far to date. It&#039;s got everything we&#039;ve come to know and love about Railgun, but better. A must watch for any fan of the series and I&#039;d argue any anime fan in general. Railgun T gets 9 zaps out of 10.

    Short Review but the first 13 eps are amazing And I will tell you why! (And some minor spoilers.)<br />
<br />
-The cast is still the same as 8-9 years ago.<br />
<br />
-Kuroko became more a badass then a perv (not that it was bad or something but she is now really awsome) <br />
<br />
-A amazing entrance of The railgun we all know.<br />
<br />
- A new intressting Arc that is almost as good as the sister Arc.<br />
<br />
- A cool intro.<br />
<br />
- New amazing characters teaming up together<br />
Spoiler: Touma and Gunha.<br />
<br />
- Anamation again amazing.<br />
<br />
- Touma also became more badass.<br />
<br />
- And a bit more fanservice ;)<br />
<br />
-And Our old villain is back...<br />
<br />
So yeah I dont know

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340211">
        but this season is amazing, and its really different from the other series. Unlike the Sister arc they play also a role in this arc. It was really a great beginning to the series after so many years.<br />

    After watching Index, Railgun, Index II, Railgun S, Index III, I decided to catch myself up on the world of Railgun, Railgun T. So far, as only 15 eps have aired so far, I want to just say that this is the best season of the Toaru series as a whole. The first arc, without spoilers, is pure genius. Not only do you witness several of Academy City&#039;s Level 5 espers that have never had much screen time before, but many ideas and characters from previous seasons and series come back and are expanded upon greatly. As usual, the art is incredible, and the sound

          <span style="display: none;" id="review342882">
        is immaculate. There were many instances of me shivering at how crazy both the art and sound come together. Even if you had no clue what was happening, the fight scenes and just overall scenes are beautiful. If you didn&#039;t know already, this takes place during Index II, however, the way that the events are portrayed here, are far superior than the way that they were created in Index. I highly recommend watching Railgun T, however, watching at least Railgun and Railgun S if not the Index series is a requirement.

    (A Certain Review from an LN and Manga Reader)<br />
<br />
This is an adaptation that is long overdue, and right off the bat it quickly delivers the uniquely Railgun experience that has captivated millions of anime fans around the world (China really loves this anime for some reason).<br />
<br />
Everyone and their mama agrees that the Sisters&#039; Arc in Railgun Season 2 is some of the finest animation ever put on television, and guess what? We&#039;ll get another arc that is just as action-packed and just as filled with intrigue on Academy City&#039;s dark secrets. Enter the Daihasei Festival Arc.<br />
<br />
Misaka Mikoto is just as good as ever, and her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330961">
        signature, titular move Railgun continues to be one of the best and most hype-inducing animated sequences ever produced by man. However, in this arc, her ideals will really be put to the test. Whereas in previous seasons she could get away with just outpowering and outsmarting her opponents thanks to her Level 5 status — this time, there is no such thing as simply fighting back against the system. Yes, as it always has been, her true enemy will be once again the Dark Side of Academy City. This time, situations will be a bit more... dire &#039;though.<br />
<br />
Well, enough about that. I want to talk about the really strong supporting trio in this anime, that being Kuroko, Saten-san, and Uiharu. Singlehandedly, these three together are what makes the anime sometimes better than the source manga. In the manga, these three aren&#039;t really as close to Mikoto, and I&#039;m glad J.C. Staff took some liberties with this. We had two seasons to see them interact together with Mikoto and grow into this really lovable quartet of characters that you can&#039;t just help but root for. Kuroko&#039;s... tendencies are back in full force and boy, were they missed. Saten-san and Uiharu continue to be this duo that just always seems to be able to tease; to take a momentary, fleeting peek — into Academy City&#039;s darkness, something which they totally could do without. But there we go.<br />
<br />
Now that I mentioned J.C. Staff, their Railgun bias is really showing hard. Index totally needs and deserves a do-over while Railgun just continues to get better. The art and animation has been consistent thus far. This is a personal nitpick but I feel the OP isn&#039;t as good as it could be, but then again, it&#039;s hard to top such top-tier OP&#039;s like &quot;only my railgun&quot; and &quot;Sister&#039;s Noise&quot;.<br />
<br />
Overall, a very enjoyable adaptation so far. No deviations as of yet, and hopefully it will continue that way especially for this important Daihasei Festival Arc. Highly recommended to all fans of Index/Railgun, especially those that have endured through the nearly 7 years of Railgun anime drought. It&#039;s completely worth it.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s enjoy some Railgun!! These are good times~

    I am very happy to watch the third season of the railgun! I love it! I like the first season but I think the second season is not so much. That is because the theme of this anime is friendship. The first part of Railgun S only focuses on the Kamijo Toma. Misaka ignores more important friend Uiharu, Saten, and Kuroko. However, Railgun T focuses on friendship again! We can also see friendship of Kongoumitsuko. That is what I wanted to watch! In terms of art, this must be a masterpiece. There are a lot of technic for taking watcher into this anime. For example,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330753">
        when Uiharu does the hacking to the computer for looking for the clue of mystery substances, the door is suddenly opened by someone. This is the technic. Because of this, we imagine someone may come for arresting Uiharu. We can see such kind of technics in any respects.

    plus point for JC Staff in making action anime<br />
<br />
My expectations were high, because the railgun series was in the hands of JC.Staff had good progress, but I didn&#039;t expect it to be this good.<br />
First, it is clear that the graphic improvements are very visible, indeed the range from Railgun S to Railgun T is 7 years, no wonder the upgrade is very visible in the graphics. I am waiting for the bluray, I hope the bluray version can be brighter, because the Railgun coloring is a little dull like foggy for the TV version.<br />
<br />
There are no complaints for the song, all the railgun opening by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357628">
        Fripside must have entered my playlist, the ending songs are also nice to hear, I am the one who appreciates singers by not skipping to the end while watching, the sound effect is better than the railgun S presenting. frenda rocket sound effect, metal pounding, bomb explosion, and don&#039;t forget to thank you for returning the imagine breaker that was changed to index 3<br />
<br />
Story, no complaints. Even though there were some cut scenes especially in the dream ranker arc, it didn&#039;t spoil the story. The rest of the manga is accurate because I also follow the manga<br />
<br />
I still ask why JC staff and T railgun crew prefer &quot;manual drawing&quot; for the touma dragon strike?<br />
Meanwhile, they made a very impressive CG in the last arc Dream Ranker battle. Actually I hope that dragon strike is made in CG to make it look more real, especially the scales &quot;because dragons have scales&quot;, for example, it can be seen in the elder centipede One Punch man 2 made by JC Staff. but what I see, Touma&#039;s dragon form is a bit stiff, dull in coloration, and his movements don&#039;t show that &quot;it&#039;s big&quot; isn&#039;t a bad thing, but I expected more of this.<br />
<br />
I am very satisfied with the Railgun T, it can really treat the disappointment of the index 3, and the anime version of the accelerator which is not good in my opinion, is very stiff. I hope that after this, Kadokawa, JC staff and all the crew involved in the Toaru project can maximize the Index NT, because that&#039;s a good story material from the Toaru series. If handled properly, it is not impossible that this series will equal or better than the Fate Series in Ufotable&#039;s hands.

    There&#039;s nothing happier in the anime world when you get a sequel of the very first TV anime series that you have finished, containing the no. 1 favorite anime character of all time, and the production team poured everything, every heart, every effort to ship out arguably the best season overall of a huge, long running series over a decade after its first anime adaptation, under some of the worst production environment one could face and a completely knocked out airing schedule with the most start-stops I have ever seen.<br />
<br />
Allow me to paraphrase one review of a certain 10/10 rated game released in June this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357597">
        year:<br />
<br />
&quot;Railgun T is a masterpiece worthy of its predecessors. Taking strides forward in nearly every way, we have even more well-written characters like the seductive Misaki Shokuhou stepping into the spotlight and carries the long awaited, much required and hugely promising sequel in a manner that feels like the culmination of everything that’s made To Aru’s blockbuster storytelling so memorable since the original Index back in the good old golden days of 2008. It delivers a layered, emotionally shattering story in 2 big arcs as heart gripping as the famous Sisters Arc of Railgun S, on top of continuing excellent world building and surprisingly well done action animations that improves the last season’s setting consistency with eliminating half-baked original arcs while integrating a bit more of Index’s deeper story themes and yet still keeping Slice Of Life/comedy scenes as funny as they can. But while Railgun T is a thrilling adventure that long since have transpired friendship and evil scientists, it still makes time for a stunning, nuanced exploration of the strength and fragility of the human spirit. The Leader of all Light Novels has one of its best comebacks in one of the generation’s best anime produced.&quot;<br />
<br />
Continuing the outstanding character development of Railgun S 7 years ago, both major arcs this season continues tons of growth for our main cast, new characters and even minor ones who didn&#039;t had much time to even tell their own stories. The plot continues to be as heart gripping as ever from start to finish, and while it&#039;s probably too much to ask for yet another landmark moving scene a la that one in Railgun S&#039; Sisters arc, we saw quite a few poignant moments this time around that are just as emotional. And this season went away with one of the major problems in the last two seasons - anime original arcs that have weaker than usual plots/character development and even settings contradicting the main series (see Railgun S Silent Party arc for a big example). <br />
<br />
Only major problem I can find of Railgun T is the animations which unfortunately suffered some drop in quality from Railgun S, however anyone who know about studio JC STAFF and the history of To Aru will know that it is a miracle that it&#039;s still *that* good with the all-star production team during Railgun S a one-off phenomenon. Indeed with JC STAFF overloaded in recent years, not to say 2020 pandemic production disruptions, I would never thought I can see still consistently quite good animations across all 25 episodes (considering the production schedule was in literal chaos early this year). Never mind that excellent animations popped up in the climax of both big arcs, that fight in episode 24 being one of the best I&#039;ve seen this year!<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know if we will see a 4th Railgun season in the future, especially with the major crash of the latest season of its parent series and the lukewarm response to the other spin-off anime series of To Aru. There&#039;s also the problem that there&#039;s probably only enough source material to make another 12 or so episodes within a year or two. But with this season ending up as one of my favorite TV anime of all time (tied with Madoka Magica), I simply hope that this series will keep on delivering in the future. Maybe even help out A Certain Magical Index with a re-born in the anime world.<br />
<br />
Railgun T is my Anime Of The Year of 2020, and I&#039;m proud to say that.

    Tatsuyuki Nagai loves Railgun and boy does it show...<br />
<br />
Toaru Kagaku no Railgun T leaves off where from the second season with the Daihasei Festival arc that brings Misaka and her friends into the Dark Side of Academy City...<br />
<br />
All things considered Toaru Kagaku no Railgun T does a perfect job in giving us new characters and developing throughout this season and making us like them, be it if they are friends or rivals to Misaka whilst developing Misaka at the same time and that just made LA love Railgun T even more. Railgun T brings into light of Misaki Shokuhou voiced by Azumi Asakura, one of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357480">
        Misaka&#039;s rivals of Tokidaiwai School and throughout this arc we more or less see her rivalry towards Misaka but also sees both Misaki and Misaka grow together through what the Dark Side of Academy City has in store for them. Of course since this is Railgun, Touma is also in the mix considering the timeline of Railgun T and all and what transpires through the Daihasei Festival arc becomes something huge (as expected from the To Aru series). Though ALOT of stuff happens in the Daihasei Festival arc, two things happen that made LA change LA mind, that being Misaki isn&#039;t all that bad, it&#039;s mainly because from the previous seasons, through Misaka&#039;s perspective we just saw Misaki as just a snarky trickster ojou rival to Misaka, but the Daihasei Festival arc gave out more about her, fleshed her out to the point of LA balling LA&#039;s eyes out to the resolution of the events of the Daihasei Festival arc and that was just a key to getting Misaki to being LA&#039;s 3rd favorite waifu of the To aru series because of this arc, the other being that we get to see Misaka&#039;s hatred for the higher ups and the Sister Project manifest in a different way in this arc thus developing both Misaka and Misaki through this arc which LA just LOVED.<br />
<br />
Of course Kuroko, Saten and Uiharu does get their own episodes after the Daihasei Festival arc, where there is the emergence of &quot;Indian Poker&quot;, cards that let you experience people&#039;s dreams as well as an app that tells of when people got injured or &quot;will die&quot;. Through the interim of this arc to the Dream Ranker arc, Saten also bumps into Fre nda of ITEM and even becomes friends of the sorts as well as an ambush of Yumiya of SCHOOL converging into something big happening come the Dream Ranker arc, but LA put this as a pin in the review as the interaction of Saten and Fre nda was quite interesting, heck Misaka even bumps into Kinuhata in the look for &quot;Bust Upper&quot; card as well in the interim which was also interesting, this also at least much like not looking at Misaki at face value, that ITEM ain&#039;t that bad either in terms of villiany...heck if you think ITEM is bad, SCHOOL and Scavenger are soo much worse.<br />
<br />
The Dream Ranker arc, deals with &quot;Indian poker&quot; a new craze going on in Academy City where it lets the holder of card have dreams and thus learn things from others, however things gets crossed when we learn of the originator of Indian Poker thus leading into Misaka bumping into Scavenger and worst, an experiment gone wrong with Misaki in tow to stop another Sister-like project. This arc at the start does deal with some minor situations with Misaka&#039;s group of Kuroko and Saten but afterwards, this arc goes into full gear once Scavenger is introduced and MAN, this arc doesn&#039;t mess around with the stakes and the main &quot;villain&quot; of this arc and it&#039;s another Level Upper situation in a grander scale with Misaka needing to stop the main villain. Dream Ranker arc really was something else especially with the fight against the major villains of the arc was something to behold similar to Daiheisei Festival arc&#039;s fights. Nonetheless the Dream ranker arc is just as good if not close to Daiheisai Festival arc in terms of greatness for Railgun and Dream Ranker arc is also GREAT because of the good amount of interesting interactions with the Railgun cast with other groups, ala Fre nda with Saten and Misaka with Kinuhata to Misaka with Scavenger of all groups.<br />
<br />
The animation done by JC Staff was AMAZING, right down to the fight scenes and sometimes the batshit crazy moments of Railgun T, JC Staff once again outdid themselves with the animation, the slick updated character designs, the beautiful backgrounds, the awesome battles and the comedic hijinks and timings of the animation done to T. LA will say it again but JC Staff outdid themselves and LA will say under the guidance of Tatsuyuki Nagai made it so. Bravo JC Staff.<br />
<br />
The voice cast was once again amazing as well, most are returning voice cast from Railgun&#039;s previous seasons as well as Index and Accelerator but nonetheless the voice cast of Railgun T was amazing, from Rina Sato&#039;s down pat thundereness of Misaka Mikoto, Satomi Arai&#039;s crazy yandereness of Kuroko, the down to earth but ordinary yet extraordinary luck of Saten of Kanae Ito and the shy but calculating nice girl of Uiharu of Aki Toyosaki. Some major props also to Azumi Asakura of the sly but devilishly femme fatale ojouness cadence of Misaki Shokuhou. The voice cast, LA could talk forever but LA will once again limit it to MVP&#039;s and those easily goes to Rina Sato and Azumi Asakura, they were just soooo good this season.<br />
<br />
Railgun T delivered to everything LA wanted from another season of Railgun T and then some, great character development ACROSS the board from Fre nda, Misaka, Misaki, Mitori, Kuroko, Saten, Uiharu EVERYONE did their part be it good or evil characters and really fleshed out To aru&#039;s universe even more, add to the GREAT detail in it&#039;s animation and stella voice casting as always from JC Staff and Tatsuyuki Nagai. LA LOVED Railgun T and all it&#039;s characters and this season was by all means another step up from Railgun S, not that S was bad either, but man T brought it&#039;s SSS game and then some.<br />
<br />
Now if only Index had the same treatment.....<br />

    Railgun T is a fantastic continuation to Railgun S that refines the formula the series has established. It is still exceedingly thematically robust, focusing on scientific research in Academy City having thrown ethics by the wayside. While certainly stronger than Railgun S, having adapted two full arcs without any anime-only stories, it still has some residue issues from the series as a whole. Despite that, it is undeniable that this is the Index franchise at its best, with Railgun&#039;s more upbeat adventure style merging with some of the darker and higher stakes elements of Index. <br />
<br />
The first arc of the seasons covers the Daihasei Festival

          <span style="display: none;" id="review372605">
        which centres around a brewing multi-sided conflict and mystery. It&#039;s position and function in the overall season of Railgun T mirrors the Sisters arc in Railgun S. It is a darker, higher stakes story where Mikasa is isolated from her friends and forced to deal with an immense amount of uncertainty. Following the Daihasei Festival is the Dream Ranker Arc which is more loosely constructed, functioning as more of a collection of events that involve the supporting cast. This has the same role as the Silent Party arc in Railgun S, where it is meant to be a palate cleanser to the previous tense story. Dream Ranker returns to the more adventurous, slice-of-life tone that the original Railgun had, showcasing more supporting characters and fun moments. In this, we can already see that Railgun T is following a formula established by its predecessor and tying its events back to earlier seasons as much as possible. While that formula was rough around the edges in Railgun S, the current season refines its and brings out much of its potential.<br />
<br />
The Daihasei Festival starts with the familiar Railgun tone of having more slice-of-life and fun character moments in its early episodes as the conflict begins to escalate. Railgun T already surpasses its previous seasons out of the gate with its superior pacing, escalating the arc&#039;s conflict by episode three to have it as the centre of attention. The Daihasei Festival gives us a fun, fast-paced taste of Mikasa&#039;s life as a student with sports events before quickly inciting the conflict. This is a vast improvement over the Sisters Arc, having faster and more consistent pacing that maintains both tension and interest without it becoming overwhelming. This arc also demonstrates that the writers know how to handle a powerful character like Mikasa, who has exceptionally potent combat abilities. Instead of using direct combat threats to build tension, which risks going off the rails due to her high power level, they pin Mikasa down and get to her through social constraints on her actions. This narrative approach gives the arc a robust emotional underpinning as it is her friends that are in danger. At the same time, it also keeps the stakes appropriately high by presenting a problem which Mikasa cannot solve by blasting through it with her Railgun.<br />
<br />
Characterisation of such an emotionally charged story is accordingly strong with Shokuhou Misaki being both the perfect foil and complement to Mikasa. While Mikasa&#039;s electromaster powers have excellent combat applications, Shokuhou&#039;s are the exact opposite. Aside from the obvious act of mind-controlling any opponents with her Mental Out ability, she has zero combat potential on her own. The show highlights this contrast further by pointing out Shokuhou&#039;s complete lack of even ordinary athleticism when compared to Misaka. However, her Mental Out has staggering social applications that easily corner Misaka and isolate her from allies and friends through memory manipulation and straight-up mind control. The different powers highlight and complement their difference in character, with the tomboyish Mikasa and the prissy Shokuhou seemingly being doomed to despise one another.  Their different personalities are clearly born from their different abilities, the raw power of being an electromaster favouring a direct approach, and the manipulative potential of Mental Out favouring a very indirect one. Despite initial impressions, the show teases us with the idea that they would be the perfect team if they worked together, making up for each other&#039;s weaknesses. As the arc goes on, we also get insight into Shokuhou, which reveals she is just as much a victim of Academy City as anyone else. Shokuhou&#039;s strong characterisation with her well-developed but different sense of justice based on her experience also helps give Mikasa even greater depth through contrast.  <br />
<br />
Similarly, the supporting cast members get some time to shine in this arc, even though it is more focused on Mikasa and Shokuhou. With Mikasa&#039;s closest friends being impaired from assisting her early on, we get to see the extraordinary character growth of Kongou who steps up immediately. Railgun T manages to complete her character arc, going from a vain but insecure individual in the first season to a dependable friend with deepening relationships. The introduction of Sogiita was also a welcome addition which highlighted a gap in character Railgun previously had. Although ostensibly filled by Kuroko, there had not been a fun, brash and reckless character in the cast. His appearances in Railgun give the moments and battles fun and energetic elements, beyond what the current cast could achieve by themselves. <br />
<br />
At the same time, elements of the supporting cast are where Railgun T falls behind slightly. While nowhere near as isolated in atmosphere as the Sisters Arc, the early incapacitation of Kuroko, Saten and Uiharu feels like a step backwards. Though an undeniably an effective way to attack Mikasa and build the tension by cutting away her support network, it undercuts their character growth from Railgun S. There are some attempts to remedy this issue, by having them still come together to support Mikasa despite their mental state. Yet, it only implicity puts forward the idea that their friendship has deepened to the point where it can transcend external pressures. Mikasa, being the only one unimpaired, does not regain their support through her understanding of them as individuals, which would have clearly demonstrated progress in their friendship, even if only from her perspective. Their eventual later involvement in the Daihesei Festival arc also exposes another issue with the current Railgun formula. The large scale conflicts at the core of each arc are too great in power level for Saten and Uiharu to contribute effectively or convincingly. Even though they play a role in ending the Daihasei Festival&#039;s conflict, it feels distinctly underwhelming since they are cut off from Misaka. Even Kuroko, who has sufficient strength in most scenarios to be a direct combatant, feels sidelined from the central action. While this is by no means a deal-breaking or even major problem, it feels disappointing since they are billed as main characters yet fall by the wayside. This is especially the case for Uiharu who gets very little screentime even in the Dream Ranker Arc.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, though Sogiita was a welcome addition that complemented Touma&#039;s character well, it had the opposite overall effect from the Mikasa-Shokuhou contrast. While Mikasa and Shokuhou contrasted each other as complete characters, highlighting each other&#039;s depth, Touma and Sogitta exposed the lacking elements in the formers characterisation. While Sogitta can get a pass in his lack of depth as a new side character, Touma&#039;s blandness and lack of depth cannot be made more apparent. It feels like Sogiita and Touma should be one character with their personalities balanced out in the middle to make for a more interesting protagonist. Though, this is more of an issue for Index, making it unfair to penalise Railgun for this. Ironically, Touma is an acceptable, if still slightly bland, supporting character from Mikasa&#039;s perspective.<br />
<br />
The following Dream Ranker arc is weaker as an overall story with only a tenuous throughline linking all the separate threads together. Despite that, it serves as an excellent change of pace from the more concentrated Daihasei Festival as it gives us a look into the adventures of the supporting characters. While it serves the same purpose in the overall season as the anime-only Silent Party arc, it is hard to say it is strictly better despite being an adaptation from the manga. While Silent Party suffered from a relatively mediocre premise for its plot and weak characterisation of its villains, it was more coherent. The Indian Poker technology that is meant to tie the separate stories in the last ten episodes together creates a convoluted connection to the Doppelganger climax. On the other hand, the various stories in Dream Ranker are all more creative, with fascinating or just plain fun premises like Kuroko&#039;s encounter with a precognizant esper or Saten and Frenda&#039;s adventure together. The idea of the Indian Poker technology alone sparks more interest that the admittedly trite motivations of STUDY in Silent Party. Despite its robust construction, delivering excellently on the more episodic, slice-of-life elements of Railgun and being far more polished than previous attempts, it also exposes another flaw in the overall formula. <br />
<br />
As an overall season, the structure of having the more &quot;serious&quot; arc involving many powerful characters followed by the more episodic &quot;lighter&quot; content creates a season finale issue. While the Daihasei Festival&#039;s finale was spectacular, it was also mid-season. This raises the question of how the overall season finale can compare or exceed it. What we get is the conclusion to the Dream Ranker arc feeling overdone, devolving into a massive Kaiju fight at one point. While not necessarily bad, it feels out of place and too exaggerated given the limited build-up and more confined scope. Also, where Dream Ranker actually falls behind Silent Party is the lack of other supporting characters&#039; involvement in its conclusion. Despite having more interesting ideas and conflicts, Mikasa still resolves this without the help of her friends. While also not necessarily a problem, it undercuts the idea that Railgun is at least part ensemble which its first season sold it as. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, Dream Ranker gave us some excellent character moments for both ITEM and Scavenger. The latter&#039;s introduction in Accelerator&#039;s spinoff was quite underwhelming, making them appear neither fun nor intimidating as characters. Their involvement in the conclusion of Dream Ranker helped rehabilitate this, solidifying their image as a quirky B-team of mercenaries meant to entertain rather than impress. Scavenger&#039;s delicate handling of Mikasa was also an excellent way to highlight the sheer power of level 5 espers and reinforce the idea that they are important actors in Academy City. At the same time, Dream Ranker improved on the attempt in Silent Party to flesh out Judgement with Kuroko&#039;s story showing more of how they operate. It also builds on the strength of Railgun, still dedicating time for falling action after each arc. Though with the tighter construction of the season as a whole, the slower moments feel like they lack some breathing room given how much they need to bookend. Despite these issues, Dream Ranker is still a step up in delivering character moments and fascinating premises compared to attempts in the earlier seasons.<br />
<br />
Overall, Railgun T is an excellent sequel which refines the formula established prior. It gives us more of what we have come to expect from Railgun as a series with superior control of its pacing and tone. Despite that, it is hard to say it is in absolute terms better than its predecessor Railgun S. This speaks to the sheer brilliance of the Sisters Arc&#039;s premise which is hard to surpass, but also the cracks starting to show in the fundamental construction of the series. Nevertheless, it was a fantastic ride watching Railgun T, being a solid 9 out of 10.

    As a massive fan of this series (Railgun being actually my fav anime from all times), I couldn&#039;t be more excited to watch this season and it did not disappoint me, as always.<br />
<br />
The first arc of Railgun T was even better than the Sisters&#039; arc of Railgun S, and that&#039;s saying a lot! We got to see more of the characters and their development, including characters with previous no special highlight (like Awatsuki and Wannai) and characters we didn&#039;t like at all (like Shokuhou and Frenda). Railgun, as always, brings us those dark sci-fi themes of the scientific part of Academy City, filled with its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review392241">
        good portion of mystery, plot development, comedy, fluff, a little slice of life, great characters, and the badass fights we all love. One of my favorite parts of this season was the episodes focused on each member of the main quartet and how they deal with certain situations in their own way. <br />
<br />
Though I might have to say, while the first arc, the Daihaisei Festival arc, of this series, was a pleasant surprise for me and made me anxious for more at the end of each episode, the second arc not so much. Don&#039;t get me wrong, it didn&#039;t make me enjoy this season any less, but compared to other arcs and the first half of T, the Dream Ranker arc felt somewhat rushed. Though the Indian Poker cards are introduced early in the first episode of the second half, it offers little correlation to the main dilemma of this arc. And when this dilemma indeed starts (the Doppelganger problem) characters and problems that should be an important part of it are introduced quickly, with little to no highlight and the fights are easily solved. Instead of a whole mystery that usually comes with the issue, the whole information is just easily given to Misaka and she just has to go there and beat up the bad guy. Done. I&#039;m not familiar with the manga since I still haven&#039;t started it yet, so I&#039;m not sure if it follows the same pace as the anime, but in my opinion the last 5 or 6 episodes could have been paced better.<br />
<br />
Overall, 9 zaps out of 10, one of the greatest but still slightly underrated animes of the last decade for sure. I&#039;m curious to how the next two arcs of Railgun will be portrayed.
