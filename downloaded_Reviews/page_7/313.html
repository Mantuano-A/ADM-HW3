    On the surface, Horimiya is a finely polished anime—Glistening character art, bright lighting, realistic backgrounds, glittery visual effects. Every voice actor suited their character, and their performances are convincing. Both the opening and ending credits are slickly animated with the utmost care and talent. The original soundtrack is average, but it fits every scene. Though I was immediately drawn to this anime for its impressive technical qualities, they weren’t good enough to overlook the subpar writing. <br />

Beneath the superficial presentation, Horimiya is a computer-generated romantic comedy story that thinks in cliches: It merges tropes from the mediocre rom-com anime with the worst parts of sappy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review389261">
        shoujo dramas. I should start by saying, I have never read the manga and this subpar anime didn&#039;t convince me I should. <br />
<br />
Chances are you&#039;ve heard this premise before: A male high school student with no friends meets a girl through a chance encounter. She&#039;s popular at school; still, she works hard to take care of her family, and she doesn&#039;t have time to socialize: The pair bond over their secretive lives. Despite his edgy appearance, the girl does not judge the boy. She encourages him to come out of his shell and find friends. In return, he does everything within his capability to make her happy. While it is a bog-standard plot, Horimiya was my kind of show. It had a simplistic trajectory: Make progress on Hori and Miyamura’s first love, tackle sexual awakenings, develop the side characters, and develop the themes of self-acceptance. That’s not quite how it went. Instead, they rushed through the story at a breakneck pace while repeating identical jokes and throwing in endless cliches. Fake dating scenarios, love triangles, perpetually pissed off heroines, and a tidal wave of misunderstandings. <br />
<br />
Even though the premise was simple, I liked seeing Hori and Miyamura together. Their relationship felt genuine; beginning as playful friends who got along despite their differences. Miyamura was a cipher at first—Quiet and introverted, he does not like school, cliques, and social requirements. He spoke very little about his personal life and he stood out from every other generic character design. Simply looking at him raises questions: Why does he have tattoos, nine piercings, and such long hair? All of these questions are answered in a very cut and dry manner. About two minutes of each episode is saved for flashbacks to his dark past. His backstories are presented with washed-out colors, quiet background sound, and darkened backgrounds to highlight his depressed state of mind. The solid presentation makes his melodramatic past seem more interesting than it is. With Hori&#039;s help, he overcomes his trauma, depression, and isolation (rather quickly). Miyamura&#039;s most significant obstacle was his inability to say how he truly felt. Characters joke about it because they reference how stereotypical his behavior is. If your story makes fun of a genre cliche, then repeatedly uses it, you are not subverting anything. The story is aware it is annoying and it does not care.<br />
<br />
Miyamura is a respectful guy; he&#039;s not possessive of Hori. He does everything she asks, and then some. When his friend Toru asked him for permission to date Hori, he said &#039;it&#039;s her choice&#039; because he&#039;s a decent person. Most importantly, he had plausible reasons for falling in love with her. His first reason was, &quot;She doesn&#039;t judge people based on looks.&quot; She embraced him even though society frowns up students with long hair, piercings, and tattoos. In reality, kids would be lining up to be friends with someone like him—but we need anime high school drama logic! So let&#039;s say being Cool makes him Uncool. Hori&#039;s classmates made fun of her for dating Miyamura since he&#039;s so uncool. Though she never let their words bother her. She accepted him, which made his high school experience better. He&#039;s the perfect guy for her. Yet in love stories, there&#039;s a problem if one of the partners is a little too perfect. <br />
<br />
Miyamura does anything he can to make Hori happy, even at his own expense. Though the story frames his selflessness as something good, his dedication strips him of individuality and all intriguing aspects. Such as to prevent Hori from getting teased, he cut his hair and stopped wearing his piercings because people looked down on him for them. However, Hori never needed help. I hate how the show frames his edgy appearance as a problem he must fix to have a good relationship. Part of what made this show so appealing was Miyamura&#039;s distinct appearance from generic high-school anime protagonists. As we found out, that amounted to little more than a marketing gimmick. In the first few episodes, it pitched itself as an emotional portrayal of bullying and depression, but those themes were bait. When it comes down to it, this show doesn’t give a rat’s ass about “Not judging people by their appearance.” When Miyamura tells his friends about people talking behind his back, they tell him to man up—in a show about bullying that we’re meant to take seriously. <br />
<br />
The only problems in their relationship that weren&#039;t Hori&#039;s fault were caused by contrivances. Miyamura&#039;s phone dies for five days, so Hori goes into panic mode and assumes the worst. The grand reunion is played up with dramatic slow motion, loud, emotional music, but it rings hollow. It&#039;s meant to feel like they&#039;ve been apart for a long time, but to us, it was only five minutes. What should&#039;ve been a significant turning point for their relationship felt inconsequential. Alone, this one contrived moment isn&#039;t a big deal; however, it is a persistent problem with the anime. The pacing issues are more noticeable the longer the show drags on. However, no amount of adaptation magic could&#039;ve saved Hori from being an awful person. She treats Miyamura like sewage water—yet no one ever meaningfully criticizes her, so she is never redeemed! No matter what Miyamura does, she’ll yell at him, whack him, or get silently pissed off. <br />
<br />
Girls compliment him? WHACK! <br />
She&#039;s feeling nervous? WHACK! <br />
He compliments her? WHACK! <br />
<br />
There&#039;s no winning with her. She&#039;s like every bad shoujo author&#039;s idea of a strong female character. Making your heroine hit and berate her boyfriend totally makes her a girl boss. These &#039;issues&#039; only got worse the longer they dated. First, she became possessive, then jealous, angry, and creepy. Mind you, Hori&#039;s short temper is not a character flaw. No, it&#039;s merely a sign of her love! Because this is how sane people act when they&#039;re in love, right? Hori could work on solving her anxiety and jealousy by communicating with her boyfriend. Or better yet, she could confide in her parents, who occupy background space for no reason. Her little brother acts as a bridge between the two when they&#039;re having one of their misunderstandings. When Hori finally expresses why she is upset about Miyamura getting attention from other girls, it is revealed to be all in her imagination! If they were able, to be honest, then these misunderstandings would stop. But we can&#039;t have that. We need Hori to be jealous because that&#039;s one of her three jokes! If I remember this show three months from now, it will be for those God damn misunderstandings. <br />
<br />
Relationships are about compromise. Loving someone requires giving and taking. Hori takes, Miyamura gives. Some relationships are acceptable this way, but this one is toxic. Miyamura is the glue that keeps them together because he&#039;s always patient and submissive. When Hori asks him to act dominant by berating and hitting her, he tries. Expectedly it didn&#039;t work, but it&#039;s not just played off as a joke. Hori asked him to be dominant, and she always gets what she wants. This is the level of humor in the second half of the show. She constantly asks Miyamura to hit her and insult her. He says no, and that he&#039;s not into that—yet she continues to pester him! I would&#039;ve ghosted her at this point, but he is perfect; therefore, he mustn&#039;t reject his queen. He even tries S&amp;M it for her sake, but it makes him uncomfortable. Even stranger, they do their S&amp;M shit in public. Their classmates just watch it happen and say &quot;Wow Miyamura is so cool...&quot; for calling his girlfriend a bitch. What kind of bizarre alternate reality is this writer living in? Still, Hori keeps asking him. If you&#039;re a masochist, and your partner isn&#039;t a sadist, don&#039;t force them to be one! To make her happy, he ignores his discomfort to berate and slap her. The writer must&#039;ve assumed S&amp;M just meant consensually abusing your partner in broad daylight. No, that is not how it works, nor is it good humor. <br />
<br />
Miyamura confides in Hori&#039;s father, saying he feels uncomfortable with the S&amp;M dynamic and asks for help. Finally, he spoke his mind! Hori&#039;s father tells her how Miyamura feels and to be considerate of her boyfriend&#039;s feelings. I felt blessed; finally, the show listened to my cries: Please stop being boring! You&#039;d assume this would be enough to get through to her… but no, she responds with, &quot;Stop blabbing about stupid crap and help me out with the chores.&quot; This could&#039;ve been a problem they resolved to strengthen their relationship, but no, it is played off for humor. I knew for certain Hori wouldn&#039;t get any worse than this. Right?<br />
<br />
Wrong. It&#039;s time to address the worst joke. Miyamura expresses attraction and considers dating other guys; it&#039;s apparent he&#039;s bisexual. That&#039;s cool! Bisexual people are great partners... though Hori would disagree. At the slightest implication that Miyamura is bisexual, Hori says, &quot;Gross,&quot; with a nauseated expression. A little bromance? &quot;Gross.&quot; To get the joke, we have to understand it from the way she does, and that is to believe it&#039;s gross. Very cool, girl boss. <br />
<br />
Toru&#039;s entire character encapsulates this joke. He was in love with Hori, but he got turned down in the first episode. Afterward, he stuck around to support Miyamura. The thing is, he&#039;s into guys too! He&#039;ll call a guy attractive, then everyone will go, &quot;Whaaaaat?&quot; How quirky! I swear some of his dialogue was ripped straight out of a BL manga. This isn&#039;t just a Hori thing. Random extras act disgusted when they see Toru being friendly with Miyamura. They tease romance with full intention of never making it happen because it&#039;s bait. So what&#039;s the point of the joke? There is none—the show tries to have its bisexual cake and eat it too. <br />
<br />
Every supporting character can be placed in at least one of three categories: 1. Nice on the outside, mean on the inside. 2. Constantly acts happy to avoid burdening others. 3. Too dumb to understand what&#039;s happening. Although some of them get a few seconds of characterization, it is skipped for the sake of dramatic romance. Ultimately none of their side plots mattered. They&#039;re simply a diversion from the primary couple, who could use more screen time because the anime skims through dozens in the blink of an eye. You probably won&#039;t remember all of their names, but thankfully their candy-colored hair makes it easy to tell them apart. <br />
<br />
Hori&#039;s friend, Yoshikawa, falls into all three. Her character flaw is that she has trouble communicating. She acts sweet to make everyone around her happy, but she actually does it because she&#039;s a spiteful person underneath. Like most of the cast, she narrates her thoughts and puts herself down because she lacks self-worth for unknown reasons. She hides her emotions for the sake of others to not be a bother. Aside from Very Original character writing, this doesn&#039;t make her unique. Everyone in the show is terrible at communicating—not because this is true to actual high school students, but because it&#039;s repetitive writing. It&#039;s never a mystery what a character is thinking, and if you can&#039;t tell, the directing makes it even simpler.<br />
<br />
When they don&#039;t know how to communicate the characters&#039; thoughts, they just put a text box on-screen. Adapting a manga involves more than copying and pasting panels—you creatively develop ways to show emotions through body language, music, camera angles, and editing. The extent of Horimiya&#039;s visual storytelling is by focusing on a character, slow motion, changing the backdrop to a white wall, and adding a colorful shadow. The first time, it was unique. It conveyed Hori and Miyamura&#039;s thoughts. Even though they were evident without the sudden art style change. Then they kept doing it. Eventually, it would happen five times per episode for each side character. It lost its effect right away and became forced. There are numerous more ways to convey the character&#039;s thoughts without recycling this mindless visual effect. It just made me roll my eyes. Before it felt personal like I intimately knew who these people were. But then it happened again. Then again. And before I knew it, every irrelevant character had their little introspective moment and I realized I didn&#039;t know these people at all. By the end I still had big questions, even about the main characters, for one—why does Miyamura continue to date Hori even though she&#039;s a toxic asshole?<br />
<br />
Nearly everyone has said Horimiya is a masterclass romance, that it is the anime of the season. All I saw was a subpar, run-of-the-mill anime weighed down by superfluous characters, annoying misunderstandings, rushed pacing, and a viscerally unlikable heroine. After sprinting past over a hundred chapters, the story screeches to a halt at the thirteenth episode with a tearjerker ending. I enjoy watching shamelessly corny love stories that make me tear up with joy. But I don&#039;t like anime that are so cliche that they do the tearing up for me. If you&#039;re new to anime, a lover of romcoms, and have a high tolerance for cliches, you&#039;ll get a kick out of this. To everyone else, there are much better choices than Horimiya.

    Hey.<br />
Hey you.<br />
Yes, you.<br />
<br />
Are you a girl who does the chores every day and babysit your younger sibling but wants to be popular in school? Or are you a boy with a gloomy-looking who doesn&#039;t talk to anyone in the school but wants to be an edgy boy? Or do you have fantasies about having a popular girlfriend who is a homebody after school? Or do you have fantasies about having a silent and gloomy boyfriend who is actually cool-looking and polite but will abuse you when you want? If all of the 4 answers of yours are no, then there is no reason to watch

          <span style="display: none;" id="review389252">
        Horimiya for you, because Horimiya is just about the author&#039;s random fantasies. It&#039;s as if she started writing this story without any plans in her head and just poured all of her fetishes into it. Some may be like this kind of story, but when it comes to romcom I want some good comedy or engaging story, not something that looks like that ripped out of an h-manga. Ironically, I&#039;ve seen h-mangas that have way better stories than this. In Horimiya&#039;s story, it looks like something is happening, but in the end, nothing actually happens. We all knew Hori and Miyamura will be lovers even before the anime started because of the title, and the only thing anime adds to this is some silly, overly dramatic, unnecessary, and cringe events.<br />
<br />
At least it has good visuals and OST. That was what I thought in the first episodes, but it quickly turned into a disappointment since Horimiya&#039;s director is a man who knows nothing about how to direct an anime. He is also responsible for the trainwreck that called Persona 5 the Animation, and he ruined a great potential in Horimiya too. There are too many scenes that could be impactful if the director was someone decent. He needs to stick to being an animator, and leave being a director to others. And about the OST, it&#039;s the same. If the sound director could&#039;ve used them in the right way, some scenes would be way more impactful, and the worst thing about this is the sound director, Jin Aketagawa, is actually a good sound director. For some reason he couldn&#039;t do a good job in this show. Is it the CloverWorks curse? And lastly, animations and voice actings are above the average, but they definitely can&#039;t save this wreck by their own.<br />
<br />
Oh by the way, characters are as silly as the story too. Actually, I thought it got a good cast of characters in the early episodes, but it quickly turned into a mess. I don&#039;t know why but the wholesome relationship between Hori and Miyamura turns into a toxic relationship after couple of episodes. And that&#039;s the point you realize author has no intention to keep going with the wholesome relationship of Hori and Miyamura at the beginning of the story and just writes her own S&amp;M fetishes. You can think, at least supporting cast is somehow okay, and can bring life into show, but no. They got the spotlights for some episodes, but there are no chances to shine for them since the events aren&#039;t anything engaging.<br />
<br />
So, if you say no to all of the questions I asked at the start, then there is no reason for you to watch this rubbish. Even peeing in the morning after a nonstop 8 hour sleep is more enjoyable than watching Horimiya.

    (TLDR at the bottom, as always, thanks for reading)<br />
<br />
*Obligatory I have read the manga statement*<br />
<br />
Good lord, I don&#039;t understand the love for Horimiya.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s say we have a cookie jar. Each cookie represents an anime in the romance genre, and for anyone who loves loopholes, I mean anime with romance as the main genre as opposed to sub-genre. You could probably fit about a good 10, 15 or so anime in there. Of course, with Horimiya now in the mix, if I managed to take out the cookie representing Horimiya, it would neither look nor taste like a distinction.<br />
<br />
In other words, Horimiya is #42897 of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376638">
        countless romance anime with zero backbone or just a plain old cookie in this case. Not bad, but nothing memorable or spectacular either.<br />
<br />
The plot is so basic that it can literally be simplified to a checklist which is similar to 90% of every romance anime. Otherwise, any deep explanation would be patronising, I am not here to belittle people, simply here to give my thoughts in the most necessary way. So we have:<br />
<br />
- Popular girl is a tsundere (I will give props that she isn&#039;t stupid though)<br />
- Gloomy dude is dense<br />
- It is really hard to remember things I can&#039;t remember<br />
- Gloomy dude fits in like everything is hallelujah despite his background<br />
- Unnecessary scolding/arguments for the sake of drama, looks like Jun Maeda was working on Horimiya<br />
- Not sure why I am doing this to myself, I really don&#039;t remember half things that go down in the anime<br />
- Rejection of the truth from both MCs, because there needs to be some kind of story to last.<br />
- Other things<br />
<br />
Audiovisuals are alright, CloverWorks really not disappointing us with fluid animation. Audio, however, the anime depends on voice most of the time. I am almost certain that OST is nonexistent aside from the odd one or two moments. OP and ED are pretty good though.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-wise, I enjoy a lot of things, I would be a liar if I said I didn&#039;t like Horimiya. Sometimes I do find myself laughing here and there with what has been given, but most of the time my face is blank. I will watch the whole thing, but I don&#039;t have high hopes. The comedy is what keeps it standing, not that it is always good though.<br />
<br />
TLDR:<br />
Horimiya is very basic, so much so it camouflages with the rest of the genre, that isn&#039;t a problem, but don&#039;t expect too much from it either.<br />
<br />
<br />
Horimiya is that one overrated anime of the season. Not sure why, but it is. I don&#039;t really want to say anything about this anime anymore, the reaction to this is very incomprehensible. Let&#039;s just say 5/10 and peace be with you. For anyone wondering, the next season isn&#039;t going to be any better.<br />
<br />
By the way, Kimi ni Todoke is the distinction. Tastes like $100,000 golden ice cream. Would wholeheartedly recommend it.

    [Overall Score: 8.5]<br />
Horimiya is one of the most anticipated adaption ever. After years, when everyone gave up on an adaption, there was an announcement. It might not be an exaggeration to say that Horimiya is Winter 2021 most anticipated anime right after SnK final season. After reading the manga for so many years, I was also happy to hear the news. Did it live up to my expectations? Yes.<br />
<br />
Horimiya feels like it’s about to cross that line between a light-hearted rom-com and an over the top romance drama, but it never does, which is a good thing (A reference from the Oscar winning film, Parasite).

          <span style="display: none;" id="review389302">
        On one hand, we have stuff like overwhelming drama like White Album, on the other hand, we have Horimiya, which balances between drama and simplicity so elegantly. The simplicity of Horimiya is what makes it stand out from other rom-coms, and is part of the reason why the manga was crazy popular, long before the adaption.<br />
<br />
Horimiya (Full title: Hori-san to Miyamura-kun) at first glance, might seem like the typical “Popular girl dates unpopular guy” story, but it isn’t. Kyoko Hori is a popular girl at her school, almost like an idol for students. Everyone looks up to her, this pushes a burden onto her, she always has to maintain her perfect-girl attitude in front of everyone else. After all, its the people around us who decide our social standing, not us. She has a side she doesn’t want to show to others. In one scene, a bunch of girls saw Hori near the supermarket, one of them exclaimed how she resembles Hori, but then they say that she was too ‘simple’ to be Hori. You can see the burden that is pushed onto her. It’s not easy being popular and act perfect when you are not. Hori only shows her simple and imperfect side to those she cares about a lot—like her family, her close friends like Yuki.<br />
Miyamura on the other hand, is a gloomy student who barely converses with others. He can definitely pass off as a side character because he’s that unremarkable among students. In his flashbacks, we see Miyamura get bullied and ignored by his classmates, we also get to see him do his piercings by himself with a safety pin, side-by-side to those events. In this way, the act of piercing his ears comes as a response to the bullying. He also has tattoos on his body. So to hide all these features of him, he has grown shoulder length hair and wears a jacket, even in the hottest of days. He stands out among the other students in his school, but not in a good way.<br />
One day, both Hori and Miyamura just happen to meet, but not under normal circumstances. Both of them show their hidden sides to each other. Miyamura happily accepts the real Hori, just like she accepts Miyamura. Thanks to Sota, their wingman, they spend a lot of time together and slowly starts developing feelings for each other.<br />
<br />
The story is hardly remarkable at this point, so what is it that’s so good about Horimiya? The characters. I have to admit, the characters in this anime feel so much more genuine than I’ve seen in hundreds other rom-com. Horimiya is by far the most genuine feeling rom-com I’ve ever seen. The character interactions elevates this anime to another level. First off, the interaction between the quartet—Hori, Miyamura, Yoshikawa, Ishikawa, they feel so calming. There is a certain warm feeling in this anime, and it’s all thanks to the characters. It’s almost surprising how they can develop the side characters so well in an anime that focuses on two characters.<br />
<br />
Yoshikawa is a character that hides her true feelings. She won’t tell people what she truly desires. As said by Hori, “The less she wants you to know she’s upset, the bigger she smiles”. True feelings can not always been shown, there are many circumstances to people. Ishikawa is a long time friend of Hori and Yuki, he is also becomes good friends with Miyamura. Though he’s one of the more simple characters, he cares about others a lot. When Yoshikawa tried to make cupcakes but it didn’t turn out well, Toru was poking fun at her, he happened to glance at her fingers and notice some bandages, which is proof how hard she tried to make those cupcakes. He immediately starts eating those, even though it looks inedible, he eats all of it, with a big smile on his face. There’s the student council president, Sengoku and Remi who have their own unique dynamic. He is with her because he thinks she’s weak and he likes the feeling like he can protect her. But actually, she isn’t weak at all. Remi lets him feel that way on purpose because she likes him so much. Kouno is also very insecure because she’s always with Remi, who’s like an idol at her school, similar to Hori. They are together so much, that some students call them “Beauty and the Beast” beauty referring to Remi, beast referring to Kouno. Similar to how Miyamura felt that he brought down Hori’s image by being with her so much, Kouno also feels the same.<br />
<br />
Of course, not all the characters are good. There is Sawada, who’s the damsel in distress and cockblocks Miyamura for a few episodes. She’s annoying and doesn’t know the idea of personal space. She desperately forces herself into the cast and takes away screen time. There’s Yanagi, everyone pretends that he’s so hot and beautiful that in front of him, their own ugliness wants to make them puke. This whole bit with Yanagi is just not working at all and taking away the screen time.<br />
<br />
The characters are definitely what makes Horimiya so great, but is that the only aspect of what makes this anime great? Definitely no.<br />
<br />
CloverWorks is gaining a reputation because of their well directed anime. The Horimiya anime (much like Kimetsu no Yaiba) is a lesson in how to properly adapt a manga series. The anime’s direction, pacing and the excellent voice cast elevates every scene to the next levels. Ishisama is a great director who knows what he’s doing. The opening of Horimiya is possibly the most well-directed opening of Winter 2021. CloverWorks is quickly becoming one of my favourite studios. The camera work in this anime has been pleasant. Especially the moments of vulnerabilities, I was wondering how will they handle that, but it was handled amazingly. When the background goes white and vibrant watercolors shift their silhouettes, you know that they’ve given extra care to the more dramatic scenes of Horimiya. Horimiya is a treat, beautifully animated by CloverWorks.<br />
<br />
The beautifully animated scenes, combined with the OSTs, especially during the dramatic scenes, the sound is yet another aspect Horimiya thrives at. Starting from the mesmerizing opening sequence, which perfectly fits Horimiya’s theme, to the unique ending sequence.<br />
One other thing that I must separately mention is the dialogue delivery. This is one of the most important factors to me when I watch an anime. The dialogue delivery feels WAY TOO genuine. The casts are so talented because it is music to my ears. There is no girl who talks in a high pitched voice which is borderline annoying, even Remi talks in a normal way, I expected her to sound annoying. Dialogue delivery is definitely one of the thing I expect the anime to do well, since it doesn’t exist in manga. And Horimiya absolutely nailed it, starting from the conversations to how they were executed, all of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
In summary, Horimiya is a satisfying adaption. Many people will find plenty of reasons to hate it, since even I admit that this isn&#039;t a perfect anime or something. For example, people might not like Hori&#039;s masochistic side or how he often hits Miyamura. Honestly, it doesn&#039;t matter to me. I am well aware of the fact that Hori is a bit violent in nature, but it is explained why, and it&#039;s not like she&#039;s the Tsundere from Zero no Tsukaima (An actual bitch), she admits her mistakes and admits how she knows she was wrong but she blames it on Miyamura anyways, she can&#039;t help it. Miyamura chose to accept that side of her, so who am I to judge what&#039;s good for him? Besides, S&amp;M is getting more popular day by day among people, I&#039;m here to watch anime, not to kinkshame anime characters.<br />
After waiting for so long, I am nothing but happy to receive such a quality adaption. This definitely lives up to the manga. The manga ended weeks ago, and I was looking forward to the anime every week. This Winter season has been a pleasant ride, with a mix of almost everything, Horimiya takes the spot of the best rom-com. It adapts the starting few chapters, which is the glorious chapters of Horimiya, even in the manga, so naturally I enjoyed it to the fullest. This is as best as it gets, so if you didn’t like this, don’t go into another season or into the manga.<br />
<br />
As for me, Horimiya is all I could ask from an adaption. Through ups and downs, the anime has proven itself with the stellar direction, well written and likeable characters, and an acceptable story. It definitely became one of my all time favourites. Since I have no Horimiya chapters to look forward to every month now, I’m gladly waiting for a second season :)

    Anime touting a gimmick always worry me. They throw in these attention grabbers in an attempt to say &quot;Hey look! I boast something different than those other shows of the same genre and concept as me, come and watch!&quot; But they often end up being entirely one dimensional because they solely revovolve around that one singular idea. Then the author realizes that they actually need more than a unique shtick to write a story and fail to craft an engaging narrative filled with expressive characters to support it. Whoops!<br />

I&#039;m worried because Horimiya so far feels like yet another example of this for the RomCom genre.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376639">
        It reels us in with the premise. Two characters who hide their true selves from everyone but each other? How exciting! Though my first issue is that their super special awesome secrets are...that one has piercings and the other does a lot of housework? Hmm...doesn&#039;t even sound that creative to be honest. And also, their &quot;secrets&quot; aren&#039;t even much of a big deal. I mean the main dude Izumi shows a purple haired guy his tattoos early on and nothing really becomes of it. But I get it. An author needs to have something about their work that draws people in. Though in the end, the premise doesn&#039;t seem to have much of a point besides getting the main characters to kick off their relationship. So I guess it ultimately served an adequate purpose. Just don&#039;t come into this anime thinking that the protagonists are going to have a lot of exciting drama or the like surrounding their, as the anime calls it, &quot;hidden selves.&quot; Though maybe they will later on. It just doesn&#039;t feel like the show will go in that direction at all based on what&#039;s been released thus far. <br />
<br />
Now we just gotta see if the RomCom elements are able to hold up. As of now, it&#039;s fine. But I wish it was more than that. It&#039;s primarily about the school and home lives of Hori and Miyamura...get it? HORI MIYAmura? Their names are the title!...I&#039;m embarrassed that it took me so long to figure this out...<br />
<br />
Well anyway, I hate to throw this term out, but generic is definitely the word I&#039;d use to describe Hori so far. She&#039;s a nice girl who has a violent, more tsundere side, but it isn&#039;t nearly as endearing or entertaining as say someone like Taiga from Toradora. And besides the bit of intrigue surrounding why Izumi did his body up to look like a level 1 hoodlum when he takes off his Clark Kent glasses, he&#039;s just been a shy, stuttering nice guy who doesn&#039;t know how to make friends. I enjoy watching wholesome friendship making as much as the next guy, but seeing Izumi take an episode to learn that not every student in existence is a bully who says mean things wasn&#039;t really that interesting. The pair are definitely not bad characters, I just hope I&#039;ll get to see further development for both of them down the line. <br />
<br />
The supporting cast seems interesting enough. I mean, they have a pretty exotic assortment of hair colors...Let&#039;s just hope there winds up being more to them than just fun hair colors. Speaking of coloring, I like the visual direction of the anime. While nothing spectacular, the art is pretty solid, and despite some basic backgrounds, I&#039;m happy with how vibrant the show looks. CloverWorks has done a great job with the animation, especially considering that they&#039;re handling the production of three anime this season. The voices fit the characters, though the soundtrack has been pretty unmemorable for me...yeah, I didn&#039;t really pay much attention to the audio to warrant any time discussing it, so moving on!<br />
<br />
What else can I say, this anime has been pretty average so far. I can watch RomComs like Clannad and Chuunibyou in one sitting and be completely entranced by them. What&#039;s especially important is that good RomComs really grasp my attention and intrigue within the first few episodes. Horimiya so far has not had that effect on me whatsoever. I hope it&#039;s able to evolve into something much more as the show progresses. <br />
<br />
Or it can just be a funny and cute casual show. That would work too.

    A  great take on Rom-Coms… y&#039;all need to chill on the hate<br />
<br />
Romcoms usually take a misstep and follow a formula of cliche tropes and becomes something that becomes hard to watch, this does the exact opposite. As a person who loves romcoms and romance type anime, this anime hits all the points for a great and original romance.<br />
<br />
The characters are a major factor in this anime that creates a more entertaining anime. Our two main characters complement each other and create moments of awe that we will never have.<br />
<br />
Izumi Miyamura is a different type of MC. He isn’t the braindead MC, but a realistic

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376650">
        one.  He creates moments of awe and possesses a new type of creativity in his looks, from otaku to badass real quick. His lovable character adds depth to Horimiya which I for one enjoy.<br />
<br />
Our tsundere waifu, Kyouko Hori, is the definition of the love you are missing. As a person that has read the source material, I can appreciate the adaptation towards the romance they cross with each other. Kyouko herself is a wonder, and although she might be a tsundere she doesn’t feel like that generic tsundere, no she gives off vibes of a real person in love.<br />
<br />
The animation and art are a great asset to this anime. CloverWorks adapted the anime nicely and on top of that, the show has amazing animation, always reminding myself of the love I will never have every time I watch an episode. The art is unique, to say the least, it provides us with a special take on the romcom generic art style we are used to seeing. Both animation and art are a different take on a unique romcom.<br />
<br />
As we all know this is a romcom so let’s talk about enjoyment. As a person who is biased for romcoms, I can tell you without a doubt this anime is an enjoyable and entertaining anime that will make you see the love that is nonexistent for all of us. If I were to be unbiased I can say without a doubt this anime is an enjoyable and entertaining anime that will make you see the love that is nonexistent for all of us. Watch it and don’t mind the hate that came from who knows <br />
where.<br />
<br />
The sound is great, but not too special. It brings sounds that will entrance you into the romance. The OP and ED are a nice addition to the rom-com, bringing unique sounds. The soundtrack follows the same as the usual romance anime of this sort, almost generic, but overall great. <br />
<br />
Overall, this anime brings unique assets that the rom-com genre desperately needed.<br />

    &quot;You are worth more than you know, capable of more than you think, and loved more than you can imagine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Undoubtedly the rom-com of the season, Horimiya has the potential to be great in every aspect of the genre, but the elephant in the room is obviously CloverWorks and the production team behind this show: the classic case of quantity over quality. I&#039;d like to think that we&#039;re playing a baseball match with CloverWorks for Winter 2021: Strike 1 for the horrible adaptation of The Promised Neverland (Season 2), Strike 2 for the abominable business practices of hampering Wonder Egg Priority&#039;s Behind-the-Scenes tragedy of director Shin

          <span style="display: none;" id="review389253">
        Wakabayashi and his production team, and finally Strike 3 for what is a total-misfire repeat of Strike 1 of going for a loose and inconsistent adaptation of the original source material (since it&#039;s basically marketing for the already completed manga). And you&#039;re out!<br />
<br />
&quot;You say &quot;There&#039;s more to this than meets the eye&quot; when you think a situation is not as simple as it seems to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
The main star of the show is the central couple: Hori Kyouko and Izumi Miyamura, two very distinct people, and so different-yet-alike each other. The former is a perfect social butterfly but the truth that she’s a brash homebody; the latter hiding a gentle heart, along with piercings and tattoos while under a gloomy façade. Both have things that don&#039;t want people to know that are best kept in secret, and a chance meeting proves to break the mirrors of their perceptions and in the perchance, solidify their relationship altogether within that short span of time. As time grows, both Hori and Miyamura learn of each other&#039;s quirks and what makes them tick that helps make their relationship grow stronger by the day. Kinda cute in spots, and to the people whom are having a relationship with their significant other will definitely feel those puppy-love moments that are relatable...well, except for some cringe S&amp;M moments (unless the girls are like bad-ass Hori that secretly adores boys like bad-ass Miyamura, and vice versa) and the eccentric familial conditions.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I look at the one thorn that is in my side of all my life, it is my weight. I fret about it, I&#039;m anxious about it, being an actor on TV - it drives me insane. It just seems to be something that plays a central part in waking up in the morning and thinking: &quot;How am I with myself today?&quot; - Deborah Mailman<br />
<br />
You would think that for such a self-titled show that all you&#039;re gonna see is how these two central characters would blossom, right? But instead of the rose that we got with Hori and Miyamura&#039;s relationship, there are more thorns on the stem of the side characters, as significant or insignificant as they may be (that&#039;s to your POV that I won&#039;t judge). By themselves, the side characters can be taken as a side story altogether, but since they&#039;re connected to the main bubbly girl, I&#039;d guess that this works primarily to advance their circumstances, rather than being tied onto the main couple, and for a rom-com that deems to be a romantic &quot;drama&quot; altogether, I&#039;m not sure if mixing in too much of slice-of-life moments is a good choice. Pretty much like Tomozaki-kun, the best way to infer is through the clique method:<br />
- Toru Ishikawa, Yuki Yoshikawa, Akane Yanagi and Hori herself.Toru being avid about his prospects of getting together with Hori only diminishes when he sees that the central couple are getting closer, quicker than it looks on the outside. Instead, he tries his best to steer clear of that direction, leading him to Yuki...but not quite the &quot;closeness&quot; as of yet. It&#039;s with the fickle-minded Yanagi that consciously brings Toru and Yuki close together, despite both playing the friendship treatment of going so far as to notice the affinities they have for each other. A potential couple, but played off as one of friend-zoning.<br />
- Kakeru Sengoku, Remi Ayasaki and Sakura Kono (with a wild Toru on the side): the Student Council trio. For the most part, both Sengoku and Remi has had quite the relationship with each other: a weak but capable guy and a bubbly, playful girl whose differences match one another, and they&#039;re as close to being realistic and vulnerable towards each other in their moments of time alone. Sakura is quite the character that most people will feel quite frustrated about, but for those who&#039;ve gone though the love ennui moments of noticing your crush from afar, you&#039;ll definitely find yourself in Sakura&#039;s shoes. She&#039;s an introvert through and through, but someone who&#039;s an extrovert when trying to reciprocate between the give-and-take of feelings, as such when she develops a crush on Toru, only to find that his kindness is returned, but not in the way she expected it to be. And it hurts real bad.<br />
- Miyamura, Koichi Shindo and Makio Tanihara (with a wild Hori on the side): the middle-school &quot;Happy Three Friends&quot; of a convoluted past. The reason why Miyamura is surfaced as a lonesome otaku geek at the beginning is because of Tanihara and his clique of friends who used to bully Miyamura for his ostracized looks, to the breaking point where what Miyamura once confided in was taken away from him, leading to the gloomy aspect. It&#039;s only through Shindo that Tanihara would come to start accepting Miyamura for who he is, with the heart talks between both cementing the reconciliation years later. Other than that, Shindo is the casual butt of a joker, and with Hori adding into the equation only makes the S&amp;M aesthetic look more prominent.<br />
- The others who have significantly less screentime: Shu Iura is the objectively loud airhead of a character whom is exactly like Shindo, Honoka Sawada whom is seen as the detractor of the Horimiya relationship, and the Hori family of a beautiful, yet somehow kinda &quot;broken&quot; family (in particular to Best Dad Kyosuke).<br />
<br />
Ideally I would want to paint this picture as someone whom has been in a relationship, but for the general audience, whether you&#039;re in one or not, Horimiya is as bare-bones as it can be, trading the romance aspect for its comedy of the Pareto Principle: 80% comedic slice-of-life, 20% romance.<br />
<br />
“We’re all a little weird. And life is a little weird. And when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours, we join up with them and fall into mutually satisfying weirdness — and call it love — true love.” – Robert Fulghum<br />
<br />
I find it quite the fascination of not just the OST that Horimiya has, but more of less its visuals and the intended picture of how people are supposed to perceive both the small and big moments, and this is something that I have to give the animators credit for. Starting off with the OP, it&#039;s interesting that there&#039;s 2 variations of Miyamura&#039;s theme: the 1st half where Miyamura is just like his old self, from reaching for the cube alone to most characters feeling dejected and frustrated, to the 2nd half where Hori&#039;s hand reached out for Miyamura with the cube, to the director&#039;s credit roll of him slicing the monochrome feel to showcase the colours of life with happiness overflowing. Capping off with the ED, it&#039;s using the twixt of a mix of animation in a dress-up model style between the central couple. Even with scenes that are depicted in the style of the OP of the potential couple-like feels, it&#039;s these Easter Eggs that not everyone will notice, but I thought it&#039;s worth mentioning. As for both OP and ED, it sounds great, no faults there.<br />
<br />
If I can sum Horimiya up in a quote, it&#039;d be this one by the famous Jamaican singer-songwriter Bob Marley:<br />
“You open your heart knowing that there’s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that’s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life.”<br />
<br />
As mentioned in the beginning, it&#039;s a loose adaptation of HERO and Hagiwara Daisuke&#039;s manga of the same name, but if I&#039;d reckon something that the anime lacked over the manga, it&#039;s good progression. The anime felt mostly like the typical slice-of-life situations of characters gone awry, and though the allegory of what got lost as the series progressed, so to did the anime that had to relinquish some good character development moments for simpler ones, and that to me, is a shame of how much Horimiya could&#039;ve been on par with the manga, but it wasn&#039;t meant to be...<br />
<br />
...or so could be best said: &quot;The source material is so much better.&quot;

    KareKano is a 1995 shoujo manga with a 1998 anime adaptation directed by Hideaki Anno.<br />
Here are some quotes from its synopsis:<br />
“Yukino Miyazawa is the female representative for her class and the most popular girl among the freshmen at her high school... However, in reality, she is an incredibly vain person... She wants nothing more than to be the center of attention and praise—which is why she cannot stand Soichiro Arima, the male representative for her class and the only person more perfect than her...<br />
...Soichiro visits Yukino house to bring her a CD and sees her uninhibited self in action; now equipped with the truth, he

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376665">
        blackmails her into completing his student council duties. Coerced into spending time with Soichiro, Yukino learns that she is not the only one hiding secrets.”<br />
<br />
That should sound familiar if you watch the first episode or at least read the synopsis of Horimiya. That’s because Horimiya is nothing but a bottom-of-the-barrel generic shoujo. And I’m not implying that Horimiya copied the “guy and girl discover each other’s secrets” premise from KareKano specifically - when KareKano did it, it already was a dead horse trope of the shoujo genre, similar to how Evangelion was satirizing accidental boob-grabs and running with toast in your mouth during the same time frame. <br />
<br />
What is unique about this generic shoujo is that it got published in a shounen magazine - and this is the reason behind all the hype the anime got from the source material readers. When a typical newbie shounen fan whose reference pool consists of 5-10 WSJ titles encounters their first-ever popular non-shounen, their mind explodes and they assume this must be some work of creative genius and originality, oblivious to how primitive and cliched it actually is. And those works always ARE primitive and cliched by definition - they wouldn’t come into a lowest common denominator’s field of vision without having the lowest common denominator appeal. It’s a well-known phenomenon with examples in every major genre. E.g. K-On is a baby’s first CGDCT, High School DxD is a baby’s first ecchi, Oregairu is a baby’s first harem romcom, Monster is a baby’s first psychological drama, etc, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
Well, being generic isn’t in itself a problem - being low-quality is. Let’s get back to the “secrets” premise. In KareKano the female lead poses as an honor student, but secretly is a vain bitch, and the male lead poses as a nice guy, but secretly is a rapey brooding bad boy (note: every male lead in shoujo is rapey, it’s a shoujo law). Okay, makes sense. Meanwhile in Horimiya, the female lead poses as a popular girl, but secretly is... a good elder sister swamped with chores? Wow, what a secret. And the male lead looks like a nerd, but secretly has tattoos and piercings... but is still a gentle and nice guy? It’s almost like the writer is a hack and just mindlessly copy-pasted the premise other shoujo series do without even understanding how it’s supposed to work.<br />
The series is crawling with all the usual suspects of shit writing, such as inconsistent tone (the show treats a male teacher making perverted comments about a student’s small boobs like a gag, thinks that it has any right to pretend to be grounded or dramatic after) - but by this point, I’m wasting my time arguing that water is wet. Those who have seen water should know it themselves, those who haven’t and aren’t familiar with the concept of “wet” won’t get it anyway.<br />
<br />
Tl;dr: another mainstream series hyped by manga readers as best thing ever turns out to be entry-level trash, who could’ve seen that coming.<br />

    Normally don&#039;t watch a lot of romance animes, or don&#039;t have a major interest in them. But this show is far different for me. To the point I&#039;m for sure am gonna read the manga afterwards because of how great I find it. It&#039;s one of the best of the season, and let me explain why.<br />
<br />
Story and characters<br />
The story follows a case of misjudging another, which leads to surprise interactions, which develops into a wonderful friendship. As we meet the actual Izumi, and not the one thought of by his classmates for years on end, believed to be an otaku, when really he&#039;s an average

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376637">
        guy with piecing and tattoos. Nothing dangerous, just a much more chill guy then imagined before, as he ends up looking after Hori&#039;s little brother and meeting Hori, who is beyond surprised by Izumi&#039;s appearance and who he truly is, and it&#039;s cute to see. It follows from there, as more within Hori&#039;s circle of friends end up knowing Izumi more, and it really feels like a Clannad style vibe of watching close friends together, really good stuff.<br />
<br />
The characters are interesting, and their interactions within the show are top notch. The 2nd episode in particular, with how Hori was acting, it was goofy, funny, and silly all in one. Highly entertaining. As for how they are in general, Hori is sweet and kind, very hardworking, but can have a little temper at times, but that&#039;s more down to being surprised and unsure on a few occasions. Izumi is super relatable in terms  of who he is, the average guy, who just kept to himself, and has very real feelings when dealing with all this new friendships placed upon him. While  their friends are very supportive in their own way. Really lovely stuff.<br />
<br />
Art and sound<br />
The art style is really great to look at, the colours are vibrant, where it be the backgrounds, or the characters themselves. It really does look lovely. Much like the sound is fit for purpose, and can&#039;t go wrong there.  It&#039;s dark when it wants to be, and very bright when it wants to be. It&#039;s heartwarming stuff.<br />
<br />
Horimiya is a standout of the season, and always look forward to it on a Saturday. Something you can put your feet up, with a cup of tea, and relax and enjoy some top quality entertainment. So go watch it now!

    A show containing the typical elements you would find in most Shoujo: the bishounen tropes where guys are drawn prettier than girls, colorful sparkling backgrounds for short scenes that are supposed to be cute and a school romance atmosphere intended to make the heart of teen girls go dokidoki depicting the usual (unrealistic) fantasies girls have around that age:<br />
<br />
- A boy that is a nice guy but at the same time has a &quot;rebel side&quot;: MC looks like a regular guy at school but wears piercings outside of school. How rebel is that, uh? Oh, his beauty level is also supposed to be increased dramatically

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376679">
        just by removing his glasses.<br />
<br />
- A boy that is calm but at the same time has a &quot;wild manly&quot; side: MC resorts to unnecessary violence and the whole thing is simply shrugged off with a puppy face saying &quot;I got a bit angry&quot; (you can imagine the girly screaming audience &quot;aww he can protecc&quot;)<br />
<br />
And generally speaking, an environment with multiple pretty boys where teen girls can choose their best husbando. There&#039;s almost no drama in this show, most issues being resolved quickly with maybe an occasional cat-fight between boys. The focus is mostly in &quot;cute&quot; moments while severely lacking in the comedy department.<br />
<br />
By the way, the deep secret or hidden identities of the main couple that you read in most synopsis texts for this anime is exactly as it&#039;s written, and nothing more: the boy has tattoos and piercings, and the girl does housework... and that&#039;s it. Why doing chores at your own house is worth mentioning as a secret identity? it&#039;s beyond me, but in case you were waiting for a deeper meaning, you will be disappointed.<br />
<br />
So what to do if you want to sell an average girly story in a competitive market? How about you put a label to it saying &quot;this is for young boys&quot;, maybe also throw in a creepy pervert teacher character to show up occasionally harassing his underage female students (because that&#039;s what young boys like to see, right?). Result: pure marketing genius.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re already a fan from the manga, please enjoy the anime adaptation and have fun choosing which one of the boys has the prettiest tongue. If you&#039;re new to this anime, please be aware that you may be mislead by the &quot;genre&quot; labels, the synopsis and the initial hype from manga fans.<br />
<br />
Overall, I cannot recommend this show.

    Horimiya had the potential to be a truly great series, but it immensely squandered it.<br />
<br />
I genuinely wanted to like everything about it from the story to its characters to its gorgeous aesthetics and visual directing. I truly desired to see this show as something deep, dynamic, wholesome, and metaphorical. I wanted to believe this was a series that can boast and fulfill its unique takes and subversions of the typical romcom genre. But as both an adaptation and an anime in general, Horimiya just simply failed to take care of the basic fundamentals.<br />
<br />
The story initally starts out fairly strong with the hooking premise of a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review389274">
        guy and a girl seemingly on opposite ends of the social spectrum. Kyouko Hori is the apex popular girl, the idol of the classroom, and a magnet for rumors and hearsay; energetic, outgoing, hardworking, and sometimes bad-tempered, she is the established tsundere female protagonist. Izumi Miyamura is the antisocial guy, the mellow and gloomy individual who’s hard to approach and have a proper conversation with. By chance, the two main protagonists discover each other’s secrets and soon develop a very close relationship as a result of them promising to keep those secrets to each other. This sort of setup isn’t that unusual, when you consider Toradora and KareKano’s existence. Except that in this case, Hori and Izumi’s secrets aren’t exactly something intriguing or anything worth hiding; Hori is just essentially like a mom figure within her household and is usually calm and non-abusive, while Izumi, when not in school, is practically a kind and very sociable bishounen figure who casually wear ear piercings and displays tattoos like it’s the most normal thing in the world. These are not things I can see worth covering up, as it doesn’t really make the two characters or their relationship particularly interesting and innovative as they could’ve been. Rather, these facets feels more like easy baiting and a dull excuse as a catalyst to start their romantic development. Nothing interesting story-wise really develops that encompasses those “secrets” of theirs, and their close friends and associates would eventually find out naturally, anyways, as the two’s relationship become more apparent and noticeable to others.<br />
<br />
Now here’s the most problematic part of Horimiya: the pacing. The god damn awful and discombobulated pacing. At first, the series would seem alright in terms of getting the audience intrigued by the bright-looking cast and how they interact; at around the halfway point, unfortunately, the narrative format quickly becomes repetitive and tiresome. Nearly every episode feels like a mashup of separate segments without a coherent overlying narrative, and only every now and then detours back to the primary storyline regarding the main couple. As a result, we get copious amounts of awkward jump cuts and really jarring siegeways between segments and episodes. The tone becomes inconsistent due to too many shifts and swings, to the point where the overall story can feel tone-deaf, especially with the long pauses between character dialogue. Without any orderly fashion, the development in the series actually feels both rushed and dragged, and any drama segments or silly comedic gags feels so contrived, redundant, and stale, failing to even contributing to building anything for the cast, either. Chunks of the narrative are compressed and/or cut in an attempt to shove an entire 100-140 chapters worth of storytelling from the source material into a mere 12-13 episodes. The main couple’s progression is cut down and feels inorganic, while the supporting cast’s own sidestories are almost completely ignored and reduced down to practically mere confetti that amounts of almost nothing significant other than letting us know that Hori and Miya aren’t the only god damn humans in the series. It’s so dumbfounding how the major points were placed as well. A third of the way in, we already have immense romantic feelings and a confession. Three episodes later, the two have intercourse. Yes, indeed, barely just over halfway through, the two have already taken their relationship that far, with nothing substantial or heavy enough developed prior. By the end of the series, only 1 cour long, we already have a marriage proposal and high school graduation. The anime just simply skipped all the way to the endgame, which isn’t surprising at all considering the reputation of CloverWorks, a studio well known for the wrong reasons when it comes to source material adaptation and story-pacing direction. I also think the writer may have just ran out of ideas at some point and just tossed in random run-of-the-mill gags you’d see in literally hundreds or thousands of other romantic comedy series.<br />
<br />
In terms of the characters, Horimiya’s cast of characters aren’t very impressive overall. While they may be initially come off as endearing, loveable characters, not much is truly fleshed out enough to really make a statement. Kyouko and Izumi’s characteristics, as mentioned before, turn out to be something not particularly fascinating or subversive. One thing I want to note: I found Kyouko’s masochist side rather perplexing and unnecessary. While I can understand it’s due to her being tired of being treated nicely due to her non-abusive nature, this dumb fetish often places her romantic relationship with Izumi in a really bad light, making it come off as toxic and abusive. While it’s funny initially, there’s obviously no point to it in terms of achieving the story’s initial objective, and it doesn’t add any positive element to the romance, either; in short, it’s akin to pointless fanservice. On top of that, Izumi’s own background (especially regarding him constantly seeing an image of his past other self) and established connections with other characters don’t seem to amount to enough, due to the story’s compression. As a result, Izumi’s backstory felt like something too conveniently placed to make him seem more compelling as someone who was almost completely antisocial due to some conveniently implemented backstory. In a multi-cour season, this would be better handled and developed to make Izumi more genuinely endearing as a main character, even if his background setup is too typical.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast genuinely seemed far more interesting in comparison, though not exactly anything groundbreaking or innovative, either. For one example, Yuki Yoshikawa is that “happy-go-lucky” girl who is almost always bubbly and easy to get along with, yet hides a more melancholy side of her that tries to hide negative emotions and feelings as much as possible. Such a character like that could’ve gotten much more expansion upon, as her characteristics make her interesting when it comes to her addressing her own romantic affections. Another example is Sakura Kouno; she is a hardworking and responsible student council member but struggles with her own self-confidence and self-worth. The two aforementioned supporting characters seem to genuinely have something more substantial and deep than the main couple in terms of “secrets” and a reason to have their own facades, as well as their own relationships with other members of the cast. Unfortunately, the anime merely glosses over their respective stories, finishing them within half an episode, leaving them and other non-main characters underdeveloped as mere abstractions in the background, often never showing up even once for a good amount of episodes, as the narrative exclusively caters to the main protagonist duo. Due to the anime’s inability to allow the story to explore all the recurring characters as much as possible, the latter all come off as archetypal caricatures.<br />
<br />
If there’s one thing I can’t really complain about regarding Horimiya, it’s the visual aesthetics. The animation implements a lot of visual metaphors quite nicely, especially in terms of characterizing Izumi’s mental transition in the opening theme visuals, from being initially dark, gloomy, and lonely, to being bright, lively, and blissful. Lots of colored shifting shadows and camera angle shots were able to accurately portray the mood and the inner emotions of the characters. The character designs are also very nice and look almost exactly like how they do in the manga. Aside from the occasional derpy deformed looks during the comedic segments and awkward standstills and pauses due to bad jump cuts, the visual department is quite fine. As for the sound department, it’s pretty typical. The OST isn’t exactly something to love, but at the very least it tries to properly convey and encompass the tone or emotions, even if the segments themselves don’t have enough weight to them at all. The voice-acting is also above-average; the voice actors put in notable effort though perhaps not enough in certain scenes (which is understandable due to how awkward it can feel with cutting corners); sadly though, that’s doesn’t amount to quite enough.<br />
<br />
As much as I initially enjoyed the show and actually defended its rapid disorientated pacing at one point early on, my experience with Horimiya went awry real quick. While I found much entertainment and amusement when the show is on its comedic segments despite the latter being essentially noncontributory, I often find myself really confused and taken back when trying to follow the romantic and dramatic developments in the series. When a show like this clearly doesn’t know if it wants to be more like a 4-koma episodic format or a more straightforward shounen romcom narrative, I can’t help but felt like I’ve been constantly misled, especially by moments, like Yuki and Sakura’s side stories, that were supposed to be far, far more evocative than how they were handled in anime form. In some of the more cringe moments, especially regarding Hori’s masochist side, while I may laugh a little bit, at the same time, I can’t help but wonder: what the actual f--- was the point of putting that? I don’t even want to start with the pacing Horimiya chose. The excruciating amount of jump cuts get irritating and obstructive, and don’t allow me to thoroughly take in the preceding segments, forcing me to adjust to each following one rightaway. I essentially was unable to get into a proper mood every time due to the random tone shifts, leaving me frustrated and disappointed each time an episode ends. By the time the series finally ended, I was left feeling like I was cheated out of what would’ve been a wholesome and fulfilling experience.<br />
<br />
In the end, Horimiya immensely faltered as both an anime and an adaptation due to the series’ inability to maintain something coherent and consistent with its story and cast. Considering the notable effort poured into its production, especially with the audiovisuals, it feels like yet another wasted effort by CloverWorks. As someone who has admittedly read the manga of this series, I can’t really suggest reading the latter, either, but I will say that it obviously at least handles the in-between stuff much better than whatever this tragic display of an adaptation did.

    I’ve been hearing about Horimiya manga for a while, yet it hasn’t caught my attention at all, then the anime aired, so I watched a couple of episodes out of pure curiosity, and it managed to totally and completely catch my attention.<br />
<br />
This show has provided me with everything you can expect from a GREAT romcom anime, it has top tier characters (Hori san + Miyamura), comedy, narrative, relationships, drama, romance, and more.<br />
<br />
The artwork is outstanding, as expected from CloverWorks, and the voice actors and actresses did a fantastic job as well.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m loving it, you would most likely love it, and I plan on continuing to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376651">
        love it.<br />
<br />
Highly recommended to all fans of romance, comedy, and drama.<br />

    This show is the definition of mid.<br />
<br />
The main premise of the show is that the main characters act differently outside of school.<br />
<br />
If that sounds interesting to you then go ahead, watch it.<br />
<br />
Episode 1 was bearable and had some potential but by the second episode, it was very clear what type of show this would be. It&#039;s another self-insert rom-com show; The quiet outcast boy who meets an attractive/popular girl who would in other circumstances, never interact with each other. The comedy in the first two episodes has no intelligence and consists of slapstick and yelling. While other romcoms that occupy the same slice of life

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376824">
        genre have quirks that garner interest such as Kaguya-sama or Aobuta, Horimiya does not. I would even go as far as saying this show has the most uninteresting premise and story of any slice of life anime I have watched.<br />
<br />
As I do with all shows I drop, I read the summary of the source material and found that the premise does not stray too far from the small dramas between characters that we saw in the first two episodes.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: I am not sure who the target audience of this show is but it definitely is not for me. The boring premise is outshined by many other anime that share the same tropes.<br />

    &quot;Hori is toxic&quot; &quot;Hori is a -phobe&quot; &quot;This anime deserves a 1 because of that ONE THING&quot; <br />
Those are the words you hear often if you live past the year of 2020 mostly thanks to Twitter. This take is typically comes from western &#039;audiences&#039;. Don&#039;t listen to those kind of takes for this anime/manga. Those come from close minded individuals who lack the understanding of context and most importantly, understanding that HUMANS ARE COMPLEX AND IMPERFECT PEOPLE. Especially in high school.<br />
If you are of High School age and STILL don&#039;t understand that people have different opinions, then you are going to fail in the real

          <span style="display: none;" id="review391292">
        world. Name one perfect human that has no flaws. I bet you $1 million you can&#039;t find one. Especially in anime. <br />
<br />
And that&#039;s the beauty of Anime. Subtlety and context are what create a rich and varying story/character. In order for any slice of life anime to sustain itself it has to invest highly in their characters to create a compelling story. <br />
<br />
The story revolves around two main characters Hori and Izumi. One is perfect, headstrong, and independent and the other has pretty much given up on the world and just going through the motions. Two extremes personalities of the spectrum &quot;unexpectedly&quot; cross paths and there is your foundation of this High School Slice of Life. The 6 supporting characters all fill in that personality spectrum in a good manner in my opinion. Like any HS Teen, they all have their strengths weaknesses and conflicts. It&#039;s so well rounded, you will most likely relate to 1 or 2 of the characters. <br />
<br />
For me, I had my Izumi phase during high school (bullied into depression) But I also had my Yuki phase (being SO considerate of others that you&#039;re willing to sacrifice your own happiness). I had felt the most connection with these two and actually experienced some of these experiences during High School and college. Being my age, I could write a 1000 page book of the highs and lows of my High School and College life. That&#039;s for another time of course. <br />
<br />
After being out of the Anime game for about 8 years, I wanted a soft hearted Slice of Life to ease me back in to the game. The website that i go to (not MAL) recommended this as apparently this is the most watched on their site. My all time favorite SoL is Toradora, and it completely has Toradora vibes. <br />
<br />
The formula set forth from Toradora is a great template if you are into this kind of anime. I don&#039;t know if its the nostalgia factor or my desire to do-over my high school life and not be that depressed guy that never had a true friend-for-life in school, but it kept me up all night wanting to finish the whole series in one sitting. <br />
<br />
That being said, the production value of the anime is pretty high and you can tell some serious money was invested in this series. I don&#039;t spoil myself by reading the manga first. Feel free to read the manga first if that is your thing, but as usual the anime not as fleshed out as the manga. <br />
<br />
If you are open-minded person that is smart enough to understand context, intent, and A JOKE, I highly recommend this anime if you appreciate the Slice of Life RomCom genre. It&#039;s very light hearted and invokes that typical &quot;I wish my high school life was like this anime&quot; vibe. <br />
<br />
If you are a closed-minded person that looks for reasons to be offended, don&#039;t come here. It&#039;s not for you. Read the 1 star &quot;this is toxic&quot; review for why. Its obvious they have never been in a relationship or ever had a human friend in real life. Don&#039;t be like this, it will make you a bitter and old. Learn forgiveness and find the good in everyone you meet. <br />
<br />
Its the first anime I&#039;ve seen in 8 years and it definitely did not disappoint. If you are looking for a date night anime or an anime to introduce to your normie friend that enjoys RomComs. I HIGHLY SUGGEST HORIMIYA<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
TL;DR - Not everything is perfect, and success comes through hard work. Relationships are not one sided and require support and compromise from both sides. Before quickly judging someone based on your emotions, understand the context and intent. Humans are complex animals. <br />

    I have mixed feelings toward Horimiya, mainly due to its inconsistency. One day the comedies fine, the characters are likeable, and the extremely generic story doesn’t feel problematic; while the next day the comedies gone stale, the characters feel as basic as the storyline, and I’m dying at the contrived drama. Majority of the time, it’s the latter. It feels like they blatantly don’t know what they’re doing. But there’s still something in Horimiya that managed to keep me invested, despite the aforementioned complaints. I’ll try to break down both sides of the spectrum throughout this review, since I’m split down the middle.<br />
<br />
Horimiya started off

          <span style="display: none;" id="review389246">
        super strong. At first glance, I was intrigued by the characters. The whole concept of “not judging people off their appearances” was interesting, and I wanted to see where they went with it. When we first see Miyamura, we’re made to see him as a gloomy shut-in without any social life. But it turns out he’s the complete opposite. I really liked this idea, because I think this is an important moral that can be used in the real world. But as each episode progressed, this unique concept turned bland and generic, to the point where it was hardly bearable. It’s an emulation of every rom-com in existence, and it fails to add anything distinctive to separate it from the countless contemporaries in its genre. A tsundere main heroine and a slightly dense MC fall in love. Sounds like most of the other rom-com anime I’ve seen. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it failed to engage me any further, and it had nothing memorable about it. The pacing was extremely irregular, adapting 15 volumes in 13 episodes. Along with that, rather than feeling intense or emotional, most of the drama added in felt forced and cringey. I feel like the story completely fell flat, and that’s where Horimiya gets the most criticism.<br />
<br />
On the plus side, there were infrequent times where I did enjoy the characters, regardless of how basic they are. I always love watching relationships blossom, whether it be romantically or not. In Horimiya, we see Miyamura build tons of relationships. Not only with Hori, but he builds friendships with people he never expected he would have. He fights back the previous hardships he had with his social life, and learns to overcome it. It’s hard to not like Miyamura, and I feel like Horimiya did a great job in making us feel connected to him. His interactions with others are fun, and sometimes super wholesome. We also get to witness things through some supporting characters’ point of view. Though I felt that the supporting characters were forgettable and uninteresting (besides Tooru and Yuki, I love them!), it was still great to see them develop. With better pacing, the character department could have improved to greater heights.<br />
<br />
One thing that I have no complaints about is the art. The art felt crisp, and it looked gorgeous. The character designs aren’t anything outstanding, but they’re still appealing in their own way. Each character stands out with their own, unique hair color/style. One of the reasons I felt any enjoyment to this show was due to the artsyle. As for the sound, I also have no complaints. Nothing in that department stood out, but it was passable enough to avoid any issues.<br />
<br />
Horimiya isn’t anything special, but sometimes a basic story isn’t a fault. But there were definitely times where the comedy ran dry and some arbitrary drama forced its way into the story. The pacing was also extremely bad, but compared to the massacre which was TPN S2 (which also aired during this winter season, also made by CloverWorks), this was a little less bad. But all that aside, by no means do I think Horimiya was terrible, and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy some episodes. That’s where this inconsistency factor takes play. In short, if you’re planning to watch Horimiya, don’t expect anything too special. <br />

    Have you identified yourself with any characters? Visual, psychological, habits and customs are aspects that we develop since our birth and we constantly relearn. Some are more notable, even those who are not friends can see that you wore a different outfit or cut your hair. But there are other identities that are not easily understood, from the emotional side, to the introspective, something that many hide, whether through fear, trauma or insecurity. Horimiya is not just a famous novel that adapted a popular manga ... Not really ... It is about how jovial aspects are put into conflict and changes, where interpersonal relationships are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review389269">
        fundamental to mature and reform what we call life.<br />
<br />
On one side of this show, we have Hori-san (or Kyouko). Hori is the outgoing girl in her class. With an enviable beauty and high scores on exams, she appears to be a peaceful and happy person with her life. In fact, even her closest friends find this, especially Yoshikawa, her best friend. Hori does not present a weakness and, in fact, it is even more than that. She cares for her brother more than her own mother and this prospect of family relationships is what bothers Hori. It is not because she feels forgotten by her family, but it is because she does not provide for her affections with her own relatives. It is a relatively easy difficulty, but for Hori, even a fever can remind her of the lack of empathy her parents gave her. Hori lives his life happily and tries to make up for it by making his friends and colleagues happy, in addition to his brother, of course (the charm of the anime).<br />
<br />
On the other side is Miyamura. He is the protagonist who has the most qualities to be presented throughout the series. Miyamura is very reserved at school and is considered the smart boy and otaku of the class. However, he doesn&#039;t even fit that social etiquette. In fact, Miyamura hides a complex that ranges from acceptance among his friends to rebellion due to personal problems and impulsiveness. Miyamura is an embodiment that spans many people. How many times, at school, have we had a friend with some kind of difficulty in meeting, either in a social group, or even in relating to do a school activity? Miyamura is not much different from someone who has been conditioned since childhood to become a &quot;stranger&quot;. He finds his freedom from the moment he puts on his piercings and fixes his hair, becoming a very attractive young man and possibly would be one of the most popular in the school if he kept that stripped-down look in the study areas. Miyamura has not been in years and Hori is the girl who helps him to reverse this discomfort.<br />
<br />
&quot;But ... What about the rest of the show? The anime just centers Hori and Miya and forms&quot; Horimiya &quot;at the end and is everything okay?&quot; ~ No, my friend. Horimiya is not just that. Of course, much of the show is focused only on the duo, whether with conflicts between other people or not. Still, many characters are fun to keep up with. Yoshikawa and Ishikawa are the other most influential duo in the franchise. Both have a temperament that balance and at the same time unbalance the series. His coexistence with the protagonists forms a fruitful and friendly circle of friendship in Horimiya. Of course, the four characters together are not the best example of a &quot;perfect romcom group&quot; that exists, there are better ones (as in Toradora, one of the anime that hit the most in this regard), but the show manages to use the secondary characters very well , with the objective of producing a good environment and security for the most intimate interaction of the protagonists, after all, there is no way to have confidence in a love relationship without a witness. It is necessary to talk and vent about your indifference and difficulties with someone. This show has a good reception in that factor. Of course, the student council group and the other friends are also very presentable, but in general, it is not very necessary to define the real importance of everyone. What can be said is that the influences of Hori and Miya&#039;s friends move them constantly, even if this is a vicious and uninteresting cycle. Still, it is a sign of maturity. The couple, even if formed throughout the series, does not present a completely real relationship. It is necessary to go further into mutual feelings, which come from a reaffirmation of their love, to the smallest gestures. Horimiya went on a lot to be a show with this kind of general accomplishment, just like a baby crawls to be able to find a new toy. And the show got it right this time.<br />
<br />
And this is how a romcom appears ...<br />
<br />
In fact, Horimiya is not a very easy show to please everyone. In fact, the subjects of anime are not intended and function to be a complete beautiful and cute story about love between teenagers. It is often noticeable that the anime is much more about the relationships of the group itself that involves Hori, Miya and their friends. Things like romance, passion and sentimentality are timidly explored until they reach their peak. Horimiya does this with mastery. Referring me to Horimiya (manga), I questioned the reliability of the quality of the story, and it is understandable to understand who does not like the show. The romance genre is one of the most subjective there is. Even more so when it involves comedy or drama. Horimiya compiles the three callsigns in a single show and adapts an extensive list of approximately 130 chapters with prowess. Honestly, CloverWorks has suffered a lot in the past three months. His confidence was in bringing the sequel to The Promissed Neverland, which was overshadowed by a pathetic adaptation of his original material. In fact, Neverland has become a joke, a disappointment more than unanimous. Wonder Egg Priority arrived as a surprise, no one imagined that a show with interesting themes would be presented these days. However, its outcome is still a mystery. It does not bring a certainty of the complete quality of the show (although it really did positively, anyway). Horimiya was the only one of the three who really delivered a rewarded expectation. It was a surprise to see that 13 episodes would form a whole history of the franchise. Those who remember the OVA&#039;s and the first manga would not imagine that this adaptation would be questioned. However, it is undeniable that the studio and the direction of the show delivered the best they could. It is not really normal to adapt so much history in a small plot. But we already know many shows that have become very problematic due to their comparisons with serialization in magazines. Domestic na Kanojo and Nisekoi are great examples of this.<br />
<br />
I must admit that I did not expect this show to have enough qualities to be one of the best of 2021, after all, it is still the beginning of the year, but it was definitely a sure strategy to adapt the show early on. The show already has a significant importance in its popularity and general tastes. In addition to being a visually great anime, it&#039;s really great to admire the qualities that the adaptation dared to do. Not just any movie, series or anime can do that, especially in a world full of entertainment content. Many shows are lost in not delivering something of the highest possible quality. Horimiya surely achieved this feat. It is a show that I take to my heart forever. I want to consume and absorb more of this work! If you are too, the manga can be a great continuity to venture further into the franchise, after all, a spontaneous school romcom is always welcome !!

    This will be my second review, also on a show I don’t like. After watching the latest episode (10) I simply couldn’t wait any longer. Although if the ending is beyond a masterpiece, the show is just that bad. This show is literally an inside joke among my friend group because of how bad it is.<br />
<br />
I won’t go on too long since I don’t like long reviews<br />
<br />
Story 2/10 they have some kind of idea of what they’re doing in the first 4 episodes but the rest is just introducing new characters with filler like content. They focus on character to character with no apparent changes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review384333">
        after. Except for Miyamura cutting his hair and overcoming his anxiety of course. Then they just make up bad scenarios an troubles to get to 13 episodes. This anime is truly carried by the art. I really don’t understand why it has such high budget or rating.<br />
<br />
Art 9/10 exactly as Sao this anime’s art is top notch. Probably the only thing that makes this show watchable<br />
<br />
Sound 7/10 good sounds not really much more to say about it<br />
<br />
Characters 2/10 as I said in the story section characters just exist, we barely don’t know anything about Miyamura yet which makes the impact that much worse when I don’t even care about him. There is not a minute in the entire show where a character doesn’t do anything stupid or illogical. I have found myself having to scream irl because their logic is so dumb.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 4/10 as I said earlier, this anime is an inside joke in my friend group so am kinda enjoying clowning on it and the animation makes it watchable but man sometimes I just want to drop the show.<br />
<br />
Overall 3/10 please don’t write hate manga readers, I just think the anime is dog poo!

    When watching Horimiya one question constantly grazes through my head; if only. If only they had given ANY time for character development and backstory before making the relationship progress rapidly in minutes, maybe then I could actually care about the characters. It&#039;s laughable that the premise is *oh my god this girl and boy who look a certain way at school actually have completely different personalities!* - why is it laughable? The premise is done and explored within the first 4 minutes of episode one. It doesn&#039;t even give the viewer time to fully grasp the preconceived self of the mc&#039;s, no it does not.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377682">
        Instead it serves as nothing better than the synopsis so when not explored, IT MEANS NOTHING! Everything in Horimiya is meaningless fluff. It&#039;s a speed run of a romance story, which is why I can&#039;t engage or connect with any of the characters nor plot points. I need time to care, to understand why this relationship is so important. There&#039;s nothing to grasp onto in Horimiya. Nothing to make me remember the anime for years to come, nothing that will make it remain a relevant classic for years to come, nothing that makes it more than another mid romance anime. It&#039;s as 4/10 a show as you can find. If you want nothing more than meaningless fluff, which due to the massive hype it&#039;s evident most of the community do, then great, here&#039;s your meaningless fluff. I must say that I actually was really excited for Horimiya, I&#039;ve heard from countless people it&#039;s fantastic, one of the greats. I can&#039;t speak for the manga, though I&#039;m told it&#039;s much the same but even when taking Horimiya with a grain of salt, I can&#039;t help but feel more disappointed than I have for a while. It&#039;s rare for a romance anime to take the spotlight these days, and with only a bit of effort, it could have meant stuff, it could have been MEANINGFUL fluff, but instead I&#039;m stuck here saying if only, whilst I watch yet another mediocre show.

    Horimiya is a good anime to watch if you&#039;re feeling bored, very lighthearted and enjoyable. So far no complaints, but my issue is... why is it ranked so high?<br />
<br />
While it isn&#039;t a bad anime and the first episodes hooked me and made me wait for more, the story as a whole is nowhere near memorable. The characters are generic, the development is incredibly fast paced and after 7 episodes it feels like there&#039;s nothing more to tell to the story. It feels like any basic romcom, except the comedy is almost nonexistent. There isn&#039;t really any flow to it and at this point the story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review382589">
        was told. Done. I can&#039;t really imagine what more can happen in another 5 episodes. <br />
<br />
The reason why it&#039;s ranked #77 is beyond my understanding, considering i wouldn&#039;t give it more than a 6, maybe 7. The art and sound are, again, nothing special. But each to their own I guess.<br />
<br />
Do I recommend it? If you got nothing else to do and you want something light to watch, then you should give it a try. It&#039;s forgettable, but at least you can enjoy it for a short amount of time before you move to another anime.

    Romcom is a tricky genre. It&#039;s hard to tell exactly what you are getting just by looking at the synopsis. Most of the times, you get your generic romcom with intolerable characters, and at other times, you find something like Horimiya.<br />
<br />
For quite a long time, Horimiya has been a pretty massive name in the manga community, but it wasn&#039;t until recently that it started garnering attention from the anime viewers. Despite what some people may believe, the 2021 adaptation of Horimiya isn&#039;t actually its first anime adaptation. Before this, an OVA based on the much less popular web comic was released 8 years ago, which

          <span style="display: none;" id="review389270">
        didn&#039;t gain much attention. But after a new anime adaptation based on the more popular manga began airing, it pretty much immediately received widespread popularity among anime fans. Since then, Horimiya has also become somewhat of a divisive series—with people falling in love with the anime and others finding it very mediocre. As for me, I&#039;m kinda in the first group.<br />
<br />
Now, before I talk about why I like Horimiya, it&#039;s necessary to point out the show&#039;s most notable flaw: the premise.<br />
<br />
Kyouko Hori is a smart and beautiful girl who is loved by all her friends. On the other hand, Izumi Miyamura is a rather gloomy guy who always stays isolated from others. When these two meet each other by chance, they discover each other&#039;s secrets or, as they call it, &quot;hidden selves&quot;. Hori and Miyamura decide to hide each and grow closer as they interact.<br />
<br />
What are these secrets, exactly? Miyamura&#039;s secret actually needs to be kept a secret—dude&#039;s got piercings and stuff, you know? But Hori&#039;s secret is.... She is a normal girl who loves to do housework and takes care of her little brother.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I don&#039;t know what about it is unusual either.<br />
<br />
The premise here is an obvious gimmick, and it solely exists to get things rolling. It&#039;s not necessarily a bad thing in of itself, but Horimiya makes this painfully obvious. After the first few episodes, the premise is pretty much entirely forgotten. Aside from initiating Hori and Miyamura&#039;s relationship, it doesn purpose and doesn&#039;t affect the story in any way. As pointless (and stupid) as the premise is, though, Horimiya itself isn&#039;t actually a bad show.<br />
<br />
The narrative of Horimiya is mostly character-driven, so it mainly depends on its characters to move the story forward. This causes some obvious downsides, perhaps the notable one being how mundane the show can become at times. But fortunately, there is a cast of lively characters that compensate for the lacklustre story. The content is pretty light-hearted in nature, and while there&#039;s a fair amount of drama from time to time (which honestly need some work), the anime mostly maintains a wholesome and &quot;feel-good&quot; atmosphere that works very well for it.<br />
<br />
It should be obvious by reading the title (Horimiya = Kyouko &quot;Hori&quot; &amp; Izumi &quot;Miya&quot;mura), but the main focus of Horimiya are the two titular characters: Hori and Miyamura. Hori and Miyamura initially started out as close friends, and they became lovers after they confirmed their feelings for each other. However, unlike many other romcoms, the series doesn&#039;t take an unnecessarily long time to bring them together, which gives it more than enough time to effectively delve into their romantic relationship and strengthen their bond through simple yet entertaining interactions.<br />
<br />
Hori and Miyamura&#039;s romantic relationship starts off as slightly toxic with Hori being overly possessive of Miyamura, but it becomes much, much less prevalent in the later episodes. Both Hori and Miyamura have genuine feelings for each other, and they reflect that through their heartfelt conversations. Their interactions are mostly bubbly and light-hearted, being proof their healthy relationship. They do engage in sexual intercourse in one episode, but it&#039;s only implied rather than being explicitly shown.<br />
<br />
Hori&#039;s first impressions may not be very promising. She is seemingly a typical tsundere character who is good at everything she does, but she soon develops into a more complex character. Like any normal girl, Hori has her own insecurities (her so called secret isn&#039;t one of them), and through Miyamura, she can expose her insecurities and be nonchalant about them. Miyamura is a very significant part of Hori&#039;s life and vice-versa; both of them complement to each other just by being themselves.<br />
<br />
Miyamura is almost the polar opposite of Hori. He doesn&#039;t stand out much (or stands out in a negative regard), he is pretty much always gloomy, and he barely has any &quot;real&quot; friends. He always stays isolated from others, trying to avert any sort of attention towards him. However, Hori&#039;s arrival in his life has changed him in more ways than one. Because of her, Miyamura has finally started to make friends and open up to them, and he is very, very grateful to her for that. His gloominess isn&#039;t all there is to him, though. He is genuinely a nice and funny guy who you would love to be friends with. (By the way, I really like his &quot;gangsta&quot; or &quot;yakuza&quot; type of attitude.)<br />
<br />
While strong in romance and comedy, Horimiya falls short in the more serious side of things. As I said earlier, there is a fair amount of dramatic content in the series, and more often than not, it comes out a bit sappy (to me, at least). For instance, Miyamura&#039;s past is one of the most prominent themes of Horimiya. Every now and then, flashbacks of his past school life are shown where we see him all dispirited, but any proper reason for him to behave like that is never given. We know Miyamura used to be a hella depressed kid, but we don&#039;t know why and how he became so depressed, which makes it difficult to find him relatable. However, Miyamura does confront his past later on in the anime, and how he comes to terms with it is wholesome and encouraging, and presented greatly.<br />
<br />
Horimiya&#039;s supporting cast is pretty memorable, predominantly consisting of Hori and Miyamura&#039;s friends, most of whom are quite likeable. From time to time, however, the focus of the story changes to the side characters from the main duo, from which a couple of issues stem. The shift of the focus mostly works well, but sometimes, they are rather abrupt and completely take the spotlight from Hori and Miyamura, especially apparent in the last half. At times, the dramatic content concentrating on the side characters can be very redundant. Like, what was the point of the love triangle between Yuki, Tooru and Sakura? Not much. Horimiya also has a tendency to suddenly introduce new characters (Sawada and Motoko for example) and focus on them right away, which does it more harm than good.<br />
<br />
The animation of Horimiya is fairly good. It isn&#039;t particularly breathtaking or the like, but it&#039;s more than satisfactory for the most part. The backgrounds are fine, but the artstyle and character designs are certainly noteworthy; they are simple but the clever use of vivid and flashy colors makes them stand out a lot (especially the hair colors). Though, the anime likes to use certain effects while showing specific character reactions (like overly saturated and shady backgrounds), which is aesthetically cool and all, but I couldn&#039;t find much meaning behind them. They came off as kinda tacky to me.<br />
<br />
In terms of soundtrack, Horimiya does a quite satisfactory job. While nothing too remarkable, the music overall complements to the experience of the show. The opening theme &quot;Iro Kousui&quot; is one of the catchiest songs of the season, paired with a gloomy sequence focusing on Miyamura. In the last half, the sequence changes a bit after Miyamura and Hori get together, highlighting the happy moments of his new life. On the other hand, the ending theme &quot;Yakusoku&quot; is fairly inferior to the opening song, but it is paired with rather unique and creative visuals. The voice acting is very good as well.<br />
<br />
Horimiya doesn&#039;t really bring anything new to the table per se, but it&#039;s good at what it does to say the least. Even with its flaws, it&#039;s mostly a humorous and heartwarming romcom that manages to be better than most of its peers. While I can&#039;t really recommend the show to everyone due to its rather mundane nature, romcom fans like me are likely to find something special in it and appreciate it for what it is. After all, a genuinely good romcom is hard to find these days.
