    Megalobox S1 was like your typical shonen anime where the underdog fights to be the best. Nomad is like One Punch Man where you get to see what happens to the protagonist after he reached his goal. The story is very realistic and the characters have a lot of development. <br />
<br />
One of the very underrated anime for sure. I never thought a sequel to Megalobox would be this good. I want people to watch more anime like this than shonen all the time.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s frustrating to see that Nomad is the 5th highest rated show in Spring 2021. Should be in the top 3.

    &quot;As the wind whirled by, a Hummingbird appeared before the Nomad as they made their way through the wasteland.<br />
<br />
Hummingbird: Will you listen to my song, Nomad? I&#039;m in a hurry, ask someone else.<br />
<br />
But the Hummingbird just won&#039;t give up and pursued the Nomad.<br />
<br />
Hummingbird: Please, I must sing my song.<br />
Nomad: You&#039;re rather selfish. Sorry, but I&#039; m just not in the mood. I&#039;m on a journey to die.<br />
Hummingbird: But that&#039;s ridiculous. Who goes on a journey to die?<br />
Nomad: It&#039;s the truth. Why would I bother lying before I die?<br />
<br />
But the hummingbird refused to give up.<br />
<br />
Hummingbird: Then how about this? If I can make you lie, listen

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404946">
        to my song. If I fail to do so, I will say no more.<br />
<br />
Wanting to be freed from the persistent pest, the Nomad agreed.<br />
<br />
Hummingbird: Why do you want to die?<br />
Nomad: Because I lost everything.<br />
Hummingbird: That&#039;s a lie.<br />
Nomad: But it&#039;s not a lie. I lost my home, my fortune...and my family died from illness. I&#039;ve got nothing left.<br />
Hummingbird: No, you still have eyes to see me and ears to hear my song. You even have a mouth to speak to me.<br />
Nomad: Yes, you&#039;re right.<br />
<br />
Though they felt that they had been duped, the Nomad admitted defeat.<br />
<br />
Nomad: All right, I lose.<br />
<br />
The Nomad didn&#039;t want any more trouble, and stopped to hear the Hummingbird&#039;s song. The voice was so beautiful that it filled the Nomad&#039;s empty heart with a gentle warmth just for a moment.<br />
<br />
After it had finished its song, the Hummingbird flew towards the ray of sunlight that was peeking through the clouds.&quot;<br />

Redemption. The most successful and decorated Olympian of all time, Michael &quot;Flying Fish&quot; Phelps, sums the one word this way: &quot;Perseverance, determination, commitment, and courage-those things are real. The desire for redemption drives you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Going back to Megalo Box, the prequel being a creation and a homage to the 50th anniversary of Ashita no Joe a.k.a Tomorrow&#039;s Joe, was a fun watch when the anime first debuted in Spring 2018, but quickly faded into obscurity for it being like a stereotypical Shounen anime where the underdog fights his way through all the underground boxing ring matches, to then rise up and be a formidable foe. Even I&#039;ll admit that going back to Season 1 now, just feels like the re-watch has made the experience much worse and a slog to finish this &quot;boxing&quot; anime.<br />
<br />
But the sequel here, dubbed Megalo Box 2: Nomad? NOW THIS IS A 100% GAME CHANGER of anything but everything that we haven&#039;t yet seen before. And apparently the production team behind the prequel also thought of it the exact same way with director You Moriyama, whom producer Minako Fujiyoshi had to convince him to do so, thinking that the prequel by itself is an open-and-shut case. Rather than make yet another season of staying with the whole &quot;tribute to the past&quot; thingie-a-bob (which was what attributed to the less-than-stellar feedback in both Japan and the West at the time), the staff team scrapped that idea, and went for a more mature theme that displays the post events of Gearless Joe in a long timeskip of 7 years, where everyone has matured and Joe&#039;s fall from grace as a depressed adult post-Megalonia. Instead of sticking to the same &quot;Ashita no Joe&quot; guns that bullets could crack for its own niche, the production staff team went for a more independent work which incoporates real-life societal issues, while still following Joe as he travels from place to place, while simultaneously not being able to move on from his past friends and rivals. AND BOY DOES IT SHOW, I&#039;d say this change greatly increased the impact that boxing anime fans have been craving for the longest time.<br />
<br />
If anything, this Nomad sequel proves one crucial thing that is missing from the prequel: character development IS KING, neither the boxing matches (though since this is a boxing anime at its core, it has to be there) nor the impact of wins or losses. As such, Nomad starts out differently than your average sequel, giving it the vibe sense that the world of the past is present, but you cannot always look back to your glory days and make the same results again. And that&#039;s Gearless Joe&#039;s re-account of his mature life being the Nomad: the one who wanders around with no goal in sight.<br />
<br />
Need I mention that Nomad itself is more complex (as foreshadowed by the production team), but still reigniting the same flame of nostalgia? Because that is what it is: the Gearless Joe is not the same Gearless Joe 7 years later, and has largely kept to a low-profile state after losing out to Yuri&#039;s young successor Edison Liu, leading to his recluse life under painkiller drugs and earning money from his old ways of underground boxing matches. If you&#039;re wondering why I&#039;d mention a &quot;nonsensical&quot; story in the beginning of this review, &quot;The Nomad and the Hummingbird&quot; is essentially the mature-but-depressed and delusional Joe&#039;s road from cradle to death, then riding the road to redemption, and it is a crucial pointer in the progression of the sequel. Through the same-old and new characters that are like character arcs in and of itself (and outstanding ones at that), these people will teach Joe the meaning of life, and what it meant by getting through all the trouble of being an outcast and making the most out of the new life, setting new goals, objectives and aspirations for the future. Seriously though, never have I been so captivated by a character-centric story so jarring, yet is intensely intriguing and hits at the heartstrings like a solemn foreign song played on the guitar. You can never find a better original story like this that is done through much of the production staff team&#039;s back-and-forth multiple discussions about the new Gearless Joe and his mature characterization, but fix as much as they can it did to give it an edge that I can say, is on a much higher pedestal than any typical &quot;underdog to champion&quot; fame kind of boxing show.<br />
<br />
Mature being the theme of Nomad, and of course, with such a huge timeskip, Joe and the kids of Team Nowhere have matured A WHOLE LOT. We all know what happened to Joe, but in the course of events, his manager-cum-coach Nanbu...shall I say, had some life complications to the point that Sachio and crew thought that Joe was solely at fault when he &quot;abandoned&quot; them for his own gain when going against the former No. 1&#039;s student successor (Edison Liu). Needless to say, all of that was a recipe for disaster, as the tables had drastically turned on Joe: the loss of his Megalonia &quot;champion&quot; status, and Sachio with the Team Nowhere kids exiting Joe&#039;s life thereafter. 7 years later, everyone obviously grows up, but Joe&#039;s fame got so much on his head that the loss subjected him to post-natal depression. Overtime, the new characters Chief (an Afro-Latino immigrant) and Mac &quot;The Hero&quot; Rosario (brought in as the new technological face of boxing Gear) encounters Joe, fights him, and teaches each other about what their human values are worth fighting for, hence the symbolism of  &quot;The Nomad and the Hummingbird&quot;, which explicitly interchanges the roles between the three Megaloboxers (once in each character arc), educating them and edifying the meaning of &quot;coming home to the family&quot;. Even if all is lost, your family will still be right beside you, even through the course of life and death. And you know that I ABSOLUTELY LOVE symbolisms in shows, and Nomad does an outstanding job at reading between the lines when it comes to characterization of the tightly packed and immaculate kind.<br />
<br />
TMS Entertainment is back to produce this show (without the help of its subsidary 3xCube which also produced the classic Ashita no Joe), but this time, the old-school style animation is largely improved for the better. Even Joe&#039;s VA Yoshimasa Hosoya was surprised at the improved animation, and quote-unquote &quot;was surprised by the improved animation which he felt to be more fit of a movie rather than a TV series&quot;. Season 1 wasn&#039;t bad, but the asinine tight production schedule, other than the tribute of sampling full HD to old 480p visuals, made it truly stand out in its time. Season 2 here is largely more of the same, though I&#039;d guess that 3 years of production development is more than enough time to make this sequel work its legs to kick out wonders. It is an unique mold, all on its own.<br />
<br />
Even the music by famed composer mabanua is back with more of the same-old, old-school style instrumentals, but incorporating with Mexican-Spanish themes. Such as the OP &quot;The theme of the Nomad&quot; which is meant to sound like a glorification of Gearless Joe&#039;s better days in mono, to the Latin-American ED &quot;El Canto del Colibrí&quot; (translated as &quot;The Hummingbird&#039;s Song&quot;) in full Spanish Tejano &quot;folk&quot; style music, meant as a song of the hummingbird, seen as a messenger of the gods used to convey good and peaceful thoughts to kin about their loved ones, dead or alive. And even as much as I miss LEO Imai&#039;s hyper OP &quot;Bite&quot; of the prequel, this narrative shift of a sequel does not need all the barking and biting hype, and settles for the comtemporaries to add the classic punch to the impact.<br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s insane to see a famed sequel like Megalo Box 2: Nomad, be so shunned by the community, because other than it being a vastly superior sequel, it can also be taken in as an independent work all by itself. Providing the fact that you have to bear through the decent prequel to get to this sequel, I can safely tell you that the wait is worth the trouble.<br />

    Anime that mixes science fiction and sports drama together aren&#039;t very common these days. When you throw characters into a boxing ring, it becomes more of a sensation because you konw, someone is going to get hurt. No, I don&#039;t just mean getting hurt in the fight. I mean, someone is going to risk their pride on the line in front of the world. Megalo Box returns for a surprising sequel in Spring 2021.<br />
<br />
Indeed, Megalo Box getting a second season almost feels like a miracle. Joe has been established as a character with integrity but also one we came to understand and relate to. From

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404977">
        this season, we see a change in his character, including his name. Now going by the name &#039;Nomad&#039;, the first episodes explores his psychological state of mind and how he lives his new life. Taking place roughly 7 years since the first season, we see Joe living his life not with luxury but one who tries to get by everyday, almost like a survivor. He relies on painkillers that translates into a sort of dangerous addiction. This self-destructive behavior shows that Joe has a hard time letting his past go. The painkillers he takes feeds on his mind to forget, even if it&#039;s damn impossible.<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s the beauty about Nomad: Megalo Box 2. This show is so much more than about throwing punches in a ring. We start off this season with heavy drama that deals with sensitive topics in the sports competitive world. Let&#039;s also not forget that despite Joe trying to keep a low profile to himself, he still possess competitive skills in the ring. Sure, he may not be at his prime but Joe hasn&#039;t lost his touch either. From the first few episodes, we also meet Chief, a character who inspires Joe to once again rise up and be himself. It&#039;s not until a life changing event later when Joe decides to truly move on from his past. Chief represents the source of power that Joe needed this season. He&#039;s been running from his past and if it wasn&#039;t for Chief, his future would be grim, perhaps even nonexistent. For this season, it gave us a deep dive into Joe&#039;s psychological mind, about how he&#039;s been dealing with Nanbu&#039;s death, and how he moves on. Joe&#039;s worst enemy is himself and it&#039;s important to see how manages to defeat it.<br />
<br />
Joe isn&#039;t the only character who underwent changes. One of the more prominent characters who underwent a character change is Sachio, a young boy who has now grown up as a teenager also getting involved as a Megaloboxer. But no mistake, he isn&#039;t as skilled as Joe, Yuri, or any other of the elite fighters. More importantly is his feelings towards Joe and how he seem him this season. Other important characters making their appearances includes Edision Liu, a man who wants to prove himself and to Joe that he is a true Megaloboxer. On the other hand, we also meet Mac, a Megaloboxer who draws in some parallel similarities to Joe in his quest of redemption. The season even goes through his past life and how he became where he is in he present time. Even more interesting is how we see technology can influence a person&#039;s life, most noticably Mac. You have to know that fighting in a ring with a robotic arm and gears has its risks. This season turns up to the 11 when we realize the real consequences, with Mac being the perfect example of telling and showing.<br />
<br />
If you believe in this show to succeed, you&#039;re going to need some patience especially with the story pacing. The first half of this sequel is more about Joe&#039;s personal recovery from his past and move on with his life. The second half draws in more about the boxing world&#039;s truths and consequences. It also sets up for a mega confrontation between perhaps two of the series&#039; biggest names: Joe and Mac. The latter is a character that isn&#039;t easy to accept at first but over time, the show truly wants us to understand his character. And indeed, Mac&#039;s personality and characterization gives us a deeper insight not just about him but also the Megalo Box world. How can we ever forget the dystopian society that differs so greatly between the wealthy and the poor? When I came into this season, I knew this show would do a lot more than just show us a memorable boxing match. <br />
<br />
Similar to the previous season, we got the crude yet aesthetic art style we were familiar with. The most memorable quality relies on Joe&#039;s physical features, showing his longer, dirtier hair. His character expressions were also more depressed until he meets Chief. Speaking of which, Chief himself shows traits of a leader and mentor. His general composition and personality is reflected in his expressive dialogues. To say the least, we managed to get a very human story with characters driven by certain ambitions. As with a sci-fi dystopia, the technology in this show has both a simple yet complex way of selling its product. The robotics and technology adds credibility to the unique style of Megalo Boxing. Every move in that ring shows what the capability of such technology in this timeline and by no understatement, it&#039;s a sight to remember. The director and producers managed to truthfully animate this season with a goal in mind and that goal was achieved.<br />
<br />
Megalo Box may seem like a simple sci-fi sports drama show at first but it proves itself to be a complex storyteller. From the deep character development of Joe/Nomad to the storytelling of Mac, it shows how people can change or influenced by certain people or events. This season may not be very easy to jump into at first but you won&#039;t regret taking that step to live the dream again.

    A happily ever after doesn’t exist. <br />
<br />
Nomad takes the cheerful conclusion of the first season and throws it down the gutter. Gearless Joe. A man who had reached his peak early in life, is left stumbling into a downward spiral. What’s left after a few years is a lone man with nothing. Wandering on without a destination. Getting money the only way he knows how. A stray dog now more than ever before. <br />
<br />
A continuation of a story whose ending, albeit not perfect, felt complete, could very well have been just a way to milk a pre-existing series dry. But I was glad to see

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404948">
        that wasn’t the case here. Nomad doesn’t use the first season as a crutch, but as a foundation to build off of. <br />
<br />
The uplifting nature of season one is replaced with a much more somber tone. Joe who had previously been fighting for his future, now fights to handle the pain of his past. It’s in stark contrast to where we last saw him in his life, but not a bad direction to take his character. Of the whole first season&#039;s cast, he was definitely one of the least interesting ones. He’s a blatant representation of an underdog and works as an inspiration to seize your future with your own hands. He was pretty much just a caricature, and the show was more or less carried by the people around him. But without the urgency of a massive tournament, this season had more room to develop him and the rest of the cast. Taking what we already knew and expanding upon it. <br />
<br />
This is where Nomad truly shines greater than its predecessor. It’s not tied down by a destination and has the freedom to explore its cast to the fullest of its runtime. Resulting with the characters having an added sense of realism and complexity to them. While also staying true to how they behaved in the past. But with this freedom comes a paper-thin narrative. Nomad is very much just about exploring the characters as they find their way of life and where they belong. At the start of the show, Joe had lost his former home. Much like a nomad he travels around. Stuck in his past guilt, unable to move forward in his life. Throughout the show there’s a wide usage of the hummingbird as a symbol for guidance. The one who sets Joe on the right path again, a man named Chief, wears this symbol as pride of his nationality. It’s not symbolism at its most subtle. But ties naturally into the story itself and gives meaning to it. <br />
<br />
But only if you had a positive outlook on the first season and especially the characters, will any of this mean anything to you. The lack of an overarching story means that your enjoyment will be largely dependent on your perception of the cast, even more so than in season one. However, even with the looser structure, the identity of Megalo Box is very much still present. <br />
<br />
If the first season&#039;s distinct artstyle and stellar soundtrack was enough to grind your gears then you’ll find that Nomad still has that in spades. Visually pretty much identical to where we left off. The same grit and rawness is still present in the artwork, with good use of lighting and shot composition. Animation is still packing the same punch as what we were given in season one. The fights are bloody and the punches have a strong sense of weight to them. Meanwhile the music is yet again made by mabanua. Giving us beats with an attitude, getting the blood pumping and ready for action. But has a much stronger hispanic influence in its identity this time around. The music also isn’t afraid to leave it’s upbeat focus to congregate with the otherwise pretty dismal tone of this season.<br />
<br />
Nomad was an unneeded follow-up to a show that’s been falling into obscurity. But one that left the series on a higher note that it previously had done. Delivering on more of the series strengths as well as improving on some of its more sour apples. With characters that are more empathizable, and themes one can easily relate to. This installment is definitely an underdog, and it&#039;s a shame this won&#039;t get the amount of attention that it deserves. But thanks to the ones who&#039;ll follow through. The story of Joe is not dead yet.<br />

    Slight spoilers ahead.<br />
<br />
I’m on the record saying I didn’t think Megalo Box needed a sequel and that I don’t think a sequel could even do much. Boy, was I wrong, and i’ve never been happier to be wrong in my entire life. This season of Megalo box is a masterpiece. It takes everything good about season 1: setting, animation, aesthetic, and soundtrack, makes them better, then just makes everything else better while its at it. It improves on the established characters, introduces interesting new ones, and has a more engaging story, all while being thematically brilliant.<br />
<br />
This season improves upon every character, showing the effects of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404967">
        the previous season on them, but also producing new arcs for certain characters that feel incredibly organic, but also personal and emotional. This season is significantly more “noir” in feel then the first season, so much so that the opening looks like it could be attached to something like reservoir dogs, and the characters reflect this. They are selfish and quite often do the wrong thing for their own personal benefit, both emotional and financial. Joe himself is especially standout in this season, which given the level of character writing is very impressive. They take previously established ideas about his character, such as his drive to feel alive within the fight, but also using the ring to move forward in his life, and deconstruct these elements to show how these ideas can negatively impact him and the people around him. The other stand out character for me this season was Chief. Chief is a character we meet early on who helps get both the story and joe’s character arc rolling, while being a thematically brilliant character. His and Joe’s dynamic is one of my favourites of all time.<br />
<br />
Story wise, this season is very different from the first. Whereas the first was a simple underdog story focusing completely on the sport, Megalo boxing takes a major backseat in this season, used only for character progression. It becomes a true character story, with almost a seinen feel to it. Now for some who came for the boxing itself, this may be a drawback, but for me it most definitely wasn’t. A strong focus on the themes and characters within the narrative allowed for far more emotional moments then the first and has seriously endeared me to characters within the story this time round. Without spoiling too much, the story is simply about joe hitting rock bottom and what he wants to do now he’s here and this story helps explore many of the character&#039;s from a completely different angle from before, which helps keep the season feeling incredibly fresh and new, despite being a sequel.<br />
<br />
The visuals of this anime are just amazing. This is a superbly directed anime, with an incredibly unique and engaging visual style that really helps set it apart as something different. While it may not always have the insane sakuga moments of many a shonen out there, that’s not to say they don’t flex their artistic muscles at all, because they do. There is still plenty of moments of brilliant sakuga to be seen, made ever more appealing by the brilliant directing and visual style. One visual motif omnipresent within the season is the hummingbird, which is used to great effect within the anime as a symbol of home and a visualisation of what people are fighting for. Everything from the style, direction, cinematography and visual motifs are great.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack. What to say about the soundtrack. Mabanua is a genius. The soundtrack of season 1 was already brilliant and one of my favourites, but he somehow made it better. With this effort, Mabanua has easily cemented himself as one of my favourite musicians within the industry. On top of that, the voice actors give an amazing performance and everything within the sound production is solid. Genuinely nothing to complain about, and a lot to love.<br />
<br />
And to top it off, it’s also thematically brilliant. It uses the first seasons ending to bring forward these ideas of dreams and how joe has impacted the world but uses the same characters that have been impacted by these dreams joe has shown them to show the importance of its other theme, home. This inner duality is present within all the main characters, but also within a lot of the world building. The show also tackles other themes, such as drug abuse and physical trauma within athletes, immigration and morality issues within the realm of technological progression. Its an incredibly diverse, but compact and tight thematic piece that sticks to these themes above all else.<br />
<br />
I can already tell there will be people who think the ending is anti-climatic, and while I understand why they think this, I think this is the only ending that really makes logical and thematic sense and they definitely didn’t drop the ball on these aspects. As far as this “version” of the ending goes, it definitely did it well. This season got me emotionally many a time throughout all the season and has been an absolute treat to watch every week. This will be my choice for anime of the year.

    **This review is based in the anime 4 episodes in**<br />
<br />
Did I like season 1?: Yes.<br />
<br />
Do I like season 2?: No.<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this?: If you loved season 1 and want to see the series through, sure. If you&#039;re hoping for something as good as season 1, or need something good to watch in your free time, I&#039;d say try looking for something else.<br />
<br />
**Below is my actual review**<br />
<br />
I lowered my expectations prior to watching this because, realistically, how could you top season 1&#039;s introduction? There&#039;s just no way. Regardless, I have been thoroughly disappointed.<br />
<br />
The animation is great. The music is great. It&#039;s not as hyped up

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395406">
        as the first season&#039;s soundtrack, and is more somber with obvious Spanish influence, but regardless it&#039;s pleasing to listen to and serves the scenes and the overall mood of the show really well.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t, however, say many decent things about the story. The beginning of season 1 did a really good job at establishing the characters (who they are; what they want), the setting, and the goal. It also almost immediately sets the stakes, and puts stress on the characters to perform the best they can in what little time they have. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately this kind of stress is missing from season 2. There are stakes. There are consequences. But I never felt that sense of urgency that season 1 had; where they were set to do an impossible task, or face severe consequences. Even with the somber end of one particular episode, that&#039;s all it was--somber. I didn&#039;t feel sad or upset. Which sounds like a silly complaint, but that should be the aim of a story: to move you. Everything so far has felt like a watered down version of what it could be.<br />
<br />
None of this is helped by the blatant political message. I agree with it. I come from a family of immigrants. But having people shouting &quot;these immigrants are taking our jobs!&quot; and &quot;get out of our country!&quot; is just a little too on-the-nose. It feels especially out of place in this anime given the fact that racism was barely an issue in season 1-if at all. It was more so classism, and it did a decent enough job at showing the effects it had on the lesser privileged.<br />
<br />
Id est, Joe and Nanbu were both extremely talented. But, due to their unfortunate circumstances, lived in the middle of nowhere, with no form of identification, fighting fixed fights just to be able to make a little bit of money. When given the chance, no matter how dishonest it was, they were able to fight their way to the top. Undeniable proof that the only thing that was keeping them down were the privileged people at the top. This political message was conveyed way better than the one in season 2. It was subtle, but it showed the consequences in a very realistic and sympathetic way. These three are aspects that season 2 is missing: subtlety, realism (and by extension), sympathy.<br />
<br />
All of this together gives a very bad impression, and we&#039;re only 4 episodes in. I&#039;d talk about certain plotlines that feel a little rushed, but I&#039;m afraid that&#039;d be going too far into spoiler territory.<br />
<br />
Overall I&#039;m anxiously waiting to see if they pull something amazing out of thin air. If not, this will have been a really disappointing follow-up to a story that didn&#039;t really need one.

    Story: 8/10<br />
If you prefer a story-driven or a character-driven anime then this show&#039;s got you covered in both areas so far. The story&#039;s good, it revolves around a rags to riches to rags theme and I like the direction its heading at. <br />
<br />
Art and Sound: 8/10<br />
The art is more or less the same from the first season but the sound is noticeably somber in comparison to the first season&#039;s upbeat genre and it matches well with the story and characters.<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10:<br />
The characters are well-rounded and I&#039;d say that this is where the show&#039;s best at. The little moments where the characters reflect really did the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review394302">
        trick for me.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
I was hooked within the 1st episode.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
A most welcome second second season.

    Nomad takes a very different turn on the happy go lucky feeling of the first season. It&#039;s the perfect sequel to an already perfect series. <br />
<br />
Truly, my only criticism so far is just how dang sad it is. Of course that&#039;s just me. The darker tones of this season are a great juxtaposition to the first season and really emphasises Joe&#039;s own emotional struggles. After all, being the champ megalo boxer can&#039;t be easy for anyone&#039;s mindset.<br />
<br />
As expected, the beautifully crafted sound design of the first season is also present. Great music, very well fitting for the moments and just overall emphasises the enjoyment. <br />
<br />
Joe&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395777">
        character development was unexpected to me but very well done. The time skip between seasons allowed for such rich character development that doesn&#039;t feel rushed or forced.<br />
<br />
This is a great direction for the series to go and I&#039;m looking forward to see how it plays out.

    (TLDR at the bottom, thanks for reading.)<br />
<br />
Nomad has no right to exist, but I am glad it does.<br />
<br />
You can almost consider nomad to be the other side of the meglobox coin, while s1 had a simple underdog story it derived its entertainment from the stellar visuals, soundtrack, and directing whereas nomad is much more focused on its story and characters, and less about the fight.<br />
<br />
Joe starts of this season back at the bottom, while he had achieved everything he set out to do in season 1 it doesn&#039;t make him happy. Nanbu&#039;s gone, Sachio&#039;s gone and while Joe is at the top he is all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405205">
        alone. &quot;They don&#039;t make graves for stray dogs&quot; but in the first episode, we see joe making a grave for a stray dog, combined with the constant imagery between Joe and stray dogs perfectly shows what&#039;s has happened to joe. We know Joe is dead, we only have nomad now.<br />
The first four episodes don&#039;t really concern themselves with the fight but the focus is laid squarely on Joe and the Casa. I mentioned earlier that one of the reasons for Joe&#039;s depression was the depression stemming from his loneliness. Joe and the Casa are complete opposites, you have joe, the successful but lonely and depressed megloboxer and then you have the Casa a persecuted but happy group and opposites attract. Joe slowly grows closer and closer to the Casa until this wondering nomad finally has a home. Mi casa es tu casa.<br />
<br />
And in episode 4 everything the Casa is aiming for is in their reach, they finally have the chance to be able to make the land the life on their home, and all it takes is for Chief to enter the ring once again. Then Chief does it, he secures the land for the Casa and then finally cements Joe as a part of the Casa by calling him, family. When Joe goes to offer Chief a handshake he refuses and hugs him instead, this scene is genuinely heartwarming after only 4 episodes we&#039;ve seen Joe grow and develop as a character while this show builds some great characters of its own.<br />
<br />
But nomad isn&#039;t a 4 episode show and it needs something to hold up its other 9 episodes, the show stubbles between plot points until its final episodes and it drags down the experience, the first four episodes set the bar too high and the rest of the series just can&#039;t reach it.  Episode 5 is a flashback episode, while it does kind of work since Joe is alone again one of the big emotional climax&#039;s of the previous episodes is Joes developing and becoming his old self again and then a sad backstory episode kind of feels that the series is regressing a bit. There is some more back story, some new characters get introduced, some fights happen, this mini-arc about a new character called Mac et cetera et cetera. Nothing that really pushes this show to new heights happens, it certainly has its moments but nothing more than the previous season had. There has been this feeling of melancholy throughout the series, while megalobox was all about the glitz and glamour of boxing nomad is what happens in the aftermath of it all, and the mac mini-arc perfectly encapsulates this.<br />
<br />
Mac, like joe and chief, is a boxer past his prime, He has fought with the gear and his age has come to pass, but because of the new technology offered to him by Sakuma he once more has a shot at the limelight. But all this has done is convinced Mac that he is ok when he clearly isn&#039;t. He keeps trying to achieve glory once again but he ends up pushing away what means the most to him, his family. There is this heartbreaking scene in episode 11 where Mac reaches to his son and he just screams &quot;get away!&quot; and everything from the accompanying ost to the hurt look on Mac&#039;s face these few seconds really sell this mini-arc. For a second nomad is showing that it can live up to its first 4 episodes. The only issue with this mini-arc is while it is great it doesn&#039;t have an emotional connection to Joe, while the Casa arc allowed Joes to grow and change as a character it is much harder to draw that comparison in the Mac arc which limits its potential.<br />
The visuals of this season are the same as the previous season, it still has the low-resolution cel-animated look and while I like the cel-animated look the lower resolution of certain scene can harm anime. But other than that the animation is spot on. The ost is great, nomad has a very Spanish feeling to its ost and to the Casa which helps it carve its own identity, it&#039;s a shame that most of the Spanish influences are mostly contained in the first 4 episodes though.<br />
<br />
TLDR: Nomad manages to be more than just an extra cour of megalobox but if you are only here for the fights to might not be too impressed.<br />

    I was honestly worried the 2nd season won&#039;t stand up to 1st season and I&#039;m so glad I was wrong - It&#039;s been EXCELLENT so far and my favorite show this season.<br />
<br />
Same as season 1 it has that dystopian feel but quite a bit darker. The art-style is as great as it was in season 1 and music is really on point.<br />
<br />
The greatest aspect are the characters, just few episodes in and we already have very memorable personas with their own lives, backstories, problems and reasons to be there. Even though they are just stepping stones for Joe, they really feel like more than that.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review394595">
        hard to rate story from what&#039;s seen so far which is why I&#039;m not giving this season a 10 yet, but so far I&#039;ve high hopes.

    Megalo Box [NOMAD] manages to feel totally different compared to the first season. &quot;Gearless&quot; Joe, begins his new journey, which unlike his initial trajectory where the protagonist was only looking for victory and title, here is presented a more &quot;human&quot; view of Joe himself and his search for redemption to his own past, this is Joe&#039;s fight with himself. One thing I will never understand is why Megalobox is so unknown to the majority of the public, I really hope that in the future this work will reach a larger number of viewers for its potential.<br />
HISTORY: Part 2, has a direct connection with the conclusion

          <span style="display: none;" id="review400185">
        of part 1 and is resumed 7 years in the future after the end of the fight between &quot;Joe vs Yuri&quot; in the Megalonia tournament. The protagonist continues to fight clandestine fights and at the very first moment it is also identified that Nanbu (Joe&#039;s trainer in Part 1) continues to follow him, however, it is realized that it is just a hallucination caused by painkillers and that Nanbu had been. The protagonist carries with him a guilt for the death of his trainer and maybe those visions that Joe was having were nothing more than his own mind bringing remorse and regret, in certain moments of the anime he was suggested that Joe &quot;abandoned&quot; his past his titles and even gave up of the name itself that was its main brand in the first season, but still carries remorse and agony for having ended the past and made its choice. New characters multiply, among them the “Chief”, a fighter of clandestine fights and a resident of a place where immigrants reside, his whole plot is defined, his goal is to win the Megalonia tournament and Joe will help him as a coach.<br />
STAFF: The team is practically the same as in 2018, I can see the special affection of director Moriyama Yo, who acted with firmness in the first season. It is worth mentioning that I was surprised by the announcement of [NOMAD], I really thought that even with the &quot;open&quot; ending the story would end there, but after seeing that the same team would work, all my fears were gone.<br />
SOUNDTRACK: Megalobox is an anime in which I recommend watching with headphones, Mabanua&#039;s work is indescribable because it fits perfectly with the anime (Mabanua who worked on the first season). We had an addition of some special guest appearances like Makoto who wrote the lyrics for the song &quot;El Canto del Colibrí&quot; to the anime&#039;s ED.<br />
· Conclusion: An excellent work presented so far and with great potential, I understand the frustration of some after the conclusion of the first season, but we cannot make the work unfeasible due to the end of its Part 1. Megalobox is in fact a great anime and with great potential, [NOMAD] works something that when I watched it in 2018 I thought I wouldn’t see it.<br />
· Observations: This comment was made until episode 07, so I tried to leave some questions in my analysis mainly of open history. I apologize for possible errors in English, from words to concordances, as English is not my native language.<br />

    This is, in all aspects, an improvement from season 1. The first season started off amazing, but gradually lost a lot of its tone and character in the later episodes once it started to focus more on the fights. Season 2 brings back everything I loved about season 1 in full force and has yet to compromise any of it. The arc with Chief was heartfelt and brought social issues to light while keeping them mixed into the reality of the world. When other shows highlight a social issue like this, it usually seems like an afterthought, ripped directly from our present world and shoehorned

        into whatever world the show is in. This was not at all the case here and I think it significantly enhanced the story and characters. The animation is, unsurprisingly, in a gritty uncommon style and absolutely stellar. The music in this season is also top tier, especially the ending theme. In conclusion, this is the best anime I&#039;ve seen in years.

    This show has been an emotional ride for me. We started with Joe&#039;s struggle as he battling his inner demon due to &quot;certain&quot; circumstances. From there, we see Joe&#039;s journey in his attempt to find his back home.  And honestly, I love the ending. I agree that the fight scene is quite short but then this entire season 2 is not about Megalo Box. It&#039;s about the journey of the 2 boxers (Joe and Mac) that has lost in their life. The entire season shows the pain and the loss that these 2 boxers had and throughout the entire series, we have been fed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404942">
        with the hummingbird story. So yeah, the fight is rather anticlimatic but I&#039;m glad that these 2 scarred guys have found their way back home. Because, at the end of the day, home sweet home.

      I was hesitant to watch when I initially heard Megalo Box was getting a second season as I was extremely pleased with the ending of the first season. So as anyone else I wasn&#039;t looking forward to have such a good shonen dragged through the mud by giving it a second season when there wasn&#039;t really much to work off of. However to my surprise they did not continue going with the shonen genre of the first season and went with a drama with a cold start to the season to an already broken and lost Joe. <br />
  The plot of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404934">
        second season is extremely good although it feels like an extra episode or two could&#039;ve fleshed it out a little bit more, and is a great extension of the first season. I would highly NOT recommend this if you&#039;re looking for the boxing matches of the first season as you will be disappointed. Other than that I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys the art style of the show and/or likes complex character development.

    First of all,I want to say that the first season 1 of the series was kinda boring.I almost lost hope if the season 2 of the sequel would be worthwhile or not but I just dont understand that how i fell in love with this outstanding series.To be honest,i almost hopelessly started this one after finishing the season 1 with boredom but the season 2 actually is awesome.The animation is same as season 1 but the story plot just got an outstanding improvement.I almost fell into tears after finishing 10-11 episodes after knowing what happened with Zoe and Sachio.Most of all,the soundtracks on each scenes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402161">
        were just way too perfectly synchornized that I got goosebumps in every second of each episode.<br />
<br />
Needless to say,the story plot for season 2 was well organized than season 1.so i just want to say one thing that if you get bored with season 1 and dont want to watch season 2 then don&#039;t do that.Either way,at least watch season 2 cause if you don&#039;t watch then you are going to miss the actual fun of a boxing anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
After all,the main twist actually started in season 2.It almost feels like that the season 1 was just the starting of the anime like saying &#039;I am just showing the anime starting point right now.the twist will come into light later&#039;.<br />
<br />
Finally,I can say that the anime deserves praise for its story plot throughly.I will highly recommend Megalobox Season 2 to watch.I guarantee that your time will be worthwhile

    Seeing people give season 2 some love really makes me happy. This show is so underrated, it&#039;s not even funny.<br />
<br />
Boxing itself is not really entertaining anymore. MMA and other sports are just so much more engaging (at least to me) and don&#039;t feel like a massive cash grab. BUT I digress, there is a reason why THIS boxing show IS very entertaining. Actually, there are quite a few. <br />
<br />
If you are here reading reviews to see if you want to watch season two since you finished season one, do yourself a favor and watch it. Here is your closure. Here is your extended character development.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402160">
        The same great art, and storytelling is here. <br />
<br />
You literally have zero reason to skip out on this show unless you didn&#039;t enjoy the first season. What kind of person rates a show poorly, or doesn&#039;t finish a previous season of a show and then watches the next season of a show? Probably someone who puts milk in a bowl before their cereal.

    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
This is a decent sequel. Nothing more, nothing less to say about it.<br />
Although, at times I wonder why is this made at the first place. I just can&#039;t shake off the feeling that this sequel is just a way to milk off this franchise. Wow, that&#039;s kinda dumb thing to say by a Fate fan who keeps consuming countless of Fate anime being released lmao.<br />
But even though I feel that way, I don&#039;t hate this sequel because of how it opened up a different perspective from the 1st season.<br />
<br />
The story starts with our drug-addict mc. Joe hits his lowest after his coach

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404940">
        died. Pair that up with the team breaking apart and you&#039;d get a not-so-happy start for a sequel. Like I said, it&#039;s not bad because of how it offered a different tone to the series. It&#039;s more akin to a &quot;what-if&quot; scenario. There&#039;s really nothing to say here except the fact that this season was pretty rush. <br />
It introduced a lot of themes and sh*ts that it failed to met those said themes with a satisfying conclusion and was mostly forgotten for the latter half of the series.<br />
It&#039;s a shame though because of how this boxing anime could&#039;ve distance itself from boxing. But no, it&#039;s a boxing anime so it should have the epic final boxing fight in the last episode. Well, lemme spoil you a bit... that fight was pretty meh.<br />
First of all, that fight doesn&#039;t have any build-up what so ever. What makes the first season&#039;s final fight so good is because how the beginning of the story build-ups to it. But here, because of the fact that it introduced a lot of stuff that gets forgotten later on, the final fight didn&#039;t get much highlight because of how rush and undeveloped it is.<br />
<br />
The characters too. I wasn&#039;t really that interested in Joe in the first place. In the first season, I already didn&#039;t care about him, but his fights about being gearless was interesting. So if you took off the niche about him being gearless, then yeah, I wouldn&#039;t really get interested to him anymore. Part of the reason why I never got interested about the final fight in this season.<br />
Other than him, the side characters are also pretty uninteresting and underdeveloped. Mainly because their screen time was cut short and that&#039;s a shame tbh.<br />
<br />
The animation is pretty good. I&#039;m not really a fan of how everything looks here, but everything was done pretty good imo. It was consistent and the punches have some weight behind to it. It&#039;s pretty good.<br />
<br />
The music however wasn&#039;t my cup of tea. The opening was pretty meh, and the ending song wasn&#039;t into my taste. The ost was decent though.<br />
<br />
Overall, like I said, a decent sequel.<br />
(4.4/10)

    The first season of Megalo Box was good. Not a masterpiece of course, but surely an enjoyable anime (FIY:it was a tribute to Ashita no Joe) with great sound effects. But i really gotta say it, this second season is A LOT better.<br />
&quot;Nomad&quot; takes an unexpected turn, showing Joe&#039;s fall from grace. <br />
The feeling I had since the first episode was like I was watching a movie. <br />
The fights animation are better than season 1 (but you don&#039;t get hooked to the anime for the fights, trust me). <br />
Great character development (an element which the season 1 lacked), a beautiful OST, even better than first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401293">
        season, and a heart-touching story. <br />
In my humble opinion, one of the best shows of the year.

    Nomad takes Megalo Box to the next level of character development. Without betraying the core values that makes Megalo Box great (unique are style, great sound track, fighting). The upbeat tone of season one is totally subverted with sadness and struggle to become whole after letting drugs and loss take what was left of Joe.<br />
Season one was about youth and triumph, and not giving up no matter how tough the fight is, but in season 2 its a new era for joe. In season 2 you get to see Joe struggle to build himself from nothing and I cant wait to see what this masterpiece

          <span style="display: none;" id="review394591">
        has to give by the end of the season.<br />
For a anime where things were left off with a nice conclusion, this is a great addition to the universe of Joe.

    We&#039;ve truly witnessed the conclusion of a Masterpiece guys.<br />
For those who think this is a trash ending or didn&#039;t like the ending mainly because Joe didn&#039;t win the Match or hated that it brought to a stop by Sachio<br />
well, I think it will help if you look at this anime from a different viewpoint.<br />
Firstly it&#039;s not your general sports anime where everything is focused on the sport, everything does to some point revolve around Boxing but the story is more like Ping Pong the Animation it focuses more on Life and the Act of Living and different stages/changes in Life. General sports animes can be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405181">
        very touching &amp; deep too especially Haikyuu &amp; Hajime No Ippo they are all Masterpiece and I just love sports anime but here the focus is not Boxing instead Boxing is just a Medium for Struggle, Fighting &amp; earning their place in Life.<br />
Joe, Mac &amp; Chief lost their ways and wandered aimlessly but with the guidance of the Hummingbirds, they reached their Home. Boxing was always with them but this was a journey for them to reach their Home.<br />
and if you think in this match they neglected boxing that&#039;s totally not true at all<br />
Mac was determined to win the match with his own powers &amp; abilities, not with the help of BES because that would be like cheating same as using a drug to beef up your power also with BES he was losing his mind, and his family HIS HOME. So in this match against Joe whom he admired greatly like an Idol and always dreamed to have a match with him, he fought being Himself  &amp; won with his own power that he himself cultivated.<br />
And for Joe, he was already weakened by the side-effects of using Drug so if he had continued he could have died and so wouldn&#039;t be able to return to his home To Team Nowhere.<br />
As Arnold Schwarzenegger said when he retired that he just stops competing but he would continue Bodybuilding till death.<br />
The same goes for Joe he can now serve Boxing for all his remaining life and train many youths in boxing at Gym Nowhere which Mr.Nanbu &amp; others of Team Nowhere created and now has become their HOME.<br />
Joe, Mac &amp; Chief all lost their ways &amp; wandered for a long long time but in the end, all of them fought as Real Boxers and Returned HOME.
