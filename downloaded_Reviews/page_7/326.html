Owing in large part to the incredible soundtrack and fresh character designs and art direction, the tone of the movie shifts entirely, transitioning from an inspirational story of motivation and hard work into a deeply somber and introspective world.<br />
<br />
The story itself is very simple, examining the relationship of Nozomi and Mizore in their final year in high school. It openly compares the feelings of the two characters with the piece they play, the namesake of the film, and the folktale it was based on. I was originally concerned that the comparison would end up overplayed and come off as forced, but I left pleasantly surprised. The film acknowledges the simplicity and straight-forwardness of the story, but instead of allowing itself to be confined to that, it achieves a level of technical mastery that managed to blow me away, even though I was already plenty used to the historically superb Kyoto Animation and the other wonderful works by director Naoko Yamada before watching it.<br />
<br />
The film succeeds on such a level because it allows itself to be a single vignette in the &quot;Hibike&quot; storyline. It&#039;s not a story of hard work, a story of competition, or even a story of music. It&#039;s a simple story of two characters, and it&#039;s precisely because this aspect of it was so intimately understood by the production crew at KyoAni that such a story was allowed to flourish. There is no excess. The film brazenly jumps through time, refusing to linger on anything unnecessary while still allowing the events that clearly happen off-screen to create meaningful depth in the story. We don&#039;t focus on what practicing is like. We don&#039;t see what the characters do on their weekends. We don&#039;t listen to the girls ruminating on their feelings in the comfort of their beds. From the moment we as an audience walk with Mizore onto campus at the beginning to when we exit it at the end, all we see is what&#039;s limited to the confines of the school, to the band room and to our two leads, and everything else is left to become a sort of wistful ether that exists on the fringes of our minds. Because what was shown was clearly so carefully chosen, we come to viscerally understand the weight behind every lingering shot. It&#039;s an incredibly delicate experience, and one that could&#039;ve only been realized with production quality of this caliber.<br />
<br />
Yamada&#039;s quirks as a director have often been the subject of conversation in the anime community, but I believe that this film has been one of the best applications of those idiosyncrasies to date. Her approach to the art of unspoken communication paralleled the film&#039;s focus on Mizore, a girl unable to truly express, and at moments even understand, her own feelings. Subtle gestures such as Mizore stroking her hair not only serve to silently convey the cast&#039;s thoughts, but end up feeling as if they were sewn into the very plot itself due to how integral of a role they play. The consistent focus on the characters&#039; legs—a mainstay in Yamada&#039;s works—mirrors Mizore&#039;s own downcast eyes, and the other camera shots always seem to look off to the side, as if shyly avoiding the characters around her. Add to this the introduction of a softer pastel art style, and we see the world brilliantly through the lens of our main characters, creating something amazingly intimate.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack and sound direction are, hands down, the shining star of the film. It combines composer Kensuke Ushio&#039;s fragmented, minimal approach also found on his work in Yamada&#039;s previous film, &quot;Koe no Katachi,&quot; with the expertly realized orchestral arrangements that the series is known for. However, gone are the sweeping brass-heavy pieces that complimented Kumiko&#039;s role as a main character in the original series. The introduction of the new piece instead turns the focus to the woodwinds. Brass now supports from the background, and the airy voices of woodwind instruments paint the entirety of the film with a wonderful warmth that sets it apart from the main franchise. The parallel stories of Mizore and Nozomi and the girls from the folktale blend masterfully into each other because of this—from the gorgeous bass clarinet adding a sense of comforting security to the cold isolation of a &quot;Koe no Katachi&quot;-styled piano piece casting an ominous tone over the characters—yet the well-timed use of other instruments such as the bassoon add the perfect amount of levity when necessary (the bassoon in particular being used wonderfully to comedic effect when the bassoonists themselves are relevant to the scene), while still staying in line with the overarching thematic style.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s why this film works. Every aspect of it is fine-tuned to near-uncanny perfection. The psyches of each character are silently brought to the surface through each deliberate animation choice, from Nozomi&#039;s eyes darting around the room to Mizore&#039;s subconscious trembling. The soundtrack compliments each and every emotional swell—synchronized musical flourishes match footsteps and impeccably timed silences pull us devastatingly close to the most minute of actions. Each background track cuts to the core, yet never accidentally overpowers the gentle art and soft color scheme. Because of this masterful balance, all of the reactions are almost unnaturally natural, seemingly larger than life because of how lifelike they are. This kind of exaggerated humanity is an achievement only possible through the medium of animation, and even then, I have never seen it done quite like this. Although giving a full score seems like it could be a provocative statement for a film focused simply on the minutia of a measly two characters, if this movie isn&#039;t considered among the best for the sheer level of craftsmanship that it exhibits, then I really don&#039;t know what other film deserves to be.

    Liz and the Blue Bird is 30 minutes longer than it needs to be. Despite the smooth animation, crisp visual style and well written comfy soundtrack, this movie is a drag to watch. <br />
<br />
The story is unfortunately basic. Two friends are playing important parts in a concert band piece and relate themselves to the story behind the piece. They have a very gay scene at the end where they hug and say what they love about each other. In the end, they become closer friends because they understand each other more. There is not enough content to stretch the movie out to 90 minutes with.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295426">
        The first scene is seven and a half minutes and literally nothing happens.<br />
<br />
The movie takes place in two locations. The first is the school, which consists of a couple generic highschool rooms. The second is the world of the music piece, which uses a different art style to differentiate it from the real world. When the movie is in the real world, the style looks like that of A Silent Voice. When it&#039;s in the music piece, it looks somewhat like a picture book and uses the style of Baja&#039;s Studio. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack is the most important part of the movie. The titular piece, Liz and the Blue Bird, was made specifically for the movie. We don&#039;t hear much of it, just the 3rd movement. The piece was made to reflect the contrasting personalities of the two main characters. The rest of the soundtrack is relaxing and subdued pieces that are intended to evoke a dreamlike feeling, and succeed in doing so. <br />
<br />
The story was not one worth telling. While it&#039;s an improvement upon Hibike Euphonium Season 2&#039;s arc revolving around the two leads, spending 90 minutes watching two girls walk around some halls, talk to each other and play instruments is not engaging. The visuals of A Silent Voice were more consistent and more impressive due to the many different locations and plot events that allowed for lots of animation. The style of Baja&#039;s studio is too cutesy and childish, but it isn&#039;t used enough to be a large problem. The soundtrack is the major reason to watch the movie. It wouldn&#039;t have as much significance if you listened to it by itself since it needs the context of the movie. Even so, Liz and the Blue Bird is too boring to be worth your time.<br />
<br />
Should you really watch Liz and the Blue Bird?<br />
No. It&#039;s boring.

    From the world&#039;s most famous female anime director, Yamada Naoko, comes Liz and the Blue Bird. A spinoff movie of Hibike Euphonium, produced under KyoAni. <br />
<br />
<br />
The movie focuses on two Hibike side characters, Mizore and Nozomi. The story is about their relationship and personal drama, mainly focusing around the ever present music and how it plays a part in their coming-of-age and self-discovery, giving a meaning to their life and the base to their relationship. The movie especially focuses on how hard letting go off something is, and raises the question &quot;are all good things really bound to end?&quot; This is presented in 3 different

          <span style="display: none;" id="review278731">
        ways. Directly in daily life, inderectly and silently through audiovisual story-telling which is mainly seen via character behavior and expressions, and the third way being the symbolism of Liz/aoi tori. <br />
<br />
<br />
The music presented is way more impactful -for myself at least- than in the actual Tv series. The art an animation is typical KyoAni for the expectation of the actual monogatari side of the story which is so fluid and gentle it looks almost fragile. Surprisingly beautiful for KyoAni who practically never tries anything new to secure mainstream appeal. Kudos for that. <br />
<br />
<br />
Basically, this is highly similar to other KyoAni movies. In a way, it&#039;s like Tamako Love Story with different approach, but also like Koe no Katachi except this time the other lead characters is not a mary sue. For those who enjoyed these movies for their drama, and found beauty within them, Liz and the Blue Bird is more than recommendable.

    It&#039;s nearly impossible for someone interested in the anime industry not to have heard of Yamada Naoko. Her personality-focused direction on K-On! is arguably what turned it into a hit and raised it above its contemporaries. More recently, she directed Koe no Katachi, a film that seemed to signal a move into a more art-house style with unusual shot compositions, a minimal soundtrack and a meandering pace. While the film had many flaws, its personal message resonated with a lot of people, further shining a light on Yamada&#039;s talent.<br />
With this in mind, it was clear that Liz to Aoi Tori would be well received, even

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295351">
        from the conceptual level - a down-to-earth, character-driven drama tied to an existing franchise, directed by the person who does that best, with a heaping helping of symbolism. However, in my opinion, the final product can be described as nothing other than a waste of talent.<br />
<br />
First of all, the visuals. If KyoAni is known for anything, it&#039;s their high quality artwork and animation. However, in this case they&#039;re oddly mediocre while acting more flashy than ever. Characters have their hair flap around wildly to show off fluid key animation that everyone knew they were capable of anyway and doesn&#039;t add anything to the scene other than a distraction, while the background art consists of uncharacteristically low detail surfaces which seem to have been made completely separate from the foreground objects (and not in a superflat way, there was clearly an effort to portray depth within the frame). The transitions don&#039;t guide the viewer&#039;s eyes so much as throw them all over the screen, and there&#039;s a lot of random cutaways to objects lying around the room or to the side of a character&#039;s limb without any real purpose or meaning, not to mention it rarely goes more than two cuts without an obnoxious depth-of-field effect that puts winter&#039;s Violet Evergarden to shame.<br />
<br />
The plot moves at the slowest of paces, and while that isn&#039;t a problem in and of itself, it makes the narrative progress (which is almost exclusively located in the last 20-30 minutes) feel jarring and unearned when it comes. There&#039;s a heavy focus on a story which our two main characters are obsessed with and constantly relate themselves to, even though thematically it turns out that the story doesn&#039;t fit either of their situations very well, making it feel like wasted time which is especially egregious when coupled with the aforementioned pacing.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the sound design is pretty exceptional (it was directed by Youta Tsuruoka and Kensuke Ushio after all), and I have no complaints regarding it. It really helped sell the reaction to Mizore&#039;s performance around the climax and the evocative dreamlike melodies may have been what kept me from completely disliking the film.<br />
<br />
All in all, I don&#039;t regret watching it but I can&#039;t see myself rewatching it or recommending it to anyone. 5/10

    I&#039;m going to keep this short and simple. <br />
<br />
I surprisingly really enjoyed this movie. Yeah I guess you could say its a little bit slow at some parts, but for me that didn&#039;t take away from this film. I cant really tell you what exactly I enjoyed about this film, the characters, storyline, the art style, everything just fit in perfectly. It really didn&#039;t feel like an hour and 30 minutes, I pretty much flew past this film in no time, and I understood the story. It was just very enjoyable for me to watch and that&#039;s why I&#039;m giving it a 10 star rating.

    A Genuine Masterpiece of Yuri; Or How Shoujo Become Adult<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
After international success of &quot;Koe no Katachi&quot; (or, &quot;A Silent Voice,&quot;) Naoko Yamada has been regarded as one of leading anime directors. In &quot;Koe no Katachi,&quot; Yamada tried to adopt the adolescent&#039;s sense of guilt as a main subject and depict how the young overcomes their difficult time of teenage, which was highly reputed both by the folk and by the critics.<br />
<br />
As the former work shows, Naoko Yamada tends to depict teenagers&#039; mental conflict, sour-sweet love, and attitudes towards coming future, especially girls. This is true also in the latest featured anime, &quot;Liz to Aoi Tori.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Liz

          <span style="display: none;" id="review278704">
        to Aoi Tori&quot; is a kind of spin-off of Kyoto Animation&#039;s &quot;Hibike! Euphonium&quot; series. However, though all of characters on the screen are from the TV series, there is no need of watching it before you go to cinemas. Yamada created this movie as a completely independent work.<br />
<br />
The protagonist is Mizore, a high-school student and good at playing the oboe. Though she is spending her last year of the school, she have not decided what she will do after graduation. What she always thinks of is Nozomi, her cheerful friend, and, a member of the school band like Mizore is.<br />
<br />
For Mizore and Nozomi&#039;s final chance of winning the national competition, a coach selects an instrumental composition, &#039;Liz to Aoi Tori,&#039; which is based on a (fictitious) fairy tale. As the best players of oboe and flute in the club, they starts to practice hard, but it seems that something between them becomes an obstacle to brush up the music, and after realizing that fact the two meet each other in a biology room.<br />
<br />
In this work, both Mizore and Nozomi&#039;s emotions and standpoints are likened to the characters of the fairy tale, Liz, a lonely girl, and the blue bird, which transforms itself to a girl and starts to live with Liz to heal Liz&#039;s sadness. In the end of the tale, the blue bird leaves Liz&#039;s house, following Liz&#039;s advice. The director, Naoko Yamada, carefully treated this tale and accomplished to make it the framework of the entire anime.<br />
<br />
At first, we might consider that Mizore is compared to Liz, for she does not have many friends and tend to bare loneliness. In contrast, Nozomi&#039;s gregarious trait easily connects to the cheerful blue bird, which is believed to bring happiness, in our brains.<br />
<br />
This assumption leads us to one certain understanding: this movie may be about Yuri or even girls&#039; love between Mizore and Nozomi. True, for Mizore Nozomi is her only friend. Mizore always stands just behind Nozomi and follows her. Such acts reminds us of many Yuri anime/manga.<br />
<br />
However, &quot;Liz to Aoi Tori&quot; is not merely a Yuri anime; it depicts how shoujo leave their teenage-like traits, as the blue birds leaves the cage. We cannot deny that &quot;Liz to Aoi Tori&quot; is a masterpiece of the Yuri culture, but this work goes beyond this reputation.<br />
<br />
Throughout the story, Yamada rarely depicts landscapes or incidents outside the school. For teenagers, it is school that isolates them from the society; school is the cage. As long as they remain in school, they can be shoujo and avoid from being adult. However, shoujo cannot be shoujo forever, because of request from the world, and of their growing. Someday shoujo will have to fly from the nest. Yamada has already realized it and includes this school - cage metaphor in &quot;Liz to Aoi Tori&quot; to express growing of Mizore and Nozomi after going through their conflicts.<br />
<br />
As above, Yamada&#039;s ambition easily goes beyond our expectation. What is impressive here is that Kyoto Animation and staffs of &quot;Liz to Aoi Tori&quot; met Yamada&#039;s, and our anticipation with highly-refined techniques and unusual talents. Animators succeeded to live up to Yamada&#039;s fine direction plans, from where eyes focus to tiny actions of Mizore, which reflects transition of her emotions. Drawings of the fairy tale is also worth mentioning; you might feel as if you were reading an animated picture book.<br />
<br />
Music and sound effects are memorable, too. Kensuke Ushio, a composer, again made an unique soundtrack mainly based on notes of piano. Like &quot;Koe no Katachi,&quot; Yamada and Ushio used classical piano tunes effectively, which tells us the changes of characters&#039; mind, their maturity and immaturity, and their growing. Sound effects helps such direction using music, so I strongly recommend you to see this work in theater.<br />
<br />
With these sophisticated elements, Yamada tried to tell us something important. Back to the theme of this work, the director concisely showed how shoujo open a door to the world, that is, how shoujo leave their young days. As is often the case with Yamada&#039;s featured anime, words appeared in her movie are keys. At the beginning of the movie, we see an impressive word: &#039;disjoint.&#039; Then, Yamada gives us another clue at the end of this work; again she indicates the word &#039;disjoint&#039; and then she erases a prefix &#039;dis-.&#039; Paradoxically, by disjointing we can joint; or, by jointing we can disjoint. It will not mean that in order to disjoint we have to joint something in advance; it just implies that jointing and disjointing are supporting each other. Shoujo can be mature women by jointing ties to someone and by disjointing it.<br />
<br />
After all, Mizore and Nozomi decided to help each other, though a tragedy has set on. It is that way that they will take to grow up, which indicates us what &#039;joint&#039; and &#039;disjoint&#039; mean. Both Mizore and Nozomi are Liz, though the two are also the blue bird. Supporting each other, shoujo will fly to another sky. Naoko Yamada achieved to express it finely. Definitely one of the best anime in 2018.

    Overall rating: 10/10<br />
<br />
I enjoyed this film more than the entirety of Hibike! Euphonium, and fully recommend to give it a chance. <br />
<br />
It is a beautiful and emotional piece of art.<br />
<br />
All elements of the film -- the story, art and sound direction come together beautifully like orchestra music. Nothing in the film is executed at random.<br />
<br />
Story and characters: 9/10<br />
<br />
The story is simple and fully contained in the film, although I&#039;d highly recommend to have watched Hibike! Euphonium before giving this film your attention. It adds much to the backstory of the relationship between the main characters, which is the core of the film.<br />
<br />
That said, the film

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376585">
        should be viewed differently than the anime series, as the overall tone is different (Hibike! has for the most part a casual, fun feel to it, while Liz and the Blue Bird has a more somber, mature feel). <br />
<br />
Art and sound: 10/10<br />
<br />
The art direction is similar to the series and beautifully executed. There isn&#039;t a single scene wasted. The soundtrack matches the scenes and emotion perfectly.<br />
<br />
- - - <br />
I highly recommend to give Liz and the Blue Bird a chance if you&#039;ve already watched Hibike! Euphonium.

    It has been a while since I was awestruck by a movie, and I&#039;m glad that Liz and the Blue Bird provided me the chance to watch such a beautifully made film.<br />
<br />
At the beginning of the film, we are introduced to two people, Midore and Nozomi, who are polar opposites yet quite similar. I was confident that the two of them would portray Liz and the Blue Bird, the musical work for which they are both preparing for a competition. However, the beauty of this film lies in the subtleness that subdues itself into the factors that lead to us realizing that Midore and Nozomi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415703">
        are both Liz and the Blue Bird.Liz, because they are lonely and, in some ways, fearful of being abandoned. And the Blue Bird, because they realize that no matter how painful the thought is of being left behind, what is important is to move forward.<br />
<br />
Throughout the film, I was certain with the fact that Midore (Liz) and Nozomi (the Blue Bird) will only ever encapsulate the personality of the characters they &#039;play&#039; as in the musical piece they will solo for. However, this was only a shallow perspective of it; this whole time, throughout the first half of the movie, they were both Liz. Both of them were afraid of being left behind by one another. And by the end of film, they both morph beautifully into the Blue Bird, having full confidence, and though bittersweet of the thought of &#039;leaving&#039;, is still keen towards moving forward.<br />
<br />
The music that was used in the film was notable, although this was a given considering how the series this film is part of is a band that plays classical pieces. And as someone who is a fan of classical music, I was met with the feeling of familiarity; the emotions that surged through me while listening to the painfully beautiful piece that Midore and Nozomi soloed for  tugged at my heart strings. Not only did you feel emotion from the dialogue of the film, but also the words that etched itself in the music they have played. Although not much dialogue was shared between them regarding what they felt about and towards each other (at least, not until the end of the film), the viewers were already provided with the opportunity to understand the feelings they were trying to convey for each other and for themselves.<br />
<br />
Although the film focuses on the relationship of Midore and Nozomi, I was very happy to see that it didn&#039;t entirely focus on that factor; they also focused on their individual growth, perfectly embodying the story of Liz and the Blue Bird.<br />
<br />
As always, KyoAni graces us with another masterpiece. The only thing that saddens me about this whole movie would be the fact that we did not witness the competition they will take part in. Nevertheless, Liz and the Blue Bird will leave you with a feeling of contentment and the understanding of the importance of moving forward.<br />

    There are movies that you know are great on first viewing.<br />
<br />
But then there are movies that hit you so hard that you cannot wait to watch it again.<br />
<br />
Liz and the Blue Bird was that movie for me. It only took a single viewing for me to know that this is easily my favorite movie. This movie is so powerful that a single word appearing on the screen at the beginning and end makes me want to bawl my eyes out. The character animation in particular also stands out to me. I&#039;ve never seen any other piece of animation that handles facial expressions as well as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411145">
        this one.<br />
<br />
The score titled Girls, Dance, Staircase is also of note here. It was recorded in the very school that the fictional Kitauji High School is based on, and it really shows. Each footstep taken is planned out as part of the music, almost making it seem like a dance of sorts. This is best exemplified in the 8 minute near-silent intro of the two girls just walking to their classroom.<br />
<br />
The pacing is broken up by the fairy tale of Liz and the Blue Bird as Mizore reads the story over the course of the film. These segments are reminiscent of watercolor paintings and it helps to change up the setting every now and then, as the rest of the movie takes place entirely within the high school. The choice to cast the same voice actress as Liz as well as the Blue Bird (in both the sub and the dub) is an interesting one, and I think it helps add to the more whimsical feeling these segments have.<br />
<br />
Naoko Yamada has very quickly become my favorite director, but only one of her films is separate from other series. A Silent Voice is the one most people know, but it is actually my least favorite of hers. If you enjoyed that, I implore you to give Liz and the Blue Bird a try. It can be viewed without watching the show it is tied to as the two leads are only side characters in the show.<br />

    Liz to Aoi Tori,<br />
<br />
First off, to those not familiar with the series Hibiki Euphorium, the movie can be viewed standalone without any knowledge of the said series, however, knowing the series and the various character in it brings an extra depth and enjoyment when viewing the movie.<br />
<br />
The movie deals with the simple yet close relationship between two side characters in the main series and the storybook tale of the affrementioned title of the movie. Mizore is a quiet and shy character who we see in her seemingly daily routine of quietly coming to school early and wait on it&#039;s steps for her only friend Nozomi,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280036">
        a lively and chipper girl. The way they don&#039;t need to talk much to acknowlede the other tells us this is their usual way. Mizore plays the oboe, Nozomi plays the flute, both of them plays an important solo on the school&#039;s band.<br />
<br />
Nozomi brought along a book that interest Mizore. The book is &quot;Liz and the blue&quot;. As Mizore reads the story, she finds herself symphathizing to the lovely but very lonely Liz in the book, especially when Liz grew fond of a pretty blue that suddenly came by.<br />
<br />
The movie&#039;s main theme about love and about growing up and about the things one must give up especially to those we truly love rings true on how both Mizore and Nozomi interpret the said fairy tail. Both girls are going into their third year and last year of high-school, they&#039;ve been together for a long time as seen in the flashbacks. Nozomi is the cheerful and popular one, with lots of friends. Mizore, whose very talented in playing the oboe is rather the introvert, wouldnt even bother to help her junior in the club to play their instrument without much prodding. We get to know more of the two with film&#039;s leasurely pace and unusually bright but flat artwork while juxtaposing it to Liz&#039;s colorful sorta Ghibli-esque watercolor wash. Both of the girls had their peaceful day on the sun, but sadly everything must come to an end like all good fairytale. A precious time in their life&#039;s chapter must come to bittersweet conclusion in order to move on to next chapter in their lives, sadly like the blue bird, each have a different path they must fly too. To have the strenght to let go of the other is probably hardest thing one can do. There lies the drama of Liz and the blue bird.<br />
<br />
The film&#039;s quite different in look and tone of the main series. I for one like the more angular flat design of the film. It presents the characters in a more direct, less enhanced look. There&#039;s still the usual quirks by Kyoani and director Yamada in the film like the constant use of rack-focus on the characters close-up face, the quirky running that the girls do... Though I don&#039;t see thue usual cutting the characters mouth kind of framing that they used to do.<br />
<br />
The film is quite engaging. Some people might get bored at the film&#039;s slow pacing and a rather uneventful drama, but the leasurely pace let me breath in more the films atmosphere and setting, it get&#039;s me more to emphathize with the movie&#039;s two protagonist, as well as showing the series main charcters in a new light.<br />
<br />
Once again this film is one of those you either love it or hate it. The points that one considers weakness in the story or plot are also considered it&#039;s strenght to some. It&#039;s quite hard to point a finger into it&#039;s construction without exposing one&#039;s bias to either one.<br />

    One week before this film would hit US theaters, I was just learning about it. I saw some artwork from the film and thought, “Huh a music anime film. Oh it is a Hibike side-story. Sounds interesting.” Three days before I’m set to get see the film, videos on YouTube start popping up for the film. One by Lock-kun and the other by Mother’s Basement. Both videos praise the film on all accounts with Lock-kun going as far to say it’s the greatest thing they’ve ever seen. Ok well now the bar is set wayyyyyyyyyyyyy high for this film. I arrive at the theater, sit

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293738">
        down, and prepare myself to (hopefully) enjoy one and a half hours of this Hibike side story. <br />
<br />
I was going to include this one pre-written section to talk about my feelings about the Hibike TV show. However, it isn&#039;t needed because it doesn&#039;t matter due to what the film ends up showing. You can go into this film 100% ready without seeing the show. Yes it helps connect some dots but honestly the film does such an amazing job relaying the character troubles and interactions. You just understand each character&#039;s standing within the cast.<br />
<br />
The film is, quite simply, the best animated drama film I&#039;ve seen thus far. Going into the film I wanted to find every little issue with it due to the hype that Lock-kun and Mother&#039;s Basement started perpetuating leading up to its US release. They were though...completely correct. This film is marvelous. <br />
<br />
The music and visuals have to be talked about together because, like with the TV show, they are married together. In the film, every scene is perfectly intertwined with visual and acoustic representation. The music dances with the animation all the way through the film; one does not lead the other. The drama (to be more precise melodrama) works because of this marriage. If one of them were over-the-top, I wouldn&#039;t be able to take the film seriously. Luckily the film pulls off this balancing act throughout the entire film.<br />
<br />
The film tells a dual but interlinked story; one being a following of two members of the high school&#039;s concert band and the other being a glance of a townsperson meeting a new friend. The stuff that revolves around the school looks great. It is staple Hibike detail. The stuff that revolves around this picturebook-like story though is amazing. It almost comes off as a Miyazaki-esque looking film which is a huge compliment. The fact that the studio was able to juggle between these two drastically different art styles within the same film is praise worthy. The music performance scenes are also quite the treat for the eyes. One of the scenes in particular takes over 5 minutes to complete and there are no sort of cuts that force you away from the performance. So you are seeing 5 minutes of straight up musical playing animation. It&#039;s amazing, all of it.<br />
<br />
The music made me cry alright. I haven&#039;t cried in a film since I don&#039;t know when. The music, working in tandem with the visuals, will pull on your heart strings if you are invested in the characters. From an atheistic standpoint, I loved the music. It fit the setting of the concert band really well and the music was super pleasing to listen to.<br />
<br />
The two main characters in the film worked really well for me. They are great friends but they fundamentally misunderstand each other. The idea of having them work together on a duet solo for a song fits perfectly into their final characterization. I was sort of invested in them in the beginning but by the end I was 100% on-board.<br />
<br />
As a side note, I thought I would be disappointed with the main cast of the TV show being sidelined but honestly it was for the best. I applaud the studio for sticking to making this film its own thing rather than fanservice in the other characters. The film also completely skipped a pool event. The film is 100% ready to show you a serious film. <br />
<br />
My one gripe with the film is that it made the decision to skip over early characterization of the two main characters. You are dropped into the story pretty much at the tail end of their high school life. Since we don&#039;t see their freshmen and other earlier years together, I had issues early on getting invested into the characters. However, this is honestly a pretty small gripe in the grand scheme of things. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know what else to really say about this film. The octopus hair wasn&#039;t octopusy enough? I left stunned with how much I enjoyed it and even now writing this review I&#039;m still stunned. I don&#039;t know when/if I&#039;ll watch it again in my life but I&#039;m glad that I got to see it when I did in the theater. You don&#039;t have to have seen the TV show to watch this film so you have no excuse. As soon as it comes out on DVD/BD, you must set aside some time to watch this. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: ∞/10<br />
Overall: 9.5/10<br />
<br />

Sincerely,<br />
Awesome Drummer

    As of writing this, I&#039;ve rewatched this movie around 5 times. But rewatching anime films is nothing out of the ordinary. Nor is picking up on new details and artistic touches each time; I&#039;ve spent a similar amount of time picking apart the meaning behind Naoko Yamada&#039;s other masterpieces, Koe no Katachi and K-On. Unlike those two, however, Liz and the Blue Bird manages to stay fresh every time.<br />
<br />
Firstly, to get this out of the way: Liz is, in my opinion, a functionally standalone film. Some knowledge on how Nozomi and Mizore&#039;s conflict played out in Hibike! Euphonium Season 2 may help, but it&#039;s not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review384749">
        necessary. <br />
<br />
Considering the almost laughably minute scope of Liz&#039;s plot - one setting, one ephemeral friendship, one tiny time frame - the idea of it being able to produce continuous novelty and excitement seems far-fetched. Liz&#039;s workaround, cliched as it may sound, is to dive into the micro, rather than the macro.<br />
<br />
Nowhere is this more prominent than in Liz&#039;s opening sequence. Koe no Katachi starts with bombastic youthful exuberance, a slideshow of Shoya and his friends living the time of their life backed up by a charming 1960s hit. K-On&#039;s movie chooses a similarly intriguing way to begin, subverting our expectations of the band before revealing it all to be part of a prank. But Liz hits a far different chord, with only one short exchange occurring in 6 minutes of otherwise narrative silence, supported by Kensuke Ushio&#039;s &quot;wind,glass,bluebird&quot;. For a movie about music, these wordless 6 minutes were as much an introduction to the main cast as a display of cinematographic and directorial flair. Nozomi drops her indoor shoes carelessly onto the ground, while Mizore elects to softly lay them down. Nozomi spins on the spot before entering the music room, but Mizore stands still, watching her friend walk further and further away into a gradually whitening screen. And that&#039;s JUST the first SIX minutes.<br />
<br />
At this point, Liz has already shown its hand. There are no major plot twists, no world-shaking drama, no big objective the characters must struggle to, but inevitably achieve. Life is rarely so outspoken and clear-cut, after all.<br />
<br />
Rather, Liz stakes its hopes on touching its audience with a humble, realistic depiction of youth. No one has the answers to everything, not unless you&#039;re an edgy 14-year old with the ability to hack a VR game from within. No one is ever confined to a stereotype, and no one ever really knows the true consequences of what they are doing. By placing such great emphasis on each action and reaction, we are able to grasp how the actions that one party regards as typical can be perceived by the other as monumental. Characters lie to the camera just as much as they lie to each other, appearing to respond in one way, but showing minute cracks in their facade which point towards another. Truly, nothing can really be condensed down to concepts as simplistic as &quot;tsundere&quot;, or &quot;happily ever after&quot;. We must learn to respect the different perspectives and emotions that everyone around us faces, lest we hurt our friends in ways we may not even be aware of.<br />
<br />
That attention to detail isn&#039;t just limited to our main duo either; Yuuko, Natsuki, and Ririka could&#039;ve been lazily written solely to advance the plot, but through the difference between their interactions with Nozomi and Mizore, we see how differently the two are perceived by their closest friends, and the delicate ground everyone must tread.<br />
<br />
It goes without saying too that Liz would not be nearly as outstanding without its music. The composition of the titular piece, &quot;Liz and the Blue Bird&quot;, is beautifully sad in its own right, but by scattering snippets of it throughout the film, its emotional payoff is that much more significant. Kensuke Ushio does just as good of a job in Liz as in Koe no Katachi, with individual tracks like &quot;reflexion,allegretto,you&quot; heightening the emotions evoked by their accompanying scenes, while changes in musical tone indicate shifts in emotional states and perspectives. For lovers of Liz&#039;s parent series, Hibike! Euphonium, this attention to musical detail would come as no surprise. <br />
<br />
Liz respects its characters. Liz respects the modest scope it starts with. Liz respects the uncertainty that clouds everyday existence and interaction. It would&#039;ve been so easy to invoke &quot;the power of friendship&quot;, creating rifts in Nozomi&#039;s and Mizore&#039;s relationship while introducing a larger challenge they had to overcome together so they would necessarily advance towards a happy ending. If one looks at the general plot outline of Liz, that may very well be the conclusion drawn. What does a &quot;happy&quot; ending mean, though? There&#039;s no clear goal achieved at the end of the show. No one&#039;s life has been significantly altered, and Nozomi&#039;s and Mizore&#039;s relationship barely changes from the movie&#039;s beginning.<br />
<br />
What&#039;s been achieved, however, is infinitely more important than some tangible victory. It is mutual understanding and acceptance, and in our day and age, it&#039;s something we all need.<br />

    Liz to Aoi Tori’s as good a sequel to Hibike Euphonium as I can hope to expect, and clearly they weren’t slacking off, much like the rest of the series, it’s got a rather simple story, but makes up for it with some outstanding animation, character, and direction, also this time around the main character is Mizore, the oboe player you forgot existed. <br />
<br />
I should probably talk about Mizore a bit since she’s the main character now and all, and to describe her briefly, she’s socially retarded – doesn’t talk much, too attached to her one friend, Nozomi, can’t really make decisions, and everyone else

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346820">
        thinks this is because she doesn’t like them. Ultimately, she is socially retarded, not for the purpose of comedy or moe (as is the case with Tomoko, Hitori Bocchi, Mikuru, or basically any other anime character), but because it is an integral part of her as a person. It is certainly more believable than the listed examples, and she is a compelling character for this reason, since the story is primarily about having to make a difficult decision, and the manner in which this person who has to decide for herself for once rather than just going with what Nozomi wants since that’s no longer a viable option, maybe I’m biased towards her since she’s almost an exact replica of how I behaved in high school, but biased as my reasoning may be, she is a splendidly written character. Considering that Kumiko does share a fair number of her aforementioned traits, I have to say that Mizore is the one I much preferred, maybe because making a ‘gweh’ every time you’re uncomfortable prevents them from displaying serious emotion from the character in the same way, and perhaps more importantly, proxemics. I’ll try and keep the comparisons to a minimum, but it is certainly something to consider, Reina seems to really enjoy violating Kumiko’s personal space, very much of the time, for very little reason, whereas Mizore is more or less entirely physically distant from everyone else, her and Nozomi are only seen close to each other during intimate moments, which by extension, gives them more weight.<br />
<br />
I mentioned direction earlier, which proxemics is a part of, so I should expand on that, the animation’s as good as the standard that Hibike already set, even if a little different, I wouldn’t say it looks any better or worse than the previous titles, nor do I particularly see much of a thematic or symbolic change either, perhaps it was just to make it unique for its own sake, which there’s nothing wrong with, only other thing to add is Reina looks remarkably like Mio Akiyama now, and also there is one scene in which she confronts Mizore, but apologises after going too far, which I considered to be out of character, but maybe that’s the reason why the art’s different, it’s from Mizore’s perspective, sort of like that one scene in Pulp Fiction where when it’s from Jules’ perspective the dialogue’s slightly different.<br />
More generally, the usage of visuals and cinematography is top notch, lots of close ups, long takes and POVs which creates a very personal feel, and one thing I really appreciated is how there was still action going on when they decided to show action during the intertitle, minor as it may be, never really liked how most the time they have to stop everything to show you a blank screen for the intertitle, it’s called a movie, I’m here to watch shit moving. Furthermore, the soundtrack was quality as well, in particular, how a lot of the time it wasn’t there, which may seem like a backwards thing to be praising for a series that is about music, but I can appreciate a director who understands that there are some scenes where the addition of music would only harm the overall experience, and given the nature of most of Mizore’s interactions, there are quite a lot of them, that isn’t to say there’s no music at all, they still end up performing, and it’s as good as ever, albeit if your interest is music first, characters second, then you would be better off with another Hibike title.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, Liz to Aoi Tori is a refinement of the Hibike formula, it detracts from the musical side of things, replaces its main characters who were already well written and produces even better ones, beyond the fact that I think the story of Liz and the Blue Bird (a fairytale that is a metaphor for the main characters) gets a little more screentime than is really necessary, and there were one or two instances of symbolism that I felt were a bit lacking in depth, apart from that, I don’t think I can really say anything negative about this film, every detail, every facet, every line of dialogue, everything is performed optimally, the artistry that went into the creation of the film is unparalleled.

    I feel like this movie is kinda of underrated... I would&#039;ve never watched it myself if I didn&#039;t know it was a part of Sound Euphonium. I mean apart from it, it&#039;s stand alone as a great movie, but without without the first part, I won&#039;t have watched this. Since I&#039;m not a guy who really cares for music in real life and with anime it&#039;s still pretty much the same thing. Since most of the time, I care more about the dialogue and the plot and what I&#039;m seeing then what I&#039;m hearing. But the music, not as in background music, but the piece

          <span style="display: none;" id="review359430">
        of Liz and The Blue Bird speaks on so many different volume... it is both moving and sad at the same time... it&#039;s a beautiful piece of art <br />
<br />
The visual is beautiful, it is so unique compared to most other anime and I loved it. It was simple but yet because of it, it convey so much emotion in their characters, the way the eye flickers, to the way the hair moves, or the way they move their legs or body, there is so much unspoken words being spoken through body language. Just from the first early scene how we see the two walking, how they way they move, it speaks to how their characters are. How they handle themselves and their personality, the more outgoing and the more shy quiet girl. <br />
<br />
One of my favorite friendship anime, yes you can say this is &quot;yuri bait&quot; or this is &quot;yuri&quot; but whatever, I&#039;m not here to debate that. Just taking it at face value, this is a beautiful friendship that we see between two girls. To truly love someone, we must learn to let them go, so that they can truly be free and grow. <br />
<br />
I can sit here and try to breakdown this whole anime and there&#039;s a lot you can say about it, but I&#039;ll just say this is a beautiful work of art and one of my favorite movie of all time. The plot is so simple but it&#039;s so relatable. I think as you get older, this becomes more relatable, but as someone who&#039;s younger, I guess it won&#039;t relate to them as well. For me, just thinking about all those friends I love, who I have to part way with, just because we walk different path now doesn&#039;t mean we aren&#039;t no longer friends or stopped caring for one another. The whole thing is, we&#039;re still on the same road, just it&#039;s split up now, but we can always trace back and be glad we had a friend who once walked the path with us so we weren&#039;t alone. Even if we feel alone now... the only way to truly feel alone is have truly felt loved. <br />
<br />
This is a masterpiece, one of the few films I will truly say is 10/10. Even though I would give other things 10/10 but more of my pure enjoyment and my personal bias opinion and not as a critic. But this one as both a fan and critic, I would say deserves to be called that.

    I went into this not knowing what to expect, although I&#039;m always excited to see work from Yamada. <br />
<br />
From start to finish, Liz to Aoi Tori is gorgeous. Everything from the meticulously crafted sound, to the dreamlike art, to the brief but intense character development was phenomenal. <br />
<br />
Story: <br />
The backbone of this movie is its use of the fairy tale &quot;Liz and the Bluebird&quot;. The real events of the story intertwine beautifully with the warmth and simplicity of the fairy tale, complementing it just enough without being overbearing. Despite the tip toeing pace and the quiet atmosphere, Liz to Aoi Tori never spares a dull

        frame and thoroughly keeps your eyes on the screen.<br />
<br />
Art: <br />
If it weren&#039;t for the sound design, I would call the art the biggest draw of this movie. Not only do we get to enjoy the expected carefully illustrated cuteness we&#039;ve come to associate with yamada, but we also experience a new and different warmth coming from the fairy tale depictions. Both are stunning in their own way.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The first scenes immediately set the mood, using everything from footsteps to the swinging of a backpack to create a sound that could tell the story entirely on its own. The music is, as expected, beautiful as well.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Despite its short run time, the characters are developed smoothly and carefully. Their moods, decisions, and behavior all locks into place in a way that&#039;s not too jarring as to be unrealistic but not too predictable as to be unexciting. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I&#039;m very glad I saw this. I enjoyed every second and am excited to see it again. <br />

    Naoko Yamada directs a masterpiece in Liz and the Blue Bird, a beautiful story between two close and longtime friends who run into a hurdle in their relationship and as a result are both forced to take a step back and reexamine their feelings toward each other.<br />
<br />
To get this out of the way immediately, the events of this movie take place after the events of the last episode of Hibike! Euphonium Season 2.<br />
<br />
You can certainly watch this movie without having seen the Hibike! Euphonium TV animation series beforehand, because it was made to be a standalone spinoff to said anime series, but having done so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review305317">
        will allow you to quickly get all the things happening in the background so you can focus your attention more on the sad, beautiful, and delicate story this movie has to show.<br />
<br />
Now, I&#039;m a huge fan of the Hibike! Euphonium anime series for its inspiring tale of working hard as you reach for your dreams. I particularly liked the club&#039;s advisor, Taki-sensei&#039;s, blunt and unforgiving attitude towards improvement because honestly, that&#039;s the best way to go about in the real world. But I digress. In almost direct contrast to the anime series&#039; focus on music, rehearsals, the ever-present goal of winning that coveted gold at Nationals... this Liz and the Blue Bird spinoff focuses on much more human and close to the heart concepts, such as friendship and learning to see when a relationship is starting to become unhelpful to a person and then taking steps forward to resolve that.<br />
<br />
The entirety of the movie&#039;s ninety minute runtime leaves little room for any of the familiar scenes in the anime series. Sure, there are a few slice-of-life scenes (an art that KyoAni has perfected) and rehearsals here and there but they definitely take the backseat in this movie. The movie takes place in the same high school and in the same wind ensemble club room that fans of the anime series have grown to be fond of, but the focal point, the viewpoint... the cinematography itself demands that you focus your attention on the two main characters in this movie, Yoroizuka Mizore and Kasaki Nozomi.<br />
<br />
Mizore is your quiet and soft-spoken girl who is close friends with Nozomi, your lively and outgoing girl. They are both third-years at high school and members of the wind ensemble club. Both know that this is their last chance to enjoy their youthful and carefree lives before they step out into the unforgiving real world. Luckily, they are both also the aces of the club in their respective instruments so they get a chance to play a critical solo part in the club&#039;s upcoming competitions. That&#039;s a pretty good way to go out, if I do say so myself. But I feel what I&#039;ve just said in this paragraph does not do these two&#039;s relationship enough justice.<br />
<br />
The two of them have been friends since middle school. Nozomi is very introverted Mizore&#039;s first friend and definitely holds a special place in her heart. However, this relationship seems hopelessly one-sided as Nozomi, being the outgoing person that she is, views Mizore as simply another friend. Their relationship is made to go a little deeper though when Nozomi invites Mizore to join the wind ensemble club. Eventually, spending time together both in and out of club allows Nozomi to also see that Mizore is a special friend to her. Their relationship then hit a rough spot during their first year in high school but has since been resolved (watch Hibike! Euphonium Season 2 Episodes 1-4 for more details!), but not without leaving behind lasting anxiety and uncertainty in each others&#039; hearts, especially Mizore&#039;s. This movie does a stellar job of portraying the two&#039;s pure, delicate friendship and how they resolve the aforementioned anxiety and uncertainty by reexamining their relationship.<br />
<br />
From the get-go, Liz and the Blue Bird sets very down-to-earth expectations for itself and that never wavers throughout the movie. It doesn&#039;t try to be the next big hit in high school romances, or drama, and definitely not in the music genre like its parent story. It is, very roughly summarized, nothing but a story between two close friends who are nearing the end of their high school lives. The movie both begins and ends with a normal, everyday scene of the two of them walking to or from school and engaging in typical youthful conversation, albeit a little less chatty than expected due to the nature of one of them. From an outsider&#039;s point of view they would certainly look just like typical best friends in high school..<br />
<br />
And this is where this movie&#039;s beauty lies hidden. We see as the movie progresses that there is so much more going on between these two seemingly inseparable friends. The movie takes care to use every precious scene with detail and craftsmanship that turns an otherwise stereotypical &quot;hIgH sChOoL&quot; anime movie into a true work of art.<br />
<br />
Whether it is Mizore&#039;s constant uncertain glances at Nozomi, or in general just how much Nozomi&#039;s typical friendly acts and words toward her can turn her blushing red in an instant. Whether it is Nozomi&#039;s extroverted-ness shining out as she interacts with everyone. Every single emotion that the two characters feel in this movie get animated with clear distinction. You can physically feel Nozomi&#039;s surprise when Mizore asks if she can invite someone else. You can physically feel Mizore&#039;s hurting when Nozomi deliberately snobs her. I&#039;ve read in an interview with Naoko Yamada that she took extra care to make sure not to &quot;disrespect&quot; the two characters&#039; complex emotions and damn did she accomplish that in this movie! Interestingly and as an aside, Yamada showed increased interest in directing Mizore and Nozomi&#039;s story way before production and this goes to show how talented, passionate people who like what they are doing can really create the best works.<br />
<br />
Probably my favorite part of this movie is just how entrancing the relationship between Mizore and Nozomi is. On one hand, you know they are close friends and that chances are high they will remain so for the rest of their lives. But Mizore&#039;s increasing uncertainty toward Nozomi feels like it put their relationship on knife&#039;s edge; a bubble that has grown too big. Another big rife in their friendship could very well put it to a irreversible end, but you can feel that Mizore is taking great pains (at least for someone as introverted as her) to make sure it never comes to that point, ignoring everyone else as she only really has eyes for Nozomi. On the other hand, Nozomi is just being her usual outgoing self, confident that Mizore will always look up to her, but even she comes to a point where she realizes just how vast the difference between the two of them really is and makes up her own resolve toward their friendship. At this point I can only say that my number one ship in anime has safely become MizoreXNozomi (friendship ofc) and I really hope things work out well for the two of them going further.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been focusing on the two main characters and their story in this review so far because after all, they are the highlight of this movie and imo, where the nail truly hits the coffin. But that is not to say that the other elements of the movie do not deserve mention. In particular, the accompanying soundtrack was really good and silent tracks were used with care in the movie&#039;s more emotional scenes. Mizore&#039;s oboe explosion at the climax was a thing of beauty to listen to as well. The different artistic style and redesigned characters really help to make this movie feel parallel to the anime series. <br />
<br />
Liz and the Blue Bird is not a grand story, and doesn&#039;t try nor have to be. It&#039;s not a tale between fated lovers, nor a huge chronicle of working hard towards sweet sweet victory. Hell, it&#039;s not even a good drama! This movie cannot be viewed with the typical expectations that its genres seem to imply, because it deliberately exists as an independent plot point in the Hibike! Euphonium universe and therefore cannot be viewed like the anime series. I&#039;m sure this movie&#039;s events will only get passing mention in the upcoming Chikai no Finale movie or a Season 3 (fingers crossed), and yet they have stuck with me. It&#039;s a combination of the pure and delicate love story between Mizore and Nozomi and how they reexamine and advance their relationship forward and the sheer amount of detail and craftsmanship that went into making sure both their emotions got properly expressed and felt on-screen. The sound (as expected from a music-oriented series) and art-house like visual style were the cherries on top.<br />
<br />
Liz and the Blue Bird is a must-watch for anime fans period, but even more so for those looking to take a break from all the serious anime that have come out recently. For those that want a work executed to near perfection with skill and craftsmanship only made possible with a dedicated and talented director who respects their characters&#039; humanity and emotions, this movie is right up your alley. People who don&#039;t care much about technical stuff and only want good content will still find Mizore and Nozomi&#039;s personal story to be a truly moving one, even if the setting seems a bit too ordinary and grounded. Even then, this movie reaches level of detail and craftsmanship seen in few other anime and that alone is enough to warrant me giving it a perfect score.

    I think the only thing that has bothered me most about the Sound! Euphonium series is how often discussion of it tends to descend into questions of whether or not it&#039;s queer bait. <br />
<br />
In my eyes Sound! Euphonium is a series about queerness through the eyes of those who cannot be honest about their sexuality. Words and phrases like &quot;love&quot; and &quot;romance&quot; are tossed around by characters in an ambiguous manner because they themselves cannot understand their own feelings, or do not even recognize these feelings as a valid form of expression. Nowhere else in the series is this more obvious than the film Liz

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414739">
        and the Blue Bird.<br />
<br />
Liz and The Blue bird swaps out the bombast and catharsis of the original series for something much more nuanced and intimate, it&#039;s a film that lingers, favoring imagery and subtext over overt statements. Characters don&#039;t scream and cry about their character arcs and the music rarely builds to an overpowering and overly emotional crescendo. For a film about characters that play music it is often very quiet, it&#039;s filled with simple scenes of characters simply walking or even looking into a fish tank. Liz gives it&#039;s characters time to breathe, to think about themselves and what they want and eventually to grow. It is quite possibly one of the most beautiful examples of queer cinema in anime and even in live action film. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s positively beautiful and gay as hell

    Animation-wise and directing, absolutely phenomenal. Unfortunately, the writing was just straight up bad in most aspects. The core romance was really powerful, definitely a good character dynamic there on the compositional level, and some strong emotions are brought out, but the actual characterization, the dialogue, the structure, etc. was just really subpar. The picture book scenes also didn&#039;t really do anything worthwhile and could have been abbreviated to dialogueless 20 to 30 second chunks if they really needed to be there.<br />
Regardless, it&#039;s easy to do this kind of character animation-driven storytelling wrong, especially since it often feels gimmicky, but KyoAni has always done it impeccably

    I have never cried for as long as i have in a movie ever. Genuinely. There were multiple points in this film where my eyes were stinging after having the tears just set in my eyes for ten minutes as a time. Granted, I was eating a solid burrito with salsa out of my spice tolerance so it seemed logical. <br />
<br />
Then I finished eating… I was still crying. <br />
<br />
I had intended to watch this film earlier than this, after I had finished the series of Hibike Euphonium. Yet for some reason I put it off. Life seemed busy I suppose. But as my yearning for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406295">
        more Naoko Yamada grew mighty and mightier, I had to check it out. For my love of her visions, and my curiosity of her upcoming projects. <br />
<br />
My oh my what I was missing. <br />
<br />
The aesthetics of the film already clicked with me upon seeing images of it, prior to full viewing. The character designs have this beautiful long and stretched quality. Everyone looks a lot more humanoid but int he best sort of stylised ways. It gives this instant connection and empathy through how soft &amp; emotional the characters appear. Futoshi Nishiya, the character designer, spreads this quality through his other designs such as in The Shape of Voice. Where that same empathy can be felt. There’s an aspect to these designs where they seem like fantastical beings who are somehow only managing to survive. Which fits well with the struggles in this film. The film presentation is also top notch. Manipulating the frequently beautiful techniques of the digital anime medium that KyoAni have perfected over the past decade. The backgrounds have a dynamic form of realistic, apropos of the very grounded human drama whilst not being visually drab. <br />
<br />
With all that has been mentioned, character design, backgrounds, and drama, the film begins with these correlating elements to introduce us to the focus of the film. It is with these attributes that create this chilling and delicate human experience that rooted me into this film head first. This is a film that so gorgeously illustrates the struggles to communicate. The interlocking conflicts that build, stemming from this moment, is a beast understandable to myself and many others. I began to really feel sorry in here as I gazed at Mizore’s, the protagonist’s, attempts to bridge and get close to people. It’s this heartbreaking difficulty that you feel as though you also haven’t built up the strength to manage it. Pushing you to be happy for her to maybe even gain the ability to speak and create an understanding between people. It’s something that tussled with me most in this film. Just watching as some characters can’t get people to understand them really shout in my head “I know”. <br />
<br />
It’s not just Mizore that is unable to communicate properly. All of the characters are draped in this cover of unclarity which they are attempting to free themselves from and get to doing what they want. This being best communicated through the superb direction work. Naoko Yamada is known to have an infamous interest in the symbolic meaning of legs. With this film rooting that interest to its very core. The cutaways between legs always having something extra to say about the barriers between each character. Legs will even be explicitly shown changing positions as to correlate with the change in situation or role in the scene. Stand out scenes are in the beginning of the film, where there is a lot of fixed shots on legs that expertly communicate the problems our characters face. The confessions of Noizomi also stand out to me, where they effectively convey the change and reflection her character through her change in position. These details are charming with how they add dressing to the cinematography and give you something else to stare at. But ultimately, you grow to find it a very useful tool to understanding and connecting to the film that they become so important to your viewing. And there’s an appropriate amount of thought put into each scene where you can simply focus on legs as the dramatic visual to inform you on the conflict present. Frankly its hard to recall a particularly powerful moment because the imagery is so consistently embedded. But it’s also my first time viewing this film, and since it was quite an emotionally explosive session it’s fine that I didn’t soak up everything. <br />
<br />
But I would be remiss if I just kept ogling at legs this whole time. Not that I always could anyway due to my tear stained eyes. My ears were very active throughout this film. The moments of orchestra in the original series always impressed me with how they were able to channel such emotion. Even to change the emotion with the same piece at a different time in the episode. That sense of emotion is ever present here. Especially with the swathes of silence found scattered throughout, the music delivers in portraying the perspectives and struggles of these characters and it really strikes accord with me. Much like it’s their secondary voice that we can maybe understand better than the words that presently escape them. For me at least, I can hear and feel that voice. <br />
<br />
That is what truly devastated me at the climax of the film. All of these things unifying in this brilliant moment that was just so beautiful and powerful. It was something I could just understand so instantly. And it was as though the film proved to me at that moment how great it was. Not to say all was only revealed until that moment. But that, the mountain we climbed lead us to a place that was just what the journey was taking us towards. And that it was so satisfying to witness it, and follow everything as we came back down. <br />
<br />
I haven’t mentioned it at all but the concept of the musical piece Liz and The Bluebird is also wonderfully integrated into the story. As are the subsequent scenes that bridge between the film. Really it’s something I don’t want to explore here because it is so beautifully put in the film. That is something which must be experienced on your own. <br />
<br />
The one thing that doesn’t seem perfectly set with me is the pacing of this film. While I don’t find it an issue, it does have the sense that this is an extended episode of the TV series. Ultimately, I find that nature to the film charming. And if it is a longer TV episode, it is the best episode there is. This is something I’m keen to explore and feel towards upon rewatching. This uncertainty is why I would say the story as being a 9/10 but the film 10/10 overall. It is the immense lack of distaste or disinterest on first viewing that makes me feel so strongly about this film. In terms of firsthand impressions, this film has successfully captured my love. And I applaud it. <br />
<br />
Quick things i loved without saying much:<br />
- Reed making is such a cool looking craft and I love how Mizore makes her own. <br />
- Band members hanging in musical groups is super cute and I love to see the little communities formed here. <br />
- Taki-sensei once again giving inadvertent life advice makes me wonder how aware he is of fundamentally changing the lives of these performers haha. <br />
<br />
If I am to mention rankings, I don’t know if I would say this is definitely better than The Shape of Voice. But I’m willing to say they’re both equally fantastic and are wonderful benchmarks of Naoko Yamada’s bright and beautiful future as a director. I certainly hope to see her make as many she feels need. But all the more, it is these relatable and touchingly executed stories that invest me in the media of film. And i am always happy to see more. <br />
<br />
Thank you KyoAni, may you heal and grow to be stronger than ever before.

    Above all else, no offense but I don&#039;t generally like music anime. I think that its exhausting and boring regardless of the amount I attempt to concentrate and watch properly. It&#039;s simply not my kind of thing. However, Liz to Aoi Tori became my first music anime that I actually watched until the end without yawning, getting bored or pausing it. Thanks to the fact that it&#039;s just a movie, Liz to Aoi Tori is, as I would like to think an incredible anime music movie that indicated how love is like a cage through music. <br />
<br />
What I enjoyed the most about this movie is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318016">
        the music. In spite of tuning in to relaxing melodies during night time when I hit the sack. It&#039;s nice to hear relaxing songs in a movie once in a while. Sort of reminded me of..Uh..Forgot..Disney films? Yeah..I think so. Well, yeah, I also adored the connection between the two main female characters ( Mizore and Nozomi ). Since I&#039;m a Shoujo ai and Yuri lover, I find the vibe going on between them entertaining to watch ( although I wanted their relationship to be more &quot;engaging&quot;).<br />
<br />
[SPOILER START]<br />
What I hate about this movie is the last scene. Seriously. She just turned and then suddenly the credits started rolling. What the profanity. I swear to the gods that they really were going to kiss. C&#039;mon man, at least let me see them kiss and I&#039;d be happy. <br />
[SPOILER END] <br />
<br />
Overall, I enjoyed the movie a lot. I find it relaxing and entertaining at the same time. Kind of reminded me of the old times when I still play piano. Ah, the nostalgia. Anyways, I recommend this to everyone. Not forcing you to watch it, but you should check it out. <br />
