    &quot;This adaptation is like a painting, it has a beautiful frame that could be the story itself presented and maintained throughout the show, and the remarkable artistic quality of the main characters enclosed in this frame that is compared to the hypnotic and vivid sunset that fascinates our eyes and earns our total attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
At first, you may be a bit skeptical after reading the summaries of this anime, the central theme is a bit unusual, a ballroom anime. Also, you can consider, a dance competition, another anime about some championships or tournaments that could be similar to any other sports anime, but you could be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265355">
        wrong. Ballroom e Youkoso is a fantastic adaptation that combines excellent storytelling with fabulous art design and captivates viewers by making them want more. Sadly, not all is perfect, the use of CGI could be weird and creates an ugly contrast between the characters&#039; art and the scene background but it isn&#039;t a big issue.  <br />
<br />
Story 8<br />
<br />
The anime has two main story arcs. The first one, the introduction of Tatara Fujita, the main character. An important fact is the display of Tatara&#039;s problems and insecurity. In addition, this arc presents the secondary characters, such as Kiyoharu, Shizuku, Mako, and Gaju. These characters enhance the narrative, the dynamics of the dance and the tournaments. They create an initial rivalry between Tatara, but the most exciting part is that they are still mates and support each other in their way. In other words, it is a healthy rivalry that is needed to help in the growth of Tatara and does not conceive the effect of a villain or a pompous competitor as we can see in the typical sports adaptations. Simultaneously, this arc reveals the differences that exist between the characters and establishes a challenging atmosphere among all of them.<br />
<br />
The second arc presents the other main character, Chinatsu Hiyama, and you can feel the progression of Tatara. Chinatsu is the opposite of Tatara. She has a dazzling personality, is rebellious and very strong. She also has a lot of experience in dance, so on many occasions, she shows her displeasure about the way of leading proposed by Tatara. She can not understand Tatara&#039;s personality. However, their relationship turned up due to Tatara&#039;s personality. For my eyes, Chinatsu is the perfect complement for Tatara.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, you can see a new secondary character, Kugimiya Masami. He is a shadowy character who could be Tatara&#039;s antagonist. For several viewers, including me, Kugimiya could fit the description of an odious competitor with some secrets. This figure is very dark and mysterious. He hates Tatara, and even the art portrays him with a faint aura. However, after a closer look, this character has been affected by several &quot;life&quot; problems that could be a reflection of Tatara if he abandoned his passion for dancing and improving. Kugimiya even compared himself to Tatara, and that bothered him more. All those elements created a beautiful story with a good rhythm, excellent narrative and with outstanding characters that can feel real.<br />
<br />
To conclude, the standard sports anime could not cope with Ballroom and Youkoso. The series has everything: A story of high quality, with a good pacing, realistic characters, sadness, joy, need, frustration, etc. The anime emphasizes concepts such as trust between couples, their understanding, and conviction. We can observe the constant need to overcome and the hard work required to achieve a change both personally and competitively.<br />
<br />
This anime has two scenarios. The first, the interaction of the characters outside the &quot;ballroom.&quot; A rational world where the characters are beings with needs, problems, and feelings. The second world is inside the ballroom. A place with its own sets of rules where the score and the leader-companion relationship matter. This ambiance adds pressure and rivalry to the story, creates a dynamic where feelings of the characters bloom. Maybe my criteria could be biased since I have dance competition experience. However, seeing the relationship between partner and leader brought me many good and bad memories such as the foot pain after an event =D. To rephrase it, Tomo was able to convey those feelings to the audience, and that made me feel very happy because it stands out the realism.<br />
<br />
There are still some problems with the story, however. The most visible is the lack of a real ending. Tomo fell ill, so she could not advance in the manga story. The animation exceeds the progress of manga story, so the conclusion of the adaptation could be original compared to the continuation of the manga, and it felt a bit rushed. Therefore, there may be reasonable speculation about when, or if, the date of the second season.<br />
<br />
Characters 8<br />
<br />
The adaptation has a good number of characters. Perhaps the most relevant is the personality of the couples in competition. For example, the pair of Tatara in the first arc is utterly different if compared to the second arc because the couple has a distinct personality and that reflects the way the couple dance and act. For example, Mako is more delicate and shy compared to Chinatsu, who is more rebellious and strong. I&#039;m sure that Tatara will continue to grow in the manga, and it is likely that a relationship between Chinatsu and Tatara will arise, but we can not rule out a possible attraction between Tatara and Shizuku.<br />
<br />
The characters:<br />
<br />
Tatara Fujita. He is a shy and insecure person who cares for everyone and, in particular, for his partner. Tatara was looking for a place to fit in, and the dance was a door of change for him. However, he is in constant development, his features remain constant, but explode during competitions. Maybe this character is a bit complex, but that is what makes it real.<br />
<br />
Chinatsu Hiyama. Even if she was added halfway through the entire adaptation, her impact is gigantic. The personality of Chinatsu changed the dynamics of the narrative and directly affected Tatara&#039;s character. She is a rebel, strong, and has a lot of experience in dancing. She does not visualize Tatara as a good leader, sometimes she tries to follow him, but everything ends in constant frustration. However, she gives Tatara a chance to the point that both fight hard and evolve. It is a character with whom I feel connected, and I think there is a lot to see about its complexity.<br />
<br />
Kiyoharu Hyoudou: You can say that he is the best dancer in the series. He is very talented and may be Tatara&#039;s main rival in the future of the story. He does not have any opponent that overcomes him. However, he helps and guides Tatara as he considers him as a rival with enormous potential and with a lot of raw skill.<br />
<br />
Shizuku Hanaoka: She is the best companion. However, it could be said that she depends on Kiyoharu&#039;s leadership. She finds Tatara&#039;s unusual dance skills to the point that she decides to wait for his evolution and supports him. It is still too early to see if there are sentiments of her towards Tatara.<br />
<br />
The remaining characters are essential as well, but I don&#039;t want to prolong any further.<br />
<br />
Art and Sound 8<br />
<br />
Ballroom e Youkoso is quite impressive regarding sound and illustrations. The art follows the dynamics of dance and is quite clean. The movement and the characters, in general, is real. Usually, the scenes make the eyes focus on the pairs because of the color palette and the details. However, a high level of detail and quality isn&#039;t maintained in the surroundings (CGI use). Besides, if the eyes change from the principal observation point, you will notice some awful disparity between the surroundings and the couples in some scenes, do not let that change your decision towards the anime. Several good animations do not have the budget to fill the whole scene with a high artistic quality; sadly this one is the case. <br />
<br />
Lastly, some camera angles can give the impression of disproportion because the postures of the different dancing styles are complicated, but it must be taken into account that they are positions with a high degree of realism. The color palette is very vivid and uses a high contrast of colors where you can see the beauty of the couples, and this marks the details and character traits of the cast.<br />
<br />
About the sound, it&#039;s awesome. The series uses a vibrant score. In addition, it is listened to in a very soft way and keeps the rhythm and the action going. This helps the movement of the scenes especially the dances. The OPs and EDs are excellent and enjoyable. In my personal opinion, OP1 and ED2 are the best.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9<br />
<br />
I can not complain about this show; it is very entertaining. The narration is very fluid with an acceptable rhythm, creating the perfect environment for any spectator. The characters are complex and stand out. However, for some anime fans, it is possible that this type of genre is not pleasant or will complain by the lame use of the CGI,  but it is not a reason to overlook this fantastic adaptation. I&#039;ll be waiting for a continuation of the manga, and I hope that in the next few years the animation of Ballroom and Youkoso will continue.

    Competition is a beautiful thing. It makes us strive to accomplish, to win, and hope that we can simply be good at something in our lives. When it comes to expressing talent, we try to be the show-off and express it like a form of art. For a guy named Tatara Fujita, he just wants to prove to the world that he can be good at something. That is, one day…he discovers the world of ballroom dancing.<br />
<br />
Watching Ballroom e Youkoso (Welcome to the Ballroom) feels like taking a journey down memory lane. I’m talking about the type of memory lane where you were once a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265352">
        kid and wanted to prove everyone you had talent in something. Academics, sports, art, acting, singing. Just anything in general that make your friend go “wow, I didn’t know you could do that!” As such, this anime is one that I found remarkably realistic and relatable. The first few episodes doesn’t take long to establish the principle cast along with its intention.<br />
<br />
I’ll be honest here. Tatara is a character that won’t be very easy to accept for most people at first glance. He has a meek personality and seems to overestimate himself on certain circumstances. This is shown in the beginning when Tatara expresses to professional dancer Sengoku that he wants to be a pro rather than just to dance. His initial attitude makes him look like a fool as dancing isn’t just something that can perfected like a click of a switch. My impression of Tatara made me realize that while he sets high expectations for himself, he does have potential but needs the right people and time to unlock it. Luckily, Tatara gets the opportunity at the Ogawara Dance Studio where other talented dancers gather to perfect their work. From the studio, Tatara also meets the very talented and beautiful Shizuku. She becomes a source of inspiration for Tatara as he strives to improve and become a pro. Throughout this show, Tatara embraces the art of ballroom dancing and becomes very determined to prove himself. From an amateur to an inspiring ballroom dancer, his character can really grow to people as we see his progress.<br />
<br />
The storytelling builds on many fronts although most of it still follows Tatara and his journey. He deals with personal issues, social problems, and also establishes rivalries with certain characters he meets. At the same time, an important part of this show involve him building important relationships with others. Two particular characters stands out the most: Mako Akagi and Chinatsu Hiyama. As dancing partners, Tatara’s relationship with both of these girls vary in attitude. Mako and Tatara has a friendly relationship that is based on trust, respect, and strong spirit. On the other hand, Tatara and Chinatsu’s relationship is more borderline towards competitiveness. Not to mention, Chinatsu already has a dancing background and doesn’t tolerate a weak partner. Throughout the anime, we see how Chinatsu begins to accept him more with their growing trust. In respect, Tatara also develops as a person as he crafts his own dancing style so that it’s not just his partner carrying their dances. Whether he realizes it or not, Tatara even has influence on others. This includes making Mako realize how skilled she really is, restoring Chinatsu’s love for dancing, and even influencing Shizuku to improve herself to be better. In retrospect, this anime steps over the line to make Tatara a more likeable character as time goes on.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I can’t really say all the main cast gets decent screen time and development. While Shizuku is Tatara’s initial inspiration, she doesn’t get much highlight later on in this show. Don’t expect this anime to focus much on Tatara’s love life either. While it’s obvious that Tatara crushes over Shizuku from the beginning, the show makes it clear that she prefers dancing rather than finding a boyfriend. This also applies to Tatara’s other dancing partners so if romance is something on your mind, then look elsewhere. Also, be aware that this anime focuses a lot on dancing. By a lot, I mean a LOT with all types of dances, music, and style. If you’re not a fan of dancing, it may take some time to enjoy this show. Ballroom dancing is portrayed as a fierce competition on the dance floor with some episodes dedicating their entire time to it. Luckily, this anime is quite a faithful adaptation for what it had to work with. With only some minor differences, it’s an anime that really made me glad it got adapted. However, there are times that I wish the anime picked up the pace with its extensive background storytelling, especially in later episodes.<br />
<br />
Adapted by Production I.G., this was really the number one choice. They are known for making other anime that involve competition come to life. (ex. Haikyu, All Out!, Kuroko no Basket) For this particular anime, they leave a memorable impression with the art style and character designs. The biggest selling point is the smooth camera angles and timings. When the competition gets fierce, it really draws out the talents of the dancers with their body movements. Each movement is precisely timed to show their potential with colorful aesthetics. It further amplifies them through clever facial expressions. The dancing outfits in this anime are also memorable for their coloring and hair style, in particular for the female characters. It’s not to be interpreted as fan service but rather a work of art. On the other hand, there are some body parts in this anime that can be distracting. The one most worth mentioning is the overly extensive necks that can make viewers point fingers at.<br />
<br />
At the core of its technical feature is the music. It’s what makes the ballroom dancing come to life along with its vivid choreography. The anime mixes in a variety that includes jazz, latin, classic, and among others. Director Yoshimi Itazu really made an impression through his work by allowing the music to do the storytelling on many occasions. Without words, many of the dancing segments feels like a dream and as if time itself stopped to showcase the characters’ talents. The music supplements that with its directing. Voice character mannerism is also well performed with characters like Chinatsu, Hyoudou, and the Akagi siblings. Both the OP and ED theme songs are also worth listening to for their rhythm.<br />
<br />
As a show with a fierce competitive energy, this one might seem to be intimidating to watch at first. However, it’s a show that I can recommend to anyone even if its selling points doesn’t hit all the marks. From its character cast to storytelling, Ballroom e Youkoso is a well-adapted manga that focuses on what it intended to without betraying expectations. Sure, some characters are not as well focused compared to the others. There are also times when you wish the story can just move its pace faster. However, it’s still a show that gives competition a powerful meaning.<br />

    Have I properly read the manga, Welcome to the Ballroom, which this anime is based on? No, I haven’t, but I have looked into it extensively given my experience with this adaptation, and frankly, I’ve seen more than enough to know without a shadow of a doubt the original creator put immeasurable work and passion into realizing her manga, and while you could make the same argument regarding the work ethic of the anime adaptation team, you cannot argue for the anime’s painfully transparent budgeting, scheduling, and staffing. Yes, that’s right, ladies and gentlemen. The gods of the industry, the titans of the medium, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265360">
        most critically respected pantheon of animation talent, the one and only Production IG themselves—even if their B Team is the one responsible—finally made what I think we can all agree to be a bad adaptation.<br />
<br />
Welcome to the Ballroom has the sleek character designs, clean art style, and sharp linework of Production IG’s previous standard setter of the sports genre, Haikyuu, but it has not nearly the same quality of animation. What made IG’s manga adaptations as of late so shockingly good despite having their roots in the most banal of shounen/shoujo tropes was the fact the studio bestowed upon them the first class animation fidelity no other studio could ever even dream of coordinating which they’d given to their most ambitious of originals, or at least something close. Be it a dime a dozen shounen sports anime like Haikyuu or Kuroko no Basuke or a dime a dozen shoujo romcom anime like Kimi ni Todoke or Ao Haru Ride, no matter what their producers saddled them with, Production IG didn’t let their name falter. As much as I poke fun at the cartoonish writing of the aforementioned Kuroko no Basuke, I’m still able to acknowledge how the over-the-top animation really made the athletic prowess, personal style, and spunky attitude of the characters pop, or in other words, what made the show itself good and at all worthwhile.<br />
<br />
As a terminally inactive, frail nonentity of a failed human being who never leaves their home for leisure, I’ve never liked sports nor those who played them, but the detailed artwork and lavish animation of Haikyuu handily convinced me of and pushed me to respect just how taxing the sport was on the bodies of the players and how hard they had to fight to get as good as they’d gotten. By the intricately apparent strain and pulse of their shoulders and knees, you could tell precisely how exhausted the characters were becoming over the course of their strenuous matches, and not long after I came to see the love and care put into the animation, I gained genuine admiration for the teams and individuals working themselves to the bone for victory on the court which I now appreciate to’ve been a battlefield all along. Welcome to the Ballroom, on the other hand, has—from a consistency standpoint, at least—exactly none of this attention to detail found within the seemingly endless extra frames only studios the likes of IG or Kyoto Animation can deliver on nor the outrageously impressive IG sakuga, because they just weren’t there.<br />
<br />
Most of the dance sequences resort to panning over still frames, and the background dancers are invariably CG, with movement cycles so unbelievably clunky and downright ugly, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I’m not so utterly moronic as to think any of this was done in-house, but the fact remains IG produced it, and that fact is deeply disheartening. The driving motivation of our main character, Tatara, was the fact he’d lived his life as a nobody, and seeing professional dancers do their thing made him realize just how much he wanted to be “seen” in the same glamour, himself. While this is a well written and widely sympathetic motivation anyone can invest in, especially given how good the writing in this show is, the fact we, the audience, are being sold on this desire of his by such a lackluster display of animation and out-of-place CGI leaves us thinking the unavoidable thought, “You were really inspired by THAT?” And it’s even sadder, yet, because when you watch either opening animation as well as the limited sakuga done by in-house IG staff from Takashi Mukouda to even Shinji Hashimoto, you can really see what could have been.<br />
<br />
Though, what was—finally putting aside the constant reminder of animation quality unbefitting of Production IG—was actually a really, really, really good show filled to the brim with both narrative and directorial inspiration and a lovable, empathetic, vibrant cast of amazing characters. People are equally likable and hatable when they need to be, and the story progresses at a life-like pace which allows you to notice and gives you the time to appreciate the maturation of the characters’ respective dancing styles and moral outlooks on the sport as well as their interpersonal relationships with one another. And speaking of, the character chemistry in this show is usually as charming as can be, and whenever things do turn sour, your experience with each and every actor has you in such deep understanding of wherever they’re coming from, no drama ever feels awkward or manufactured. Even said drama, which is something usually responsible for ruining entire shows in my book, was some seriously compelling stuff and easy to empathize with thanks to all the aforementioned expertise of the script getting me so immersed.<br />
<br />
I know turning around and saying I was “immersed” in the show I just spent nine millennia whining about the visuals of, visuals which are inherently required to make the presentation believable and able to be immersed in to begin with, may seem contradictory, but my word choice was accurate nevertheless. Sure, I can bitch and moan all day about IG taking themselves down a few pegs, but does this show looking average as opposed to stunning mean it looks as downright hideous as most anime coming out of most studios? Of course not, and even taking that moment to praise the show’s writing neglected to make mention of how every single aspect of the show’s production with the exception of the base animation was just as stellar as any other proper IG show you can think of. The voice actors and actresses are definitely not getting paid enough, and some of these characters, especially the cute girls like Mako, had me down for their characters on their voice performances alone. Be they delivering jokes, laughs, or tears, there wasn’t a single vocalist whose performance disappointed in the slightest, and their oh my god GORGEOUS character designs only pronounced the strength of personality even more, because despite being an underanimated show, it’s not like Production IG would ever dare to air something with off-model artwork. Rousing music, intricate sound, striking color, and beautiful backgrounds all make it so the more facets of the production I sit back and appreciate having accepted the lackluster animation just leaves me with more and more small things to easily and proudly praise, even if I’d call show as a whole a disappointment in the long run. There’s countless scenes throughout the show which wholeheartedly ingratiate you with the impassioned emotions of the characters and the modest themes of the show which both leave you feeling like you really understand the art of the dance and the craft of its dancers, and while most of these scenes can only come to life via the outstanding scripting as opposed to the raw visual flair with which other Production IG shows would arrest you with, the fact you’re feeling the inspiration stands firm, no matter how it worked its way into your heart. I suppose what I’m getting at here is Welcome to the Ballroom shouldn’t have been compared to likes of Haikyuu or Kuroko no Basuke to begin with, because while their production staff and animation team are the same, their content is not. Those anime and their tropic structures needed to be animated by the gods among men of Production IG to be worthwhile, and this one ultimately didn’t, even if the fact the lavishness in animation which they’ve made themselves famous for would’ve and very well could’ve made it so much more in motion than it was on paper.<br />

    Ballroom e Youkoso’s hype sank faster than 2-ton anchor. And it’s easy to see why. The show is plagued by lackluster animation and unlikeable characters. <br />
<br />
Ballroom’s biggest disappointment is the extreme lack of any actual dancing (or ballroom-styled music). Shows can survive dull characters and repetitive melodrama if they deliver something else worth sticking around for, but Ballroom failed on its biggest promise - to see some dancing. <br />
<br />
Instead of dancing, we get drawn stills and repetitive commentary from the audience about how great someone is or how much they improved or the differences between one dancing style and another, but never see any of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265404">
        it. And any dancing we do see looks more like chickens flapping around than anything graceful. <br />
<br />
The lack of any actual dancing also removes a good deal of tension from the show, a staple of sports anime. Instead of seeing action, we hear commentary on the action, breaking any chance of creating tension whatsoever. <br />
<br />
Bad animation isn’t the only reason behind the show’s lack of tension. While we’re watching our dancing stills and hearing people talk about them, we have very little clue about the sport itself. The points system, what judges are looking for, and any rules are only touched upon. <br />
<br />
The characters are as disappointing as the animation. When Tatara’s not complaining, he acts a sponge that exists to soak up other characters’ drama. In the first half of the season, he’s at least a boring-but-nice guy, but in the second cour, he spends most of this time failing to take action and complaining a lot. <br />
<br />
Oddly, Tatara is also the local psychologist - I guess. Not only is it weird that these characters (specifically, Shizuku and Mako) start blabbing their issues to someone they barely know, but they never actually talk to the person they’re having an issue with. The drama between these two girls and their dancing partners magically disappear without direct confrontation, which is not only confusing, but also misses on potential drama and character growth. <br />
<br />
The trend continues in the second half. Akira and Chinatsu get two episodes dedicated to their past history - but hardly interact with each other in the present. Instead, we get a clunky two-episode flashback from Akira’s point of view and jump back into the present without furthering Chinatsu’s and Akira’s relationship in any way whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Chinatsu is flat-out mean at times, and Tatara is flat-out pathetic. Their nonsense gets old after the first 10 episodes of the same thing over and over. On top of that, our supposed antagonist-rivals, Kugimiya and Akira, were made so sympathetic, that I don’t think I’ve ever wanted the leads to lose so badly before. <br />
<br />
I’d say the odd, creepy fanservice moments earlier on where we’re supposed to be entertained by a highschool girl getting peeped on and embarrassed by an older man is unnecessary. But this anime never had much going for it. <br />
<br />
Ballroom had so much promise. An anime about a visual sport? I was hoping for Yuri on Ice 2.0. By the end, I was hoping for anything remotely interesting to happen - including seeing a full dancing routine (crazy, right?). Instead, Ballroom provides little dancing, little tension, and lots of repetition and unlikeable characters.<br />

    Anime  Has often surprised me with the fact that how unpredictable it can really get. We often think to ourselves, that having watched so many shows, nothing can really surprise us anymore, But yet again, we are proved wrong with every new season. Take Fune wo amu for example, I never thought i  will watch an anime about dictionaries, And yet I found myself loving it more and more. And now we have Ballroom, An anime which explores the world of ballroom dancing, A sport which is perhaps is one of the most peculiar one out there , and perhaps  the most

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265357">
        elegant one too, And surprisingly makes it more interesting than you might really expect it to be.<br />
<br />
Sports anime have existed pretty much since the beginning of  the medium itself. From football to basketball, and even Shogi, We have seen almost all kind of games, And its not wrong to say that these anime, rather than the game, are now all about building the hype and adrenaline rush within the viewer, and keep them captivated.  Welcome to ballroom explores the world of ballroom dancing, which as a sport is not really that well known to many, But Rather than just being all about the game itself, Ballroom is somehow able to bring out the true beauty of Dancing, Not as a sport, But more as a form of art. It also gives the competitive vibe of the game as we would expect from any other sport anime.<br />
<br />
Now,When it comes to the story, Sports anime are not really known for their story lines. Of course we have seen sport  anime, with some pretty amazing storylines, But as mentioned before, Many of them are really all about sports, Which is not really a bad thing. Ballroom also offers little in this department, What we see is the generic run off the mill plot line that we we have really seen a hell lot of a times before. But, what really differentiates a good sport anime from other genre of anime, is that how it overcomes the lack of a proper story line , by offering the viewer something  more than that, That is , The real excitement of the game itself.<br />
<br />
The anime can be simply broken down into two parts here, The first one is more focused towards Tatara, The MC, as a a learner, who is slowly trying to grasp the concept of dancing . He is just a newbie who is learning , and is not someone you will refer to as a good dancer. The second half on the other hand is about how overcomes his weaknesses and learns more about himself . How he also tries to prove himself as a worthy dancer and  built his identity in this world of dancing.<br />
<br />
Characters, universally are known as the most important part of any anime , However, In such anime, their role is of much more importance than others. Ballroom shows The  conflicts, self doubt,excitement, and of course, the anxiety, that the Characters hide behind their smiling faces on the stage.<br />
<br />
 The main character Tatara, has been struggling to find his purpose in life, more than anyone, he wants to prove his talents to the world, but is confused about how to do so, And he finds His own way in this world of Dance. He still  is new to the world of dancing, and really has no special talent for doing it either. But he still works hard to become the very best and most of all, he is portrayed  a strong willed and determined person and  not as a wimp. However, It doesn&#039;t hide the fact that he is really just a generic character that we might have seen before . However, as mentioned before, it is the second half from where things change. Introduction of Chinatsu is The most important part of the second half, As she is not just the new partner of Tatara, But a person who completely changes him and also the world around him. She is much like a tomboy, who uses harsh words , but cares about Tatara more Than anyone else. She is an experienced dancer herself, But her inability to become a partner makes her really no different from Tatara, With is inexperience in leading. And This mismatched combo is perhaps The best part of the entire show itself<br />
<br />
Now, talking about characters, we should also see that the other characters are not overshadowed in any way, In fact they actually shine out the most in the first half of the show, quite literally. Both the girls, Mako and shizuka, have played important roles in the development of Tatara as dancer. They have both played as his partners and have been major part of the story. Sengoku san served as his mentor and have taught him everything he knows. These other characters do have played major roles, but just in support of Tatara, That is for the most part, and we do not really get to see a lot about them, But as said there presence is not overshadowed. In fact, one of my most favorite parts of the show was the Mako Tatara solo, in which Mako was the main presence and she quite literally shone beautifully  like a flower.<br />

Like other Sports anime, Ballroom also brings along with it , some in depth trivia and facts about the sport. It just shows us how watching people dance and actually being on the stage is completely different experiences.  .It also goes a bit deeper by showing us the psychological  battles that these people go through while on the stage, The anime shows how much does an actual person goes through when on a stage, The split second decisions and of course To maintain  The focus on the partner. But more than that, It shows the true happiness These people feel while on the stage. Honestly, The show does and excellent job of portraying all these complex feelings of these people, without being too forceful with it. <br />
<br />
Now when we talk about dance, music is something which naturally comes to our minds along with it, So as one would think in such anime music of course would play in important role. Now Both the Op are very good in my opinion, They tend to be fast paced and built the excitement within the viewer. The music played within the scenes, That is during the dance routines, is somewhat overshadowed, Now the anime is focused on dance, but music is as important, The anime uses different styles of music and effects for different  dance routines, however the music sometimes, just tends to get a bit overshadowed, which is not really good. Both the ED are also pretty fine, Tho second one is my favorite. <br />
<br />
The art, I guess, is just pretty average. The anime uses a bright color palette , Which fits quite well with the series, But there is really nothing special heer, That is , until the things get on the stage. The beautiful animations during the dance literally make the characters and music , come to life. The smooth movement, the Beautiful special effects just makes things even more beautiful. The character design is also pretty fine, but thins get real when they are on stage, The facial expressions they make are more than enough to convey their satisfaction and happiness. Overall, The art section is really well done .<br />
<br />
Now dance is something which we would expect to see in a sports anime, But don&#039;t let that fact deceive you, Because this show is nothing less than any other sport show out there. Its fast paced, beautifully animated and gets you excited and makes you wish for even more.   It is something  everyone should experience once. It shows something like dance, which we might not really think of often, in a way we would  never expect. It does have its flaws, however, in total, Its an enjoyable  ride, that everyone should try.

    Now that, is seriously an unexpected but a very pleasant surprise. Damn, that is something really lighting up! Dancing TV shows have really been a trend lately, but what I’ve just witnessed is something much more impressive. The anime is 100% about ballroom dancing exclusively.<br />
<br />
This is the very first anime series dedicated to professional ballroom dancing, if I’m correct, hell, that’s the first anime dedicated to dancing at all! There’s been lots of shows about all other kinds of sports like basketball, football, baseball, tennis, volleyball, swimming,… and tooons of others, and finally, FINALLY, we’ve got to ballroom dancing, which can’t make me anything but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255336">
        happy. <br />
<br />
You see, being a ballroom dancer myself for 15 years, I’m SUPER DUPPER OVERMYHEAD EXCITED seeing my favorite sport at last getting an anime adaptation, and though it’s only’ve been a couple episodes, but trust the expert, judging from what I saw – this is gonna be EPIC.<br />
<br />
The story is more than simple. A total newbie is been dragged into the world of dancing by some stranger who happens to be an expert and will teach our hero and bla-bla-bla… Now agree, that is mostly common plot thing to almost every sports anime, not to mention that our main character is making a tremendous progress since the very beginning of his trainings… aaand that’s all because he’s been charmed by a beautiful classmate girl who also happens to be into dancing (actually he was just stalking after her and that’s how it all happened, but that’s not a thing). The thing is that the creators have really made a COLOSSAL work by showing every single move of the dancers that we see, such detailed, every singe line and angle of their body as they stand prepared to waltz, every dynamic motion as they dance cha-cha, and every emotion on their faces – from serious and confident tango to romantic and sensual rumba.<br />
<br />
With that said, all I can tell about an art style is “FANTASTIC”. Though I’m not a fan of frequent usage of 3D in anime (more a fan of an old animating style), this one does deserve to be noticed and praised for its aliveness, vividness and multicolourness.<br />
<br />
The anime will amaze you with musical compositions – rhythmic and inflammatory – they will make you dance even sitting on a chair. From opening to ending – this is a trip to a wonderland that will drag you into an unrestrained yet splendid whirlpool of dance sports and you WILL beg for MORE. Not to mention flawlessly looking girls who will make your heart beat speed up twenty times faster;)<br />
<br />
The show is expected to be on the level of “Your Lie in April” that startled us with great characters, its own unique drawing style and a feeling of full immersion in deep waters of music; this is what you SHOULD look forward to from “Welcome to the Ballroom” series,… but about dancing.<br />

    I couldn&#039;t wait to start watching Ballroom e Youkoso, but it really missed the mark. While it has a lot of problem, I&#039;ll focus on two big ones: failure as a sports anime and a boring lead. <br />
<br />
I love sports anime. The drama. The tears. The tension. I love Ping Pong the Animation, Haikyuu!!, and the Yuri on ICE!!!. But Ballroom fails at a fundamental level when it comes to being a &quot;sports anime&quot;. <br />
<br />
First, almost none of dancing is actually animated, which is pretty surprising considering Production I.G. also brought us Haikyuu!!. Sure it&#039;s difficult to animate characters in motion, but YOI dedicated a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265405">
        lot of screen-time to skating routines (maybe even too much). When I started a ballroom dancing anime, I expected more than a few seconds of footwork every episode. Instead I got a bunch of stills with long-necked characters bearing frankly creepy smiles and long-winded narrations about why a character is dancing well or not. Later we also see weird metaphors that meant the anime lowered its budget or author went on a existential bender. Some of these ended up looking so silly that I laughed so hard I cried. <br />
<br />
Without clearly defined rules (like get the ball over the net) and with no visuals to help you out, the audience must rely wholly on narration to build tension, and it&#039;s pretty boring. There wasn&#039;t a single moment where I was holding my breath, waiting to see if our character would win. Even Kuroko No Basket (which I wasn&#039;t a huge fan of) built a lot of tension in games, as all sports anime should. The lack of rules and dancing animation sucked away the tension. Therefore Ballroom, as a sports anime, fails. <br />
<br />
But wait! Some sport anime, like Ballroom, are character focused, so the tension comes from the characters, right? Sure. I love Ping Pong The Animation. During the show&#039;s final match you don&#039;t even care who wins because the tension is invested in character&#039;s growth. Yuri on ICE!!! and Free! are also character-focused sport anime, but both build more tension than Ballroom.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
The characters are more developed and more interesting than Ballroom&#039;s cast. Fujita Tatara is about as interesting as a piece of wet toast. He whines about not being a good enough dancer for 24 episodes (basically the typical shounen plea of &quot;I need to get stronger). Tatara is on trend with &quot;nicer shounen leads&quot;, but he falls flat when compared to, say, Hinata from Haikyuu!! or Midoriya from Boku no Hero Academia. It would&#039;ve been less irritating if he another conflict he could&#039;ve overcome.<br />
<br />
While the side characters have potential, they get stuck talking to Tatara, which makes for lack lust conversations. Instead of seeing two characters with tension or conflict duke it out, both characters talk to Tatara about their problems, which results in disappointing resolutions to character conflicts. <br />
<br />
On top of all of this, there are some unnecessary fan service scenes and narrative issues that make this anime subpar. It can&#039;t hurt to watch if you like sports anime, but you&#039;re not missing anything special if you don&#039;t. Despite front-loading the first episodes with fan service, the first dvd didn&#039;t sell well, which doesn&#039;t surprise me.<br />
<br />
The last episodes made it terribly difficult to root for what I liked to call the &quot;limp noodle and wild mare pairing&quot; over the other pairings, who all proved more interesting and complex.<br />
<br />
The ending was so cheesy and predictable it could&#039;ve made a Disney character puke. But with little to no dancing animation, it was hard to judge the caliber of the dancers. This just proves the anime, at a fundamental level, failed. <br />
<br />
If you like dull leads, predictable plots, a cluster of shounen tropes, and long-winded dialogues about how good/bad someone is dancing, go for it. Otherwise, you aren&#039;t missing anything.

    Coming from Production IG who&#039;s track record we are all aware of, Ballroom e Youkoso is certainly a star in this packed summer 2017 season. <br />
<br />
This run of sport and athletic anime being produced is really a joy for me to see. The diversity and vast approach all of them are taking and the care they are putting into portraying these different sports, it&#039;s something wonderful to see. Ballroom e Youkoso is a part of this wondrous run. <br />
<br />
As far as the story goes, I am a little disappointed with regards to the setup. Fujita being a complete novice but yet holding some miraculous ability

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256981">
        that goes beyond reason, Hyodou being an absolute beast on the floor. This is something we have seen time and again, but the show is charming enough to compensate for this well trodden road. The addition of Hanaoka, who is talented in her own right, as Hyodou&#039;s partner and the focus of Fujita&#039;s fancies, and then Sengoku, former superstar who is now a teacher, it feels a bit like a mashup in ideas between Haikyuu and Yuri on Ice. They all work well together, especially considering the fact that the anime is about dance. <br />
<br />
Fujita&#039;s arc so far has been enjoyable, watching him and his growing desire to compete is quite admirable. His growth as a dancer is almost laughable but then there are moments where his internal brilliance shines through and you get caught off guard, just like the characters in the show. <br />
I also appreciate that even though Fujita is the MC, the other pairs and members of the dance studio play such an integral part in his development. They aren&#039;t exactly a team but function as some sort of strange family with rivalries and desires to get better. <br />
<br />
The animation of the show really sends it to the top in my honest opinion. The art exaggerates the postures and figures of everyone in the show, which makes the dancing feel that much more real. In real life, dancers are meant to be larger than life and this show captures that well. Everyone appears long, everything flows, it&#039;s all extremely dynamic, the steps are crisp and precise, the emotion shines through each movement. It really is a great example of how to animate an activity with such a range in movements, from little swings of the hip and sliding of the feet to leaps and quick steps in succession. <br />
<br />
As the season progresses, I am eager to see more of the dancing, how it evolves and how all the students can overcome their own personal dilemmas through their dance of choice.

    Sports shows sometimes are very hard to handle especially on the art and animation category. Some studio really pushed their limits just to achieve and match the sports for the sake of the overall production of the series. But don&#039;t you worry, Production I.G is back to save the day! before I conclude my review, let me discuss the show&#039;s fine points and noticeable flaws <br />
<br />
This really bothers me when I watched the very first episode. The similarities  between this show and Hajime no Ippo&#039;s pilot episode is insane. This is definitely interesting or rather annoying for other people but for me atleast, I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255366">
        still quite enjoy the 1st episode even though the execution isn&#039;t original. The overall plot is quite decent, I think the show doesn&#039;t really bother saving all of its full potential rather than making a risk and just blows everything up just to impress us the audience very early in the series. The show really excels on the general build up, giving us major informations that helps us to enjoy and understand the series. Though not all of them are given, there are times that you can&#039;t understand some of its given basic rules or even major guidelines for the competitions. Also I find the characters quite appealing, tho they&#039;re still not that very well fleshed out. But overall the show still really is trying hard to give us knowledge to understand the show fully. Btw, you know that one series that blew all of its animation budget for episode 1? and then as the show goes on, the quality melted? Ballroom e Youkoso wants to avoid that. ( &quot;Yes we were born to make history!&quot;~ ) <br />
<br />
I won&#039;t say much on the art because that&#039;s Production I.G for you. Stellar visuals, very detailed character designs, clean frames and great cinematography. I love the style and the details for the series but there is that one major problem that the series really can&#039;t avoid even for bigger studios like Production I.G, the lack of time for animating complicated performances. That&#039;s ballroom for you, very good to look at when it&#039;s animated perfectly but very hard to animate and it takes so much time. For now, I&#039;ve seen some dancing scenes that felt too short, for the most part it&#039;s just editing and a detailed keyframe. I&#039;ll definitely accept Production I.G rotoscoping real ballroom sequences rather than having them waste time on animating these from scratch. ( Tho, it is confirmed that I.G really don&#039;t rotoscope real movements, they&#039;re more likely to use them as reference.<br />
<br />
Overall, Ballroom e Youkoso is a good show, having such fascinating visuals and with an interesting premise really deserves to be one of the highlights of this season. But let&#039;s still wait and see if this show really deserves the praise. Do I recommend you to watch it? Definitely! Is it for everyone, probably. <br />

    &quot;Now that&#039;s what I call Sports Anime!&quot;  <br />
<br />
I cannot emphasize enough how wonderful this show was for me to watch. Until this past year I had not managed to enter the world of sports anime, and after devoting an entire season to exploring the genre in its various forms and series, I can definitively say that Ballroom e Youkoso (Welcome to the Ballroom) is one of my favorites and one of the most enjoyable by far. From basketball to rugby, ping pong to bicycle races, the realm of sports has all different kinds of appeal, however; Ballroom has something that is entirely unique to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265374">
        it: aesthetic. <br />
<br />
When I say this, I don&#039;t mean the art or animation--though I shall talk about that shortly. What I mean when I say aesthetic, is that the look of the competitors and exhibition of the dancing itself  is wholly important to the nature of the sport being examined here. Ballroom Dancing is a team (pair) sport about performing amazing physical feats and looking stunning while doing them with the utmost precision and technique. Though skeptical at first, I feel that this manga and subsequent anime adaption have done every thing in their power to show this to their audience. Though usually thought of as a activity for &quot;women, and old people with too much money and time on their hands,&quot; Ballroom manages to take every part of what makes an anime a &quot;sports&quot; anime and turn it into a show of beauty that appeals to a much wider audience than one may first think. <br />
<br />
Allow me to be the first to bring up last year&#039;s Yuri!!! On Ice, which disappoints severely in this regard. As a result of this past disappointment, I had a great deal misgivings about Ballroom and was worried that it would end on a less impressive note; however, after finding the manga at my local bookstore and deciding to pick it up and give it a perusal before the anime began, my fears were wiped away. What I got was beautiful illustrations, even development for the characters, and a story that didn&#039;t understate the work and effort and devotion they needed to be competitive dancers. Ballroom Dancing is a sport, this series wasn&#039;t going to let you forget that, and I love it all the more because of it.<br />
<br />
I have few points to bring up on the technical side of the series: <br />
<br />
Story: It&#039;s a tale as old as sports series about a boy who just wants something to give his life a little more meaning, finds his way into a dance school accidentally, and then finds himself exploring the world of a sport that he wouldn&#039;t have given a second glance at if not for the people he meets there. Now this is just how the story starts and as our leading boy Tatara explores the world of dance and struggles to find his dance we are treated to an interesting take on the typical beginner&#039;s story. Maybe nothing too flashy, but definitely nothing to sneeze at either.<br />
<br />
Art: People complain about the necks a lot, but this is dance and posture is consistently pointed out, so this is no doubt a creative choice on the part of the creators. The animation is lack luster at it&#039;s worst, and ASTOUNDING at it&#039;s best. While it would have been nice to have seen the animation be its best the entire time, very few seasonal anime manage to be as consistent, so some lee-way is there. Perfect? No, in fact it has a habit of letting you down too early in some crucial instances, but I believe it serves it&#039;s purpose more than well enough. You can follow the movements of the dancers almost always fluidly and that has to count for something.  <br />
<br />
Sound: A++ Points for Unison Square Garden for both openings and Sing Sing Sing as part of the soundtrack. I don&#039;t think anyone would complain about the sound. <br />
<br />
Characters: I found them to be unique and likeable. None of them were one-time friends or adversaries, and each of them had a story to tell and a role to play that would have changed the story entirely had they not been present. Some might find the protagonist a bit hard to be initially invested in, but time makes him grow on you, and until then the supporting cast is always fun. <br />
<br />
Overall, Welcome to the Ballroom is an exemplary show that incorporates the beauty of ballroom dancing with the intensity of sports anime while balancing a well-put-together cast and enjoyable story. While it may not be everyone&#039;s cup of tea, it is a very easy 24 episodes to recommend. I look forward to continuing to follow the manga and will be overjoyed should we ever get the honor of a future season of the anime.

    Sengoku saves the show for me , and that ball grabbing guy. My favorite scene in whole anime till now. Makes me remember about Gintama.<br />
<br />
Ok lets go. MC is a crybaby, no special born-gifted talent, no hardworking, screws up most of the time and is hard to understand. But other characters are logical reasonable and filled with awesomeness. Like Sengoku, like Kurusomething, like Sengoku partner, like Mako, like Gaju. But others i dont know they dont fit to those characters and art and music. İts like they are gathered from other shows. This is actually why i dont like this show that much. İ watched

          <span style="display: none;" id="review261777">
        it to see if anything catches me but i will leave it at 16th episode and if i see a score jump after this show is finished then i will start from where i leff.<br />
<br />
Music and Art is little brother of Haikyu, and story is not everywhere Haikyu. İts not about dance, i think its about when you present dancing with this art,music and great characters it makes dance look like an lady in his 50s tring to race with Usain Bolt or tring to block DeAndre Jordan.<br />
<br />
İ think thats all what i think about this show but hey i think its bad, its not horrible, if possible id like to give it 5,75 points. Oh well i didnt have that option. But i can say this is show is not best of summer 2017, anime doesnt have endless potential like a living human being can have and this anime is at least something you can spend your time if you are free. Lastly as a old sportsman i will leave this here, Sports are not good looking aesthetic part of art. From what i got while watching this anime is Dancing in general is best when it does look good not when you run like you are escaping from Godzilla or its not like you are shooting a beam to enemy tower. İts like &quot; Yeeey we look so nice and artistic.&quot; No. Sorry to all dancers but im not gonna accept dancing as a sports even if its in Olympics or whatever. This is why i didnt like story at all, it is presented wrong in my opinion, even on worldwide where all people accepts it. Would be better if this was just a Netorare hentai or a Romantic Drama like Scum&#039;s Wish which is the show i hate most.

    So when people say they can&#039;t escape sports anime hell they mean it! I can attest to that, Ballroom e Youkoso is a sports anime that hasn&#039;t been seen much of or at all really. The animation is great and seeing all the work that was put into this anime is amazing. I appreciate the crews hard work and the creator for making this. The characters are unique and sometimes you can get lost with what their goals are but that could just be lost in whether or not you&#039;re paying attention to the subtitles and show or just watching the images itself. The main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258614">
        character is relatable and offers so much potential to this anime. I am up to date with the manga and since this anime&#039;s release I have been excited to see it all animated and where it leads next. The music is nice and fits very well! I enjoy this anime because it keeps my attention and I can relate to it because who hasn&#039;t been like the main character at some point in their lives when they try something new and want to get better?

    Beautiful , Emotional ,Enjoyable and Brilliant ! From an anime that focuses on dancing i got more than i was expecting! A masterpiece!<br />
<br />
Welcome to the Ballroom is one of the candidates for anime of the year. At first i was wondering what an anime about social dancing could offer to me as a viewer who has no particular interest in these stuff. I got myself into a fantastic show who knows how to built up the tension in each episode and release it on the dance floor, in a beautiful display of the characters thoughts and feelings during their dance and finally i got some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265353">
        knowledge  about the dancing world. Let&#039;s not forget the enjoyment after finishing each episode that leaft a great taste in my mouth. If you are hesistant to watch it because of that trust me it&#039;s worth your time and it will exceed your expectations. <br />
<br />
The story is layered in two acts and follows the development of our main character Tatara as he venture into the world of dancing.  He discovers and experience new stuff and emotions that break his ordinary world and make him step up his game. The focus is not only on Tatara, the story has more  to offer  such as competitions, rivals, different styles and genres of dancing(quickstep, waltz ) ,the effort and time spend on mastering your own style as a dancer, what it needs for a dancing pair/couple to work as one, leader/follower in a pair  and finally how all these things influence the lives of the characters as dancers. Amazing!<br />
<br />
The characters are great and the funny interactions between them manages to make them easier to be understood by the viewers. They develop and shine on the dance floor were each dance gives you a bump of adrenaline. What it&#039;s impressive in this anime is how they manage to connect its audience to the mindset, emotions and tensed atmosphere that our characters feel on the dance floor. <br />
<br />
The visuals and great music play an important role throughout this series and manage to make an ordinary dance from boring to brilliant  and make the dancers bloom like a beautiful flower on the dance floor.<br />
If i may complain of something about this show that would be the first episodes who are kinda slow but even this can&#039;t ruin my overall enjoyment and impression. Just watch it is damn awesome!

    I wasn&#039;t expecting to ever write a review but after watching this anime I couldn&#039;t not do it! Ballroom e youkoso really surprised me, at first i thought &quot;an anime about dancing? How good can that be?&quot; but i soon realized how wrong i was.<br />
Now the synopsis of this story is kinda basic for a sports anime but the execution is done in a exceptional way! I love all the emotion that the characters bring out and the fusion between that, the music and the animation is really something else! The characters are really fun and to me they seem like normal people with good

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417993">
        and bad traits. The art is gorgeous (although at first i was a bit alarmed by the long necks but i got past that really quick). <br />
For those who don&#039;t know, the animation is the same as Haikyuu! a well known volleyball anime so if you love that you probably are gonna like Ballroom e youkoso as well. This anime kept me at the edge of my seat and the adrenaline it gave me was crazy, i would never imagine an anime about dancing to &quot;shake me up&quot; like that. I couldn&#039;t wait to watch the next episode. I&#039;m really glad that i got to watch this the ending for me was super emotional and cute, i wish we had a season 2 but you can also read the manga to find out what happens next! I hope this review got you to watch and enjoy Ballroom e youkoso! &lt;3<br />
<br />
P.S: I want to point out that this anime for me is a 10/10 but for typical reasons i gave it a 9/10. This is also my first review so keep that in mind.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day!

    May contain slight spoilers...<br />
<br />
For an anime that’s entire focus is dancing, I’m a little disappointed in some of the dance scenes I found in Welcome to the Ballroom. Why, you may ask? Well, if I had to sum up my issues with the show, I’d probably blame them on the show’s budget. Of course, it wasn’t all bad as I thoroughly enjoyed the characters that I met in this 2 cour anime, and the drama and comedy kept me watching for more, but I just couldn’t shake the problems I kept picking up on.<br />
<br />
First of all, let’s start with the good points. The characters are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265391">
        all lovely and most of them get their own special moment in the spotlight. We either watch them dance their hearts out or peer into their backstories that are filled with all the hardships that they endured to become the athletes they are today. Their interactions with each other are also hilarious, as dancers competing in their pairs are forced to try and somewhat get along, allowing some funny or gripping moments between the cast.<br />
<br />
Each of their differing personalities clashes with each other, from an enthusiastic newbie that learns differently from others, the professionals that practice endlessly to maintain their status and a female dancer that would rather act as the male lead role in the couple. The more you progress into the show, the more you learn about a certain someone as they continue to grow in experience and skill. Add in rivals and silly facial reactions and it becomes a joy to watch their antics as they either try to teach the new kid to dance the basics or look away when one of them is being subjected to some painful joint stretches. You can’t help but have fun watching the cast training to perfect their dance routines or enjoying their lives as school students.<br />
<br />
Of course, these same elements are used to create drama as well, with a sibling couple separating cause they can’t seem to reach their full potential together or an old-fashioned dancer trying to make a comeback after being out of the game for awhile. You can’t be the best in anything if you don’t overcome obstacles, and the show knows how to create situations for our characters so they can rise up to the challenge. The mix of laughter and tears accumulate into a story that just draws you into their world of professional ballroom dancing as they enter tournament after tournament to show off their style to everyone around them.<br />
<br />
Now the main issue I have with the show, the actual dancing. Due to it being an animated show locked under money constraints, it’s forced to use way too many stills and transitions to try and make it’s dancing scenes barely “passable”. If may work for other anime to do something like this, but for a sport that solely relies on body movement to entertain its audience, a lot of the time there is not enough actual movement.<br />
<br />
What’s even worse is all the dialogue that should just be going on in the background becomes the focus as the camera is forced from the characters dancing to someone in the audience commenting on what’s happening. Instead of being an anime about dancing, it seems to turn into an anime about people talking about dancing a few too many times.<br />
<br />
The music for some tournaments also needs to be improved, as there are a quite a few scenes where the songs in the first half don’t exactly match the dancing. Dancing and music go hand in hand, so to mess up something as important as this, along with every other issue mentioned, it’s gonna lower the enjoyment of the show quite significantly. It might be better to just read the manga where it’s already still/quiet so you won&#039;t have to sit through the anime&#039;s problems or wait for a movie that has more time and cash to actually put in the effort needed to make the show look good.<br />
<br />
Even with the frequently lacklustre dance animation, Welcome to the Ballroom was still a joy to watch each week. The characters and story kept me from hating the show, keeping my score and view of the show decently high. Of course, there may be people that can’t forgive an anime for being unable to properly portray its main focus, so some might see the manga as best option if you still wanna try the series. If I had to choose between calling this show a good or bad experience, I would have to say it was pretty good, so at least try it out for yourself. Anime or manga, whichever one you decide, just let yourself get dragged into their story.

    Till Episode 10 -   Very good. Good character development and overall enjoyment is excellent.  All the ladies and men are respected and given equal importance. Story line keeps you engaged and total satisfaction is provided. <br />
<br />
From Episode 11 - New girl enters the anime with good prospects. It turns out our guy is a wimpy useless liberal left feminist douche! And the new girl is more manly with good bully future. I don&#039;t know if the director changed or the writer but the anime goes from good entertaining watchable to stinky irritating feminist  propaganda.<br />
  <br />
 I would suggest everyone to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265476">
        see till epi. 10 then create your own imaginations for the rest.

    (This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)<br />
<br />
For as long as I have known my older sister, she has been a dancer through and through.<br />
<br />
Everywhere has counted: at the school talent show, at her local studio, at numerous recitals, at different states. Everything has counted as well: tap, ballet, hip-hop, Latin. Across her entire leg-driven journey, she has claimed enough awards and cheers and experience to last a lifetime.<br />
<br />
Basically, she has seen and partaken in nearly all that dance has to offer. Despite her dancing expertise, though, I have yet to hear any mention of ballrooms. And after watching the entirety of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295375">
        Ballroom e Youkoso, I can confidently say, as someone with zero dance moves whatsoever, she is seriously missing out.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
The world of competitive ballroom dancing may not exactly be on the forefront of everyone’s mind. It exists within that niche corner given its lack of truly intense traits and low popularity. It tends to also be a very difficult sport to get into, demanding countless hours of repeating the same basic techniques and requiring certain physical builds to succeed. And its set of unfair stigmas potentially turn people away from the get-go before they even give it a fair chance.<br />
<br />
Ballroom e Youkoso faces such negativity head up and foot forward without ever losing a beat.<br />
<br />
True to its premise, the anime understandably makes it a priority to explain what goes on within ballroom dancing for the uninitiated (which, again, is most likely a majority). The dances themselves – the waltz, the quickstep, the tango – are paramount, so the differences, the nuances, and the moves between them become a focal point. Tons of smaller details about the league, the scoring, the ranks, the gender ratios, and the types also pop up to further flesh out the formation of the sport and thus the show itself.<br />
<br />
The anime is not just content with explaining itself; Ballroom e Youkoso also demonstrates what makes ballroom dancing worthwhile to begin with. It does so with a passionate edge, a look-see into the minds of the dancers themselves. In doing so, the show grants itself a cooler, fuller picture of its scenes beyond just watching a bunch of people twirl and step about.<br />
<br />
For instance, ballroom dancing posits that mutual chemistry between two people causes a better understanding of one’s self as adaptation and sympathy take hold. Moreover, it demonstrates a willingness and a purpose on behalf of the dancers, for they choose this sport not for direct confrontation but instead as a want and as a desire to prove their capabilities to the masses. And the sport simply brings fun and happiness as synchronized steps form rapturous emotion for the dancers, the judges, and the audience at large.<br />
<br />
Looking into Ballroom e Youkoso on a narrative level, it showcases a solid-enough plot as the practices, the tournaments, and the conflicts naturally arise. Furthermore, themes on self-worth and numerous engaging moments affix an appropriate amount of drama. It could be argued that the competitions tend to stretch out too long at times, but the intermittent hype of the dances and those introspective thoughts of the characters yield the right amount of variety to keep these stretches manageable.<br />
<br />
The anime does not earn full marks in every round, though. The occasional sexual content is not totally out of place when considering the sensuality of dancing itself and the attractive people who believe this sport to be their calling. Akira commenting on Chinatsu’s extreme beauty or Chinatsu in turn teasing Akira for her extra curves do not cross over into weird territory.<br />
<br />
However, the infrequent “jokes” related to accidents, sizes, and masculinity can cross the line, clashing too much with the seriousness of the drama and leaning too far outside of the lighthearted direction of the comedy overall.<br />
<br />
Besides this problem, some of the writing and the dialogue can come off as antiquated due to the terminology surrounding the male-and-female duos. But this awkwardness deals more so with the culture of the sport and treads into nitpicking territory since the ladies are themselves a powerful bunch anyway.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, the setup, the purpose, and the structure of the story allow positivity to reign supreme within this dancing spectacle.<br />
<br />
ART &amp; ANIMATION<br />
<br />
On the visual side, Ballroom e Youkoso continues its strong stride.<br />
<br />
The character designs start things off right. Nice line work and facial details in general increase the accuracy of their depictions and therefore give greater definition to their expressions. Their casual garb versus their competitive attire – especially for how much handsomer and prettier the men and women respectively jump – makes for a lovely contrast, too. Even their overly long necks (giraffes or no) contribute an elegance and a fragility which further emphasizes the impact of their dances.<br />
<br />
To be fair, the audience must suspend some disbelief that these near-pro-yet-still amateurs are at the tail-end of middle school despite looking like college kids or outright adults. Nevertheless, their slender frames once again bolster the ballroom motif, and their different builds even become a factor in the character writing itself.<br />
<br />
Not so right is Ballroom e Youkoso’s penchant for reusing past moments or segments to a noticeable degree. Tatara’s ginormous smile as he comes into frame comes to mind. While not a deal-breaker (since it is unrealistic to expect an absolute, constant upkeep of new depictions), it leaves the show for want of stronger artistic appeal.<br />
<br />
It combats against this detriment with interspersed scenes filled with style and creativeness. Kiyoharu and Shizuku turn on fire at one point as their dancing heats up, and Tatara and Chinatsu break down doors together amidst their foggy consciousness. Whatever the case may be, these scenes up the intrigue and the fascination of the presentation, giving Ballroom e Youkoso another leg to stand on as its vital events commence.<br />
<br />
This anime deserves some extra credit, too. Animating and articulating the complexities of dancers, both on their own and in unison, is by no means an easy feat. And, despite the troubles outlined above, the dancing depicted almost never took on any outright mistakes or notable hiccups. Rather, Ballroom e Youkoso took many a creative liberty with perspectives and proportions to up the ante.<br />
<br />
Yes, the back bending could be slightly less obtuse, but this exaggeration furthers the finesse this sport demands. A praiseworthy stride no doubt.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
While Ballroom e Youkoso does well on both a story and artistic front, the characters make a claim for the strongest part of the entire show.<br />
<br />
It all centers on Tatara, the main protagonist of this dancing tale. Without much in the way of prospects, his humble beginnings make him a prime candidate for everlasting change. He has no experience whatsoever in this field, and he only joins the studio after watching the entrancing footage which Sengoku-san, the best ballroom dancer in the world, lent to him.<br />
<br />
As such, Tatara’s journey is far from an immediate rise to the top. He has sharp eyes that let him absorb information by studying those around him, and he has a keen knack for dance in general, but he begins at the bottom like any other jelly-legged nobody. Stamina issues, confidence issues. The anime makes it clear that Tatara is a bright young man with a good heart yet still needing all the help he can get.<br />
<br />
That’s where the supporting cast members arrive. Ballroom dancing is a paired sport, so the people around Tatara offer their aid either directly or indirectly through mentoring, coaching, or battling. For instance, Shizuku will offer advice or encouragement from the sidelines, or Mako, with her own low self-esteem, will lean on him in her own time of need to challenge his perception.<br />
<br />
Then similarly, Tatara sees Sengoku-san and Kiyoharu as companions-in-arms (or rather legs) that inspire him. Sengoku-san represents his role model as he strives to be like him while also realizing how vastly inferior he is skill-wise. As for Kiyoharu, he wishes to compete alongside him someday soon, for they see in each other the same knack of passion and of potential.<br />
<br />
Truth be told, these side characters do not normally have the largest depth given the small amount of background exploration and the quickness of its delivery. But again, they exist mostly to compare and contrast with Tatara and show his strong points, his weak points, and everything in-between. Plus, Mako, Kiyoharu, and others still either receive their own time to shine or otherwise have portions of episodes dedicated to their past experiences and subsequent upbringing. That’s more than enough for their supportive roles throughout the series.<br />
<br />
What they and Tatara cannot fix, however, is his lacking foundation. In other words, Tatara’s motivations and personal conflicts stem from a rather nonexistent place. His desire to change and to kickstart his static path is flimsy at best, and his background, home life, and general non-dance life is hardly (if ever) explored outright. So, while the path he takes develops him well, his core character never truly emerges.<br />
<br />
To combat this problem, Ballroom e Youkoso doubles down on Tatara’s character growth in the back half of the season. It does so not with its standard approach but instead by introducing into the fray a newcomer and, perhaps surprisingly, the second-most important person in the show: Chinatsu.<br />
<br />
Chinatsu puts up a tough personality, dislikes dance, and maintains a lot of experience. Basically, she is the complete opposite of Tatara – naturally making her the perfect partner for him and him for her. They therefore don’t quite get along (at first anyway), but they need each other more so than they realize. If for nothing else than to discover the “other side” of sorts.<br />
<br />
These sides capture what they each fail to do. Tatara cannot lead; Chinatsu cannot follow. By mirroring their individual yet interlinked struggles in this manner, the show marks their bond as a stellar point of the series. They test and practice, fight and compromise. All in the name of leaving everything on the dance floor.<br />
<br />
As this dichotomy plays out, he finally discovers the magic in his footing thanks to her uncompromising will, and she finally learns to trust others thanks to his unflinching determination. Thus, she goes from leading to following, and he goes from following to leading. Such a reversal in roles makes for an awesome dual character arc that they share together in splendid fashion.<br />
<br />
Simultaneously, more supporting characters arrive during this home stretch, too. Akira and her relationship with Chinatsu. Kugimiya and his internal frustrations. Once again, Ballroom e Youkoso enlists the help of these extras who both affect the mains in a worthwhile way and receive at least a modicum of attention to give their presence more than a passing stance.<br />
<br />
By the end of this two-cour season, Tatara, Chinatsu, and a host of other characters form a stalwart cast who not only contribute to the well-being of one another but also charge ahead with advancements of their own. They don’t reach that top-tier spot, but strong execution in the writing can be seen readily enough.<br />
<br />
MUSIC &amp; SOUND<br />
<br />
Speaking of leading and following, Ballroom e Youkoso leads with several nice musical pieces and follows with some swell audio decisions as well.<br />
<br />
The show kicks it off with its first opening track, “10% roll, 10% romance”. The rhythmic drums and the upbeat guitar build the foundation for this peppy song, and the lighter vocals form the mood equally as light. Better yet, the step-wise delivery and the multitude of pacing switch-ups coincide with that all-encompassing dancing motif, placing this OP into good graces.<br />
<br />
Come the second half of the anime, the second opening track, “Invisible Sensation”, replaces the first one. While it returns with a similar sense of instrumentation and singing, this new OP takes on a slightly different tone. A twinge of both passion and melancholy now exist in the composition as the hopeful arrangement carries on. While this track is somewhat of a downgrade, the nuanced shift in the overall feeling, to reflect the remainder of the season upon its arrival, can at least be appreciated.<br />
<br />
“Maybe the next waltz” isn’t a statement but instead the title of the first ending track. Compared to its two OP counterparts, this piece invites the listener with gentleness aplenty. Piano keys and string instruments provide an orchestral base for a grander sound, but the chimes and general daintiness keep the song in check as its fantastical aura moves about softly on the ears. The main vocals dance along, the backing vocals uplift the track, and, in unison, they round out the rest of this unassuming melody.<br />
<br />
As for the second ED, “Swing heart direction” combines a bit of each of the three songs heard already while carving out its own piece of the dance pie. Drums and guitar accompany a piano, working together and on their own, towards a sincere yet mellow angle. It doesn’t quite dazzle as much as the other tracks, but its simplicity and (as it denotes) heart fill the song with a steady amount of emotion.<br />
<br />
Ballroom e Youkoso also creates a bunch of sweet pieces for its original soundtrack in-between these OPs and these EDs. Dramatic tunes of violins and of pianos add the necessary weight to the more powerful moments, such as when Shizuku talks to Tatara about how he (and others) have already left an impression on her. A defined acoustic-guitar gets at a tensioned, almost sexy atmosphere when required. And hip-hop beats with a nearby saxophone push scenes along with a smooth, jazzy hand.<br />
<br />
This diverse and intriguing OST is perhaps the best trait from the music-and-sound department, but the remaining elements deserve at least a shout-out, too. The anime demonstrates attention to detail with the squeaking of shoes on wooden flooring and, while the voice acting may not exactly enrapture, the ensemble cast provide very solid performances.<br />
<br />
At the minimum, Chinatsu Akasaki as (coincidentally enough) Chinatsu displays a directness and a range of emotion that elevates the red-head above her peers. Alongside the strength of the audio direction overall, Ballroom e Youkoso caps off its production values with a lot of clout, indeed.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
Slap on me a bowtie and nickname me “Tango” because I was a fan of this anime the whole way through.<br />
<br />
The gentlemen brought a lot. Tatara is an earnest fellow, and I like seeing him face his position with realism and guts. Gaju is at first a jerk, but he turns into a cool friend. And Kiyoharu is the quiet star, yet his wisdom and advice are honest and true. Each of the main ladies were a treat, too. Shizuku’s alluring, thoughtful intimidation. Mako’s tiny, cute smile. Chinatsu’s tomboyish, fiery passion.<br />
<br />
These characters are a ton of fun, and their rivalries and interactions translated into entertainment galore. I found myself rooting for and cheering on Tatara and Mako as their combined efforts led them to sincere happiness, and I invested emotions into Tatara and Chinatsu as they fought with everything they had.<br />
<br />
Plus, as someone without much interest in ballroom dancing, it kept me hooked. This sport is not technically a marvel, and I’m certainly no expert in that field. Meaning, I’m aware of its existence but I place myself in that group I described way earlier who truthfully cannot say it has landed on my radar in the past. Yet I’m always open to trying out stories or premises that don’t automatically fall into my favorite categories, and so I was pleasantly surprised that it basically never lost its luster and kept me engaged throughout its whole run.<br />
<br />
And I cannot forget to mention the other likable parts of this anime. The blonde Russian bombshell Marisa and the attractive Chizuru. The slight sparks of romance. The hilarious comedic segments throughout. Even if these parts weren’t here within this anime, I would still be singing its praises – or, more relevantly, attempting a jig in its honor.<br />
<br />
Ballroom e Youkoso impresses the judges and wows the onlookers with its moves. The audiovisual elements grab some attention, but the worthwhile setup, the strong character writing, and the huge amount of entertainment glide this project towards the front of the line. While not going everywhere or doing everything, it wins out regardless.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Good, ballroom dancing takes center stage, delivering a stout introduction to the sport and the benefits it brings, while also putting together a solid, exciting plot despite the occasional tactless “joke”<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation: Good, wonderful designs, intriguing stylistic moments, and, for the complex dance numbers, both an avoidance of major mistakes and lots of creative liberties overcome some of the issues with reused segments<br />
<br />
Characters: Good, despite the weak motivations backing the core of Tatara’s person, his growth throughout the season is reasonable and meaningful, his pairing with Chinatsu is stellar, and side cast members such as Mako and Kugimiya both support and improve<br />
<br />
Music &amp; Sound: Good, a collection of interesting OPs and EDs, a diverse OST, and some solid VA performances put the audio on the correct footing<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Great, waltzed right in and quickly became fun as it tangoed without end<br />
<br />
Final Score: 8/10

    Hajime Shokugeki no Kuroko&#039;s Ballroom e Ippo no Haikyuu could&#039;ve been a much more enjoyable anime if not for two major character mistakes:  <br />
<br />
1. They all but removed Sengoku from the series in the second season.<br />
2. They introduced Chinatsu who I did not like at all.  <br />
<br />
Sengoku was by far the best character in the entire anime, yet, without spoiling things, they completely removed his character for half of the anime.  He was the source of the humor and energy for the entire anime, and they cut him out.  Big mistake.  <br />
<br />
But the biggest mistake was the introduction of Chinatsu,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284994">
        who, for me, was a supremely unlikeable character, on the order of Sakura from Naruto.  Needlessly moody, obstinate and not at all charming as a Tsundere.  (SLIGHT SPOILER) And it was doubly irritating considering that the clear move and best pairing for Tatara was Mako.  I shipped Mako and Tatara hard, but instead, we get this irritating woman coming out of nowhere. <br />
<br />
This really killed the anime for me.  I really just lost interest and only completed it now because I had a couple of episodes left and I figured: &quot;Meh, why not finish it?&quot;.  <br />
<br />
As you can tell from my intro, this anime is just another Shoukugeki No Soma, Kuroko No Basket, Hajime No Ippo or Haikyuu.  Instead of sports or food, it&#039;s ballroom dancing, which was a weird choice.  But, it&#039;s exactly the same in that a savant takes on a competitive field of individuals and overcomes the odds, while people in the stands pretty much narrate the story for you.  Nothing groundbreaking or original in terms of plot. <br />
<br />
I will say the animation was striking for its unusual style.  Although, the dance moves weren&#039;t that well animated, in my opinion.  It was more just zooming in on character&#039;s over exaggerated faces while the background moved behind them. Or they would be frozen in place while the camera panned their bodies.  The actual movements weren&#039;t very well animated.  I give them a break on it, however, because animating dancing seems to be hard for everyone to do.  I think that&#039;s why there aren&#039;t more anime revolving around dancing.  But, besides that, the character design was interesting, especially the ostrich necks.    <br />
<br />
To be honest, I really liked the anime&#039;s first season when the goal seemed to be catching up to Kiyoharu and Shizuku, Sengoku was the Sensei and Mako was the partner.  But, once that all changed in the second season, and become more about Tatara learning how to deal with a irritant like Chinatsu, the anime lost its magic.  <br />

    The anime had the potential to get under your skin. The mixture of comedy, drama, school and ballroom dancing tournaments could be an exciting sports show. In fact, I had hoped for the same spirit as in &quot;Chihayafuru&quot;. Unfortunately the show could not meet my expectations. Let me explain why, maybe you have a different opinion and be able to enjoy Ballroom e Yōkoso. <br />
<br />
Story: Good storytelling, dynamic &amp; realistic. Second half, unfortunately unsuitable shift (05/10)<br />
The first episodes have excellent and realistic dynamics. The narrative style, the simple comedy and the portrayal of the characters go well together and create a coherent overall picture. We

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354447">
        get to know Tatara, a middle school student who has no goal in life so far, but accidentally comes across ballroom dancing. The first half beautifully tells the story of a boy whose life has been fundamentally changed by competitive dancing. Those who know the real film &quot;Strictly Ballroom by Baz Luhrmann [AU; 1992]&quot; will perceive part of the content as reflection. The often recurring theme in sports or martial arts shounen anime: recognize your abilities, train hard and develop your distinctive character and personality, is very well implemented. Personally, I find it very exciting that the different characters are portrayed on their personal level within the process. The theme in the second half is very different. In contrast to the manga, which actually touches on the same topic &quot;lead and follow&quot;, the adaptation seems less playful. In the anime, it seems more mature and almost gives the impression that the discrepancy between the old-fashioned rules of ballroom dancing and the role of the modern woman in society is the focus of attention. In principle, the topic is very interesting against the background of the current &quot;gender&quot; discussions, but this was not intended in the original. Unfortunately, this error affects all elements of the anime and is even amplified by subsequent flaws. I will discuss this aspect for each element in more detail, but an example for understanding in advance. During editing, various scenes are shortened. A scene that was only childish and defiant in the manga will be expressed much more strictly if a part of the scene is left out. A scene like this seems more ultimate, with no alternatives, like the decision of an adult. Such a shift in tonality is out of place for the target group that is actually desired. Put simply, one could say that the fundamental criticism of the whole anime is that it is neither fish nor fowl.<br />
<br />
characters: Cast suitable at first, but then sadly the focus gets lost (6/10)<br />
In anime very different characters are offered. The personalities initially match the target group, but this changes increasingly and reaches its peak from the second half. Again, the basic criticism is either shounen/shoujo or seinen/josei. You don&#039;t have to be a rocket scientist to see the change, but it does disturb the fun of the series, especially since it was not made very cleverly. Personally, it makes me very sad to give the cast such a low rating, especially because the separation of the personalities between competition and everyday life was presented so astonishingly well. Unfortunately, this is only one aspect that cannot improve the overall rating for this topic.<br />
Fujita, Tatara:<br />
He is the MC and in the beginning rather a weak teenager, whose submissive attitude almost demands a correction. But first the exact opposite happens, he is harassed by his classmates. Tatara seems to have come to terms with the fact that no one cares what happens to him. When suddenly a motorcyclist intervenes in the scene.  <br />
Sengoku, Kaname:<br />
He seems to be a perfect anachronism in society, tall, an even bigger ego, blond, rides a huge motorcycle and doesn&#039;t mince his words. In this respect a successful father figure, and even if he should have been a thorn in someone&#039;s side, reducing his presence was not a successful move. No matter how eccentric, strange or glamorous the cast was, without him the corresponding counterpart is basically missing.<br />
Hanaoka, Shizuku:<br />
She is my favorite female character, maybe because she reminds me of my own dance partner. This does not apply to her outer appearance, but to her inner conflict. She is a really good dancer, but unsure if she is the right one for the dance genius Kiyoharu. Not her dance partners doubt her, but she doubts herself. The answer she has to find for herself is a very real question, which is part of the tension throughout the whole series. I like her character, she has the power to prove herself through her skills and shines with an enchanting female aura, even if the rules are not to her advantage.<br />
Hyoudou, Kiyoharu:<br />
His character is really fascinating because the difference in his demeanour is so striking. On the one hand the passionate dancer and in everyday life an almost phlegmatic teenager. His knowledge about dancing is enormous and he also knows how to analyze dancers. The analysis of dancers is often used in anime, which is a clear indication of the serious mistake that the anime explains too much with words, what should actually be explained by moving pictures. So to speak Animation, which I will cover in more detail later. <br />
Akagi, Mako:<br />
Charming, very feminine but also insecure. Her shy nature needs an appreciative person, who gives her space and the possibility to recognize herself as valuable. The support in recognizing and realizing her own goals is the key here. Watching her grow is an enchanting arc.<br />
Akagi, Gaju:<br />
Oh boy, just calling him passionate doesn&#039;t quite hit the nail on the head. He is exactly the opposite to his younger sister Mako. He is straightforward and extremely demanding, to put it simply, a hothead. Unfortunately, this extreme stifles any tender attempts by his sister to develop further. However, Gaju is no fool. What I appreciate about him is that he recognizes the opportunity to develop himself, because of the change of another person.<br />
Hiyama, Chinatsu:<br />
The differences in the transformation of the manga into an anime are most evident in her character. Chinatsu is introduced in a similar way, but in manga the presentation is much more focused on the target group of teenagers (see Ch.18 Meeting). In the anime, unfortunately, this sequence has been reduced to simple phrases consisting of a lie and an unnecessary insult. Please don&#039;t get me wrong, from the manga I knew what would happen. This scene as simple teasing in the classroom would have been much more appropriate if another student had interfered as in the original. Basically it&#039;s not Chinatsu&#039;s fault that she appears like an adult and very condescending. This is also the main point of criticism for the implementation of the entire cast. In the second half, the young people had to deal with a socially critical topic, but retained the typical fears, questions and behavioral patterns of teenagers, yet the portrayal of their outer appearance seemed much more mature, causing confusion in the audience. To add insult to injury, the view from the women&#039;s perspective is only presented in thoughts or suggestions. As mentioned above, the focus is not properly aligned with the characteristics of the target audience. This is also the main reason why the rating of the cast is so low, although it is actually a very funny group. The socio-critical theme would certainly have been much more amusing between the sophisticated Ms. Hyoudou and the dominant Sengoku-san.<br />
Kugimiya, Masami:<br />
He was introduced into the plot with background and could be a suitable antagonist for Tatara. Unfortunately these roles were built up too hesitantly to really get into the game. Still, even though many people dislike his character, I enjoyed the fact that he gets a development as well. Indeed, considering his life story, his development is the most valuable gain.<br />
The cast still has interesting characters to offer, like Hongou, Chizuru or Koumoto, Akira, but I want to leave it up to you to discover them.<br />
<br />
Visuals: uncommon approach to Art, but very negative is the lack of animated dance sequences (4/10)<br />
4 out of 10 is a rather bitter pill, especially since it is obvious that the visual department has put a lot of effort into visualization. However, no mistakes or compromises should be made in the visual implementation, as this is the linchpin of an anime about ballroom dancing.<br />
In the field of art, the implementation of characters, clothing and the environment was successful. The adaptation largely corresponds to the original, which is a plus in my opinion. However, the character design in the manga is a bit softer overall and this more youthful look of the characters suits the target group better than the anime adaptation. With mixed feelings, I perceived the extreme representation of the effort, strain and stress that competition dancers go through. At first glance, some of the pictures with the sometimes grotesque facial distortions and unnatural looking poses, drawn with sketchy lines, seem rather unsuitable for elegant dance. However, taking into account that these exaggerated elements very accurately reflect the expression of emotions during a ballroom dance tournament, this should not be viewed as a devaluation. Having that said, the somewhat confusing aftertaste remains that the characters in the anime appear more mature because of their appearance than their actual age suggests. Except for Tatara, who always looks like a deer in the headlights. This mistake runs like a common thread through the anime.<br />
Nonetheless, the real flaw is not in the field of art, but in animation. In short, the lack of dynamic movement. The couple dances are the basic part of the anime. It is a grave mistake not to visualize long choreographed sequences and leave the explanations to the audience. Movement, especially in this elegant sport, should not be represented with speedlines or still images in which only the robes move. In addition, many expressive moments are shown with panning stills. This is the style the manga uses, and it does it very well, but so much more would be possible in the adaption, but that potential remains untouched. The viewer is forced to learn from the discussion fragments of the audience about the successes of the dancers, including Tatara&#039;s and how the dances are rated. The competitors on the dance floor are often CG-Dancers, none of that would be so annoying if it was an older anime. But Ballroom e youkoso was released in the same year, like Violet Evergarden for example. For an anime in this particular sports field that puts a lot of emphasis on aesthetics, the lack of animation for genre fans could be very annoying. Especially since there is a strong imbalance between the lack of enchanting, well-animated dance sequences, but instead it was possible to animate an exaggerated, melodramatic birth of a dance partner from Tatara&#039;s chest in episode 23. <br />
<br />
Sounds: Several beautiful pieces of music, followed by less good audio decisions. VA: nice (5/10)<br />
The background music was composed by Hayashi, Yūki, whose excellent music arrangements are also featured in anime such as Blood Lad, My Hero Academia or Death Parade. Ballroom e Yōkoso also has beautiful music for example &quot;Mattaritosita Nichijyou&quot;, which was affectionately intoned in classical style with orchestra, piano and flute or &quot;Partner Kessei (Ver. 2)&quot; to give another very nice example. One might ask, why is my rating for the sound department so low when music, voice acting and sound effects are basically good? It&#039;s not the size of the boat, it&#039;s the motion in the ocean. The best sound is not convincing if not staged correctly. Many scenes and especially in the few competitions have sound effects, the rustling of the clothes or the footsteps, but the music is missing. Basically, it&#039;s a very good technique to add depth to a scene by leaving out music, speech or even any sound. But this is about ballroom dancing and that effect just doesn&#039;t work here. In real life, all dancers would inevitably stop and ask what&#039;s going on. On the other hand, adding more depth is not necessary either. The visual department has already created strong stimuli due to the very stretched proportions. Even more emphasis on expression is simply too much of a good thing.<br />
Anyway, the first OP is called &quot;10% roll, 10% romance&quot; preformed by Unison Square Garden. The Japanese J-Pop formation was founded in 2004. The cheerful, expressive vocals with the slightly feminine voice of Saito, Kosuke as well as the rhythmic drumming of Suzuki, Takao and the upbeat guitar are a successful start to the series. The animation of the OP, which uses scenes from the series, also fits and puts the viewer in the right mood for the anime.<br />
The first ED &quot;Maybe the next waltz&quot; is sung by actress and dubbing artist Komatsu, Mikako. Gentle and yet cheerful, it is based on a successful interplay of the orchestra with light emphasis by piano and strings. Together with the very beautiful voice, this results in a fitting and beautiful ending to the series.<br />
The second OP from Ep. 12 is called &quot;Invisible Sensation&quot; and is again from Unison Square Garden. The title is cheerful and optimistic like the first OP. Nevertheless, the animation very aptly conveys a change in the mood of the anime. The expression and presence of the images shown can be described as stressed, controversial and less friendly and entertaining.<br />
The second ED &quot;Swing Heart Direction&quot; is sung again by Komatsu, Mikako. The voice and the music are beautiful, but in my opinion the combination is not quite right. The music is fast-paced and demanding, and Komatsu-san&#039;s voice almost sounds a little pale in comparison. Also the animation to the title only partially fits, but maybe that&#039;s intentional.<br />
The voice actors did a great job overall. But I especially liked two voices. As for the female voices, the soft, feminine, yet very clear sound of Sakura Ayane&#039;s voice speaking Hanaoka Shizuku. With the men, I found Okamoto Nobuhiko&#039;s voice very pleasant. The pitch of his voice matched the calm nature of Hyoudou Kiyoharu very well.<br />
For the particularly good presentation, I would like to add Akasaki Chinatsu as the voice of Hiyama Chinatsu. She portrayed the character of the role very well, which certainly wasn&#039;t easy.<br />
<br />
It is very unfortunate that a series that deals with such an aesthetic sport, especially is so disappointing with regard to well-animated ballroom dance scenes and the corresponding music. Besides this review, I read the manga and my rating would be an 8/10, so it&#039;s not the manga. Unfortunately, not all possibilities have been used in the adaptation of the manga. In view of a greater success, a slight deviation from the original would certainly have been acceptable (IMHO).<br />
<br />
As always, thanks for reading.

    Meh what more to say about the animu, prolly the best sports anime so far i&#039;ve watched. <br />
What the animu lacks? idk<br />
All i know it it&#039;s a mix of feelings, hardship, the undying never give up spirit, bit of romantic dev , amazing animation and s.tracks along with the slow paced but steady CHARACTER DEVELOPEMENT :D (unlike other sports animu&#039;s where mc&#039;s were either dope/prodigy or they develop by the time we reach half of the series. 10/10 YO!<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a mix of all stuff you need- how the mc gets inspiration for doing something he never imagined, how he goes down after a failure, backs

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265389">
        up and shuts everyone else making em stand open mouthed. The part i most loved is prolly the slow paced ch. development: weather it is tad of romance, skills,ability, trusting each other,believing,recovery and the spirit.<br />
<br />
Lastly, i hope there&#039;s gonna be a S2 for the season&#039;s best rom/sports animu :)
