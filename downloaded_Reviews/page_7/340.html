    Once every now and then, we get comedic showstoppers that does what it needs to do: entertain. I’ve seen a lot of comedy shows in the past few years and believe me, Hinamatsuri belongs in a category of its own. It’s entertaining not just on the level of being able to make me laugh but also able to capture the magic of what comedy really is about. It’s only 12 episodes but manages to make an addicting impression.<br />
<br />
As a fan of the manga, delightful is just one of many words that came to mind when I heard about the adaptation. The manga contains over 70+

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281833">
        chapters of memorable content and to fully deliver that value isn’t an easy task. Luckly, Hinamatsuri does something that I noticed many shows doesn’t do these days and that’s being aware of itself. On first viewing, it felt like a challenge to realize what this series is all about. The premise itself can make some people’s eyes roll while the character cast consists of a variety of colorful personalities. To me, Hinamatsuri is like diving into a world of absurdity but coming out of it brings me nothing but a smile and the realization of being entertained. <br />
<br />
From watching the show, I can tell that the director wanted to for entertain the audience. The most evident is the selling of the comedic character reactions. Main characters Hina and Nitta does this the best as they come from very different backgrounds. On the surface level, the two are nothing alike but through interacting with one another, they form a strange bond that makes them almost inseparable. The anime does a phenomenal job at capturing the character expressions with well-timed body language. It creates the sensation of wanting for more every episode and see what characters will do under certain situations. Each episode consists of segments of everyday life activities although there are abnormal events happening from time to time involving psychic powers. Beyond just selling the comedy, this show also does contain some interesting emotional elements too.<br />
<br />
One particular episode showcasing Anzu depicts the realism of homelessness. It’s one of those episodes that you would least expect to see from this particular anime. What attracts me about this show is how it ties in a lot of ideas together. The thematic storytelling may feel random at first but overall has a connection together. Every main or supporting character also delivers moments that are hard to forget. This also includes Hina’s classmates such as Hitomi as she works discreetly at a bar that few knows. It’s also noticeable that the show doesn’t just take place at school or the city either. In a big change in mood, an episode focusing on Mao shows what life is like in isolation. By experimenting ideas like this, it feels like this show constantly evolves and has something for fans to talk about.<br />
<br />
I’ve already mentioned some of the characters but a big question is if the show puts enough value to make the audience care about them. While some characters may not stand out much as the others, I can definitely say with confidence that the main cast is worth watching for their roles. It would have been easy to just let the characters do the talking but instead, the series remarkably showcase their personalities in the most humorous ways possible. A general sense of fatalism can also be felt as some characters are destined to meet or events fated to happen. While some storytelling elements can be predictable in later episodes, it doesn’t hold back with how characters connect with each other.<br />
<br />
Now, there’s an elephant in the room. Once you’ve seen a good amount of episodes, it’s not hard to say that the anime portrays characters in some inappropriate ways. Fan service is present in some episodes and there may be some uncomfortable scenes thrown in by the creators. While this is true on the surface, it should be realized that the anime isn’t presented as a shock value. At its core, Hinamatsuri serves to entertain its audience through creative comedy. The fan service adds more fuel to the fire that way. <br />
<br />
Adapted by studio feel, the anime has production quality that I can say works quite well. The character reactions are the big selling factor animated with extreme style. Somehow, it remains faithful to the overall tone of the show without ever going off-track. It also impresses me that we get to see emotional moments bought to life. It’s very human and despite how silly the anime can be, the show contains episodes that are tearjerking. Character designs looks sharp with the vibrant outlines that makes them stand out too.<br />
<br />
While not being a powerhouse in the music department, Hinamatsuri does boasts a great voicing cast. Nitta, Hina, Anzu, and Hitomi are the primary examples that perfectly fits with their personalities. Every now and then, they can say lines with a straight face under certain circumstances that can’t help but make me laugh. It’s a comedy show and definitely never forgets its intentions. The music also makes certain scenes and montages feel more meaningful. <br />
<br />
Ah, if only Hinamatsuri had more than 12 episodes. The manga contains more material that I would love to see animated on TV. However, it did adapt the series to the extent that made a great impression to me. From character chemistry to the peculiar storytelling, every episode left me with something to talk about. This is a dark horse of the year that I hope people won’t overlook. Crafting comedy isn’t easy these days but I feel that Hinamatsuri accomplished that so well. I am entertained.

    Back when I first started Hinamatsuri in the midst of other shows for the Spring season Hinamatsuri felt different. Compared to the others, it pulled me in and in a different way too. In the first five minutes I was slightly taken aback by the artstyle but when I continued watching it, it hit me with it&#039;s wonder. Hinamatsuri is exactly that kind of anime, and it continued to be so till it&#039;s end, it calms you down, then immediately rushes out with the comedy and before you know it, you&#039;re laughing out loud. Oh and there are tons of heartfelt moments too, what more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281844">
        could you ask for such an innovative and hilarious anime? Original Review published June 22, 2018 on MAL<br />
<br />
For starters, Hinamatsuri is a fresh take among the many comedy anime we see nowadays. It&#039;s not a school romance comedy and thanks to that it pushes out a huge cliche (there are exceptions) right out of the window, add to that it&#039;s supernatural nature mixed with clever comedy and you&#039;ve got a fresh anime that people not only laugh with, but cherish for the coming seasons because you won&#039;t see such an anime so common, not every season, not every year either. Hinamatsuri uses tons of elements and jokes in it&#039;s run and it was very hard for me to find recycled jokes among them, it was all new and innovative and that says a lot about it&#039;s quality as a comedy anime. Oh and by saying it&#039;s supernatural you might think it relies too much on supernatural stupidity to tickle your funny bone? No, the best part is that Hinamatsuri can stand even on normal comedy and make everyday situations so hilarious despite having a huge arsenal of supernatural jokes at its disposal but Hinamatsuri uses both of them very wisely with the end result being us viewers holding down our stomachs while we laugh. <br />
<br />
A huge reason why Hinamatsuri is so incredibly amazing is because it&#039;s got various approaches to the comedy, and it almost always nailed them, first off it has a buildup of jokes, the situation starts getting crazier and crazier and you&#039;re left laughing at every second. This is common in comedy anime since you can put up over the top situations and make people laugh as well, but Hinamatsuri unlike many others not only looks at that but it also looks at the premise where it&#039;s using it in, something surprisingly uncommon in other anime. What am I talking about? Many times we see anime attempt at comedy but use the wrong approach at the wrong time, thus even though the joke was actually funny, the wrong approach didn&#039;t give the writers the result they wanted and this anime thankfully crosses that hurdle. <br />
<br />
Another approach it has to it&#039;s comedy is somewhat of the opposite, it sets your expectations low on purpose before hitting you with the punchline, this also has a largely positive effect since if the joke is successful, it can almost equal the hilarity of the previous take and on the other hand serve as an element of surprise to its viewers which as well plays a huge part in making it so funny since Hinamatsuri rarely failed at this as well. Yet another approach Hinamatsuri took was to use the “straight man” principle to effectively. What is the straight man principle you may ask? It&#039;s when the characters do something stupid and another character takes the “straight man” role and points out the stupidity in shock and while on paper this may seem unfunny, in reality it&#039;s very successful if implemented properly, two of the best and most famous examples of characters using the straight man principle excellently in anime are namely Saiki Kusuo (Saiki Kusuo no PSI Nan) and Shimura Shinpachi (Gintama). Instead of attributing this principle to only one character, Hinamatsuri gives the role to multiple characters depending on the situation and thankfully does it well. <br />
<br />
Why did I list these and explain the different approaches to comedy? It&#039;s because few anime use so many approaches and few of them are successful in doing so as well, and the good news is that Hinamatsuri can use those very well, reason being it keeps them fresh with the comedy and helps keep things varied. <br />
<br />
Note: The following is a comparison of Hinamatsuri, Saiki and Gintama, if you haven&#039;t watched the latter two completely, please skip the next paragraph as you may not understand the references talked about. <br />
<br />
***COMPARISON BEGIN: Since comedy shows get compared a lot, why not compare Hinamatsuri with an anime it shares a lot in common with arguably the giant of comedy anime, Gintama along with a relatively recent anime that&#039;s also been doing fabulous, Saiki Kusuo, note that I used these both as examples as well above for the straight man principle. First off with Gintama, Hinamatsuri shares the nature of smile+tears, meaning that both anime make you laugh with it&#039;s jokes, but it also has it&#039;s sad arcs that give you the feels and usually make many cry. Apart from this, both are supernatural anime (along with Saiki of course) that use their premise very smartly and have varied approaches to comedy, not just one. For Saiki, both feature modern-day Earth but retain the supernatural nature along with the occasional school comedy (but good) thrown in. COMPARISON END***<br />
<br />
All three feature this element and excellently use their numerous weapons at their disposal wisely along with using one of the best comedy methods as well, unpredictability. You never know what comes next and when it does, you&#039;re left laughing your ass out. What does this entail? This entails that Hinamatsuri is an anime comparable to such greats and can stand on its own as well without having to mooch off anything else. Much like the other two, Hinamatsuri also at times jumped straight to the comedy itself without any caution (although this wasn&#039;t used much) and served as possibly the best form of surprise it could muster. Moving away from the comparing and looking at the points that set Hinamatsuri apart from the others is that Hinamatsuri uses an outsmarting “lazy approach”, such that when you&#039;re watching Hinamatsuri, much like Hina, it looks sluggish and slow and lazy as well but the moment you think that this is how the whole episode will be, it lands in a sudden joke and you&#039;re left flabbergasted in laughter (can people be flabbergasted in laughter? Maybe :P) so you&#039;d be dumb to write Hinamatsuri off if you think it&#039;s a bit slow at first because there&#039;s a huge punch coming really soon as well. <br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s step aside from the comedy for a bit since that&#039;s not exactly everything Hinamatsuri offers, we also have the occasional sad arcs. These were usually of Anzu (primarily) and at times a few other characters realising the importance of friendship or a life lesson as well. The reason why people loved Anzu to the point that people very soon ranked her higher than Hina for the best girl of the anime was because her arcs were so damn powerful. Poverty, learning to live as a homeless person, the community you make with them, and many other things beyond that I can&#039;t cover since they&#039;re spoilers, her arcs have a lot of thought and emotion into them and no person with a heart could not at least get a lump in their throat when they see the way she works hard to do her best for her friends who she treats like family as the feeling is mutual, this is really what should make us smile and laugh, the happiness of a human being doesn&#039;t come from being rich, but from enjoying what&#039;s next to us, what we have, not what we want, and this serious message was shown through her in these arcs. Getting why the anime is so amazing? <br />
<br />
On the other side of the spectrum we have the duo who we started with, Nitta and Hina, these two are like father and daughter, despite one being a Yakuza and the other having dangerous superpowers, they went like bread and butter, and for the opposite reasons. If you took them individually, Hina wouldn&#039;t be as funny by herself and Nitta could only be used as a straight man if he&#039;s not with Hina. The anime is such that not only can Hina and Nitta not live without each other, but their comedy as well can&#039;t live without each other, and this is a testament to the genius mangaka behind this. As such, this erases most doubts about people possibly thinking of possibly axing one of the two, but much like Nana and Popo in the Ice Climbers (I s&#039;pose no one will get that NES reference), they both need each other not only to live, but to make us laugh. Needless to say, Hina and Nitta’s sketches leave their mark clearly. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s move to arguably the most powerful character of the show, Hitomi. Why did I call her so? It&#039;s because she highly influences both Hina and Anzu. Anyway, Hitomi is fantastic as a character since she&#039;s very relatable thanks to her being given the straight man (or woman if you may) role by handling the BS that her daily life gives her and her arcs as well were hilarious as well as cute. She suddenly gets forced to work as a bartender and surprisingly becomes adept at her job and this is used as a baseline for many of the jokes at her. She also as mentioned played the straight woman for the crap that she has to deal with Hina and sometimes Anzu and her work. The best part is that she&#039;s amazing since she&#039;s so ordinary in the midst of idiots around her that it&#039;s hilarious in its own right and I seriously can&#039;t complain when even this is used well for it&#039;s jokes. Pretty reflective of the anime itself. <br />
<br />
The thing is that Hinamatsuri has its own share of flaws as well. Even though it&#039;s comedy is almost always on point, if the jokes DO fail, the episode can fall apart pretty quick if nothing is done, and although this did happen once or twice, it pretty much saved itself in the next joke and went on, but this issue does exist and could be done better. And one issue that many point out is that since the anime is named Hinamatsuri, it still doesn&#039;t focus much on Hina in the first place. Although Hinamatsuri&#039;s purpose is to follow and balance screen time for all characters, many times Hina felt off the mark either because she wasn&#039;t given too many lines or she wasn&#039;t the person making the joke at that time. This is also a problem since based on Hina’s character, it&#039;s hard to bring in new stuff for a lazy brat since a lazy brat doesn&#039;t do much in the first place. This shows that you can&#039;t do much with the character as you would with others so Hinamatsuri&#039;s comedy gets held back at times when Hina doesn&#039;t do much. <br />
<br />
Overall, Hinamatsuri is an anime that does a lot, and a lot of that is different from the usual. Apart from being able to stand on its own legs for support, it is comparable to the legends in its genre and can hold its own to a respectable level. It&#039;s truly an all round comedy in part because it makes you cry then laugh in just a span of a minute. Why is that you may ask? It&#039;s because comedy isn&#039;t just laughing at stupidity, comedy is also trying to find the funny in tragedy and the sad times, that&#039;s what Hinamatsuri is all about. And that&#039;s what comedy should be all about isn&#039;t it?<br />
<br />
P.S: This season has a multitude of amazing last episodes demonstrating the best of the show’s offerings overall and Hinamatsuri was no exception. The last episode excellently showed us everything that made the show so amazing. A combination of feels, slapstick comedy and recent nostalgia made for an epic end to an epic anime (despite that minor cliffhanger?), and as a fan, I couldn&#039;t ask for anything more. It&#039;s a fan’s dream come true. Here&#039;s hoping we see a season 2 anytime soon!<br />

    What makes a great comedy anime?<br />
<br />
Comedy<br />
<br />
Timing<br />
<br />
Character reactions<br />
<br />
Direction<br />
<br />
Character relationships<br />
<br />
These are all ways to make a comedy anime better. However, unlike my 3D Kanojo real girl and Love is hard for an Okatu reviews where I compared them with each to see which one was overall better (spoilers Wotaku Love is hard for an otaku won) but instead I just want to talk about I believe that Hinamatsru or Hina Festival is by far one of the best comedy/slice anime to ever come out. Am not saying that its competitor Comic Girls was bad or anything, in fact, Comic Girls was a good comedy/slice of life anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281842">
        that made me laugh a couple of times. However, it still wouldn’t have a chance against Hinamatsuri<br />
<br />
So what made Hinamatsuri so great?<br />
How did it end up dominating the Spring 18 season?<br />
You will find out soon enough.<br />
<br />
One night, a strange object falls on the head of Nitta, a member of the yakuza. Inside the box is a strange young girl named Hina. She has tremendous supernatural powers, and Nitta finds himself reluctantly taking her in. Her powers can come in handy for his yakuza business, but he also runs the risk of her using them on him! Not to mention, if she doesn&#039;t use her powers, she will eventually go berserk and destroy everything around her. Nitta and Hina&#039;s strange life together is just beginning.<br />
<br />
The story is brilliant and very well crafted.<br />
<br />
For starters, the show does a nice job at building its own world where the anime perfectly showcases every social group in the city from the middle school students, the Yakusa, workers from the shopping district to even the homeless people. The show also does a fantastic job of displaying character interaction based on different social groups.<br />
<br />
For example in Hitomi’s character arc where she was forced to work as a bartender, we see that many social groups like the Yakusha’s seeing the fact that a middle school girl was working in a bar. Like with Hitomi classmates where they thought that Hitomi is working in a bar as a bartender as well doing naughty things with adults and Yakusa. However as soon they enter the bar that there was no naughty activity going on as Hitomi is just severing the adult&#039;s beer meaning the people in the ear are not paedophiles as they just want a drink.<br />
<br />
Despite Hitomi, the character arc is the most comedic of the bunch her rise to fame was handled very well.<br />
<br />
The comedy in Hinamatsuri is brilliant to the core. The comedy and jokes are really funny as they are all timed and most importunity that are not repetitive. What makes the comedy more brilliant is how the characters react to the comedic situations that go on in this series.<br />
<br />
The one thing that I really adored about Hinamatsuri is doing a great job at tackling the serious topic and themes such as homeless, humanity, running way, acceptance, family, gambling, and money and does a great job at exploring them in full depth as well treating the themes and topics with respect.<br />
<br />
The thing that sold me about this series the most is despite being heavily a comedy/slice of life show character actually gets development. You see most comedy anime would often return to the status quo meaning once these characters had they spotlight by the next episode they return to they usually self’s removing all of the character development in the process. This never happens in Hinamatsuri as the characters and even the world itself change and evolves as the series goes.<br />
<br />
(Spoilers Ahead)<br />
<br />
The best example of this was in Anzu character arc where she started off as this tough girl who came to earth to take Hina home as well stealing food and drinks from the local shopping district however all of this changes when she cannot return back of where she came from and because of that she became homeless as a result. Eventually, Anzu lives with a bunch of homeless people and while she’s was living with them she learns about the value of money and the power of community and friendship.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately at a certain point of the series, she would have to leave the homeless community so she can be live with a couple that owns a restaurant. After that point we the audience see how her time in the homeless community has affected her both psychically and mentally to a point where she is seen trying to adapt to her new surroundings and things that she can now do such as having a bath to learning the value and importance of money.<br />
<br />
These are things that I want to see in anime more often because the anime medium itself has the potential to present life lessons and serious topics to the viewer and I glad Hina Festival did a great job at handling its serious topics and themes.<br />
<br />
The characters in Hinamatsuri were all brilliant and very likeable in their own ways. The one thing that I praise about this show is despite being a comedy slice of life show characters actually have characters development. A lot of comedy anime such as Konosuba, School Rumble and a few others are afraid of leaving its comedic ways. I know some of them are padorys where they are perfectly happy of being comedic but the problem was especially for Konosuba where at many times the show cock teases the audience about being more than a comedy where characters get developed but instead of doing that and taking risks that show decided to be the same comedic show from episode 1 however in the progress the show completely lost its charm to a point where it became unfunny and repetitive.<br />
<br />
Hinamatsuri completely avoids all the pitfalls and traps that caught other comedy were not only the characters were likeable but the actually get development plus they are still actually funny and they don’t repeat the same jokes/gags to the audience.<br />
<br />
Nitta is a great character that I really liked. Sure may appear as your generic Yakusa member in the beginning but he honestly has a softer side to him that makes him an interesting character to watch. I also loved his father and daughter relationship with Hina as it well-executed and was intriguing to watch.<br />
<br />
Hina is, unfortunately, my least favorite character in the series. Don&#039;t me wrong she&#039;s not a character by any means as she is a good character in her own right. The problem is that if you compare to the other girls in the series especially Anzu who has the most character development she didn&#039;t really stand out. Yes she&#039;s has a good character arc with Nitta where they learn the importance of a father and daughter relationship but honestly, I thought Nitta learned a lot more than Hina did. Yes, she can be interesting characters at times but I thought she was nowhere as interesting as Anzu, Nitta, and Hitomi. Overall Hina is a good character but she gets overshadowed compare to the other girls in the series.<br />
<br />
If I had to pick my favorite character in this show I would pick Hitomi. As a character, Hitomi was an absolute joy too because she went from being a typical middle school girl who is timed to a general hard-worker who is very skilled at the things that she does to a point where became a key member in several businesses. I also really adored her character interactions and arcs.<br />
<br />
While Hitomi is my personal favorite character in the series Anzu is by far the best character in the show in terms of writing and character development. Compare to the other girls in the series she&#039;s probably the most flawed and human character in the series despite being superman with powers. Not to mention her character arc was well written to the core.<br />
<br />
Mao who comes in late in the series is an interesting character.<br />
She an esper girl who has been stuck on the island who is trying to find her fellow espers. Despite having way less screen time in the due to her coming in the series very late she’s still managed to be an intriguing character that I really liked. More than Hina who had way more screen time than Mao.<br />
The supporting characters are great in their own ways as they all memorable and intriguing to watch from start to finish.<br />
<br />
Visually Hinamatsuri is pretty great.<br />
Studio feel did a great job at sticking with the rough style of its source material with its jagged, textured linear and Gratuitous Overlays. The show also has great use of lovely and modern colour palettes which gives the show it&#039;s own visual flare<br />
I really adored the facial character expressions that series has to offer as it&#039;s more tension to both the comedic and serious situations that go one in the series.<br />
<br />
My favorite characters expression in the series was defiantly Hitomi because the way she opens her month sticks her tongue out whenever she thinks that she going to get caught by someone important because after all, she is working as a bartender at a young age.<br />
<br />
The animation is pretty good for what it was so I have no complaints whatsoever.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack in Hinamatsuri is great as it perfectly represents the daily life of Ashigawa.<br />
The opening theme Distance by Rie Murakawa is easily the best opening from this spring 18 anime season as it&#039;s very catchy and perfectly captures the setting and tone of the series.<br />
The ending theme Sake to Ikura to 893 sung by Nitta&#039;s Seiyuu actor was a masterpiece.<br />
<br />
Before we get to the sub vs dub section of the review I just want to praise the fact that both the opening and ending evolving as the show goes along and this was perfectly shown by a character named Utako where if you keep on watching the opening each episode you will start to see how less important the character actually became and for this case was Utako where only appears once in the opening in episode 10 while she&#039;s never present in the ending at all in episode 10. Another thing I really like is how it the ending theme features evolving supporting characters where I honestly hope more do theses evolving opening/ending themes in the future because one it really makes them unique and two instead of pointless recap episodes we the viewers actually see visually of how did the series progressed.<br />
<br />
The sub is very good overall and I have no complaints about it however what really surprised me about Hinamatsuriwas the dub. The dub for Hinamatsuri is brilliant and well-acted.<br />
<br />
Overall I adored Hinamatsuri Now I can safely say that not only Hinamatsuri single-handily dominated the Spring 18 season but it&#039;s also one of the best slice of life/comedy series period.<br />
The story was amazing and well created. The characters were wonderful and interesting. The production values were great and the soundtrack is awesome.<br />
It truly feels like the creators for this anime put a lot of care and effort when making this anime and am glad.<br />
Hopefully, this show gets a second season sometime in the future as well Blu Ray release by Funimation in the US and UK.<br />
<br />
If you looking for a slice of life/comedy anime that is very funny and has great character development than I recommend Hinamatsuri.

    I really can&#039;t see why so many people are liking this thing. It simply isn&#039;t funny. Yes, it does have some moments that it actually gets you off guard, but most of the time you can easily guess when it will break expectancy, and how. <br />
<br />
Characters are poor, or at least they can&#039;t shine alone, and there is very few interaction between them, many jokes are about the adversities of a single character, many of those aren&#039;t funny. I understand that good part of jokes comes from sad things, but that doesn&#039;t mean sad things are fun by themselves. I don&#039;t really think the writer

          <span style="display: none;" id="review283879">
        or the director worked well together, but on my opinion both are bad. <br />
<br />
Story is weak as in any comedy. Yes, it tries to give some progression to the side characters, but Hina, which is the funniest one, get&#039;s very little progress. And a main problem is that it doesn&#039;t keep the premise at all. The superpowers, are barely used, even when they should. Yes, in good part it would brake the jokes, exactly because those jokes are made for a powerless sitcom, and not this kind of thing...<br />
<br />
Art style is weak and plain creepy on those close-ups. Maybe that was the intention, the author thought it was funny, but for me, it wasn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
Overall, you can skip this one. I didn&#039;t have much fun and ended up skipping most a good part of it.<br />

    A lot of comedy anime are based on formulas. Here is a premise. Here are jokes that arise from that premise. Basic sitcom stuff. Hinamatsuri takes these fundamentals and grows them to reach a much higher form of comedic storytelling.<br />
<br />
<br />
First the Fundamentals of Comedic Storytelling<br />
<br />
<br />
It should first and foremost be stated that humor is subjective. Though this doesn’t mean that there are not techniques used to craft jokes. Just because the jokes do not land for everyone doesn’t make them not jokes. This can make it hard to discuss comedy. If we disregard everything as subjective, the ability to have a conversation is lost, so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279123">
        let’s talk about some fundamentals.<br />
<br />
In gag like Azumanga Daioh, much of the humor is derived from the conversations the characters have and extreme versions of everyday life. Meanwhile, in the serialised harem anime Nisekoi, it often had episodes where the humor was created by an event, often putting the protagonist and one of the heroines in a situation where they naturally bounced off each other to create humorous dialogue. Nisekoi is a traditional sitcom-like premise, but in many ways, they are forced to stunt the development of their characters to ensure that the jokes can continue as they always have. This is where Hinamatsuri comes in.<br />
lets talk about 1st eposode...plz dont read this before watching.. <br />

Hinamatsuri benefits from smart presentation. It presents its most ridiculous moments in a straightforward, unapologetic manner, as if a girl in a metal pod teleporting into a high-rise apartment and landing on a yakuza officer&#039;s head is no big deal. As the show&#039;s comedic straight man, Nitta&#039;s personality helps out on this front. His reactions tend to fall on the “stunned speechless” end of the spectrum, which is more understated than the panicked, cartoonish screaming we&#039;d likely see from an everyman teenage protagonist. The contrast between those low-key responses and Hina&#039;s bizarre behavior (not to mention her hilariously odd-looking transport egg) places extra emphasis on just how strange this all is, and that in turn makes the humor more effective.<br />
<br />
Hinamatsuri is about yakuza and psychics… kinda?... omegalul ... just watch it ...<br />
<br />
Hinamatsuri is a story that follows the life of the yakuza Nitta, who ends up having to take care of Hina, a girl with physic powers. As the series goes on its cast expands to include other yakuza, psychics and Hina’s classmates. The comedy arises from interactions between these characters, and absurdist situations that the characters end up in. The anime spends a lot of time establishing who the characters are and how they act through the humor. artwork and sense of comedic timing really shine in gags .<br />

The Maturation of Comedy<br />
<br />
Hinamatsuri is not the only comedy to tackle these elements. Even so, it’s success at it is certainly worth the look. It so perfectly creates something greater out of an already great manga. Comedy genere are often accused of focusing on flat, un-developing characters. While that critique is both misguided and generally wrong, Hinamatsuri provides a perfect counterpoint to that argument. As the characters grow, so does the storytelling and the jokes. Hinamatsuri proves the sheer height of perfection that a comedy series can strive to accomplish.<br />

I&#039;m enjoying its particular brand of lunacy, so I&#039;ll be sticking around to see where it goes. If combining Cromartie High School levels of weirdness with an “unusual dad raises weird kid” story sounds like your idea of a good time, by all means give this show a try.

    Hinamatsuri is an anime about this Yakuza-bro who is totally a badass. He meets this weird alien girl AND THEN THEY FUCK. Oh wait, wrong series. And then they become something like &quot;friends&quot; or &quot;family&quot;, and instead of developing as characters they rather start a trip to self-discovery and find new sides within themselves, but also from each others. Pretty neat.<br />
<br />
<br />
My favorite part of this series is Hina. Her whole presence radiates disinterest. Whenever she does anything, it comes off as a combination of curiosity and not giving a fuck. For example, even when she is impressed she be like &quot;woah&quot;, but also, &quot;meh&quot;. This

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279120">
        creates quite interesting comedic situations. The same thing is also done with drama. This, on the other hand, quite (tedious word incoming) subtly hints about the complexity of their personality.<br />
<br />
<br />
Every character introduced thus far has had an important role in the series, expanding its universe and viewer&#039;s understanding of the main characters, however, never feeling like they solely exist for the main characters. Instead, for once they feel like real people. The series also contains quite a few pop culture reference that can be seen as eastern eggs for popular movies that did it before Hinamatsuri. For example, the room scene is clearly a reference to The Terminator (1984). Our biking scene is obviously from E.T. (1982). Without a doubt, the series has a lot to offer.<br />
<br />
<br />
The art represents its source material quite faithfully. The battle scenes/super natural powers are animated quite neatly. Especially those parts where airflow effects characters&#039; facial expressions. The voice acting can only be called a smart choice. Since none of the characters comes off as purely comedic, the seiyuu work is what essentially makes our character feel like real people. This plays a huge part in making the series look like a believable Yakuza space oddity. It&#039;s a job done right. The OST, and especially the ending and opening songs quite well capture the uplifting nature of the series. <br />
<br />
<br />
After 4 episodes, I can pretty much recommend Hinamatsuri to everyone. Especially those who are looking for airing series to try. This is the one you should be currently following.

    Kept waiting for something to happen.<br />
<br />
This show is fairly easy to watch and there are some moments that will make you laugh. <br />
Overall though nothing really happened. You would think a show about girls with telekinetic powers and some shadowy organization would have more violence, fights or anything really.<br />
Instead you are treated to 12 episodes of Hina wanting food and lazing about. Nitta caring for and often complaining about Hina. Ansu&#039;s life as a homeless teen (which was probably the most interesting part of the show) and finally Hitomi working in Nitta&#039;s favorite bar and occasionally helping Hina or Ansu.<br />
<br />
This show is very episodic, with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285448">
        very little in the way of a contiguous story line. After 12 episodes there was no indication of where these super powered girls came from, or what the &quot;Organization&quot; is, why they exist etc. Like I said, it&#039;s 12 episodes of nothing.<br />
<br />
Animation was fine. If you care, there was little to no fan service.<br />
Soundtrack was fine.<br />
<br />
Go into this one with low expectations and maybe you will enjoy it more than I did.<br />
<br />
5.5 out of 10

    Hinamatsuri begins with a problematic setup that justifies property damage, violence, throwing money to spoil little girls, with a narrative that asserts that a patriarch is necessary to control women who can&#039;t control themselves. It is a mildly funny skit comedy, provided that you accept the terms of this premise, that it is perfectly normal for girls to throw temper tantrums, while at the end of the day, men have to take care of them. Which is some backwards misogynistic crap that insults modern senses. Some people characterize Hinamatsuri as &quot;feminist&quot;, but this only makes sense if little girls who throw their weight around in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review334969">
        psychic powers, but don&#039;t know what to do after, constitutes feminism. Luckily, the main plot seems to die out by episode 3, as a pretty solid background cast develops -- although that development dies out by episode 6, leaving the true genre: episodic comedic skits.<br />
<br />
The best moments of the show happen whenever the main characters are NOT on screen. Some of the side characters learn the harsh realities of economic stratification, homelessness, while other engage in absurd situations regarding the workplace. These moments can be heartwarming and funny, but only until we remember the disgusting dynamics between the weak doormat &quot;nice guy&quot; of our protagonist Nitta, and the manipulative brat that the show is named after. All with a strange backdrop of Yakuza glorification. Apparently, when a homeless girl drops into your house, you shouldn&#039;t call the cops because you don&#039;t want to &quot;owe them one&quot;, you adopt them. And while Nitta is very much attracted to grown women, the problems in this setup shouldn&#039;t escape notice.<br />
<br />
This creates a bipolar dynamic of the absurd juxtaposed with the real world. And I&#039;m not talking about the psychic powers. I&#039;m talking about a world where yakuza who don&#039;t do anything all day have unlimited funds to spoil girls and refurnish their apartments when the girl destroys everything on a whim, where these yakuza act as both policemen and run soup kitchens for the homeless, and are charitable enough to drive around handing out hundreds of US dollars worth to random people on the streets like they&#039;re Mike Tyson. And the narrative wants you to think that lazy, destructive little girls and an irresponsible yakuza are &quot;good people&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sure, if you think fiction gives you a get-out-of-jail-free card, so you could turn off your moral filter and trick yourself, then you might accept the premise and get to enjoying yourself. But then, what stops you from thinking the fictional protagonist in School Days deserves to be your best bud, or the fictional tentacle monster that rapes underage lolis is a good guy? I digress.<br />
<br />
The main problem with Hinamatsuri strangely isn&#039;t the setup, which as I&#039;ve said, is glossed over by episode 3, but that the entire problem was just forgotten. More little girls like Anzu and Mao come to Japan to retrieve Hina, and each getting stuck in our world for some stupid reason, and this plot point develops no further. The responsibility forced upon Nitta is never addressed, except in a haphazardly comedic way, and the economic comparison thread between Hina and Anzu dies out soon. In short, the show doesn&#039;t know what it wants to be, and it attempts to fool us into believing it is something it&#039;s not.<br />
<br />
Everything after episode 6 sets up half-episode long scenarios that lead to punchlines like an episode of Saiki Kusuo or Sakamoto Desu Ga. It does explain the intro through a rather pathetic filler-like skit. Trust me, it&#039;s not that important. Everyone that tells you you need to finish this show to &quot;understand&quot; the character development is wrong. There is no character development with Hina, and the development with Anzu, which is probably the best part of the show, happen through practically 1-2 episodes early on, in which she transforms from the violence, naive anti-villain trope into the &quot;perfect daughter&quot;.<br />
<br />
You should watch episodes 3-6 and spare yourself the rest. Treat it like an OVA.

    A diamond in the rough, very funny and innovative story blend with a can&#039;t be better context for a comedy that stand out from the normal highschool rom com superpower stuff. Also the show includes some real life situation and even able to make gags out of it while doing the educational stuff at the same time. The art is nice although it&#039;s liek they are catching up with the new flashing style of A place further than the universe and Yuru camp, but the character design is funny, fressh and hillarious as well. Absolutely a must watch for this season.

    I really did not expect to like this anime so much. I saw a funny meme on fb which lead me to this anime and I really enjoyed watching Hinamatsuri. It is not an anime that will make you laugh all the time but it does keep a smile on your face throughout.<br />
Some moments were predictable, but that&#039;s what makes it funny. The story embraces all the cliche moments that you see in an anime. It makes those moments funnier. There were also some heartwarming moments which almost made me cry. <br />
So as a conclusion I can say that anyone can watch this anime even

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314908">
        if you don&#039;t watch comedy. It&#039;s only 12 episodes long and the story progresses quite nicely but leaves the end on a cliffhanger in a way. But it doesn&#039;t matter. <br />
Just watch this show if you like comedy and even if you don&#039;t still try it

    Quick Thoughts:<br />
Hinamatsuri had some funny moments, but it was underwhelming overall.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
There&#039;s some continuity between episodes, but the series is generally episodic. The POV switches between several characters: mainly Hina, her friends, and her caretaker Nitta. I thought this format worked well since Hina was too one-dimensional to be the primary focus. Most of the scenarios were pretty typical for this kind of comedy, but I did find Anzu&#039;s episodes pretty unique in that they covered topics like homelessness, frugalness, and morals from a different perspective. As far as genres, I&#039;d say Hinamatsuri was mostly comedy and SoL, but there were some attempts at tear jerking

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358657">
        or heartwarming moments. One of the main issues I had was that a lot of exposition felt pointless. You could take away the yakuza and alien/supernatural elements without changing the story much.<br />
<br />
Art/Sound:<br />
I found art-style and animation appealing overall. I thought some of faces (Hina and friends) looked samey, but character designs were fine. Backgrounds were good, and I don&#039;t remember any animation issues. With the voice acting, it wasn&#039;t exactly a star-studded cast but I think they got the job done. <br />
<br />
Character:<br />
The characters were hit-or-miss for me. They were ok when it came to their comedic roles, but there&#039;s not enough depth behind them for the more sentimental moments to land. A large part of this is how their backgrounds hardly mattered within the context of the story. Hina is introduced with having powers that must be frequently to prevent it from building up and losing control, yet they&#039;re hardly relevant outside of of the first few episodes.  Nitta&#039;s yakuza isn&#039;t used for much more than a couple jokes and an explanation for his income. Anzu is one of the only characters with development, but that &#039;development&#039; just turns her into a completely different character over just a couple episodes. I found Hitomi to be the most likable of cast, but she got the least screen time among the main cast.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I think a large part of the enjoyment is how likeable/relatable you find the characters, because there&#039;s not much else really going on in this anime.

    TLDR Review at the bottom. Hopefully, that helped, thank you for reading it in advance.<br />
<br />
By now, it is common knowledge that comedy is a hit or miss. You either find the content funny, or you don&#039;t at all. Usually, comedy in anime is systematic in that if it isn&#039;t a parody, there is a formula used to death to just make a comedy. I will use an example to show you what I mean:<br />
<br />
Simon: &quot;Bob man, it&#039;s freezing down here and you have no coat on, how are you not cold!&quot;<br />
*3 seconds later*<br />
Bob: &quot;Huh. Oh... it&#039;s cold? I guess you are right&quot;<br />
Simon: (through thought) *insert

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354543">
        funny anime blue shock face here* &quot;How the hell did you just realise that now...&quot;<br />
<br />
Comedy in anime relies on a silly situation in which a funny reaction occurs right after. I don&#039;t find that a problem, it is just that the reason for such a situation to exist in the first place makes no sense to the person&#039;s life, rather, it makes sense to their personality, so it is easy to whip out a few of these scenarios whenever it is needed since personality exists constantly within a person. Yeah, you have a life so you could say the same thing applies, though people&#039;s lives aren&#039;t constant comedic chaos, even the craziest people have their peaceful hours. Anime isn&#039;t supposed to be the most realistic thing in the world but it just makes for shortcuts for even sorry excuses of a story to have decent comedy without any effort whatsoever. This is the true average of anime comedy, there is nothing new to bring to the table other than that. Of course, if the execution is done well, then that is a completely different story, in fact, most comedies depend on execution rather than just having a funny character. In recent times, however, most comedy, even if it is a sub-genre, feels the same and use a particular system to make a comedy anime.<br />
<br />
One could argue that silly situation to funny reaction formula is the case with Hinamatsuri. Though from a wider perspective of things, Hinamatsuri characters would say otherwise, in a world much like ours, there still exists psychics who act like regular people, despite their funny or not personality. Yes, there still exists a silly situation to a funny reaction but it&#039;s not because someone is funny, rather, something around them is funny. So, is Hinamatsuri&#039;s comedy original? No. But I don&#039;t think it is half-assed either. It is just, a good comedy. Hinamatsuri has a rather average comedy to it, but, it feels like because of the writers understanding of the characters and plot, it becomes effortlessly good.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story - 8:<br />
Hinamatsuri story takes no time to explain an obvious situation. It sets itself into play as soon as the beginning starts. You would imagine a yakuza having a psychic to take care of would lead to some crazy plot action, but the story does otherwise, it is pretty chill for the most part after episode 1. You could say that this is an absolute wasted potential of a story. What is the point of having a psychic who used to commit great atrocities at her old home not be abused power-wise by someone who is literally a yakuza? Well, does it always have to be this way? I mean, tons of people would have seen this coming if that was the case. Instead, there is a twist with Hinamasturi which simplifies to, &quot;so you live here now, let&#039;s be chill with each other&quot;. That is the cool start that the story gives. It just goes right in, not into any madness, but a rather simple situation with unordinary people. It is pretty much maintained throughout the entirety of the story in regards to Hina&#039;s and Nitta&#039;s life of living together.<br />
<br />
But then you ask yourself, well, because there is such a calming atmosphere between two dangerous people, what kind of story comes out of it? Well, Hinamatsuri is episodic. Episodic plots usually tend to contribute nothing to the main story at hand, I have seen this in quite a few anime. And even when there is some segment that has a say on character development or the finale of the story. It usually isn&#039;t done well due to being too late. So, what does this story do to counter that? It kinda just gives a middle finger up to developing finales and overarching stories and just focuses on the character development within episodic plots. With such a calm and interesting duo to work with, I think it worked well since there wasn&#039;t anything deep with the characters, to begin with. So, naturally, day in day out antics become the story of the show.<br />
<br />
Hinamatsuri isn&#039;t just about Nitta and Hina, there is also the story of Anzu and Hitomi which gives the more emotional sides of the anime if you wish to put it like that. Anzu&#039;s story, in particular, without going ahead and explaining the whole plot, is about growth from zero. She learns about the things around her from a different viewpoint than Hina with more value due to the different people she ends up spending her time with, though again. Another overpowered psychic just not using her powers? What is the point in that? Well, it&#039;s the story&#039;s twist on things. The treatment the story gave to Hina, happens with Anzu too. Crazy action with overpowered people doesn&#039;t mean it makes for the correct way to go around things. Learning is a cool experience in itself. That is Anzu&#039;s story of Hinamatsuri. Slowly trying to find a comfortable place in life with the people she encounters and the values she has learned along the way.<br />
<br />
Hitomi. Again. Not too much detail, but her story is about hard work. Like, *very hard* work for her age. When I mentioned comedy before, I mentioned how it can be used for someone&#039;s life to make the scenarios rather than their personality. Well, Hitomi&#039;s side of the story does that, it is also on the emotional/dramatic side of the story giving it both comedy and drama to deal with, though the dramatic side of things come in later. Suddenly getting a job as a young student made for quite an original place for comedy to be used, but along the way, it begins to become obvious that work is hard. Very hard. And what Hinamatsuri does is poke fun at that concept through Hitomi all the while still retaining its funny atmosphere as usual, rather than a new dark comedy placement.<br />
<br />
All in all, 3 stories in an anime, one being quite serious (Anzu), one being antics (Hina + Nitta), and one being both (Hitomi). It made for a nice mix of things and quite a nice idea that doesn&#039;t get used a lot. Certainly very good content.<br />
<br />
<br />
Visuals/Art - 8:<br />
The visuals are just barely an 8. Mostly because of the animation, I notice that more frames are used in more or less every motion that takes place throughout the entire duration, whether it be a little head turn or a full out fight. It&#039;s pretty good detail to put into the anime, the art, however, although unique, still takes some features from other generic art styles, it is just all polished at the end giving it its style to claim. <br />
<br />
<br />
Audio/Sound - 6:<br />
I&#039;m not going to lie, I came out of Hinamatsuri not having a single ost stuck in my head, to be fair, I didn&#039;t even binge this, but I still watched chunks of it in one go. I think it was supposed to be for an &quot;in the moment&quot; kinda sounds rather than anything intentionally catching, or in other words, the normal stuff you forget about 99% of the time assuming you don&#039;t make your way back to YT to listen to it. Saying that however, the OP and the ED are catchy, more so the OP. It brings nothing new to the table, but what standard anime OP does. The seiyuu do a pretty good job with the characters too, not too much to go on about with that in mind, other than Hitomi&#039;s funny voices to mix in with a shocked face, or Nitta when he goes dead inside.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters - 8:<br />
With their respective stories, the characters also bring interesting qualities to tell. Starting with Hina, she is an emotionless kinda girl who loves to eat and sleep. Other than her past life of taking orders to do God knows what, she just chills with Nitta getting into a ton of trouble with him breaking his possessions one by one. I don&#039;t think Hina offers a lot to the story than just being that gag-like character, which I talked about before and how that is like a cheat code for comedy but she isn&#039;t only just breaking stuff and doing dumb shit, she just has fun with Nitta as well getting into dumb situations with him. <br />
<br />
Talking about Nitta, he is a selfish guy looking for ways to get Hina out of his life when she is at her peak annoyance. At other times though, he is just chilling with Hina eating or playing video games. He is the guy in the story getting into stupid situations all the time. I don&#039;t think he is a bad character but that is all he means in the story, with this though, he has the role of the normal guy too. He isn&#039;t dense or anything cliche like that, he also assists in a situation and offers when something must be done. Overall, chill dude.<br />
<br />
Anzu, as implied in the story section of this review, is quite a moral girl, that is after episode 2 however, like Hina in the start, she abuses her powers with those around here, but then she starts learning the real struggles a few unfortunate members of society must face. With this, she gains good values and morals to make her become a fully-fledged person making the right decisions, she cares about those around her and helps others when she can. She may come across as just one of those nice girls of anime, but her development will make you say otherwise, it becomes natural that she is a nice person rather than already existing as one for the sake of having a character that fits the role. All in all, she has very good character development throughout the series, making her quite an enjoyable person to watch.<br />
<br />
Hitomi, quite an unfortunate character, as said before, is made to poke fun at people working and how that is additionally harder with her school life. She is pretty much dead inside every time something silly happens, you end up feeling quite bad for her but that is the harsh reality the anime uses to poke fun at. It&#039;s not bad how they go around using Hitomi in such a way. It makes for a slightly dark but contradicting smooth way to make for comedy by poking at some serious matters.<br />
<br />
Other side characters aren&#039;t anything good, to be honest, they just exist as plot devices for the MCs, unless it is Mao who has her own little story which is all over the place.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 7:<br />
Funny and deep. That is pretty much the entire premise. I laugh at things quite easily and even when talking about how Hinamatsuri&#039;s comedy varies from the normal comedy given in anime, it does fall victim to the same average comedy at times. The execution of those senses isn&#039;t bad though, if anything, slightly better than the rest. All in all, it is a pretty good comedy anime.<br />
<br />
Overall - 7.4 (7)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
TLDR Review:<br />
<br />
Story - 8: Three stories in one from antics to quite serious matters to both. All with great timed funny moments.<br />
Visuals/Art - 8: Animation is slightly more detail and art is polished.<br />
Audio/Sound - 6: Nothing memorable but the OP and maybe the ED. Seiyuus did a good job too.<br />
Characters - 8: Good character growth following the environment they are in.<br />
Enjoyment - 7: Fuuny and deep, while it can come across as generic the execution can all for otherwise.<br />
Overall - 7.4 (7)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As of the time this review is created, the score for Hinamatsuri is 8.24 which I honestly think is quite high. Even so, it is a good comedy I would recommend for all, it can be chill here, serious with a humourous atmosphere there. It&#039;s a good mix of everything necessary. So, is it worth the watch? Certainly.

    Hinamatsuri is an outstanding masterpiece of situational humour and a brilliant commentary on social behavior.<br />
<br />
There are no jokes in this show, it&#039;s all about context. With an unrealistic premise of telekinetic girls appearing out of nowhere, a wholesome yakuza and a middle schooler working in the most bizarre positions we follow each distinct personality as they respond to these situations, in the most humane ways.<br />
<br />
What I also found particularly great about this show was the fact that every single character does exactly the opposite of what is expected of them by their premises and yet feels uniquely authentic to their new inserted contexts based on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review382539">
        their personalities. This expectation x behavior is something that it&#039;s constantly addressed throughout the series and by different characters.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t remember the last time I felt pain from laughing so much. <br />
<br />
After finishing the first season I was quite sad to find out that a second season is yet to be confirmed. I&#039;ll definitely read the manga (now completed), but it&#039;s impossible not to get attached to the incredible job that the animation studio, voice actors and production have achieved with this story.

    Its been a while since I found a comedy anime/tv show that really made me laugh out loud and at the same time made me go into tears. <br />
<br />
One of the best comedy anime I ve seen, with an incredible and unexpected slice of life<br />
 <br />
STORY 8 I ART 10 I SOUND 9 I CHARACTER 10 I ENJOYMENT 10 I OVERALL 9.4<br />
<br />
So whats Hinamatsuri about?<br />
<br />
Well its about many things actually, three main girls with each one of them with really different personalities surrounded by a lot of intersting characters<br />
<br />
Hina a girl with incredible psychic powers that suddenly crash in the apartment of a yakuza member

          <span style="display: none;" id="review283674">
        named Nitta, even when at first Hina was a pain for Nitta, he adopts her as his own daughter.<br />
<br />
Anzu the girl with not so great psychic which purpose was to defeat Hina and ends being a homeless person.<br />
<br />
and Hitomi(my favorite) a normal middle schooler who cant say no to anyone who asks her for help, which is how she gets into a lot of intersting stuff such as bartending an age 15<br />
<br />
So I broke down the main characters, so why you should why this show?<br />
<br />
First of all the development and relationships.<br />
<br />
Relationships in Hinamatsuri are incredibly well developed Nita and Hina form a bond, becoming more and more like a Father and Daughter, you see how the Yakuza member starts getting more attached to Hina even though she only causes him problems to a point that she even gets disowned, Hina as she grows closer to Nita, she starts becoming more a part of his life, his family and his friendly yakuza members and adapting to the life he is living. <br />
<br />
Anzu becomes homeless and starts to gets food by stealing, later on  she is teached by the homeless people how to make a legal living, she becomes closed with an old man, and she is kind of &quot;adopted&quot; by him and get into a grand father-daughter relationship, that makes incredible funny and tear jerker moments<br />
<br />
and Hitomi becomes attached to the clientele of the bar she is working which lead us to an incredible and intersting plot through all the series<br />
<br />
Every relationship in Hinamatsuri is incredibly developed, supporting cast is relevant and actually makes the gags and plot improve, &#039;I havent seen such an incredible chemistry among characters in years.<br />
<br />
Comedy<br />
<br />
The best aspect of the show, what mades Hinamatsuri comedy different is not just gags or absurdly scenes or moments but it doesn’t stop at just making funny jokes. Jokes don’t bog down the pace because they’re seamlessly woven into the story and character arcs, the jokes are not part of the story, the story is part of the jokes and its amazing.<br />
<br />
Comedy is so well directed in this show, that even the exaggerating animated faces are so well timed, the fact that the gags stick even into further episodes, makes this show gold, it reminds me a lot of Konosuba first episodes (Aqua being eaten by a frog). Amazing Humour.<br />
<br />
FInal Thoughts<br />
<br />
I really want to write a lot on this section but I dont want to ruin it for you, Hinamatsuri is really worth it as a comedy show, it has one the freshest comedy I have seen in years in any mean possible, it has no underdeveloped or unnecessary characters, the slice of life in this is just perfect, not to much to be consider a drama but enough to make a balance for the really amazing story, in the same episode you might find yourself crying of laughter and suddenly tearing apart, its such a rollercoaster. I havent seen something like this in a while, so I hope you can feel the same way this show made me feel.<br />
<br />
Give it a try, you wouldn&#039;t be disappointed.

    I came to this show expecting a silly show about psychokinetic girls and yakuza members getting up to mischief, but I left with a lot more than I was expecting. <br />
This is my first MAL review, and it will contain *spoilers*!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The show starts off as a normal enough comedy, with great animation and well designed characters. The gags are quick and funny, and never failed to make me laugh. The infamous &#039;fight scene&#039; from the second episode and the ever brilliant &#039;girly club&#039; scene are particularly great. But as the show expands, it not only maintains its comedy and writing, but also touches on themes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301321">
        of childhood, growing up, and parent hood.<br />
<br />
The main character, Hina, and her adopted father Nitta develop a healthy relationship throughout the series- Nitta learns of how much a child can change your life, and Hina learns that the world doesn&#039;t revolve around her. Anzu&#039;s character arc explores how lives can be influenced by surroundings, and things loved ones tell you when you&#039;re young can stick with you forever. And finally Mishima, while her story is substantially more comedic than the others, it still briefly explores growing up, coming to terms with ones place in the world, and how tough the adult world can be.<br />
<br />
All the characters, main and secondary, are interesting, memorable, and each have their fair share of hilarious moments. By the end of the series, you&#039;ll no doubt love the characters and really sympathise with their troubles. While I&#039;m not particularly in the position to comment on the themes of life and growing up, I can certainly respect the maturity these ideas are handled with, and I can definitely respect the brilliant humour sprinkled within. Truly a pinnacle in comedy slice of life anime!

    Hinamatsuri comes off as a jumbled mess that doesn&#039;t really know what it wants to be. <br />
<br />
the first episode set me up to this action, sci-fi, adventure to find out the origins of Hina and what she wanted with Earth and how her being under the care of this Yakuza member would change both of their lives, and it all went down hill from there. <br />
<br />
as the show progresses, it seems like more of those initial characteristics drop off in favor or a vanilla, saccharine slice of life with one dimensional characters. all the characters lack meaningful depth and replaced it with one noted shticks,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review299068">
        which made it hard to really connect to anyone. the only arc that actually caught some of my attention was Anzu&#039;s homelessness arc, because at least that added to motivation for her character.<br />
<br />
a lot of the jokes were a miss for me, but there was an effort to entertain the viewer through the wacky hijinks that everyone experiences. <br />
<br />
overall, I was really disappointed with the show and I feel like it would&#039;ve benefitted from another draft to square away what kind of show it wanted to be.

Sometimes you are better off leaving your expectations low and not getting enraptured into something too quickly. For someone that has watched a lot of television and film, I still haven’t broken the habit of brushing my cynicism aside when I see something exceptionally well made. Whether it be the first episode of Kill la Kill, which is vibrant, eccentric, and perfectly paced, or the hook in Nichijou, as we witness a well-known anime cliché get upturned in its opening sequence, setting lofty expectations for the series. The point here is, when a show gives you everything in its opening, you either buy into

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282750">
        it or don’t. It shapes the future of the product for the viewer. Next time you sit down to consume an anime, try and pay attention to the way it attempts to hook you. How does that introduction affect your outlook on the rest of the episode?<br />
<br />
            Hinamatsuri fits snuggly with the “load-blowers” of the industry; clearly wanting to showcase an especially impressive fight sequence that was not only exceptionally animated but solidly funny as well.  A sporadic, nimble cut filled with substantial smears and smooth frames. It instantly captured me. Unfortunately, it peaked right then, for nothing else in the series reached that level of entertainment. I can’t help but feel as though I would’ve enjoyed it more if my expectations weren’t taken through a proverbial lap dance only to get a high-heel to the nads.<br />
<br />
            That’s not to say that Hinamatsuri is bad. It just doesn’t really attempt to be anything it established past the first episode. We meet Nitta, a Yakuza member who finds a metallic pod in his home with an odd girl trapped at the center of it. That girl is Hina. Her origins are unknown. We do quickly figure out she’s a bit of deadpan brat with telekinetic powers. From there, Nitta proceeds to unwillingly take care of her in continuously absurd situations as he makes use of her powers, her naivete, and their general relationship stays at a comfortable medium between hating each other and genuinely loving each other. <br />
<br />
	Hinamatsuri proceeds to introduce a decent secondary cast. A second, power-infused girl with Anzu, who gets left in our strange world as she tries to make ends meet with a bunch of homeless men, and Mishima, a classmate of Hina who gets thrust into a bartending job while still in elementary school. The idea here is that every character must face a situation firmly out of their comfort zone. Nitta, who is somewhat of a lady’s man and rogue, living alone in his apartment, is forced to become a pseudo-parent. Anzu needs to learn about this alien world and survive. Mishima must adapt to the new job she was burdened with. Each one has a miniature arc and plenty of B-stories. Some work, others resoundingly don’t. <br />
<br />
	The show is at its best when it is shooting the shit. Mishima is constantly the most entertaining character, not because she’s well-written, mind you, but simply because the situations she’s put in are farcical and almost always comedy-oriented. Meanwhile, Anzu, who is stuck living with homeless people, must go through a less-funny and more saccharine arc, as she deals with loss and growth. Her arc is perhaps the show at its weakest, as I found myself cringing at the overly-sugary emotions that were not only undeserved but completely dissonant from the appeal of the series to me. <br />
<br />
	Hina and Nitta are well-balanced enough. One moment they hate each other, another moment they have a connection. It isn’t perfect, but it is serviceable. With above-average animation for TV anime, Hinamatsuri elevates its presentation just enough to retain my interest. Unfortunately, the character designs are boring, to put it kindly. If I were in a worse mood I’d easily call them flat-out ugly. This doesn’t do too much to detract from the series, however, the generally serviceable animation, when compared to other shows of its ilk, is truly the only stand-out element in the presentation. Everything else in Hinamatsuri, from directing to shot-composition is uninspired, to say the least. <br />
<br />
	Peaking so early didn’t do it any favors, either, as the initial spectacle wears off and we get what I can only call a slightly above average slice of life. The comedy here is passable for anime, a medium which seriously struggles to be funny on its best day. The characters are generally unmemorable barring a few situations they find themselves in. Particularly earlier on the series before the character dynamics began feeling repetitive. There were flashes of inspiration in the general malaise, what with Hina begging Nitta to go to a “girl’s club”, and Mishima’s journey through unwilling student to a professional bartender. It was a positive experience, if only barely. I see copious praise for a series that does the bare minimum to stand-out from the crowd, but honestly, for a medium that loves repetition so much, maybe that’s enough. <br />

    Just so that we are clear: Nitta thought Hina was a dude, even though he had a full-frontal look at her unclothed body.<br />
<br />
……seems legit.<br />
<br />
Anime comedies never seem to tickle my “funny bone” the way The Simpsons did in its heyday (circa 1991-1999).  While there are notable exceptions (i.e. One Punch Man and Gintama), the vast majority fall under the zany category of school-aged hijinks.  To distinguish itself from the heard, Hinamatsuri throws in girls with psychic powers, who, for the most part, use them to generate obscure situations for the purposes of setting up the proverbial punch line.  And while a handful

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281841">
        of the joke’s secure a half-smile-to-a-grin, nothing resonates enough with the viewer to burst out into laughter over.  In fact, I would wager that my expression resembled Hina’s blank face when I watch this particular anime.  <br />
<br />
The funniest jokes, in my estimation, are the one’s that have a modicum of relevance to one’s own life experiences.  In animation, this begins by creating a character that embodies a distinguishable characteristic that is shared by most people (e.g. laziness), allowing the audience to live vicariously through them.  If the audience feels disconnected from the experiences of the character’s on the screen, their actions come off as being ridiculous, and, god forbid, “cartoonish.”  To exemplify this point, juxtapose a typical Adam Sandler movie with a comedy classic, The Big Lebowski.  In the former’s case, we have situational character’s who fit a particular mold to tell a particular joke, usually to the point of exhaustion.  Whereas, with Lebowski, we have three character’s who epitomize the human condition, that being: laziness, anger, and awkwardness.  Thus, allowing the comedy to sprout naturally from the essence of the character’s themselves, rather than being forced through nonsensical happenstances — as is the case for Hinamatsuri.<br />
<br />
Hina, to the detriment of the series, is a vacuous character with little-to-no remorse for her discourteousness, and only the slightest inclination of empathy.  She doesn’t sound like a typical school girl to me, she sounds more like a sociopath, but that’s none of my business (slurps Lipton tea).  Her unassuming lifestyle parallels that of an annoying, adolescent child, making her behavior all the more irksome; consequently, her immaturity extinguishes the impact of her “comedic” moments. The singular moment where her deadpan personality did serve a purpose, was to set up the final joke in episode 8 (when Nitta celebrates being a “free” man again — now that was hilarious!).  That aside, her monotonous, imbecilic behavior was simply excessive to the point of infuriating the viewer.  We get it, she’s ceaselessly hungry, it’s not cute when a three-year-old says it, and it’s certainly not cute or funny when Hina says it.<br />
<br />
I’m not really sure what to make of the homeless scenes with Anzu (there’s some feels there, I suppose) and the bar scenes with Hitomi.  They, you know, happen, because……the anime staff’s gotta fill 12 episodes?  Also, how come Anzu’s hair/appearance never looked disheveled when she was homeless?  It literally takes a day for anyone to look like utter garbage without the proper bathroom “essentials.”  Just saying.<br />
<br />
Despite my “harsh” criticisms, its not an awful anime, its just not really good, either.  It offers a specific brand of comedy that may appeal to a cohort of the anime community; nevertheless, its staying power is substantially limited, due to the inane nature of the show.  If you have roughly 4.5 hours to kill (who am I kidding, I know you do) then give it a go, it may be a source of great enjoyment and copious laughter — but, if you’re like me, it will be fairly jejune.

    TLDR: Hina is a fun and bubbly anime which focuses on unique experiences in unique circumstances. It&#039;s a funny side watch that doesn&#039;t focus on the sci-fi tag, but centralises on the interactions of random individuals. You&#039;re at the right place if you want a nice watch that will brighten your day, even if it&#039;s by a little. <br />
<br />
Scores~ Story [7] Art [6] Sound [6] Character [8] Enjoyment [8] Overall [7]<br />
<br />
Story [7]<br />
Hinamatsuri&#039;s story isn&#039;t spectacular, but something that develops at a nice pace and is enjoyable. While the anime doesn&#039;t particularly explain the context of the story (pre-Hina appearance), any need for this closure is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279199">
        washed away as you are immersed in the interactions within the series. <br />
You want to see how the blank Hina (character) acts and grows, how Anzu works her way through life and how the characters interact, develop and react to each other. It&#039;s not a large metaphoric story, but a collection of stories; a good slice of life story.<br />
As a result, the interesting and everchanging development, combined with its comedic tone, make Hinamatsuri&#039;s story enjoyable. <br />
<br />
*And to those expecting the explosions of sci-fi/magic, be prepared to be disappointed as this anime doesn&#039;t particularly focus on this aspect and is more of just a drive for the plot. <br />
<br />
Art [6]<br />
Nothing much of note here. While the drawings are quite consistent throughout the series so far, the art doesn&#039;t particularly stand out at in any major way and can feel a bit dated for 2018. It does a good job characterising the temperaments of the characters and that&#039;s all that is needed of an adaption. Not yet mediocre but not quite great either.  <br />
<br />
Sound [6]<br />
Similar things can be said here, as with art. The OP and ending tracks are good, but it isn&#039;t much of a step over fair. The voice acting is consistent, solid and set the tone for every character making them fun to follow. Again, the sound is not great, but not mediocre either, making it a fair attempt.<br />
<br />
Character [8]<br />
Perhaps The series&#039; strength, it really makes it up here by introducing a variety of unforeseen characters into the mix. The interesting attitudes of various characters make us curious to see the how the characters interact and develop. We want them to be together, to talk and to wander aimlessly into conversations. <br />
It keeps it fresh and entertaining as we move through the episodes. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment [8]<br />
I can&#039;t help but be fixated on the interactions of Hina (character), and perhaps that is my fault (I&#039;m a sucker for the clueless). As such as a shot from the blue, Hinamatsuri takes &quot;not belonging&quot; to a unique level as it shoots various situations into the mix, making it really enjoyable. I want to see what happens next, what happened after that and after that. <br />
Hinamatsuri keeps it fresh and the unknowing chemistry is keeping me pinned to this show.<br />
<br />
Overall [7]<br />
Even though this isn&#039;t a top quality production digitally (art and sound), the characters and story within the show drag the quality back up and make this a very worthwhile watch. Through its left-field characters and the chemistry they develop off of one another, Hinamatsuri leaves you wanting for more as it keeps it fresh and interesting within it&#039;s cute, yet mature, world.<br />
<br />
P.S<br />
&quot;Don&#039;t you dare break that vase&quot; they said...<br />
&quot;I&#039;ll disown you&quot; they said<br />

    This Spring 2018 season, we are given sequels of popular shows that ever aired on the anime community. From My Hero Academia 3, Tokyo Ghoul:re, Steins;Gate 0, High School DxD Hero to SAO Alternative GGO (even tho its a spin-off). Then we are blessed with Romantic-comedy segmented shows like Wotakoi, Tada-kun and 3D-Kanojo Girl. Of course this are not the only anime the aired this season. There are countless of them as well as leftovers from the last season which is Winter 2018. However, despite of many choices of anime to watch, there is one lacking the season without this genre. The &quot;Comedy&quot; genre. Sure,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281861">
        we have rom-coms all over the place but that doesn&#039;t stop me for hoping a show that will air this season that is pure comedy. Not only comedy, but some drama as well that can make my or our hearts feels warmth. And I am glad I stumbled upon Hinamatsuri (Or Hina Festival).<br />
<br />
The story of Hinamatsuri is quite simple. You have a young psychic girl named Hina got transported in a form of a weird-metallic capsule to the apartment of a yakuza named Nitta. This two relationship servers one of the primary comedic acts of the show. We have Nitta who doesnt want to adopt Hina but leaves him no choice to adopt her because of her powers. Thus, this embarks the journey of Hina and Nitta, from parenting to just silliness.<br />
Comedic anime revolves mainly on the characters for the story. And Hinamatsuri&#039;s characters are well-developed with their own unique attributes. For example, Hina&#039;s attitude on the show is very unique unlike any other main protagonist on comedy anime. She is dumb, boring, annoying in the eyes of Nitta, spoiled and has a very unique voice that really reflects her personality. Although this personalities are very bad, in the show, it is just fun. She is what she is and we viewers enjoy how boring she can get through episode. Whether or not she tries her best to fit to Nitta&#039;s apartment, there will still be laughter on our faces. The chemistry of Hina and Nitta being on one scene is priceless enough to make you laugh. Her boredom plus Nitta&#039;s annoyed face are just good. Not to mention the other characters as well like Anzu and Hitomi. This two gave plus points on this show. We have Anzu here who was like Hina at the start but due to her having different experience, her character changed. We can compare the two psychics being like one child on a poor family and one child on a rich family. the two&#039;s relationship reflects the real world&#039;s perspective between these two. Then there&#039;s Hitomi who really adds the comedic material to the top. With her being a part-timer but a middle-schooler, who knows that if she is found out, trouble can get her. Thus, this leads to some whacky comedy skits and her faces making us laugh.<br />
The other characters as well supports the genre of this show. From Utako forcing Hitomi, the band boys, the yakuzas, journalist, Hitomi&#039;s Mom. Everyone is part of the show. Everyone have elements of comedy.<br />
<br />
On every anime out there, art style is a must. In Hinamatsuri, its art is one of the things that made it stand out this season. I am not talking about beautiful animations, fight scenes, scenery and all. I am talking about there facial reaction. The art of the facial reaction of the characters are splendid. It makes anyone giggle or laugh whether it is Hitomi screaming or even any other character with a gloomy face. It is just well-done.<br />
<br />
The openings and endings are quite stunning as well. On the opening, we see every character from Hina to Utako, their possible roles on the upcoming episodes with their visuals. The music is very good along with the visuals as well. Speaking of good music, the ending really stands out for me. With the electric guitar on the beginning showing Hina and Nitta or Nitta only walking through the streetlights are just beautiful. Then seeing the facial expression of Nitta throughout the ending with the male voice are just well-synchronized. They are all good.<br />
<br />
Overall, Hinamatsuri is not that much of a well-known anime this season because of the other anime out there. However, it stands top for me as one of the great anime that came out this season. Its drama and comedy are well fuse up with each other and can either make you laugh or sad (well you feel sad because of only one character) on every episode. I really recommend anyone seeing my review right now to give this anime a go because of its unique intake on comedy and hidden reflections of youth on our generation.
