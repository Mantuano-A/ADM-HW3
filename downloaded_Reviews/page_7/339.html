    Digimon Adventure is a 1999 kids anime show. Twenty years later, it has become a classic so Toei decides to give us - people who most likely watched this show as kids - a huge dose of nostalgia and a beautiful end of story. But, surprisingly, Last Evolution Kizuna is much more than that. It is a movie full of allegory, passion and all kinds of emotions. And definitely far from a kids movie; it is aimed at a mature audience. It is a unique, flawless piece of art that will stay in our Digimon Adventure fans&#039; hearts forever.<br />
<br />
With Taichi and his friends in their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review397352">
        early twenties, Kizuna is the perfect example of a coming of age / growing up movie. You can see them talk about university or job hunting, when some moments later they encounter a powerful, unknown enemy Digimon, Eosmon. Unable to instantly defeat it, they meet Menoa Bellucci; a girl who is a Digimon researcher and offers her help. She tells them that, because they are growing up, their time with their Digimon is limited and that sooner or later their digital partners will disappear. Not spoiling you the rest, but get prepared for a chain of unpredictable events and many meaningful messages.<br />
<br />
The now grown-up characters we loved as kids, show clear character development and are true to their beliefs until the end, especially Yamato and Taichi who are the main protagonists. Daisuke and his gang from Digimon Adventure 02 play a role too, and seeing all the Chosen Children / DigiDestined fight together is pleasing. The main antagonist of the movie is what I would call a well-written villain, or maybe anti-hero, which is a big plus. There is no good and bad guy in this movie, there are just Chosen Children fighting against their own coming of age, each in their own way.<br />
<br />
It is indisputable that Toei Animation put a great effort into this movie, because it is spectacular, full of detail and amazing soundtrack. Starting off with nostalgic &quot;Butter-Fly&quot; and &quot;Brave Heart&quot; to hit us in the feels, with a well-animated battle and beautiful scenery, they make it clear we are going to watch a great movie. As time passes, there is always a different soundtrack playing. It feels like each one is better than the previous one - and they all fit the atmosphere perfectly. The animation is great from beginning to end, the Japanese voice actors did an amazing job so it is inarguably a great audiovisual experience. Special credits to Natsuki Hanae (Taichi), Yoshimasa Hosoya (Yamato) and our guest star Daisuke Ono whose addition was a pleasant surprise to the Digimon world.<br />
<br />
Closing the review, I would like to note that Last Evolution Kizuna is not only for Digimon Adventure fans, but for all audiences. That&#039;s because it is not a typical Digimon work and it holds special meaning for everyone. Its theme is something everyone can relate to, therefore I highly recommend it to all of you reading.<br />
<br />
Thank you!

       After being majorly let down by Digimon Tri, the Adventure series seems to have been given one last chance (maybe? And a new remake/spinoff in April?) to go out with a bang. Though it seems like the Adventure series has and will be milked like a Dairymon (there is surprisingly no cow Digimon to make this joke work) for the time being, this film does actually live up to its title and thankfully concludes with a level finality while also calling back to many of the things that made us fall in love with the franchise all those years ago. <br />
<br />
 

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330248">
         The film strikes a nice balance between telling a new story to wrap things up while also referencing many classic moments in the series and fanservice without going overboard. The opening scene is a great example of this while also showcasing the best animation of the film. This opening scene was very exciting but unfortunately raises expectations on the visual front a bit higher than the rest of the film is able to manage. After the scene concludes, we&#039;re quickly shown some generic cgi crowd and pedestrian shots and reminded to keep our expectations in check. Overall the films visuals are an upgrade from Tri, though in all honesty that isn&#039;t really saying much. The character art and animation is solid and the designs are definitely an upgrade from what has recently been put out. Unfortunately the main villian Digimon is animated fully in CG and some of the later action, showcased after an extended period of plot and talking suffers from heavy CG use not present earlier in the film. <br />
<br />
   On the character front, it&#039;s great seeing all our favourites grown up and (mostly) achieving their future aspirations. This is also a major theme of the film, and coupled with a plot that directly draws on and even uses the classic child character designs, really brings the story full circle and amps up the nostalgia factor. Additionally, seeing these characters we grew up with drinking alcohol and having their porn stashes found by their digimon (yep) really drives home how many years have passed since seeing these characters for the first time. This nostalgia is likely what most fans are looking for in a film like this, and on this level I feel the film succeeds, and to a much greater degree than Tri. <br />
<br />
   The plot at times felt reminiscent of the first Digimon film to me, with some of the staging of scenes being direct callbacks to the film. The themes of the film focus on loss and acceptance and the power to move on mirrored in both the films antagonist and Taichi and Matt. The film manages to be quite serious at times, with some fairly serious real world stakes both small and grand scale. It&#039;s able to evoke a few really emotional moments and like I hinted at the beginning of the review as well, the film does actually has the guts to live up to its title and for that I commend it. <br />
<br />
   Overall Digimon:Last Evolution is a nice send-off to the series that should certainly satisfy fans in a way Tri didn&#039;t even come close or TRY to (sorry). At this point, I feel like that&#039;s the best Digimon fans could have asked for.

    I am a filthy, dirty digimon fan and have been since I was a kid. I know that inherently, this is probably a bad movie if you aren&#039;t a fan. But is meant for the fans who have been here since the start. I watched the movie first, in &#039;08, then the original adventure, adventure 02 and tamers. This was built for me. I cried, I laughed, I yelled in shock, I shouted about my waifu Kari and my husbando TK. Quality content all around. I enjoyed every minute, and that is in the end, what matters. No matter how high-brow my anime tastes get,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review348815">
        I will always enjoy this. Goodbye, Original Digidestined, and the 02 cast. You made my childhood, and growing up with you was astounding.

    I was incredibly disappointed by digimon tri. I didn&#039;t have high hopes for Last evolution kizuna going on, but I was blown away.<br />
<br />
The art is amazing and the battles are actually good, for possibly the first time in digimon adventure. The music is almost perfect and the the other audio is great. I can&#039;t really fault this at all. <br />
<br />
I am a little unsure how this syncs up with the adventure 02 epilog but I can&#039;t blame the movie for that.<br />
<br />
I grew up with digimon and have been an avid fan from the beginning. This is the first time in nearly 20 years I feel

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350458">
        like the characters were handled with appropriate care. They show their growth from the show, they interact with eachother in believable ways, and throughout it all I felt like the movie was saying goodbye to fans in just the same way the characters are having to say goodbye to eachother. There is a new digimon airing now, but we don&#039;t have to worry about recons or character resets anymore. The characters we grew up with completed their journey and are continue to &quot;keep moving forward&quot;, and I think that&#039;s a pretty perfect final message to leave us with.

    I might be a little bit more biased in my review as Digimon has been my childhood and i remember being a little kid finding episodes on early youtube back in 2010. After the last installment of the digimon tri series I was left a little disappointed but not wanting to accept the fact that my childhood series had completed tricking myself into thinking the series was good despite it being decent at best. After watching digimon kizuna, i was left crying at the end realising this was it. Its over. The plot story overall was very well constructed focusing primarily our two main protagonist

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345746">
        Taichi and Yamato or in the english dub Tai and Matt. However characters from the original series do appear throughout the movie including characters (including digimon) from digimon adventures 2 which starred Davis and co. The music and sounds are all nostalgic and bring out memories of digimon from the past in the early 2000s while reusing some soundtracks from the tri series making it pretty well thoughtout by the producers. Only reason its an 8 and not a 10 was because no digi rap unfortunately. The art was amazing fitting for the time <br />
(2020 animation) and the cgi was very barely noticeable with only a few scenes making it obvious. The story is very focused on the characters and the overall plot rather then digimon fights making this movie all the more sentimental for long time digimon fans. If you decided to continue watching this while skipping the tri series thats also ok as the story doesnt really include anything from it while focusing on the characters and what happens. I really hope there will be another installment of the original digimon series but from how this movie concluded this is probably the finale.<br />
<br />
TL:DR:<br />
Final movie of the original digimon series, must watch and very sentimental for long time fans such as myself and a massive improvement from the digimon tri series.<br />
<br />
P.S: sorry for any spelling errors, typing this on my phone as i just finished watching it and crying about 10 minutes ago

    I really don&#039;t understand why there&#039;s so many reviews praising this to high heavens. But I will chip in for the first time to share my thoughts on why I don&#039;t think this is an amazing &quot;final&quot; installment in the saga.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll get this out of the way as everyone else does: I&#039;ve been a fan of Digimon since I was a smol boi. Though granted, I didn&#039;t get to see them until about 2005. And certainly well after I became a fan of Pokemon.~<br />
But that&#039;s beside the point. Basically, I love the heck out of Digimon despite its failures and faults, and have been for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354837">
        a long time. (Can&#039;t even help but have some merch and games, including the actual V-pet)<br />
So let&#039;s dive into it<br />
<br />
Digimon: Last Evolution Kizuna feels like a dead horse we&#039;ve already beat once or twice before. The main driving force of the plot (the point of contention/villain/dark force) ironically feels like it was an idea stolen from Summer Wars, but with a twist. In fact, the movie from the start felt like it was trying to be the climax of Summer Wars&#039; original inspiration, Digimon: Our War Game, while also mildly trying to keep the feel of Digimon tri. (as in, the characters we know being grown up and trying to find themselves). While overall an interesting enough idea, it doesn&#039;t feel too epic or like the villain is that big a threat since we know exactly what&#039;s going to happen. There&#039;s too much plot armor and predictability, and it is revealed/resolved too quickly. (Funny enough too, while I didn&#039;t particularly like Summer Wars, at least this aspect was handled better in that movie)<br />
As far as the message and making Digimon go away because you grow up...well, it seems a bit contrived just so there&#039;d be a sense of finality. It&#039;s understandable for them to do this, but it feels like they didn&#039;t make it feel very impactful.<br />
<br />
And actually, that&#039;s my main problem with the movie. There&#039;s not enough buildup and payoff. At least in Digimon tri., I actually felt something. That series somehow hammered in the finality of losing the Digimon pretty dang hard. Say what you will about tri., but there was more to it than there was here. Certainly more development and heart. At the end of tri. (and in fact, even once or twice more in the earlier parts because of certain Digimon probably dying) I bawled so hard I thought my eyes would fall out. But not here. I&#039;m so baffled at how anti-climactic and lacking in feels the ending was. Taichi and Yamato did have a bit of a cute moment, but there wasn&#039;t much to it. They cried, but there wasn&#039;t any room for us to cry with them. Maybe because we&#039;re supposed to understand the nature of the parting and say &quot;well it&#039;s understandable, now you can go make your life and live, you&#039;re all grown up now. *pats on head*&quot;<br />
*sigh*<br />
<br />
Overall, the animation is good, the action is cool as always, there&#039;s some nice callbacks to earlier memorable Digimon moments of the past to pull it all full-circle. Even showing the digidestined as their younger selves and all. (And there&#039;s digimon! Though to be honest, they didn&#039;t focus all too heavily on them compared to tri. /sadface) I do like that you really get to see the original cast all grown up and doing adult things like drinking and having their porn stashes, etc. (yeah that happened, haha) We&#039;re not quite sure what path the main two, Taichi and Yamato are headed in, but we know they&#039;ll figure it out now they aren&#039;t stuck in the past. It&#039;s just a shame that didn&#039;t feel too impactful, we just kind of accept that it happened.<br />
Maybe the way you take this movie depends on you. Perhaps I am stuck in the past and unwilling to let go, which is why I expected it to make an effort to pull at my heartstrings like it should. But that&#039;s not quite what happened. It was final for sure, but not final *enough*. But, in a way I feel at the very least content that some of my childhood heroes I grew up with found themselves in this crazy world in the end.

    Kizuna is a deeply personal insult to people who grew up enjoying Digimon and still feel enough lingering affection for it that they would watch Kizuna after the atrocity that Tri was. It is not merely worse than Tri was: it is one of the worst, most mean-spirited, most VILE movies I&#039;ve ever seen, period. While Tri was ultimately about how &quot;growing up&quot; means casting aside childish things—a conclusion it seems to abruptly pivots away from because that long series was unpopular—Kizuna is about how enjoying childish things as an adult makes you a psychopath. This review could only contain spoilers for the entire thing.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370876">
        been fuming for the last 30 minutes trying to figure out where to start this, pacing back and forth through my apartment, fuming and suppressing the urge to scream out of consideration for my neighbors. Because, unlike with Tri, I am definitely in the minority when it comes to hating Kizuna. So I think starting on a positive note would be best, like Kizuna does. The battle that opens the movie has good choreography and it animated quite well. It&#039;s almost a direct apology for some of the sins of Tri, which was barely animated most of the time and had horrid fights.<br />
<br />
However, that opening fight is also meaningless. The fact that the DigiDestined occasionally fight Digimon in the real world is never relevant or even mentioned again. Indeed, this is so disconnected from the rest of the story that it pretty much underscores the fact that you DO NOT have to watch Tri to understand Kizuna. It is only referenced when Mei and Meicomon appear on screen for a few seconds. All of the MILLIONS of threads left loose by Tri are completely ignored and one is even blatantly, nonsensically contradicticed by Kizuna later. Which, as a fan, bothers me because why did I sit through that entire series if it was going to be made completely irrelevant by the very next entry. But, equally, as a fan, set me up to enjoy Kizuna more because it immediately signaled that it wasn&#039;t going to get bogged down with opening Tri&#039;s mystery boxes based on Deep Lore nobody gives a damn about. However, this good vibe was not to last.<br />
<br />
The second that that opening fight is over, the movie immediately starts ranting about how Tai and Matt are growing up and growing apart from the group. This was what I was worried about when the trailer proudly announced that this story would threaten to make the DigiDestined lose their Digimon for no other reason than that they &quot;grew up.&quot; When did Digimon become about outgrowing friendships and casting people you love aside for the sake of your own growth? What was the purpose of reuniting the DigiDestined with their Digimon at the beginning of Tri if Tri would then spend the entire rest of the runtime being about how the Digimon didn&#039;t fit into their lives—even exiling the Digimon to the Digital World and giving them amnesia before undoing that? What was the point of Kizuna coming along immediately afterwards to say, definitively, that they must permanently get rid of their Digimon because of non-negotiable natural laws that always existed and nobody ever mentioned &quot;because it&#039;s sad?&quot; The point is that the people behind this story hate telling Digimon stories, and they&#039;re using their artificial monopoly on telling Digimon stories to tell their fans &quot;Fuck you for liking this. Grow up,&quot; where their version of &quot;grow up&quot; is joining the joyless monotony of everyday life. But it takes it even further than that, to outright condemn people for wanting the series to continue to reflect the themes like long-lasting friendship and the power of people&#039;s bonds with each other. Again, Kizuna wants you to know that if you liked those things, you&#039;re psychotic. But we&#039;ll get there.<br />
<br />
So Matt and Tai are shooting the shit in a bar, drinking beers, and being Adults with Adult Problems like deciding what their graduate thesis will be. They have pawned Agumon and Gabumon off on other members of the DigiDestined because they can&#039;t imagine having their Digimon with them while they&#039;re doing Adult Things in Adult Life. While my skin is crawling, someone sitting behind them collapses and goes into a coma. It turns out that that person was a DigiDestined and there is an artificial Digimon that is stealing their consciousnesses and their Digimon for unknown reasons. An American Digimon researcher named Menoa shows up and she knows a lot about the threat posed by this artificial Digimon she has dubbed Eosmon because of a contrived allusion.<br />
<br />
Tai, Matt, TK, and Izzy go with their Digimon go into the internet to confront Eosmon. What follows is a fight scene within the internet that is superficially reminiscent of the end of the first movie, only with way less interesting than that, and notably less interesting than the meaningless fight we just saw. TK and Izzy hardly even participate, instead sitting back while Greymon and Garurumon fuse to become Omegamon because that form has just become a default strategy at this point.<br />
<br />
This is a good time to point out that, No, there are no women present at this battle. Kari and Angewoman participated in the opening fight scene and promptly exited the narrative. Sora&#039;s only role in this is to stare longingly out the window while saying she &quot;decided not to fight.&quot; Mimi is the first member of the original cast to be knocked out by Eosmon, and her predicament serves to further the men&#039;s arc of dealing with the issue on their own. Yolie from 02 appears, and is the one who &quot;pawns off&quot; a contact request from Menoa to Izzy so he can handle it instead of her. Do you see where I&#039;m going with this? This movie&#039;s idea of women growing up is for them to sit back and let men take care of the serious problems, and that is seriously their only &quot;positive&quot; stab at the subject. That aspect of this story only gets worse.<br />
<br />
So Omegamon wipes the floor with Eosmon because that form is Super Badass, but they cannot win because this is the end of the first act. Just before Omegamon can deal the final blow, Omegamon splits in two. Eosmon escapes and the DigiDestined retreat to figure out what&#039;s going on.<br />
<br />
What&#039;s going on is literally just that Matt and Tai have become Adults, and so now their digivices have countdown clocks to the moment when Agumon and Gabumon will disappear forever. Why was this never mentioned before? &quot;Because it&#039;s like how nobody talks about the inevitability of death.&quot; No, really. Jennai—clearly the person from Tri who was merely masquerading as Jennai raised from the dead as a young man (like he also masqueraded as the Digimon Emperor Ken) because he was the primary antagonist of that series and the last Tri movie ends with a sequel hook that establishes that he is definitely still a villain, but Kizuna is ignoring all of that with no explanation—comes out of the Digital World to speak to Tai as a friend. This villain suddenly appears to Tai as a friend in the real world, something we have never seen him do so casually, and tells Tai that he knew this would happen all along. The only reason he didn&#039;t inform them was because he equated it to death. I&#039;m not even going to bother explaining how irresponsible that is. It&#039;s like not telling someone that their dog will die, only their dog is a person with whom they can talk and form a mutual relationship indistinguishable from any other person, so they grow up unprepared for the sudden inevitability of death.  It&#039;s just not a realistic scenario. It&#039;s a constraint invented to suit the vile themes of this movie and serves only to make those themes seem like inevitable natural laws. Only they aren&#039;t. They literally made it up. And their in-universe explanation for why this happens? That&#039;s just the cherry on top of this shitshow. The eventual disappearance of a Digimon is not merely an age thing. Digimon gravitate towards their DigiDestined as children because children have &quot;infinite potential,&quot; and that potential decreases as time goes on and they gain more adult responsibilities. When they become adults in the eyes of this natural law system, their connection is broken and the Digimon disappears. If this WERE an age thing, it would still be offensive and terrible, but the fact that it is NOT an age thing just makes things worse. We&#039;ll get there pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
First, I just want to point out that other Digimon stories have created reasons that Digimon and their DigiDestined partners split up. Tri alone separated partners both by killing off Digimon and also sending them to the Digital World that was then rebooted, wiping the Digimon&#039;s memories. This story about separating Digimon and their partners was stupid then and it is stupid now, because Digimon is about building bonds with people, not breaking them. But AT LEAST those other stories, including Tri, weren&#039;t trying to pass off broken relationships as the result of natural laws that the (few) adults in the room just never talked about. Leomon did not die—specifically in Digimon Tamers—for Kizuna&#039;s bullshit plot contrivance in service of its bullshit story&#039;s bullshit themes.<br />
<br />
Oh, God, but where the fuck was I? While Tai is getting a talk from the character proving how pointedly we are ignoring the events of Tri, Matt basically becomes a secret agent and starts investigating the American Digimon researcher named Menoa and her assistant. Because Eosmon&#039;s coma attack can reach them through their internet-connected smartphones, he buys burner phones for himself, Tai, and Izzy. (By the way, they updated the digivices to be smart phones without a word explaining this and they don&#039;t even bother to do anything with that except make them a vector for Eosmon to hurt them. But the original digivices still exist and they are connected somehow. They did this Because Growing Up Means Modernizing, I guess. Tell that to your gender politics.) So then Matt contacts Ken, Davis, and Cody from 02, who happen to be in New York for unrelated reasons, which happens to be the city where Menoa&#039;s research university is. You were mad, like me, that the 02 kids were teased for appearances in Tri and then ignored for 6 movies in a row? Here&#039;s your begrudging, minimal inclusion. They are gophers checking out a few things for the original team, because they are coincidentally in America at the time. They also have some quick fight scenes connected to the final fight, but they are otherwise uninvolved. This is the Tai and Matt show now.<br />
<br />
Matt&#039;s investigation reveals that Menoa was a DigiDestined and a child prodigy. She lost her &quot;infinite potential&quot; when she went to college at 14 years old. This is the black hole where whatever Kizuna&#039;s theme is supposed to be completely breaks down. <br />
<br />
If Digimon are powered by the DigiDestined&#039;s &quot;infinite potential,&quot; then why did Menoa&#039;s Digimon disappear when she was 14 just because she went to college early? She has every opportunity at that point. We are told she is wicked smart, that she received validation in the form of early college, and she has her whole future ahead of her. We even know that she eventually actually got a research job at a university studying her area of interest, which is next to impossible. In exactly WHAT WAY does Menoa lose her potential at just 14 years old? Not addressed. And it invites us to consider the rest of the main cast by similar metrics.<br />
<br />
Why isn&#039;t Izzy, who runs his own company as an adult, Too Adult to have a Digimon? Why isn&#039;t Mimi, who began supporting herself as an actress during 02 Too Adult to have a Digimon? Why isn&#039;t Sora, who has suddenly decided to not be involved with the fighting because she has dedicated her life to flower arrangements Too Adult to have a Digimon? Why, of the characters we know, does this problem ONLY impact Matt, Tai, and Menoa when they&#039;re about to graduate from university? Well, Joe is a resident at a hospital, so it can&#039;t be tied to school specifically either. The only thing we&#039;re left with is that this natural law that prevents all partnerships between DigiDestined and Digimon from outliving the DigiDestineds&#039; childhood just exists so the creators of this movie can loosely tie the movie to the idea of growing up without actually expanding on what they mean by it. Only the end result of a &quot;heartstring-tugging&quot; &quot;graduation&quot; -esque storyline matters. Nothing about what any of these symbols actually means matters.<br />
<br />
But Matt is satisfied with &quot;Menoa lost her Digimon when she was 14&quot; for some reason, even though it should raise the further question of why the worldwide DigiDestined have never reported their Digimon disappearing before. The main cast was around 10 when they got their Digimon. They are now in their early 20s. If Menoa got her Digimon after them, because of the events of the original series and 02, and lost them within that time, then there is no way she was the only one. This would be an incredibly traumatic experience that would have happened to many people by now, and they absolutely would have heard about it if the DigiDestined community is so close-knit that they meet up and Izzy has a list of every known one.<br />
<br />
For plot progression reasons, Matt becomes suspicious of Menoa&#039;s assistant. He is apparently operating under an alias and hiding his research data according to the 02 kids in America. He confronts the assistant and learns that this man is, in reality, a special agent of the FBI. Yes, that&#039;s right. This fucking cop is a good guy and the DigiDestined will be working with THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIONS. The real villain is Menoa, who contacted them because she wanted to steal their list of the DigiDestined worldwide. (And she worked with them in that initial fight against Eosmon, her creation, because... Don&#039;t Think About It.) When she does this, she steals Izzy&#039;s consciousness like she did Mimi&#039;s, and also Kari and TK&#039;s because they&#039;re not allowed to be part of the narrative anymore. In fact, the only member of the original DigiDestined who is not involved at all in this is Sora, who&#039;s busy looking out her window and holding Biyomon because she chose flower arrangements because she&#039;s a Good Woman, I guess.<br />
<br />
With these names, Menoa changes her hair and gets Crazy Eyes to indicate she&#039;s now Bad. She accelerates her plan to steal the consciousnesses of all the worldwide DigiDestined by infesting the world with Eosmon drones. So it&#039;s about time to talk about WHY she is doing this, right? In-universe, it&#039;s because she&#039;s bitter about the loss of her Digimon and is sending all of the DigiDestined to a place within the Digital World called Neverland. Here, they revert to childhood and may live with their Digimon forever. This is where we Mei and Meicomon from Tri, because they were captured, too.<br />
<br />
Out-of-universe, the reason Menoa is doing this is that she&#039;s a ham-fisted avatar for fans who don&#039;t want the series to change and progress. She is a strawman making people who didn&#039;t like Tri out to be, as I said at the top, psychopaths with Peter Pan complexes. Moreover, this is another nail in this movie&#039;s sexist coffin. Not only is she a Duplicitous Woman Villain in this coming of age story squarely about boys, she is an unreasonable woman character who cannot let go of her childhood. She is infantalized along with every real person she represents, but particularly women. Nothing she does, or Matt and Tai do in response, makes sense outside of this obvious, fan-hating, masturbatory context.<br />
<br />
For one thing, we&#039;re never actually given a reason for why her proposed solution is categorically, universally &quot;bad&quot; aside from the fact that it violates the Natural Order of Things introduced to this 20-year-old series by this fucking movie. It&#039;s clear that she is doing this without the people&#039;s consent, which is wrong, but what she is promising them is eternal life with someone we understand to be their closest friend. It is implied that each pair exists in a separate world that is not connected to the others, but that issue could be rectified immediately by just connecting them. I wouldn&#039;t necessarily want to live in it, but if it meant that I would never be separated from MY CATS I would consider it, let alone if it prevented the disappearance of one of my closest friends. So, what, exactly, would be Wrong with consensually creating an immortal DigiDestined utopia? Never addressed.<br />
<br />
What we get instead is Matt and Tai attacking Menoa because She&#039;s Crazy and she kidnapped their friends and she&#039;s Violating the Natural Order. Tai and Matt, who represent the Adults In The Room now, are then attacked in turn by their friends who have become children. Menoa says that she is not controlling them, and that this is their free will. However, the DigiDestined children are portrayed as mindless specters with red eyes indicating they share, at best, a sinister, Borg-like collective will. Matt and Tai are then literally held back by these children in one of the most on-the-nose shots I&#039;ve ever seen.<br />
<br />
Kizuna is making the argument that Digimon as a series is held back by adult fans&#039; affection for the original series, and that the characters should be allowed to age and grow. It is doing so by weaponizing images of the characters from when those fans liked them best against the new movie creators&#039; vision. In a movie that fans, like me, only came to see because that original version existed 20 years ago. They lured people in to this, took their money, and then spat vacuous insults at them for an hour before blaming those fans for the show&#039;s poor reputation. Maybe, and I&#039;m just spitballing here, Tri was a fucking awful series that wasted time for three years without resolving anything. Maybe it has nothing to do with a Peter Pan complex, and they just didn&#039;t like what you made. Maybe, even if you thought Tri was good, you don&#039;t have to make a whole sequel movie equating people who didn&#039;t like it to someone who is so bitter that she&#039;s lost her mind, in which you also ignore the entire plot of Tri.<br />
<br />
I just don&#039;t understand the point of stories like this. Do they think that children are completely sub-human and incapable of discerning between good shows and bad shows, let alone good morals and bad morals? As if it&#039;s impossible to re-evaluate a show as an adult and still enjoy it. Do they think kids&#039; cartoons aren&#039;t made BY ADULTS, somehow? Including, this time, themselves? Because they sure as fuck stamped this story with all kinds of (vague) messaging about the Proper Roles of people in society as if this was a story written By (Boring) Adults, For (Boring) Adults. They expected people who enjoyed the older series to pay for the privilege of being called immature psychopaths, and bring their kids along for the ride.<br />
<br />
But, Christ, how else would this shitshow end but with Matt and Tai restoring the children to their proper ages and destroying Neverland. Menoa is arrested by the FBI because, I cannot stress this enough, part of growing up is APPARENTLY working with AMERICAN COPS. We get scenes with Tai and Agumon, and Matt and Gabumon, that I&#039;ll talk about. But, otherwise, the movie ends with nothing resolved or changed about the other characters because they were barely characters in this to begin with. Kizuna was the Matt and Tai show to the bitter end. In order to defeat Menoa, they even unlock a brand new &quot;Last Evolution&quot; for Agumon and Gabumon that represents the fact that they have accepted Adulthood. And neither these new forms, nor the fight itself, even looked good.<br />
<br />
But wait one fucking second, you piece of shit: If the Digimon get weaker as their partners get older and lose their &quot;infinite potential,&quot; then why is the resolution of this movie that two people who are about to lose their Digimon because they are now Adults *without potential* unlock new and more powerful forms for their Digimon? Why does Matt and Tai losing their potential, their Digimon&#039;s power source, make their Digimon stronger by unlocking a new digivolution? Because this movie isn&#039;t interested in making any fucking sense. It is only interested in preaching its bullshit ideas about what &quot;growing up&quot; means. But it&#039;s so uninterested in saying anything cogent about &quot;growing up&quot; that it doesn&#039;t even bother to explain how &quot;growing up&quot; is GOOD when it means losing this infinite potential that children have to empower Digimon. <br />
<br />
I mean, even Beyond how little this movie says about what &quot;growing up&quot; means and how firmly it believes in strict roles for adults, including the diminished place of women in Adult society, it doesn&#039;t even bother to explain the most obvious thing. Where do the vanished Digimon go after their DigiDestined partner becomes an adult? It equates this to death, which is absolute nonsense as I said before. But, sure, let&#039;s take that at face value. Digimon death has been explored in previous Digimon series. We know exactly what happens. They are reincarnated as Digi-Eggs. They sometimes retain all of their memories of previous lives. Originally, DigiDestined had to go to the Digital World to be paired with Digimon and Digimon could not leave outside special circumstances, so were there just generations of humans living in the Digital World and becoming adults such that this process would be well-known to the Jennai Imposter? NO. DEFINITELY NO. WE MET MEMBERS OF THE *ORIGINAL* DIGIDESTINED IN TRI, and they were, generously, in their 30s. Even if time is weird in the Digital World, there&#039;s NO WAY that this has been a well-documented occurrence because not all of the Original DigiDestined&#039;s Digimon SURVIVED to their adulthood, and we may surmise that they left the Digital World and their Digimon behind before they became adults. If they did remain together, why weren&#039;t Digimon introduced to the real world sooner than the climax of the first Digimon Adventure show? Does that imply the opposite assumption, that some of them stayed in the Digital World until they were adults? If so, then what happened to them after they became Adults? Did they return to the real world? Did they remain in the Digital World without their Digimon? If they&#039;re still in the Digital World, what happened to them when the Digital World was rebooted during Tri and the Digimons&#039; memories were erased? It raises so many fucking questions that will never be answered because they didn&#039;t bother to think beyond the confines of this horrible story&#039;s horrible message.<br />
<br />
Aside from those considerations, which I admit edge towards fan wank, we definitely DO know that the Digimon reincarnation process can be interrupted by dying in the real world. This is one known way they may die permanently. If the end of their partnership means that a Digimon dies, then why the FUCK did they not work out a way to return Agumon and Gabumon to the Digital World, so they could be reincarnated via a process we have already seen? There is no reason. What about the fact that we saw all of them, at the end of Digimon Adventure 02, living with their Digimon as adults? There is no reason that was ignored. They just wanted to end this movie with an allusion to Angel Beats, with Tai and Matt crying over the deaths of their Digimon because that means it&#039;s time to grow up.<br />
<br />
This parting is allegedly supposed to be a good thing for them, according to the internal logic of the movie, but which is depicted as a tragedy in a desperate attempt to make people feel something. Apparently, it worked, because this garbage is overwhelmingly popular and people felt like it had something relevant to say to them. In my estimation, fans of Kizuna have also accepted the lie that the world can only get worse. People who believe in the ideology of this movie voluntarily place themselves beyond help and stand in the way of other people who are still willing to do the work to make things improve.<br />
<br />
This movie is not deep. It is reductive in the extreme for the sake of its hopelessness. It is preying on the indoctrination people are constantly assaulted with that Adult Life means becoming like everybody else and going through the motions dictated by a society that will brook no dissent. If you do not comply, you reject the Natural Order of Things and are detestable. Should I even bother to respond to such a toxic idea? People do not need to be shackled by the dogmatic expectations of society. People are allowed to still like shows that they liked when they were kids, especially when those shows were as thoughtful as Digimon Adventure was. For that matter, Adults are still allowed to like childish things and engage with them in whatever way that they want to. The only thing that&#039;s inappropriate here is the Kizuna team leveraging Digimon Adventure to give the middle finger to fans when those fans can&#039;t even respond by making a Digimon Adventure story themselves.<br />
<br />
I just honestly hate living in a world where it&#039;s in vogue to revive things people enjoyed when they were kids just to remind them that their lives suck now. It&#039;s such a betrayal and an abuse of power. Imagine if we lived in a world where people who actually enjoy stories were allowed to write sequels to those stories. Imagine if our stories and cultural heritage weren&#039;t monopolized by joyless creeps who are only interested in using that power to spread their fucking hyper-conformist, sexist, depressing, &quot;conservative,&quot; &quot;realistic&quot; propaganda.<br />
<br />
Abolish copyright. Abolish whoever is responsible for the last several years of Digimon content. Abolish weebs who are willing to drink piss like this then spend the rest of their lives hyping it up to get other people to drink piss.<br />
<br />
This movie made me feel my first emotion in months that wasn&#039;t directly connected to the ongoing COVID pandemic, and that emotion was Blinding, Unyielding Rage. Digimon Last Evolution Kizuna is the worst movie—in concept AND execution—that I&#039;ve seen since The Last Jedi, for many reasons similar to The Last Jedi. I&#039;m not gonna say it&#039;s *worse* than The Last Jedi because I was actually able to finish Kizuna. But that&#039;s the only reason. And is that really an accomplishment on their part if I watched the last third of Kizuna at 4x speed and it still felt plodding? I would have sped it up even more, but VLC cuts off the audio after that point. So I learned one new thing out of this fresh reminder that I live in a Joyless Hell with people who revel in living in a Joyless Hell.

    Last Evolution Kizuna is a tremendous comeback from the adequate but disappointing Digimon Adventure Tri. With a tight and well execute story, backed by a strong emotional narrative core, this movie is a fitting conclusion to the Digimon Adventure series.<br />
<br />
Last Evolution Kizuna is a prime example of how a story can really dig deep into the emotional impact of both its themes and narrative. Fundamentally, it is about the question of growing up, what that means and how we deal with it. the Digimon partners of our characters in many ways symbolizes their childhood or connection to it. This is made clear without ever being

        explicitly stated with the characters noting how little their partners change and how they find it hard to accommodate them in their adult lives. This clarity without having characters unnaturally spell out the narrative ideas they are going for speaks to the confidence the creators had in their story.<br />
<br />
While the plot in isolation itself is nothing spectacular, the emotional resonance the story achieves despite this really demonstrates how having a concrete vision can overcome minor failings. There are fairly clumsy red-hearings in the plot and a number of contrivances which a less well executed movie would have viewers zeroing in on. The power and clarity of the emotional point the movie makes more than makes up for this, sweeping aside these issues. Even if the main antagonist is relatively uninspired, the emotional conflict at hand is potent enough to carry it from just being adequate to something truly engaging.<br />
<br />
Some might argue that this is simply taking advantage of the nostalgia viewers have when entering this film. While this is clearly in part true, as this movie is meant to be conclusion to a beloved and long running series, the movie does this in all the right ways. It takes advantage of the emotional attachment to characters to further its narrative instead of using it as a crutch to string viewers along. Last Evolution knows it is powerful because it is an ending to a story where its character do not want it to end either. Nostalgia and the pre-existing connection are utilized as part of its emotional core instead of as a substitution for one. As a movie meant to build off everything that has come before it, it would be unfair to review it while attempting to strip it of the nostalgia and prior connection. These elements are integral to the story they are telling instead of being just ancillary attractors.<br />
<br />
In fact, Last Evolution feels like it earned even more call backs than were placed in. This is in part due to its concentration and focus on just Taichi and Yamato which makes for a much clearer and streamlined story. Despite that, the show does justice to its remaining members of the cast. Something that Digimon Tri. failed to do despite its much longer duration. It feels like Last Evolution could justify a slightly longer runtime than its relatively short 1.5 hr duration. It is a testament to the strength of their emotional narrative that Last Evolution feels lacking in the length of its call backs and other nostalgic elements that do not necessarily service the plot.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, Last Evolution is example of how a powerful story and idea can be carried out well, eclipsing the minor blemishes it may have. While it would not nearly be as powerful for some who is watching Digimon for the fist time, its themes are still universal to anyone who has or is experiencing the transition to being an adult. It commits to this fully by having our ending be bittersweet, as hinted at by the title. It is definitely something that anyone with a connection to the original Digimon Adventure or 02 should watch.

    Digimon Adventure Last Evolution Kizuna is a great movie for Digimon Adventure fans, specially those that, like me, were disappointed with Digimon Adventure Tri. Tri was a bit of a mess, with rushed and unexplained plot points and the spread out movie format was not a good idea imo. Last Evolution Kizuna feels like a much more coesive movie.<br />
<br />
The art is great, with well animated batlles albeit a bit excessive use of CGI and the soundtrack is a huge throwback to the original series. It was really emotional hearing the original version of Butter-Fly playing at the begginning of the movie, about 5 years after

          <span style="display: none;" id="review355809">
        the singer sadly passed away. They also did a great job at making constant throwbacks to the original series like with the digivolution sequences.<br />
<br />
The story is really interesting and they did a great job with the antagonist this time around, with their motivation and goal being relatable. I won&#039;t get into  spoilers, but the backstory of the antagonist was really sad and makes them a lot more interesting.<br />
The amount of time the characters were shown was a bit inconsistent, but I feel that&#039;s alright. Sora for example barely showed up, while Mimi and Joe were present for a few minutes. The spotlight was really into Taichi and Yamato, while Koshirou, Takeru and Hikari had major supporting roles, specially Koshirou. Digimon Adventure 02 cast also showed up, which was great. This unbalanced distribution of roles was welcome tho, as it matches the characters&#039; circumstances in their life.<br />
<br />
The one thing I did not appreciate was how the finale was open ended-ish. Wheter it&#039;s a bad ending or a good ending, I prefer if they deicide to show it and properly explain it, but it feels like the writers were scared to disappoint and tried to appeal to everyone. Chronologically the movie takes place before the finale of Digimon Adventure 02 so you can take your own conclusions as to what exactly happened at the end, but it still leaves a huge bitter-sweet feeling after watching the movie.<br />
<br />
Finnally, I want to admit that this movie is not perfect in the sense that there is some recognizable amount of plot armour and maybe the plot was even a bit rushed, but to me personally the enjoyment was not affected. It really feels like this movie was made for the fans that grew up watching Digimon Adventure years ago, and seeing the main theme of the movie of having to grow up and move forward with your life is quite relatable. It managed to make me feel anxiety, pain and emptiness, all while watching the movie and in the aftermath as well, so I think it definitely did its job.

    As a long time fan since the series has come out (watched it when it first came out on tv) I was very excited to hear another movie was coming out after Digimon Tri was over.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the excitement has been pretty much destroyed. I appreciated the movie following our two main Characters, Taichi and Yamato, but I feel it was rather rushed.<br />
<br />
To make is short, the story was bland and very predictable, they backtracked on a few things like not being able to have a partner digimon when you are older (Digimon Savers proves otherwise). I feel like this will just be considered non canon

          <span style="display: none;" id="review352773">
        and remember tri as it was amazing and definitely worth watching.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d recommend watching Tri as it follows them being older but with more development<br />
<br />

    Heavy spoiler warning.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s only one big problem with this film. Sadly, it&#039;s a very big one.<br />
<br />
While The main protagonists refer to Neverland as &quot;an old memory&quot;, it appears in practice to be a (very real) literal eternity of happiness, barring the next crisis, that admittedly might happen, disrupting it (though there&#039;s still an army of Eosmon to work with for dealing with that).<br />
<br />
While kidnapping people is bad, Menoa was kind of in the position of stopping someone from committing suicide, and she clearly reached out to some of them (even that one girl was on her phone when she collapsed, interesting given that is implied

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369608">
        to be Eosmon&#039;s normal method of transportation).<br />
<br />
My problem, of course, is that Taichi and the others are not only the villains of this film, but frequently oblivious assholes, mainly to an antagonist who did nothing wrong.<br />
<br />
Growing up is fine, but is it worth it if you don&#039;t have what you really want? I think not. But they don&#039;t even act like there&#039;s an alternative (admittedly, they don&#039;t know about it until they do, but then they do).<br />
<br />
Some smaller things (good and bad, but mostly bad):<br />
The final forms of Agumon and Gabumon are based on different stages. Why is that?<br />
<br />
Menoa is supposed to be American, but her flashback(s) near the end show her and Morphomon speaking Japanese.<br />
<br />
My unreliable sources tell me that Menoa was meant to be sympathetic, to contrast the pure evil antagonists of Adventure classic. If so, they went to far, and ironically repeated something from Digimon Adventure (if anyone remembers the Gekomon arc).<br />
<br />
Eosmon bears similarities to Gizumon, which is funny because they can be considered Digimon savers.<br />
<br />
Hikari&#039;s old attire was a clever way to bring the whistle into the scene, but blowing it working is even worse than miracle lights powered by the audience. Okay, it might not be that bad.

    This is what Tri should have been a love letter to the whole Adventure franchise (yes even S2 and S1/2 Movies gets included this time) Its a must watch for all Digimon Adventure fans!<br />
I had big expectations when I saw that the S2 cast would get an actual role this time around (Veemon is my favorite Digimon) and I was not disapointed. While I will not mention anything from the plot I will just be listing what I enjoyed from the movie. Though I will be making a slight comment on something some people might consider a spoiler  n the &quot;Overall Section so just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review360582">
        beware.<br />
<br />
Story: Like the titel says its a final farewell (unless they decide to make a 25/30th anniversary movie) to our beloved friends from Adventure. With the movie having a high focus on Tai and Agumon, Yamato and Gabumon relationship with the rest of the S1 cast being busy with adult responebilities, but the S2 cast (including Hikari and Takeru) cast having an avtive role this time.<br />
<br />
Art: Its great for a Digimon movie but ok for an anime movie, you can see were they put thier effort around to make the movie nice. But its not something that will take the enjoyment out of the movie<br />
<br />
Sound: Perfect. They were using all the different themes from the series through the movie. With a new version of &quot;Butterfly&quot; appering in the intro<br />
<br />
Character: I can´t say much its a movie about growing up, and myself being in the same age group as the cast it hit hard as I can relate to what they were feeling.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Like I said earlier, Its a love letter to all of adventure. I was smiling whenever I saw the S2 cast around, or spotted a cameo. I was glued to the screen the whole time.<br />
<br />
<br />
SMALL SPOILER IN THE &quot;OVERALL SECTION&quot; BELOW REGARDING A SMALL DETAIL IN THE MOVIE. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: Is it the perfect anime movie?, probably not. But it is a good send off to the Original Digimon franchise for now (As there are still 17 years from Last Evolution to the ending in S2 so who knows if they will return again after a couple of years, like what happened with the Tri movies)  So if you enjoyed S1 and S2 you will most likely enjoy this movie aswell. And If you after having watched the movie like me was a litte confused there is an interview with the producer of the movie confirming that the S2 ending is still canon and that the characters will get to that ending

    If there’s any show that can really get me with those childhood feels, its Digimon. I started watching the series when I was four from VCDs. The Filipino English dub I watched was kinda bad, but the action was great, musical was memorable, and the story was fantastic. It was one of the first kids cartoons I watched that took mature topics seriously, handling things like death, adoption, family drama and growing up in a blunt and accessible way for younger children.<br />
<br />
The first Digimon series: Digimon Adventure however after three seasons (the last of questionable quality) is apparently ending with this final instalment of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357602">
        franchise. There are some flaws but overall, as a lifelong fan, if this is truly the end I’m satisfied. It’s a good send off to some of my favourite characters.<br />
<br />
Our heroes, the Digi-destined are now in college. They’re figuring out future plans and following their dreams, with the exception of our two MCs Tai and Matt who are have no idea of what they’ll do after graduation but there’s always one thing that doesn’t change, battling Digimon with their Digimon partners… until it does. It is revealed that children lose their Digimon as they start to grow up. The clock is soon to reach 12 and digivolving makes it go faster. While this is happening, several digi-destined are also falling into a coma. It’s up to our heroes to deal with this new threat while also dealing with the impending loss of their lifelong friends.<br />
<br />
The plot is simple, but this means it takes little time to explain and can move at a good pace. It steadily flows between mystery, drama and action in the way that feels natural. It was especially fun to watch the 02 characters investigating with their Digimon and when the heavier scenes came on, you can definitely feel it.<br />
<br />
<br />
It should also be noted that Kizuna is very much the Tai and Matt show, which is definitely disappointing for those that are fans of the other digi-destined who are very much side characters. There’re moments were you really feel that more screen time should be dedicated to them especially since the conflict is one that they’ll all have to face. Sora in particular is hinted to be undergoing an interesting arc but she ends up having the least amount of screen time of all of them. Even the 02 characters, who were heavily advertised after not appearing in Digimon Adventure Tri, while having great moments are ultimately there to serve to main narrative of Matt and Tai.<br />
<br />
With that being said though, I think this was for the best. Digimon Adventure counting 02, has 12 kids and 12 Digimon: 24 main characters plus any additional friends and foes. The series had two seasons, 50+ episodes each to develop them all, this movie has less than two hours. It makes sense to focus on just the leader and the lancer and honestly, this is some of the best development Tai and Matt have had.<br />
<br />
When I was a kid, I looked up to Tai and Matt. I was a nerdy kid, so I always saw myself as more like Izzy or Joe, with Tai and Matt being the cool big leaders. With this movie though, I could relate to them more than ever. I recently graduated from university and that feeling of having no clue what to do while everyone else around you seems to be making leaps of progress is one I know all too well.<br />
<br />
The two have grown a lot since the old days. A problem I had with Tri was that it tried to bring back the old Tai/Matt rivalry but over inane and contrived reasoning that made both characters seem inept. Here, they act much like how friends their age would, they banter, they jab, Tai’s more easy going, Matt still got his chilled bad boy streak but it’s more down to earth and that’s cool to see. They’ve matured a lot since the days of fighting in the snow. Also, seeing them drink beer and looking at porn is just fun. More importantly: when Tai and Matt face the despair of losing their digimon, it hurts. It’s not just that they’re losing their friends; an entire part of their lives is being ripped away and the movie makes sure you every second of feel it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Much like us, the chosen children have grown up their entire lives with Digimon and going into an already unknown future without them creates a palpable sense of desperation and sorrow with even comedic scenes having at least of slight sense of unease. Despite a usually fast pace a lot of time is dedicated to Tai, Matt, their digimon and others just digesting the news of disappearing digimon and how it affects them: from denial, to despair to eventually accepting it so that they can do what’s right and save their friends.<br />
<br />
The dynamic between Tai and Matt and their digimon is what makes this. In the original show most of the Digimon didn’t really have proper character development. They were cool pets that liked to eat and play while occasionally gave some sound advice to their kid, but they mostly served to help said kid’s development more than getting their own. This isn’t bad as ultimately the kids are the central players in the series but it’s particularly interesting here. Kizuna makes a point that the Digimon don’t really change as their partners get older. They’re ultimately the same lovable monsters through and through. This however does not make them stupid or one-dimensional; they’re simple but also wise in their simplicity. Agumon and Gabumon despite knowing what might happen simply decide to keep being with their partners; eating, playing, just generally hanging out like nothing has changed. They accept what might happen to them and understand that their kids are ready to go on without them. They’ve loved their time together and watching them grow into the people they’ve become. It’s melancholy but warm at the same time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can’t really talk about the next few bits with spoiling the film, so here’s your warning:<br />
<br />
The main villain Menoa Bellucci has been accused of being a rip off of Tri’s villain, Maki. While it’s true that their motivations are very similar, she’s also a lot better written than Maki. Tri in general was bogged down by trying to balance out over complicated lore and teen drama. Here it’s more direct, Menoa was a child genius that lost her Digimon partner because she grew up too fast, now she wants to adduct other digi-destined and place them in a dreamlike digital dimension, so they don’t lose theirs. It understandable and sympathetic for both the characters and the audience without requiring extensive background information. She’s not a super in-depth Shakespearean villain but she serves the plot well and drives the main theme of loss and moving on.<br />
<br />
The final scene of Agumon and Gabumon disappearing is quiet and unexpected. They’re having a casual chat with their partners and then gone. Some may say its underwhelming but that’s kinda how change is, you don’t realise it happened until after it does. The reactions afterwards however do sell it, they knew it was coming but it was still heart-breaking. I really love how the conversation starts with Agumon commenting on how big Tai’s gotten. They were almost the same height back in the adventure and now Agumon barely gets to his waist. Tai’s a man now, he’s a gotta look forward even if it means he gotta endure the pain of losing his best friend.<br />
<br />
Finally, let’s talk about that theme. A lot of people really don’t like that the film says you just have to accept giving up the Digimon, particularly if it’s seen as a metaphor for giving up childhood which for many, Digimon is a huge part of. I don’t really see it that way though. Right before Menoa is defeated she sees her partner Digimon, who states she was always with her. I don’t think the Digimon truly leave but rather they still exist inside their human, continuing to be with them albeit in another form. I don’t think it’s saying that you need to give up on childhood past times like Digimon but rather that it is inevitable that when we grow up, these series end and how we perceive them changes. That doesn’t mean we have to give them up or that they no longer exist to us but rather they do in different ways like memories, nostalgia and of course newer entries into the franchise. Digimon changed a lot since I was young, I can’t enjoy the franchise with exactly the same wonder I did back then, but the lessons it taught me and the characters I’ve come to love, I still carry with me to this day.<br />
<br />
Spoilers end:<br />
<br />
Digimon adventure recently got rebooted with a new series. It’s really fun even if it’s a bit different and I’m glad the series can continue to entertain new kids. If this is really the last we get of the OG cast (which very well may not be the case if there’s enough money to be made) then I’m satisfied. There have been ups and downs on this adventure but I loved it all the same and, in my opinion, it ended on a high note.<br />
<br />
Till we meet again, Digital Monsters.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS – didn’t know where to put this in but Agumon and Gabumon’s new evolutions look kinda dumb. I really don’t like the humanoid designs wearing the traditional dragon/wolf armour, it looks way too unnatural from the previous evolutions. They’re not on screen long enough for it to be a big deal but yeah, it looked dumb.

    im writing this review as someone who had watched digimon since she was 8/9 years old and now she is 20 and still a big fan of the digimon adventure serie .<br />
sorry if you found a lot of faults and Spelling errors cause english is not my native language.<br />
i watched the tri films and loved it, this film is great too .I had scattered feelings;<br />
At first I was Extremely happy and joyful because finally the heroes of my favorite anime, which were almost my age when I was little,Here, I am currently watching a series of them when they are in their teenage years and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415627">
        They are going through the same problems, feelings and difficulties that I am going through now, and anyone may feel this about their way to adulthood.<br />
When I finished the old anime series (digimon adventure + digimon adventure02)I started crying and said why? Why didn&#039;t I stayed a child? I was happy at that time with no worries neither overthinking as if I entered their world  ,living with them in their adventures and fun .And this new series didn&#039;t fail to make me feel again like I truly belonged to them and they shared their feelings with me<br />
Taichi and some of the other characters were repeating a sentence that they want to remain a child and reject the current world, but with time we notice that they transcend their flaws and in some way we notice a beautiful development in their personalities and overcome their flaws until they become, as we say, a mature person.The path to maturity is complex and difficult(i am so much related to this this time now), and this is what It was focused on a lot here.<br />
The genre of anime changed and became psychological and has many moments of depression to the point that sometimes after each episode I need to take a break.it  is like this because it is talking about what we feel ang go through as teenagers(puberty really is shit ) As if it was addressed to us, especially us the old Digimon lovers(and especially me), as a message to help us grow and tell us, dear, do you feel bad? Do you feel that you are going through the worst time of your life? Do you feel lost? Don&#039;t worry, your lovable characters that you whatched them when you were little feel just like you. Don&#039;t worry and don&#039;t be afraid what you feel is a normal thing ,you should understand that like what the characters did in the digimon world and you will get over it like they did it. no one understands you? We will be the one who understands you.(i really felt this It gave me a strong sense of affiliation and belonging ,A form of comfort , overcoming turbulent feelings ,overcoming the feeling of being lost)<br />
This maked me feel very comfortable And my happiness is indescribable that they kept the same song of opening, the endings ,the ost ect.<br />
thanks to everyone who worked on digimon.

    Looking at the movie objectively, overall I think they Toei Animation did a better job with Last Evolution Kizuna compared to the Tri series. However, the animation they started off with didn&#039;t hold up towards the end and you can really see the CG in the villain. The story mostly focuses on Taichi and Yamato which was a let down in its own ways, but the amount of detail they put into Taichi and Yamato&#039;s story makes up for it. If you haven&#039;t watched tri or adventures, you still can start with the movie. You do miss a lot of the back story and small

          <span style="display: none;" id="review359593">
        references made in the movie, but that doesn&#039;t prevent people from enjoying it. Overall if I was someone that has not seen any of  Digimon Adventures or Tri, I&#039;d give this movie like a 7. <br />
<br />
Now as someone that watched all of Digimon Adventure and Tri, I can really say that I&#039;m really satisfied with how this movie played out besides the fact that the animation didn&#039;t hold up through out the movie and we didn&#039;t really get to see most of the Adventure 1 &amp; 2 crew. For me personally this was very nostalgic to  watch because I was watching Adventures 1 &amp; 2 while I was basically in elementry school and now I&#039;m watching this movie as college student. Like I was feeling it seeing all the connections that they made to the past films and Tv show. I can forsurly say that watching this as someone who grew up with along side these characters gives this movie a whole different experience. It&#039;s like watching Endgame without watching  any of the other marvel movies, there&#039;s just not as much build up to it.<br />
Regardless of some personal wants for how the movie could of went, I&#039;d give it an overall 9. This Digimon movie really captured the point where we have grown up and have started a new Adventure just like the digidestined.

    WARNING! This won&#039;t be a long review(i know my people)!<br />
<br />
Last Evolution is basically a 20y ani movie to wrap things up(even though it doesn&#039;t wrap up anything)<br />
<br />
If you are a person like many of us who is often hit HARD by nostalgia and doesn&#039;t like sad endings, then you have two choices:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A)Prepare for your heart being torn apart or don&#039;t even watch it if you cannot take it<br />
<br />
B)Consider 02 ending a CANON sequel and then you can be left with a really cool and heartaching experience<br />
<br />
We basically have the whole story revolving around Yamato,Taichi and company getting older (losing their unlimited potential)and  because of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review359124">
        that losing their Digimon partners.<br />
<br />
***Villain is really relatable in terms of you can understand why he would go so far for his goal.<br />
<br />
***Music was epic with ofc original Digimon Adventure OST, and really good OST in the final battle that i don&#039;t think appeared in the original.<br />
<br />
***Characters other than Yamato and Taichi were nonimportant (except Koshiro and 02 crew a little) and Sora was done the dirtiest i don&#039;t know for what reason,but she was already going through what Yamato and Taichi have gone through in the movie.<br />
<br />
***Studio and its producers really don&#039;t get Digimon fanbase as in they think we need to move on from this story(like DigiDestined from their Digimons) and that&#039;s<br />
NOT TRUE AT ALL!!!!!<br />
<br />
We just want to enjoy the series that changed us and touched us like almost nothing ever before and after. We just want to enjoy their adventures, listen to best OSTs ever and SMILE, NOT CRY! We are older now, we are not living in the past, we know that there is a real world and real problems to face onward, we don&#039;t need Digimon franchise to tell us that, just give us joy that you gave us for 20 freaking years !!!<br />
<br />
****FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO KNOW HOW THE MOVIE ENDS AND HOW TO STOP THEIR SUFFERING A BIT****<br />
<br />
Gabumon and Agumon vanish while talking with Yamato and Taichi while asking &quot;what are you gonna do tomorrow&quot;, later in the credits we see that every other Digimon from the original crew vanished, and some time later Yamato and Taichi are seen looking in the sky and Taichi running forward while both saying something along the lines of &quot;Just wait, we will see each other again for sure&quot;.<br />
And that&#039;s where 02 kicks in with its ending, as we all have seen that they have kids with their own digimon(the kids AND the original crew), which implies that they found a way to get back together.<br />
Also there is a new Digivolution of Agumon and Gabumon in the final battle which implied imo that they still possess UNLIMITED POTENTIAL(which was the reason why Digimon disappeared)<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading :) DIGIMON FTW!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />

    This is a good movie but a very mediocre finale. This movie is supposed to be the final ending to the digimon adventure but it does an extremely bad job at being a good farewell, I really would have appreciated if they simply made a 12 or 24 episode season and developed every character in a way better manner and ended their story in a better satisfying way. <br />
 <br />
I think the art style of the movie is phenomenal. The animation is surprisingly very very good, they stayed true to the original designs and made the characters truly look like their older version from the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356006">
        first season.<br />
<br />
The character designs are also simply just stellar. They look exactly as you would expect them to look, the outfits they are wearing fits their personalities and they actually fixed Matt&#039;s hair to look like his original self which is thankfully great. This movie destroys Tri and any other digimon adventure season as far as character designs are concerned. <br />
<br />
I think the story feels very rushed and is poorly executed at times some of the main characters hardly do anything and one of the main three characters Sora does absolutely nothing in the entire movie she is hardly even shown. The story felt pretty good and quite emotional but they just rushed it without properly giving every character a great moment and screen time and that just ruined it quite a bit for me.<br />
<br />
Overall I enjoyed the movie but I simply think it a very rushed end. I still recommend every digimon fan to check it out it is still worth watching.

    Digimon has a special place in my heart :3 I litterelly grew up with these characters, i’m actually the same age as Taichi and Yamato are in Last Evolution now :D And like them, i don’t really have a clear path/idea of where my life’s gonna end up. Seeing the Digi-destined grow up before my very eyes, and realizing that means i’ve grown up too really made me question “what does it mean to be grown up?”<br />
<br />
I loved all the callbacks and easter eggs from older Digimon series and movies. My favorite callback was Agumon’s digivolution scene, seeing the original digivolution sequence that used to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396190">
        be with a Digivice that had a cell-phone like antenna now with a smartphone Digivice was a great combination of nostalgia and looking to the future<br />
<br />
Was very happy to see the 02 Digi-destined again, they had some of the funniest scenes in the movie imo, but the funniest scene goes to Taichi and Agumon, when he invites Agumon over to his own house, lets say they didn’t hold back in this movie to show the Digi-destined are all grown up 😁<br />
<br />
As much as this movie made me laugh my ass off, it also made me cry my eyes out, i was probably crying just as much as the characters were on screen 😭<br />
<br />
The only minus for me is, i wish it would’ve been longer! I’m not ready to grow up 😭<br />

    This hit me really hard. I just recently parted ways with my two best friends whom I loved like family and still do and it feels like as time passes, we keep growing further apart from each other.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m a big fan of Digimon and I feel like this was a great finale to the Adventure series. After the Tri, which was a bit lackluster, this was a great step up. Even though I would have liked to hear Butterfly play at the end, I think the current ending theme is a better choise to go with theme of moving on and not staying in the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357351">
        past.<br />
<br />
Overall one of the best movies I&#039;ve watched and one of the most memorable series I&#039;ve seen.

A mature digi-adventure film, the surprisingly enjoyable tribute to the older audience that grew up with the series. <br />

Music [10/10]<br />
I do not know if there is a written rule regarding anime reviews, but it seems out of place to comment on the music first when analyzing an animation film. However this movie’s soundtrack is the reason why I have such high praise. Some scenes where the music would begin to kick in and I would catch myself saying aloud “yo this shits fucken banging”. Clearly the composers and directors were on the same vision of immersing the

        viewers in the scene. Tracks like: “Wirepuller”, “aurora” and “attack!” coupled with variants of classic themes such as “kizuna”, “bolero” and “brave heart” hit their target, with the aim of getting the audience absolutely hyped for the clash that is unfolding before them. Melancholic pieces like “twilight”, “limited time” and the suspenseful “a battle of the mind” pushes a more mature, anxious mood at the gravity of the situation that the digidestined find themselves in. Yet tracks like “target” (especially the jazz variation of this piece) still captures the cheerful, light hearted, nostalgic theme of the kids running around solving mysteries that we all grew up to love. The music is on point, not just as amusing stand-alone tracks, but an excellent tool of capturing the mood of the scenes.<br />
<br />
Art and Animation [10/10]<br />
Clearly a big budget movie, the animation is smooth and fluid and lives up to cinematic standards. A nod to Toei as they can go hard af and produce stellar action pieces. Slight details are great to catch as well, such as facial expressions (Tai, TK and Kari’s shocked faces in the intro battle as Matt arrives produced a literal LOL moment from me). Another instance, as Menoa is telling her story to Tai as the rain pours outside and the shadow of a raindrop sliding down the window pane moves down her face, producing an image of a teardrop as she tells her plight. All these small details just shows the creativity of the animators adding life to scenes, which the watcher may not catch immediately.<br />
<br />
Yet, the artistic direction seemed to take a minimalist route, which one can see how it plays into the story they tell. No longer do the main characters of the original series wear the vibrant and bold outfits, for them to stand out in a rich and alien setting in the strange digital world. In this film, the main cast wear ordinary clothes in an almost bland, and ordinary urban setting, yet the every scene gushes with luminous, kaleidoscopic colour. Why such a radical change? From the cartoonish kids (with huge hands lol) of the original series, to this more mature, realistic and darker artistic approach, could this may be another way of relaying the message, that the digidestined and the audience that grew up with them are all adults now? Up to the viewer to interpret.<br />
<br />
Story and Themes [7/10]<br />
The simple, non-convoluted story that adheres to the time tested formula of fun mainstream action anime films: problem + big bad persons (additional points if said bad persons has army of mindless minions as cannon fodder) + final battle scene + hype man music + yelling + explosions = fun. Digimon: Last Evolution follows this formula to a tee.  Depressing reality may be the theme of this movie as it is all about saying goodbye to our childhood heroes and moving on as adults, but who said an anime about growing up can’t have explosions? But this is about the second half of the film. The first half is about a mystery surrounding a new discovery regarding digimons and their relationships to their partners that endanger their existence. The hunt for answers as our characters run around has a bit of a detective film noir feel to it (who would’ve thought for a digimon film). As they encircle the source of their predicament, the events begin to raise the stakes, until the plot twist. <br />
<br />
In all, Digimon: Last Evolution is a wonderful way of saying farewell to the OG digimon fandom that has long since grown up, a fitting conclusion to this timeless series. My personal recommendation? Power up those digivices one last time for this “final” adventure and have some fun. This film may not be the home-run classic that will invigorate the franchise, but an enjoyable experience nonetheless. <br />
<br />
Enjoy the digital world, viewer.
