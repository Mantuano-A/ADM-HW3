    Character(s) &amp; Their Development<br />Every character is based with a sterotype near the beginning of the series. The real question though is if the characters actually grow out of their set roles. After watching the whole series that&#039;s both a yes and a no. It all comes down to the fact that the manga is still going and the characters are still maturing in that format; thus, they can only grow so far in the anime without making it a new story entirely. Sure, they stay towards their first impressions but, there are a handful of episodes that explain each Host Club member and their reasoning

          <span style="display: none;" id="review61">
        behind attitude, outlook, and for joining the club in the first place.<br /><br />A keen example is Tamaki and his feelings for Haruhi. In the beginning, he takes on a father role towards her and the audience is made to believe that this is only part of his nature; however, the viewers should realize that this is because of the feelings he holds for her. Even Tamaki doesn&#039;t understand it and in episode twenty-three is forced to question it. He probably can&#039;t comprehend his feelings in the end, but he seems to establish some understanding towards Haruhi. Really, characters do grow but they tend to have done a lot of growing before the show was established, and quite a few past experiences are explained through-out the episodes. Either way, the audience is given the chance to fall in love with the characters before they begin to change, which adds a nice and smooth transition.<br /><br />Animation<br />I&#039;ve found people complain at the lack of the details made towards the characters themselves. Then again, how much detail do you want on a character that&#039;s about to turn chibi on your ass? Seriously, the animators did a wonderful job at finding a keen balance between common and glorious so that when a touching moment is needed, the characters have that necessary lovely animation &amp; while during the hyper-active moments, the characters are bouncy and have a jelly-like movement.<br /><br />One thing that caught my attention after reviewing certain episodes was how detailed the background could be. I hadn&#039;t noticed it on the first run through due to how into the show I was; however, if you pay attention, you really notice how wealthy the animators attempted to make the school look. Look at the ceilings and the inscriptions into it, that&#039;s pretty damn detailed to me.<br /><br />Music<br />I was iffy about the music in the beginning. Once I heard the first line of the opening, Sakura Kiss, I felt the catchiness; however, after listening to the whole thing I wasn&#039;t direly impressed. The ending song, Shissou, I didn&#039;t like at all. It just sounded like normal Japanese rock. I was disappointed even more when I found LAST ALLIANCE was the band who preformed it because they could have done a lot better.<br /><br />Regardless, I gave the music a chance and got a copy of the available soundtracks. While watching the show I found the melody coordinated with many places perfectly, surely in the Ouran world the music full of rich violins, playful piano, and elegant harp was a match made in heaven. In it’s own way everything works... but that ending song.<br /><br />Dubbing/Subbing<br />Since there is no dubbing released, I can&#039;t comment on that; however, the subtitles by Lunar Anime provided on their fansub were wonderfully done. Generally, I don&#039;t like to comment on subtitles because what&#039;s there to say, but what I liked was how many notes were provided to get said joke. It was also produced very nicely for the English audience.<br /><br />Overall<br />Simply, Ouran High School Host Club is just a fun old time. It&#039;s got the wackiness to pull you into a fit of giggles, but at the same time enough character development to move along with a pretty random plot. I was going to skip this series entirely because I tend to avoid popular shows now-a-days; however, in the end I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t. This was certainly worth my time and I guarantee it&#039;s worth yours, too. It&#039;s hard to find a character or a part that you plainly didn&#039;t like. So, unless you&#039;re extremely nit-picky, then there shouldn&#039;t be a problem to enjoy this anime.<br /><br />There are lots of laughs and pretty boys waiting for you at the Host Club so what are you reading this review for?

--The review contains spoilers--<br />
<br />
<br />
Ouran High School is one of the best reverse harem anime series I have watched. The first episode really made an impact. It did not start as to be draggy but rather it easily showed the main idea of the story which started when they have discovered that Haruhi is a girl. The story was quite shallow at first which was just showing the different themes of the club and how they entertained the guests but when you continue with the later part of the series, you&#039;ll realize that behind all the smiles of the characters, there is a bitter past. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4978">
        flow of the story is also good. It starts with the story of a certain character, followed by an episode just for enjoyment, them the story of a certain character and so on which promoted the balanced flow of the story.<br />
<br />
The art of this anime is great since they can convene the different effects for a specific situation correctly. The type of animation used was the traditional type of animation (not the 3D or any modern form of animation) which for me, was better since the traditional type of animation was a type wherein the viewers can interpret more using their own imaginations.<br />
<br />
The opening song Sakura Kiss (which became my favorite) sung by Chieko Kawabe was really fitting for the series since it was lively and the lyrics can really relate to the main character which was Haruhi Fujioka. The ending song Shissou sung by Last Alliance was great in which it blended with the appeal of the club.<br />
<br />
I like the way they treat each other. They treat each other as close friends not some enemy that is to be competed financially or in other aspects (which was the opposite of what their parents really want). Each of the character&#039;s qualities complimented the others that&#039;s why their host club was in harmony. Other characters are also shown who were either supporting or testing the  strength of the bond between the host club members.<br />
<br />
While watching this anime, I might have looked like i was crazy or something coz i kept on laughing out loud everytime there is something really really funny like the thing that happened during their host club ball and the ever-changing characteristic of Tamaki Suou. The &quot;punch lines&quot; and &quot;Labels&quot; also help a lot in expressing the humor of the series like in the part of Kyouya who just recently woke up from bed was placed title as a &quot;Low Blood Pressure Evil Lord&quot; and Haruhi was labeled &quot;Studious Commoner&quot; and the host club&#039;s &quot;DOG&quot; at the very start of the series.<br />
<br />
If you want a lot of laughs mixed with a mixture of romance and a little bit of sadness, or liked boys that are classified as the prince-type, loli-shota type, cool type, devil type or a natural rookie type, then you should watch this anime coz you&#039;ll really enjoy this movie and at the same time understand and appreciate the series as a whole. It&#039;s really great! ^_^

    Looking for a show to laugh your ass off? Look no further, Ouran High School Host Club will not fall short in that aspect.<br />
<br />
All the characters are uniquely lovable. Each person has their own specific traits, and without a doubt, their own problems they need to overcome. Everyone has their favorites too, so within a few episodes you&#039;ll be rooting for one person to get with the other, no doubt. <br />
<br />
Character development and the enjoyment level were the biggest pluses for Ouran. It keeps you entertained nearly the whole way through (except for one or two episodes around 19 or so).<br />
<br />
Only weakness I found was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review40">
        the sound. I didn&#039;t particularly care for either the opening or the ending (though the opening wasn&#039;t all that bad I guess).<br />
<br />
So, in conclusion, it&#039;s almost impossible to not enjoy this show. The ending is great and the lead up to it is very well done. Want to feel good and laugh at the same time, check Ouran out.

    There is a dif­fer­ence between par­ody and what Ouran is doing. Par­ody sug­gests you are mock­ing some­thing, usu­ally in a satir­ical man­ner. Play­ful par­ody is no dif­fer­ent. You are still mak­ing fun of the very thing you are par­ody­ing but say­ing it in such a way that sug­gests you love these faults any­way. This is not what Ouran does. Ouran goes through the pro­cess of abso­lute blatant fan-pandering and the humour is based around the fact that they are point­ing out that they are per­form­ing this fan-pandering. Point­ing out what you are doing is not funny! It’s not par­ody either, it’s still just a con­stant

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27511">
        exer­cise in fan-pandering. I am now writ­ing a sen­tence which I’m using as an example as to how point­ing out what I’m doing isn’t funny. You’re not laugh­ing are you? Good, glad to see you guys have a proper sense of humour.<br />
<br />
This was pretty much my reac­tion through­out the first 10 epis­odes of the show. How­ever I was intent on enjoy­ing this anime. Every­one else seems to love it, what the hell am I miss­ing? Am I really still pre­ju­dice against an anime because it’s try­ing to appeal to women? One method I tried using to change my atti­tude towards the show was the glor­ies of flirt­ing. I love proper flir­ta­tious char­ac­ters like C.C, Horo and Sen­joga­hara instead of the typ­ical moe girl who’s reacts to any pos­sib­il­ity of flirt­ing by blush­ing and hid­ing her eyes under her fringe. When you think about it, Tamaki is the ulti­mate flirt­ing machine. If you solid­i­fied fab­ulous­ness and gave it life, you would get Tamaki. That method didn’t work though and I’m not sure why. Maybe because his flirt­ing was all fake?<br />
<br />
I tried a bunch of dif­fer­ent meth­ods to try change my atti­tude towards the show, each end­ing with a  total fail­ure to enjoy the show. (Incid­ent­ally there were two epis­odes in a row that impressed and I thought I’d stumbled across a mind­set from which to enjoy the show, but the crap epis­ode returned instantly. Look­ing back, the reason was because the two epis­odes focused on the class issue instead of the pretty boys). Even­tu­ally I tried the mind­set of gender­swap­ping. If this was an anime about one poor loser guy find­ing a club of beau­ti­ful women who nearly all fall for him, would my atti­tude towards the show be any dif­fer­ent. Well, yes it would. I would have had a far easier time dis­miss­ing the show as crap instead of spend­ing end­less amounts of time wor­ry­ing that I wasn’t approach­ing the show with the right mindset.<br />
<br />
Please don’t go telling me this is a par­ody. The way Haruhi enters the aban­doned music room the Host Club screams wish ful­fill­ment. You too could find a room full of beau­ti­ful men, all of whom are in love with each other as much as they are in love with them­selves, and hav­ing them attend to you. I didn’t watch this all to the end. I gave up after the epis­ode where Honey hurt his tooth. The epis­ode was set up entirely so they could have homo­erotic scenes between Honey and that big bloke who never talks. They even go so far as to call it pure and utter moe in the show itself. By that stage I had seen enough<br />

    Title: Ouran High School Host Club<br />
<br />
Manga, Anime: Ouran High School Host Club was originally a manga created by Bisco Hatori that began running in Hakusensha&#039;s LaLa magazine on August 5th, 2003, and is still ongoing.  It has been licensed Stateside by Viz Media, and the releases are up to the 10th volume Stateside as of February 5th, 2008, while it currently stands at 12 collected volumes in Japan.  <br />
<br />
Ouran High School Host Club is a twenty-six episode series that was produced by Studio Bones (famous for their work on Darker than BLACK and Fullmetal Alchemist) and directed by Takuya Igarashi (famous for his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4414">
        work on random episodes of Sailor Moon and Darker than Black).  It ran on Japanese television from April 4th to September 26th, 2006.  It has been licensed Stateside by Funimation, though it has yet to actually give a release date.<br />
<br />
Story: Haruhi Fujioka is a scholarship student attending the ultra-wealthy Ouran Academy, so poor that she can&#039;t even afford the uniform.  One day, as she&#039;s trying to find a quiet place to study, she comes across the Third Music Room and the Ouran High School Host Club (if you don&#039;t know what a host club is, it&#039;s basically a bunch of guys flirting with women for profit).  As she&#039;s trying to leave, she breaks a vase worth about $80,000, and is soon employed doing menial tasks to pay off her debt.  Unfortunately, her short hair cut, outfit, and large glasses make her look like a guy, and they soon promote her to host after they figure out she has a lot of potential.  She&#039;s a big hit, and even after they finally figure out that she&#039;s a girl, they have her stay on and conceal her gender, as she&#039;s such a hit, and she can repay her debt faster that way.  Most of the series focuses on the customers and the members of the Host Club.<br />
<br />
Honestly, if it weren&#039;t for the fact that this were a screwball romantic comedy, this would be a fairly standard customer/problem of the week series.  However, it&#039;s because the series does not hesitate to turn its fairly sarcastic sense of humor back on itself that it succeeds so well.  Ouran openly makes fun of several genre tropes of shoujo, and by openly having characters point them out, and breaking the fourth wall while they&#039;re at it, manages to create amazing moments of meta (self-referential moments, for those of you not famliar with fandom terms).  It also has several good running gags that manage not to get old.<br />
<br />
Add to this the fact that every character in the Club gets some kind of development and background (though I do have issue with where this falls, but see Length for more about that), as do minor recurring characters, and you&#039;ve got a fairly solid show.  It&#039;s not anything that&#039;s ZOMG SPEKTAKULAR, but it&#039;s still a pretty good show.<br />
<br />
Art: I really like how Bones did this series.  The lines that are used in the show are a bit thicker than the lines in most anime, which just makes the characters stand out that much more, and are especially effective when they use SD for humor moments.  You can barely tell when CG&#039;s used, and the 2D animation itself is very fluid.  The colors in general are very vibrant, and I actually found myself wondering how they got some of the exact colors that they did (especially Eclair&#039;s eyes), because they were absolutely beautiful.<br />
<br />
Also, a fact that particularly endears this series to my heart is that they had the guy who did the series composition and scripts for Revolutionary Girl Utena doing the same for this (Yoji Enokido), which means that we got a lot of Utena-esque imagery, in how there&#039;s lots and lots of symbolism using mundane objects.  (The only reason I really noticed this was because I&#039;m watching Utena with my school&#039;s anime club at the moment, and I saw a lot of similarities.)<br />
<br />
Music: The background music for this series is extremely exaggerated and over the top, which isn&#039;t that much different from how the entire series is.  I don&#039;t know how it would stand on its own, but in context with the scenes that it&#039;s used in, it&#039;s a perfect combination.<br />
<br />
The OP and the ED are a special case.  They&#039;re the stereotypical female JPop upbeat number and a rousing rock number, respectively, and, in any other series, would not impress me that much.  They do here, though.  And I don&#039;t know WHY.<br />
<br />
Seiyuu: Maaya Sakamoto (famous for her roles as Aeris Gainsborough in FFVII: Advent Children and Hitomi in Escaflowne) plays Haurhi, and Takehito Koyasu (famous for his roles as Touga in Revolutionary Girl Utena and Hotohori in Fushigi Yuugi) makes an appearance here and there as her father.  Otherwise, all the seiyuu managed to capture their characters&#039; qualities perfectly.<br />
<br />
Length: The only problem I have with this series is where they placed background information and character development.  The former came after the latter, and, overall, it probably would have made a lot more sense to reverse the order, and maybe place it more towards the earlier end of the series more than the latter half.<br />
<br />
Overall, though, twenty-six episodes was a solid decision.  I think they could&#039;ve trimmed a few episodes off, but overall, the length was pretty solid.<br />
<br />
Overall: A screwball romantic comedy that&#039;s not afraid to have moments of meta and make fun of itself and its tropes, with excellent seiyuu, art and imagery, and music that fits the moments perfectly.  Could have lost a few episodes and rearranged the order a bit, but hey, it&#039;s still pretty good.<br />

Art: 9/10<br />
Music: 8/10<br />
Seiyuu: 9/10<br />
Length: 8/10<br />

    This is officially the first negative review of Ouran High School Host Club on MAL... which is weird, considering how terrible a show it is.<br />
<br />
Now before all else, let me just say that I&#039;m a guy.  That means I&#039;m MALE, and that this show&#039;s target demographic does not include me.  I am well aware of this fact, and all the more baffled because of it.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m going to skip over the &quot;humor&quot; and the characters and the plot and everything else and go straight for the one thing that made me hate this anime: Ouran is quite possibly the most sexist anime I&#039;ve ever

          <span style="display: none;" id="review24035">
        seen.  It discriminates and bashes on women more than any other show I&#039;ve ever seen, including those stupid slave/maid hentai shows.<br />
<br />
One scene in particular illustrates this very well:<br />
Haruhi sees some of the Host Club&#039;s clients getting bullied by a couple of men, and she stands up to the bullies.  The rest of the Host Club rush to her aid, protect her, and then scold her for taking things into her own hands.  If that weren&#039;t enough, the show villainizes Haruhi afterwards, making it seem as if she did something wrong.  She is forced to (rather, guilt-tripped into) apologize for acting &quot;rashly&quot; (aka &quot;doing something&quot;).<br />
<br />
Why does this happen?<br />
<br />
Oh right, because Haruhi is a woman.  And women are supposed to do nothing but sit around all day at the top of castles and wait for their knights in shining armor to rescue them.  Yeah.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s the VICTORIAN AGE, people.  This is the 21st century.  Here, we have women screaming their lungs off about women&#039;s rights.  There&#039;s women&#039;s suffrage.  Women have been working their asses off for this past century to establish themselves in Americ-<br />
<br />
OH, THAT&#039;S RIGHT.  This was made in JAPAN, the land of the Office Lady and tentacle porno, where women are treated like dirt and paid accordingly.  Apparently, animation companies think they like being treated like dirt.  And with the insane popularity of this series, you&#039;d think women actually feel that way.

    THIS REVIEW HAS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Edit: Even after undropping and completing, this is still a 1/10. No amount of backstory justifies the repeated direct and subtly misogynistic themes and dialogue that exist in Ouran Koukou Host Club. This is not parody. No apologies for a certain spoiler scene I will mention down below, everyone just &#039;forgives-and-forgets&#039;.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Ah where do I start...I don&#039;t understand how this anime is still considered a classic in our modern society. Even though the other MAL comments I read talked about how incredible the development was, the more I watched it, the more my dislike grew for the characters, even Haruhi, who I would

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354495">
        argue is the only sane character in the entire anime (also notably a girl who doesn&#039;t match a gender role). All the male characters said extremely outdated stuff, even by comedic standards (i.e. Tamaki-age doesn&#039;t matter when it comes to romance, paraphrased). <br />
<br />
The first characters I wish I could unsee were the Hitachiin twins and their &quot;brotherly love&quot; act. Like I&#039;m perfectly fine with yaoi and romance in general but NEVER anything that remotely resembles incest/sibling love. And I don&#039;t just feel concerned for the twins, but also the girls that actually are into that kind of stuff...every time I saw or heard them put on their act, both my eyes and ears bled. <br />
<br />
The second character I resent is Tamaki, apparently the favorite MC of Ouran Koukou Host Club. He literally imposes a gender role on Haruhi the ENTIRETY of the 8 episodes I watched in his attempts to get her to fall for him. I don&#039;t know WHY he is so obsessed with her if he intended to completely overwrite her gender bender-type personality and make her more &#039;feminine&#039; but this kind of character actively promotes outdated gender roles that we have spent literal centuries trying to remove. The way Tamaki fantasizes about Haruhi in a dress and in a soft, passive feminine voice and personality is honestly so disturbing to me that I can&#039;t respect him as a person. The final core issue with Tamaki I had was the beach episode where he told Haruhi off for attempting to be a hero despite her gender and explaining how she needed to protected. Just like Haruhi, I felt like Tamaki&#039;s reasons for his anger were extremely misplaced when he could&#039;ve said ANYTHING else. A lot of the comments Haruhi makes throughout the episodes I watched matched my feelings exactly in how weird and disturbing the Host Club members behaved and talked. <br />
<br />
The final nail in the coffin for me was Kyouya. He seems to be the most reasonable and 2nd most sane character in the series but the entire premise of his character is a manipulative person with ill-intent. He literally bribes/motivates the other club members through photoshopped images of Haruhi for his goals of increasing the Ouran HS Host Club&#039;s assets without Haruhi&#039;s consent. I don&#039;t care how much money she owes them but no one gave that guy the right to take Haruhi&#039;s privacy. On top of the garbage fanservice from both the pool AND beach episode, when Kyouya seems to almost rape Haruhi, Haruhi calls him a nice guy??! Look, even if that&#039;s considered an act, that is one of the worst scenes I&#039;ve seen. That not only added another horrible male character to write about in this review and in my opinion, made the only sane character, Haruhi, seem completely out of her mind and ruined her character for me as well. <br />
<br />
The other characters are just weird and I don&#039;t have anything to say about them honestly. I know I am not writing a complete review of the series, but the beach episode (episode 8) was so atrocious, it just made me want to stop watching. The only thing I liked about this anime is their anime opening (absolute meme) and ending song. The art is below average and the story you can read in the synposis, but the point of this review is tell you about some of the worst anime characters I have ever seen in my anime history. <br />
<br />
<br />
Personal Summary and Why I Watched:<br />
<br />
Hi, this is my first review. The only reason why I want to even write one is because of how badly I wanted to drop the anime. Yes, I got recommended this anime by at least 2 people. Yes, I got hyped up and was expecting some funny af rom-com. Yes, I ALSO read the other reviews giving me some hope when I didn&#039;t enjoy the first 4 episodes (rated it 6/10 at that point) when they said the character development was REALLY incredible. Unfortunately, I felt the development of the characters were going downward and I wasn&#039;t liking it. Maybe I should&#039;ve kept watching but after the beach episode but I just gave up on it. I&#039;m sorry to all the people who consider this &#039;classic&#039; their favorite anime, but I just can&#039;t see eye to eye with ya&#039;ll no offense. I have nothing else to say. Peace.

    I would recommend this show even if you aren&#039;t a fan of the romantic comedy genre. It is an incredibly fun show. Even if you aren&#039;t super keen on reverse harem this show doesn&#039;t take itself seriously enough for that to be a major issue. There is of course a fair bit of romance for those of you who are looking for that but for me this was a show that was more comedy than romance. It has a really nice mix of silliness with a touch of sweet.<br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t a show that will blow your mind with art. I found the style a little

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182258">
        dated, but for me that is never really a problem, the poster should give you a good sense of whether it is a problem for you. It is typical shoujo style really, big eyes, lithe framed men. Similarly the music is pretty standard and unremarkable. <br />
<br />
The story I found to be enjoyable. It&#039;s more situational with episodes revolving around their daily antics, until towards the end where things build nicely to what I found to be quite an amusing ending.<br />
<br />
But this is not really a story driven show. It&#039;s a show you watch for the crazy situations, the overblown stereotypes and the ridiculous factor particularly of the male lead. Just on him, he confused me at first because they claimed he was the &quot;prince&quot; type. For those of you unfamiliar with the term it basically describes that perfect guy who is good at everything, has a slim build, super popular and a bit of a charmer. But I found him in reality to be quite different. He is more of a parody of the ridiculousness of that ideal, and kind of an idiot, so in the beginning I didn&#039;t know what to make of him. As time goes on though I really came to enjoy him, he is actually really likable and I like a leading man who you can laugh at. To me that is what makes Ouran Highschool Host Club stand out; the way that it laughs at itself.<br />
<br />
So bottom line? If you like shoujo romcoms or reverse harem this is a must see! If you don&#039;t but you think you are open to watching one this would be the one to watch. If you can&#039;t stand shows about highschool and romance then I wouldn&#039;t watch it but trust me you are missing out!

    I really enjoyed this anime.  More so than a lot of of other stories, it was witty and clever and just that amusing.  It&#039;s one of those animes where *everything* is pointed in the same direction; it&#039;s cohesive and put together like a Swiss watch.<br />
<br />
On an each-episode basis, the story may not be so great... it&#039;s a little erratic.  Some episodes are better than others and I definitely have my favorites and have ones I&#039;ll probably always skip over.  But the whole arc of the story from first episode to last?  Terrific!  And the good parts are so good

          <span style="display: none;" id="review532">
        that it&#039;s easy to tolerate the less-good. ;)<br />
<br />
The characters, despite their flaws, are endearing and incredibly charming (well, with the exception of a few).  You start out with these cutout sterotypes and during the course of the season, each one of them becomes more and more three dimensional.; it&#039;s almost like getting to know a person.  You get past their &amp;quot;type&amp;quot; and into who they are and why and how and their individual strengths and weaknesses... it says a lot about judging a book by its cover.  And that sort of thing sounds like it would be trite and cheesy, I know.  The amazing thing is that it isn&#039;t... or even when it is, it&#039;s still so charming that it&#039;s nice to see.<br />
<br />
The art and music are lavish and rich and perfect for the tone of the show.  Sometimes their faces aren&#039;t so detailed or distinguishable, but I think it goes hand in hand with the basic premise that there&#039;s more going on than just how they look.  Their wealth, which plays a huge part in Haruhi&#039;s (the leading female role) interaction with the host club, is almost like another member of the cast -- marble molding, the reflection of a room on the face of the clock, the immense sprawl of the campus, the rooms, of everything.  I like the bubbly, perky opening and I think it fits the playful tone of the story very, very well.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know if you can tell, but I ***love*** this show.  I love it when Tamaki&#039;s naivete (and I always giggle when he sulks in the corner); I love the nurturing/suffocating bond of the twins; and I love how unflappable and &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; Haruhi is.  <br />

    As a heterosexual male, I am not into girly anime, so when my girlfriend insisted I watched a reverse harem, I instantly thought this will be a soppy, chick flic anime about who know&#039;s what. After watching this anime, I now know how completely and utterly wrong I was. Instead of a perverted anime about 5 guys trying into get in some girl&#039;s pants, it is a comedy filled anime that isn&#039;t centered around the romance aspect of it.<br />
<br />
Story: 9.34/10 *Review<br />
Haruhi Fujioka is a tomboyish, poor female student who enters Ouran Highschool that is populated excessively by the wealthy (besides her). Upon entering the highscool,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review136979">
        she tries finding a quite place to study, and enters the Music Room at the school, to her surprise finds the Ouran Highschool Host Club. After showing disinterest, and as she was about to leave, Haruhi breaks the host club&#039;s precious vase, and to pay back, she must work for them as a member of the Host Coub. *The story is original, and is actually appealing to not only girls, but to anyone looking for a good laugh. It mad me laugh along with the characters, and I even started shipping character&#039;s together (I hope no one finds out I watched this). This anime pacing was great, and the quality of it was better then a few of my favorites. Overall I give it a 9.<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
The art was high quality, the scenery detailed, and the the characters were animated beautifully. All the boys were attractive (I&#039;m straight), and so where the woman. The animation had higher quality than most *cough* Soul Eater *cough*. I give it a 10.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9.56/10 <br />
The voice acting was fluent and the voices fit the character&#039;s personalities very well. I watched this in dubbed and subbed, and I was supprised to hear Vic Morgonoan play Tamaki Suo in the dubbed. He played this part very well and i give him an A+. The opening theme song &quot;Sakura Kiss&quot; was catchy and modern, while the ending didn&#039;t seem to fit that well. Overall I give a very high 9<br />
<br />
Character: 8.23/10<br />
The characters design and personalities are refreshing, and the overall appeal of all the Host Club was great. Haruhie wasn&#039;t an annoying D.I.D (damsel in distress), the twins were hilarious (though it made me uncomraftable to watch them do the twincest thing), and Tamaki was annoying. But it was your good annoying, because that&#039;s his personality and it definitely shown through (lol). The characters were organized very well and it did have lots of character devolpment. 10/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9.41/10 (Oustanding)<br />
I enjoyed this anime, and all of it was great to watch. One thing that bothered me was the parts about &quot;Harhuie in Wonderland&quot; I&#039;m not sure what that was about, but it was diffrent. It reminded me of &quot;Ciel in Wonderland&quot; from Black Butler. Not sure who copied who there. But overall this anime is entertaining and extremely fun to watch. I liked the comedy involved and how it doesn&#039;t completely focus on the romance of two characters. Finally a show not about 2 characters getting it on! <br />
<br />
Overall: 9.75/10 (Oustanding)<br />
After getting over my myself, and sucking up to watch this anime, I am glad I did. Art, characters, sound and story, are good. My girlfriend is glad I enjoyed it, and I get to pick the anime (SAO FTW). While this was out of my comfort zone, I&#039;m glad I watched it and I hope you enjoy it as well.<br />
<br />
TL;DR : Watched a reverse harem and liked it, got brownie points from gf.<br />
<br />

    I had heard about Ouran High School Host Club, I&#039;m guess around last summer. A friend of mine was rabid about it, however, for some reason or another, I didn&#039;t read the manga... Later that summer my other friend also went rabid for it, and again I ignored it.... It wasn&#039;t until I read Kanashimi&#039;s review for it when I decided to watch the seemingly popular show.<br /><br />The story is basically about a student by the name of Haruhi Fujioka who gets into a prestigious school for rich kids, and how she stumbles in on the school&#039;s &quot;Host Club&quot; and ends up having to become a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review141">
        host (and cross-dress) to repay the club for breaking the vase. After this the anime&#039;s story line follows the activities of the club and it&#039;s members.<br /><br />Story -<br /><br />I can&#039;t really think of any really good words for Ouran&#039;s story. However, I found that the first episode had managed to suck me in and I was watching it like a rabid crazy person, just to see what would happen to the characters. Some of the episodes, especially episodes six and thirteen, seemed rather... unimportant, and while I did enjoy them I was ready to go on to the next episode. Also, I found myself slightly unsatisfied with the end, after all when you end something you like a lot, you&#039;re going to want more of it right? <br /><br />Score: 8<br /><br />Animation -<br /><br />Ouran High School Host Club has got some nice animation, and while it&#039;s rare for me to say that any anime has bad animation, I have to say Ouran&#039;s was... okay, you get what I mean. During the first episode when Haruhi was changing, and I saw her reflection in the background, for some reason I was amazed, maybe it was because it was there, or something else, however, it was... yeah. The animation also seemed akin to that of Fruits Basket, I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not the only one who has noticed this, however, at times because of this, my mind referred Hunny to Momiji...<br /><br />Score: 9<br /><br />Sound - <br /><br />I liked the background music... I&#039;m not entirely sure why, but I found it very fitting to the show... The opening theme, &quot;Sakura Kiss&quot; is pretty catchy, and while I do like the song, after episode seven or so, I started to skip listening to it, as for the ending song, I can&#039;t say that I know what it&#039;s called, seeing as the only times I have even bothered to listen to it were when the song was present during the episodes, but it&#039;s not really because I don&#039;t like it, it&#039;s just a habit.<br /><br />The voice acting... Woah.. What can I say? Since Ouran hasn&#039;t been dubbed yet (and why not? Someone please licsense it?), I had to watch it subbed, which is not really something I like to do, however, I really like the Japanese voice acting for Ouran. Haruhi sounded convincingly like a young boy, and all the other voices suited their characters well. <br /><br />Score: 9<br /><br /><br />Characters - <br /><br />Ah. The characters... Well, I found all the main characters likable, and they all managed to leave very distinct impressions of who they were in my mind. Their actions, Tamaki especially, are very fun to watch, and some of them are very easy to picture in my mind, while I know that I haven&#039;t gotten them all covered... It is hard to tell if certain characters actually grow and change a bit, which is why I wish it was longer, however, I suppose that it&#039;s more realistic that way, since people don&#039;t change that fast.<br /><br />Score:  10<br /><br /><br />Overall -<br /><br />I really liked Ouran High School Host Club a lot, so much that it was able to tie itself with my previous number one title, Black Cat, and that I started to look for the manga. I do wish that the series was longer, so I could enjoy the host club more, however it&#039;ll be a miracle if there is another season. And if you&#039;re wondering, if this does get liscensed soon, and I hope it does, I will be buying it.. Though that fact is a bit irrelevant.<br /><br /><br />Yay!: The characters are amazing! Diverse and... amazing. Renge, who I didn&#039;t like in the beginning also started to grow on me.<br /><br />Nay~: Well, I&#039;d say the plot suffered the most, seeing as I wanted more, and well... yeah. It needed more of the host club, and not the one act characters.<br /><br />Score: 9 kitties outta 10.

    If I had to describe it in one word, it&amp;rsquo;ll be this word : PERFECT. <br />
<br />
I had no qualms about it at all. Even Renge became acceptable at the end. I just love the plot, the cute topics per episode. It was done so beautifully. I have to say, whoever made Ouran knew me well. Back then I didn&amp;rsquo;t know there was fan service for girls because I&amp;rsquo;ve never witnessed it before. Now I know there is such a thing! I just love it when the guys go topless! <br />
<br />
Every episode was so great. Every topic was charming and funny, which is what I love

          <span style="display: none;" id="review472">
        about it. My favorite episodes were Hikaru and Haruhi&amp;rsquo;s date. That episode made me squeal so much, but then again, I squeal at almost every episode. Like I said, the creators know me too well. <br />
<br />
The plot was so cleverly crafted. It was so simple and yet it had so much depth. Here we have a girl who was made to act and live like a guy, and she didn&amp;rsquo;t even see it coming &amp;ndash; the same goes for the rest of the host club too. They didn&amp;rsquo;t know a girl like Haruhi would come into their lives (Aren&amp;rsquo;t all Haruhis just great?), and affect them by their interactions with her. Boy, do I wish to be like Haruhi. She inspires me too &amp;ndash; I also dream of being a lawyer someday, that&amp;rsquo;s why I admire her so much. Another thing that I would like to add is that if Haruhi was a guy, I&amp;rsquo;d definitely go after him. I would always forget that Haruhi&amp;rsquo;s a girl sometimes (seems like it was that way for her too).<br />
<br />
I love the other characters too. I&amp;rsquo;ve already mentioned I like Haruhi, but I like everyone else as well (except maybe that stupid &amp;Eacute;clair girl). At first I thought Tamaki was the main man of this show who&amp;rsquo;ll be charming and showy all the time, which would probably make me hate him. Thank God I was wrong, he turned out to be one of the funniest guys in the club and the-go to guy when it comes to comic relief. I love the twins too, I would cheer Hikaru on whenever he wants to make a move on Haruhi, but at the same time I sympathized for Kaoru since he is having a hard time because of all the anxiety in losing his brother, and his &amp;ldquo;jealousy&amp;rdquo; as well since obviously, he likes Haruhi too. Hunny was adorable too &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m not really into shotacon, but he&amp;rsquo;s cute and funny nonetheless. Mori had the least number of lines, but boy is he handsome. Finally, my favorite out of the bunch, ah yes, the cool type &amp;ndash; Kyoya. He is one sexy God, and I love how underhanded he is. <br />
<br />
I even liked some of the supporting characters Haruhi&amp;rsquo;s dad was just awesome and well, pretty. Arai-kun, Haruhi&amp;rsquo;s friend from middle school, was charming as well. Bossa Nova &amp;ndash; kun was kinda funny too. The episode where he was first introduced was one of my favorites, and Nekozawa &amp;ndash; senpai is cool as well. Who knew that underneath the cape he too is a bishonen, just as handsome as Tamaki can be. There are also the lobelia girls, which reminded me of MariMite. I don&amp;rsquo;t really like them, but since they reminded me of one of my favorite series they&amp;rsquo;re acceptable. <br />
<br />
Now for the other stuff. Drawing style was simple, but nice nonetheless. At first I thought it was CLAMP\&#039;s work since Tamaki kinda looked like Fye from TRC, and there was also the tall and stringy look of the characters (plus, there were a lot of bishonens too). It was perfect the way it is, and I think that a more complicated drawing style would overshadow the storyline. The colors were a bit solid and cutesy, but it fit the series wonderfully. I don&amp;rsquo;t think shading and varying colors would&amp;rsquo;ve been suitable. I&amp;rsquo;m just glad the colors didn&amp;rsquo;t clash. I love the details too. I&amp;rsquo;m very critical and observant when it comes to details. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t ignore the wonderful wall and ceiling designs. There were also the shojo frames and flowers that were intricate in design. I think they used a bit of CG on the beautiful chandeliers, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about that. <br />
<br />
The music was another part I liked about it. I&amp;rsquo;ve been into Chieko Kawabe ever since I watched Elfen Lied, so having her on the soundtrack was a plus. Sakura Kiss will definitely be one of my anime song favorites forever. The ending song was also pretty good. I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it at first, probably because I&amp;rsquo;m too busy reflecting about what just happened in a certain episode but after a few episodes it grew on me. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really have time to notice the BGM &amp;ndash; I did at first (I wrote down on my notebook that it was good, so I guess it was good) but after awhile I channeled all my attention to the story. Which rocked, by the way &amp;ndash; can&amp;rsquo;t say that enough. I do vaguely remember a couple of classical music inserts throughout the series, specifically heard when Tamaki plays the piano or during their socials. <br />
<br />
The voice acting was also wonderful. The seiyus matched their characters perfectly, specially the twins&amp;rsquo; seiyus. They added color to the twins&amp;rsquo; antics. Oh yeah, Maaya Sakamoto&amp;rsquo;s definitely my favorite seiyu now. She did such a good job on portraying Haruhi. Kudos to that as well. I did feel sorry for Mori&amp;rsquo;s seiyu, whoever he is. I know he only said &amp;ldquo;ah&amp;rdquo; most of the time, but I still hope he was paid well. <br />
<br />
Maybe the fandom affected me too &amp;ndash; people who barely watch anime talk about it, so I was wondering what was good about it. Finally I got to see for myself, and I really am hooked I&amp;rsquo;m always smiling from ear to ear whenever I&amp;rsquo;m watching it, and I stay that way until after I watch it.. Seriously, this series warms my heart. It&amp;rsquo;s an automatic pick-me-up for me, that&amp;rsquo;s why I love it so much. If I had to pick one series I will watch for the rest of my life, it would be this one, and I might even take it to the other world. FYI, I haven&amp;rsquo;t got enough of it yet. I&amp;rsquo;ll be watching it over and over until I get tired of it ( and that is highly unlikely.)

    On the technical side of things, the animation in Ouran is top-tier for shoujo. Like its characters, this series is spoiled rotten with Studio Bones great animation staff, getting both the pretty design work of shoujo that we expect and fluid A-list animation that we don’t. Every inch of the Barbie Kremlin is immaculately detailed, and the character designs are very…appealing. (SQUEE! ^_^) <br />
<br />
The music in Ouran is all waltzes, ballads and sweeping orchestral pieces, and all that beautiful, dramatic music is used not with reverence, but for satire, and it makes everything so much funnier than in the standard comedy with cartoon jingles. It

          <span style="display: none;" id="review16096">
        also helps to keep the mood uniform when some minor drama surfaces and that same music CAN be used seriously…but just for a second. <br />
<br />
In terms of voicework, I don’t know Japanese, but I’ve heard a lot of comedies in the language, and Ouran has one of the funniest casts of seiyuu in a romantic comedy. It is mind-blowingly funny if you can keep up with it, but even if you can’t, you should at least give the awesome Japanese track a listen at some point. To give your eyes a rest, there’s the dub, which as you may expect, has a LOT to live up to now. I’m not sure they could ever be better than the subbed result. But I am happy to say that they may be just as good, and probably deserve a medal just for pronouncing all the dozens of Japanese words in the show perfectly. Caitlin Glass sounds perfectly tomboyish with just a hint of femininity that has all those hosts in such a hot tizzy, the twins have fairly different voices that make a harmonious blend put together, Kyoya’s delivery is just as sexily serpentine as it should be, and Hunny is sticky sweet syrupy cuteness on a bun-bun, and then there’s Tamaki, the hardest part of them all to play. Now yes, he plays the part a little different from the brilliant Mamoru Miyano, but well, consider the age difference: he’d have to. Still, Vic Mignogna completely works the part in every direction and is absolutely hilarious. Did I forget someone? No, I guess not. (You see, Mori has about four lines in the whole show...)<br />
<br />
So I spent a lot of time elaborating on this show’s fine pedigree because really, that’s most of the appeal. It’s just a filthy-rich, la vida loca slumber-party show and it looks like that party has hung a sign on the door that says “No Boys Allowed.” But let me get serious for a moment and talk about the humor. It can be smart satire, stupid slapstick, or both at the same time, but whatever the case, this is one of the funniest anime I have ever seen, period, and the humor is broad in appeal. <br />
<br />
This show makes fun of anime stereotypes, rich people, moe-crazed fangirls, high school angst, gender differences, just every nerdy and teen-centric topic imaginable and then just settles down for some a good old game of hit the funny French person. Throughout it all, the fourth wall is hardly ever standing. I think if Tex Avery and Chuck Jones had written Saved By the Bell, this would have exploded into being. So on the note of male appeal, I do know some guys who can’t get over the repulsive level of manservice in Ouran, but I also know several guys who move past that and think it’s just as funny as all the girls do. You may just have to test the waters, gentlemen. You are venturing into the wild unknown, but it may well be worth the dip!<br />
<br />
That being said, that still doesn’t make this show anymore than a really good-looking gigglefest, so Ouran decides to completely risk its enjoyment factor in the greatest mistake of all anime comedies: trying to be dramatic. I mean, how in the world is this stupid harem crossdresscapade ever supposed to be taken seriously?<br />
<br />
It works, though.<br />
<br />
Don’t ask me how, but every once in a while, this show starts reaching for your heartstrings, and it almost always works. It may steer too close to corny once or twice, but most of the time it’s incredibly heartwarming, and I think this is 100% due to the likability of the cast. Everyone that watches this show ends up with a favorite host, but there’s not one of the cast that isn’t fun to watch or ever wears out their welcome. Well, except Renge, but she’s an otaku, and we all know how annoying those freaks are. (wink wink, nudge, nudge)<br />
<br />
Still, it really feels like the way I wish my high school had been, complete with belly laughs, happy sighs, and sexy guys. Don’t hate ‘em cause they’re beautiful, just put the fun back in dysfunctional and you will feel no pain as they drive you insane.<br />
<br />
All in all, Ouran is an always-inviting self-parody with just as much heart as glitz, glam, and girly guys. It ranges from smart to stupid all at the same time, is drop-dead hilarious no matter your gender, but of course offers just a little more for the ladies, and does it all with style.<br />

    Charming, comedic, and thoroughly enjoyable.  These three phrases are the perfect descriptors of Ouran High School Host Club, a &amp;quot;romantic&amp;quot; (but it&#039;s not really romance), &amp;quot;high school&amp;quot; (if your high school was also attended by the children of multi-millionaires) comedy that simultaneously pokes fun of at the types of anime that it spawns from as well as crafting an elegant story that stems from that very genre.<br />
<br />
Ouran&#039;s characterization is its strong-point: each individual is an exaggeration of an anime template, taken to its very (il)logical extreme.  You have your lovable caretaker, your brooding mastermind, your &amp;quot;loli shota-type&amp;quot;, a stoic guardian, and a pair

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1575">
        of twins, lost in each other&#039;s world.  Thrown into this multidimensional cast of characters if Fujioka Haruhi, an independent spirit, who doesn&#039;t fit in with the throngs of rich kids (not that she cares to), due to her &amp;quot;commoner&amp;quot; origins.  Together, they are the &amp;quot;Host Club&amp;quot;, paying hired attention to the captivated ladies who have entirely too much time and money that fill the ranks of the Ouran Academy.  As the series progresses, you discover the backgrounds behind each of the main characters, and how they came to be what they are today.  In addition, you witness the numerous escapades of Suou Tamaki, leader of the Host Club, always guiding the hosts forward towards ever-increasing extravagance.<br />
<br />
The brilliantly-crafted characters mesh together to create an image of the &amp;quot;day-to-day&amp;quot; activities of the students at the Ouran Academy.  While the primary setting of the story is a high school, almost no academic schooling of any type occurs throughout the series - the focus is squarely upon the activities of the Host Club.  Whether it be an excursion to some tourist location, an intrusion into Haruhi&#039;s &amp;quot;common&amp;quot; life, or a flashback into the pasts of one or more of the characters, the story never feels forced or artificial.  The course of events flow naturally, the flashbacks coincide with events in the present day that share a common lesson with the events preceding it.  And, above all else, the comedy is omnipresent and ludicrously fitting the moment, the crown example being Tamaki&#039;s Inner Mind Theater, which shows the twistedly exaggerated thoughts going through Tamaki&#039;s mind in reaction to something happening.<br />
<br />
There are, however, a few negatives with respect to the story.  In particular, the plot seems to linger along during the middle part of the series, after the introductions of the individual characters are done, but before the series really gets started with their backgrounds and flashbacks.  These episodes could probably have been condensed, or somehow made to fit with the character backgrounds in order to supply more development time for the thrilling concluding arc of the anime.<br />
<br />
From a technical perspective, Ouran also delivers.  The soundtrack is soothing when it needs to be, reminiscent when it needs to be, and powerful as well, when it needs to be.  Between the smooth melodic background piano to the rumbling guitar intro to the ending theme, Ouran&#039;s music certainly fits the mood.  The sound effects themselves are also natural and expected.  You will get used to the sound of flower petals blowing the breeze, as well as the lifting and setting down of countless tea cups.  Visually, the style in Ouran is unique, especially with its stylized facial expressions.  However, the art style does seem to be lacking at times, in that it occasionally fails to convey the full power of the emotions behind a scene.  In particular, while each of the individual facial expressions are well-done, there seems to be too few of them, at least too few to match the needs of the series at large.  However, this is but a small problem in the grand scheme of things, and should not deter anyone more watching this excellent series.<br />
<br />
So if you&#039;re tired of the ordinary, or just want to laugh endlessly at the oftentimes formulaic aspects of characterization and plot used in romance anime, pick up Ouran High School Host Club.  The hosts will be waiting for you.

    Probably one of the worst anime&#039;s I watched. Everything about the anime in my opinion is honestly horrible. Have you wanted to find out the real truth about this anime? Then look no further! Just read on!! :D<br />
<br />
<br />
Story 3/10: The story is honestly the worst plot I have ever heard, a girl goes to a rich school. Of course she has extremely short hair and looks like a man due to some &#039;gum incident&#039;! Its overly predictable. There is too many of these stupid drama high school animes to begin with, though Ouran High School Host Club is by far the worst. <br />
  

          <span style="display: none;" id="review38864">
         This anime was supposed to have comedy in it, though not once did I find anything they said funny, what I find more pathetic is that they basically were begging you to laugh, saying the most stupid things. My response instead of laughing was actually &#039;why the hell am I still watching this?!&#039; and many times I was seconds away from dropping the anime altogether.<br />
<br />
Art 2/10: The drawings are horrible. Over 90% of the anime I had no idea what was going on due to the lighting of the show. They made it too bright and I could barely tell what was going on, having to guess most of the time, as well as the horrible lighting it hurt my eyes in a few minutes, making me want to not even watch the rest of an episode. The background and environment was badly drawn as well, making it extremely unenjoyable to watch.<br />
<br />
Sound 3/10: They did a horrible job with the music choice. The music didn&#039;t flow nicely with the concept of the show. Although I&#039;m not sure what could, since its such a horrible anime. The voices and recordings seems low and poor. I had to turn my speakers up very high to just barely hear what they were saying.<br />
<br />
Characters 3/10: The characters seemed to be forced to be a certin way thoughout the whole show, making it extremely distasteful. Honestly all the guys seemed like homosexuals to me, even if their personalities wern&#039;t acting like one. They all seemed cliche which was something I dislike very much. They all seemed like a joke to me and it was very diffacult for me to take any of them seriously, in the most serious of situations.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 1/10: It was honestly a pathetic show. I had not one ounce of enjoyment during any part of watching it. Me finishing it is even a miracle to myself and I often wonder how I got though such a horrible anime. The beginning even starts out horrible and I just continued watching hoping that it would get better, sadly it didn&#039;t. It was honestly a total waste of my time and if I could take make the time back I used to watch this anime I would in a heartbeat.<br />
<br />
Overall 1/10: Overall, it was the worst and most pathetic excuse for an anime I have ever seen. I honestly don&#039;t consider it an anime, it seems more like a joke to me. Everything seemed to be written by a ten year old with some sort of issue. The story was horrible, the music was horrible, and the characters were a disgrace. Why people actually enjoy is anime is mystery to me. <br />
<br />
So if you want to waste your time and be disappointed at the end then the pathetic excuse for the anime Ouran High School Host Club is the perfect show for you! Be expected to just be disappoined in the end, because it was a major disappointment to me. Of course I know that people will be offended by this review, but I&#039;m just speaking the honest truth of this anime. Now that the truth is out, its you choice wether you want to waste your time or not.

    This was one of those anime I just couldn&#039;t get into. I tried. I really, really tried and wanted to like it since I heard such good things about it, but it just never happened. The characters were alright, but I wasn&#039;t really engaged with it. I think I wanted there to be more growth with the characters, but they stayed more or less the same all the way to where I decided to drop it.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a cute show, but I just don&#039;t think it was for me. Give it a shot though. You might enjoy it more than I do.

    A story based on Bishounen boys in High School and a girl who has no qualms about being either a girl or boy. Haha.. One of the best animes watched after Yamato Nadeshiko Shinchi Henge (which is still not finished yet.. haha.. Still waiting for epi 25). <br />
<br />
The plot is very simple but as the story unfolds, we are able to see life in and beyond high school and how these 5 Bishounen boys and 1 indifferent girl cope with their troubles / misgivings. <br />
<br />
Well, the ending did indicate a hint of something, but since the story stops only at 26, we won\&#039;t noe if

          <span style="display: none;" id="review456">
        that something will develop into something more.. Haha.. I\&#039;m currently reading the manga.. We\&#039;ll see if that particular something develops in the manga itself (wich I hope so.. hehe..).<br />
<br />
To those who hae doubts watching this anime, you might wanna try watching an epi or two before deciding to slash it totally from your list.. I was doubtful at firts.. but I read the manga, got hooked to the storyline and went online to download the anime.. <br />
<br />
For those who are going to watch.. ENJOY!!!!

    Ouran Host Club mocks all your shoujo stereotypes while simultaneously utilizing those same stereotypes to create a wonderful series. I&#039;d say that takes talent.<br />
<br />
STORY - I avoided this series for a long time just because the premise didn&#039;t interest me, and from a distance, it seemed like one of those parodies that would err on the side of taking itself too seriously. I&#039;m really glad I ended up giving it a chance though; Ouran High School Host Club manages to be hilarious from the get-go and is surprisingly adorable. It&#039;s perfect in portraying the handful of stereotypes that appear over and over again in shoujo

          <span style="display: none;" id="review11168">
        and doesn&#039;t shy away from blatant self-references and mockery to make sure it doesn&#039;t take itself too seriously. And yet, the series somehow still manages to have a captivating &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot; side and great romance potential. <br />
<br />
I like to gripe a lot about anime adaptations of manga that aren&#039;t finished too, but Host Club has an excellent and concluded storyline (with huge potential for a sequel!) despite the still-running manga. Admittedly, I haven&#039;t read much of said manga yet, but from what I can tell, the anime follows it pretty damn precisely. Many of the episodes are very silly and episodic, and there&#039;s also the predictable handful of episodes dedicated to each character&#039;s backstory, but there&#039;s rarely a dull moment. It&#039;s entertaining and fun through and through.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER - For a cast conceived entirely of over-used stereotypes, Host Club really does an amazing job in keeping everyone interesting, especially since it isn&#039;t afraid to point out those obvious type molds. There isn&#039;t really anything particular or unique about Haruhi, but that&#039;s exactly what makes her so easy to relate to. Her androgyny only furthers this by destroying that gender barrier, and honestly, I&#039;d love to see more reverse traps in anime. Haruhi is great at balancing characteristics that are considered typical of both men and women, and she&#039;s also endearingly oblivious. Never underestimate the power of stupidly endearing characteristics... Tamaki is a fun character for all the same reasons.<br />
<br />
He has tons of little quirks -- many of them are common, but that doesn&#039;t stop them from being effective when they&#039;re so well done. Everyone gets those obligatory background episodes that explore their personalities beyond the stereotype. It&#039;s a tricky thing to give a parody a personality; how do you give them depth without seeming pretentious or just like the cliches you&#039;re trying to mock? I&#039;m really not sure, but somehow Host Club manages. The twins have a completely generic emo twin backstory, but I&#039;m still compelled to sympathize with them and to empathize with their friendships with the rest of the club. Kyouya has a similarly generic sibling angst story, but I still like the bastard. Mori and Honey weren&#039;t as interesting to me personally, but I can still see where their appeal would be for others.<br />
<br />
In the end, it isn&#039;t so much the originality of the characters that make them so good -- it&#039;s their interaction with each other. Everything feels natural. It&#039;s just entertaining to watch them go about their shenanigans and to hear them mock one another, their genre, otaku culture, and random other things. And the subtlety of their strong friendships is what ties the whole series together. As the episodes build on, it gets clearer and clearer just how important those friendships are. Yes, this is a satire and a comedy, but there&#039;s a good story about friendship buried under all that too. It&#039;s a simple and generic story, but it&#039;s a good story all the same.<br />
<br />
ARTSTYLE &amp;amp; ANIMATION - I really love the style and animation used in the opening theme. It&#039;s clean and cute and pretty unique-looking. Hell, the opening in general is just adorable and fun to look at, and it&#039;s one of the few that I actually sat through and watched more than a half dozen times. The style in the series itself is pretty generic, but as most of the characters were designed to be generic, this really isn&#039;t too big a deal. Indeed, all the characters perfectly master the visual charm that made their stereotypes so widely popular to begin with. And at the same time, the designs somehow manage to also capture the personal quirks that each character still has -- the twins are typical badboys, but their emotion is still there; there are probably twenty billion characters that look exactly like Kyouya, but somehow, he still feels like his own person. It&#039;s interesting (maybe it&#039;s the uniform?).<br />
<br />
There are also lots of nice backgrounds in Host Club. It&#039;s a very fancypants and elaborate academy after all. Sure, a lot of the wide exterior shots and some of the interiors are recycled a lot, but they&#039;re still intricate and pretty backdrops. The animation is pretty average. There&#039;s nothing particularly spectacular, but I don&#039;t really think there&#039;s really anything that needs to look spectacular. Funny thing about shoujo, there aren&#039;t usually too many fights that need to be animated super smoothly. XD<br />
<br />
MUSIC - The opening theme, &amp;quot;Sakura Kiss&amp;quot; by Chieko Kawabe is a really cute song. It&#039;s upbeat and fun and just an all around fitting theme to the series in general. For the dub, the song is translated into English, and it works surprisingly well. The voice sounds exactly the same, and I really thought the singer just had two versions of the song at first. The translated lyrics work pretty nicely too. I didn&#039;t like the end theme as much as the opening, but that usually seems to be the case because they&#039;re just generally not as exciting.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack in the series is nicely varied. To emphasize the rich, upper class and noble environment, there are often classical instrumental themes; the moods are often exaggerated with very shrill, high-tension violins for the action and drama and soft, melancholic piano for the emotional and tragic scenes (cheerful, everyday scenes are usually accompanied by flutes and strings). It&#039;s good to note that even the music sticks with the over-the-top and satirical nature of many of the scenes. For more serious bits, the music follows suit and calms down to more traditional melodies, including several instrumental versions of the opening theme and the piano themes that Tamaki plays. As a fan of classical music, I tend to be drawn to soundtracks like this, but either way, I think everything suited Host Club very well.<br />
<br />
VOICE ACTING - I saw the first half of the series dubbed (all that&#039;s currently available on DVD) and the rest subbed. It&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve seen a dub first, but Host Club&#039;s dub seriously impressed me. Vic Mignogna is the perfect Tamaki. He nails every line and every emotion, and it&#039;s just a very convincing performance overall. One of my biggest voice acting peeves is when actors don&#039;t change their voices between roles, which gets really annoying really fast in English dubs because there&#039;s such a limited talent pool. When Tamaki is acting flustered or funny!angry, he sounds a bit like Edward Elric, but for the most part, Mignogna manages to give the character a distinct voice, and I found that to be very impressive. Caitlin Glass as Haruhi was also pretty amazing, and I was again really happy to hear a distinct voice for the character. Honestly, the entire cast was excellent and all the voices were wonderfully suited to their roles (the only annoying voices were for the annoying characters!).<br />
<br />
It seems that the English dub is aimed very much for an otaku crowd as well. A few honorifics are carried over without explicit explanation, particularly &amp;quot;senpai&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;-chan,&amp;quot; and the cute shortening of names before attaching the &amp;quot;-chan&amp;quot; (like Haru-chan or Hika-chan) is also kept. It was really weird hearing it at first, but all things considered, I think it turned out pretty well. It doesn&#039;t feel overly unnatural, and those little speech habits really keep characters like Honey and Haruhi truer to the original. (Now if only they could figure out a way to translate distinct first-person pronouns...) It&#039;s fitting since Host Club does so well to mock otaku culture, and it definitely added to the experience to hear such lulzy culture-generated terms like &amp;quot;twincest.&amp;quot; The translation felt very relevant and in-touch to the English-speaking otaku scene which was fantastic.<br />
<br />
The original Japanese cast is pretty good too, but I don&#039;t think I like Mamoru Miyano as Tamaki as much as I like Vic Mignogna. While Mignogna only occasionally strays to Ed&#039;s voice, I often hear a host of other characters when I hear Miyano... of course, that might just be because I&#039;ve heard more of Miyano&#039;s roles than Mignogna, but all the same. Maaya Sakamoto as Haruhi was better, and I found it hilarious that Haruhi&#039;s poor singing skills are emphasized when Sakamoto is such a lovely singer. I prefer the Hitachiin twins&#039; Japanese voices to their English counterparts because they&#039;re easier to distinguish from one another, and that&#039;s one of the easiest ways I had to tell them apart. Since much of the rest of the cast is very stereotypical, their Japanese and English voices were about on the same level; the actors sounded typecasted, but that works just fine. Sometimes, I just get tired of reading subtitles, so while the original cast is good, I think Host Club&#039;s dub is one of the few I&#039;d choose to watch over the sub if given the choice.<br />
<br />
OVERALL - I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever wanted a sequel for a series as much as I do for this one. The ending is predictable but adorable and practically begs for a follow-up series -- how is it that Ouran High School Host Club mocks so much of what&#039;s common in shoujo, but somehow manages to use all the same formulas to make you love it? I suppose it&#039;s proof that even the most tired of cliches can be given new life if done right. There are no original ideas left, but there are still new, fun, and interesting ways to twist around what&#039;s around there. To all the skeptics, I highly recommend giving this series a shot. The first eight dub episodes are available streaming on FUNimation&#039;s website (the first three episodes are also available subbed). I was a skeptic too.

    Story :9:  This anime is adapted from the manga series by Bisco Hatori and tells the story of a poor girl that was excepted in to a very rich high school.  She finds herself in debt for 8,000,000 yen and is forced to become the schools Host Club&#039;s dog until she pays it back.  The story is wonderfully rounded with mostly comedy and romance but it throws some drama in at the appropriate moments.  It kept me coming back for more and more and in the end it left me wanting.  I only gave it a nine because of some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1542">
        small missing people or story lines from the manga that I really enjoyed.<br />
<br />
Art :10:  The art in Ouran is amazing.  Not necessarily the animation itself, but the storyboard was done beautifully.  It had a flavour all its own that sets it apart from the manga and from other animes in it&#039;s genre.  The use of the cut away scenes to express what the characters are feeling adds so much to the storyline by giving this wonderful &amp;quot;oh I get it&amp;quot; factor when the story is completely finished.  Definitely a 10!<br />
<br />
Sound :10:  I am not really sure how I should rate the sound.  But I thought that the voice actors did a wonderful job and that the music was appropriate and at times really lovely.<br />
<br />
Character :10:  The one thing that I really enjoyed about this show was the character development.  The way you could follow the growth of the main characters and understand why they were who they were was just awesome.  The back stories were marvelously included in stages so you always knew what you needed to know about the people involved.  I was very surprised that I could learn so much about them in just 26 episodes.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment :10:  If you haven&#039;t figured it out by now, I really enjoyed watching this show.  Not only the first time, but every time I have re watched it or showed it to friends, the enjoyment not only stays but adjust in an awesome way when you notice things you did not before.<br />
<br />
Overall :10:  This show as a whole definitely gets a 10 from me.  But don&#039;t just take my word for it, go, watch it now.

    Sometimes you just feel down in the dumps, and nothing seems to interest you. Well, Ouran just might be the perfect antidote to your melancholy - I guarantee that 5 minutes into the first episode of this anime and you will be laughing your head off at the genius absurdity of this show.<br />
<br />
Either that, or you&#039;ll leave IMMEDIATELY due to its stupidity and complete idiocy. But hey, most people stay, so why wouldn&#039;t you?<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Most people are tired of the typical, cheesy shojo series where &amp;quot;boy meets girl, they fall in love and live happily ever after&amp;quot;. I know for one that I am SICK of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9256">
        such series. Ouran gives a refreshing new plot, where for once the heroine is not a complete air-head, and in fact is the voice of reason in the show! *gasps* The premise of a host club is just so new and unique that it&#039;s like sticking colour in a black-and-white photograph<br />
<br />
Art<br />
I am a sucker for good art. Bones has officially become my favourite animation studio due to the great work they did with OHSHC. The manga art was ok, but the anime art was -almost- flawless. Although it was simple, as they say, &amp;quot;simple is art&amp;quot;.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The opening and ending themes accompany all 26 episodes. I have to say that Sakura Kiss was the perfect tune to open up each episode of OHSHC. The opening music fitted each frame perfectly. Background music is not that memorable, while the ending theme, Shissou, is not to my taste, but is decent enough. <br />
<br />
Character<br />
Hatori Bisco has created the most memorable set of characters. For one, as I have mentioned before, for once in the history of anime the heroine is NOT a complete air-head, and is the voice of reason in the story! Haruhi gets a 10/10 from me, along with Kyouya and Honey-sempai. Character-wise, Tamaki&#039;s personality is not the most original (the devilishly handsome baka); neither are Hikaru and Kaoru&#039;s, but they get 9.5/10 for character development. You can just see how much Hikaru changes over the course of the story, which is really quite...heartwarming, if I may. <br />
From the exuberant Tamaki, to the calculating Kyouya, to the stoic Mori, there will be someone in the host club that appeals to your taste.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
Out of all the shows I&#039;ve ever watched, OHSHC is probably the one show where I&#039;ve laughed every single episode. Once, I even fell out of my chair laughing. Does that explain why I gave it a 10/10 for enjoyment?<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
This anime is probably one of the only ones I will ever rewatch. It&#039;s such a delightful romantic comedy. With a group of beautiful bishounen to boot, the Ouran High School Host Club is sure to sweep you off your feet. <br />
<br />
Step into the Third Music Room, into the world of Ouran High School. You&#039;ll not regret it. <br />
<br />
