    For a studio that is well-known for handling many many anime featuring lots of cute girl, Ikebukuro West Gate Park (IWGP hereafter) is certainly a surprising line-up for studio Doga Kobo and for that reason alone I think it was interesting to keep an eye for this series. Whether or not it’s your cup of tea — whether or not you enjoy 24 minutes of angst every week — there’s one thing going for this anime: it wants to dream a little bigger. The bottom line here isn’t about money nor is it about broad appeal. This isn’t a show engineered from the ground up

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369229">
        to reap in DVD sales and related cash-ins like seiyuu vocal CDs, nor people going to go out and buy a figurine of the freaking lord and saviour Makoto the Fruits Seller. That’s the thing I respect, but as a whole series, IWGP just falls in to the good old “bad adaptation” problem.<br />
<br />
The series is based on a set of Japanese novels, which were originally published in 1998. It’s a series of urban mystery following an event/incident in the district of Ikebukuro. Do you want human interest stories that are slightly heavy-handed in its delivery? Then this is kind of show. There are themes of abandonment, drugs, murder, and abuse etc. but also solidarity and sacrifice. In all this is kind of also another slice of show shows, but this time the real concerns go beyond “my two sisters keep trying to seduce me” or “I’m so awesome that my only flaw is my virginity.”<br />
<br />
But the problem with this anime is the fact it was mostly episodic side stories following the pattern of “Client of the week” in desperate situations and frequently approaching Makoto for solutions. Unfortunately, the execution was pretty rushed, Due to the anime’s episodic nature, the ultimately inconsequential side stories are forced to wrap themselves up in an incredibly short amount of time. IWGP thus maintains its brisk, frenetic pacing, but none of the conclusions ever feel all that satisfying. Our bad guy of the week barely has time to establish himself as a threat before going down. Likewise, is there a lacks of detail of clients that we are supposed to lament then the story’s over and we’ll probably never see them face again.<br />
<br />
There’s also the fact that episodic anime can’t do a deep dive on weighty topics. We can’t really say a few sentences about justice and pat ourselves on the back. But what else can an episodic anime do? We’ve only got twenty-is minutes. For someone like me, a show like IWGP just leaves me wanting. From a storytelling standpoint, yeah, we need to move on. From a philosophical standpoint, I’m like itching to jump in the ring. But let’s follow the anime’s cue and move on…<br />
<br />
That’s pretty neat, I guess,” is the most glowing praise I can ever offer to any given IWGP episode. Social commentary about Youtuber essentially selling their life for making content looks… neat, I guess. Single parenting and stress lead to child abusing sounds… neat, I guess. Hell, the action is sometimes very neat. But we never get to dwell on anything for very long. Now, now, let’s hurry along. After all, the episode is about to come to an end. We should begin preparing ourselves for next week’s entirely new set of characters and problems<br />
<br />
If the story lacks detail, it usually leaves us feeling pretty flat. We are not be able to identify with the characters or plot in the way we would if there were more efforts made to describe the characters and scenes with care and attention. This is also what I feel regarding IWGP characters, Makoto is just your typical anime leads with high sense of justice, pretty caring and always try to helping people whatever he can. There’s no origins where he acts like that, and as results I found his characters to be flat to the point the most interesting thing about him to me is making fun of him with “The Lord and Saviour Makoto the fruit seller” whenever the story begin or come to its conclusion.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I don’t find King/Takashi all that compelling either. He just doesn’t strike me as a very realistic character. Instead, he’s more like some person’s fanciful idea of what a mysterious, beautiful person would be. Appears out of nowhere without any background whatsoever, uncharacteristically refined, and pretty skillful in hand to hand combat. Truthfully, I think all of these characters besides Makoto were all sides characters because they don’t have much screen time even compared to the ‘client’ characters. Not to mention there are some internal conflicts in G-boys that takes 2 episodes but it feels so lifeless because we just don’t care about the characters. <br />
<br />
I was even wondering that IWGP would be sooo much better if these episodic adventures were not through told by Makoto as a focal point. Something like different episodes, different protagonist, different personality Whether it is by King, by Makoto or even by those Red Angel. Because other characters are very paper thin as a result. There’s not even a characters/flashback arc throughout the series. But having doing research for the novel, I think that wasn’t a case.<br />
<br />
As for the visual, I think it was good. Everyone is given a very clear and distinct, instantly recognisable look, still somewhat realistic character designs and a whole lot of attention to detail, both in the background stills but also the foreground. Later on, it seems a few more digitised scenes crept in, but this did not impact the style negatively. It does seem that there was quite a budget for the visuals. The tracks themselves might be rather simple rock music (though some will no doubt put them in a music genre consisting of far too many words) but splendidly fit with the visuals. The intro song is a fan favourite, and to my opinion deservedly so.<br />
<br />
IWGP has a lot of flaws. It isn’t overly original and the story doesn’t go in unprecedented directions like you’d hope. Considering the themes, it was brought on, it’s disappointing that the series sticks to explore it only on superficial level when it absolutely has every opportunity to be something deeper and more memorable. <br />
<br />
Having said that, at least there’s positives, I like the technical qualities that Doga Kobo offer here and I do not mind if they adapt more of this kind of series in the future. <br />

    ‘Cringe’ is the best possible description for this anime. <br />
<br />
I do not know, I was really hyped for Ikebukuro West Gate Park. After all, Ikebukuro West Gate Park is an anime, where young men, living in Ikebukuro are supposed to right the wrongs that proper authorities cannot. Where law is helpless, a gang called ‘G-Boys’ is there to save the day. An anime about the ugly side of Japan, this is going to be one of the best anime of this season, or not? <br />
<br />
Yet, this is just cringe. Although, I hate this word, this is the best description for the anime. While I did

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369221">
        not read the manga, the anime looks like the people, who are responsible for it, do not know anything about real gangs. Like, just watch some GTO, if you have no idea. IWGP, however, focuses on a gang, where the leader is just some ballet dancer, or a pro dancer, does not matter. And sometimes the whole gang just watches the boss dancing. This is just so cringe. All the characters look like some members of a popular k-pop boys’ band, or something; which is also somewhat of a problem for you to take the whole show seriously. <br />
<br />
And this is pretty much the story, cool bishounenes saving the day dancing and sometimes mediating disputes between other gang members. Characters wise, what would you expect from a guy, who has a ‘smoking kills’ T-Shirt. This is the same as a teacher that tries to explain children that masturbation is the way to hell. This is just beyond cringe. Makoto, one of the protagonists, sometimes is more of a captain obvious than Shirou Emiya himself. <br />
<br />
All in all, this is the whole anime. Perhaps, I should not kept my hopes high. I do not know. Anyways, if this is what you want to see, go for it. But if you think that IWGP has some realism and interesting story to offer, bad luck. Regardless, the choice is yours to make.

    So far, IWGP has got me excited especially on EP. 6 &amp; 7. It has gotten more interesting.<br />
<br />
EP. 1 - 7/10<br />
EP. 2 - 8/10<br />
EP. 3 - 6/10<br />
EP. 4 - 8/10<br />
EP. 5 - 8/10<br />
EP. 6 - 8/10<br />
EP. 7 - 9/10<br />
<br />
WILL RECOMMEND TO WATCH? YES!<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt; IWGP took a brave move to have different stories on each episode. At first, I was so hesitant to continue after Ep.1 due to the pace of the story and the unconvincing plot. But still, mystery and thrill excites me.<br />
<br />
&gt; I honestly like this kind of anime: the street vibes, city/urban setting, gangs and some action scenes. I like the art style

          <span style="display: none;" id="review364590">
        and its animation.<br />
<br />
&gt; The characters have unique descriptions and characteristics. In some point, I feel like I&#039;d like to know more about those characters of who really they are. I&#039;m waiting for character development showing their purpose and a bit of their life story.<br />
<br />
&gt; The thrills and mysteries in each episodes got me hooked and wanting more especially on Ep. 6 &amp; 7. The story of Ep. 3 is a let down for me as it feels so shallow and ineffective for a &#039;gang&#039; anime.<br />
<br />
&gt; I enjoyed some music played like jazz on Ep. 4. The opening and ending themes suits the anime really well and its so good!<br />
<br />
&gt; Though IWGP revolves on gang stories, I still love the way they put some slice of life moments or realistic scenes that would touch the heart of the viewer. Brotherhood, family, and kindness are just some few topics that viewers can relate to.<br />
<br />
&gt; Overall, IWGP is a good anime that can be improved and shows a lot of potential to be at the top. The story improves as each episode goes by, so far. I am wondering: What stories could be the next episodes are? Or, What could be the main plot of the series? Really interesting!<br />
<br />

    Tell me, what did you expect after reading synopsis? I expected a criminal drama, where our mc tries his best to find out the truth while being caught between two fighting gangs. What I did not expect was to see a bunch of boy scouts instead of a gang who do such horrible gang crimes as dance performing, helping single mothers and immigrants and guarding peace in the neighborhood. If it does not sound even remotely close to crime drama - you are not the only one confused. 10 episodes out of 12 are wasted on showing how mc is a good &quot;fixer&quot; guy. I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369228">
        may be wrong, but that kind of introduction should only take an episode or two at best, not most of the season. I could get it if those stories were linked in any way to the actual drama, that is shown in the last two episodes - it would be some insanely long build up, but if executed correctly it would justify all those unlinked meaningless stories. But you see, when you put a bunch of those stories and forget to give them any link to or place in the main plot line - what is even a point of having them? It felt like the first 10 episodes were a giant filler, and they are here just to waste viewers time instead of showing them the show they came for. As for me, cause of this mess I arrived at ep11 already bored and there was not a single chance that anything would redeem this huge waste of time. I doubt I have ever seen such big problems with pacing before.<br />
If we move from discussing the plot - things are still pretty bad. Characters for example - there are lots of them. But only a few have a constant place in this show, and even those few are pretty undeveloped and feel more like the tools that mc uses to solve problems in the neighbourhood. Like what do we know about the King, who is literally the most influential character around and a great pal of our MC? Well, he is cool and respected, basically it. The rest of the cast either gets that kind of treatment or even worse.<br />
Visuals? They are fine, being a real world it is not really hard thing to draw adequate, but nothing more is done to make the visuals stand out and be something above mediocre.<br />
Sound? Well, the choice of tracks fits the theme, but it is not my type of music so I can&#039;t call opening and ending good. For bgm in episodes themselves - I can&#039;t even recall if there was a bgm to be honest.<br />
Enjoyment? Story and paicing ruined any enjoyment for me.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: a huge unfun waste of time. You may like it if you like unconnected shallow stories, but for most people I would advice skipping this anime entirely.

    The anime that is in every sense of the word, akin to Durarara!!, yet the majority of the people make the assumption/mistake that this series was a rip-off of the former. In actual fact, this show came FIRST (debuted in 2001), and the former (debuted in 2004) was merely inspired from it (that was leaps better in every way). If you&#039;re watching this show, please take note of this pointer.<br />
<br />
I do have a legitimate worry for people and studios trying to capitalize on decades-old source materials that were lost in time. If you remember the 2 shows that aired in Spring 2020: Yesterday wo Utatte

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369223">
        (produced by Doga Kobo, based on a manga) and Kitsutsuki Tanteidokoro (produced by Liden Films, based on a novel), both were late-90s source materials that if were adapted right and close to their original magic, could usher in the new revival of old-school adaptations. Sadly this wasn&#039;t the case, with the former getting a rushed adaptation (for the 2nd half) and the latter being better in its original material (because it&#039;s so boring to watch). Fast forward to Fall 2020, and Doga Kobo is back with adapting another early 2000s classic: Ikebukuro West Gate Park (or IWGP for short), written by Ira Ishida and based off a novel, a live-action TV series and a manga (that was a loose adaptation of the live-action TV version).<br />
<br />
But what is this show about, you ask? In a nutshell, as mentioned in the beginning, think of it like Durarara!!: the crime-ridden city of Ikebukuro, where majority of the city is ruled by violent gangs and frequent clashes of turfs for the taking, only less refined. The MC is the city&#039;s gang mediator-cum-troubleshooter, Makoto Majima (who&#039;s living together with his single-family mother). A 20-year-old guy who often sees himself getting caught in frivolous acts of crime from seemingly both related and unrelated cases, and has ties with the gang that has a majority stake of Ikebukuro: the G-Boys, lead by his old schoolmate, the goofy and serious two-faced Andou &quot;King&quot; Takashi. In this aggravating city where crime does not pay, the single-family supporting son must tread through the vast wilderness of violent outbreaks that range from rival factions to sporadic situations, and even requests from strangers and close friends requiring protection to loved ones being victimized for revenge in the process, solving these various cases and resolving them faster than the local police could, before more lives are lost.<br />
<br />
Now here my problem with this adaptation: Ira Ishida&#039;s material undoubtedly gives off the old-school vibe, but to adapt the 4 volume manga seems like a waste in comparison (as akin to just watching the 2000 TV version instead, albeit with a few differences). So, I&#039;d presume that the scriptwriters made up their own version of IWGP by composing entirely new story scripts to reflect the modern-day standards of Japan in the classic episodic story format, and truth be told, the execution is both hit-and-miss. There are some instances where the episodes are really good (I love that one story where they focused on Japan&#039;s treatment of foreigners), but the rest were just the same-old cardboard cut-outs of unlinked, repetitious self-contained stories with mindless rival gang fighting over turfs that maintain the power balance of the gang environments (if you don&#039;t count the episodes featuring another formidable gang: the Red Angels). If you&#039;re looking for a story to be worth investing your time into, this show will most likely turn you off from its episodic format as there are little overarching plots (that span 2-part episodes at max).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there is little to highlight about character development, as most of them tend to be 2-faced: neutral, or (un)necessarily triggered. For the few (like Makoto&#039;s mother), they do have personality and past histories to back their hard-lived environments and growing-up circumstances that shape their &quot;organizational behaviours&quot; to both friends and strangers through kinship, but sadly those are far and few in-between for a setting like this (that I&#039;d really like to see more of). Most of the gang members (between both G-Boys and Red Angels, save for the respecting leading duo of King and Kyouichi, along with troubleshooter Makoto) are one-note, and is about what I&#039;d expect of the typical one-note bad rap of gangs that are in for the violence and overflowing revenge.<br />
<br />
Doga Kobo&#039;s in-house director Tomoaki Koshida is back from Senko-san to direct this series, and the visuals are just about as expected: replicating Yesterday wo Utatte&#039;s old-school palettes of art and animation to match, only this time, adding the dark mystery vibes that are associated with drama-type shows, and I have to give some good credit to the studio for a pretty good and consistent production from start to finish. Sure, there isn&#039;t as much Sakuga that you can cherry-pick with some decent action, but at least the action was solid, no questions asked. Good job Doga Kobo, double thumbs up.<br />
<br />
The music...is another hit-and-miss department, I&#039;m sad to say. I remember watching the horribly-made adaptation of &quot;Junji Itou: Collection&quot;, and THE PINBALLS&#039;s OP &quot;Shichiten Battou no Blues&quot; (that screams &quot;ISOLATION DOPE!!!&quot;) was so freaking excellent, it has remained memorable to me (even to this day). So to my amazement when &quot;Needle Knot&quot; came out, it was...OK at best. The same &quot;in-your-face&quot; bombastic quality signature of the group, but kinda missing the &quot;OOMPH!&quot; factor somewhere in between. A good effort, but nothing close to the quality that was once hearkened. And what better way to reflect the gang setting through the rapping ED by INNOSENT in FORMAL, but to be frank, the more I hear this song, the more I relinquished it as pure white noise. Their 2nd ED song &quot;Omou mama&quot; on the other hand, it&#039;s a calm and collected, but fantastic sounding song that I&#039;d wished had appeared more. Maybe it&#039;s my personal preference of a bias to have heart-warming songs that are in stark contrast to dark and mystical shows like this, but in this case, along with the fine line of different story plots, this payoff really worked well.<br />
<br />
In a season full of many average-to-decent (and few great) shows, this show I can only classify this as part of the middle-road package of being decent. Nothing eye-popping really stands out (other than the lore of gangs/crime aspect), and since this show hasn&#039;t had a clear direction (other than both start and end points), it&#039;s easy to be distracted by boredom, even if you tell yourself to &quot;stick to the end&quot;. Let this sentence ring true: &quot;If it ain&#039;t CGDCT (which is Doga Kobo&#039;s work ethos), you&#039;re gonna be hung about a 50-50 chance of watching a good or bad show.&quot; Nevertheless, for the 3 of you who likes gang/crime settings like Durarara!!, this is the show for you, otherwise, give this the unquoted 3-episode rule treatment.

    So far this season has plenty of outstanding series both in action and episodic slice of life, such as Majo no Tabitabi, Tonikawa, Jujutsu Kaisen and Akudama Drive. Considering that Ikebukuro has exactly this same two genres, and maybe drama, as it&#039;s main highlights, it&#039;s covering a niche that is fulfilled with other shows that I consider better overall, and that makes for a pretty mild and average show for the season it&#039;s airing, and that I would only recommend for people that really like the &#039;street gang&#039; vibe or that are here just to see some hot dudes having badass and beautifully animated fights

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361686">
        against some bad guys that no one cares. But well... the series is not unbearable either.<br />
<br />
Story - 5<br />
<br />
The anime follows episodical conflicts that somehow involve our MC, Makoto, and the street gang thematic. So far we&#039;ve got some drug dealers, some vandals hired to put pressure on exploited employees of a restaurant, the cringiest youtuber that you&#039;ll see in your goddamn life and a retrospective murder case of a gang leader that was so far the best and most human. Structure of 3 first chapter is almost the same, like &#039;there is a trouble, we investigate the trouble, some twist happens and it ends up with the badass gang beating the shit out of the bad guys&#039;. In the first two chapters is acceptable, and the ending scene of episode two might be the more cathartic so far in the anime, but by the third episode it got really tiring. Thankfully, it changed on chapter for so maybe we can hope for more variety on new stuff. By now, it&#039;s just mediocre.<br />
<br />
Characters - 6<br />
<br />
Excepting Youtuber-san from episode 3 that I don&#039;t even dare mentioning here, the characters are pretty neutral. I mean, they&#039;re mostly cool, and some of their design makes me really question my heterosexuality (specially Red Angels leader), but the only glimpse of development to anyone of them just showed up on episode 4, so not much to highlight here.<br />
<br />
Art - 8<br />
<br />
Doga Kobo is one of the studios that, when I see their making an anime, I&#039;ll made sure to check it out, since they almost never miss (btw two of my three favourite anime, Yesterday wo Utatte and Yuru Yuri, are produced by Doga Kobo). The studio may be mostly known by moe and comedy such as Nozaki-kun or Gabriel Dropout, and having director of Senko-san in charge of the anime must seem to confirm this impression, but they&#039;re more mature and serious style is just as good, if not better, as the moe one. Direction is not stellar, but it&#039;s incredibly solid, and animation is always consistent and fluid. The anime is not as sakuga-packed as Jujustsu Kaisen, but it does never feel lacking either, so it looks genuinely great.<br />
<br />
Sound - 8<br />
<br />
OST is very nice, specially enjoyed the jazz tracks on ep 4. Sound desing is correct too, nothing special but pretty consistent from what I noticed. The thing that made me classify sound as very good was the incredible opening, Needle Knot. The song has a punk rock style which I really enjoy and the psychodelic visuals are a great complement to it. Prossibly best op of the season. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 5<br />
<br />
As I said before, the anime is just fine at the best &#039;till now. I really disliked ep 3 but the others were a fine watch, nothing outstanding but nothing that made me drop it either.<br />
<br />
Overall - 6

    I&#039;m not going to do a whole breakdown of each character, story, plot, music, etc sort of thing. I am enjoying it with what it has so far. It maybe because I am a sucker for gangs in anime and this is around that alley. I also kind of like the real life look on things. Synthetic marijuana, possible gang beef, workforce stress. Sad to say, the youtube one as well even though that was truly awful to watch that really shows how these Youtubers are and how viewers eat it all up. That kind of &quot;real&quot; about the show is entertaining. I see why

          <span style="display: none;" id="review362506">
        the 3rd episode was the reason why the show was dropped but I&#039;m happy I watched the fourth episode. I am hoping for an actual story/plot to come along though, I&#039;m not a huge fan of the little stories on each episode but it could be worse. I&#039;ll stay hopeful and continue to watch. It&#039;s not that bad minus the cringey 3rd episode.

    The most important thing to think about while watching this anime is to take note of the story and the small things and relate it back to todays society. I wold say this is for those who would focus on storytelling over anything else, the story is very well told and i cant wait to see what will happen next in this compelling story. Its not as fast paced as some would like but thats what makes it so good as well, you get very well developed characters with this slower pace. In my opinion this kind of storytelling us well worth watching if you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review367947">
        are mature and patience enough to take the time to reflect on the story. So with this anime, focus on the story, nothing else, this is a perfect piece of fiction close to the real world yet keeping the flare of being a work of fiction. As that its maybe not for everyone i can see how this would be something for me as a movie nerd rather than the casual watcher. I would strongly suggest this anime for those willing to go deep in to the story.

    IWGP may  not be everyone&#039;s top pick this season. That&#039;s ok. For me it&#039;s definitely up there. When I started it I figured it was &#039;just another gang anime&#039;, I was sorely mistaken. It&#039;s about dealing with real life issues that many watching probably don&#039;t experience. There&#039;s very little linear story, it&#039;s more of a collaboration of short-stories told through the protagonist&#039;s pov. <br />
<br />
As of writing I just finished ep.5. One of my favorite points is each episode has a lesson to it, like fables (Short stories that teach a lesson). In ep5 the lesson was something akin to &quot;Even though where you are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review362683">
        may have problems, you are blessed because others have it far worse.&quot; I found this to be very relatable. <br />
<br />
In short I think IWGP is well suited towards an older audience, and I applaud the breaking of the mold of the writers and producers. I gave it a 9 because it&#039;s different, and I enjoy different.

    This is the very first review i&#039;m writing and its for one very specific reason, I want more people to enjoy this  GEM of a show. (9 eps in so far)<br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t your conventional anime and the genre tags really don&#039;t make much sense but let me tell you was this show a ride. It made me scream with exciment, cry(ep 9 hit hard), laugh hard. This show&#039;s got it all. <br />
<br />
The Soundtrack and the OP/ED are bangers too. <br />
<br />
The duality of Majima and the underground of Tokyo plays very nicely with the shows atmosphere and the way Majima goes about doing things is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review365869">
        just too satisfying. Even though the show is semi-episodic, it gave me closure after each episode and there was very noticeable character with Majima.<br />
<br />
Give this show a try and you wouldn&#039;t regret it!

    Well to start things of, I feel that it has an interesting story and plot to it, but it just doesn&#039;t catch my interest. With the passing 4 episodes on I found it&#039;s story interesting because it talks about how this dude, our MC goes around Ikebukuro to solve all of it&#039;s problems and all. the characters are good but they don&#039;t really catch your interest in them.<br />
<br />
     I technically heard this from Joey (The anime man, which you should subscribe and like his videos) as he sung praises of it, I felt excited about it, but when it came out

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361813">
        I just didn&#039;t feel for it. (I will be continuing to watch it and see how it goes never know when you might get that one episode which changes your perception of it)<br />

    While the anime is about two gangs in Ikebukuro, you could be very mislead if you think that the&quot;gangs&quot; in the anime are gangs of criminals or actual Yakuza. The term gang definitely has a negative connotation, but in this series a gang is merely a group of people, that protect each other and can be hired for certain services. It actually shows that a gang can also be a good thing. Even though the gangs in the series become agressive very quickly, which is definitely a flaw that they still have, their main intentions are to make their district a better place and provide

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370311">
        security for thir members. <br />
<br />
I think this concept was very interesting, but the thing that definitely carried the show the most was its Main Character. The outside perspective that he has on these gangs gives the perfect angle to narrtate the story, which is honestly otherwise not that great. His role as problemsolver shows what a genuinely good guy he is. He helps people just to make sure as many of the citizens of Ikebukuro as possible are happy. And the thing that deifferentiates him the most from alll the other &quot;good guy&quot; characters is that he neither brags with his good deeds, nor does he talk excessively about his philosophy. He just helps people because he wants to and doesn´t make a big deal out of it. But he has also a very impressive side to him, which he shows in the way he solves all the problems he is confronted with. The way he makes use of his connections to all kinds of people (including the gangs) and his way of thinking make him a very cool and admirable character. <br />
<br />
That alone managed to make the series great for me.

    Now.... For the silly sausages that are giving this a low rank, its mainly because you was mislead by the trailer and tags.<br />
IWGP was hard to judge on what sort of anime it would be, based off the trailers shown and provided to us before release, as so, it shocked me. I was expecting fighting every EP, however this was not the case.<br />
Each EP provided different stories to the viewer, lore and also emotional attachment to each character.<br />
The last few episodes is where it all kicked off, and left it open for a second season.<br />
Yes i agree, in some stories provided, it seemed rushed (

        information leading up to the reason WHY was missed out for the viewer ). But in general some of the stories was funny and incredible. <br />
I would highly recommend giving this show a watch, as it was one of my favourites of 2019.

    With Fall 2020 coming to a close and having seen all the anime I wanted to see, Ikebukuro West Gate Park (IWGP) was not of the initial anime I thought about when entering this season. I pretty much only started watching it when episode 10 aired after a friend told me he was watching it and I decided to give it a shot after reading the synopsis. Here&#039;s my review of Ikebukuro West Gate Park.<br />
<br />
This is my first review on MAL after 4 and a bit years of using this site and I know I wanted to write one about this anime because I honestly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369261">
        enjoyed the episodes I watched. Essentially, IWGP follows our mc Makoto Majima who lives in Ikebukuro and he is the Mr. Troubleshooter, going around fixing different problems. Makoto is involved with the leader of the biggest gang operating in Ikebukuro, King (Takashi Ando) and he helps them out as well while not officially being part of his gang which is called G-Boys.<br />
<br />
What I think IWGP does well in is the representation of the gang life, which I found to be relatable, as I come from an area with prominent gang activity and basically being like Makoto outside of the fact that I don&#039;t risk my life doing half the stuff he does. It&#039;s so common to see youths getting revenge on their opposition because one of their own got attacked/harmed in some way and IWGP shows this happening consistently with the turf wars between the G-Boys and the Red Angels (the main rival gang) and the G-Boys getting back at the antagonists of the episodic structure IWGP uses with Makoto dealing with different individual&#039;s problems. So yeah I enjoyed that.<br />
<br />
Like any series or medium, IWGP does have its cons, which I don&#039;t think are game changing, but hold it back from being a super good anime to me in my opinion. I mentioned earlier about IWGP&#039;s episodic structure of Makoto being handed a problem he has to solve and the episode is spent with him resolving that issue. That is all fine and dandy to me but the synopsis does not highlight this at all, when that&#039;s how the majority of IWGP. That is not the fault of the anime, but by the person/organisation that wrote the synopsis. The event where Makoto &quot;losing a loved one&quot; and the &quot;rising tide of violence&quot; doesn&#039;t even happen until the latter episodes, when the synopsis makes it seem like that&#039;s the series is going to focus on, I don&#039;t know, just lets my expectations down a little bit. I feel like they could&#039;ve spent much more episodes on that conflict when at this point, we&#039;ve seen a good amount of how and what Makoto does in Ikebukuro so we didn&#039;t need more &quot;Hi Makoto, I got a problem for you to solve.&quot;<br />
<br />
Concluding here, Ikebukuro West Gate Park was a fun watch for me, I enjoyed Makoto solving problems throughout his town and how he deals handling with the chaos that ensues in Ikebukuro&#039;s ongoing gang activity. I&#039;m now obsessed with the opening which slaps.

    Mediocre at best.<br />
<br />
I was hyped for this anime as I thought it would add to the already great original show, but what it did instead was dilute everything into a shallow narrative lacking any form of character or significant (and believable) development.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please watch the original IWGP, and not this Netflix-like adaptation which takes the names and location, and then changes everything after washing off every bit of interesting parts the original TV show had.<br />
<br />
Imagine you have your favorite anime, e.g. AoT, then you think &quot;Right, let me check out the action movie&quot;. You finish watching it, big yikes.<br />
This is how it goes for the IWGP

          <span style="display: none;" id="review366144">
        anime, but this time it&#039;s the &quot;live&quot; TV show that&#039;s the good part. Again, go watch it, much better.<br />
<br />

    The main reason for writing this review is to get people to give this show a try. Right of the start, let me be clear - it&#039;s by no means extraordinary and a must-watch, but I do think you shouldn&#039;t just skip it without giving it a try.<br />
<br />
Story 7/10<br />
The story revolves around street gangs in Ikebukuro, with the main protagonist Makoto Majima not really belonging to any of them (even though he is the best friend of the guy leading one of the gangs).<br />
<br />
Each episode so far (5 episodes as of writing this review) is a stand-alone one in terms of story, but I wouldn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363293">
        be surprised if some of them connect in the future episodes.<br />
<br />
That being said, the main tone of the stories is exploring social problems, such as bullying, overworking, discrimination, drugs... A person with a problem approaches Makoto and asks for help. The solution to the problem at times may be obvious, but the process of getting to the goal and social interactions are in the focus. Each problem is presented from several perspectives which really gives it some depth and room for thought, which is the main thing getting you invested in the show. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art 8/10<br />
The art style fits the setting. Characters have a nice and distinct design and there is some fluidity and natural feeling to their movement. The animation is consistent and at the level you&#039;d expect for a seasonal anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound 8/10<br />
While there are no soundtracks that really stand out, every scene is accompanied by a fitting one which I find most important. As an analogy, imagine sitting in a bar with someone you want to hang out and have a chat. The ambient music is welcome for the mood, but you don&#039;t want it to be distracting you from the conversation. Well, in the same sense, this music here fits just right. It gives the right vibe to the scenes, without really standing out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character 8/10<br />
It&#039;s early in the anime, and already we have a lot of characters and each one from the main cast had some development or small side story. There are quite a few very charismatic characters and I look forward to seeing more of them. I like the approach of developing characters through specific situations, instead of just giving a backstory for each individual character.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 8/10<br />
Regardless of the mood I find myself in at the time of watching the episodes, I enjoy watching them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall 8/10<br />
<br />
There are a lot of shows coming out this season, and I wouldn&#039;t really say that this one stands out as something special, but the same could be said about a lot of the other ones as well. I feel that the overall quality of anime has skyrocketed in the past few years, making the standards higher then they should be.<br />
<br />
I personally try to judge the anime I watch in the context of what it wants to accomplish, and not by comparing it to others, as I really think that each story is it&#039;s own thing and can&#039;t be easily compared to another one. Basically, it&#039;s just a matter of expectations. I have certain expectations for the show I&#039;m watching based on how much potential the initial setting provides. If I feel like the potential is well used, I consider it a job well done, regardless of how it fairs to other anime.<br />
<br />
That being said, I look forward to seeing how the story will develop and am pleased with the current progress.

    Ikebukuro West Gate Park (IWGP) was one anime I was really looking forward to watching. The synopsis sounded amazing. Quote: &quot;Crime-ridden Ikebukuro is a haven for violent gangs, the Yakuza, and home to Makoto Majima -- when a rising tide of violence results in Makoto losing a loved one, can he ride out the storm, or will he drown in all the spilled blood that floods his streets?&quot;<br />
<br />
Does that not sound amazing? Gang warfare, intrigue, mystery, blood and violence. Complicated criminal and gang activities while following the perspective of a 3rd party. And while there were certainly moments that had aspects of this, they&#039;re incredibly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369302">
        watered down. To the point of near non-existence. And what little there was had such wasted potential. It wasn&#039;t bad, but there&#039;s very little I could recommend. Very much style over substance, and it will not leave a lasting impression.<br />
<br />
In summary, I would not recommend this anime. It&#039;s mediocre personified at best and a let down at worst. For a spoiler free explanation and recommendation for similar anime, please continue reading.<br />
<br />
From what I understand, IWGP was an urban mystery novel produced in the late 90&#039;s. And again going by the synopsis I figured this sounds like a great premise for an anime. My major worry however came when I read the synopsis above, and saw the show with no rating (I believe this has since changed to PG-13). There was a massive disconnect to what was happening in the show and what the description of both the original novel and anime. Ultimately this had led to the disappointment that most will feel when thinking back on this show. This however was not the only negative I found when watching. The actual structure of the anime was in my opinion, lacking. For a 12 episode anime I was expecting rather tight story telling. But after finishing I feel like I&#039;ve watched 9 episodes of fluff and filler (emphasis on the fluff as a lot of these episodes completely contradict the synopsis), and barely 3 episodes of the main story. And I say the story very loosely as most of it was pushed through in post episode narration. A lot of it was told at the end of an episode through exposition and flash forward. There was no time given to reflect or to think about what had happened and effects these may have. But worse is that most episodes had no lasting effect or any play in future episodes. It was very episodic in nature.<br />
<br />
Further to this, it felt like the story was shrink-wrapped down and only the bare minimum was allowed to seep through the cracks. There is a wide cast of interesting looking characters. Perhaps in the novel these are expanded upon but in this show they are mostly for window dressing. I couldn&#039;t really tell you any of their names other than the MC, and even the ones that appear more regularly are not given any time to be fleshed out or explained. At most, they are just there to turn the tide over while the story is told around them. There was a lot of wasted potential here.<br />
<br />
I wouldn&#039;t say the entire show was bad. The art direction was OK with interesting characters and the show had a catchy intro and outro. That being said I wouldn&#039;t say there was anything standout, and any BGM playing throughout the show is forgettable. <br />
<br />
In all I was hoping for a lot more but in the end they were all dashed. I was hoping for an in-depth look at interesting characters in a gang warfare setting. There was very little of that latter and the parts we got to see were not that interesting. I was hoping that the episodic and sporadic nature of the show would come together for an amazing ending. While it did try to do that with the final 2 episodes, it again felt rushed and wasted compared to what it could have been.<br />
<br />
I can not recommend this anime to anyone interested in it unless they have a lot of time, and even then I would likely say to watch something else. For an alternate recommendation I would go with:<br />
<br />
Banana Fish - Similar setting with gang warfare and intrigue, but a slower paced feel giving you time to breathe. A much better fleshed out story and overall more enjoyable while hitting all the notes I was looking for. <br />
<br />
Thank you for reading.

    I&#039;ll admit that I was a bit disappointed to how this show ended up turning out. I feel it had potential to be very good, but in the end, it didn&#039;t. That being said, this is still a decent show, that could potentially be enjoyable for many (either way, OP bangs, so at least check that out~)<br />
<br />
The story is relatively straightforward. We have our MC who is involved with a gang (but not actually a part of it). You get introduced to some interesting characters, and then you see some examples of the ways our MC helps Ikebukuro with the help of his connections that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369238">
        he has for some reason. Except that ends up being the entire show. Every episode, we get a new problem come up, or a new person to help, and Makoto (the MC) works to solve them. Rinse and repeat. Some of these solved issues end up being somewhat relevant in the future, in the sense that some character interactions develop, but that is essentially limited to small interactions. Their influence on the overall arc (which exists, don&#039;t get me wrong) is relatively small. Thus, this is essentially a slice of life, following someone that has a bit of an uncommon daily life. I will add that there are some pretty dark themes, which you may expect from a setting involving gangs, but it gets quite serious in some episodes, so keep that in mind. So at this point, you can gauge whether or not you would enjoy this. I was expecting this to be a longer story where we&#039;d be able to explore the setting and the characters because that was the vibe I felt from the first episode. If you are expecting something like that, then you&#039;ll be disappointed. However, if you go into this knowing that the format will in fact be essentially a slice of life, then you may get more enjoyment out of the show, because there are things to like about it.<br />
<br />
Because of the set up of the show, we don&#039;t end up with any actual fleshed out characters. Actually, that may be slightly wrong. There are actually some character development, but it&#039;s pretty much entirely reserved for the side characters who are helped in each episode. They may start with a problem, and develop and grow by the end of it. And then we don&#039;t see them again for the most part. But the actual main characters don&#039;t change much. They are pretty interesting, but we don&#039;t learn enough about them, so realistically, they end up being a bit bland. The setting itself was interesting, and there are many moving parts in the background that culminate in the final arc (which is two episodes), but I don&#039;t personally feel like enough was done in the setting.<br />
<br />
So, should you watch this show? If you&#039;re expecting a complex story and fleshed out characters, this may is likely to disappoint. However, if you&#039;re up for a sort of &quot;slice of life&quot; in a pretty unique setting (with gangs and some dark themes), then this is a pretty interesting show that does that.

    Ikebukuro West Gate Park, an anime taken from a novel that features a place rather than the people, or that&#039;s what it was suppose to be, but instead what we have here was more on Mystery and Drama, but romance????Well, all i can see her was more that Makoto and Takashi thing, were it was rather ambiguous if the two were in a gay relationship or just in a bromance kind of thing. So, enough of that:<br />

Story-Good 7: Well, if were to talk about the plot, there isn&#039;t any, cu&#039;z every episode has a plot of its own, and everything was on a certain character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369858">
        who serves as trouble shooter/ detective / informant, and yes we&#039;re talking about Makoto a guy who does all the work in not only order to keep both the reds and blues in check, but to solve cases that should be done by them cops. Thought good as it is the fact that as the protagonist, Makoto does all the heavy lifting, it was kind of a one sided thing that there is Takashi who seemly is wealthy would even both to run a gang , rather than focus on his business.   <br />
<br />
Art-Good 7: That score was for the illustration which has that life like appearance, but the sense of Makoto&#039;s fashion was more like a crime.<br />
<br />
Sound- fair 6: Thought it was good that the characters here weren&#039;t teen agers , rather young adults, it was kinda nice that the seiyuus who does them character&#039;s voices don&#039;t have to pretend to be young....though, I kind of hate both opening and closing themes.<br />
<br />
Character-Poor 3: TBFH, studio Doga Kobo, and original creator, Ishida Ira, basically revolve the story plot around Makoto, I mean, seriously and produce vendor who does the job of a private investigator / youth counselor/ informant  to two rival gangs and yes it&#039;s them reds and blues, I was kind of stupid that Makoto&#039;s bruh Takashi who has the resources and manpower to get the job of investigating would used Makoto who should be selling fruits and vegetables in his mom&#039;s stall instead of doing things that can be handle by the police ...IMAO, if Makoto would&#039;ve be doing those mentioned jobs, then maybe being a son of a produce vendor shouldn&#039;t be his role, instead original creator Ishida Ira should&#039;ve given made Makoto either as a Private Detective, Freelance Journalist, or a Youth Counselor who works with trouble teens, instead of having him in a role that was very much an oxymoron one. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment-Decent 4:TBFH, I really have mixed feelings about this anime.<br />
<br />
Overall- fair 6: TBFH, this was some anime where at one point you&#039;ll like it, but in another you&#039;ll hate it....the other good that this anime has was that it was given a clean ending. <br />
<br />
So Merry Christmas.

    Makoto is a guy that solve problems and protects Ikebukuro if it was in a trouble. <br />
This is it, if I could finish the review here I would but MAL wouldn&#039;t let me, so I will try to say more.<br />
King and the red angle guy are not likeable, Makoto isn&#039;t that bad but not so great either, so how can you make an anime that has no goal, no comedy, no story, and no characters a good anime idk, this is so mediocre to the point that I can make &quot;Ikebukuro West Gate Park&quot; as a reference to measure other anime, its in the exact

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369241">
        middle, not so low that its trash, or high that its good, when you watch it you say &quot;oh this is a problem&quot; and at the end &quot;That&#039;s a good way to solve it, oh well&quot;.<br />
Maybe the last 2 eps are good, but there is something generic and been done a lot of times in them so it is nothing special. I think the first 10 eps are preparation for the last 2 because the are not important and boring, just knowing new characters that are not interesting.<br />
 To conclude this essay, I don&#039;t recommend this if you want to watch some problems in Ikebukuro go watch Durarara!! its 100 times better, and it has many good characters unlike this one.<br />
Thanks for reading my perfect review of this anime and have a great day (probably your day will be better than mine).
