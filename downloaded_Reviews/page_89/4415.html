        series.  Covering nearly 60% of the available manga materials at the time the anime finished airing, there really isn’t any way for the production staffs to wrap up the story without ruining any chances for a second season.  For the record, the manga material is only two measly arcs ahead of where the anime finished at the time this review was written and the actual plot did not proceed very far.  <br />
<br />
I fully understand the complexity the anime brings to the new viewers who have no background knowledge from the manga.  Numerous terminologies coupled with even more numerous unfamiliar faces does prove to be quite difficult for one to digest at first.  Additionally the anime added tons and tons of boobs and nipples sprinkled everywhere in the show from the dormitory room change scenes to intense battles scenes. In short, there are bound to be boobies for the unprepared!  Thus this served as another excuse for viewers (even loyal manga readers) to detest and despise the show.  Even I have to admit it would have been better if the staffs can use those boobies air time to produce something more constructive like elaborating on certain flashback stories or further develop some characters and their personality or background.  So let this be a fair warning to all you potential viewers, only watch this show IF you can stomach the fan services and accept the fact that the story is a work in progress!!  With that said, let us finally turn our attention to introducing this anime for those of us who are still interested.<br />
<br />
Set in the near future, roughly 50 years from now, the world we know today has already been invaded by an alien race known as Nova.  Normal military is powerless in the face of this new threat and thus the world can only rely on girls with special tissues implanted into their backs (called Stigmata) to fight these unknown aliens.  These girls, known to the outside world as Pandora, fight in pairs with a younger boy, in order to neutralize a special effect cast by the aliens (called Freezing which freezes anything within the cast radius).  Now don’t quickly jump to conclusion just yet.  While this may sound like a military action genre to you, the story in actuality takes place in an academy where Pandora are being trained.  Following the school life of a second year sophomore, Satellizer el Bridget, the story introduces the problems and threats of the reality very (and I mean very) slowly to the point where one may end up asking more questions than there are answers to.  Thus to be fair, I would categorize the anime as ecchi, school life, romance with a fair bit of action, but nothing dramatic nor is it deep in plot (though the manga is getting there).  Without a doubt, the story department is the weakest one of all as all the emphasis so far is placed on the characters interaction.<br />
<br />
Characters.  Many many lovable girls with great looks and even better body proportions, albeit with a nasty attitude.  Yes! This is certainly not for the average female viewers!  In fact, the anime was never meant for the female audiences as evident from the trailers and even more evident as the series progress with all the boobie attacks on the screen.  With that said, the one major downside in the character department for this show is the fact that there are too many girls with not enough time to introduce them properly.  It will come as no surprise that you will likely be introduced to a new character in each episode and that the old ones will be brushed aside until close to the finale.  On the bright side, our main hero and heroine does have their own lengthy flashbacks and character development for us to “know them better”.  <br />
<br />
As a manga reader, seeing this series get animated with voice was wonderful.  Unfortunately it was not quite to my level of expectation in a few ways.  Firstly and perhaps the most obvious is the fact that the broadcast of the uncensored version is at a horrendous 4:3 aspect ratio (and please don’t bother with the censored version, you won’t understand a single thing).  Though it remains a mystery as to why the opening and ending animation are in 16:9.  The second disappointment, coming from a manga reader perspective, is the altered character looks which may or may not discourage some readers, but it was a disappointment nonetheless.  Lastly, and this I am sure is a common sentiment among all viewers, is the miscast voice acting role for Aoi Kazuya.  This voice will surely cause some damage to your eardrums. However, other than that one miscast role, it is fair to say this anime has a lot of strong seiyu in the cast.  Additionally, both the opening and ending them songs are extremely catchy and are few received by fans in general.<br />
 <br />
Overall I have mixed feelings for this anime.  It was a pleasant surprise when the news that Freezing manga was to be animated.  While the fan service ruined some enjoyment of the show for me, I must confess that in the short one-cour time frame I am quite impressed by the production studio with the amount of manga content they were able to include in the series.  Most notably the inclusion of certain subplots that really makes certain characters much more realistic and likable.  Staying faithful to the original material and introducing some anime-original contents as enhancements to the overall story made me very pleased particularly with the fact that the production studio did not opt for an anime original ending.  With that said, I still cannot recommend this series to those who does not enjoy watching ecchi series as this show clearly relies on boobies as its major selling point.  However, if the premise of the story does intrigue you then I highly recommend giving the manga a try.  Afterall Dall-Young Lim’s manga are quite well received in Korea, Japan, and even Taiwan.

    I freely admit that I have a guilty pleasure when it comes to silly ecchi action anime just like Freezing.  So initially at least I was quite intrigued with this series and for the first few episodes I was amused.  However that amusement soon waned as it was buried under it&#039;s dozens of characters, inane nonsensical plot, and confusing terminology and technobabble.<br />
<br />
The premise for Freezing seems like it might have had an enormous amount of potential.  Mysterious entities called Nova are invading earth intent on wiping out mankind.  All that stands in their way are special soldiers known as Pandora and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35872">
        their Limiter partners.  Our setting is a school/laboratory called West Genetics which trains future Pandora and their Limiters.  This is where that potential I was speaking of starts to get lost.  The Pandora are all, unsurprisingly all big breasted girls (hey this is anime after all!) and the Limiters are all guys.  Given that the Limiters are timid, weak, and mostly useless this is unsurprising and the only thing they really do is hide behind the skirts of the Pandora and yell &quot;Freezing!&quot; and other clichéd nonsense.  The girls on the other hand are violent and uncouth and spend most of their free time trying to kill one another or bully their underclassmen.<br />
<br />
Now since I have not read any of the original manga I can’t speak to how well this anime adapts its story.  Even if the manga has an amazing story (which I doubt honestly) it is completely lost in its transition to an anime.  Really nothing is adequately explained from what the Pandora are to what the enemy is or why or how they are even ended fighting.  Eventually by the end you do get some explanation and can make some conclusions from the action and context but this is a piss poor way to present a story to your viewers.  Additionally for pretty much two thirds of the series nothing of significance to the plot happens.  We get introduced to the lead, Satellizer el Bridget, learn a few snippets from her past, watch her take ALOT of showers, and get groped and bullied by the cunts and bitches she has as classmates and seniors.  And for about the first eight episodes that’s just about all that goes on.  What story there is remains unresolved with the ending.  Though it leaves the viewer with the impression that at least one additional season should be expected.  This kind of series always seems to get a sequel if it wants one so it’s really hard to hold the ending against it.<br />
<br />
For a series that is at its core about fighting, the overall action is a bit disappointing.  Don’t get me wrong, there is a lot of fighting but the majority of it is crammed into the last few episodes.  Most of the early fighting is uninteresting and more about tearing apart the girls’ flimsy school uniforms to expose their breasts.  If you enjoy exposed nipples and breasts then the world of Freezing should be like heaven to you. Like most fighting anime, the characters yell out lots of nonsense.  With Freezing most of it is mindless technobabble and engrish and little to none of it is ever explained.  While you can get the meaning from some of it through context it sure would be nice for the story to explain this to you once in a while.<br />
<br />
Like the story the characters are also a major weakness.  Neither one of our leads, Satellizer or the boy Kazuya are very interesting.  Kazuya is your typically weak and unremarkable anime boy with powers (unsurprisingly) far beyond your typical Limiter.  He has a special attraction to Satellizer that is both mysterious and due to the fact she reminds him of his dead sister.  I know shocking that someone should have a sister complex in anime right? (Pardon my eye rolling)  Satellizer, known in the school as the &quot;Untouchable Queen&quot; is a girl of dual personalities.  Her external persona is that of a cold and ruthless killer while her true personality is that of a meek and mild mannered girl with a fear of men.  Other than learning every inch of naked body through her regular trips to the shower or having her uniform torn off in all her battles we don’t learn all that much about her.  What is learned fits into the narrow stereotype her character has its basis in.<br />
<br />
The supporting cast is no different.  I seem to beat this point to death in an awful lot of the shows I review but the main issue with Freezing&#039;s cast is the sheer number of characters in the cast.  It is literally impossible to keep track of all the characters.  They bring in 2 or 3 a week, many of which looks almost identical to each other.  Their main purpose seems to be only to bully Satellizer who for some reason seems to really butt hurt them.  Even so, you’re likely to have at least a couple that amuse or even interest you just a little bit.  For me it was Rana Linchen who is a quasi-main but whose personality I enjoyed as well as having a pretty sexy character design.<br />
<br />
Artistically, Freezing is also weak.  For one the character models are absolutely ridiculous in most cases.  While I do like the &quot;full figured&quot; look, the extreme and impossible bust and waistlines really detract from the series.  Given how much tits and nipples are visible they really should have done a better job with this.  Everyone&#039;s figures are pretty much interchangeable and the actual animation of all the &quot;jiggle&quot; is really not that realistic or even appealing.  The color palette is very drab and depressing, with maroons, dark blues, grays, and blacks dominating the series.  The world is also incredibly dark and depressing.  While I am certain this is by design that doesn&#039;t explain why there is basically no sunlight at all and while they seem to be stuck in a world of eternal midnight.<br />
<br />
Freezing&#039;s voice cast is quite impressive as it seems to include almost every current seiyuu of note.  However this is a double edged sword as the reason it has so many is because the cast is so enormous.  Because of this none of the actors really gets a chance to shine.  Additionally Satellizer is horrible miscast with Mamiko Noto.  While I really enjoy her work and also seeing her portray a bit of a different character than she normally does (though also exactly the same) I just don&#039;t think her voice works for her character.  The music is solid but unspectacular action anime fair.  The OP is particularly exciting but also really drives home how ridiculous, Satellizer&#039;s in particular, chest measurements are.<br />
<br />
Even though I never really had any high expectations for it, ultimately Freezing is a failure.   I was hoping it would entertain me somewhere between other anime it has a lot in common with such as Seikirei and Ikkitousen.  But its lack of a coherent story, bland characters, and unappealing visuals make me unable to recommend this to anyone.<br />

    Have any of you played the Battle Raper series? Basically, it&#039;s just another ero-fighting game where most of the time two female characters fight each other and the main goal of some players is to destroy as much clothes as possible before actually defeating your opponent. <br />
<br />
So what does this have to do with Freezing? If you&#039;re still asking this question after watching at least an episode then clearly you&#039;re either still a cherry or you watch Mormon porn.<br />
<br />
If you understand where I&#039;m going with this then congrats! Your right hand is your best friend (or left for some of you) and the only reason

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34074">
        you stumbled upon this is because you finished jerking off to Sekirei and wanted more hot overpowered girls with wimpy guys. Lucky for you, Freezing has all that aspects!<br />
<br />
So the story is pretty simple. In the future, big inter-dimensional creatures invade Earth, hot girls used by the military to fight the battles for them (Yes, military men are all perverts ;) God bless you Uncle Sam!) and wimpy guys giving them orders. Right.. At least guys are still giving them orders.. That&#039;s all what we&#039;ve got in the future.<br />
<br />
So a young boy wit a japanese name (where as everyone has cool high class western names) Kazuya Aoi just transfered into one of the many Academy use to militarily train poor clueless students by robbing them of their adolescence. Now Kazuya is one lucky bastard. Because he got to see his elder sis naked before she died?? No you sickos!! It&#039;s because he is able to touch the prestigious &quot;Untouchable Queen&quot; of the academy without the risk of getting his balls chopped off.<br />
<br />
The artwork... Graphics are above average especially during combat scene and throw in a couple of panty shots and hundereds of &quot;Mune&quot; shots no one would be complaining. &quot;Im sick and tired with all these fanservice!!&quot; I know, I know... But this would probably never had cross your mind. Why? Because chances are you stumbled upon this review because you saw &quot;Battle Raper&quot; and instantly reminisce on your &quot;Semen scented days&quot;<br />
Combat music is top notch as well, sending &quot;chills&quot; through my spines. Get it? Chills? Because this anime is called &quot;Freezing&quot; Get it?? What? I&#039;m lame for making a lame joke??...Screw you guys.....<br />
<br />
So introduction of characters! I love this part when Im reviewing.<br />
<br />
Kazuya Aoi! Weak, but protective, lovable to all. A fine candidate for a harem male lead. Has a strong relationship BUT NOT TO THE POINT OF INCEST with his sister who died while fighitng one of those huge inter-dimensional beings.<br />
He blushes easily to any girl...seriously... ANY GIRL!<br />
<br />
Satellizer el Bridget! Strong in the outside, mushy in the instead. Apparently has a traumatic past and thus wont let any guys touch her except to Kazuya Aoi. <br />
<br />
Why is this so? Well, according to the&quot; Theory of Evolution&quot;, some males had develop into a new species named by the science community, &quot;Justinian Bieberious&quot; Im no expert on this matter, but Im guessing Kazuya Aoi is under this new species.<br />
NAHH... Im just kidding... The fact is Kazuya Aoi possess something that normally the female characters in the anime would only possess (wont spoil anything here)<br />
<br />
So other than those two, the rest of the cast are psychotic female warriors, a hot teacher, a hot nurse, another gay looking roommate, and powerless student council members.<br />
<br />
Overall, fanservice anime with hot girls fighting each other and/or giant inter-dimensional beings. If you&#039;re complaining why Japan is always making such repetitive animes its because you&#039;re probably not the targeted demography. Remember kiddies, animes are made 1) For Japan... after that 2) Rest of the world...<br />
This is one type of anime that will make you perverts go yay! when her clothes gets shred off and boo! when their clothes regenerate. So enjoy it while you can.<br />
<br />
Now, if you&#039;ll excuse me, I&#039;ve got some clothes to shred as well.. Damn.. Why do I always end up defeating the girl in battle raper before shredding her clothes?? Wait? Wouldn&#039;t it be easier to defeat her first then shred her clothes?? I mean, have you ever tried shredding clothes of an unconscious girl. Waaaay too easy.. Umm.. Not that I&#039;ve ever tried... REALLY!<br />

    Entertainment is a fickle thing. Everyone has different tastes and different opinions, so making a series that satisfies the tastes of every single individual who may come across the series is a fundamental impossibility. Although, the entertainment industry keeps tabs on what has been deemed popular all throughout the course of history, and if nothing else, they use it to their advantage. While certain aspects of entertainment may be popular, that does not always guarantee those aspects can improve the quality of a title. These things could be criticized as the intentional use of said aspects in order to draw in viewers and have them

          <span style="display: none;" id="review111321">
        pay for something they may not really be interested in. And what is debatably the most recognized aspect of this kind in the anime industry? Sex. Enter Freezing, a series that I would describe as the gold standard of what a title looks like when you only focus on the viewer&#039;s primal instincts, and the characters&#039; chests.<br />
<br />
The driving force behind the series called Freezing is a busty, young woman named Bridget Satellizer, who&#039;s reputation as &quot;The Untouchable Queen&quot; runs rampant among the other characters present at the university. With blonde hair, a different uniform from anyone else, and the biggest bust of the bunch, her role as the main character is set in stone, and it&#039;s apparent from the start. While there are other characters introduced before her, it&#039;s hard to recall said characters when comparing them to Satellizer&#039;s overall design. While she appears menacing and cold on the outside, she&#039;s actually cold and menacing on the inside as well. That is, until the appearance of the other central, yet less important character, Kazuya Aoi transfers into the school. From that point, Satellizer&#039;s image as &quot;The Untouchable Queen&quot; comes under fire, while a looming threat lingers in the distance.<br />
<br />
One thing about this series that I never understood was its priorities. This is part of my claim that this series is simply a combination of popular anime tropes. At one point, the series focuses on developing the relationship between Satellizer and Kazuya through the role of damsel in distress, as one of them is placed in a difficult situation, while the other rescues them (or attempts to) from their conflict. This is typical in shounen series and Super Mario games in particular. At another point, they focus on melodrama based on testing the bond between the two of them as new characters are placed within the plot. Then there is also the evident antagonist threat, those called Novas, that eventually become a threat to everyone involved at the school and the world. These creatures are written off as unknown creatures with unknown purposes, which may or may not be an excuse for lazy writing. The sudden shift from one situation to another is more distracting than anything, and it shows an unusual desire to move on from a certain plot point into something new, which may also be a result of lazy writing.<br />
<br />
Everything I&#039;ve said up to this point about the plot was basically underlying problems, problems that arise after digging deep into a title and finding nothing. But what isn&#039;t underlying is the inexplicable amount of fan service shown on the outside. Sex appeal and the violence. The strongest argument I can give to support my claim is the apparent focus on these two qualities. Throughout every episode, these two qualities make themselves known in almost every situation. Whether the situation stem from tension between characters, the closeness of partners or comic relief, Freezing finds every single possible excuse to show exposed breasts or unnecessary violence. And while the violence isn&#039;t as prevalent throughout the series than the skin, it still panders to the whims of the viewer, finding unreasonable excuses to have the characters duke it out and show off their exaggerated weapons and speed. While this may not be a problem, it starts to become expected. And to expect something before it happens takes the pleasure of being surprised by the creativity of writing out of the equation. And what does this series become memorable for? When someone or something repeats a certain action enough, they become what they do, and they&#039;re remembered for that reason alone. How do I remember Freezing? Fan service alone.<br />
<br />
Characters within Freezing are about as typical as the writing of the series. They display qualities similar to that of other characters from other series. Satellizer is a tsundere with a remorseful past. Kazuya is the equivalent of the male harem lead. Every other character serves to back them up. They each have one quality that defines who they are, and never develop past that. Their designs are a different story, however. Satellizer&#039;s appearance is memorable and does well to support the viewer&#039;s interest in her life and problems, if not her chest. The uniforms that all other characters wear are enough to draw interest, but some issues arise in the fact that they&#039;re either never in them due to fan service, and that their battle armor looks identical to it. Which, in turn, leads to the quality of animation, which is slick and shiny enough to keep even a sloth awake. The art is of higher quality compared to other titles released during that year, but doesn&#039;t take any risks to ensure a place in history. It&#039;s well done, but it&#039;s nothing different. And with the glorious amount of exposed sexual features, it&#039;s within my power to state that they&#039;re well done, but with how much it&#039;s shown, anyone would expect them to pay attention to detail.<br />
<br />
In a society where money is everything, it&#039;s easy to assume that titles like Freezing will be prevalent far along in the distant future as much as they are today. As long as sex and violence remains a popular spectrum in the minds of viewers and they use their money accordingly, these things won&#039;t disappear anytime soon. At this point, those against it have to at least applaud their durability throughout time. And to those who are so against it, perhaps they should take the chance to see how it can be improved in the future. Fan service is not a bad thing. It lets the viewer identify with the writer or writers of a title and provides them with evidence that these writers had them in mind. But that isn&#039;t to say that a series should only rely on fan service, as there are other parts to a story that need to be constructed in order to make a quality work. This statement is both controversial and a gateway to debate. A debate that I hope everyone will take seriously and will take into consideration when watching series in the future. What makes a title successful? Its revenue or its attention to quality? Freezing is a good example of this, as nothing of its quality outside of fan service could be considered good in any sense.

    I&#039;ll have to say, the reason I started this series is because the introduction summary reminded me of Ash and Pikachu XD. But besides that, Freezing is a definite different from anime i have watched so far. <br />
Please remember that this is my own personal opinion, whether you find it distasteful or outright wrong in your viewpoint, is your own valued perspective.<br />
<br />
Story: The story is original, although it has the overused theme of aliens coming to earth for reasons unknown other than destruction, a typical fanservice-harem anime was easily revealed when the main roles were given to sexy teenage girls with giant racks and fetishes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review101671">
        for younger boys. They attempted, and accomplished well to have a good amount of action and shounen aspects which I found the most blatant factor of why this anime was good. The amounts of ecchi were tastefully included, not shoved in your face at every scene, which is a plus, and the overall plot kept you guessing. Near the end however like many other short anime, was rushed dramatically, dropping the amount of effect it has on the audience. My guess was that Freezing never intended to have a second season, but did particularly well,which is why i look forward to it airing in October of 2013. <br />
<br />
Art and Sound: The animations for the Limiter&#039;s Freezing have to be my favorite, other than that the soundtrack complimented well with the scenes and the art was very good. Although giagantic oppai that are too large for reality do kind of disagree with me, they kept it fairly under control. Respect points for that. The action scenes were well done too,with enough gore to add effect, but not too much to make you lose your lunch, it was done thoughtfully.<br />
<br />
Characters: The personality traits is mainly what i look for in characters, that said,some characteristics were standard in all harem anime, but who can deny the desires of the audience =P. <br />
<br />
Overall i enjoyed this anime series and i recommend it to any that enjoyed similar ones such as, Pokemon (XD), Date a Live, Guilty Crown and possibly Angel Beats! fans.<br />
<br />
SPOILER<br />
The ending really got me hooked on expecting a second season.

    Well, review after just one episode isn&#039;t really good thing, but still I need to voice my opinion about it.<br />
<br />
Story (8/10)<br />
Story so far seems unchanged from original. Pandora is fighting against creatures called &quot;Novas&quot;. Only girl can become Pandora. Pretty convenient for fandom, right? Well, Media Factory at least thinks so.<br />
<br />
Art (7/10)<br />
I have nothing to complain about here. Graphics seems pretty good. There were few too bright scenes, but that is all.<br />
<br />
Sound (4/10)<br />
This is probably first time I have said so, but I NEVER saw opening so much NOT fitting into show as here. Song is not bad itself, but seeing it with animation made

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33588">
        me wonder if it was written for this show. Rest of sounds was decent. Background noice was just like you would expect it to be. Still this feeling after opening lingers in me...<br />
<br />
Character (9/10)<br />
Bridgett. &#039;Nuff said.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (2/10)<br />
TOO MANY PANTSU-SHOTS! There were quite few in manga too, but what we saw here was just disturbing. There is something as restraint. Some people should remember about that.<br />
<br />
Overall (6/10)<br />
I&#039;m dissapointed in this. After manga I was expecting something of at least decent quality and I saw what was done many times recently. Proving that fandom counts more than quailty.<br />
I&#039;ll update this review later, at this point there weren&#039;t many things to be said. At this point I can feel only dissapointment.

    This is my first review:<br />
<br />
Every once in a while, an anime comes along that you watch and wonder why you liked it so much.  Well, for myself this is one such anime.  The overall graphics and sound quality may not be as high as some of the new productions, but the story is very interesting. <br />
<br />
I only wish the anime was longer than 13 episode because only the surface of the story can be portrayed in such a short format; only a brief back-story to why the world is in its current state is discussed. <br />
<br />
With that being said, I really like the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34125">
        two main characters and the romantic feelings between then.  I like the idea of the super fine girl who no one wants to get involved with, due to her perceived personality and background, has an immediate reaction when she first meets the new guy, who may not look like much but definitely has that kinda hidden inner strength and swagger that any main guy should have in an anime.<br />
<br />
Although I&#039;ve only watched 4 episodes, I truly like the idea of the story and the development between the two main characters; I only hope the show continues in a good direction and doesn&#039;t turn to crape.<br />
<br />
The main negatives:<br />
 - graphics aren&#039;t the greatest, buy definitely aren&#039;t bad<br />
 - same with the sound<br />
 - some might say the intro is bad but who cares about the intro and ending credits anyway, I never watch &#039;em<br />
 - a little nudity never hurt anyone, but pointless excessive nudity can just get annoying, this show edges on too many pointless boob shots<br />
<br />
Maybe this wasn&#039;t the best review but I&#039;m sure the best thing I can tell you is that you&#039;ll either hate it or love it, hopefully it&#039;s the latter of the two.

    There are still a couple of more episodes to go and I have not read the manga version of this anime, so pls don&#039;t judge me, amigos. So, my rating for this anime is as follows:<br />
<br />
Story: Dreadful number 2.<br />
<br />
The story is about genetically modified girls called &quot;Pandoras&quot; duking it out with extra dimensional invaders called &quot;Novas&quot; which only appers at the frist part of the episode, flash backs and obviously on the last 2 episodes, but instead it has more to do with the Pandoras who engage in CATFIGHTS and a whole lot of ecchi.<br />
<br />
Art: Very Good 8.<br />
<br />
What can I say, I like the way

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34726">
        the chicas were drawn.<br />
<br />
Sound: Decent 4.<br />
<br />
No need for me to say anything.<br />
<br />
Characters: Fair 6.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s go over the charaters:<br />
<br />
Satellizer El Bridget - the infamous &quot;UNTOUCHABLE QUEEN&quot; she earned the reputation because she beat the crap out of every humbre who wants to be her limiter and whom also makes a dreadful mistake of touching her (except Aoi), she also doesn&#039;t take any crap from other Pandoras regaurdless of seniority. According to info, it is said that she was implanted with stigmata from Aoi&#039;s sister which may partly explain why she didn&#039;t instictily attacked Aoi when he touched her and later on develop a brother sister relationship with him, eventhough she doesn&#039;t want to perform a baptismal with Aoi she does wants to bond with him. She&#039;s born of noblity, but she also experience a rough childhood in the hands of her half brother molesting and abusing her, but she was saved by her elder half-sister. She&#039;s a regular at a Queen Burger stand in the school&#039;s canteen always ordering a lot of cheseburgers.<br />
<br />
Aoi Kazuya - At frist Satellizer avoids him, later on she takes his offer to be her limiter on the condition that they will not performed a baptismal, his realtionship with Satellizer is that of a brother and sister relationship. He&#039;s the only limiter who can use freezing without being baptize, him being close to has more to do with the respect that he earned from Satellizer for standing out for her even at the cost of his own life. Also according to info, her sister is also a Pandora who risked her life to save the reamining Pandoras from the Nova&#039;s onslaught, surprisingly his attraction to Satellizer has to do with her resemblance to his sister, who also goes by the name Aoi Kazuya.<br />
<br />
Clipton Arthur- who&#039;s is Roland Genessa&#039;s boy bitch and Aoi&#039;s friend, he&#039;s always seen with Hiiragi Kaho and one would mistaken him to be her Limiter.<br />
<br />
Mably Elizabeth - Satellizer&#039;s next opponent, I think.<br />
<br />
Linchen Rana - a tibetan Pandora who has hot&#039;s for Aoi.<br />
<br />
Fairchild Chiffon- she&#039;s the president of the west genetics student council, and may soon to be Sattllize&#039;s opponet.<br />
<br />
I have no words to say as to why the rating.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: a very good 8.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t ask.<br />
<br />
Overall: a fair 6.<br />
<br />
Hey, this anime is more about fanservice.<br />
<br />
the end.<br />

    After watching the first 10 of 12 total episodes, freezing has been more addicting and easier to watch than I expected. It does a lot of things I like, things that give a feel-good feeling (and I&#039;m not talking about the fanservice here, which is nearly constant, btw). It also mostly avoids some of the common annoyances of the action, ecchi, romance genres that tend to turn me off of a series. I&#039;ll explain all this in a moment.<br />
<br />
<br />
The setup:<br />
<br />
The underlying premise isn&#039;t anything special. You&#039;ve got a school that trains students solely for combat. The girls are powerful fighters with lots of abilities, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35275">
        they need the support of the boys for a special power that only the boys have called Freezing. This relationship generally requires compatible males and females to pair up and develop strong bonds (in other words, become close as boyfriend/girlfriend). Fine. Accept it. It serves as a good excuse to add romance and sexual tension to the ecchi, which is always a good addition to otherwise mindless ecchi.<br />
<br />
<br />
The story:<br />
<br />
The story isn&#039;t anything complex or unusual. While you might think the story is supposed to be about fighting aliens from another dimension, that really isn&#039;t the focus of the story. That part of the story is just developed slowly on the margins until the final episodes. In fact, the aliens don&#039;t become a factor until the 9th episode, as part of a multi-episode climax. Almost all the fighting before then is between the heroine (Satellizer el Bridget) and the other girls. And even though fighting happens in each episode, I wouldn&#039;t exactly say it is the focus of the show.<br />
<br />
<br />
#1 reason to watch, romance/tsundere:<br />
<br />
The focus of the story is mainly on the development of the romance between the main hero, Kazuya Aoi, and heroine, Satellizer. This is one of the feel-good aspects of the show I mentioned at the start of this review that I really enjoy. The heroine is a tsundere, not the kind that is violent and abusive, but rather the kind that is shy and normally a loner. She&#039;s actually feared by most of the other students and thought to be ruthless. But the Hero Aoi, who is a transfer student, is unaware of her reputation and so treats her kindly and without fear, which is new and unexpected for the heroine. This leads to all the cute feel-good stuff that usually happens with this kind of thing in anime (it&#039;s why we love tsunderes). Note: there is also some harem type romantic action from a competing love interest which sparks some jealousy, but it&#039;s mostly friendly rather than a bitchy cat fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
#2 reason to watch, hero and heroine being impressive/cool:<br />
<br />
Another feel-good repeated feature of the show that I really like is the way that the 2 main characters (who you&#039;ll probably be rooting for) continually impress others by greatly exceeding expectations. Much of the fighting involves other students trying to put them in their place and humiliate them, but they manage to turn the tables and be the ones doing the humiliating, and being awed and respected in the process. They are constantly showing us new, more advanced abilities that they shouldn&#039;t have. They take bravery, defiance, and perseverance beyond the limits. It&#039;s fun to watch. <br />
<br />
<br />
The fighting, not bad and possibly pretty good:<br />
<br />
I typically don&#039;t care for fighting-based anime. But I actually looked forward to the next daunting challenge each fight brought here. I didn&#039;t feel the fights were random or forced. I thought there was a very believable purpose to each fight. Each was nicely more epic than the last. Each had a distinct sense of progression and unique challenge. Thankfully, the fights aren&#039;t done in a corny shounen way where they yell and shout and it suddenly results in them being stronger. Instead, the battles are a bit more technical and skill-based rather than being based on grunting and getting pumped up mentally. They were pretty cool. The sound effects and music added positively to the coolness as well. The art wasn&#039;t anything spectacular, but I didn&#039;t think it detracted from the scenes either.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fan service:<br />
<br />
Of course, the show is absolutely full of fan service. I can&#039;t complain. I like it. It doesn&#039;t get in the way of anything. It&#039;s just there and can just as easily not be there without changing anything. All the girls look great. Boobs are larger than average, but not excessive. Though, I suppose I can complain about the one time early on that the hero sticks his face in the boobs of the heroine to hug her and is oblivious to how awkward that is. I don&#039;t like ridiculous stuff like that, but thankfully that is rare here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
<br />
The story is fairly typical. Not many surprises to be had there. The fighting is at least better than average. Fan service is there in force, if you like that. But the real draw for me was 1: the cute tsundere romance and 2: the awe-inspiring displays of raw talent and virtues from the two main characters as it gains them the respect and admiration of others. If these two things sound particularly appealing to you, and you don&#039;t mind fighting, fan service, or a background plot that spends most of the time being secondary to the romance and high school student based storyline, then I think you&#039;ll enjoy this. But if you are watching this for the alien storyline, you might feel that this other stuff just gets in the way.

    Screw this show!<br />
<br />
I found this show via an advertisement on a youtube. I mistook it for another series I&#039;d been looking for and watched the first episode and wow...I&#039;ll start by saying that this is easily one of the most shallow anime I&#039;ve ever seen in my life (And that&#039;s saying something). Characters with little to no unique defining qualities combined with a story that just copy and pastes cliches and settings from other anime come together for the sole purpose of showing breasts. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s a cross between Neon Genesis Evangelion and Sekirei (A less painful anime show that at least tries to hide its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review71045">
        intention). Don&#039;t believe me? The story is that in the future, the human race is under attack by a mysterious race of aliens/robots (Evangelion) and the only defense we have is a race of genetically altered super-girls who (Here&#039;s the Sekirei part:) depend on a respective male to reach their full power, or neutralize them. The latter act is called &#039;Freezing&#039;, yes that&#039;s where the title comes from, and yes it&#039;s incredibly stupid to call it that. From what I can gather, the actual act of Freezing plays a relatively small part in the show, it&#039;d be like if Star Trek was instead called &#039;Teleporting&#039;.<br />
<br />
I wont dare list the character&#039;s names, that&#039;d be insulting to my intelligence. This portion only furthers my point that the show exists for fanservice, and to exploit sexuality at every turn. For instance, the show starts with with a generic boy character meeting up with his long lost sister, who is one of the &#039;super-girls&#039; as mentioned above. After years of separation, he sees her and does what any flesh and blood relative would do, he puts his face between her enormous breasts and begins to motorboat her. I&#039;m not even kidding. At all. That&#039;s just the beginning.<br />
<br />
This show follows the Ikki Tousen logic (I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if these shows were somehow related, though I honestly don&#039;t know). By Ikki Tousen logic, I mean the moronic physics and laws like &quot;tap to a girl&#039;s stomach=shirt exploding&quot; and &quot;Bigger breasts=better female character&quot;. And I&#039;m not joking about the first law either. It&#039;s just like Ikki Tousen and Master of Martial Hearts, in that whenever there&#039;s a fight, if there&#039;s a girl involved her clothes come off immediately. And they&#039;re not cut off or burned off, that would make too much sense. Like the other two shows, the girl would get punched or hit with blunt force, and her clothes would just magically disintegrate. Looney Tunes has a stronger sense of physics than this!<br />
<br />
Surprisingly enough, this show actually has a somewhat interesting visual style. It&#039;s as if one of the animators just felt bad and decided to put forward actual effort. The backgrounds and designs of the robots are actually pretty good, and though the fight scenes are terrible, the attacks are unique and look pretty darn cool. The only part the visuals really take a turn for the questionable, I&#039;ll get to that soon.<br />
<br />
Everything else I forgot to mention: forgettable voice acting, forgettable music, forgettable everything else. And, the part of this show that absolutely fascinates me and perplexes my mind for hours on end, the detail of this show that will likely have anyone with sense scratching their heads: This is a show about tits. Yes, there&#039;s some alien invasion BS going on in the background but it&#039;s about breasts. Now, with that understood, why do the breasts in this show not have areolae? The boobs are huge and get a lot of screen-time, but there&#039;s no visible difference in color from the breasts to the nipples. It&#039;s like someone got a naked barbie-doll and put tiny little bumps on it. Now I probably seem like a serious pervert, but when you really look at the context of the show, you can&#039;t help but wonder why boobs are drawn this way. And normally I wouldn&#039;t care, but as I said, they&#039;re the only reason this show exists, and they&#039;re thrown in your face every couple of minutes. I think every female character has her bare breasts shown almost as much as her face, so with that said, why don&#039;t they actually look like breasts? Whatever, just another area Sekirei has over this show. And when Sekirei is better, you just know it sucks.

    Based on the first ten episodes of Freezing, I have come to the decision to write a quick review to give you an itch on what it&#039;s all about. For the impatient, this is an Ecchi anime with a fair amount of fan-service but equally as good characters and story. The art and animation is decent enough that it will not deter from the overall enjoyment of the anime and the characters each have backgrounds which are briefly explained at varying levels at some point. I enjoyed this anime, if you are a fan of... fan-service, then. Enjoy yourself ;)<br />
<br />
The story is pretty interesting, girls

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35114">
        and guys take on roles to use somewhat interesting abilities. It takes place in a school, from the eyes of a young male protagonist, based on the make-up of how the roles are set, it&#039;s normal to see younger males pairing up with older females. Considering the rating of this anime and the &quot;Ecchi&quot; tag, you can imagine what it&#039;s all about. It does however pick up a lot of depth towards the end, nudging you towards the edge of your seat in anticipation as more exciting events unveil.<br />
<br />
The art is pretty standard just as the animations are. Do not expect jaw-dropping visuals unless you&#039;re asking about the fan-service stills growing like mushrooms on your screen in-between each episode? Yeah, they&#039;re okay.<br />
<br />
The sound, there are a variety of voices you can hear. The soundtrack is actually very decent, which took me by surprise. You can expect some interesting orchestral spin-togethers and catchy Opening and Ending sequences.<br />
<br />
Characters are fairly well portrayed and as with any decent anime you get a good feel for each personality. Each major character has a varying amount of background information shown either in a flashback or self-introductory scene.<br />
<br />
But all in all, I enjoyed this anime and as said at the start you will enjoy it too if you are a fan of Ecchi. There&#039;s fighting, fanservice and plenty of cool-down time where you get to know the characters, as well as some pretty decent gripping action towards the end.

    Before I start this review I will say: I will try to keep this review spoiler free, and welcome to titsville.<br />
<br />
I have mixed feelings about this anime. There are some good aspects. However, if you decide to watch this, you are in for one hell of a ride, to hell. The combination of tits-for-brains characters and constant meaningless fanservice left me cringing and facepalming on multiple occasions. If you don&#039;t feel like reading my jumbled thoughts, skip right to the conclusion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Lets start with the good news. The story was actually quite interesting. Although it could have been executed much better, the story intrigued me enough

          <span style="display: none;" id="review192227">
        to watch until the end despite all the horse shit (which will be discussed later) that takes place from beginning to end. The season finale looked like it was going to be meaningful, but don&#039;t be fooled, it&#039;s a mediocre harem after all.<br />
<br />
There is one filler-like episode where nothing happens plot-wise. It&#039;s in this episode that you see exactly how boring this anime would be without the story. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
If you ignore the disproportionate tits and constant meaningless panty shots, the artwork is fairly decent. Most of the fight scenes are decent. Some of the action scenes seemed too slow and lazily drawn, but for the most part, they managed to keep the momentum going. <br />
( &#039;-&#039;)b<br />
<br />
This anime also contains some scenes of gore. Although it wasn&#039;t implemented the way I liked, at least it was a step in the right direction. An arm or leg falling off illogically here and there, very meaningful ( &#039;-&#039;)b (sarcasm). Aside from that, gore is decently implemented for scenes where the tits-for-brains syndrome doesn&#039;t kick in to overshadow the blood.<br />
<br />
I will now tell you about tits, because it seems to be the heart of the anime. Most of the important characters have over-sized over-sized tits. Not so bad right? Well they sure like to slap it on your faces :). What happens when someone gets slashed? They bleed right? Well in the case of Freezing, you constantly wonder where the blood comes from. When a female gets slashed, blood splatters and the cloth covering their tits shreds off. You will notice that the female shows no signs of slash wounds, her tits are conveniently uncovered and unscathed. You begin to wonder where the blood really comes from, them or their clothes? If you happen to like watching clothes (only around their tits) being torn off randomly and illogically during important and meaningful scenes, then this may be the anime for you. Along with that, they seem to think it&#039;s a good idea to slap in as many meaningless panty shots as possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters (I think this section has spoilers):<br />
<br />
The entire school staff in this anime seems to only consist of two or three tits-for-brains, because that is how incompetent they are. Despite chaos and earthquakes, teachers either are never there to resolve issues, or show up too late. For some reason they seem to only show up when it&#039;s inconvenient for the main heroine. FOR SOME REASON, the main heroine is always taking most of the blame even though it&#039;s painfully obvious who is at fault.<br />
<br />
There is a social hierarchy in the school between students of different grades. For some reason, most of the 3rd year students who are part of the cast are extremely stupid psychos. I wonder why they are not expelled from the school. I forgot, the staff members have tits for brains.<br />
<br />
Let me introduce you to the main villain of this anime, the main character (MC). Are you looking for an MC that surpasses the generic harem MC? Well look no further. Actually, you shouldn&#039;t look here at all, because the only aspect in which he excels is... stupidity. Take a generic harem MC, and replace his brain with rocks. Congratulations, your typical harem MC has evolved into Aoi Kazuya! It appears that this MC has no sense of common decency whatsoever. During times of crisis he gives out some cool speeches, and sometimes they even sound stupid. There isn&#039;t really much depth to this character. Make an MC, throw in some random &quot;cool&quot; speeches, make the girls love him for no reason, and don&#039;t forget the overdose of idiocy.<br />
<br />
Unlike the MC, the main heroine seems to be likable... at first. The main heroine was intriguing. I wanted to know more about her past and why she behaved the way she did. Oh I found out all right, that she is probably delusional. Her backstory contradicts the way she feels for the main character, and she seems to only act like that towards him for... hold on, there is no reason whatsoever. Go harem MC power ( &#039;0&#039;)/<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
For god&#039;s sake, stop moaning when you transform. Other than that, it seems pretty normal, except for the MC&#039;s annoying voice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
<br />
It pains me to watch a potentially good anime being destroyed by excessive fan service, illogical events and characters that lack common sense. Despite the horse shit, the story was interesting, the action scenes had momentum, the animations were decent (excluding fanservice), and the main heroine was interesting (until the later episodes that is).

    I think it goes without saying that the ecchi genre has a reputation for putting out shows that are of a lower caliber. The reason the Anime are associated with being such a low caliber comes from the fact that most of the ecchi genre places what possibly amounts to to much emphasis on the fan service.  That doesn&#039;t mean though, there aren&#039;t shows in the ecchi genre that actually have quality to them.<br />
<br />
Freezing, despite sharing similar attributes to Claymore, happens to be one of those Anime that stands out as having quality to the storyline despite being of the ecchi genre. Sure, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review50121">
        series has plenty of fan service, but none of it is forced and every shot is actually believable within the context of the story. There is no pushing “the willing suspense of disbelief for this story.” Every step is thought out.<br />
<br />
This includes the artwork and the characterization. All of the action scenes flow realistically, not to mention this is one of those shows that as I&#039;ve said before, due to the subject matter, would be hard to pull off without the ecchi moments. On top of this, the female characters aren&#039;t degraded into being mere eye candy for the main protagonist and his friends to ogle over and have to protect because they are girls. No... the girls are allowed to stand on their own two feet.

    &#039;Freezing&#039; is an anime that people will approach from several different angles. There are the people that will be watching for the outrageous fight scenes,  and others will watch for the ample fan service. What surprised me at the conclusion of the show was that I thought back on the series as, first and formost, a futuristic apocalyptic tale in the same realm of subject matter as Neon Genesis Evangelion. It is a return to the subjects of a show that created a surge of more adult-themed stories and content in anime. Every rose has its thorns, as the show itself says, so let&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review42465">
        delve into the components of &#039;Freezing.&#039;<br />
 <br />
Story: I will try not to give away the best bits! Basically, the story revolves around a highschool-aged group of female superstrong Genetics soldiers and their slightly younger male partners, whose power combined is just enough to fight Genetic&#039;s greatest foe, the Nova. Right from the beginning, this show flaunts the extreme violence that comes with training for war. We meet the main characters, Sattelizer and Kazuya just as a &quot;carnival&quot; (read: masochistic annual tournament) is wrapping up, with Sattelizer as the heavy favorite in the second years. The late transfer student and the secluded, tormented fighter makes for a great story of reconciliation and selfless love. We get to see the characters as they fight over school politics, war partners, and each other&#039;s hearts. The story has a tendency of showing emotions through protracted fights rather than dialogue, and there were a few points where I just wanted to shove two characters in a room and make them talk. It&#039;s frustrating when the source of drama is sometimes just silly miscommunications or assumptions, but I guess these fighters and defenders of the earth are a tad egotistical and self-involved. It comes with the territory.<br />
 <br />
By the time you&#039;re wondering just where the show will go with its fleshed out leads, a large attack befalls Genetics, and Sattelizer and Kasuya find themselves right in the middle. The emotional plot really does play into each character&#039;s effectiveness as a fighter, which makes the story much more enthralling. I loved the last four episodes. They were dramatic, had some great twists in the fight, and generally made the show. The stakes feel high in the battle, and I was caring for the different characters, as their survival did not seem to be assured. Now, here&#039;s some not-so-sweet news: there is a good amount of boobs and poses thrown into this anime, and though it is almost always related to the fights (as their ever-shredded stigma fabric suits are indicative of their condition), some will see this as gratuitous and pointless. And as I said before, the fights can last quite a while, robbing the viewer of more character development or general setting about the outside world.<br />
 <br />
Animation: The character designs for everyone is great. We see many nationalities at Genetics, and it actually shows some in their look. Also, every Pandora&#039;s a babe, and you will be seeing many a pair of fight-revealed titties (for better or worse, this show is a kind of ecchi), and if it&#039;s important to you, they are quite the mammaries. The fighters use a variety of tactics and weapons in their fights, and oh are the fights extraordinary! Great animation paired with a visceral feel of classmates/comrades fighting all out (thank goodness for their magical hospital!) makes for exciting fights that feel like they have lots of power behind them and real consequences. Both the fights and the more dialogue-heavy scenes are well-animated, with good, strong emotions coming through with most of the characters. CGI is used for some of the special moves in a way that blends well with the drawn characters and enemies.  It looked like it belonged in the fights, and I think that&#039;s the best compliment I could give. Blood and gore are present, but never gratuitous, and the expressions of pain that comes with each hit looks the part. Settings can sometimes be bland-- the school is pretty, I guess, and the city in the last arc does give off a futuristic vibe, but sets in the Genetics compound and during fights are dark and spartan. This is a more generic future than NGE&#039;s Nerve center, and the beautiful landscapes of that world. The most important parts, though (the characters, the fights, and the enemy design) come out as the focus, and these elements more than make up for the lack of pretty sunsets.<br />
 <br />
Sound: The OP is fairly good, and this is coming from a chronic skipper. I found myself humming along often, and the montage during the song is a good overview of the characters and their job: kicking ass to protect the world. The ED is more techno, and has stills behind it rather than animation, but it&#039;s still a catchy tune. The soundtrack is usually servicable techno, some piano. It gets the job done. I thought the seiyuu performed admirably. Sattelizer and Kazuya are well-done by their respective actors. There&#039;s a &quot;rural&quot; character in the show, and her dialect sounds different even to me, a complete japanese newb. Everyone has great force behind their lines during fights, and especially at the end. Overall, a great and even effort. Also, the sound design for the fights and Nova are great. The special moves really pick up intensity when their sound effects give some weight to the punches and slashes. Oh, and that sound the Novas make? It&#039;s really creepy and scary. The sound helps make these behemoths seem menacing and frightfully dangerous.<br />
 <br />
Characters: The crux of this show is the relationship between Sattelizer and Kazuya, and as they draw closer to each other, both of them have to look back on their lives and their motivations to fight before they can handle a Nova fight. Sattelizer had a traumatic childhood, but in the beginning, all you can think is &quot;ice queen&quot;. Who better to thaw the Untouchable Queen&#039;s heart than Aoi Kazuyah, the brother of the deceased hero of the last Nova war? There&#039;s plenty of meat on these characters, and seeing Kazuya&#039;s iron will and its affect on Sattelizer makes for good drama, most of the time. It seems like they pulled the rug out from under our feet at the end, though. We never get to see the result of them caring for each other, this &quot;baptism&quot; of sorts, which cheapens the conclusion of the series, in my opinion. Though the other, secondary characters also have varied and refined personalities, the focus on fights and the main two mean that you&#039;ll be left reading info cards after the commercial breaks to learn about the other fighting vixens. Lana, Ganessa, and Chiffon are all great personalities to have around Sattelizer and Kazuya, but I just wish I knew more about their stories. In the end, the characterization are meant to lend emotional power to the action climax of the show, and for all my complaining, it worked!<br />
 <br />
So there you have it. I started watching for the fight scenes and boobs, and ended up staying for the exciting, world-in-the-balance conclusion. This is an adult anime that eschews the ditzy humor of most ecchi for a serious sci-fi story of love and sacrifice. About the 20th time a blade cuts of a girl&#039;s clothing but not her skin, you realize that fanservice is a big part of the show, but by no means is it the biggest. If you can&#039;t stand these parts, ask yourself what the difference is between this and the naughtier bits of Rome, True Blood, or Weeds. Adult shows have some T&amp;A, get used to it and just watch the censored version if you&#039;re too boob-shy. There are some niggling issues with bland-ish settings and Sattelizer&#039;s crushing inability to talk to Kazuya about important things in a normal manner, but these are all small imperfections on a generally good, sometimes great futuristic sci-fi action series. With tits.

    I haven&#039;t read the manga yet, so my review will be based solely on how I enjoyed the anime. <br />
<br />
Story/6<br />
I shamelessly love the aliens-are-invading-lets-genetically-modify-teens-and-putem-in-a-school plot. I found that the Nova weren&#039;t really focused on at all until the last episodes, but the first half of the series was entertaining and flowed nicely. The story line is episode-by-episode for the most part but easy to keep track of. <br />
<br />
Art/4<br />
The characters were physically distinguishable - if only by hairstyle for all the redheads but I mean. The breasts were unnatural and vaguely uncomfortable to look at, since they more like resembled balloons that jutted outwards. Ehhh. All

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180118">
        in all I didn&#039;t find the art particularly unique, pretty average. <br />
<br />
Sound/8<br />
I watched the English dubbed version  and I loved it! The voice actors were well matched to their characters. It was pleasant to listen too, nothing felt phoney or forced. I highly recommend the dubbed version! <br />
<br />
Character/7<br />
Satella&#039;s whole character was really admirable to me. I realize that she might be viewed as cliche, but when we were given her backstory and then guided through her character development it was so easy to sympathize with her. Her never-give-up personality makes her fun to root for. She&#039;s a strong female character who is finding genuine affection and companionship for the first time. It made me like Kazuya&#039;s character as well, since he was the one who was the first to fight for her. I found the two of them very likeable and of course it made the series that much more enjoyable! <br />
<br />
Enjoyment/7<br />
This isn&#039;t a cute, fluffy series to watch if that&#039;s what you&#039;re looking for - but if you&#039;re looking for a short series with lots of action, that ecchi element, and some interesting characters, I would say give this a shot :)

    I&#039;ll be completely honest here; I&#039;m utterly and completely biased in favor of this series. Ever since I&#039;ve seen the first episode, I fell in love. The series has some amazing characters, with unique traits, fears, dreams and aspirations that made the characters easily lovable and connectable. The series also includes some great humorous scenes and acts, some great romance sub-plots and plenty of action.<br />
A little warning though, despite all the said above in favor of the series, the series&#039; storyline tends to get somewhat confusing if you don&#039;t pay enough attention to the details, and there&#039;s some new and nifty terminology to it that

    Freezing is a true embodiment of what makes shounen, well shounen. A butt load of action, and a lot of naked butts to go with it. Of course, that is a very simplistic and &#039;large in identity&#039; assumption of me, but that is the type of eye candy we usually get. I have to say, despite my open distaste for fanservice, I have to admit that Freezing is pretty good at hitting the sweet tooth it aims for.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of things that work against this show; firstly the plot is very slow and somewhat shallow as every girl, in this academy pandora, decide

          <span style="display: none;" id="review39609">
        they want to pick a fight with Satella. Despite it being faithful to the manga, the ending arc which has actual relevance to the setting seems as if they just wanted to have some actual plot. While it is nice it has a lot of action, this is what ends up limiting the story of the show.<br />
<br />
The action is solid and pretty enjoyable, and it damn right should be seeing how it takes up some much screen time. I wouldn&#039;t be wrong to judge that at least a third of the show is spent with weapons drawn. The girls each have their own special pandora weapon and after watching the opening battle you know that nobody is pulling their punches as the blood rains down.<br />
<br />
Of course our female lead might be a little uptight and tsundere, but her background fully justifies her behavior, and allowed me to sympathize with her a lot. The same can not be said for our pathetic cliché male lead. He is completely stupid and head over heels for Satella, but unfortunately we can&#039;t have a bad lead right? So they made him the most powerful limiter* in existence - The pandora&#039;s male companion who can use &#039;freezing&#039; to stop the enemy movement. This is another shounen aspect in case you weren&#039;t wondering, where the main character pulls tricks out of his butt without having any idea why he is special. The rest of the pandora&#039;s we meet are average characters without much depth, but they aren&#039;t horrendous either.<br />
<br />
<br />
Freezing is an okay watch if your looking for something that is easy to follow. It doesn&#039;t have very good characters or story, but it maintains a high level of enjoyment despite these weaknesses.

    If you are reading this because you have not yet seen this anime and are trying to see whether or not this is the right show for you, then please keep in mind that this review is of my own opinion that may differ from you own, so keep your own personal tastes in mind. If you have already seen this anime and are reading this then you&#039;re kind of just along for the ride.<br />
<br />
Story/Characters:<br />
The story for freezing is set in a semi-futuristic world where humanity is under threat by inter-dementonal aliens called Nova and young girls; augmented with superpowers named Pandora are tasked with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186459">
        fighting them (Read the synopsis).<br />
Freezing from the very get go has a pretty solid concept and story with a few sci-fi things sprinkled here and there and enough lore to flesh things out and in fact the story is probably one of this anime&#039;s strong points, but if only it could focus on that all the time. This anime; being included as Ecchi has it&#039;s fair share of fan service and occasional female nudity, I&#039;m just letting you know so this doesn&#039;t come as a surprise.<br />
Despite all of that the story alone still holds it&#039;s own with some consistent action sequences featuring some pandora vs pandora combat. It&#039;s doesn&#039;t have the greatest story in the world but this anime defiantly had me watching one episode after the other and I wasn&#039;t disappointed.<br />
<br />
As for the characters, the characters to some extent were a little weaker than the story but with some exceptions. Kasuya; the leading male protagonist didn&#039;t seem all that interesting to me, sure most of the story was seen through his eyes and there were a few things we got to learn about his character and he develops a good working relationship with Satellizer the Female MC but he unfortunately still came off as a little dull to me. Another character that&#039;s kind of weak (in writing) was Rana who comes in later in the series, Rana&#039;s only real purpose in the story seemed to be to create a love triangle between the main characters and despite proving useful sometimes, this anime really could have done with out her.<br />
To end this section on a good not Satellizer; the Female MC I mentioned before, was probably the best character in the whole series, and that&#039;s something I don&#039;t say lightly. This character is introduced as a badass with a hard exterior and prefers to have people at arms length. I won&#039;t say anything more other than that there is a lot more than what is seen on the surface, which is uncovered over the course of the series.<br />
<br />
Art/sound:<br />
The art and animation is another strong point in this anime, the action sequences were really well choreographed and character designs were really good, especially for the female characters.<br />
The music though I don&#039;t remember any of the particular tracks from the OST was pretty solid for the most part.<br />
<br />
Sub/Dub:<br />
Honestly I wouldn&#039;t really suggest one version over the other for this anime, though I will mention that Funimation did a pretty good job with the dub, as for watching it subbed, I had a pretty similar experience with it, so my suggestion would be to go with what ever you feel comfortable with.<br />
<br />
Final Verdict:<br />
I&#039;m going to give this a 7 out of 10, this anime isn&#039;t perfect with all it&#039;s fan service and love triangles but I have to give credit where credit is due and say &quot;hey, this wasn&#039;t half bad.&quot;<br />
I would almost suggest watching this if you want to see something with fanservice for the sake of watching fan service, that way you also get a good story out of it as well.

    Freezing is without a doubt one of the best anime s i have ever seen. as simple as that the story the use of voice actors and the collaboration of sound effects. makes it incredibly enjoying. This anime has gotten me even more worked up then clannad did. Every week im just itching to find out what happens

    First of all I have to say this, this series is really underrated!<br />
It should be at minimum #500, and not #1794.<br />
<br />
The story is pretty exciting, you wont get bored for sure.<br />
Its actually about a Pandora girl &quot;el Bridget, Satellizer&quot; who doesn&#039;t want to be touched by anyone because of the trauma she had in her past. But then she gets to see a boy called &quot;Aoi, Kazuya&quot;. She starts to get feelings for Kazuya and let him touch her body, normally she nearly killed people who touched her. After that Kazuya wants to be her Limiter but she is too shy to accept and confront

          <span style="display: none;" id="review90193">
        Kazuya, that&#039;s actually how the story starts...<br />
<br />
So every Pandora girl has an Limiter, except for Satellizer due to her trauma. Normally to fight the enemy Nova, the girls need Limiters who can Freeze the enemy movement. That is only possible if those both partners have done the Baptism (joining). But Kazuya is able to Freeze without the need of Baptism, like his sister &quot;Aoi, Kazuha&quot;. <br />
<br />
So actually its pretty interesting how the story continues, I really enjoyed this series, hope there will be an Season 2 in future, the ending was open.<br />
<br />
======<br />
<br />
Now about the rating, <br />
<br />
Story 8, is very interesting and enjoyable!<br />
<br />
Art 7, the art could have been better, but still its pretty decent!<br />
<br />
Sound 9, the sound is very good, the effects/fighting sounds are really good, soundtracks was very nice, I really liked the Nova screaming sound!<br />
<br />
Character 9, nothing to tell about it, characters are awesome!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9, really enjoyed it, no boring episodes or childish stuff.<br />
