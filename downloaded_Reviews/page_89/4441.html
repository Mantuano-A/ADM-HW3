    Battle game in 5 seconds. I haven&#039;t read the manga and I came in with absolutely no expectations just hoping for a show that would pass the time. Man it didn&#039;t disappoint.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind I extremely enjoyed Darwins Game and this season is practically identical to it and it has kept me intrigued this whole time. So from the very start of this series I immediately enjoyed the series. The story is very similar to that of darwins game with people gaining random powers in order to survive the events that are taking place. It&#039;s a pretty cliché story but it&#039;s one that I tend

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411134">
        to enjoy quite a lot no matter how much it has been repeated. <br />
Story 7<br />
<br />
Mc is cold but kind at the same time so I like him. He&#039;s also pretty smart and can understand situations making him an mc that isn&#039;t obnoxious or annoying. Side characters are alright I guess<br />
Character 8<br />
<br />
Overall always rate with how much I enjoyed the show as my main concern and I so far have really enjoyed it.<br />
Enjoyment 10<br />
<br />
I can see why some people might not enjoy it but I sure did<br />
Overall 9<br />
I recommend you at least give it a try

    The survival game genre feels like a disease that just doesn&#039;t seem to go away these days. Sure, they&#039;re not as popular in the anime medium compared to the video game industry. Yet, some of them still lands a spot on television. One of them is called Battle Game in 5 Seconds.<br />
<br />
Now I could argue that the anime industry has been dominated by the isekai trope in recent years. But once in awhile, there&#039;s an anime about survival games. Battle Game in 5 Seconds was chosen to be adapted into a 12-episode anime series despite the manga having over 17 volumes and ongoing. Yes, it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418673">
        would for whatever reason, they wanted to showcase an anime about superpowers that draws the line between fiction and reality. And it all begins with protagonist Akira Shiroyanagi.<br />
<br />
Akira isn&#039;t your typical protagonist as he is protrayed as a prodigy. He&#039;s quick to learn on his feet and has a calm composure despite being thrown into a death game along with others. From the first episode, it became clear that Akira isn&#039;t a pushover or someone that can easily be intimidated. To add on to his character attributes, he&#039;s also got a clever mind and takes full advantage of his ability, the Sophist. With strategic thinking, it became obvious that Akira possesses intelligence beyond his age. When you have a character thrown into a survival game with all these traits, it makes Akira a key figure to watch out for, both for his allies and enemies.<br />
<br />
The rest of the character roster consists a wide range of backgrounds. Among the most prominent is Yuri Amagake, a 17 year old girl with a history of bad luck. And by adding her to show, it really brings in the question how much value she can contribute. To be honest, she&#039;s one of the most normal characters in the show with a rather abnormal ability (Wrath of God). It would appear the anime wants to show how a misfortunate girl can fight against bad luck and be who she is. However, the anime does a poor job at developing her character beyond the surface level. She&#039;s just too normal, with really nothing unique to describe about her. <br />
<br />
With those two out of the way, the rest of the character roster starts to stray from normalcy. For instance, the seductive Rin Kashii is introduced in one of the team battles that shows her manipulative nature. Shin, the quiet giant, is protrayed as an enemy of injustice. We also meet the delinquent Madoka who never lets anyone or anything gets in his way. But perhaps the most unusual among the cast is the catgirl, Mion. She plays the role of the administrator for the survival games. And believe me, she&#039;s about as cruel as a character can get in the show. Unfortunately, the anime doesn&#039;t adequately develop or reveal her true purpose. It&#039;s up to the viewers to decide on why she exists and what she truly wants to put all these characters into survival games with their lives on the line. Yes, that is the main drawback of the show. It seems the anime just drops everything to suddenly and expect us to be invested into the story.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the anime also appears to forgot or never really wanted to develop its character cast this season. Besides Aki and Yuri, most of the characters in the show are overshadowed by them. The overemphasis on Aki&#039;s goal as well as the survival theme itself tarnishes the legacy of this show. Given the survival game context, they should at least try to make one other character in the anime more memorable besides our two leading protagonists. Even for the two main leads, their character development is limited and for what&#039;s worth, very underwhelming. That it say, this show can easily be described by one word....underwhelming.<br />
<br />
Looking back, I never felt the show was visually appealing from the very start. There&#039;s obviously some violence and action given the themes of the series. However, nothing else really stood out whether it&#039;s the character designs, settings, or even the backgrounds. Somehow, they made a talking cat-like girl the most distinctive character in the series. While you could say the anime isn&#039;t about the art, it certainly deosn&#039;t enhance the overall viewing experience. Studios SynergySP and Vega Entertainment need to step it up.<br />
<br />
Battle Game in 5 Seconds took a hit for the team and I don&#039;t mean that as a compliment. It means it took a hit for itself by creating an underwhelming story with an equally underwhelming cast. With a manga running over 17 volumes, this served little more than an advertisement. It practically wants you to throw money at the franchise. Do yourself a favor and save your money. There&#039;s better investments you can make.

    The death game genre has reached a pit of mediocrity in modern anime standards. Most shows in this genre usually turns out to be god awful from the start, or has a decent beginning but crashes and burns in the end. So when I saw a new death game anime in this season, my immediate reaction was “Not another one” a saying DJ Khaled would be really offended by. But I’m honestly surprised to see this show hold up pretty well, enough to get me to watch the whole thing, start to finish…or it did at first. Does that mean it’s great? No, not really.<br />
<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418666">
        premise is pretty straight forward like most death games. Kill or be killed situations, surviving a platoon of super powered people and be the last man standing. It starts off with a giant, 8 foot crocodile ass looking man attacking our mc. Our mc manages to escape his assault and trap him in an abandoned building and manages to kill him. A bit unrealistic, as the more typical reaction would be to shit your pants when you’re attacked by a large menacing figure than to go full Tom Cruise mission impossible on the guy. He then proceeds to get transported by an overtly annoying cat girl with a top hat, and brought into the death game, where he’s given the full explanation of things. Sort off at least.<br />
<br />
The remainder of the story we see our mc in various fights and precarious situations. The premise is straightforward and not gunna lie kinda boring. The death battle genre is one that I rarely like, but even without personal dislike, it doesn’t have any uniqueness to it, or any factor that sets itself apart or grabs your attention. The powers and in this show feels unrealistic in the sense that there’s so much flexibility in them. There’s no borderline for how overtly unusual powers could be, and since we as viewers are in the dark about several rules of the game, it gets frustrating to see one dumb power coming out of nowhere. There’s no balance in that sense which leaves you confused and kinda annoyed.<br />
<br />
You feel a slight repetitiveness in the shows storytelling. It revolves around a problem being created, mc using his intelligence to solve the problem, everyone else losing their shit tryna figure out how he did it. There’s no opposing force, there’s no “L” to our mcs “Light”. This sets up a rly plain sailing plot with no added tension or suspense. You see a situation occur but you already know it’s going to get resolved with no added consequences. Although, I was dumb to expect proper storytelling in a death game so it’s honestly bad on my end<br />
<br />
The best part of the show is the mc. Most death games either have a mc who’s a complete whiny annoying character who’s scared shitless all the time, or someone who’s over confident, unusually strong and has will smith I am legend levels of smartness and survival tactics. The mc here is minimally intelligent and knows how to use his intelligence properly. He dosent have the whole “I can beat you, cause my friends are relying on me” bullshit. He knows a serious fight, plans ahead, and uses his brain to win rather than the friendship rocket launcher. His power compliments his intelligence a lot, which is one of my fav aspects of the show. Since it’s so vague what his power actually is, it gives him the liberty of experimenting and slowly figuring out the limits of his abilities, which is quite entertaining to watch.<br />
Other characters such as Ruri is a recurring presence in the show. She’s a girl with a troubled past, due to lack of parental affection, and she finds solace in caring for her little brother. She has a decent backstory but we don’t see that implemented into her character that much. She’s always cheery, active and loud. We rarely see her past effecting her personality. It would have been refreshing to see her all quiet and anti-social initially, but Akira helps her come out of her shell and makes her bright and cheery.<br />
We also have Walmart Bakugo, blue haired Joe Exotic, nerdy gamer girl, manipulating red head milf and a lot more. There’s an abundance of characters but all of them are super generic and extremely forgettable. They have their own parts to play but feel more like an NPC out of Skyrim than an actual character. The villain has the classic “Im the bad guy, I’ll kill everyone” look and leads the gang green gang of annoying misfits. The only character that’s remotely decent is the glasses guy that looks like he’s paid the subscription for every Onlyfans model in existence. His cunningness is somewhat amusing to watch in the last arc of the show. Besides that, forgettable, generic, annoying side characters.<br />
But we all know the best character is the banana head man<br />
<br />
The art in this show is not consistent. It starts off with a fairly vibrant art style, which was one of the things that made me curious about the show. But as more time passes, you notice CGI being used in most places. And if you’re wondering yes the CGI is horrible, almost comical. Im really wishy washy about CG in anime. When it’s well done, it’s actually pleasant to watch, like Beastars. When it’s awful, or combined with animation, it feels disgusting, like an unholy amalgamation of good and evil. It’s like oil and water, it just doesn’t mix. That’s the long term problem in this show, as even main characters start getting CG’d more often than animated. The fight scenes also has more CG than animation in the later parts, and most parts are covered with flashy lights, big explosions or smokescreens to avoid putting effort into their show. Like bruhhh, if a show that has “Battle” in the title dosent have its fight scenes properly animated, it begs the question “what is your budget going towards?” Characters also have their rough times, with disproportional facial animations that makes them look like something outta Resident Evil, and not even the good Resi games, like some shit outta Resi 6.<br />
<br />
Not going into details about the sound. OSTs are fine, OP &amp; ED was fine, and voice acting was generic yet well done. Although the cat girl was super annoying, like enough to make my ear drums bleed levels of annoying.<br />
<br />
Even with its amplitude of flaws, I honestly think it’s one of the better death games out there. It’s not a good show, but it out runs its predecessors in most factors which is something I can appreciate. It was more like a rocky ride than a constant downhill that I felt watching Darwins Game. The mc is the highlight of the show, and outshines most characters and was the only reason I came back to the show weekly. Fun show overall.

    This will be one of my first reviews so I&#039;ll be blunt and the reviews may contain spoilers. The anime tells how our protagonist Shiroyanagi Akira and other individuals find themselves in this classroom with a mysterious character who explains what happened after losing outside the room (this is a guess that he takes as &quot;proof&quot; what happened to the MC) and after killing a person and explaining the situation each player is taken to their respective rooms to reflect on what to do and to understand how their superpower works and also to test it. It all comes in a mysterious way and in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411406">
        that place killing is an option, the thing that intrigues me is the upcoming challenges and how the MC and other people will deal with them. I like the drawings and later MAYBE we could see the MC backstory. The anime does not stand out for its originality because a similar anime is released in 2019 entitled The Ones Within with almost the same mechanics but with cryptic characters. I recommend it for those who like anime in which the intellect is the winning factor and for those who like characters with superpowers.

    It Was Good Until It Wasn’t!<br />
<br />
[Prologue] <br />
<br />
Battle Game in 5 Seconds did not have a good start, neither did it have a great end. It did, however, have some great episodes in the middle. In a rollercoaster of a season 1, the show managed to grab attention for a fleeting moment and then swiftly moved away from what made it great. Let’s talk about how the show did in this review. <br />
<br />
[The Plot]<br />
<br />
The story in this anime is decent, although one might think it to be formulaic when it first begins. The crux of the story is founded upon a tried and true anime genre

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420155">
        of Death Game. The genre has a bunch of tropes that come with it, some of which Battle Game in 5 Seconds follows and others that it subverts. The element of the show that makes it stand out from its peers is its power system.<br />
<br />
This leads to many fun instances where he confuses the hell out of everyone he faces. The show also pays a lot of attention to establishing how his powers operate in the initial episodes. While the series doesn’t start very well, as soon as Akira’s powers start getting involved more and more, the show’s quality improves drastically in the next few episodes. From a below-average first episode, the series really starts soaring by the time the second round of the death game comes to an end. <br />
<br />
Then starts the third round of the game, with Akira and Yuuri, the show’s main female character, assisting Team Green’s efforts to thwart their rival faction, Team Red’s efforts to kill everyone they come across and establish their dominance. Here, the show tries to do more than the story can handle, and thus the effort turns out to be a half-baked one.<br />
<br />
While the Red vs Green arc was still an interesting one, the mind games that gave Akira his previous victories are cast aside now as he obtains a cheat code to gain whatever power he wants essentially. He uses this to wreak havoc upon the entire battlefield, and thus the show loses a lot of the stakes that it painstakingly set up in some earlier episodes. The show also commits the cardinal sin of killing off a character only to show them alive a few episodes later. Resurrection in a death game of all things is uncalled for.<br />
<br />
The battles between characters here are also very dull and predictable. The show tries to do a lot but ends up not delivering on any promises that it made. The resolution of the entire conflict is also all too convenient, and everything came to a head entirely too soon, killing the show’s pacing. Battle Game in 5 Seconds also breaks a few of the rules it established at the start, making you wonder if there was a point in watching any of this.<br />
<br />
Despite all this, the show has this delightful throwback mid-00s vibe to it which I talk about more here. The show, at times, felt like watching an anime when I was 14, which felt great. However, the show didn’t end well as the series lost all of its steam by its end and came to a screeching halt. I wouldn’t expect a Battle Game in 5 Seconds Season 2 to come along any time soon. <br />
<br />
[Characters]<br />
<br />
There are some real gems in the cast of Battle Game in 5 Seconds. The protagonist, Akira Shiroyonagi, is almost a psychopath in the ways he operates and thinks. He is a genius who will do almost everything to win without regard to how his actions affect others. He is a refreshing change from many other protagonists who are the epitome of good, as he still does good things but only when they benefit him. <br />
<br />
His direct counterpart is Yuuri Amagake, a kind-hearted girl who almost lost her life saving someone she didn’t care about. She acts as the perfect counterpart to Akira in every way, and her power is also one that complements her hardy nature. Battle Game in 5 Seconds tried to introduce some romantic tension between these two characters, but it didn’t do it effectively. They have good chemistry as friends, but it remains unclear if Akira is manipulating her due to his nature.<br />
<br />
Battle Game in 5 Seconds makes us root for our heroes by introducing some really effective villains at the beginning, and its instantly hatable villains make for one of this show’s best qualities. That is until it almost butchers the main bad guys of this season, Team Red bosses Ichi and Kuroiru, by giving them a manipulative back story and making them falter when they needed their power the most. The show does suffer from overpowered main character syndrome. <br />
<br />
The side cast is also very strong, featuring some solid and distinct personalities like Kirisaki, Kumagiri, Tatara, and Rin. The characters introduced in later arcs, including the Team Blue and Green leaders, are also fascinating, but we don’t see much of them. I despise Mion, however, as her voice wants me to pull my skin off every time she opens her mouth. Don’t stick around till the end of an episode if you don’t want your ears to bleed. <br />
<br />
[Art and Music]<br />
<br />
Battle Game in 5 Seconds really lacks in both of these departments. The art style works for the throwback effect that it is trying to pull in the earlier episodes, but things get out of hand as soon as any action happens on screen. The worst part of it is that the creators knew that they would have to animate battles before starting on the anime, as it is present in the show’s name. The show does not look very good.<br />
<br />
The worst offender comes to our screen in one of the later episodes, as the series uses 2D and 3D animation simultaneously in some parts, presumably to save money. The effects stand out a lot, disrupt your immersion from the show, and, speaking frankly, look absolutely horrendous. It would’ve been fine if showrunners only applied the 3D in a specific instance, but the series’ main antagonist is animated like that, and he looks like hot garbage. It’s a problem when you’re laughing at a character at what is supposed to be a pivotal emotional moment.<br />
<br />
The opening theme is unexpectedly delightful, containing many elements from the ’00s style anime again, which I found refreshing. All the rest of the music was unremarkable and already forgotten as soon as it left the year. Evidently, the show didn’t have the resources to do everything that it wanted to do. The series looked unwatchable by the last two episodes. <br />
<br />
[TL;DR]<br />
[Final Thoughts]<br />
<br />
Battle Game in 5 Seconds fails to impress despite an intriguing concept and a great run of episodes in the middle. The animation continuously let it down at every moment, and the show struggled to get going and come to an end. Oh well, we still have the manga, I guess.

    So, to keep it short, the dynamic of the show was: bad premise, quite good continuation, and gradually getting worse second half. Despite having one of the most stereotypical and bad premises out of there (and also character introductions), the following episodes got way better and actually interesting, only for the growth to be completely thrown out of a window later, with the story becoming stagnant, typical, and boring. The characters don&#039;t really help either, not even the interesting back stories being able to save the show. The fact that it loses its realistic factor, that made the characters feel human, only makes it completely

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418676">
        ruined. <br />
<br />
The story starts with an arrogant loner gamer boy that&#039;s extremely intelligent and thinks other people are not worth his time (that&#039;s definitely the first time we hear of this, right?) getting attacked on the street by a buff mummy that gets out of a car right in front of him and starts chasing him. Luckily, because he&#039;s smart and an ace at playing games (including startegy games), he manages to defeat him, and a quircky evil catgirl with a high picthed voice abducts him. Where does she take him? In a room full of people where she explains that they are part of a game now and were granted super powers. A set of games, to be precise, with more stages, that put their lives on the line. Pretty basic and used so many times before, isn&#039;t it? But here comes the good part: our (male) MC&#039;s super power. That&#039;s where it starts to get better.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the good part ends when we have to watch a single stage of the game go on for half of the episodes and it becomes all just a mind game that should have been impossible, actually. It has a little supsense, but not enough and it loses part of its meaning anyway, but I&#039;ll stop here for the sake of not giving that many spoilers. Point is, in my opinion the focus in the second half wasn&#039;t on what it should have been to make it a good show.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the characters. Aside the annoying male MC that I already described, (that gets a little more tolerable after a bit but still could have been a little more original), that has the typical appearance of a brown haired boy with brown eyes as well, we have the female MC that looks exactly like Rei (Highschool of the Dead) and has pretty much the same personality. Her backstory was pretty interesting and her character is tolerable, but her design kinda pisses me off tbh. There are also some interesting characters, and their backstories are pretty interesting most of the time (even for the more boring ones).<br />
<br />
To top it off, at the end the animation gets pretty bad on some parts (around episodes 11-12), especially when it comes to fighting scenes and one particular character, where the CCG is pretty obvious and doesn&#039;t fit well with the rest of the animation.<br />
<br />
The sound is okay, the sound track not exactly what I would listen to. However, I&#039;d say the ED went especially good with the anime.<br />
<br />
Well, that&#039;s pretty much all I had to say. Too bad it had to go like this, the anime had potential at some point.<br />

    This plot for this anime seems pretty generic, for now it reminds me of the tournament arc in Hunter x Hunter with some aspects of Deadman Wonderland. In this anime, each person is given a unique power and they have to undergo a series of challenges for an unspecified reason. I&#039;m very interested in seeing what the main character can do considering his interesting power, so I will be looking forward to each of the new episodes. <br />
<br />
Not sure how many episodes this can be, but from the looks of it, this is the type of show where either a lot will go wrong and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review412191">
        the plot will have too many holes in it, or the ending will be pretty interesting. Obviously I&#039;m hoping for the latter, but I don&#039;t have too high hopes for this show. In any case, I will be watching the full series and for now I have enjoyed it, so I will rate this show as 7 - Good for now. <br />
<br />
On a side note, this show seems to not be very popular, maybe due to the two animation studios working on it not being very popular or maybe the manga itself isn&#039;t very popular.  The art and sound are all done pretty well and I think in terms production quality alone this show is better than I would have thought coming into it.

    What makes a good battle royale show? Is it the story of where and how it all started? Is it the crew of characters that each and everyone of them have their wishes fulfilled? Or is it...a death game where if you die, you&#039;re dead forever both in-game and IRL (like in SAO)? For Deatte 5-byou de Battle a.k.a Battle Game in 5 seconds, truly in 5 seconds, you&#039;ll come to see that this show is just purely &quot;All according to Keikaku.&quot; the Animation in all of its average drabness across the entire anime&#039;s run.<br />
<br />
Death-perception game shows are nothing new in this day and age,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418667">
        the most recent example being of last year&#039;s Darwin&#039;s Game, and that by itself is a fast and frenetic death game that doesn&#039;t take its sweet ass time to develop the settings and such. It just infodumps you right in without any explanation, and does it only after the fact. Think of Hunter X Hunter in the early stages, but there are notable differences across the board once you can start putting two and two together. Deatte 5-byou does just that, but for some reason, executes it a whole lot worse with mangaka Saizou Harawata&#039;s writing that does start decently, until it goes straight into &quot;Battle Royale&quot; mode which is a blatant copy-and-paste tactic that fails to measure up to Darwin&#039;s Game in both the predictable story and the forced plot (I&#039;ll leave the animation part later on).<br />
<br />
The &quot;Light Yagami&quot; of this story is the MC Akira Shiroyanagi, the self-proclaimed smart gamer with an ailing health, and that&#039;s all he does: play games each and everyday without a care in the world. Just suddenly, a bandaged buff-lord man etches out of a vehicle, catching this 16-year-olf boy by total surprise and having to evade death in 5 seconds. Being someone who&#039;s totally out of league in this death battle in both power and physique, Akira just manages to escape at the slightest shave, but yet could not evade death by getting killed from this catgirl loli Mion. In comes this gaming experiment of a death game, and this protagonist (just like Darwin&#039;s Game&#039;s MC Kaname Suou) more than being forced and hauled into this, vows to destroy this organization for taking his (and others) lives hostage for their fun.<br />
<br />
You want to know how bad Deatte 5-byou de Battle can be? Here are the facts:<br />
Aside from coming in with the notion that I (and some of you) have watched Darwin&#039;s Game before, I just can&#039;t shake the fact that the characters are written TOO simple, more than just having 2 essential things: a goal/objective to get out of this death game, and a personality that lets us be sympathetic to their backstories, no matter how depressing they can be. For one, taking the protag Akira by example, he&#039;s just a stone cold-faced boy who tries to act and sound mature, but at times feel disconnected by his actions and words that are meant to be a play on his character. Being the big brain-er of a strategist, you would at least expect him to have some humanity, but nope, he&#039;s just a human with a robotized brain. At least the other main character who&#039;s standing toe-to-toe with him (Yuuri Amakage) exhibits the human trait, but I just can&#039;t help if the author decides to have a fetish that a boy-girl pairing is a must not only in close calls of trusted camaraderie, instead inciting the hints of romance as well (which there&#039;re some). The other characters are a complete joke.<br />
<br />
The superpowers (or abilities rather) given...are a complete Darwin&#039;s Game rip-off. Each and everyone has unique abilities that are only secret to their own unless they decide to tag team and share it across with allies, but even to the point of Akira&#039;s ability, none of them have the coolness factor of said series that are just subservience to service the plot. I mean, just to give you an idea, Akira&#039;s ability is the Sophist: &quot;Whatever your opponent thinks your power is.&quot; which definitely means that there&#039;re lots of possibilities to experiment with it. Sadly, it&#039;s as best as what you&#039;d think: for example if Akira can &lt;insert your guesses here&gt;, then he will exhibit that according to your POV. It only is a one-trick pony to play Survivor through a death game that requires battle wit, brawls and even brains just to keep your allies alive for your ultimate use. In the end, it&#039;s everyone for themselves.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s the abominable animation, which is the biggest sin of this show. Why in the world would you want to produce a modern-day show when it looks like it came from more than a decade ago? For context, putting this in comparison with the classic Initial D, the first season aged very badly, but subsequent seasons did have better production values that gave the series justice. Compare that to Deatte 5-byou, and I&#039;d reckon that it came out in the mid-2000s with old studios SynergySP (which did Initial D 5th and Final Stages that looked even worse than Studio Gallop&#039;s 1st Stage) and Vega Entertainment (which their last work was the IMO abominable 2005 OVA Boku wa Imouto ni Koi wo Suru). Studio A-CAT handles the CGI portion because these 2 studios didn&#039;t have the capacity to do that for a modern touch, and it&#039;s the same thus far I&#039;ve seen of badly produced works done. Putting all of that together, and &quot;OK boomer&quot; fans that had this show as their first taste of a battle royale...I&#039;d be like Steve Carrell playing The Office&#039;s Michael Scott to shout &quot;No God, Please No!&quot;.<br />
<br />
I have no sympathy for the music either, because while it fits the themes of this show, it quickly become white noise to me. For one, the OP which was VA Akari Kitou&#039;s like what, 2nd or 3rd solo, Tonikaku Kawaii&#039;s OP is a certified banger, but Deatte 5-byou&#039;s OP just instantly made me think that she CAN act, but she CANNOT sing solo. Thank god for other shows she has done before with others that mask her nice voice though. And also, I&#039;m not the biggest fan of Seiko Oomori, and this ear-blasting ED is a sentiment that only cuts deep to give my ears a good bleeding. Just so bad.<br />
<br />
Bring all of these facts with a production team that clearly does not have the experience or talent to back it up (and honestly, having series composer Touko Machida is a foresight that shows will fail under her supervision). With the pacing of the anime faster than the hare can outrun the tortoise, and Deatte 5-byou de Battle is a show that for the Average Joe who, in the words of a good friend: like battle-shounen that pretends to be deep, this might be what you are looking for. Other than that, there is hardly anything unique about this manga. Perhaps, I have been hoping to see something much better than that. So my advice to you is to start reading it, hoping to watch just an average anime. That way, you might enjoy it.<br />
<br />
As for me, the prelim reviews are a complete troll of a joke to say that y&#039;all clearly helped people to give Deatte 5-byou a try, but have only your opinions to back it up without years of experience, so why make reviews that are clickbait, algorithm-worthy when clearly the final product shown proves otherwise? (Alright, alright, I&#039;m kidding, but this show is NOT worth higher than a 7.) This show is just average overall, and now I have to go re-watch Darwin&#039;s Game again just to refresh my brains of this wack material. It&#039;s not pathetic to the point where some will like it, and you do you, but it just is a pain to watch this from start to finish.

    really liked this anime and enjoyed i was shocked when I saw its rating here I was hoping something of 8 but everyone have its opinion<br />
the idea of the anime is old but its only for 2 to 3 epis that u feel that way but after that, u really see the difference <br />
it was a continuous thriller u can expect anything to happen MC usually win but how he wins against strong opponents really matters for the anime and this anime exactly shows that <br />
MC has a very sharp and insightful personality but it doesn&#039;t look a bit overboard <br />
I highly recommend watching this

    Battle game in 5 seconds. In my opinion, this is a poorly done anime adaptation<br />
<br />
The anime cuts out too much of the content by trying to rush the story.<br />
<br />
The animation is very poor if you watch up to episodes 6-8 you can see animation changing and making the characters look weird.<br />
<br />
The anime makes characters seem lackluster. The story is good but I recommend reading the manga instead of watching the anime but if you are someone who does not read manga and likes the premise of this anime I recommend darwins game to watch and try to compare the two.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t want to be that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414986">
        kind of person who compares anime and manga but the thrill you get from reading the manga and the drive to read the next chapter is not in the anime I recommend you read the manga if you haven&#039;t.

    Hi everyone! And welcome to “Garbage of the Season [3]!” The series where I discuss the current season&#039;s trashy pile of unwatchable monstrosities so that mom can’t say I’m doing nothing with my life. But before I start, I’d suggest you smash that helpful button and click on notifications so that you won’t miss out on any of my upcoming reviews. So without further ado, roll the intro…<br />
<br />
*The Shaggs - Philosophy of the World starts playing*<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
*End of intro*<br />
<br />
Today’s garbage is the ever popular Deatte 5-byou de Battle. A show that doesn’t even have a grasp over its own title. Battles do in fact not happen

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418684">
        five seconds after meeting on the vast majority of occasions. So there goes the only thing that would make the show stand out, as everything else is just copied homework from others like it. <br />
<br />
Dea5 is presented as death game-esque, but is more in tone of a shounen tournament arc. For the focus is directed at fighting but not killing. Yes a few disposable side characters die here and there, but there’s no worry about the main ones. Because making the main characters overpowered in a death game scenario is the right way to build up suspense. And don’t get me started on how unbalanced the power system is. The main characters and villains obviously get the most useful superpowers since the plot armor wasn’t sturdy enough as is. <br />
<br />
The characters themselves are cardboard cutouts and you can pretty much understand them from one scene alone. The most you’ll get out of them is some tragic backstory that the writers seem to think equals a good character. There wasn’t a single person worthy of investment and I would’ve rather seen them die. That would’ve been interesting at least. <br />
<br />
I’ll just go on and write it: There are no redeeming qualities to be found in Dea5. The visuals are god awful, with the animation being especially abhorrent to look at. The music is poorly handled and the voice acting stiff and lifeless. Everything about this show and the hours wasted on it makes me depressed. So much in fact that I am going to put something sad in my outro.<br />
<br />
To summarize, I would describe this show the same way as my sex life. Something to cry at when you’ve run out of K-dramas. But you know something that hasn&#039;t run out? Me...GotS! And this has been Garbage of the Season! Leave your thoughts about Deatte 5-byou de Battle in the comments below and I’ll see you in the next review. Roll the outro...<br />
<br />
*A video showing us that Michael Bay is making a new movie starts playing*<br />

The End...

    WARNING: Contains mild spoilers<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10 <br />
<br />
The concept of this anime is really nice but it is not very well presented. I feel like the story is interesting and some of the fight scenes are quite enjoying to watch. The plot twists in Battle Game 5 Seconds is nice too. Even though the pacing might be a bit fast, they explained the plot well enough for me to give it an 8/10. <br />

Art: 4/10 <br />

5 episodes in the anime the art was pretty decent. The art style is definitely unique from other anime you can find out there. However, the CGI is trash. I feel like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417583">
        the CGI usage in this anime is trash. From episode 6-11 there is this arc where 3 teams would come to battle in order to advance to the next round. One of the leaders in the other team, THAT GUY, the animation on my boy is awful. Some of the fight scenes looks lazy and I feel like the animators could have did more work on him. <br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10 <br />
<br />
The soundtrack of this anime is actually not bad. The sound effects in the fight scenes are decent but overall the sound usage in this anime is not bad. The credit song (ED) slaps though, not gonna lie. <br />
<br />
Character: 9/10 <br />
<br />
I love the main character of this anime. Akira is a pretty intelligent character and I feel like he is very suitable for this show. I feel like Akira could have been a little more cunning and evil but I think his character now is good. The side characters are not bad too. Yuuri has a great synergy with Akira. I feel like the character depth for some of the other side characters can go deeper but I wouldn&#039;t complain about the characters right now. 9/10 <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10 <br />
<br />
This anime is decently enjoyable to watch. The CGI and the pacing ruined the enjoyment for me. Despite that, I actually love looking at some of the parts of the anime. I feel like anyone would enjoy it if they do not bother about the trash animation, sadly. <br />
<br />
Overall: 7/10 <br />
<br />
As of now this anime is pretty much well rated. I would recommend this anime to anyone who just wants to enjoy the characters and the concept of the anime.

    Here I am again, reviewing another anime of the season.<br />
Anime: Deatte 5-byou de Battle/Battle Game in 5 Seconds<br />
<br />
An anime with a not so good story, I believe it is for the mediocre, for the lowly. The way the premise is approached, I found it very uninteresting and the way it is done, makes me want to go to sleep and say &quot;I watched it, but I didn&#039;t understand it, lol&quot;, but also, depending on the point of view, the story is very superficial and makes you join a disinterest and watch it just for or for the protagonist having a relatively high middle ground and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415750">
        knowing how to do such a thing within the anime (I confess that I&#039;m only watching it because of mc, lmao).<br />
<br />
Ok, the animation in the beginning was ok. Nothing too &quot;wow&quot;, but the guys put me in a horrible CGI and poorly planned. I was very disappointed about this.<br />
<br />
The sounds are good, the voices don&#039;t make me want to scratch a blackboard and think this is better than listening to a character&#039;s voice (except for Mion&#039;s voice, which makes me want to scratch my throat or listen to a fax machine for an hour). The opening, in a way, is good, a strong point so far, and finally, the ost&#039;s didn&#039;t hold my attention, I found it very weak and sloppy.<br />
<br />
The characters are good, I confess I love the mc for being minimally intelligent and knowing how to use his intelligence, not a sloppy mc who is intelligent and doesn&#039;t act like it. The other characters are interesting, not so charming and not so mediocre. Each with their own life stories and goals. The characters are well introduced and from the beginning you already know a little about their personalities and goals (apparently, however, I may have made a mistake).<br />
<br />
Overall the anime is interesting and a great pastime (this is when the anime is finished being released), it&#039;s not bad and it&#039;s not very good, if it wasn&#039;t for the story and animation, I would give it an 8/10, but I stuck with 5/10. That&#039;s it, I hope you found this review useful.

    Negatives +<br />
After 5 episodes this anime has had some incredibly mediocre moments. Mostly a backstory which  has gore, sex, child abuse and other things. It&#039;s not that I don&#039;t like the backstory because of those things, but I&#039;m not amazed by the creativity or happy when those are the only things that were told so far, -1 point for me. <br />
The other thing that I still find lacking though I&#039;m only at episode 5 is the game element in the show. There&#039;s been quite a few very powers that aren&#039;t exactly new and the game where the characters wasn&#039;t explained at all, so when

          <span style="display: none;" id="review412215">
        I&#039;m thinking about how some parts of the anime feel like they weren&#039;t followed through, I&#039;m skeptical about what the future holds.<br />
<br />
Positives -<br />
So far it&#039;s been a lot of negative but there&#039;s also a lot of positive. Even if it&#039;s a game genre it&#039;s still interesting. I can feel how the story is building up little by little and there&#039;s also a lot of unique powers which keep it interesting and the game I assume they are playing is also progressing and there&#039;s always something happening. The games played in the game are also starting to get much more interesting at ep 5 where I&#039;m at right now. <br />
There&#039;s also some funny jokes that are sometimes missing in these game animes. Characters don&#039;t feel very out of the ordinary yet but they aren&#039;t bad or annoying and there are some that are actually quite unique and fun to see.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
That being said opening and ending are way above average and I like them both. It definitely feels like an upgrade of BTOOM!!! so far, so If you enjoyed that I would recommend this as well. Or anyone who&#039;s into game animes.

    I was surprised when this anime was first announced. I thought the survival game / battle royale genre has been left far behind in the early 2010s, since we are deep into the isekai era right now (for better or, probably, for worse). So while the key visual and PVs for this anime did not inspire much excitement, I was cautiously expecting an at least somewhat average palate cleanser with a hint of nostalgia. Well, that&#039;s pretty much what I got.<br />
<br />
I have not read the manga, so I will judge this purely based on the anime. This is pretty much the bog-standard death game anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review419191">
        you would see bouncing around the seasonal charts a decade ago (with art and animation quality to match). What makes this somewhat more intriguing is the mystery element - whereby the participants in the death game appear to be recruited as part of a broader conspiracy, instead of having straightforward goals and defined rules from the get-go. This mystery is used to a decent effect to drive tension in the early episodes but unfortunately fades over the course of the show&#039;s runtime in favor of more bombastic action setpieces and hastily written and poorly executed character backstories.<br />
<br />
Speaking of, I would highlight Akira, the MC, as the standout character in the series. Sure, he isn&#039;t anything too unique as far as death game MCs go (and at the very least he isn&#039;t a sigh-inducing weakling or idiot as these MCs tend to be). His aptitude for tactical and strategic thinking makes the &quot;big brain&quot; moments in the show&#039;s climaxes entertaining to watch. The way he uses his unique ability to gain an edge over the various enemies he encounters is a consistent highlight of the show. Unfortunately, the more mysterious elements of his own backstory receive no attention during this anime&#039;s runtime, but I am satisfied with what we got. The other characters are rather bland and uninteresting, and the villains are comically evil with uninspiring backstories. There are slivers of romance in this anime, especially in relation to the female lead, Yuuri, but it never takes away from the core narrative of the show (which I appreciate). Yuuri is plays a more important role as a critical part of Akira&#039;s plans, and her spunky personality forms a good complement to Akira&#039;s otherwise stoic persona. The focus is directed towards the action and Akira&#039;s thought process, from which where most of the show&#039;s core entertainment value is derived.<br />
<br />
There isn&#039;t too much to comment on from a technical standpoint. The art and animation aren&#039;t anything to write home about, with terrible CG used during demanding portions of certain action sequences. The music was mostly forgettable, though the OPs and EDs were catchy and fit the theme of the anime well (though I would probably forget them by the time next season rolls around).<br />
<br />
All in all, Deatte 5-byou de Battle was a bit of nostalgic fun, a throwback to the heyday of death games in the early 2010s, and a fresh change of pace from the isekai drab that muddies every season these days. You would get some enjoyment out of it if you prefer more &quot;brain&quot; than &quot;brawn&quot; in your survival games. If you are getting bored of the style of anime we are getting these days, this could be worth a casual watch if you can make room for it on a crowded seasonal watchlist. But if you really wanted a good survival game/battle royale anime to scratch that particular itch of yours, I would recommend checking out classic examples of the genre which have stood the test of time, and potentially some more interesting ones in upcoming seasons.

    Deatte 5-byou de Battle does nothing innovative with the death game genre. If you&#039;re into these types of shows, then you&#039;ll find it acceptable, and if you don&#039;t, then you&#039;ll think it&#039;s trash. <br />
I don&#039;t think Darwin&#039;s game is anything innovative or anything, but Deatte 5-byou de Battle doesn&#039;t even try with it&#039;s pilot episode. It&#039;s pretty clear that the author wanted to get the beginning out of the way so the death battles can begin. An extremely intelligent and convenient MC is shown in the very beginning, is which he&#039;s trying to &quot;immerse himself in a game to escape reality&quot; is coincidentally, given an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418692">
        opportunity to immerse himself in a game to escape his current reality. Wow! Usually, you&#039;re also given a sort of mystery as to why people got abducted and placed to fight each other in weird games, but this show just flat out tells you: &quot;we&#039;re testing new abilities, fight to the death!&quot; Again, it&#039;s a very vanilla beginning, and the most dull one I&#039;ve seen so far.<br />
I think that other than the beginning, the story arcs are alright. The fact that the MC has a pretty OP but interesting ability is cool, and you&#039;re driven to want to see how he gets past his obstacles in every stage. Of course, things just go too well for Akira for me to really root for him and care about the story, but it&#039;s good enough to pass the time. Again, the charm point of this story is how everyone has a unique ability, including Akira. Pair these with different battle settings and scenarios, and you got a fun little death battle survival story. <br />
What really gets me, though, is not even the boring beginning. I love the genre, and I was not expecting much anyway from the transition from regular life to death game. It&#039;s the animation. This show is on a hella small budget. Everything is so poorly animated. There are little to no backgrounds, the studio uses every trick to animate fights with as little budget as possible. In the very few frames where there are fights, they use crappy CGI instead of actual animation. It&#039;s a very low budget show clearly, and there&#039;s nothing good about it. I&#039;m not even too picky, but to have a show about fighting and using CGI or just poorly animated fights is just too much. Backgrounds are just solid colors half the time, closeups are constantly shown to avoid as much animation as possible, no details are shown, characters have unnatural limbs and bad proportions, etc. Pair this with the fun flashback montages that were already shown in order to save animating anything, you a really low quality show in the art department. Zoro&#039;s voice actor playing Kirisaki was a good surprise, but not nearly enough to salvage this show.<br />
Story wise, it&#039;s actually not bad, but the bad animation is just too much. I prefer anime over to manga, but I really suggest reading it instead...there&#039;s no salvation for this animation. I&#039;ll be doing the same

    This one was tough to rate. I feel like it has a great premise and story, but that it wasn&#039;t executed as well as it could have been. Having not read the light novel / manga, I won&#039;t know if this is just an adaptation issue.<br />
<br />
The battle royal and how it&#039;s executed are pretty great. You have straightforward villians and a protagonist who isn&#039;t afraid of getting his hands dirtty and both of those combined keep you engaged.<br />
<br />
The problem is just that sometimes the plot trips over itself trying to be clever and throw in twists. I feel like it&#039;s a bit too &quot;clever&quot; for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416557">
        it&#039;s own good. Where this gets the most frustrating is around the character&#039;s abilities. They seem extremely poorly designed and the author gives a lot of latitude to make the abiilites all seem to do whatever they want sometimes. It can be frustrating because as a viewer you don&#039;t know the rules so it just seems like stuff is just happening.<br />
<br />
Other than that though, it keeps me coming back for more if only because the MC is interesting and engaging. Definitely worth checking out and I hope it gets another season.

    I will start by saying this is not a bad anime. If you&#039;re looking for something to kill some time it&#039;s worth the watch. I wouldn&#039;t venture as far as saying that this is a must see however. My one main issue with the anime is that as the episodes progress the production quality drops. There was literally a scene where they animated the wrong person talking... But other than that it isn&#039;t bad. I definitely enjoyed myself while watching this, and plan to watch the new episodes as they drop. I like the character development that I am seeing so far as well.<br />

    Battle game in 5 seconds? more like I should&#039;ve dropped this in 5 seconds.<br />
Seriously, this show was absolutely mediocre in nearly every aspect. I don&#039;t really want to get into the nitty gritty of it, because most of the other reviews do a better job of it, so I&#039;ll just jot down some of the really irritating issues the show has.<br />
<br />
From the get-go every character is a boring cliched stereotype, for example, Akira, the MC, is cold and calculating, he&#039;s your ideal loner, edgy &quot;it&#039;s me against the world&quot; character (like we&#039;ve never seen that before). While he does have somewhat of a change of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418705">
        heart in the last episode, there really is no depth to the characters, especially side characters. The side characters are really just there to move the plot forward. I&#039;ll get to the plot in a second, but I just want to point out the cheap emotional tactics the show tries to pull on you towards Ichi and Kuroiwa, the two main antagonists towards the end. All of a sudden there are flashbacks and exposition on their &quot;tragic&quot; past that&#039;s meant to make us feel sad for these two scumbags, what a joke lol. <br />
<br />
Plot wise, the introduction has everything thrown in your face but other than that initial exposure, it doesn&#039;t develop any further. The main plot point of who Mion and her organisation are doesn&#039;t really go anywhere and instead, it ignores the initial plot for subplots, i.e., the introduction of the third stage and numerous other subplots. By introducing all these other subplots and characters you get further and further away from the actual storyline.<br />
<br />
One other issue I have with the show are the characters designs. The visuals are already mediocre, but even the characters&#039; appearances are stereotypes, you have the bad guys looking like well, your typical bad guys, and so on and so forth. There really wasn&#039;t much thought into adding any sort of artistic flair to the character designs, as a result, everyone looks plain and uninspired.<br />
<br />
CGI, especially towards the last episodes became downright hilarious. The CGI went all janky and stiff during fight scenes that I had to pause for a second just to calm myself down from laughing too much. <br />
<br />
Honestly, the premise of the show is interesting, especially Akira&#039;s power, but the way the show went about it ruined the whole experience. Really though, it&#039;s not a show to take seriously or waste any sort of brainpower on, instead, just watch it with your mind turned off and I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll have a blast.<br />
<br />
Also, Mion&#039;s voice is incredibly annoying, she sounds like a dying cat.<br />

    MILD SPOILERS AHEAD (Episode 2, 3)<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
From someone who very much enjoyed Darwin&#039;s Game, I have to say that the story also resonates with me. I find myself in these types of situations often, and I&#039;m glad they made a show to reflect that part of my experience. I think the story flowed naturally and had an interesting, unique chronological structure. If Quentin Tarantino directed an anime, this would have to be it. The story does have its shortcomings, especially with ability limitations. For example, how come Akira doesn&#039;t ask Yuri to summon a nuke for him? Or make him immortal, like Vegeta from DBZ?

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418174">
        Some things don&#039;t make sense, but you have to give Tarantino the suspension of disbelief.<br />
<br />
Art: 2<br />
The art sucks ass. I liked the part in the second half of the anime where the main villain (the big guy) was completely animated in CG. Even in scenes where everything else is 2D-animated, he&#039;s in CG. What&#039;s the lore behind that? How does that work? I found that it broke my immersion often. The 2D animation is also not very good, but Yuri looks cute and has nice boobs. So that&#039;s why it&#039;s a 2/10.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
The sound was actually not too good in the show, but it&#039;s passable. The voice actors delivered their lines exceptionally poorly, without any sense of realistic human emotion. It just didn&#039;t work. The soundtrack is also bizarre and will leave you disoriented. However, the ED is very good, and I must recommend you listen to it.<br />
<br />
Character: 4<br />
My favorite character was the pedophile guy who could smell the status of any girl&#039;s virginity (that was his special ability). But the writers killed him off in episode 2, leaving us with boring characters. Another excellent character that was wasted was a man with an incredible ability—to turn buttons into strings. He was also a big pervert. Unfortunately, he was brutally murdered for no real reason in episode 3. I think the writers are killing off all the interesting characters just to emotionally drain the audience, which works sometimes. But they didn&#039;t have to kill those two—they did nothing wrong and were lovable, innocent, pure-of-heart characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1<br />
I did not enjoy this show.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4<br />
Don&#039;t watch this show.
