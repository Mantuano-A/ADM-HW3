    [Spoiler Warning]<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not mad. I have only myself to blame for this, really. I tend to be more selective with what I watch. Something will be recommended, I&#039;ll hear about something popular, or it&#039;s just on my mind a lot. I&#039;ve never watched anything expecting it to be bad; usually I have no expectations at all, but often I at least think it&#039;ll be something that&#039;s enjoyable enough to pass the time and get a 5 or 6.<br />
<br />
The Asterisk War is my first exception.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t watch this because I knew it&#039;d be good. I watched it because I heard it was almost identical to Rakudai

          <span style="display: none;" id="review208259">
        Kishi no Cavalry, which I&#039;d just finished, and all I wanted to do was see which is worse. Yes, WORSE. Not better. I mean, that&#039;s not to say it couldn’t have been surprisingly good, but of course that couldn&#039;t happen. Of course, this review won’t be spent comparing the two anime together, but I will give a verdict as to which is better at the end. Because that’s what everyone asked me to do!<br />
<br />
Also, so the mods won’t be unhappy, I must inform you that I will spoil the first episode almost entirely, but spoilers will be toned down to a minor level beyond that episode.<br />
<br />
Asterisk starts off extremely rocky; honestly just about everything in the first episode is horrible, whether it&#039;s immediately evident or not. The opening scene is a fight with awkward choreography and absolutely no context at all, even as the scene comes to a close. It sets the tone, I guess, but the reason why this fight was shown at all just seems unclear after watching the whole season, as way too little is revealed in this opening, and its potential context doesn&#039;t have much weight on the following episodes. But I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll be explained later... in another season... that I won&#039;t watch...<br />
<br />
Some exposition is given, which is fine I guess, but one very interesting thing stuck with me. &quot;The people gradually began to alter their sense of morality.&quot; This is apparently due to some event called &quot;Invertia&quot;, and you really have to give the writer(s) props for making a new term for &quot;shitty writing&quot;. It&#039;s a shame they couldn&#039;t follow up on it, though. There might be some stupid actions, but nothing horrible enough to make you really think that these people are really fucked in the head; these things instead feel forced so that the &quot;story&quot; (read: too little) and fanservice (read: too much) can keep going.<br />
<br />
The first example of characters being idiots instead of morally questionable comes quickly. Icky--oh, sorry, wrong review—Ayato (the main character) catches a falling handkerchief, sees and open window (and/or hears someone&#039;s voice from it), and sums up the obvious. He jumps into the window to return the handkerchief, only to see a female student only partially dressed. Here&#039;s everything wrong with this scene:<br />
<br />
1. He acts apologetic, knowing that it was an accident, despite not considering that he would&#039;ve been obviously invading someone&#039;s privacy by jumping through their FUCKING WINDOW, MULTIPLE STORIES HIGH. If some awareness to the obviously horrible idea were present, even if it results in the MC being a massive douchenozzle, it could at least be pinned to people having fucked up morals. Nope, instead he tries playing this off like it’s not just a prank, bro.<br />
<br />
2. We get a glimpse of someone’s ass before knowing whose ass it even is. But don’t worry, it’s not that important, this is only the female fucking lead. Where are the Japanese tumblrvists when you need them? If the fanservice wasn’t so forced, this could’ve been an OK scene, but god forbid someone has to go three minutes without popping a boner over their new waifu. By the way, you can stop taking the show seriously at this point.<br />
<br />
3. If your handkerchief is so important, why did you carelessly leave it sitting loosely near an open window? How the hell did the wind even suck a cloth out of a room, anyway? Why was Ayato surprised by seeing a girl in the room when he heard her talking? If he didn’t hear her talking, why did WE hear her talking?<br />
<br />
This goes into a very laughable fight scene that only exists because Julis’s personality makes absolutely no sense, if she even has one. She thinks Ayato should die or something because he saw her naked (apparently wearing underwear = naked, k), despite being soooo grateful for getting a super-special piece of linen back. Maybe this could be some inverted moral bullshit like the story wants me to believe, but you’ll later see how much of a clusterfuck this character is as the show goes on. The fight itself is full of weird technology and magic we know nothing about, plot armor, and overall poor direction. (Why did Ayato jump through an explosion unharmed? And why did the soundtrack suddenly stop just when a character is thinking, only to go to some mysterious-sounding tune? It’s weird.) It ends with Ayato glomping Julis to avoid some assassination or something, and he later gropes her somehow because fanservice, or awkward comedy, or… I don’t know. Oh, did I say something about an assassination? Who cares? No one else does, so that’s obviously not important. Let’s move on.<br />
<br />
I could pick apart every scene, but I’d just retrace the same points and conclusions the above have made, more or less: Characters are incredibly stupid, whether the writer made them do stupid things or the writer leaked his stupidity into the plot’s scenarios at various points, and not because of some global event. The art is pretty generic and obviously tries to compensate by being flashy, the music is mostly uninspiring, and just the overall direction seems to be mediocre. All of this is taken from the first ten minutes of the first episode. That’s all.<br />
<br />
In short, the show quickly establishes how fuckin’ bad it is.<br />
<br />
So, I’ve been mentioning this “Invertia” thing a few times. It IS pretty important, and you should really pay attention to that scene, because it’s the only time in the whole show that you’ll hear about it! …Wait… oh. Yeah, Invertia is mentioned once, or something. No one talks about it, and there’s no noticeable impact from it (as far as morals go). Why did they bother mentioning this part of it? And you know that fight in the beginning? That kinda hints at some other “major” plot element that gets totally forgotten about after it’s brought up. The first episode is basically spent teaching you things you will never need to know. It’s high school algebra all over again!<br />
<br />
Beyond this façade of a setup, there’s some sort of plot, or at least there should be. Basically, Ayato comes to this school to kinda learn about his sister and mostly to find some path for himself, so he starts training for these fighting events, and wow I am REALLY bored right now. Along the way, he meets various girls who do all but tear out their reproductive organs and install them into exuberantly-colored fleshlights for his personal satisfaction. It’s honestly hilarious how frequent the fanservice is, and how few reasons the girls have to each fall in love with the MC. Asterisk’s girls come in different shapes so that everyone’s tastes are satisfied, and they’re exploited so commonly that I wonder if Asterisk is trying to trying to appeal to the hentai artists or if the creators are bragging that they have girls in their series. I’m sure you’re all very satisfied with yourselves.<br />
<br />
If you need to be reminded again that the characters are bad, this is your lucky day! The characters are bad! So here’s my favorite part, the character roast section:<br />
<br />
Ayato – Things worth saying/making fun of are as follows:<br />
<br />
Julis – Independent black woman who don’t need no bodyguard. If you ignore the fact that she’s a figure of royalty, a high-ranking student, and that your IQ is lower than that of an earthworm, then it makes a lot of sense.<br />
<br />
Claudia – You know what? This is the best character in the whole show, and all who disagree can fucking fight me. She’s the most direct with her affection for Ayato to the point where she flat-out says she wants to fuck. At least there’s no bullshit about it, other than her having no reason to like Ayato and Ayato being a scrubmaster about it. (Do I need to bring up Cavalry again? WHAT SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD KID IS GOING TO BE EMBARRASSED BY THIS? DON’T LET YOUR DREAMS BE DREAMS, ASSHOLE.) Also, please note that her ending scenes to preview the next episode literally do not exist. Nope.<br />
<br />
Saya – Hi, I’m a deadpan loli with no real reason for being in this show other than to be the loli in this harem. If the point of her personality was to match the audience’s evident opinion of her, they nailed it on the fucking head. <br />
<br />
Kirin – Kinda younger-looking girl with big tits. Apparently her dad’s in jail, so she and her big tits need to win these festival things or something, and follow the guidance of her uncle who’s abusive as hell for no reason. So, I guess at least this character and her big tits have some sort of conflict??? And then we can waste a couple episodes on her and her big tits?????? No need to thank A-1, I’m sure they do it because they care. And for the record, the anime tells you at every waking moment that this character has big tits because we can’t shove Claudia into every scene.<br />
<br />
Lester – I’M A DOUCHEBAG WITH MUSCLES. DISLIKE ME!<br />
<br />
Irene – Wincest.<br />
<br />
Did I miss anyone? Probably. Do I care? Probably not. <br />
Did I have too much fun with that? Probably. Do I care? Probably not.<br />
<br />
Kinda going into my next point, what the fuck is with everyone’s hair in this thing? What sort of insane products are these people using that allow their hair to suspend in midair? Like holy hell, does their lack of personality somehow expel a gravitational field from their heads? It’s insane, dude. They also have that wonderful, classic “spot the major character” look; if their hair is the color of something not really found in nature, they’re important. If not, they might exist, but you won’t remember them. Everyone below this line is some overly-generic CG filler person or something. <br />
<br />
Overall, the art might be dazzling to some, but I only see A-1 trying to compensate for their overall weak animation, and no amount of ass shots will redeem it. Even if you don’t agree that the first episode is bad, you can’t possibly tell me that, say, episode 4 looks good. Beyond the animation, the CG is the compensation part, as I couldn’t ever get behind the flashiness and vibrancy of the magic and weapons. I mean, they’re not bad… but they’re certainly nothing special, especially since fights are so reliant on them.<br />
<br />
By the way, there’s a lot of this CG technology that’s omnipresent even outside of the fights, so it’s not just a bunch of magic and glowing plastic weapons making lightsaber noises. This might’ve been better to bring up in the setting/plot parts of this review, but whatever. Anyway, what the hell is all of this shit? All this technology and shit is literally omnipresent; everywhere you go, you see holograms of various functions. Where do these things even come from? How do they work? What can you do with this amazing technology besides open doors from across a room and use them as replacements for what we know as computers? Why am I asking questions that I know will NEVER be answered? <br />
<br />
Last thing about the art; who the FUCK is responsible for the next episode previews? You know, that shit at the very end of each episode where Claudia looks like she’s in some visual novel but is animated like a 5-year-old edited it? Jesus Christ, I don’t think I’ve ever cringed so hard after watching something in an anime. I only watched one of these before deciding that I’d never do it again, so please watch at your own risk.<br />
<br />
Now, the soundtrack is… actually good. Some of it. I believe just one person (Rasmus Faber) did the entire score (my apologies if this is incorrect), and if that’s the case, his electronic pieces are easily his strong point. (Which makes sense; I hear he’s a DJ or something.) The OP and ED are pretty good as well. But unfortunately, the rest is mediocre at best. The more orchestral pieces don’t quite stand out or are as memorable as the electronic pieces, but I don’t want to seem more negative than positive in this section. I’ll actually admit something was good in this anime.<br />
<br />
But all those negatives aside, at least it wasn’t as bad as Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry.<br />
<br />
…Or was it?<br />
<br />
You know, it’s hard to decide on which is worse. I couldn’t take either anime seriously, but Cavalry still made some attempt at being serious at one point. At least there’s some sort of reason for the shit that’s happening. Asterisk has nothing going on at all! But even if Asterisk did nothing, playing it safe worked to its advantage, because Cavalry’s serious moments are heavily weighed down by the sheer awful, cringe-inducing scenes that infest it. I mean, Asterisk is bad, but it never made me uncomfortable. But Cavalry still did a couple things right, such as the art (mostly) and the romance (to a small extent). Asterisk has a few good songs, and that’s about it. So my overall verdict as to which is worse…<br />
<br />
Surprising myself a bit, I’m giving that honor to The Asterisk War, mainly based on the fact that it did fuck all to help itself, while Cavalry at least made some legitimate attempt somewhere. And with that settled, I can walk away from this anime with a strange sense of satisfaction: that I was looking for a good match between two terrible anime, and I walked away with an unexpected, but satisfying result. Great job, Asterisk, you actually succeeded in something, by being the Worst One!<br />
<br />
And that’s all. Full score is below, thanks for… oh god… I just realized something. Invertia didn’t change the morals of the characters, it changed the morals of the writers! And the producers! And whoever the hell else is responsible for this! Oh man, I think it’s gotten to me as well! I went out of my way to watch a bad anime and I was just thankful for it being so terrible! Holy hell, this show is actually genius!<br />
<br />

<br />
Congratulations are in order, for this is my very first 1/10 score. It was originally a 2/10, but after considering things more for this review, I can’t think of any reason to give this anything higher. What did I like? The art was okay but pretty boring, and the soundtrack was pretty nice, but they’re beside me for the most part. If they were actually great and really memorable, like, say, Guilty Crown, then that’d probably let me raise it to a 2 or a 3. But even if GC is a pile of shit beyond the production, at least it made an honest attempt at writing a story and had some legitimately interesting moments. Asterisk has NOTHING that is interesting, whether it’s due to a lack of explanations or just sheer unoriginality. I mean… well, I already wrote the review, so I won’t go back. I guess all that needs to be said is that this anime is pretty ass.<br />

    Gakusen Toshi Asterisk is a series which starts off as one of the most uninspiring anime I&#039;ve ever seen throughout its first few episodes, but past a certain point it starts improving quite rapidly. Granted that doesn&#039;t really say very much given how mediocre the opening is, but despite the lackluster start it manages to make a quite impressive comeback and eventually become a pretty enjoyable anime.<br />
<br />
First things first though, episodes 1-4 of Asterisk didn&#039;t exactly give me a very good first impression because they are *painfully* generic. Like if you&#039;ve seen any typical action/fantasy/ecchi/harem magic academy anime before, you should know roughly what clichés

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205958">
        to expect, and I&#039;ll just say that initially Asterisk has effectively all of them. Our protagonist Ayato transfers into a new school and walks in on the tsundere female lead Julis in her underwear within 3 minutes of the first episode and &#039;accidentally&#039; grabs her breasts, he meets his new classmates and immediately becomes surrounded by a bunch of girls who fall in love with him for whatever reason, he&#039;s given a powerful magic sword which he just so happened to be the &#039;chosen one&#039; to wield and thus becomes super overpowered... you get the idea. Basically it&#039;s all been done countless times before and I&#039;m really getting sick of it at this point. As a side note there&#039;s also this one scene which blatantly rips off the light sabers from Star Wars for some reason, even the sound effects were completely the same... well whatever.<br />
<br />
Anyway, then starting from episode 5 (what I presume is the beginning of the second volume of the light novel), something happens to this anime which slowly but surely turns it into something different. And it comes with the introduction of a girl named Kirin; a very shy and nervous girl, yet also the top-ranked student in the school in terms of fighting prowess. The story starts putting a surprising amount of focus on her character and backstory, and in the process it downright sneakily goes *away* from the abundance of overused clichés it had in the first few episodes. Suddenly the amount of fanservice and romcom shenanigans is severely toned down, and instead we actually get some real depth and character development. Sure, it only really involves Kirin herself and our protagonist Ayato, but it was still a breath of fresh air compared to just having content I&#039;ve already seen a hundred times before in other anime. And plot progression aside, I personally found Kirin to be by far and wide the most likeable girl in Asterisk&#039;s character cast anyway so I guess it was a win-win scenario in that sense.<br />
<br />
Now I haven&#039;t read the light novels of Asterisk, but based on the contents of the anime I&#039;m presuming it&#039;s covering every volume in 4 episodes each. And thus I was a bit worried that it&#039;d start to get worse again after the anime had finished up on the contents of volume 2 which seemed to be the Kirin-focused one. Fortunately however that didn&#039;t turn out to be the case, as starting with episode 9 we finally get into what I guess can be called the &#039;main&#039; story of this series. Introducing the Festa: a grand series of tournaments where the students of the six different magic academies in the city of Asterisk fight each other to showcase their talent and technological development. The price they&#039;re all fighting for is the opportunity to have any one wish of theirs granted. Naturally, Ayato and the girls are competing as well. Normally I&#039;m not a fan of action in ecchi anime since it tends to end up rather incompatible with its own fanservice, but Asterisk does a respectable job at keeping the two sides separate from one another. As a result, the duels in the Festa are actually not that bad, and A-1 Pictures&#039; are not exactly newbies when it comes to creating fancy special effects in shounen battles, so the visuals are pretty decent too.<br />
<br />
When Gakusen Toshi Asterisk started airing, I considered it one of my least favorite shows of the season. Not that it&#039;s finished however; I&#039;d say it&#039;s a perfectly acceptable show. Not anything amazing by any means of course, but if you just want an easily enjoyable way to spend 20 minutes every weekend... then this anime pulls it off very well. Discounting the generic and unimpressive opening, it has pretty decent fight scenes and production value, as well as good characterization for at least part of its cast. Oh and for you pervs out there who are just intending to watch this for the ecchi tag, I&#039;d recommend you to look somewhere else; Asterisk really doesn&#039;t have very much of that at all.<br />
<br />
I cannot make a proper evaluation of the story as a whole though for the simple reason that... well this is a split-cour. At the time of writing this we&#039;ve still only gotten to see half of what the anime has to offer, with the second season airing in Spring 2016. However the Festa is a huge event, and there&#039;s plenty of action left to showcase on that front, so the second cour might very well be even better than the first. Fingers crossed.

    Towards the end of 2015, two light novel adaptations became notable for sharing startling similarities between them. Chivalry of a Failed Knight was considered somewhat refreshing, occasionally playing around with awful tropes and channeling the power of competent screenplays and exciting directing to turn a school battle LN adaptation into something worth watching. Conversely, The Asterisk War failed to meet even the basic requirements to function as a generic work of fiction. It&#039;s barely worth the effort it takes to write about it, let alone animate it.<br />
<br />
Before we start, I dare one of you to make a thread or a blog showcasing the exact amount

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301738">
        of problems each episode has. Don&#039;t make a drinking game out of it, or you&#039;ll die of alcohol poisoning by episode 8. The show literally starts with the main puss ass lead walking into our Tsundere in the middle of undress, under the pretenses that she dropped something important to her. After she claims to owe him one, she tries to incinerate him out of nowhere, resenting him for the rest of the episode in the process. This sets a precedent as to how badly this show will execute and contradict everything, like being low enough to over-sexualize a 13-year-old who regularly gets slapped by her uncle and saved by Ayato, whilst simultaneously acting like her asking for a sparring match the main character she fought of her own volition before is in any way indicator of her strength as a person. Just to provide the illusion that broke as hell Ayato isn&#039;t obscenely powerful, they provide flimsy limiters that only work when he uses a specific weapon for too long, despite that he often goes past the time limit of the limiters with no problem until the match finishes. The show breaks its rules so often that its ravaged narrative arcs become that much worse. Even the interesting ideas this dreck presents aren&#039;t capitalized, let alone worth capitalizing on in the first place.<br />
<br />
The world-building is easily the most fractured part of this dumpster fire. The tournament arc has been hinted to be a tournament in which things can get deadly and bloody for competitors, but no one gets remotely injured or killed, aside from that one pointless and awkwardly done flashback scene at the very beginning., if students can summon hovering screens with their hands for no reason, then why do they need to hold them, and why is there actual paper involved? The world-building of this show is some of the worst I&#039;ve ever seen, as if the narrative wasn&#039;t already cheap enough with its trite nonsense, missed opportunities, and romantic mood killers designed to preserve a terrible harem.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, Ayato is as horribly characterized and intolerable as his harem, which is one of the worst in the mainstream anime hemisphere. Julis is a trash tier Tsundere who plays up that trope to obnoxious degrees, especially when she retardedly blows up her room in an attempt to scorch him alive for the crime of accidentally seeing her in her underwear. Saya is an obnoxiously possessive loli with all the intolerable tropes you&#039;d expect. Kirin is an annoyingly squeaky pushover with a ridiculously lousy character arc As for Claudia, anything she has going for her can be boiled down to sass, sex appeal, and an insidious and mysterious nature that I guarantee this show won&#039;t capitalize on. The other characters are either stupid or wasted, with almost no middle ground beyond just being &quot;there&quot;. Easily the most crushing case of the latter is Irene, who is a dangerous punk with a heart of gold and an interesting design. They go out of their way to do nothing interesting with her when it&#039;s time for her to fight our unbearable main lead in the finale, and the closest we ever get is how her younger sister keeps her in check, which has also been done a million times. When a character like her is the best character in the show, it speaks volumes of just how worthless this cast is.<br />
<br />
Visually speaking, this show isn&#039;t much better. The colors are certainly bright, and some of the character designs can actually be pretty neat and sexy but the artwork is pretty miserable. It&#039;s a low-budget SAO and Aldnoah.Zero style with even shittier and more incomprehensible choreography, and even more all-encompassing fugly CGI. Much like the show itself, the visuals are bad at even pulling off being generic and mediocre, barring a few relatively dazzling environments. Even the aesthetics are gaudy and nonsensical, and the cuts of actually good animation are few and far between. At least Andloah.Zero had some flourish to make up for generic style and cheap CGI.<br />
<br />
The OST is a mixed bag of vanilla background noise, awful dubstep, and ill-fitting emotional pieces. Even the OP is a milquetoast pop song, in spite of it being catchy. The ED titled &quot;Waiting for the rain&quot; by Maaya Sakamoto and Ramsus Faber is the only stellar bit of music in the show, as it&#039;s a pretty stellar emotional track to close out each episode with. Even the visuals are interesting, with the show swapping the positions of a bunch of color-coded silhouettes of each harem member, which are accompanied by some actually pleasant techno melodies and Maaya Sakamoto&#039;s warm, even uplifting voice. Still, if having one good track is all the audio needs to be unquestionably better than every other aspect of this show combined, then I really can&#039;t find a better way to call this show dogshit.<br />
<br />
People put themselves through hell slaving away at this, and no one did a remotely good job beyond the musicians. That&#039;s as sad as the show itself. This anime isn&#039;t even infuriating or laughable, just annoying and lifeless, which is one of the purest tells that this has no value I can assign to it, let alone any reason to be watched enough to garner a second season. It even fails to live up to its title in any way, shape or form. How this got popular is beyond me, and I&#039;m glad it&#039;s dead.

    It&#039;s totally okay to watch a show with low expectations. Sometimes to balance a great anime, you gotta watch a bad one just to put you back in your place. It&#039;s a requirement to have watched poorly done shows so you know where your tastes are and also broaden your horizons. The Asterisk War serves as one of those shows that will give you appreciation of shows like High School of The Dead and other shows that have poorly written stories and brick wall characters. This is a must watch if you need to remember that there are really uninspiring anime.<br />
<br />
Storywise, not much to say.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review208515">
        Gary Stu comes to new school, all the ladies fall for him the end. Sounds like the typical harem anime because it IS a typical harem anime. The whole thing is a tease and shows snippets that relate to the protagonist indirectly, but fails to establish a basis for it. What I mean if that sounded pretentious, is the lack of an overarching conflict. We follow young Ayato, but for what? All we see is him turning red at every little female physical contact. <br />
Deus Ex Machina phenomena is arguably always going to break a show. I think it works in this show&#039;s favor just because there weren&#039;t really any upsides to begin with. It gives a little more excitement in what was a lackluster show. Arguably it isn&#039;t phenomena but foreshadowed. Ayato&#039;s power makes zero sense considering the circumstances revolved around him and that the whole show seemed to have miss the point was just bad writing on many levels. But hey, what more to look forward to in a show then a guy&#039;s head in between breasts? <br />
<br />
The chemistry between the characters is awful and blame the story telling for that. None of the characters mesh well and there isn&#039;t any positive to get out of observing their actions and motives. They all suck. If gary stu didn&#039;t fit the description of the main protagonist, then I don&#039;t know what to believe. This guy is the most uninteresting (for lack of a better word) fuckboy. Something that works against the show is that it was really trying to take Ayato&#039;s circumstances seriously. The tropes are quite abundant and make all the female characters seem like cut outs of cariactures placed in an anime. And to munch the very uninteresting main protagonist at that. The Asterisk War really is a tease when it comes to scenes of sexualizing the females. Cuz boobs and butts sell right? I&#039;m losing brain cells trying to think of anything to write for this show.<br />
<br />
VOICE ACTING IS VERY BAD. My ear was bleeding due too Saya and Kirin&#039;s voices oh my goodness. It is awful and to hear baby squeals and &quot;jealous&quot; grumbles is reason enough to AVOID this show. I say it&#039;s a must watch because this might set the bar low enough for anything to come after seem like a masterpiece. We&#039;re all masochists when it comes to anime though so it&#039;s okay. Sound is underwhelming but the EDM is a good twist in action scenes.<br />
As for animation, it is the Irregular of magic high school esque. Flashy colors and CG stuff. Considering how little action there is, animation isn&#039;t really great. Lot more exposition than there is fighting and we know how that works out in a harem. <br />
<br />
I came into this show knowing it was going to be bad so I didn&#039;t really think of it as anything I haven&#039;t seen before. It brings nothing new to the table, nothing inspiring, no noteworthy scenes. It&#039;s just a letdown in all aspects besides I guess teasing if that has any credibility. I&#039;d surf the internet if I wanted to be uninspired but I guess the one thing the show has going for it is it&#039;s opening. Its pretty cool, not that cool but its okay. A typical harem that lacks a resolution is what can best describe The Asterisk War.

    Warning, this review might have some spoilers! <br />
<br />
It is a great story after all, but something is missing in it. This anime was really great and i can say that there was some missings in the episode that might just would fit in there, but its not much to complain about that. I really did love that he was powerful (i guess not spoil). It does reminds me of SAO (Sword Art Online). Swords there and swords here. There is season 2 now and i expect that he (spoil) will get away that thing that holds him back from using hes true 100% power in

    One of the most generic and boring LN Harem adaptations I have ever seen.<br />
<br />
Set in a vague, unexplained, and ultimatly uninteresting world filled with shallow, cliched characters, who lack even the most basic of decision making or logical ability.<br />
<br />
The Main cast includes <br />
<br />
1. Generic blank slate harem MC<br />
<br />
2. Generic fiery Tsundere.<br />
<br />
3. Childhood friend cliche &amp; deadpan loli, wants MCs D.<br />
<br />
4. Exposition character who I can not remember a single character trait of except that she wants the MC&#039;s D.<br />
<br />
5. another loli introduced later<br />
<br />
There is virtually no character development, the plot goes nowhere, MC is as generic as it gets.<br />
<br />
There is no reason to watch this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213450">
        show, if you have seen any other generic Harem you have seen this.

    Dual Cour Format: An anime meant to be 24 episodes as fitting of Trimmed Format but because of limited TV Slot booking often airs at different points in time. Often announced simultaneously for example:<br />
<br />
Shinmai Maou no Testament, Gate<br />
<br />
Story 8 / 10<br />
<br />
The story begins with Amagiri Ayato a transfer student to the Seidoukan Academy and progresses as ground work for what&#039;s to come for the future of a student that does not care about the combat called festas that surely but slowly is getting himself riddled on something darker. <br />
<br />
Since this is a dual cour series I won&#039;t go into detail until I&#039;ve seen 2nd cour

          <span style="display: none;" id="review217025">
        but it&#039;s well executed giving the serious moments their bubbles and good portrayal of character bonding on an Academy where everyone it&#039;s everyone enemy.<br />
<br />
Art + Animation 8.5 / 10<br />
<br />
Gakusen Toshi Asterisk has great animation and above average art that combined are way more than decent. It&#039;s objectively good with no problems.<br />
<br />
Sound 8 / 10<br />
<br />
I caught myself singing the OP of this series and goes without saying that the choice of BGM and OST are very good. The voice actors are very good as well and the ED does not disappoint.<br />
<br />
Characters 8 / 10<br />
<br />
On the first cour the character are very well developed and their dynamics are quite entertaining. The chemistry of the female lead Julis-Alexia is reminiscing of normally black haired heroines that are usually portrayed as very confident and proud (Kanzaki Kaori from A Certain Magical Index). <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 8 / 10<br />
<br />
I thoroughly enjoyed this first cour and I&#039;m looking forward to the second cour. Mostly from the choice of visuals that seem to be a mixture from (Strike the Blood and A Certain Magical Index).<br />
<br />
Overall 8 / 10<br />
<br />
I recommend this to someone who doesn&#039;t get bothered by extended groundwork and light hearted comedy, romance with the bonus of spectacular short battle sequences. <br />
<br />
Do not watch if you&#039;re illiterate (Using the Term loosely) and couldn&#039;t or don&#039;t know airing formats nor like Harem oriented anime.

    I&#039;ll start of by saying that this was one of my first anime ever which is why I have somewhat of a soft spot for it, although i didn&#039;t finish it until a year later haha.<br />
<br />
Story 6/10<br />
The story is alright nothing special really, just a basic school with powers or magic. <br />
<br />
Art 7/10<br />
The art is good but nothing special, I really like the effects of the blades and all but for the rest its nothing I havent seen before<br />
<br />
Sound 10/10<br />
This is the first anime I watched the full credits for on every episode (now a days I do it for most anime but back then

          <span style="display: none;" id="review371304">
        I always skipped it) and it&#039;s because I loooove the song it&#039;s so beautiful and stuck in my head.<br />
<br />
Characters 6/10<br />
I&#039;ll admit I like most of the female characters but I always sigh because everything is so typical it really gets on my nerves.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9/10<br />
Okay I&#039;ll admit this anime is not super good but since its one of the first anime I ever watched I get a special feeling when I see the characters or hear the OP &amp; ED, I guess you could say its a guilty pleasure.<br />
<br />
Overall 8/10<br />
Look I like this because I&#039;m very biased but I actually don&#039;t recommend this anime unless if you want a anime centered around waifu material.

    This anime is definitely an interesting one when it comes to my overall enjoyment and whether I think its a quality title so far or not. <br />
<br />
Story: 6 - The story is fairly intresting and each episodes make me want to watch the next episode so i&#039;d say it has a good story development. Of all the animes watched I can think of three animes namely Absolute Duo,Freezing and Infinite Stratos which has a similiar story and development. And this season (Fall 2015) an another similiar anime &#039;Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry&#039; have been airing as well. Although both of them are good and intresting it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review217015">
        makes me wonder if if the money could have been used for a more creative and unique project.<br />
<br />
Art: 8 - The art is great. Contains a lot of great scenery and special effects were good , not to mention battle art is cool as well. <br />
<br />
Sound: 8 - Opening song is phenomenal, sound track fits well and sounds good. Not much else to say at this point.<br />
<br />
Character: 5 - Characters are pretty basic and its nothing new. I have seen same type of character many times. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7 - I am without a doubt enjoying the anime, I look forward to the day each episode is released for the fun 22 minutes of each episode.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7 - It is a good anime without a DOUBT and have a lot of room for character development so it is one reason to watch it. So overall &#039;Gakusen Toshi Asterisk&#039; is a good anime pick for the season.<br />

Ok, so this anime has ended , so what can I say? Well, one can&#039;t make a review of this anime without compering to another anime namely &quot;Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry&quot; or at least on the story (up) side, since it both features the same plot where it involves the female MC who met the male MC in a very awkward situation and plot wise, both partners have to compete in a contest that would pit their skills against another opponent . I mean if one where watching

          <span style="display: none;" id="review206057">
        both animes their is at 70% similarities, where I rather not discuss anymore details and both climaxes where focus on fighting the strongest female contender, which is why I gave this anime&#039;s category a 5. About this anime&#039;s art(up) thought there where some fanservice involve, it didn&#039;t focus much on it to sell, thought they did made Claudia and Violet&#039;s  bikini fanservice  a little bit bitchy, but the good thing was that it only appeared briefly, so that is why I gave it a 6 for this anime&#039;s art. Sound (up), actually I just have nothing much to comment on this anime&#039;s sound pertaiting to the VA who did the character&#039;s voices, but I don&#039;t have much love for both the opening and closing themes of this anime, so I just limit it to a 6. Charcter (up) ok, the relationship between Ayato and Julis maybe a bit in the ambiguous side given that Julis was just too pridish to admit that she like Ayato and Ayato was just this garden variety harem guy , it was still good enough to see the two being together and supporting one another so for that this category should be &quot;GOOD enough. Unfortunately this anime has introduced too many support characters that they&#039;re not given enough aired time let alone that those from diffrent school weren&#039;t that much of climatic when it comes to the competition, but still, it&#039;s &quot;Good.&quot; Enjoyment (up), since this is the season were I&#039;ve been watching 3 animes with a harem genre, my enjoyment was just limited as to how it will end and that&#039;s as &quot;FAIR as it can be, so overall (up)this anime was decent enough to such level that it didn&#039;t rely on the fanservice to sell, but it lacks it&#039;s own identity that it can be compared to  &quot;Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry&quot; , so season 2??????? Why not?<br />

    This anime is terrible. <br />
It&#039;s just another one of those SAO lookalikes that A1 is trying to pass as an original anime.<br />
The story is nothing special: Super strong boy meets somewhat strong tsundere hot girl that after only TWO episodes falls completely in love with him. Oh yeah, there&#039;s also something about a magical school and a competition. The world in not very well presented.<br />
The characters are simply walking, talking stereotypes. You probably won&#039;t even remember their names, only the character tropes. There&#039;s the very naive and powerful main character who doesn&#039;t get that ALL the girls are in love with him. There&#039;s the main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review207293">
        female lead who&#039;s a tsundere (not even a good one at that), there is the loli dandere (she is also not very well made cause she looks and sounds like the supercritical dandere, but she&#039;s very active and not at all shy nor quiet), there&#039;s the big boob loli girl who is completely depended on the main character and etc.<br />
The only reason why i&#039;m not giving this  the worst score is because the animation and the look isn&#039;t all that bad, even if the fight scenes are terrible. Ah yes, the fight scenes. The genre of this anime is ACTION! But the creators idea of action/fights is apparently flashing colourful lights really, really fast and hoping that you won&#039;t notice.<br />
But I must give credit where credit is due: the music isn&#039;t all that bad. This actually makes me even more angry because I believe that it&#039;s wasted on this terrible anime.

    WARNING: Review contains minor spoilers, as the show has almost no story and some one off events need to be discussed to get across the show&#039;s quality.<br />
<br />
Asterisk Wars is a series which has been derided by many and lauded by few, although the most common consensus to this show is likely &quot;average&quot;. In my opinion, though, the people who pointed out all of this show&#039;s flaws are pretty much perfectly on track: This show has an unlikeable and generic cast set in an ill-concieved setting with no plot to drive it and poor fights.<br />
<br />
Lets take it from the top. Our show begins when Ayato Amagiri,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246502">
        your standard flatbread hero, arrives at one of the six elite fighting schools, Seidoukan Academy, so he can be a fighter, as he is a Genestella which is basically a superhuman. The first action we get to see is him returning a handkerchief to a girl...by leaping through her open window?! What rational person does this, even if they can superjump places? It is a total invasion of privacy and instead of just, say, getting to her door and knocking, or shouting to her, or hell going to the window and saying she dropped it or any number of things, he just leaps into the open window of a total stranger&#039;s house. Inside is our female lead, Julis, and naturally since this is a harem series, that means we need to walk in on her dressing. Don&#039;t ask why a beautiful princess would decide to undress with an open, undrawn window where anyone can see, take pictures or so on of her.<br />
<br />
Unsurprisingly, Julis is upset about this! She is one of the top ranked fighters in the school and so you can guess her reply to this problem. The first few episodes are dedicated to showing off some of the main characters and exposition. Lots and lots of exposition, most of which isn&#039;t even true exposition, like Claudia telling the main character a bunch of terms and things about the city that the viewer will have no idea about. Right, on that note, the two other main girls introduced now are Claudia and Saya: Saya is one of Ayato&#039;s old friends and therefor has the hots for him, but we don&#039;t really get a lot of their history together, and she is your general emotionless girl or &quot;Dandere&quot; type. Claudia is the hot, very forwardly sexual student council president who flatout prepositions Ayato for sex multiple times (the first time, in episode 3, being a hilariously bad scene for Ayato&#039;s reply) and liking him for...really no well explained reason, she just kind of shows up to exposit at him and then wants to fuck him after giving him a strong weapon.<br />
<br />
A big issue is that all of these characters are pretty generic and have very little chemistry with each other: In fact, they very rarely even interact with people unless Ayato is directly involved and the focus, making them feel like they&#039;re just gone from the show when not existing, and we get very little insight to anyone&#039;s private lives aside from Claudia. Ayato is your generically overpowered main character, whose power seems to mostly be hitting really hard and his sword cutting things really well, with a cardboard attitude of &quot;I don&#039;t really care but I do&quot;. I should also note that most shows in this fight involve Ayato aaaaand are boring, with most of the first season&#039;s tournament arc ending dedicated to Ayato/Julis and the other MC teams casually curb stomping their opponents in under a minute.<br />
<br />
This is NOT how you write an overpowered main character. Overpowered main characters can work fine: For an example of that, Josuke from Part 4 of JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure would usually be considered pretty OP, with his stand Crazy Diamond being very physically powerful, pretty dang fast and having a potent ability to fix things. In fact, Josuke&#039;s stand for most of the Part 4, would be considered a lot stronger than the main antagonist&#039;s, but by giving the antagonist actual guile he becomes a menacing threat, and giving minor villains powers which can exploit Crazy Diamond through actual weaknesses, for example its short range, or having specialized abilities, ends up making some pretty great fights. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is practically based around the idea of the heroes being overpowered and weaves it nicely into the plot, taking a weakness and turning it into a plot strength.<br />
<br />
Ayato is just...generically overpowered. He can move faster than everyone and hit harder to everyone and generically power himself up with yells and special effects to be even strongerer and then he beats up his opponents! Not once does Ayato display any battlefield tactics, special skills (the special attacks he calls are almost all literally a sword slash that doesn&#039;t seem to be any different than normal) or abilities of note to make his fighting interesting. Its the worst way to write an overpowered MC, especially since naturally in a harem series this means things like beating up the highly ranked female harem members because they are generically not as strong as the AMAZING Ayato Amagiri and now they will fall for him or he will carry them in his arm because they totally couldn&#039;t do it themselves.<br />
<br />
Julis is your generic Tsundere girl who will probably be the harem winner. She has very few motivations and is one of the most blush heavy Tsunderes I have ever seen, even when she is going through the heavy Tsun parts, and her power is to control fire, which is never used beyond &quot;circle of fire trap&quot;, &quot;shoot fire&quot; or &quot;fiery explosion&quot;, and most of the time she shoots fire at people and they just get owned. Saya is small girl with a huge gun, which is only used to fire generic laser blasts. Claudia actually has some neat powers, dual wielding triangle lightsaber blades with an ability to see the future, but she doesn&#039;t actually get any fight scenes so. Kirin&#039;s power is &quot;has a sword&quot; and gets paired with Saya for some quite boring fights.<br />
<br />
Oh, right, Kirin. She&#039;s another main character introduced in a latter pair of episodes, which I hesitate to call a &quot;mini-arc&quot; given its anemic lack of plot or advancement, and is a 13 year old with large boobs which get way too much emphasis for her age and is also somewhat weird to have in Ayato&#039;s harem in the first place. She largely comes off as a superflous character who exists to give Saya a partner but since she is a female on this show she MUST also be added to Ayato&#039;s harem. Her voice also is very annoying even for the usual archetype and she has the spine of a jellyfish without actually acting abused enough to fit her supposed backstory. Also, she is somehow ranked #1 in the school when Claudia is #2. Kirin wields a normal, non-laser sword, one of the only people to do so in the show. Claudia dual wields lightsabers and can SEE THE FLIPPING FUTURE. The only possible explanation is Claudia does not give a shit.<br />
<br />
I also want to talk about a character who you would think is minor but frankly feels like he recurs as much, if not more, than Saya and Kirin: Lester MacPhail, whose name is quite literally pronounced MacFail. MacFail here is one of the most anemic attempts at a &quot;bully&quot; character I have seen in quite some time, being established as a loser who has lost to Julis 3 times but is itching to fight her and lose again. He is never displayed as a competent threat and nearly gets killed by one of the laser swords getting upset at him and flying around trying to murder him in a...hilariously awkward scene. He loses every fight he gets into, although SOMEHOW he is the one who gets the &quot;valiantly fights but loses&quot; fight scene to Irene, which if anything makes Irene look weaker by having to expend any effort on this failure. Its also hilarious because this guy is supposed to be kinda badass, like having built up muscle when Genestella are supposed to have trouble doing so, but he is basically a total loser in the show and one of the most pathetic strong man/bully types I&#039;ve ever watched. This makes him more endearing than most of the main cast!<br />
<br />
Finally for characters, I will mention Irene, the only decent character on the entire show: Pretty generic, sure, but her and her younger sister Priscilla are basically the only characters with actual energy or personality to them which helps makes any scenes in the show feel alive. She wields a laser-scyche (basically every weapon but Kirin&#039;s in the show is lightsaber-esque) which can control gravity and turns its user into a vampire because it requires blood to function. Since Priscilla can regenerate herself rapidly, Irene can feast on her blood to power up without worry, while she tries to just stay out of trouble, a somewhat interesting team dynamic. Their backstories are pretty generic and their powers are ill explained, but they are unique enough and Irene is the only character in the show who uses her power in a variety of interesting ways, making her basically the only character to be remotely competently done in this show, although her boss and essentially loan shark Dirk is decently set up, which naturally means she basically is put on a bus to end the season.<br />
<br />
Story-wise, there just isn&#039;t much to comment on. Ayato gets to the school, acclimates to the school a little, gets into some fights, meets Kirin and has some more random fights, then they go to the tournament and fight some jobbers until Irene shows up for a mini-arc to close the season. Ayato gets some very, very light setup for plot involving his sister, Julis and Saya get some weak motivations (help an orphanage she did stuff in as a kid, she wasn&#039;t an orphan she just hung there, and advertise her father&#039;s guns respectively) aaaaaaaand that&#039;s pretty much it. Backstory for the series is vague, with Apocalyptic Event causing super people to show up and a really terrible Megacorp to take the place of nations, which doesn&#039;t really factor into the show at all. The tournaments are supposed to be gladiatorial, blood filled spectacles to satiate the populace, but less people die in them than the infamous &quot;Hallway of Running&quot; from Hunter x Hunter so it reeeally doesn&#039;t show up.<br />
<br />
Sound-wise, most effects are dull and forgettable, with literal stock lightsaber sounds being used at times, and most background music is entirely forgettable. Not really good sound effects on the powers, either. The OP is fairly bad and that counts for a lot of the sound design, while the ED is okay, although stylistically even slice of life shows like K-On and Miss Kobayashi&#039;s Maid Dragon have done this ED style better. Art-wise the show actually usually isn&#039;t that bad, but it does suffer from not really having a very discernable style and bad looking effects in fights. The reason it goes down to a 2 is actually because of the horrible, Fates end of support style CGIs that are in the post-credits scene (usually involving Claudia), which already looked awkward in that, but here is done with way worse animation and ends up looking laughable and disturbing. This was so bad it dragged the animation score from a 4-5~ to a 2. Enjoyment is a 2 because it is a good show to talk to friends about the issues with and Irene&#039;s part was ever vaguely entertaining, but is a definitive 1 if you&#039;re not going to have anyone to go with.<br />
<br />
Overall, Asterisk Wars has quite little to get people involved and was a pretty miserable experience, if you want a good harem show there are far better options out there and if you want an action show there are far better options out there. However, it can be worth watching if you want to form your own opinion on it (it has ANYONE who likes it, after all) or because of all the analysis done on it, or simply if you like to ocassionally watch bad shows and see what happens. I&#039;m still going to watch Season Two, after all: I gotta see things through to the end.

    I tried this just to see what a truly terrible anime is. I thought there might be some sort of sick enjoyment out of the complete shittiness.<br />
<br />
And there is, but it&#039;s buried deep under an extremely thick layer of pure unabated rage.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll just say right now that I gave TAW exactly 4 minutes of my time. Because in 4 minutes everything was said. I watched Shinsekai Yori from the same studio, an anime I considered to have an excellent story and good characters but generally terrible production values and design. This is the same. Except the story and characters are shit too.<br />
<br />
So why am I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220764">
        writing a &quot;review&quot; from 4 minutes of observation? Because it was, and I&#039;m not being ironic, enough to be sure of a number of things:<br />
<br />
-This anime is godawful stupid<br />
-This anime is godawful lazy<br />
-This anime is just godawful, but with a special taste for mixing pretentious hardcore with stupidly stupid(I would have said lighthearted but come on, it&#039;s more stupid than anything)<br />
<br />
Story: A bunch of teenagers fight with swords because plot and the hero gets every girl on his penis. Think it&#039;s not enough? It&#039;s literally the entire plot of season 1. I checked. 1/10<br />
<br />
Art: In less than 4 minutes I saw a bunch of random 3D models in a generic blurred background. More than that the art in general is generic and lazy, the characters look nothing fantastic, they have a pink-haired girl with long hair in there and they manage to make her look sort of ugly. Considering that long pink hair is pretty much my exact taste in anime girls, I don&#039;t even get how they managed that. 3/10<br />
<br />
I was told the soundtrack is good and I want to believe it because less than 3 mins in I heard a super happy theme that was the most misfit and tone-shifting thing I heard in years. At 0:00 you&#039;re in a fight, at 0:05 the girl is crying in happiness and thankfulness, at 0:10 she&#039;s about to launch a fireball at the protagonist, and at 0:15 you&#039;re hearing the happiest theme there is. Was this even made by humans or computer generated by a first version AI attempting to appeal to us? So yeah it&#039;s a good soundtrack but if this is how they&#039;re going to use it, then 2/10 and holy god will anything about this not be completely lazy and sucky?<br />
<br />
Characters: In 3 minutes I met:<br />
-The teenager girl who is into a fight against a masked guy and says &quot;sorry x&quot; after she loses and dies<br />
-The teenager guy who x was, who is the most generic here-to-help-all guy who&#039;s also crazy strong and is flustered everytime a boob is even hinted at<br />
-Teenager tsundere girl with pink hair who manages to go from tsun to dere in less than 10 seconds then back to tsun then pulls a magic blast and destroys everything. And who could look a lot less shit.<br />
-The teenager director(?) of the school who&#039;s as smily as her tits and sex drive are huge.<br />
 I would put 0/10 if possible, but I guess it&#039;ll be one. Pathetic is certainly a good definition, there is NO EFFORT at all. I won&#039;t even dignify this schlock with the word &quot;characterisation&quot;, but at the very least, if your characters are shallow, make them fun. Here the production values are so low, the story is told in such a slingshot way, that even something as simple as a tsundere character comes off as false, and as not fun. I mean come on, could you get any lower for a professional studio? Actually don&#039;t answer that, I&#039;m afraid of the answer.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10 without irony again. If I could swallow this inane schlock for more than a few minutes I would probably find an extremely powerful sick enjoyment out of hating this with every cell of my body. Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, I can&#039;t, and I have less terrible things to watch.<br />
<br />
Overall: I didn&#039;t stop 3 minutes in because it was shit. If that was it, I&#039;d have stood it to at least the end of the episode. No. My mind refused to carry along with this tremendous piece of lazy, barely shoved out crap, after two lines:<br />
-After this event(the genostella children), the world was changed and a new order was made by [insert organisation whose name I can&#039;t even remember and who controls Asterisk Island]<br />
-Due to the changes, a new morality was born in the world<br />
-And now, panties<br />
<br />
WHAT? ARE YOU ACTIVELY TRYING TO FUCK WITH MY REMAINING BRAIN CELLS?<br />
<br />
You literally took 3 sentences to go from &quot;a new world order&quot; to &quot;a new morality and set of social values&quot; to &quot;PANTIES&quot;!<br />
<br />
Do the people who put this mindless crap on the market even know that you can&#039;t throw stuff like &quot;new world order/new morality&quot; without actually showing how or what? That&#039;s like saying &quot;and thus the greatest soldier ever was born&quot;. But then we don&#039;t see the soldier, we don&#039;t know how he fights, or even for whom.<br />
<br />
I have never seen such a sharp, poorly done storytelling in my entire life. I literally dropped it right then and there, paused the video, tried some more but the damage was done. In less than 4 minutes I was convinced that this wasn&#039;t just generic and poor, it was also horribly told and had absolutely no idea of what it was talking about. And lots of shows are generic and mindless, but this one is lazy and veeeeery poorly made to boot.<br />
<br />
If I ever want to hate anime, I&#039;ll be sure to come back to this.

    Ah, harem.  The genre that I mostly find myself gravitating towards is the one that has to do with lots of girls and only one guy.  (Don&#039;t judge me.  We all have our favorite genre.)  So, with Fall 2015 coming to a close, we have Asterisk, a show that...really isn&#039;t much different from the rest of the harem shows out there to be honest.<br />
<br />
Story: The age of Genestella came when meteors rained down and sent the world into near extinction, but surprisingly, not as many people as you think died.  As a result of the fallout, a new society was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review206080">
        formed, one where people now possessed magical powers and were able to wield weapons made from the stones in these meteors called &#039;Luxes&#039;.  And here, we follow the story of Amagiri Ayato, a boy who enters one of 6 schools (Seidoukan specifically) and enters the Phoenix Festa in order to find out what happened to his missing sister several years back.  Then he comes across a girl named Julis who starts to snap at him because of no fault of his own and  well, you get the idea.<br />
<br />
Asterisk is generic.  There&#039;s no way around that fact.  The show focuses on Ayato as he progresses through his life at Seidoukan, entering the Festa, and coming across various characters along the way.  Most notably, harem members.  And really, that&#039;s about it.  He meets someone new (or old, since Saya is childhood friend), helps them, moves on.  Even during the fighting festival, he manages to help other girls in that.  Because of this, there really isn&#039;t much to say about the show.  The fact that it&#039;s generic makes it so that a lot of the plot points are very predictable, a lot of what happens doesn&#039;t really add much tension, and nothing really stands out as extraordinary or noteworthy to talk about.  It&#039;s not really bad, but at the same time it&#039;s not really good.  It&#039;s rather bland and I really can&#039;t express that any more.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
-  Generic <br />
-  Nothing really noteworthy to say about this show<br />
-  This is just filler text.  Because there&#039;s nothing interesting to really say about Asterisk&#039;s story, I thought just add in this little bit so I could have three things in this section of the review.  <br />
<br />
Characters:  The characters in Asterisk reflect its story, by being as uninteresting as they can be.  (Because we all love anime tropes, right?)<br />
<br />
Amagiri Ayato is...well, what&#039;d you expect in an anime like this.  He&#039;s a harem protag who&#039;s entire purpose in this show is to seek vengeance (or something) and help out any female human he possibly can before converting them to the Ayato religion where they worship his holy D.  (Sigh.  We&#039;ve seen this a million times.)  As such, he doesn&#039;t really have anything unique about him to talk about.  Maybe the fact that he&#039;s not as OP as other harem protags that fit this category, but I don&#039;t think that deserves mention.<br />
<br />
Then the girls.  Let me line them up for you.  <br />
<br />
Julis = Token Tsundere<br />
Saya = Kuudere Osananajimi (childhood friend)<br />
Kirin = Dandere Imouto<br />
Claudia = Sexy Onee-san<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t think I really need to elaborate more, do I?  Ok.  Moving on then.  <br />
<br />
As for other characters, well, they&#039;re not really all that important, according to the plot.  Most of the characters really serve to be plot-based and move what is happening in this series behind the scenes.  Others on the other hand are meant to be the main focus of the show, (aka, the harem girls), and as such are treated with a little bit more screentime.  Don&#039;t expect a lot from these people.  Most of them aren&#039;t really that interesting aside from a tiny handful.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
-  Bland characters<br />
-  Most of the side cast is meant to move along the plot<br />
-  So, how&#039;s your day going?  (I ran out of things to talk about again.)<br />
<br />
Art: The art for Asterisk is something that I would say has more worth on it than its story and characters combined, and then some.  While the artstyle isn&#039;t really all that fantastic in terms of originality since it all pretty much looks the same as a lot of anime these days, the fighting scenes and its effects look pretty, so I&#039;ll give it that much.  Everything else, pretty standard.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Nice fight scenes<br />
+/- Pretty standard animation<br />
<br />
Sound: The sound for Asterisk is also something that has a little bit more worth to the show as a whole.  Its OP &quot;Brave New World&quot; has a very techno and fast-paced feel that actually sounds rather good and fits with the show.  <br />
<br />
The ED on the other hand is another track that is rather nice to listen to.  It&#039;s quite somber and has a mellow tone to it that&#039;s relaxing and calm to listen to.  It&#039;s a good set of tracks to a not so very good show.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  Good tracks<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment:  It&#039;s a harem; I tolerated it because of that, so there.  I&#039;m not going to do my usual stuff because there really isn&#039;t anything good or bad to say about this show.  It&#039;s generic, and that enough should say enough about it.  It&#039;s a rather bland experience that doesn&#039;t leave too much to think about, and as such, isn&#039;t really worth talking about.  I don&#039;t hate it, I don&#039;t love it, I&#039;m just indifferent to it.  If you want to watch a generic harem...well, you can watch this one.  A lot others are honestly crappier than this one.

    Well...Gakusen Toshi Asterisk started off pretty good like any other harem-ecchi anime series but went the episode went by, it became garbage and it does have a common plot that can be found in other animes.<br />
<br />
Story : 6<br />
Actually I&#039;m not too sure about the plot but I&#039;m sure it revolves around some random Magical Fantasy Schools participating in a competition and the main character finding the truth about his older sister. The competition is about some Magical Fantasy Fighting Competition which up till now I still do not understand their powers and stuff relating to it. With the anime being completed, the ending ends off

          <span style="display: none;" id="review206261">
        with a fight and some unnecessary fan-service. Which I think is a bad ending considering that I did not understand it <br />
<br />
Art : 9<br />
That art was pretty good as it shows the vibrant colours and the Art Directors must have spent large amount of time reviewing the art and improving it. And this is one of the good things and maybe its the ONLY GOOD THING about this show.<br />
<br />
Sound : 8<br />
The opening and ending was pretty good and the voice actors and actresses have played their roles perfectly.<br />
<br />
Character : 3<br />
Just like any other harem shows, there are unnecessary fan-service and annoying characters that always ruin the good moments of the show. It is very disturbing to find that it is also wasting screen-time. Although I&#039;m a Fan of harem animes, the rating of 3 is mainly because of the annoying characters trying to act cute but got rejected by the main characters <br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 4 <br />
This show was not enjoyable and I&#039;m not even expecting myself to be watching Season 2 which would be airing next year <br />
<br />
Overall : 4<br />
Overall, The only good thing about this show is the Art and Sound but the rest is really terrible and horrible. <br />
And Therefore I Warn Everyone Who Is Interested In This Show To Not Watch It.<br />

    I&#039;d say spoiler alert, but if you&#039;ve been watching anime for more than a month you already know how plots like these work out.<br />

          <span style="display: none;" id="review232004">
        a fight.  She gets her ass spanked in the fight.  Harem consisting of Tsundere girl, big boobs girl, childhood friend girl, and loli girl forms between episodes 1-3.  Ayato ignores sexual advances of girls, romantic subplot never goes anywhere.  He remains an unbeatable god for the duration of the series.  THE END.<br />
<br />
The plot is pathetic.<br />
<br />
The art is pathetic, animators shamelessly use CG figures and flashy colors to make it seem like stuff is happening when really all they&#039;re doing is swinging around swords with no choreography whatsoever.  On a scale of 1 to Fate Zero, The Ass War earns a √-1.  It&#039;s so bad, it&#039;s UNDEFINED.<br />
<br />
The sound is pathetic.  Effects sound bad, opening is horrible.  The only redeeming quality here is the ending, but that only brings sound up to a 2.<br />
<br />
Characters are all pathetic, generic, lifeless, and boring.  It&#039;s as if their personalities were picked from a hat.  It&#039;s so static and mind-numbingly bad I wish I could give it less than 0 on MAL, but I can&#039;t.  There&#039;s not a single shred of character development to be had anywhere in this show, and the relationship between characters literally never changes once they are established.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment?  I actually enjoyed it immensely.  It&#039;s always fun trashing these kinds of shows!  I still rate it a 1 because if I have to base enjoyment off the actual show instead of discussion.<br />
<br />
Overall?  This show is the worst piece of garbage to have crawled out of the light novel trash heap.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s pathetic, appalling, and deserves an average score of 1 on this website.  I can&#039;t possibly fathom how it&#039;s &quot;earned&quot; over a 7 on this site.

    Well, here is my honest opinion about Gaskusen Toshi Asterisk. It&#039;s to short for it&#039;s own good. It tries to give a good and a little complicated story and plot, but because of it&#039;s short run time (will change when the new season comes out in april 2016 hopefully) the goal of the plot becomes unknow. I mean sure, so far its about a group of magical warriors who fight in a tag team fight tournament and the winner(s? not sure) can make their/his or her wish come true if it is in the power of the current world to fulfilll.<br />
<br />
In the end of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review211968">
        season they teaser that something might have happend to the protagonist his sister and that we might know the villian. I am looking forward to the second season to find out what will happen, but thats also the problem. The first season doesn&#039;t make much sense without the storyline yet to come and thats why i can only give it a 6 for now (might review this season again after next season has aired)

    Despite the obvious flaws of having a generic, weak, uninspiring plot and being filled with fan-service-y scenes... Not to mention it has harem...<br />
<br />
Despite all of that, I thought the characters in Asterisk are pretty cool. They have thoughtful discussions and face their problems in a reasonable manner, unlike most other shounen anime where people collide and scream at each other for no apparent reason. The MC also isn&#039;t annoying and emotionally naive like, again, most other shounen anime&#039;s MCs. Those traits for me are a big plus.<br />
<br />
Even if the story itself isn&#039;t interesting, I think you could give it a shot if you&#039;re prone to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313810">
        liking those alternate, cyber-ish world-settings (e.g. if you somewhat liked Mahouka).

    If you are a big fan of DxD or Rakudai then this is for you.<br />
<br />
The plot has some rather interesting elements to it students from multiple schools are competing it a tournament in pairs, it appears that a number of them have some end goal for doing so and this will and has lead to some heated exchanges. The story has a few mysteries to it a few shady characters or an incomplete back story leaving you wonder what will happen next by no means is it mind blowingly good but it&#039;s also not completely irrelevant it&#039;s about a 6-7 for now but looks to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review211613">
        be heating up for the next series.<br />
<br />
By no means is this the best Anime in this category but by no means is it the worse, if you are a fan of shows like Rakudai or even DxD then you most likely will enjoy this show, it&#039;s not as the same standard of those two shows the characters in this are rather bleak the more interesting characters are the one&#039;s who make very few appearances in the show, but as the second cour is coming soon i would only assume they will be a big part of that meaning that there is something to look forward to.<br />
<br />
The show has a good visual and audio element to it the art style is well done and both the OP and ED are rather good and in general the sounds throughout the show are just crisp.<br />
<br />
<br />
At the moment i would rate this show probably what it&#039;s MAL score is of about 7.2-7.3 as someone who likes these show&#039;s it&#039;s certainly enjoyable but nothing really stands out Rakudai bettered it in almost every category.  <br />

    Story: 4/10<br />
<br />
Story focuses on students who are wielders of some kind of Light Sabers thanks to some kind of super powers they posses (they didn&#039;t explained them at all). Eventually they take part in big tournament where they fight 2 vs 2 with other students. They dreams may come true as a prize cause everyone have some kind of desire.<br />
<br />
In reality it&#039;s another, typical harem with story focused on grand tournament where our MC&#039;s have to win! There&#039;s nothing special, the romance is bad, ecchi is bad, harem ain&#039;t good at all..<br />
<br />
Characters: 3/10<br />
<br />
Well.. It&#039;s even worse than story. Our Protagonist-Kun is typical, boring MC who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review207187">
        doesn&#039;t have &quot;eggs&quot; at all. Literally, hot girl invites him to stay a night and he refuses.. Other than him we have mentioned by me Princess-kun who is tsundere and is also typical harem character. We also have little, no booby childhood friend who lacks expressions and is jealous of booby-one girl our Protagonist-Kun met during his school time.<br />
<br />
For real I enjoyed side characters way more.. even If they air time is like 10 minutes in total.<br />
<br />
Music: 5/10<br />
<br />
It&#039;s nothing special but it&#039;s not that bad. Voice acting is just okay, altho i don&#039;t like Princess-kun voice. Sounds are meh, BGM is meh. Techno-like music during fight is okay. Overall music is just decent, okay?<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
<br />
Basically this is the strongest part of the show.. Animations and fights are good.. of course i&#039;ve seen way better animations but I&#039;m gonna let it be. Art is pretty standard, nothing special. Character design is not good, standard harem set. I liked side characters design more, for instance our Vampire.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6/10<br />
<br />
The score is high because i like that kind of shows when I am kinda bored and some fight and story of Vampire is quite good for me but that&#039;s just my opinion.<br />
<br />
Overall: 5/10<br />
<br />
Tl;Dr:<br />
<br />
It&#039;s standard harem story with bad romances and nothing special in it. Literally everything is just okay and nothing more. It&#039;s decent anime which you can try when you are bored or you&#039;re really out of other titles.
