    During this period, the anime industry suffers &quot;Material lacks&quot;. Ideas are getting narrower but productions are getting wider. Many companies suffer to bankruptcy, and to anticipate this they must broaden the marketing ground. In order to broaden it, they throw many adaptations to stabilized the situation. Because of it, there is dozens adaptation appear in various sources. One of those sources is game. But the truth is until this period, not many game adaptation live up to its expectation.<br />
<br />
Divine Gate, is a smartphone game developed by Acquire. While the animation is in the hand of Studio Pierrot. As the series went, there are some flaws

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214297">
        that can be spotted.<br />
<br />
As the story goes, they do throw out dozens of information to construct the world building. Unfortunately, it failed. There are too many things unexplained things and the story doesn&#039;t start explaining things but keep throwing information dump, hoping the viewer felt a mystery thingy. And if it&#039;s too late to explain those things, this can cause a backfire to the plot and can wreck any of the plot elements, make the story felt pointless. All of the elements could be floating in the water without any clear directions. The anime have a hard time to compel dark themes to the story, the truth is the story was failed to bring that feeling. It has terrible exposition and dull storytelling.<br />
<br />
Next one is flashbacks. The anime didn&#039;t use the flashbacks effectively and producing a slow pacing to the storyline.<br />
<br />
Animation quite decent, characters have different colorful designs. While there are some scenes using CG, but the fighting scenes still tolerable. The World seems to be set with advanced technology, with robots, gadgets and other futuristic elements occur.<br />
<br />
Background music seems to be mediocre. Seiyuu do their job fairly. There aren&#039;t anything that can outshine this anime except the OP theme. It&#039;s quite catchy itself.<br />
<br />
Divine Gate wanted to be more focused in characterizations than story, they trying to develop the main characters at the early episodes, but it&#039;s failed in the execution, the anime more like want to explain how it&#039;s their past, not more or less. It tries to blend dark past to the character but failed to relate those past with the story.<br />
<br />
After episode 7, I&#039;m totally disappointed by this anime. Divine Gate has a huge number of supporting casts. The bad thing is those characters are not getting any single development. They&#039;re purely just a plot device to help the fight more dramatical, which make it more pointless. <br />
<br />
Divine Gate is a great example of a pathetic attempt to draws many viewers as quickly as possible. It has been coated into 12 episodes of disaster with forced conclusion in the end. This anime really makes you don&#039;t want to watch anime again, so it is obviously not recommended.<br />
<br />
So what is Divine Gate? Even Einstein can&#039;t answer this.....<br />
<br />
Overall 2/10

    Divine Gate is the absolute worst show I&#039;ve ever had the displeasure of watching to completion, let&#039;s go over a rundown of our characters and what they&#039;re trying to do.<br />
<br />
Before you go any deeper let me explain that this isn&#039;t a review, this is a complete summary of this series and why you should never, NEVER watch it.<br />
I&#039;m not going to bullshit you with any of the plot or on their names either, it&#039;s really going to be as bad as it sounds.<br />
<br />
The Divine Gate is basically an all powerful wish granting device and it was used previously to inadvertently tear apart the borders between

          <span style="display: none;" id="review217374">
        the realm of the gods, spirits, and Earth.<br />
<br />
We have our protagonist Blue, his &quot;friends&quot; Green and Red (yup, those are their names) Blue is the suspect to a very serious massacre that happened years ago but there&#039;s an adapter academy that doesn&#039;t actually have any classes that wants to recruit him to join their school (adapters are people capable of using supernatural elements). A boy named Arthur is something like the student council president and has The Knights of the Round Table featuring a bunch of ripped off names left and right such as Lancelot. <br />
<br />
When Arthur was a boy he was sent to some other world to escape something, while here he met a young boy who called himself Santa Clause. Ever since Arthur met Santa he&#039;s been bent on restoring order to the world by using the Divine Gate to segregate the realms to their original planes. Arthur seems to be friends with 2 gods that find him interesting for whatever reason and so they say they&#039;re &quot;observers&quot; of how he plans to go about reaching the Divine Gate; Loki and The Wizard of Oz... The world is run by a &quot;council&quot; which doesn&#039;t necessarily explain how order is kept. The council isn&#039;t against the idea of Arthur seeking out the Divine Gate but pulls more of a &quot;We don&#039;t care if you try to get there, but if you get there we&#039;ll have to kick your ass&quot; kind of approach towards him. <br />
<br />
And so begins Arthur&#039;s adventure to the Divine Gate, naturally he brings all the members of the Knights of the Round Table but also invites our 3 little classmates Blue, Red, and Green. Arthur opens a portal which everyone goes through to start their journey to the Divine Gate which basically is a seemingly endless amount of hallways with additional doors to open until you finally reach the gate. Halfway or so through these endless corridors our heroes are met by the Scandinavian gods, who were sent by the Wizard of Oz with super powered weapons to &quot;stop&quot; them from continuing their journey, and so the Wizard of Oz knows just how powerful these gods with these weapons are and knows there&#039;s absolutely no chance for them to be defeated. Oz assumed Arthur and friends will turn tail and give up on the Divine Gate, but that doesn&#039;t quite happen. they fight their hardest, until just about everyone that&#039;s a part of the Round Table becomes a sacrifice to allow Arthur, Blue, Red, Green to continue going through the corridors. The Wizard of Oz finds out the Scandinavian gods killed everyone and starts to act like he&#039;s all butt hurt over sending his pals to kill everyone, so then he tries to make things right, by crying about it. After narrowly escaping the Scandinavian gods Arthur and the color brigade have to face the next trial before they can reach the Divine Gate, which is that everyone attempting to reach the gate has to have experienced a massive amount of despair. Arthur is excluded from needing to go through despair, Blue has been through despair his whole life being abused by his family because he wasn&#039;t supernaturally gifted &quot;yet&quot; while his brother was loved by them, Red thought his father had died in a lab accident, and Green had a childhood friend that wanted to be her &quot;one and only best friend forever&quot; and Green was like &quot;that&#039;s too heavy, why can&#039;t we just Netflix and chill?&quot; and her best friend was like &quot;I don&#039;t understand!&quot; and runs off never to be seen again. so now Loki joins the fray with his pal Shakespeare who has the ability to write a story that traps whoever she wants within an illusion to act out a play. Amidst the entrapment set by Shakespeare, Red meets his deceased father and believes it to actually be him, but then realizes that he was too nice to be his father and dissipates the illusion, as for Green she meets her long lost best friend within the illusion and then realizes it&#039;s not her because she said it was fine that they didn&#039;t need to be the best of friends. Immediately after breaking free of the illusion, Red is faced with his real father who actually isn&#039;t dead and said the council used that as a cover up, but just as they rejoice to find each other again, one of the Scandinavian gods shows up and his dad tells him to escape while he fights off the god, naturally his dad really dies this time right in front of him and he experiences enough despair to reach the gate, then we move on to Green, after her illusion she&#039;s confronted by her long lost best friend; who had actually been with the Wizard of Oz this whole time for some reason and changed her name to Dorothy. You know what happens next; that&#039;s right, a Scandinavian god shows up and kills her right in front of Green. Blue has to fight to the death against his brother who was the actual culprit of the massacre years ago, but Blue loves his brother he can&#039;t just kill him. so then Blue defends himself until he has to retaliate and his brother&#039;s all like &quot;I knew you didn&#039;t love me, because you wouldn&#039;t let me kill you!&quot; and then he walks off, so now that everyone has the appropriate amount of despair to get them to look at the Divine Gate they go through the final corridor and reach the gate, the color brigade then uses their powers of despair to open the door to the Divine Gate to let Arthur inside, but soon as he gets in there Loki shows up and now it&#039;s time for Arthur to pull out Excalibur and fight Loki off, Arthur loses of course but he&#039;s not really hurt, Loki throws down a demonic mind control sword and says &quot;just grab that sword and everything will be okay&quot; and of course he picks the sword up after saying &quot;you won&#039;t take control of me!&quot; and then he gets mind controlled. Soon as he gets mind controlled Lancelot who miraculously survived the onslaught of the Scandinavian gods shows up and runs to Arthur asking how things are going, and mind-control Arthur stabs him through the chest just to make sure none of the Knights of the Round Table survive. The color brigade knows better than to fight against mind control Arthur and Loki so they get outta there real quick and plan to come back for Arthur later.<br />
<br />
So they&#039;re back in town and the council knows they got to the Divine Gate and even though they didn&#039;t get to use it they&#039;re so mad that they&#039;re gonna pull the color brigade in for questioning and send them to prison. They had a guy who was like their friend at school who says he&#039;s gonna help them explain themselves and so he runs off to see the council, when this fucker comes back he literally brings the swat team to their hiding spot and is like &quot;JUST TURN YOURSELVES IN YOU CRIMINALS!&quot; and then Santa Clause shows up through some magic portal for the first time in front of the color brigade to help them gtfo of this mess, the color brigade is like &quot;how we gonna trust someone named Santa that carries around a bat with nails in it like some delinquent&quot; and eventually they&#039;re like &quot;alright let&#039;s see how this goes&quot; and then Santa goes berserk mode on the swat team and they get the hell outta dodge.<br />
<br />
Santa&#039;s got a plan, they&#039;re gonna go back to the Divine Gate and rescue Arthur so they go back through the endless corridors and get to the Divine Gate a second time, so they get there and the color brigade is totally talked out of using the Divine Gate because they&#039;re told &quot;is your wish worth changing the entire world?&quot; because any wish made would have the fabric of the universe change for some reason but then the corridors start to collapse and shit&#039;s falling everywhere and so they just up and get the fuck out of there, didn&#039;t even save Arthur yet or anything. They&#039;re outta there and are greeted by Lancelot and everyone now is just like &quot;I THOUGHT ARTHUR KILLED THIS GUY?!&quot; and then he&#039;s just like &quot;Nah, all the Knights of the Round Table are safe too&quot; after we saw them all die, and then Lancelot&#039;s like &quot;We&#039;re gonna get Arthur back though&quot; then you hear the council say &quot;The location of the Divine Gate cannot be confirmed.&quot; <br />
<br />
BAM series ended.<br />
<br />
There are slight minor details I skipped over obviously being that I don&#039;t want to recall this pile of shit, but I think most of it is right there for you to understand.<br />
<br />
I hope you never watch this series because oh my god it was horrible.

    As a player of the original game &quot;Divine Gate&quot; who has at least some knowledge on the original story, I had some hope on this series before. Unfortunately, cramming such a convoluted story (involving dozens and dozens of characters, five different worlds, and having probably storylines that couldn&#039;t be counted by one hand) that would be otherwise more fitting for a multiple-storyline novel into a 12-episode anime proved to be an absolute disaster.<br />
<br />
Story: 1/10<br />
<br />
In a nutshell, the story is a kudzu plot full of irregular jumps. Allow me to briefly outline what happened in the first 7 episodes.<br />
<br />
1: Introduction and Aoto&#039;s flashback<br />
2: Aoto accepting the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review211670">
        call and Akane&#039;s flashback <br />
3: Aoto in school and Midori&#039;s flashback<br />
4: Blue Christmas <br />
5: The Seconds<br />
6: Divine Gate chores<br />
7: Evil Arthur<br />
<br />
The three flashbacks in EP 1-3, albeit occupying most of the episodes, are unresolved and disconnected to each other. The jump from Blue Christmas to the Seconds to Divine Gate in EP 4-6 is even more of an eyesore, almost like they are merely poorly-placed information dump. <br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
<br />
Quite good. The fighting scene between Aoto and Samidare in EP4 is particularly well done. I deducted some points for the designs of various characters like the Nordic Gods, though (just google their original versions in the game and the anime version, and you will immediately know the graphic decay).<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
<br />
It&#039;s probably one of the few redeeming features of the adaptation. The OP, one-Me two-Hearts, is a catchy song, and numerous OSTs, like the one playing on Aoto&#039;s reflection in EP1 and Midori&#039;s one in EP3, also enhanced the otherwise bland scene (which, in my opinion, falls into wangst for the lack of character development as will be described below).<br />
<br />
Characters: 2/10<br />
<br />
Another direct result of squeezing dozens of characters into a 12-episode anime. The first 3 episodes zigzag between Aoto, Akane and Midori&#039;s background without even giving us some time to develop sympathy towards them. The various threads are left unwound for the next 4 episodes. Hikari, Yukari and Ginzi are not even properly introduced until EP5 (and then, they are merely shoved away with a &quot;tell, don&#039;t show&quot; description that will not make any sense to anyone who hasn&#039;t know them in the game before). <br />
<br />
And there are serious problems of &quot;What happened to the mouse?&quot; (laconic: characters disappear all a sudden without any apparent addressing) for many characters, like Ifrit, Undine and Sylph, the Seirei-ō 精霊王 that should be guiding the protagonists; Samidare, the machine that should be in Aoto&#039;s possession; so on and so forth. <br />
<br />
Oh, and for the part where Aoto finally addresses Undine by her first name in EP6? I don&#039;t even know why that happened all a sudden. Poorly enforced character development.<br />
<br />
But the greatest victims so far are the Knights of Round Table. Amond the 12 members, only probably half of them actually showed up in front of the protagonists, and only Breunor and Bedivere are properly named. Then there comes Episode 7, and we are expected to show some shock and sympathy over their fates...<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3/10<br />
<br />
The random mumbling of K and the ubiquitous poem recitations ruin the scene. End of story.<br />
<br />
Overall: 3/10<br />
<br />
I have dropped this anime, feeling the adaptation will go to nowhere. If the whole thing doesn&#039;t even ring a bell to a fan of the original game like me, then its meaning to the general audience is self-explanatory. I can only hope that the game developer will spend more effort back to the original game (irrelevant to the anime, but the rate of update of the game has slowed down considerably after the plan for the adaptation), and that Gungho will learn a lesson for the next adaptation of PADZ.

    *spoiler-free*<br />
What happens when you bundle up all your favorite anime ideas and tropes and dump them into one anime? While I would say this anime, it is really hard to discern what even happened in this anime to find out, but dissecting it anyways!<br />
<br />
Story: All in all, the story is well a mess. Constantly shifting focus from episodes to episode, there really is no clear main character nor main goal in the anime except for the idolized Divine Gate. But a lot of the time, the Divine Gate really just feels like its there and then everyone else is just sobbing about how they want

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214064">
        it. There were a lot of cool concepts from technological sci-fi world with robots and elemental drivers that gave you cool weapons but besides that, the story is too confusing and underdeveloped<br />
<br />
Art: The art for this anime is gorgeous! While it isn&#039;t mystifying or particularly memorable or even matching really a certain mood of the anime, the art is clear and polished, and a lot of the character designs and environments appear dazzling. Honestly, the designs of the main characters are great, but they lacked something about them that just would have made it all clicked. Oh right, their actual personalities.<br />
<br />
Character: No character was thoroughly fleshed out. The anime starts off focusing on the woeful life of depressed water boy. Seems ok, but then the anime switches to the two government worker kids, earth girl and fire boy, without much transition and tries to detail us on all the reasons why we should empathize with their sorrow and need of the Divine Gate. Except its all terribly done for such a convincing synopsis idea, there lies little emotion nor compulsion for character actions in both their pasts or the present, so even when we get explanations, they don&#039;t make sense or fail to evoke any feelings of compassion.<br />
Furthermore, practically every other character isn&#039;t explained at all but the anime tries to make you pity them or understand their warped ideas. The other 3 kids that the anime tries to show off as a contrasting trio? They add NOTHING. They randomly appear, and while they look cool and their contrast is cool, they literally follow the group around, disappear, come back but with opposing mentalities, only to be dragged off the show for an arbitrary reason (like really dumb and random reason). The anime will add a ton of government workers as characters and all of them will have backstories, and unfortunately, none of them are detailed and they all are basically minions until their deaths(?). (so imagine the Angel Beats cast except the useless half is twice as useless). Overall, poor character development.<br />
<br />
Sound: You won&#039;t notice the sounds of the anime sadly, because there will be an obnoxious omniscient kid narrator constantly reading you ALL THE CHARACTER AND PLOT DEVELOPMENT, leaving nothing to be characterized by characters&#039; actions, emotions, or backstory. Nope, a dude walking down the street? Suddenly, &quot;the man felt regret as he walked down the street, alone as he had always been.&quot; Indirect characterization exists for a reason folks. It makes characters more human and creates an empathy link, but when I&#039;m told that someone hates themselves, it&#039;s like k. cool.<br />
But the opening song is rather catchy and probably the most promising thing of the show. if you only watched the opening music video then you would probably think this anime is really good.<br />
<br />
Etc: So a lot of what I just complained about revolves around the fact that the anime tries to be something it is not. It acts like a vague mystery anime, reaching for some salvation and human futility undermined by the Gods (imagine the obscurity of Mekaku City Actors, the confusion of Steins; Gate, and some cool elemental concept of powers. Mush them together with Gorilla Glue and that&#039;s what you get), and this causes a lot of characters to be left out because the anime is indecisive. It wants to tug at your heart strings but it also wants you to try to warp your mind around it. It has a cool plot concept which would earn it a solid 7 if it went the typical shounen route or something, but it reached too far and ended up being incomplete. Lots of potential, but it&#039;s just a Jack of all trades and a master of none.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: You&#039;ll find yourself liking the first 3 or so episodes. They&#039;re not too bad. But then after that you&#039;ll start not comprehending things and things become loose and silly. Character behavior becomes inexplicable and trifle. But you really liked the idea of teens with element-charged weapons fighting similar counterpart adults for a all saving deus ex machina goal, so you keep going. But you won&#039;t find anything, just like this anime did, and that is why I give it a 6/10. Most people will find this anime, overall, unenjoyable, regardless of tastes.

    (First review and all that so forgive me if there&#039;s some stuff I missed or didn&#039;t explain correctly).<br />
<br />
Where to begin with this absolute abomination of an anime.<br />
<br />
The story is a convoluted mess. The writing is appalling. The dialogue is awful, and the attempts at being poetic, especially in the first episode, were so cringe worthy it hurt. The story seems to jump between episodes, often giving little explanation as to what the characters are doing, why they&#039;re doing it or why the audience should even care. The characters are especially unmemorable, each having their own motivations for finding the &#039;Divine Gate&#039;. Unfortunately, their reasons are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review215761">
        either unclear, boring or just plain stupid, making it incredibly hard to get invested or root for any one of them. None of the characters are interesting in the slightest, perhaps with the exception of Aoto. (Is he the main character? Is the fire guy? Or green girl? Forgive me for being unable to remember their names, but it seemed to start with the show pushing Aoto as its main character before moving on to the other two then just giving all of them the spotlight without actually doing anything with them. By the end they just seem to exist because they&#039;d already been introduced and the writers couldn&#039;t come up with anything more for them to do after the &quot;plot&quot; shifted and seemed to focus more on Loki and Arthur and their situations.) Aoto caught my interest in the first episode but then that quickly went downhill when he turned out to be nothing more than a whiny, angsty kid with family issues. The story finishes on a terrible cliffhanger, not solving anything. Please God don&#039;t let a second season be made, please.<br />
<br />
The art isn&#039;t terrible but it&#039;s nothing to write home about. Battles, when they do happen, aren&#039;t difficult to watch and occasionally looked decent. (The battles, for me at least, were the only enjoyable thing about this show but they seemed to fade towards the end). Animation is okay, not particularly impressive. The show looks like an average anime.<br />
<br />
The sound is a mixed bag. The OP is fantastic and I never skipped it. (Same goes for Luck &amp; Logic and that show was baaaad too but I digress). Voice acting is okay, but no-one stands out. The soundtrack itself...well, aside from the OP, I can&#039;t remember another track, but nothing was terrible.<br />
<br />
This show was an absolute pain to slog through every Friday. 25 minutes of boredom watching angsty teens try and reach this mythical &#039;Divine Gate&#039;, which I&#039;m not sure of what it even does, with rare moments of fun when battles occurred, was not enjoyable, at all.<br />
<br />
If it&#039;s not apparent, I hate this show. So, so much. The story is pathetic, the characters boring and it was exactly the opposite of what, I think, anime should be. Enjoyable. Fun to watch. Ah well, at least it gave me a great OP.

    Okay, this anime was the cancer of the Winter 2016 season. How bad could this be you may ask? So bad that I wanted to drop it but continued anyways to write this review so you people would know never to watch this. Well lets continue on with this review.<br />
<br />
Story 1/10: <br />
Well this was one of the worst things about this anime. I didn&#039;t even understand what the heck was going on during the entire story. Nobody understood what happened in this story from what I could see on the comment sections of KissAnime. It&#039;s so hard to follow this story at all. It just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214132">
        jumps all over the place and seems like the writers didn&#039;t even care. Nobody cares about half the things that happen in this story too. Even the confusing story of Mekakucity Actors was still better, more straightforward, less confusing, and more interesting than this story. The backstories in this anime are also god awful. They don&#039;t make you care for any of the characters at all unlike what a backstory is suppose to do. Even the backstories of the characters of Mekakucity Actors was much better than this. Some other stuff that never made sense in this series was the entire play mini-arc of the series, getting to the divine gate, and like everything else in this series. <br />

Art 5/10:<br />
So the art wasn&#039;t that bad in this anime. It was smooth and pretty beautiful in some scene. For me though, I just could not get used to the unusual art style of this anime and didn&#039;t really like it that much but that&#039;s just me. Some scenes also look amazing but others just look god awful. Most of the time, it looks decent. <br />
<br />
Sound 5/10: <br />
So to be honest I only think that the opening of this anime was good compared to the rest of the sound tracks and the anime for that matter. Maybe it&#039;s because the opening is the most prominent song you will hear in this anime but most of this soundtrack is pretty forgettable. <br />
<br />
Characters 1/10:<br />
One of the worst things in this anime. Once again like what I did with my Sky Wizards Academy review, I&#039;ll go through many of the characters that I can remember.<br />
<br />
Green haired girl:<br />
Boring bland girl with backstory nobody cares about. Kinda annoying and has a normal character design.<br />
<br />
Red hair guy:<br />
Some arrogant dude that I would like to see die in a hole. You can&#039;t bring yourself to like this kid and for me, I just wished he just died. <br />
<br />
Aoto:<br />
So backstory is about being abused by parents and some brother leaving or something like that. 1st part sounds like something from this season *cough* Erased *cough*. Easily forgettable too. <br />
<br />
Arthur:<br />
Blond dude that wants to go to the divine gate and also makes tons of decisions that doesn&#039;t kinda make any sense.<br />
<br />
Loki: <br />
Okay so this character is sort of interesting with an interesting character design. Wants to rebuild the world or something for some random reason.<br />
<br />
Oz: <br />
Some dude that appears for like 15 minutes in the entire show and you really don&#039;t care about him. He apparently is some sort of god but I don&#039;t really know due to this anime not explaining anything<br />
<br />
Dorothy:<br />
Some childhood friend of the green haired girl. Don&#039;t really care about him and has some personality shift from the past to the present. Loved by Oz apparently. <br />
<br />
Red haired guy father:<br />
Some guy who appears for 10 minutes in the entire anime and it expects you to love him and care about him. Don&#039;t even bother.<br />
<br />
Aoto&#039;s brother: <br />
Appears again for like 10 minutes and you don&#039;t care about him. <br />
<br />
Nordic gods:<br />
Okay so these people would have been interesting but they are sadly wasted and just put on the sides to die. <br />
<br />
Elemental teacher people:<br />
So 3 girls that you don&#039;t care about at all. <br />
<br />
Shakespeare: (yeah there is someone named Shakespeare in this)<br />
Some random green haired girl that comes out of nowhere and you probably will not care about at all. <br />
<br />
The rest of Arthur&#039;s army: <br />
The army of Arthur that appears for like 2 episodes and you will never care about even though the anime tries hard to make you love them. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 1/10:<br />
This anime was a drag to watch. The first few episodes may have been interesting but it fell off and was like watching Sky Wizards Academy again. The ending of episode 12 also made me rage. If you ever watch it which I recommend you don&#039;t you will want to kill yourself if you watched everything and didn&#039;t skip to the end. Don&#039;t even attempt it. <br />
<br />
Overall 2/10:<br />
Some of the most important parts of an anime, the story, characters, and the enjoyment of it really bring this anime down. The art and the sound though help to bring it up to something better than the absolute worst of the worst. Please save the time you have and watch something that is not this piece of crap.

    I really have never found such an amazing anime in the past four years of watching daily. This show made me KEK harder than I&#039;ve KEK&#039;d in a long keking time. This review will be spoiler free.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: With an immediate sense of who the characters are at heart and their troubles in the past Divine Gate really gets you excited quickly. Any parts of the story that seem unclear are explained efficiently with the flashbacks in the episodes to come as the flashbacks are few in number and are highly informative. The story follows multiple characters and their own personal grief and what they have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review215992">
        to do to rid themselves of the guilt that has swallowed them. This is all done with the help of the expert writers at the forefront of this anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: Words cannot describe the beauty that this shows art style has. The mixing of 2D and 3D make the fight scenes not only entertaining but interesting to watch and then re-watch later. I&#039;ve never seen an art style capture the story within it so well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: The soundtrack of Divine Gate really made me hyped up during the battles that happen throughout. While I&#039;m not much of a sound critic in particular I will say that the music during the battles was quite enjoyable. The opening is quite amazing I have downloaded it on to my phone and wish to play it on the piano.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Character: They&#039;re all great, every single one. I&#039;m not a huge fan of Akane but having someone that you don&#039;t like as much really shows why the others shine so brightly KEK sorry Akane.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This was my first review and I hope it made you want to go out there and watch Divine Gate right away! It will not be a mistake.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sincerely, BGdealer

    I watched 7 episodes and I couldn&#039;t continue this. For me this anime was bad, maybe very bad. <br />
<br />
- The story itself could be good, if they used it better maybe they could make something average, maybe even good. The idea was nice but they failed in developing it. I couldn&#039;t tell what they wanted to do with it because it was so chaotic.<br />
- The art was.. how to say it.. it wasn&#039;t bad or good.. it had some 3D effects too... but I didn&#039;t really enjoy it.<br />
- About sound - I liked both opening and ending. The seiyuu and sound tracks weren&#039;t bad too..<br />
-

          <span style="display: none;" id="review216491">
        The characters were pathetic, very pathetic. It&#039;s not that It had poor character development, It hadn&#039;t it at all. They were just put there with no character. Maybe they had a history behind them but for me they looked like dolls without souls.<br />
<br />
I was watching this with thinking - when it will end? How much time I have to an end? <br />
Maybe I overrated it with this 4/10.. but I let it have it.

    The first anime I&#039;ve ever seen that had nothing to do with boobs. Thank God. Doesn&#039;t really end, tho, and isn&#039;t perfect, so only 8. I&#039;d write more but I just really need to point out that it is the first anime that is the most equal, the most feminist friendly, and was just absolutely fun to watch an anime that didn&#039;t pander towards Otaku. Don&#039;t get me wrong, the plot is a bit lacking, and the characters are a little flat. I didn&#039;t even realize the last episode was the last episode? But nonetheless, if you want something decent that you can safely watch,

    Divine Gate is, by any means, not &quot;divine&quot; at all.<br />
<br />
The story is your run-of-the-mill &quot;let&#039;s obtain the MacGuffin&quot; (that being the Gate) plot line, which really has no impact all the way through the end. The first half is establishing the back stories of the main characters that has no payoff. There was hardly any &quot;search&quot; for the Gate in the first place. The ending was just a jumbled mess with an anti-climax that I didn&#039;t bother caring about anyway. Plus, there is a literal &quot;deus ex machina&quot; in the finale (if you&#039;ve seen it, you&#039;ll understand).<br />
<br />
With characters, the only thing I liked about them

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214208">
        were the concepts. They have names based on things like color, the gods, medieval, and even the Wizard of Oz. That&#039;s all I liked about them. As actual characters, they&#039;re bland. For the ones that get the back story treatment, like I mentioned before, have these payoffs that are mediocre and are put to the side like it was nothing. Speaking of, there are there set of characters that were given no purpose whatsoever. They&#039;re supposed to be &quot;important&quot;, but in reality are completely useless.<br />
<br />
The animation is probably the only thing that&#039;s eligible for praise. I liked the character designs and the color schemes used for each. There is also a strange but interesting blend of 2D and CG in this. While, for the most part, the characters are 2D, scenes where they fight are done with CG models, and it&#039;s not distracting at all. Also, the background is done in this CG that looks like an old computer game, and I liked that contrast between that and the characters.<br />
<br />
Still, with uninteresting characters, a story that is rushed about halfway through, and overused themes that come off as pretentious, Divine Gate is like the big finale of firework that turn out to be a weak little &quot;pop&quot; (that&#039;s the only kind of metaphor I can come up with).

    Obviously this show went over a lot of people heads. It was actually an amazing anime. The fact that it was able to surprise without losing consistency and keep on point all while being clear what&#039;s going on was a fantastic asset. <br />
<br />
The incorporation of gods and the references to famous medieval people was brilliantly done.<br />
<br />
The show also incorporated the use of Happiness and Despair to a perfect degree. A lot of original Ideas came out of it. No other anime that I have watched has used a plot like that before. <br />
<br />
The only real criticism that can be had here is the deus ex

          <span style="display: none;" id="review271811">
        revive. <br />
<br />
Overall the show deserves a 9/10 at worst.<br />

    Overrated. The anime was made half-baked, the characters are super annoying, I can&#039;t see the point of the story, and it&#039;s uninteresting. I only watched this because the graphics are nice, well.. looks can be deceiving.<br />
<br />
One more thing, it fails to give the enjoyment and thrill viewers are looking for when they are watching a new anime. It&#039;s a waste of time, truly disappointing. The anime really wanted to impress the viewers, rather than to express, that&#039;s why it was really overrated. <br />
<br />
Every episode, my only reaction is &quot;What the heck??!&quot;<br />
<br />
I really hate this anime, everything is annoying, particularly the dialog of the characters. It&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220819">
        really nonsense to watch this anime. I can&#039;t believe i finished all the episodes. <br />
<br />
I will nominate it as &quot;The Worst Anime of Winter 2016&quot;

    Seriously... I really expected too much from this anime and i&#039;ve never wrote so bad about an anime in my life i think.<br />
Anyway, this anime is about 3 kids trying to search for the divine gate hence the name because they have their own problem.<br />
<br />
The story is bad but not normally bad, it&#039;s really really bad, i didn&#039;t understand a single thing throughout the whole anime.. And the ending so disappointing, it&#039;s like they wasted 12 episodes in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Story :<br />
Like i said before the plot is bad, it became bad after the first couple of episodes (2-3), many thing left unexplained and the ending

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214200">
        seriously, it&#039;s so disappointing and waste of time, that this became the worst anime of the season instantly.<br />
<br />
Character :<br />
Well they did develop the character by focusing on the background story most of the time until the end which by showing those story has achieved nothing or close to nothing.<br />
<br />
Art :<br />
Nothing special, you&#039;re everyday art these days.<br />
<br />
Sound :<br />
The only thing that was good about this anime was the opening, it feels like they have wasted it on such an anime full of plotholes.<br />
<br />
Overall :<br />
Bad and in my opinion not worth watching, seriously it&#039;s a waste of time unless you want to watch some plotless anime..

    Do you wish to watch an anime with a story that doesn&#039;t make any sense? do you want to watch an anime that confuses you all the way through? do you want an anime where the ending doesn&#039;t resolve anything? do you want an anime where things happen and exist with no context, reason or explanation? do you want an anime where even when they a wrapping up the plot in the final episode nothing is being wrapped up at all except for the entire anime in more confusing shit? do you want an anime where the only thing worth watching each episode are the

THEN THIS IS THE ANIME FOR YOU!<br />

Diving Gate is a confusing anime where the only thing that happens is more and more confusing sentences are spouted at you with the sole purpose of confusing you more.

    I&#039;m a person who rarely gives a grade below 6, but in this case I had to.<br />
From what I understood there&#039;s a gate, called the Divine Gate that if you reach it you can modify the whole world the way you want it<br />
The story is fair, if it was told the right way, it could be good, but they made it so bad.<br />
<br />
This anime is an action, fantasy and sci-fi, so it is mainly an action anime, which is not good, the fighting scenes are short and most part of them are pretty bad. Basically the most important part for this anime to be good

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214950">
        was bad, the only way to save this anime was the course of the story, that didn&#039;t saved it al all, also this is not a complete anime, it doesn&#039;t ends the story, it ends urging a new season.<br />
<br />
The art has some 3D aspects, they are not bad, but neither are OK, I would say they are mediocre, 3D animation actually is something that usually doesn&#039;t please people, so that makes it worse for the anime image, even the 2D animation is not good.<br />
<br />
The sound, if I have to say I think it is the only thing that is actually &quot;good&quot; of this anime, the OP is pretty good, the ED is good, the OST are fine.<br />
<br />
The characters are pretty bad though, they have bad motivations, they have strange pasts, and made strange choices all their life, the protagonist is very dumb though, he is always blaming himself for things he didn&#039;t do, there are characters that according to MAL are main characters, but they hardly appear, I really can&#039;t understand it, the others main characters are not bad, but also not good.<br />
<br />
I did not enjoyed this anime, don&#039;t really know why I watched it until the final, I think in the two or three last episodes I was curious about what would happen, maybe that&#039;s a good point about this anime, I recommend you not to watch it unless you really have nothing to do.<br />

<br />
Story 6/10: There&#039;s a lot of action and fighting scenes for the characters on their quest to search for divine gate who wishes to change their past. It was okay, but there are times where it seems that they have dragged on for too long.<br />
<br />
Characters 7/10: There was a lot of characters that are introduced in the series. They have cool powers called &quot;Drivers&quot; &amp; they are based on the elements (like Earth, Fire &amp; Water). Akane is honest and straight-forward. His Driver is the power of FIRE. Aoto is very distant and monotone. His driver involves the power of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review218484">
        WATER. Midori is very cheerful and happy. Her driver has the power of WIND. There are also some references to the medieval timeline &amp; fairy tales (i.e.: Shakespeare, King Arthur &amp; Lancelot, Loki &amp; Oz -- who I&#039;m pretty sure is has a contemporary look/reference to the Wizard of Oz). There was a really cool character development on the main characters that explores their past &amp; reasons of going to the Divine Gate.<br />
<br />
Overall enjoyment 6/10: As I said previously, a lot can happen in 12 episodes! I enjoyed watching it. It was ok. I just don&#039;t like seeing the good guys dying. I hope there is a season 2 that can let us continue seeing the characters grow and see their fates afterwards. There&#039;s a lot of sad moments and action scenes that makes you shocked but wanting to continue finishing the series.

    Ohhh does the video game anime adaptation curse strike again with a boring confusing vengeance!<br />
<br />
So what lies behind this Divine Gate?...grandiose bullshit...just grandiose bullshit.<br />
<br />
Divine Gate is an anime adaptation of a smartphone game and LA will immediately put this anime adaptation under the various amounts of horrible video game adaptations before it and it god damn well shows it.<br />
<br />
Diving Gate from such a simple premise, they manage to f*ck it up royally. Let&#039;s get the first problem out of the way, this anime is up it&#039;s own ass pretentious grandiose bullshiting it&#039;s characters and plot all together, what does LA mean by this?, well most

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214097">
        of the main cast members get their character development and backstories told in some of the most pretentious and on-the-wall annoying trying desperately to sound grandiose that they strip the plot and plot armor down to outright boring and pretentious.<br />
<br />
LA gets it we have the Akane voiced by &#039;&#039;Tetsuya Kakihara&#039;&#039; the fiery-hot head with daddy issues and he has the element of fire, Midori voiced by &#039;&#039;Kanae Ito&#039;&#039; the wind user with friendship issues with one of her childhood friends and is the typical genki girl but is really depressed and finally we have Aoto voiced by &#039;&#039;Soma Saito&#039;&#039; the water user who had a typical tragic backstory just thrown at us over and over and over and over and over and over and OVER again ohh did LA mention he&#039;s a water user and doesn&#039;t even eat anything hot...just god damn really?.<br />
<br />
See what LA means by on-the wall annoying?. Divine Gate also has terrible pacing issues from trying to go into too much detail about the characters to hardly telling us what &quot;Divine Gate&quot; even is besides a generic wishmaker that wishes it was the Holy Grail from &#039;&#039;Fate/Zero&#039;&#039;.<br />
<br />
Divine Gate is more worried and focused on it&#039;s characters backstory that they hardly give any focus on the plot at hand and when they do, they rush that to no end, LA NEVER got invested in ANY of these characters, the closest character LA got to like was Midori only because everyone else wasn&#039;t the depressed elemental idiots they embodied and even before the halfway point even Midori got succumbed to it that LA just gave up on characters altogether, how about the fact that there is a group of characters that later on get killed off for dramatic purposes only for the anime to forget that we hardly knew them so in terms of plot progression or character development from that group were almost meaningless.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation, the animation was at the very least by Studio Pierrot decently animated although there were times where the battle scenes go into 3D CGI for no good reason, however even with the &quot;decent&quot; animation it doesn&#039;t help solve the utter trainwreck of plot and characters. <br />
<br />
The ending?...well that&#039;s a laugh, making characters deaths pretty much moot and the entire ending just circle-jerks you into caring but it just becomes pointless and just telling a dumb message of &quot;we control our own fates&quot;...and making the vaguest mess of a rushed climax against the main villain it just leads to this entire anime being JUST POINTLESS.<br />
<br />
Divine Gate for LA is by far thee WORST anime for the Winter of 2016, it has rushed pacing to no end, grandiose character development too cliched it&#039;s pretentious that by that end almost worthless characters to get invested in and lots of minor characters that get the axe just for sympathy points. We get it Divine Gate, your trying to be symbolic, however when that symbolism is soo blatant and pretentious that&#039;s what makes you boring and annoying as hell, that&#039;s why your the worst anime of Winter 2016 for LA.

    I watched this show when it was simulcasted and have been too busy with other things than to be writing a review for this.  I would like to state this show is pretty much a waste of time to watch. if you have seen a trailer it might look pretty animation wise but does not cover the hot mess this show is. <br />
<br />
Story 2/10<br />
<br />
The first two episode where ok story wise but what followed those two episode where the following problems. The only story the viewer are interested in after watching the first two episodes is the story of Aoto. However they decided to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review217420">
        mike in a load of subplots and introduce a load of characters over the course of the ten episodes that follow. Other problems include pacing that was extremely fast and loads of flashbacks that don&#039;t help the viewer understand the characters better but only make things more confusing.  <br />
<br />
Art 7/10 <br />
<br />
the only plus with this series is its art style. In the first few episode its ok however in other episodes some of the art is lacking. Character designs are also the only plus with the series however looking cool didn&#039;t make the characters any more interesting.  <br />
<br />
Sound 4/10 <br />
<br />
some of the sound effects used seemed highly repetitive while the opening being the only decent song in the ost. <br />
<br />
Character 3/10<br />
<br />
This series had a lot of characters with a lot being introduced  especially in the middle episodes. It felt like the plot was just introducing characters in general. The three mcs who take most of the screentime are introduced in the first episode as confident heroes who are going to battle a lot of enemies while in a majority of the series they just stand around and watch other characters just introduced fight. The bad guys like the good guys are introduced in large numbers and not seen again till the end except for the villain loki. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 2/10<br />
<br />
When I finished the show I was happy It was done in hope of something better will take its slot next season. <br />
<br />
Overall 4/10<br />
<br />

    hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha<br />
no<br />
Don&#039;t even think about watching this, its not worth your time <br />
Characters <br />
These are perhaps one of the most one dimensional characters that i have seen in a while. Whats worse is how hard the writers try to make the characters interesting with backstories.  I adore characters that have a solid backstory that adds to their progression.  This way I can see and appreciate how far a character has grown and changed.  This doesn&#039;t happen with this show.  The characters have nothing to them but their backstories. After a while these characters become so unenjoyable because of their obsession with their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214764">
        past that they becomes really cheesy and unbelievable.<br />
And don&#039;t even get me started on the main protagonist. Hes probably the most annoying &quot;tragic&quot; character there is.<br />
Art<br />
 while at first seems appealing it later dissolves into cgi the anime and becomes almost unbearable to watch.  They tried to make the anime artistic by creating bright colors with the backgrounds and the characters but it really didn&#039;t work.     <br />
Sound <br />
Boring. Only the opening is fun but that&#039;s about the only thing I can give props to this show.  I remember nothing about the soundtrack and I just finished watching the thing.<br />
Story <br />
Confusing and ends with a lackluster ending with what I guess can be considered a cliffhanger. This maybe would have worked better if this show would have been expanded but I kind of doubt it. Whats frustrating about this story is how hard they tried to make it philosophical with its constant dialogue of choice and the idea of changing the future.  With a setting and characters that seem stuck in the past this really doesn&#039;t really work.<br />
So in conclusion<br />
nope<br />
Maybe watch this if your drunk and you want to laugh at a really bad show

    This show is great if you are looking for a show which will give you more questions than answers and will leave you debating if you should even put in the effort of watching the next episode.<br />
<br />
Plot lines are rushed for example episode seven seemed to be three episodes squashed into one. Some characters are introduced and then almost completely dismissed while other character appear multiple times yet don&#039;t seem to have names.<br />
<br />
All for a mediocre at best ending. <br />
<br />
To me it seems that the only purpose of the show is to draw you in with an interesting backstory and then leave you utterly confused

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214428">
        hoping the next episode will answer your questions (Hint: It wont). <br />
<br />
All in all if you want good art and sound and a good opening but nothing else that makes sense Divine Gate is for you. If not don&#039;t waste your time watching 12 episodes of this.
