    This movie is receiving a whole lot of backlash for the CGI-animation (it&#039;s a TV movie with a limited budget, guys, not a cinema release) and the &quot;dissappointing&quot; plot, but I thought the movie was fun. Not as good as other Ghibli movies, but still entertaining the whole way through.<br />
<br />
The movie is basically about Aya (or Earwig) getting adopted by a witch, and the witch wants to use her as a slave. Earwig has to figure out how to escape or make things better for herself, or live in torment forever.<br />
<br />
Earwig herself is very different compared to most Ghibli protagonists. Even though she&#039;s taken advantage

          <span style="display: none;" id="review373949">
        of to no end, she&#039;s never seen crying, but annoyed instead. She&#039;s also really good at manipulating people, and even though this isn&#039;t usually a good trait, it&#039;s very useful in the situation she&#039;s in. The witch is... well, basically a witch, and Mandrake is one of my favorite Ghibli characters ever. I won&#039;t spoil why, but you&#039;ll understand why when you spend some time with him. There&#039;s also a talking cat, but it&#039;s hard to talk about him without spoiling the entire movie.<br />
<br />
The art itself looks pretty nice. The Ghibli character design looks rather generic in 3D, and even though it&#039;s pretty obvious the animation had a limited budget, the characters are still pretty expressive. Just don&#039;t expect Dreamworks/Disney/Pixar quality. The environments are beautiful though: lots of small details and very colorful. Can&#039;t say much about the music as I don&#039;t remember much of it, but the ending theme was cute.<br />
<br />
But the most important thing: was the movie fun? Yes, I think it was. After reading the reviews here, I was expecting to keep looking at my clock so I would know when the torment was over, but I was entertained all the way through and thought the movie went by fast. Maybe too fast, especially towards the end, which was rather unsatisfying. It&#039;s like they&#039;re teasing a sequel. It&#039;s a very laid-back movie with minor drama, so don&#039;t expect the thrill other Ghibli movies have. It&#039;s more of a comedy with some drama here and there, and I&#039;m just fine with that. But I&#039;ll say this: it&#039;s just as imaginative as other Ghibli movies are, and the characters are interesting even though they have minor development. I&#039;ll recommend this movie to all Ghibli fans, no matter how old they are. I think there&#039;s something for everyone here, as long as you don&#039;t expect too much.

    I already had low expectations from this movie since it was being directed by Goro Miyazaki and mainly because it abandoned the old incredible Ghibli art style but this movie was way worse then what I was expecting. The trailers had given me a bit of hope and I thought that maybe this movie might turn out to be decent but no! <br />
<br />
Art(6/10): I was very disappointed and lowkey pissed when I saw they were not doing this movie in the original art style but I ended up thinking they did a pretty ok job with the CGI, it looks like the characters and some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review373835">
        of the environments are made with clay at times but overall the movie looked fine and I was happy to see that they animated the Ghibli faces and facial expression pretty damn well for a CGI movie. I just hope that they never do this style again and always make movie with hand drawn anime style! Every moment in the movie I was thinking to myself this would have looked awesome if they made it the original way.<br />
<br />
Story(1/10): The story in this movie really is dreadful, it is super bland and generic. All that happens in the movie is that the protagonist gets adopted by a witch and you can predict everything that happens after that since its so basic. Also the movie way to quickly when I finished the movie I had to double check if that was it and yes it was. <br />
<br />
Characters(3/10): There is close to no character development in this movie, every character is bland and boring and the main protagonist doesn&#039;t even feel like a Ghibli protagonist hell this entire movie doesn&#039;t feel like a Ghibli movie and the cast also is very very bad. The only character that had some development was Mandrake and even his development was very generic and predictable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment(2/10): I didn&#039;t enjoy this movie at all I hated it, I thought the animation was ok and they nailed the faces pretty well but it didn&#039;t feel like a Ghibli movie I was waiting for it to end. It was so boring that I even started yawning, If you are a 6-7 year old kid you might enjoy this movie but I dislike it a lot and I absolutely will not recommend this to anyone! Well at least we have the final Hayao Miyazaki movie to look forward to that will most likely be an awesome film!<br />
<br />
Verdict: Don&#039;t watch it terrible movie, uninteresting and bland characters and animation that feels like clay at times. I would rate this at best a 4/10.

    I share the same sentiment as many others who&#039;ve watched this movie: it was disappointing. But stay with me here, that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s not worth watching!<br />
This movie is based off of an incomplete book that the author died before finishing. Why make a movie like that in the first place? I dunno... the film seems to remain around the same amount of incomplete as the source material, so there isn&#039;t much of a plot or main conflict. (There is a set-up for what the plot was supposed to be, but once you get half-way through the movie and there isn&#039;t any word on it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review373908">
        you realize the movie isn&#039;t going anywhere with it.)  <br />
This turns it into more of a &quot;slice-of-life&quot; movie. You just follow the main character after she gets adopted by a witch and watch things unfold. And that, all things considered, is fine with me. I enjoyed the movie. It has a quirky cast of characters, cool music, and something new to many of us, CG Ghibli animation. Which by the way, is quite good, so don&#039;t worry. <br />
So, I&#039;m disappointed that we didn&#039;t get to see the whole intended story, and I&#039;m also disappointed that we didn&#039;t get more plotless slice-of-life time with the characters. But, it&#039;s a cute movie. Family friendly, but not too childish. If you&#039;re okay with just sitting down and watching something, I recommend it. It doesn&#039;t follow the typical &quot;rising action, climax, resolution&quot; movie formula and that&#039;s ok. Don&#039;t write this one off. I think the other ratings are a little harsh.

    Do you know Studio Ghibli? He is one of the best known names when it comes to animation, filmography and respectable staff. It is a studio that has gained notoriety with many important films for the industry and has fans all over the world. Children, youth, adults and the elderly ... Everyone who accompanies animes at some point is faced with some of his feature films produced. And of course, this is more than just merit. It was an achievement, the popularity of making animations in film format, something little seen before its creation. Today, Ghibli is known as the &quot;best studio&quot; by many people.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377112">
        And, in fact, he has reason to be considered a great producer. At the end of 2020, but seen by the majority in 2021, Ghibli went further, evolved his way of making films and produced his first film completely made in CGI. Aya to Majo premiered, but does the film deserve importance and Ghibli&#039;s legacy?<br />
<br />
First, it is good to separate animation and production from the story of the film, as it is necessary to understand the reasons why the criticisms for and against exist in that title. Aya to Majo is no big deal. Basically, Ayatsuru (or just &quot;Aya&quot;) is an energetic and mischievous girl, who lives playing games in the orphanage where she lives. She was left by her mother as a baby, but that never shook her, as she fully relies on her friends for everything. She has an important friend, Custard, in whom she has a special affection. But everything changes overnight, when a very bizarre couple decides to adopt her: Bella and Mandrake. Both have magical abilities and Bella is the couple&#039;s witch, while Mandrake does the job of being a &quot;demon&quot;. Aya, just like anyone who would be adopted in her place would think, strange and fear the couple. But her curiosity for magic changes her relationship with the couple, especially when she becomes Bella&#039;s assistant. From there, the film is based on comedy, games and very cool and interesting mysteries.<br />
<br />
The plot is simple and seems to follow American films from Disney and Pixar, where fantasy and the children&#039;s audience are the main objectives. It is really an art show, in view of the great effort that the staff had with this show. As much as it is only 82 minutes, Aya to Majo delivered something beyond what most expected. And this is where I want to demystify, commenting on his production.<br />
<br />
The quality of the anime is above many other content that we see year after year, released on Japanese TV. This is a good thing, since movies and anime in television format with this quality are quite difficult to have. Even with the improvement and refinement of art and setting techniques, whether in drawings or in CGI, many shows are hampered by the time they have to make an episode, or deliver a finished scene. Shingeki 4 is a current example that faces these difficulties and has a strong and negative reception from a portion of fans, where the effort of an entire team is being literally disregarded, as if it were easy to make more than 30 thousand frames per episode. Exhaustion and psychological pressure are fundamental problems that need the attention of the industry. Aya to Majo apparently managed to reverse this negative picture of animes and delivered an excellent experimental work. It&#039;s a new chance for all studios and streaming platforms to make anime more innovative. CGI can be good, art can overcome with time and anime can use it as a new method of work and professionalization.<br />
<br />
Going back to the film, what bothered me was neither of the two topics presented, but a lack of structure to keep the show interesting. Aya and Bella practically occupy the entire anime and their daily lives are the central focus. In addition, Mandrake raging is also well used. But, I felt that the lack of a better text and of development harmed the show itself, since it was, for the most part, weak. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s just an opinion of my own, but I expected Aya&#039;s birth mother to appear in some more natural way, which it didn&#039;t. The anime also did not have a purpose, because the childishness and function of the story is just an attempt to convince the target audience that everything presented is cool and pleasurable. Of course, it is a show for children, I am not the target of the production for that very reason, but I hoped that Studio Ghibli would further improve this determining factor. Incidentally, the direction also did not know how to make a finale very well, nor did it improve during the scenes. It was just a fun that got tired, it was repetitive and that will be very little remembered by the otaku.<br />
<br />
Overall, Aya to Majo is a decent film. It does not lack visual qualities and it is really deserved praise for its production. But aesthetics and history didn&#039;t go together this time. The anime does not entertain the most diverse in this type of media, nor will it mark generations, like Totoro and Chihiro. It is a pity, as its influence has the potential to reform the industry. However, the film has a quality that I liked. Children&#039;s comedies are things I really appreciate and like a lot. Congratulations to Ghibli, for doing a show like this. The studio brought the main essence easily and remained one of the most important organizations in the history of anime.

    When you have a product with a differential, whatever it may be, something that makes it unique and places it above competitors, you don&#039;t just throw it away, you don&#039;t waste it. I know Ghibli was never one to think in terms of profit (they make movies at a rate of 5 mins per month), but why? Simply why? Was it for the sake of experimentation? Was it because the times are changing and the studio needed an upgrade? How many of us, as its more or less loyal audience, think that computer animation is, in whatever form, good or bad, an upgrade for the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review383060">
        most artistically emblematic animation studio in cinema history?<br />
If you watched the 2013 documentary on Studio Ghibli you remember when Hayao went to see a screening of his son Goro&#039;s first feature. He seemed to have been cringed the f*ck out of his senses after watching his son emulate his work beat by beat in a desperate attempt to gain his approval or some other daddy issue thing.<br />
We were all cringed out Miyazaki after watching &#039;Earwig&#039;.<br />
Oddly enough, the master did oversee the process of writing himself: he holds a credit for story development. You could even say this is a strong point in the film, but I could argue otherwise. I think probably the most uncomfortable thing here was to see the old beloved Ghibli formula, if there is such a thing, beaten to death with software. And I don&#039;t mind sounding anachronistic, because we&#039;re talking about being artistically cohesive, not adapting to the times. The Ghibli narrative style was birthed alongside an aesthetic approach and both work symbiotically. To divorce them is to lose the differential, to keep one but throw the other away is more than just to throw us out of our comfort zone, it is to murder in cold blood that which we all held sacred: artistic cohesion.<br />
Now suppose for a second that as an audience we&#039;re willing to leave all that behind, and that we&#039;re open for a change of direction. Couldn&#039;t you at least make the movie look pretty? Again, &#039;Ghibli reinvented&#039; sounds like an extremely hard, however interesting thing to do creatively, but &#039;classic Ghibli undertones dully reproduced in plastic&#039; does not. It&#039;s like watching a loved one being Frankensteined, you sort of awkwardly both recognize them and not.<br />
It&#039;s like everything comes together to make this look like a hate letter from a son to his father. The distancing from hand-drawn animation is distancing from Hayao Miyazaki himself, it is a statement. Even the old grumpy, absentee father figure-type character who literally only says &quot;don&#039;t disturb me&quot; every five minutes - Goro was gracious enough to take that phrase in its repetitiveness and turn it into a rock and roll riff for the movie&#039;s main theme song, which he wrote himself. A sort of symbol for what it means to use art as a means to deal with the pain of growing up in a conflicted household, I guess.<br />
The more or less active participation of Hayao in the early stages of development of the movie carry out a meaning in itself, also. It&#039;s kind of passing the torch over to the next generation, but reluctantly. He once defined himself as a &quot;positive pessimist&quot;, and while &#039;Earwig&#039; has given us hope that the gates at Studio Ghibli are still open for business, it has shown us that after the master himself is gone, the party&#039;s over. In that sense, I think every Ghibli fan right now is a positive pessimist.

    This film is an embarrassment and a hideous stain on Studio Ghibli&#039;s mostly immaculate track record, the same way Cars 2 is for Pixar. Goro Miyazaki isn&#039;t anywhere near his father in talent but I at least enjoyed From Up on Poppy Hills and somewhat enjoyed Tales From Earthsea but this is just too much. I am genuinely astonished at how awful this film was and couldn&#039;t wait for it to end. The characters are bland and uninteresting, with the Mandrake having the most potential but he barely gets any screentime. The animation is absolutely putrid to watch and I was dearly wishing it was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review399013">
        simply hand drawn like the animation in the ending credits. There is no real plot which by itself is fine since My Neighbor Totoro didn&#039;t really have one either but this film is also incredibly boring (even more than the tear inducingly boring Ocean Waves) and lacks any kind of charm or sense of wonder. I truly struggled to stay awake even with its short runtime. Sound is mostly fine I guess. Don&#039;t remember the soundtrack at all though, but the voice acting was decent (but then again, I&#039;ve yet to watch an anime with bad voice acting).

    Well, I never thought there would be a day that I thought a Ghibli movie was not just bad but possible one of the worst films I’ve seen this year.<br />
<br />
Earwig and The Witch is the latest film by acclaimed Japanese animation house Studio Ghibli but their first film to be done completely in CGI. It was directed by Goro Miyazaki, son of the legendary and infamously hard to please Hayao Miyazaki who’s track record has been sketchy at best. He previously directed ‘Tales of Earth sea’ which used to be considered Ghibli’s worst movie, but he also did ‘From Up on Poppy Hill’ which was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review380366">
        good overall. Unfortunately, this film does Goro’s reputation no favours.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Plot:<br />
Earwig and The Witch is about a young girl named Earwig, living in an orphanage where she gets states she can get everyone to do what she wants and doesn’t want to leave. Then a Witch and a demon named the Mandrake come to adopt her, and they do. Despite saying she doesn’t want to be adopted, Earwig is totally cool with being kidnapped by these two monsters who outright state they want to use her as child labour because she might be able to learn magic and take control of the house like she did in the orphanage.<br />
<br />
For the next hour and ten minutes, that’s pretty much it. Earwig is given tasks to do by The Witch, she attempts pull a prank or get the upper hand on her captor, fails, briefly feels homesick and goes to bed. This cycle repeats around four times in the movie to the point that me and my friends joked that The Witch’s barking demands seemed like an NPC straight out of an RPG with how repetitive her dialogue was.<br />
<br />
[MINOR SPOILERS]. This all finally changes when Earwig finally uncovers a secret about the Witch and Mandrake’s past. They were in a rock band. After that, the film flashes forward a few months Earwig is now master of the house, the other two are now her slaves and the film end. It just as out of nowhere as it sounds as if the whole third act was cut from the film. It’s confusing and destroys the few morsels of build up or progression the film had. I’ve heard the reason for this was that the original book by Diana Wynne Jones (same author as Howl’s Moving Castle) was unfinished and also had an abrupt ending but then maybe they shouldn’t have picked this one for a movie adaptation.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Characters:<br />
I get the writers probably wanted Earwig to be a sassy, mischievous problem child but with a good heart, fighting back against mean adults however she honestly comes off as bratty and almost unintentionally sociopathic. She contently talks about how she got everyone in the orphanage do things the way she wants and how she plans to manipulate the witch and Mandrake into doing the same. This isn’t helped by how quickly she changes character beats. For all her whining about not wanting to be adopted the minute she is, she’s happy with it because she might be able to learn magic and use it to boss people around. Occasionally she mentions missing her old home but for the most part getting one up on The Witch is her driving motive and by the end of the film she basically gets exactly what she wants without learning anything from it.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the witch, there not much to her. Just an asshole adult figure for Earwig to feud against, repeating the same asshole adult figure statements like a broken record. The Mandrake isn’t much better but at least he has a cool design and sparkles.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Animation:<br />
Finally let’s talk about the infamous CGI. I don’t think the models look that bad. They’re a decent attempt at capturing Ghibli’s usual style in 3D but the major problem is that they lack the greater expression of Ghibli’s 2D work. The actual animation feels a little stiff in movement and lacking in expression although the few times that it does try to attempt wider more cartoony reactions, the results are greatly uncanny.<br />
<br />
In terms of setting, I hope you like the small cramp house The Witch lives in because pretty much the entire movie takes place in it, a far cry the sweeping grandeur of the bath house of Spirited Away or the oceans of Ponyo.<br />
<br />
I should also mention apparently to promote the film Goro was planning a puppet show at the Ghibli Museum. Yeah apparently Goro is an talented puppeteer and the director of the museum. The puppets look pretty cool, they’re still a little creepy but it feels like a more intentional Coraline kind of creepy. I dig it and kind of wish they went with puppets for the actually film.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
I guess every studio has at least one serious flop and that’s true of Ghibli as well. From the sloppy narrative to unlikable characters to mediocre animation, nothing seemed to work in the film on a fundamental level and it’s hard to see how such an acclaimed studio could have let it pass.<br />
<br />
I’m not blaming Goro Miyazaki though, chances are this was given a tiny budget and resources and thankfully Ghibli has confirmed that the movie was more of a one-off experiment with CGI as opposed to the new norm. I’m sure Miyazaki Senior is lurking the background, chuckling at his son’s recent flop; ready to skydive on to the silver screen and the melt audiences tits off with all the might of his glorious hand-drawn animation. A grim reminder that all anime was a mistake (expect his of course).

    I went into this movie knowing about the low reviews and went in with very low expectations. The least i can say is that im dumbfounded. I genuinely don&#039;t understand why people don&#039;t enjoy this film.<br />
Earwig is a wholesome and fun movie that, while being alot smaller scale with it world then other Ghibli movies, still has all of the charm that made me fall in love with Ghibli movies at  a young age. The whole film had me either laughing or awing as the character all have a strong dynamic that makes up the meat of the film. The film&#039;s plot is very

          <span style="display: none;" id="review379228">
        simple and digestible and i think it makes the film a candidate of being a good first Ghibli film for people who aren&#039;t familiar with them. <br />
The visuals of the film are also extremely charming. The settings and things like the food are near photo realistic, while the character models are cartoony and expressive. These two aesthetics together make the movie fell like dolls in in an elaborate doll house which works well with most of the movie taking place in a single home. I know people are giving this film a hard time for being a CG film but we should all know better by now that CG is capable of being just as charming and expressive as 2d and that&#039;s what this film is an example of. <br />

    A fun movie that unfortunately ends too soon. The story is straight forward and is mainly &quot;slice of life.&quot; Unfortunately, due to the length of the film, some plot points that are introduced aren&#039;t addressed which does feel incomplete but I didn&#039;t think it detracted from the rest of the movie. The cg is great, my only complaint is that the background was a little static near the beginning but everything else is good, especially all the jars and textures, you can tell alot of work was put into the film. I think the people that dislike it only think so because they&#039;re comparing it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review378155">
        to other ghibli movies, and I don&#039;t think comparison is a good way to rank things, but that&#039;s beside the point. If you want to watch something light and fun that doesn&#039;t take too much engagement, I&#039;d definitely recommend it, solid 7.5/10.

    Earwig and the Witch is a complete let-down of everything Ghibli ever stood for. While I admire the studio for dipping their toes into 3D animation and trying something new, their attempt completely falls flat.<br />
<br />
The animation feels weirdly rigid and unfinished. A lot of Ghibli&#039;s charm comes from its hand-painted environments and beautiful pastel colors, so a lot is lost when all you get is generic 3D environments. Don&#039;t get me wrong, 3D can be absolutely stunning - but something like Disney or Pixar has had the privilege of decades of experience and billions of dollars that Ghibli does not. It just does not suit

          <span style="display: none;" id="review399141">
        the movie at all, although the designs are a bit iconic and I LOVE curly-haired characters.<br />
<br />
Speaking of characters, I must say that I just absolutely despise Erica (Earwig). I don&#039;t mean to diminish the trauma and abuse that the poor girl goes through in the movie, but I disliked her from the very first time she speaks. She is just horribly mean to everyone around her and so manipulative that it&#039;s insane. It&#039;s not quirky or charming and reads like some sort of blossoming sociopath (I&#039;m not trying to be dramatic - she&#039;s just that awful). Her character&#039;s animation only exemplifies how annoying she is, especially with the awful tongue-sticking-out-oh-I&#039;m-so-innocent face she tries to pull. :P indeed.<br />
<br />
For the cover of the poster and the small bits that we got of the epic witch rock band, I really thought that music and sound would play a larger role! I&#039;m so used to the beautiful soundtracks in Ghibli films that this movie felt weirdly silent the whole way through and none of the rock music was utilized in a way that made any sense. I thought that Earwig would realize that she could unlock her magical abilities through music or something, but she never really sings or does anything musical at all. It&#039;s very strange.<br />
<br />
The ending of this movie was also exceptionally strange. Ghibli movies are often criticized for not having &quot;real conflicts,&quot; but I can usually pick out what the end goal of the protagonist is and try to guess what will happen. Ghibli conflicts may occasionally be low stakes, but there are stakes. For this movie, I could not figure out what Erica&#039;s goal was at all. It constantly shifted between wanting to leave, wanting to learn magic, and wanting everyone in the household to do what she wants. It became very confusing and in the last 20 minutes, I found myself wondering how on earth this could possibly end in a satisfying manner.<br />
<br />
I really wish that we could&#039;ve had more scenes with epic music numbers and witchy punk rockers, but all we got was an annoying little girl screaming the whole movie and being mean to the only two friends she had. I was really disappointed and bored throughout this movie, which made me sad. I really hope that Ghibli can find its footing again soon. I don&#039;t want them to stop pursuing 3D if it&#039;s something they&#039;re interested in, but I really hope that the story can be enough to help me overlook the somewhat mediocre-looking animation.

    As many other movies from Ghibli, Aya to Majo is also inspired in a story written by Diana Wynne Jones. And to better understand the problem with the story, the original author sadly died before being able to finish her book. So in a way this could be a tribute to her by the studio after how much she has given and inspired them in so many decades.<br />
<br />
People seems to be extremely harsh on the movie just because Ghibli&#039;s animation trademark has been left behind in this occassion, it doesn&#039;t mean that beautiful classic animation we all know and love will dissapear forever. Actually for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review378521">
        being their first 3DCG work it&#039;s completely astounding how brilliantly detailed everything is, so much that sometimes there are scenes could easily be mistaken for a real-life scenes; whether this is a good or a bad thing is for the viewer to judge on their own personal tastes, nevertheless, it&#039;s an incredible technical work of very high quality.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t believe the music can compete with wonderful  OSTs from Princess Monoke, Howl&#039;s Moving Castle, Castle in the Sky, My Neighbor Totoro, Porco Rosso, and many other classics, but it&#039;s very enjoyable.<br />
<br />
For the direction is not as bad as it may seem (Goro Miyazaki may not be his father, but he is overly critized just because he tries to propose something different and expand Studio Ghibli&#039;s views). We are talking about an unfinished story, so the movie just covers to that point. Of course characters and direction will feel bland because the original story is missing at the very least climax and dénouement, which make it feel like uncomplete or even question the point of choosing this story upon so many from Mrs. Jones (aganin the author); but then again it could be that Goro&#039;s intention was to tribute the author on her last unfinished work. <br />
<br />
There is not much more to say, just don&#039;t expect a new Spirited Away, a new My Neighbor Totoro or a new Howl&#039;s Moving Castle, just enjoy the movie for what it is. Even with all the flaws this movie has, and understanding that we are not watching a classic, it&#039;s worthy to be watched (specially since we are fed so much worse trash than this movie).

“It’s good that he made one movie. With that, he should stop&quot; - Hayao Miyazaki after watching Tales From Earthsea<br />
<br />
God, I wished Gorō had listened to his dear old dad. Why Gorō? Why do you insist on making it difficult for me to root for you? I want him to succeed and prove his father wrong but so far, as much as I hate to say this, he has been consistently failing to upheld his father&#039;s incredible legacy. With Earwig and the Witch, Studio Ghibli returns after a 6 year hiatus for a TV production and their latest offering turned out to achieve a new

          <span style="display: none;" id="review378352">
        cinematic low for the prestigious animation company that looks to rival both Gorō&#039;s own directorial debut and the last made for TV film that the staff at Ghibli worked on. <br />
<br />
The truth of the matter is if this movie was made by just another random studio, nobody would be talking about it as &quot;enthusiastically&quot; as they are. But it&#039;s not made by just another random animation studio. This is Studio Ghibli and just the thought that their fingerprints are plastered all over this movie just hurts my soul. I know this is technically a made for TV film but the movie makes it so hard to do so. The fact that we finally saw the lovable image of Totoro for the first time in front of a film after 6 long years and this forgetting dump of a film is what followed afterwards is downright upsetting. <br />
<br />
3D animation in general always gets a bad rep and most of the time, especially in anime, people just hate on it not because it&#039;s actually bad by any means but mainly because they had to resort to 3D or CGI in the first place(cough Attack on Titan: Final Season cough).The truth of the matter is the actual 3D animation isn&#039;t really all that bad as I thought it would be. But for the most part, every single character in this film exudes the same presence reminiscent to that of an ugly doll completely devoid of any life or some semblance of a soul or heart. <br />
<br />
I would also advice staying away from the dub for this movie. It&#039;s not because I am some sort of a sub elitist who believes that watching English Dub should constitute as a war crime nor is the actual dub bad by any means especially with the likes of Richard E. Grant and Dan Stevens part of the cast. In fact, it&#039;s quite solid and I would have enjoyed the dub even more if the dialogue actually tried to sync up with the lips of these characters half the time. The fact that it&#039;s 3D kind of makes it even more obvious. <br />
<br />
If there is one thing that I can always count on Gorō to nail, it&#039;s the music. It&#039;s the one constantly consistent factor prevalent throughout his films and Earwig is no different. The music possess a much more western aesthetic and works well for the most part. But even then that I would argue that I much prefer the soundtrack of his previous two films. I would also argue that the film concludes on a very abrupt note but frankly I just wanted it to be over and done with so I will take it as a blessing in disguise. <br />
<br />
As a whole, I wouldn&#039;t say Earwig and The Witch is a complete atrocity. It is certainly better than a lot of other films of it&#039;s kind but it still come across as nothing more a cheap excuse of a kids film. Even if you take away the Studio Ghibli logo, what you&#039;re still left with is a completely disposable animated film that will probably appeal only to its targeted demographic. And what made Ghibli films so appealing is its ability to allure both kids and the little child inside all of us with its gorgeous art and likeable characters. Earwig barely possess any of these factors and it&#039;s why I find it to be their worst film to date.

    Anyone below the age of 8 would enjoy this and give the movie probably 7.6/10<br />
<br />
This is a spoiler free review!<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
A girl gets adopted by a witch.....thats it really...<br />
There isn&#039;t really anything much happening in this movie. It is like watching someone&#039;s normal life. There are no risky plot decisions which is really a bad move imo because you will be very underwhelmed when you realize there is no major conflict.<br />
For a little kids, he/she will probably enjoy the protagonist&#039;s motives to make her adopted mom miserable and that is probably going to be the main enjoyment as well as the unknown character that appeared

          <span style="display: none;" id="review373718">
        at the beginning of the movie.<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
You wake up during school break. &quot;Yay PBS Kids is on!!&quot; You go on your couch and OHH SNAP! A movie special!!!<br />
Yeah this movie reminds me of PBS Kids A LOTTT!!! So kids won&#039;t really be complaining. Sometimes the visuals are very pleasing and is impressive for an anime 3d film. The best 3d anime film visually is probably the Lupin movie. <br />
The character&#039;s movements are very stiff and almost every scene you can explain how to make it better.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
K the music was pretty decent and is the best part of this film. The main song I enjoyed a lot and thats pretty much it.<br />
<br />
Character: 6<br />
The only interesting character is that one character who got about 45 seconds of screen time. <br />
The protagonist is a hit or miss<br />
The mother is a decent character but little kids won&#039;t like her much.<br />
The father is annoying imo and his personality is unneeded...<br />
Kids will enjoy the protagonist because the little girl in the movie and the kid watching the movie will have things in common.... KILL THE MOTHER!!!!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7<br />
I had very very very low expectations when watching this movie and it is a good thing I did. <br />
I somewhat enjoyed this movie. I would probably enjoy the movie more watching it with a younger sibling knowing that he or she will enjoy it a lot.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6<br />
The mean score of this review is a 6.8 but I am still going to give it a six because I am also rating it critically as well.<br />
Older audiences: Decent characters, most average story ever, good music, fine animation.<br />
Younger audiences: Fun characters, entertaining story but nothing deep, good music but I don&#039;t think they will care lol, normal animation

    I watched the Movie Today and I am a big fan when it comes to Studio Ghibli films. I&#039;ll Keep this review short. <br />
<br />
To start off, I&#039;ll head Fly Straight into the Characters and CG of the Film. The Background art is almost Disney/Pixar quality, it is very Beautiful and Stunning. The Lighting of the scenes is well done, and the Rain is great. Foliage is almost life like but still fits into the world with the Characters. Special Effects are almost Disney quality and are well done.<br />
<br />
I had a small gripe about Characters and how they looks and placed into the scenes... but that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review380249">
        grew on me. The character designs still have the Ghibli Charm. They may look flat at first glance, but to me they do not. <br />
The first thing you may notice is the hair which has a Plastic like Doll Appearance which IMO looks great. Then you notice the Eyes and Eyebrows, These are very expressive for a 3D Model and actually look nice. <br />
The Mouth is the only Issue on the Character Models, they just feel slow and look weird (This is more Apparent in the Dub where the VA/ADR don&#039;t do a good job with Lip Sync making you stare at their Mouths more).<br />
When you get to the Clothes these are standard with normal Textures so nothing special.<br />
<br />
Each Character has there own unique charm and are enjoyable to watch. The Mandrake the most Unique of the Characters has had extra care put into him, and is the character most people would like... i know right, the most scary one is the best one..<br />
<br />
For the Plot, I&#039;ll keep this short (Yeah like haven&#039;t done so far), It is Average, but Captivating, you don&#039;t want to look away. Almost every minute was good, some parts were Questionable, but the rest was fine. There isn&#039;t any plot holes... ok maybe one, but i wont talk about it because you will need to see it yourself. The Ending was a Cliffhanger like at the end of a Harem Anime... It is set up like there will be a sequel... but Ghibli doesn&#039;t do sequels and apparently the Book isn&#039;t finished because of the writer, So i have no clue what will happen. iIwant more... but probably won&#039;t get it.<br />
<br />
Overall Thoughts, It is an enjoyable film till the end with some issues in the CG but you get used to it quickly. The Plot can be better, but it is nowhere near bad, just wish it didn&#039;t have the Cliffhanger. The characters are loveable and the backdrops are beautiful. I definitely recommend this film, just don&#039;t set your expectations too high.

    Studio Ghibli’s latest movie experimented with CGI anime instead of the traditional hand-drawn method. Directed by Goro Miyazaki, and Hayao also played a part in planning this movie. <br />
<br />
The CGI was pretty good. However, I prefer the traditional hand-drawing more, as it felt more authentic and raw. This movie did not feel like a Studio Ghibli movie. Instead, it’s like watching an average American animation movie. <br />
<br />
Even more, the story was weird and a bit boring. This is the second Ghibli movie straight to TV, the first being Ocean Waves. The plot revolving around Earwig, who got adopted by a grumpy couple and was ordered

          <span style="display: none;" id="review397306">
        to work tirelessly. Because at the orphanage home she was the boss and manipulated people around her to obey her, now she wanted to manipulate this new couple also. It’s so weird that this was the message that the movie wanted to show audiences.<br />
<br />
Although there were some funny moments, there wasn’t much to the story. Most of the story was just Earwig being ordered around, and then the climax, if that’s even called a climax, happened. The story then abruptly ended. There were plot points that were basically ignored. <br />
<br />
Overall, problematic and short story that could be explored more. Maybe Ghibli should stick with the hand-drawn animation that made the studio famous. 4/10

If you go in expecting this movie to look like it’s from the early 2000’s, it’s enjoyable<br />
<br />
All I knew about this film was what I gathered from that god-awful trailer that premiered a few months ago. But that would not stop me from watching another film from Ghibli! <br />
<br />
Obviously the most jarring part of this film was the 3D animation. The original Ghibli style of simple characters does not translate well into CGI. Bella on the other hand translates the best due to her more cartoony features, easier to push her expressions. The characters in the orphanage looked pretty ghastly though, the weakest designs. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420941">
        designs were basically not a style, it mostly reminded me of The Polar Express, slightly hitting that uncanny valley. The backgrounds and sets were okay, sometimes the exterior of a building or a floor looked more polished than the entire scene. This film lacked texture, from hair, to clothes, to background, it all felt like plastic. <br />
Of all the things visually, I could get past those. What I could not get used to was the voice acting versus the faces, expressions, and phonemes(mouth movements for pronunciation), since they didn’t match a good part of the time. How did they mess that up when it’s all recorded beforehand and then animated to?<br />
<br />
Despite all of the visuals, I thought the story was simple but effective. Straightforward, you can pretty much guess what will happen. But I found the individual details and interactions to be more interesting cumulatively. This movie was quite simple, and is definitely meant for a younger audience. I personally thought the opening and ending credits were stronger than the rest of the movie. There are a few fun parallels and references to other Ghibli movies that I found interesting.  Mandrake drew so many parallels to Coraline’s (American stop-motion film from Laika) other father, it felt a little like a rip off in ways. Tall and lanky, glasses, writes, down a circular passageway, I could go on!<br />
<br />
Goro has definitely not made too many masterpieces, the only other movie that I thought was noteworthy was From up on Poppy Hill, but this one felt like he genuinely took his own direction for the first time. Though that might indicate he could perform better telling different types of stories through a different media at a different studio.<br />
<br />
I can say that I enjoyed this a lot more than I expected to. Will I watch it again? Probably not for a very long time if again, but definitely way better than it was made out to be.<br />

    This is my first time writing a review and I felt compelled too because this movie baffled me. I also looked up some info and want to explain a bit. <br />
<br />
This film is based on the children&#039;s novel Earwig and the Witch, but sadly author Diana Wynne Jones passed away and this novel was released posthumously. It seems Studio Ghibli chose not to edit too much of the source material and as a result this novel and movie give the sense of an abrupt ending and personally no real substance. <br />
<br />
Art: 6 <br />
<br />
I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the CG was and how beautiful

          <span style="display: none;" id="review373726">
        the scenes were. I did get a sense that this was indeed a Ghibli film. <br />
<br />
Sound: 6 <br />
<br />
I liked the sound and the use of the music in this film as a vehicle for the plot. <br />
<br />
Character: 3 <br />
<br />
There is barely any character development and I felt it was severely lacking.<br />
<br />
Story: 2 <br />
<br />
There is hardly any story here. As soon as the movie feels like it is getting to the story it abruptly ends. No explanation. I found myself checking to make sure I had actually reached the end. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 4 <br />
<br />
The end really spoiled the mood for me on this film. <br />
<br />
Overall: 4<br />
<br />
This movie in hindsight was just completely bland. It was devoid of any meaningful plot and I did not connect with the characters or the setting as a result.

    It&#039;s a cute film, but unfortunately the ending feels incomplete.<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed the art and the texture of the character CGI, but overall the backgrounds felt dark and flat. The character work was one of the best parts of this movie, and this fun clay style along with the great voice acting really made the characters charming. (I watched in Japanese but I&#039;m sure the dub is good too).<br />
<br />
The story was the most lacking part of this.The different threads just didn&#039;t really come together. While most Ghibli films tend to wander, they have a strong trough line that connect back to the emotions of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review379936">
        characters and their internal growth. That was lacking in this story. The characters themselves are colorful and charming enough, but they don&#039;t quite make up for the lack of structure in the story. I like the sentiment of the ending, but we don&#039;t see enough of Earwig growing into her family to really see and understand that they have come to care for one another.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a fun kids movie, and while it might not compare to Miyazaki, it&#039;s not, in my opinion, the worst movie the studio has put out.

    The ending is nonsense.<br />
I can understand why they can&#039;t intervene in the original story, but...<br />
I don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair to treat the viewers who have been watching it for 80 minutes like this.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll say this so that there are no misunderstandings, but the story is interesting.<br />
The story is interesting, but it has become the enemy of this work.<br />
If there was no original story, it would have been better to incorporate some original elements.<br />
I used to think that Ghibli was a group of people who were willing to adapt original works in order to create their works, but I was wrong. I guess that was only

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414562">
        possible because of the skills of directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata.<br />
<br />
As for the voice actors (Japanese version), they have been using amateurs for a long time now, so I can pass over them even though I think they are terrible.<br />
As for the visuals, the animation was disappointing to the extent that it is sad to be called Ghibli.<br />
<br />
I couldn&#039;t feel any passion for animation production in this film.<br />
Now it&#039;s just a weak film borrowing the name of a famous artist.<br />
I hope there is salvation in this film.<br />
<br />
In case you were wondering<br />
Since it&#039;s produced by NHK, the chances of it being low budget are slim to none!<br />
<br />
<br />
終わり方がナンセンス。<br />
昨今のアニメ事情を見ると、原作に介入できない事情も分かるけども…<br />
80分観てきた視聴者に対してこの仕打ちはあんまりだよ。<br />
<br />
誤解が無いように言っておくけど、物語は面白い。<br />
だが、今作はその面白さが仇になってしまった。<br />
原作が無いのであれば、ある程度はオリジナル要素を取り込んでも良かったのではないか。<br />
ジブリは作品作りの為ならば原作の改編も厭わない集団だと思っていたが、それは間違った解釈だった。それは宮崎駿監督や高畑勲監督の手腕があったからこそ実現していたということか。<br />
<br />
声優(日本版)は今まで散々素人の起用をしてきたので、ひどいなと思いつつもスルー出来るのだが、<br />
映像に関しては、ジブリという冠がつくのが悲しいレベルの残念なアニメーションだった。<br />
<br />
この作品からはアニメ制作にかける情熱が全く感じられないのだ。<br />
今は有名なアーティストの名を借りているだけの脱力した映画にすぎない。<br />
この映画に救いがあるといいな。<br />
<br />
因みに<br />
製作がNHKなので、低予算である可能性は限りなく薄いぞ！

    I know everyone was complaining about the CGI when they first saw what this film looked like, but that ended up actually being one of its strong points. Considering the movie was made for TV, it had pretty good animation. Not Pixar quality or Lupin III: The First quality, but far better than CGI is most anime (and probably many western tv shows too). It can feel uncanny at times, but it isn’t enough to keep you from understand what is happening. The film is enjoyable to watch but the major problem with it is that it hardly has a plot at all. There’s nothing

        wrong with slice-of-life stories, but this film felt like it was setting you up for something that it never delivered on. There were things that could have been expanded on to create an engaging plot, but instead it felt like the entire movie was just Act 1, the buildup to the action that would never come.
