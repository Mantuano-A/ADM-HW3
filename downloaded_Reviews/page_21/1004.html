    I was unsure, unsure of watching this. I thought it would be so generic and unfunny to roll my eyes. I thought that I&#039;d hate the show and its characters. I thought if I start watching the anime I would have dropped it within the first 5 minutes. I thought of all this and decided to skip it. I decited to not watch it, and I ignored it. I ignored all the memes people were making of the show. I ignored all the videos on Youtube and all the possible outcomes to getting a single picture of the show in front of me. I indeed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331181">
        thought and did all of this.<br />
<br />
That was my biggest mistake ever. That was something I should have never done to myself. The cover certainly didn&#039;t help. The plot either. I hadn&#039;t read the manga the anime was based off. I never heard someone talk about this serie before. For a moment I thought that Satan himself brought it to me as a kind of torture. But instead it t was Jesus who gave it to Santa Claus to give it to me. It was an early present, and what a present that was. A masterpiece of an anime. Oh yeah, the best gift imaginable.<br />
<br />
Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun is by far the most surprising anime I&#039;ve seen in recent years. No one, with a good understanding of anime would have though that this anime would have been this good. Most of the &quot;elite&quot; people would have gone with the typical answer of &quot;Ah yeah, it seems like another of those generic isekais that we&#039;re forced to endure until the end of time&quot;. Which, they&#039;re Certainly not wrong. As most viewers would do upon watching an anime is looking at the cover and considering this anime as a cover has certainly turned off a lot of viewers on ignoring it (as of myself) because of the genericness the show has (It certainly does have it, to some extent, tho). However, sometimes in order to know the liking of something you have to go balls deep. Sometimes you have to even force yourself into watching something as the final result might actually surprise you. It&#039;s not recommendable but sometimes efficient.<br />
<br />
In my case, it didn&#039;t just surprise me as a whole but since the beginning I loved it. I loved every second of it. I loved the environment which resembles a lot to Soul Eater. I loved the characters and their design. I loved the premise. I loved the humor. I loved everything the show had to offer. The main character while not relatable to me I could see why he would be one of the greatest isekai protagonist out there. His charisma and his timing for a funny face of his is something I truly liked. It&#039;s funny. While sometimes some clichès can ruin a joke I was relieved that the amount of clichès here found didn&#039;t had any effect on them. It was as if they were telling two different jokes and I laughed at both. That kind of thing. The characters are also likable. Very much so. They even tend to overshadow the main character at times on how great they are. Their personalities definitely helps and that&#039;s the best part of the show. Their personalities. I keep repeating this but I can&#039;t help it on how great their personalities are. They&#039;re fun on screen and whatever happens be it good or not they&#039;re hilarious at any given time.<br />
<br />
With that said, there&#039;s one thing that I have a complaint with and that is the amount of characters the show has. Because most of the time the story is set at school it leads no time for any character devolvement. There&#039;s some but it&#039;s not in a gran scale, but then again it&#039;s not it has a crazy amount of episodes to accomplish that task. Many of them are fodder, so I guess it doesn&#039;t matter.<br />
<br />
As for the technical sound of the show, I&#039;d say if the second best thing about the show. Especially the opening. The opening has been a blast and it&#039;s in English. We usually don&#039;t get too many openings on that language so it&#039;s a nice touch, i&#039;d add. Also, there weren&#039;t too many OSTs throughout the show. It would have been greater if there&#039;d been variety of it. Nonetheless, for what we&#039;ve gotten, it was awesome.<br />
<br />
As I previously said, I loved watching this anime. While it didn&#039;t bring anything new to the table I still think it&#039;s a fresh air of the usual isekai we get, don&#039;t you think? It&#039;s actually hilarious of an anime and I would recommend to anybody. Ah yeah... I forgot to add. Best female of the show is Amelie. Liked her personality and the design looks so damn good. Definitely waifu material.<br />
<br />
I had fun watching this, and I hope you did too.

Sometimes we are tempted to exaggerate about a series. Mairimashita! Iruma-kun will give us that opportunity, but in the end, the series can be considered average. From some perspective, the series is for a demographic group, children, if we look at the character designs, the licensors, the plot all points to that. Despite all those facts, the series can be enjoyable for any group of age. I think that the series succeeded in the comedy execution, it is not the best, but it can bring a smile into our faces. <br />
<br />
The story follows a youngster, Iruma, who is sold by his parents to the demon

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331210">
        Sullivan. This demon takes him to the underworld and starts raising him as his grandson. As the plot advances, we follow Iruma’s daily routine and how he needs to find a way to survive in a world that “hates” the humans. Ironically as it seems, he enjoys more the demon world that humans, so this helps the plot and the character’s growth. However, not all is poetry. The show follows the typical iseaki rules. A guy goes to another world and is powerful. Is it the case of Iruma? Yes, it is. This kid can stand face to face against the fiercest demons from his school, and the only explanation given to us is, he suffered too much in the real world, or he received some sort of ring, that is childish but since it is a comedy we do not care too much about that.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the characters are enjoyable. There is a vast cast. It is necessary since the author needs to emulate a daily school routine. Without a big cast, the show will become the typical school anime with a small bunch of characters doing the same thing. Season example, Koisuru Asteroid. Also, I do not want to criticize, but it seems that almost all the spectators watched this show only for Ameri. Although she was a good and strong character if a different person than Saori voiced her, I bet that none would be saying the same. The main character, Iruma, is delightful. From a coward human, he ends as another “demon” that cares about his friends and his surroundings; he tries very hard to not been noticed, but he takes several risks for his new life, and all those risks lead us to some comedic and hilarious moments.<br />
<br />
Asmodeus, he is talented and maybe the strongest demon in the school. He changes and becomes a great friend and Iruma’s support. In the beginning, you can see him as the typical school rival, but you will be glad that he changes and he is Iruma’s friendship anchor.<br />
<br />
Clara, she maybe is the craziest demon around, her personality is very charming and cute. She is a delightful character that will make us smile with her craziness. <br />
<br />
Ameri, she has a good personality, is reliable, is charming, and is a very dedicated demon, but her most significant development will appear in the second season. The best will come. <br />
<br />
The art and the animation, the show has an acceptable animation. Do not misunderstand, but the palette and the design are childish. Makoto’s direction forced to use a bright and colorful palette to remove the dark and fearful demon’s traits. It is a widespread move when a director wants to deliver a show to kids, and that is reflected in the series’ actual ranking (1345) and the broadcasting time. The sound and the VO are acceptable and the voice fits the character’s personalities in most of the cases. <br />
<br />
Finally, the show will make you laugh and have some hilarious moments. But here is the problem, you will laugh the first time, the second time maybe not (if there is a second time). As a friend said to me, the second time, you can consider the jokes average and weak. Mairimashita! Iruma-kun is a good series to spend your time, but I am sure you are not going to rewatch it, so that means that even if you liked and love it, the show does not deserve a score more than 7.0.<br />

    Mairimashita! Iruma-kun is a very charming anime. It is the kind of anime you start watching to feel relaxed and before you know it, you are invested in it so much you can&#039;t wait the week before the next episode comes out. It is that type of anime and I&#039;m so glad I didn&#039;t miss out on it. <br />
<br />
The plot is very easy to understand, it is about a boy who was sold to a devil by his parents and he has to try his best to hide that he is a human while going to a devil school. One of the things I liked

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331197">
        about this plot is that Iruma wasn&#039;t made to be a sad existance. In fact, him being in that position made him earn lots of knowledge, skills and a mindset that helped him in his new life. <br />
<br />
What I really liked the most about this anime were the characters. I liked the main cast so much and how they were written. Almost every other side character had his charm and characterstics that made him stand out but not to the extent where they over-shadowed the main characters. The best character imo is Iruma who was a very good character and a very rare one to find. <br />
<br />
Iruma is the type of character that makes you just want to see him happy. You get the same feeling when watching Natsume Yuujinchou where you just want nothing bad to happen to the character and only wish the best for them. I rarely get this invested in a main character but I really liked how Iruma was written and I would love to see more characters like that. <br />
<br />
I think the characters are the reason I highly enjoyed this anime as they were just very good to watch. Their interactions, personalities and overall atmosphere they gave out was great and how they all developed together was very fun to watch. <br />
<br />
The comedy in the anime is very nice. Of course not on the Gintama/Danshi Kousei level but still decent enough to make me smile a lot. <br />
<br />
There is little romance which is something I was glad to see. I hate how almost every SOL anime now is focused a lot on it. <br />
<br />
The art, sound and animation are fantastic. I loved the voice actors so much in the anime as they seem very fitting unlike some other anime that were made this season.<br />
<br />
Overall I would give Iruma a 9/10. I really enjoyed it from episode 1 to 23 and I hope to see a sequel/more anime anytime soon with the same quality (if not better) as this one. <br />
<br />
Would recommend it to anyone wanting to watch a relaxing show with great characters.

    This anime is honestly hilarious to watch. It&#039;s been quite a while since there was an anime I have enjoyed watching to this extent.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story 8/10:<br />
The story is definitely a unique one (to me anyways), an high school student Iruma gets sold to a demon by his bitch parents. But instead of eating him like normal demons would, the demon he got sold to instead decides to make Iruma his grandson and send him to demon school as an honor student. Only problem is that not every demon is as nice as his new granddad meaning that he has to keep him being a human a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321391">
        secret or risk getting eaten. This makes for a lot of funny moments as he is trying to cover up his secret all while trying to have fun at his new school.<br />
<br />
Art 9/10:<br />
The art for this anime can be described through one world - Beautiful. The art and animation in this show are some of the best I&#039;ve seen in a while. All the animations are spot on with the backgrounds having great attention to detail as well as fitting into the feel of the anime extremely well. On top of all that the show is filled to the brim with bright colors which really help set the scene as well as show that this isn&#039;t some horror show with demons ans is instead a fun comedy. Without a doubt one of the better animated shows this season.<br />
<br />
Sound 7/10:<br />
I can say without a doubt that the music in the show are very well done. Both the OP and ED fit very well with the anime both in terms of the atmosphere and in terms of the premise of the show. The music and sound all sound soft and full of energy which definitely reflects the mood well.<br />
<br />
Characters 10/10:<br />
Wow. The characters are were this anime really hits it out of the park. Every demon that has been shown look incredibly detailed, you can tell the amount of detail in this show just by looking at how good the characters look. Every character has a different design with no two looking the same and most looking completely different. In addition all the characters have a distinct personality which differs from any other character. Even the side characters that only appear for gags seem realistic as they have great personality.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9/10:<br />
Like I said at the beginning this show is hilarious and makes me laugh every episode. It is clearly one of the best shows to come out this season and It makes me want to keep on watching it. I find myself constantly waiting for the next episode to come out, I haven&#039;t seen an anime that has me hooked to this extent in a while. Every episode leaves a huge smile on my face.<br />
<br />
Overall 9/10:<br />
This anime is a must watch for almost everyone. If you like comedy mixed with demons and magic definitely give this one a shot.

    &quot;School is a place to learn.&quot;<br />
<br />
That’s what some of my parents and teachers used to tell me back when I was a kid. Marimashita Iruma-kun! takes the school life tropes by bringing in demons and supernatural entities to spice things up. Because in this demonic world, anything is possible when protagonist Iruma Suzuki enters a demon school.<br />
<br />
From Bandai Namco Pictures, Marimashita Iruma-kun walks along the line of a colorful scheme. By focusing on a protagonist of innocent and kind nature, you can probably expect a host of misadventures aimed at his way. Iruma’s life is changed forever upon being sent to a school full of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331180">
        demons. The catch is that no one really knows his true nature, that being a human. Without guidance and being alone in such a world, this anime leads an adventure that blends many genres together into one colorful package.<br />
<br />
Watching the first few episodes gave me a bold impression, one which I assume the author wanted to make the audience laugh. Make no mistake. As bizarre as the synopsis sounds, the show itself is rather lighthearted that’s drenched with comedy. I’m talking about lighthearted comedy of character humor and jokes poking at the fun of being the only human in a demon school. Iruma is practically the new kid in the neighborhood and he must adapt his ways to survive and live his new life. Luckily, he is a gentle boy who seems to be able to easily make friends with just about anyone. There’s even jokes throughout the series where he never refuses favors, regardless how ridiculous they seem. This type of ‘nice guy’ can be irritating to watch at first but Iruma sells his personality exquisitely through the character relationships he builds with others.<br />
<br />
I practically lost count how many friends Iruma made by the time this anime concluded. Running at a pace of 23-episodes, each one brings out more and more of his personality to fruition. From the very beginning, Iruma has an unnatural ability to change others. An early example is when he makes friends with Asmodeus Alice, an egoistic man who he managed to defeat in a duel. Since that defeat, the two have become close allies and friends together. Another close friend he makes is Clara, the green haired demon girl with a bubbly personality and essentially an airhead. Watching their relationship grow is strange to say the least but deep down, the two forms a friendship that is a national treasure. Even someone as intimidating as Azazel Ameri joins his circle of close friends. What initially started out an embarrassing misunderstanding turns into a bond built on trust. Whenever Ameri is around Iruma, her serious nature fades away and she becomes more of an innocent schoolgirl. The anime also makes jokes about her love for shoujo manga and the delusions she comes to believe based on its romance stories. The big picture here is that Iruma’s personality stands as a symbol of purity. When we hear the word ‘demons’ we tend to think of words such as “evil”. But here, we meet a sweet gentle boy who lives a life to help others while trying to hide his human nature.<br />
<br />
Based on the manga, I knew this show wouldn’t have enough material to cover everything. But luckily, anime viewers can easily absorb what the author is selling to us with their colorful ideas. Adaptation wise, the anime doesn’t exclusively follow chapters by chronological order but instead structures every episode together to make the overall series flow. This ranges from Iruma building relationships with the main cast, his daily misadventures, and sometimes, the crazy amount of humor. There are minor details changed in the anime such as certain characters introduced earlier or additional scenes added in later episodes. A goal I noticed the anime in trying to achieve is getting the audience engaged with the storytelling. When there are episodes about school events, it tries to flesh out the comedy as much as possible. Other times, it emphasizes on how Iruma interacts despite being so different majority of the cast. It’s also safe to say that some girls in the show (namely Ameri) may have grown a crush on the boy. The anime doesn’t follow a forbidden romance route but it’s always fun to tease his relationships with the female cast. Besides that, the numerous amounts of comedy gags and demonic references (like the Number of the Beast, 666) is evident throughout the show. They’re almost like Easter Eggs thrown in to make the audience more aware about the show’s overall appeal.<br />
<br />
Bandai Namco Pictures previously worked on the Gintama anime franchise and they bring in their talent to this humorous supernatural comedy. Every episode contains elements of humorous choreography whether it’s the character chemistry, school gags, or other shenanigans. The anime also retains the style of the manga, something that I applaud the studio for making it true as possible. Character designs has a cartoony look that sometimes can make the audience forget they are non-humans. Of course, that doesn’t apply to the case of Iruma, as he looks like an innocent school boy. Meanwhile, the character expressions sometimes jump over the board that is nothing short of classic comedy. Don’t believe me? Just watching Ameri’s first meeting with Iruma and you can see why. It’s just one example but this show is no short on fuse with its humor, enhanced by the cartoony art style of overall gimmicky display of character personalities.<br />
<br />
Marimashita! Iruma-kun is what I describe as a testament of comedy national treasure. Often times, supernatural comedies can feel too scripted or out of touch by its dialogues. However, this show manages to connect all its dots right with a lovable character cast and lighthearted story adventure. Iruma may be a human but he accomplished a lot more than what demons can at their school. And with all that being said, I welcome you to join in the fun with more to come next year in Season 2.

    This review was written after episode 12. These are just my intial thoughts. This review is for the most part spoiler free.<br />
<br />
Demons, love them or hate them this new slice of life is sure to crack you up. The plot revolves around Suzuki Iruma a human sold off by his parents to a demon, this demon is a sweet and loving person enrolling Iruma into Demon School to of course, become a demon! As a slice of life it follows Iruma in his daily like meeting new demons while keeping his true Human identity secret. <br />
<br />
Story:5/10<br />
As said earliar Marimashita! Iruma-kun is a basic comedy slice

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324613">
        of life, however its main twist being that the setting is a Demon School. The Directors did an incredible job changing the formula with this one, in this Anime basic tasks are done with magic and at this school students learn how to be true devils. This can range from how to suduce men, summoning &quot;familiars&quot;, and more. Things considered to be normal here always have a strange twists in the demon world, for example dodgeball can be played using super powers. Aside from that being totally epic it adds another layer of depth really selling you on this Demon World Iruma finds himself in.<br />
<br />
Iruma however being human, changes the way he goes through his school life. Being a human totally changes the rules of the world for him, instead of summoning a familiar(a guiding spirit) he spawns a fellow demon that happens to be his sensei, he does not have any magic, and he can&#039;t be measured on the demon scale. His classmates not knowing this consider him incredible, amazing, a god even. This relationship between him and his classmates is very endearing and funny at points. However, nothing really happens. I get it it&#039;s a slice of life comedy but most jokes never hit the mark, there is no incredible moments, and after the episode it all just feels dull. Its an anime you can kind of just move on from. It also hurts how they never really change up the formula, it was fun at first but it gets really boring. At some point you gotta spice it up, and up till this point nothing really stuck with me.<br />
<br />
Art:8/10<br />
The art style in my opinion is very unique, when I see a post on instagram of a charcter from this show for example. Even if I don&#039;t know their exact name, I can still tell they&#039;re from this show. Settings and new locations feel perfect in contrast with the charcters and emotions are displayed perfectly, this is all your animation needs to be. But good art does not warrant a 10/10, there are some &quot;weak&quot; so to speak scenes that are hardly noticable but they are still there. If you are gonna get a 10/10 from me you have to go above and beyond, you shouldn&#039;t just meet the standard.<br />
<br />
Sound:4/10<br />
There was nothing of note in the soundtrack, in fact I didn&#039;t like it either. The Op is obnoxious and I skipped it every single time, it dosen&#039;t help that the ed was quite generic as well even though it was a little bit better. On the other side of the spectrum voice acting was quite nice, line delivery was convincing and it perfectly matched the tone of the scene. However there hasn&#039;t been any line delivery that has really sold me on the voice acting yet.<br />
<br />
Characters:6/10<br />
All characters in this show all feel one note, aside from the small few who get development all characters feel extremly basic and cliche. Asmodeus is that classic proud butler type who follows around the main charcter celebrating everything he does. Clara is quite pathetic with her not even realizing that she was so obviously being taken advantage of needing to be saved by Iruma. Iruma is the classic dense, average student we are suppose to relate with. The student president Azazel is that cool on the outside sweet and stupid on the inside type character. And the rest of the cast are all forgettable nobodys, in the end the charcters all feel like they&#039;re &quot;seasonal&quot; if you know what I&#039;m getting at.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:5/10<br />
Enjoyment was probally the killer of this anime with it going down overtime. If you asked me after I watched the first 5 episodes how I would rate this anime, honestly I would have probally given it an 8. At first everything felt fresh and new, now 7 weeks later it feels boring and cliche. If it were me I would have made this a single core series (12 eps long) and ended things off with some closure or a cliff hanger. As the series goes on I will probally lower this score if it stays the same, or increase it if they spice it up. <br />
<br />
Overall:6/10<br />
Ima be totally honest, I wrote this review because I thought the other reveiws were just to short too justify there high scores. In the end I hope I gave you an unbiassed opinion from someone who rates anime fairly. This anime does not have staying power and in 12 weeks I doubt anybody will be talking about it, with that said and done see you all around and I&#039;m sorry if there were any spelling or grammar mistakes. Was kinda just rushing to finish Lmao<br />

    Marimashita! Iruma-Kun started as a welcome breath of fresh air; the plot, the character designs, the comedic timing, the backgrounds and even the OP looked like taken straight out of a forgotten shounen school comedy from 2002. Like those early noughts series, Marimashita! Iruma-Kun is based on a simple long running gag: Suzuki Iruma is our MC, a human without any sort of magical power who attends a demon school and the only thing he wants is to avoid danger by not standing out. Everything he does to keep his peaceful school life and annonymacy backfires and by the end of every story arc, Iruma

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331213">
        ends up being more and more admired by his peers.<br />
<br />
It was a fun show that, I thought, would stay afloat if it didn’t (a) become to repetitive and (b) try to take itself too seriously.<br />
<br />
Sadly, it accomplished neither of those things.<br />
<br />
Iruma, the character, too often falls into the “Idiot Houdini” archetype, the “good natured but untalented MC who climbs his way to the top despite lacking any sort of talent, thanks to Deus ex Machina”. That type of character generally walks the thin line between endearing (Forrest Gump) and irritating (Jar Jar Binks) and the plot of Marimashita! Iruma-Kun walks the same fine line: at first the show is dumb but endearing, but as Iruma stumbles his way to an unwanted and undeserved success over and over again it becomes tremendously irritating to watch.<br />
<br />
However, if there’s anything more undeserved and unneeded in Marimashita! Iruma-Kun it’s the length of the show. This didn’t deserve nor did it need twenty three episodes to tell the story and like most assets in life who are both undeserved an unneeded, they ended up being thoroughly wasted.<br />
<br />
It’s no wonder then that the pacing in this show is horrendously inconsistent. Things move at a good speed for the first half of the show until it hits a tedious wall known as “the Batora/School festival arc” which simply goes on for too damn long until by the end of it, it’s hard to care anymore about what’s happening with the arc and what will happen to the show moving forward. If you felt that the best thing that could happen to the show was Kirio blowing up the entire school, trust me, you are not alone.<br />
<br />
The biggest attractive to Marimashita Iruma-Kun it’s the colorful, interesting cast of side characters who range from trope-defying to functional to the story. Asmodeus is the perfect complementary sidekick to Iruma, his general story arc (a powerful demon who is destined to do great things but prefers to take a secondary role and support someone who he deems more powerful) is perfectly symmetric to Iruma’s arc (a demon with absolutely no power who would prefer to stay low-key but is pushed to the forefront at every single chance). Clara is a complete energy ball who continuously generates laughs which are never at her expense. Amerie is an decently written love interest, a strong female character revered by his peers for her power and demeanor without a single trace of the tropes and fanservice that at times plagues the shounen demographic. Sullivan and Callego-sensei both play their roles to perfection and add laughs to the story and the story even nails the comedic timing with some tertiary characters like Sabnock and Kamui.<br />
<br />
Sadly most of these characters take a back seat by the second half of the show which seems to focus on annoying secondary characters turned antagonists (Kirio) and probably the weakest character of the show: Iruma.<br />
<br />
Overall, Marimashita! Iruma-Kun was a show that had good, fun, lighthearted moments but proved to be too repetitive, long, inconsistent and filled with bad decisions in terms of storyline to be able to fulfill its potential.<br />

    “Imagine making an anime which is essentially a rip-off of Hotel Transylvania with a protagonist which is fundamentally a rip-off of Deku, the most retarded-looking protagonist in it. Tagged as Shounen as well? Pfft. This might possibly be worse than My Hero Academia.” - that’s what I thought before watching the show. <br />
<br />
Before I began watching Mairimashita! Iruma-kun, I was a big hypocrite towards the show. Trying to judge and criticize it in every way by simply perceiving it and not actually try it myself. When I gathered my courage and began the show it felt like opening a present box given by the people

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345577">
        who I love. It was bursting with many sentiments that allowed me to stay happy. I laughed, laughed and laughed. I haven’t laughed this hard ever since a long time now. All the shows I’ve seen in the past mainly consist of sadness and sorrow. I’ve seen so much of those I’ve forgotten about the joy of watching a generic, happy and peaceful anime like this. <br />
<br />
The Opening song is very catchy and good. The story has a relaxing pace to it and it&#039;s quite entertaining and interesting. The plots aren’t super thrilling yet I just couldn’t wait for it to unleash. The characters are likable and they have many unexpected, unique traits and features. The art style and quality is also very good as well.<br />
<br />
Mairimashita! Iruma-kun is a hidden masterpiece. It helped me find the happiness I lost. I’m so glad I watched this show, and I don’t regret starting it a single bit. <br />
<br />
This is recommended to everybody. Yes, you as well. Criticizers. This is actually good I’m telling you. If you haven’t seen this then you’re missing out big time.

    Well the synopsis of this anime promised. A boy named Suzuki Iruma is sold by his parents to a demon. Then everything becomes cliche. <br />
<br />
The protagonist easily forgets his parents. He is sent to a demonic school where the song itself is supposed to be eating humans. One could be fascinated by how the activities in the demon world will be and how he will survive so that no one discovers that he is human, but what takes away his grace is that they do the same as all humans. <br />
<br />
All difficulties are solved with the power of your benefactor. The story behind never progresses.

        It is a pink world, coffee shops, where you have to go to classes, make friends and do physical activity. Iruma is literally made to play dodgeball like another high school boy in a chapter. Even later they will watch an entire chapter of demonic idols. All the characters are generic, none stand out and they even become too childish to be a demonic world. Where is the survival then? There is not. It is a school like any other.<br />
<br />
24 chapters too long for what they count. And I have no doubt that there are many better schools to visit in anime.

    Isekai is one of the largest genres of anime and it continues to grow every season. with every season of anime, there is a new lot of trashy and generic iseakai to sift through. This show contains many of the general isekai tropes, but it changes the formula just enough to keep the watcher engaged and differentiate itself.  The show is generally quite enjoyable and comedic but you will find nothing groundbreaking here so keep your expectations low. I would say for most anime fans it&#039;s worth a watch, but for trashy isekai fans (You know who you are)  its a must-watch.

    This is a cliche story about a dumb but kind boy who got lucky and got transported into another world. Girls fall for him, boys serve or lose to him, all thanks to his luck or third-party&#039;s help. The protagonist does not have his own will, he just smiles to everybody.<br />
<br />
Jokes are not fun and repetitive.<br />
<br />
There is nothing that could be considered a plot (a side-story starts at episode 14 and it has a kind of childish &quot;mystery&quot; that you see through from the first moments).<br />
<br />
Pathetic.<br />
<br />
I doubt that I would enjoy this story even when I was 13 yo.<br />
<br />
If you want to enjoy a similar

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331352">
        story with demon school, but done well, I would recommend taking a peek at Rosario + Vampire MANGA. Anime was trashed by fan-service and low quality overall, manga is the best.

    Every now and again a show comes along that seems interesting, but you&#039;re not quite sure if you want to get into it. Sometimes you take a leap of faith and it results in you wasting your time. Other times, it ends up being a hidden gem and you thank your lucky stars you got to try it.<br />
<br />
For me, Iruma-Kun was the latter. Iruma- Kun is an isekai, but it&#039;s not your typical otaku escapism bait. It&#039;s much closer to the feeling of watching Cartoon Network shows as a kid than it is to watching a Log Horizon or Re:Zero.<br />
<br />
 I was put onto the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331190">
        show by some friends in anime club during the start of the Fall season and decided to give it a try once I got home. The show started off quite slow for me. In fact, I would even say I was pretty bored for the first two episodes. But once episode 3 came around and we were introduced to some of the side characters who go onto become very prominent in the latter stages of the series, I was hooked.<br />
<br />
The show is essentially about a boy who gets kidnapped from his home by a demon and brought to the underworld to act as the demon&#039;s grandson. His &quot;grandfather&quot; enrols him in a Demon Academy in which he goes on to become sort of a legend. The gig of the show is that Iruma, as a human, does not belong in the underworld and if ever discovered he would be killed/eaten/imprisoned. Yet, somehow he manages to maintain an air of secrecy about his identity and rises up the ranks of the school to become one of the most respected students.<br />
<br />
While the latter half of the show features a fair bit of drama/tension, it&#039;s overwhemhimgy a very relaxing comedy with focus on character interactions and bonds. As I said earlier, it&#039;s much more closely related to those old cartoons you used to watch on Cartoon Network after school than it is to other isekai and that really adds to the freshness of the series. If you&#039;re apprehensive about watching isekai or about this show, I can assure you, give it a try and you will not regret it.<br />
<br />
The animation and art are very well done by Bandai and the textures/shades of the background and character designs are excellent. There&#039;s no real sakuga scenes in the show as that&#039;s not the focus of it, but everything is more than good enough for this type of show.<br />
<br />
As I said before, the characters make this show. All of them feel unique and fun. The comedy is very well done as well. I guarantee you&#039;ll be laughing out loud constantly throughout the run of the show.<br />
<br />
In conclusion(TL:DR) Iruma-Kun is a very fun and fresh take on isekai and will provide you with hours of entertainment. It&#039;s very under appreciated and slept on, but it&#039;s a hidden gem. Watch this show and thank me later.<br />

    Let&#039;s rewind back to the golden era of western cartoons, the 2000s. You had a bunch of fun, creative and clever cartoons that were filled with heart and passion. Some of my favorite cartoons growing include Ben 10 as well its sequel Alien Force Phineas and Ferb, Kim Impossible, The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, Codename Kids Next Door and Teen Titans.<br />
Too bad that western cartoon has become a cesspool of shit in recent years. Sure I heard there were a couple of decent to good cartoon series to come out in the 2010s but for every one good cartoon you have to deal

          <span style="display: none;" id="review334219">
        with 10 forgetful, lazy, poorly animated, pandering, and offensive garbage cartoon that are void of certainty and passion.<br />
Say all you want about isekai anime but least there don&#039;t outstay their welcome by not receiving multiple seasons compared to cartoons nowadays where they keep receiving squeals despite many people despising them.<br />
Lucky this western cartoon-inspired anime series Welcome to Demon School Iruma doesn&#039;t fall into the same traps as those shows that I just listed.<br />
<br />
Comedy gold is the keyword to describe Iruma Kun. It is a show that understands comedy structure as well as comedic timing. Whenever the series does a joke, the anime makes sure to set up correctly.<br />
No character interactions felt forced it never tried to abuse its gags to a point of annoying. This is all thanks to the series splendid comedy writing which is one of the best I have ever seen period.<br />
<br />
Which leads me to my next positive aspect of Iruma which is worldbuilding and man what a world this is.<br />
It has been a long while since I have been invested in an anime setting and while the demon school itself may not be as special as it uses to but it still outclassed those anime that did that setting because you see when people were recommending this anime to during the fall 19 anime season they often compared it to Rosario + Vampire due to both series being set in demon school and honestly the problem with the Rosario + Vampire is that apart from being an outstandingly horrendous adaptation of a fairly good manga that show did the criminal act of discarding its worldbuilding and setting in favour of sex appeal.<br />
I wanted to see how the demon school society works in Rosario + Vampire but that show wouldn&#039;t let me see as it decides to shovel fan-service right down my throat.<br />
<br />
Throughout the series, we learn about how the demon system works, how demons perform rituals to summon their familiars. How certain activities playout, etc. Iruma Kun perfectly meets the requirements of building a believable and creative world that sticks to rules.<br />
The thing that Iruma Kun stand out from your typical comedy anime is that the characters develop along with the comedy.<br />
Every single noteworthy character gets strong and meaningful development.<br />
<br />
One of the best examples of this happens in episode 10 where Iruma and Asmodeus were put in the opposite teams for the dodgeball match where they get ranked. Up to that point, Alice has been all over Iruma to a point where he has been holding back. After Asmodeus sees Iruma determination, he starts to push himself where he starts to put his royalty to Iruma aside so he can give it his all without holding back. This is so good on so many levels. For one it showcased that Asmodeus is not a totally obsessed with Iruma (I hope this gets expanded upon in season 2) and two it gave Iruma the opportunity to come off his shell that he has been mostly hiding in the previous nine episodes.<br />
<br />
Characters are where this show truly shines.<br />
They aren&#039;t the deepest character cast around but they are certainly the most fun and compelling cast I&#039;ve seen in a long while.<br />
Iruma Kun is a fun and engaging protagonist. From his first appearance to the last appearance in the final episode, I was in love with these characters. For starters, he&#039;s a pacifist which is rare for shounen male leads. Rather than solve issues with violence he solves issues by talking in a calm and friendly manner. His character interactions towards the cast were hilarious, and he&#039;s facial expressions every time he gets nervous and worried always had me giggling.<br />
<br />
His character interactions towards the cast were hilarious, and he&#039;s facial expressions every time he gets nervous and worried always had me giggling. Throughout every arc, we see Iruma slowly his through actions.<br />
This is shown in the dodgeball, school festival and devil-idol arcs.<br />
Heck, he even eventually starts singing the demon school anthem at one point despite him being human himself. If that&#039;s not outstanding character development then I don&#039;t know it is.<br />
<br />
Asmodeus is the butt money royal friend of Iruma. I really Asmodeus a lot. He was so fun character to watch. His royalty to Iruma and chemistry toward Iruma and Clara provided a lot of comedic gold of the show.<br />
<br />
The chararter that I never expected at all like at all is Clara. Just be appearance and personality alone you expect to be this annoying moe girl.<br />
Behind her charming annoyance, she&#039;s actually the most developed character in the entire series outside of Iruma and we see that development as early in episode 3 where thanks to Iruma advice as well people talking behind her back she started to recognise that are people who generally like her for who she is rather than what she can do.<br />
That&#039;s not all to Clara. She&#039;s also an incredible comedic relief that enhances the already strong comedy in the series with well-executed punchlines, hilarious fourth-wall-breaking, unique background goofy distractions.<br />
Honestly, if she wasn&#039;t in the series than the show wouldn&#039;t be funny as it is. Clara is essentially the driving force of this show fantastic comedy and removing it would kill off half of the show&#039;s appeal. Easily my favorite character in the show.<br />
The rest of the characters in Iruma Kun were fun and likeable. They either had good development or had quirky personalities that encase the comedy.<br />
<br />
Its very easy for me to label this show as perfect and while I love this series and everything that it stands for I do have some gripes with it. For one I did not like the character Kiriwo whatsoever. He was boring, uninteresting and utterly contrived as he just monologued his evil plans to Iruma just before he does his evil scheme.<br />
<br />
His presence alone hurt the arc as his evil scheme could have worked if he kept quiet or lock Iruma in a cage zipped. The fact he didn&#039;t keep his mouth shut about his evil scheme make the arc very predictable as Iruma would just come and stop the evil scheme from going live. Now, do I think about out it the Batora Party Arc is the worst arc of the entire show. The arc has seven episodes as opposed to the usual 3-4 episodes of the other arc yet somehow the show managed to make the longest arc in the series thus far so uninteresting. Not only that but this is where the series temporarily lost its way. The perfect comedic timing wasn&#039;t as consistent.<br />
Honestly, Iruma carried the arc.<br />
<br />
Atmospheric and nostalgia are the best words to describe Iruma Kun. Its variant, colourful and appealing to the eyes. The background scenery is very stylish. Character designs are distinctive and unique from each other, and the use of sharp colour palette really does a great job of bringing Osamu Nishi art-style to life. Its honestly astonishing how beautiful this show looks.<br />
Sadly I cannot say the same for the animation which more on the rough side. You can tell that from the very first episode that this show was working on a tight budget while the animation never reached to the bad category. It has some good animation moments particularly in the final arcs of the show but the rest of the time its standard if not average in some cases.<br />
<br />
Regardless of that I still find Iruma kun production to be pleasing despite its limitations.<br />
Iruma Kun soundtrack was composed by the crime underrated Akimitsu Honma the same guy who did Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku, and this is easily his best score yet. I loved the spooky score of the series as it provides a lot of atmosphere to the series.<br />
It honestly feels like am listening to the Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy&#039;s soundtrack at points.<br />
<br />
Iruma Kun has some of the best openings and ending themes I heard in a long while. Both are extremely catchy themes that fit the show perfectly.<br />
The voice acting is strong in both languages. The original Japanese audio has a lot of high profiled Seiyuus who all did a great job with the roles that they were given. Ayumu Murase continues to be the king of voicing young and energetic with his amazing voice range without sounding like a girl and his role as Iruma is one of his bests. My favorite Seiyuu performance has to go to Daisuke Ono who voiced Callego the same Seiyuu who voiced Shizuo, Sebastian and Joutarou. Other favourites seiyuu performances include Ayaka Asai as Clara and Saori Hayami as Amelie.<br />
<br />
At the time of this review, I&#039;ve only watched the first 12 episodes of the series dubbed and it was just as good as the original Japanese audio. Granted the dub actor for Iruma is a girl but instead of a boy in the original Japanese audio but she still did a stunning job of bringing the character Iruma to life.<br />
Welcome to Demon School Iruma Kun is one of the funniest shows I have seen in a long while. It&#039;s a series that is filled with so much heart. Despite its rocky animation and its few shortcomings such as the school festival arc, the show perfectly excels at worldbuilding, character development, atmosphere and humour. If you&#039;re tired of watching typical isekai anime than I strongly recommend Welcome To Demon School Iruma Kun.<br />
<br />
It is a magical series that will remember for a long time, despite its minor faults.

    This is a real fun anime.<br />
<br />
From the amazing opening soundtrack that I could listen to for hours. To the great chemistry between characters that have honestly made me laugh a number of times.  I&#039;ll certainly remember this show for a good while, and here is why.<br />
<br />
As mentioned above, the opening song is really awesome. I found myself listening to it a number of times on Youtube afterwards. It&#039;s a real good beat, and it being so up beat. The sounds in the show are great too, it&#039;s really nice.<br />
<br />
As I&#039;ve said too, the chemistry between the cast really is great. A mixture of a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review322800">
        number of demons, from serious, to prideful, to borderline crazy, but in the most fun way. To our main who is a lovely sweet boy that you&#039;re just bound to love. Add all that together and you&#039;ve got a great mix of a cast that&#039;ll keep the entertaining and interest factor going.<br />
<br />
As for the story? It&#039;s great! I honestly want to know more about the demon school, and who else attends it. Along with what other lessons are taught there. It&#039;s story is quite good with a nice and sweet human boy now suddenly attending a Demon school, hiding his humanhood. It&#039;ll be interesting to see how long it lasts, and what the overall reaction will be.<br />
<br />
So I&#039;d say, give ti a watch!

    The only good news for everyone involved: The worst moment in your career is surely behind you.<br />

Whoa, have you ever noticed how anime talk to each other? Take Murase Ayumu, who just recently voice acted as a bitterly disillusioned teacher in Tony Kaye&#039;s american movie indictment of the education system, Detachment. Now he&#039;s back in the groves, or at least the stems, of academe in Welcome to Demon High School, a stoner demon comedy with a slightly musty vintage aroma. And this time he&#039;s seriously detached.<br />
<br />
You might envy voice actors for their wealth and fame, but think about this: At least your total humiliation

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331200">
        hasn&#039;t been immortalized in a feature-length movie.<br />
<br />
Not so for voice actor Murase Ayumu, Kimura Ryouhei, Hayami Saori and the other voice actor stars, would-be stars and may-never-be stars of &quot;Demon High School,&quot; a mortifyingly unfunny attempt at a stoner comedy. Directed and co-written with almost malicious ineptitude by Moriwaki Makoto which i not care to count., the anime makes its most talented voice actors look like desperate wash-ups. Even the female extras who agreed to go nude in the obligatory shower scene must be sorry they got involved.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s almost a funny idea, but Naberu Callego &quot;jokes&quot; are either weirdly blank (a stoned teacher, voice acted by Ono Daisuke, throws snacks into the air), incredibly lame (an Asian student with an obscene last name). It doesn&#039;t help that NHK and Bandai shoots &quot;Demon High School&quot; like a horror film, using low-angle close-ups that make his characters look like grimacing ghouls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Demon High School&quot; almost feels like a list of blackmail-worthy moments. The only good news for everyone involved: The worst moment in your career is surely behind you.<br />
<br />
Rating: 4/10<br />

    I kinda had high hopes going into the series. Since it&#039;s primarily a shounen-com anime I expected the jokes to be lighthearted but at least, funny. That&#039;s not the case though. The anime uses the standard generic &quot;anime humor&quot; that makes little to no regular teenagers who&#039;s above 14 to laugh, what I mean by anime humor is that it&#039;s the type of lame immature overused jokes you find in shounen that you&#039;ll probably not laugh to. There&#039;s so much shounens out there with actual good comedy that can even make grown men laugh such as a Gintama, Great Teacher Onizuka and Nichijou. So the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review341162">
        lackluster &quot;comedy&quot; this series has will not be excused as there are shounens with actual good comedy.<br />
<br />
The plot and characters are nothing special. The plot is not completely generic (although the premise kinda is lol) but at the same time it&#039;s not good either. The story isn&#039;t phenomenal nor is it &quot;good&quot;. It&#039;s just bland. it&#039;s literally what Gordon Ramsay would say to you in every episode of Hell&#039;s kitchen when you serve him garbage. Just plainly BLAND. There&#039;s little to no plot elevation, mediocre world-building, semi-generic and bland writing, characters that are not the least bit interesting nor charming. And to top it all of, NO ONE is funny in the series. I genuinely can&#039;t understand people who&#039;s over 16 to laugh off to this. I can&#039;t actually find a single character who&#039;s written very well, has a personality and charm to him/her which stands out completely from the rest. Most of their personalities are generic, predictable and boring. <br />
<br />
I do NOT recommend this series at all if you&#039;re looking for a good laugh or if you are looking for a cast full of charming characters with well-written backgrounds and personalities because this series (other than the plot) is as generic, boring and bland as it gets.

    A truly funny and cute anime.<br />
<br />
So where can we start here? I still don&#039;t know if this is an isekai or not but it probably isn&#039;t one. This anime just manages to make me laugh with its comedy and absurdity. The character are just very lovable and likable. They have good chemistry with each other.<br />
<br />
Story: So we start off seeing Iruma working somewhere in a ship that handles frozen fish? Iruma tells us that his parents are fucking shit since they don&#039;t do anything and just forces Iruma to work a lot. The ship starts shaking and lots of frozen food starts falling but Iruma

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331204">
        dodges all of the falling stuff since his dodge is at least 100. He then suddenly gets kidnapped and arrives into the demon world. A spell is cast on him that lets him speak and understand the Demon language. After that Iruma is sent to school, a demon school that is. He, much like Yoshikage Kira, doesn&#039;t want that people pay attention to him but that ain&#039;t going to happen. Since his &quot;Granpa&quot; is the headmaster of the school he gets too much attention. He becomes a celebrity overnight after getting into a fight and winning with a suplex. The man who Iruma defeated joined Irumans crew. He then meets a very happy, weird and hyper demon named Clara. We mostly follow their adventures and their school day. Sometimes it is packed with action and stuff and sometimes it is just them doing dumb things.<br />
<br />
Characters: Iruma is our Protagonist who got kidnapped into the demon world. He for some reason can dodge anything. He is very kind and caring for others and can&#039;t refuse anything if someone says &quot;please&quot;. He only wants to be the background character but he stands out too much. Alice Asmodeus  is the demon Iruma defeated. He then later joined him. Asmodeus is like Irumas bodyguard. He is very competitive and strong. He can utilize fire magic. He is funny and his best scenes are when he is alone with Clara. Clara Valac is very hyper and funny character. She is also kinda dumb but cute as heck. Her first friends were Asmodeus and Iruma. Before that she was just used as a tool. Her magic is kinda powerful. She can take anything out of these two pockets and I mean literally anything. Amelie Azazel is the Student body president. She appears to be very strong. She was the first one to suspect that Iruma was a human. She, for some reason has a lots of Romance manga. And Iruma usually reads it to her. Most of the supporting cast are also very unique looking and funny or cool. <br />
<br />
The opening is amazing once again. It has very cool visuals and oh boy the song is a banger. The ending is also nice and it has a good song. The background music is also very good. There are relaxing tunes in there but there is also some tunes that gets the adrenaline pumping. Like in the Dodgeball tournament where it was a 1v1 Iruma vs Alice.<br />
<br />
This much like many comedy anime is very funny but comedy tends to be relative so this might not be the show for everyone. I personally liked it since episode 1 due to the cool designs, the characters, the colors and such. So I recommend this show a lot. It is very funny.

    First of all, I have to say that I really like monster school or fantasy slice-of-life anime, but that doesn&#039;t mean that I automatically like all of them. Mairimashita! Iruma-kun is one of the worse ones that I&#039;ve seen, though not the absolute worst. The plot is a bit meaningless. As of episode 8, there is no overarching plot, but there doesn&#039;t have to be. I enjoy anime without one just fine. But the characters... Oh god, they are so flat and sometimes just downtime annoying. They are weird caricatures of characters, each one having maybe one or two features. The lead is a Mary

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327838">
        Sue who accidentally does things that impresses people even though he actually would prefer to stay out of the lime light. Most of the characters are just a bit annoying or simply boring. But Clara is one character that I hate so much. I just want to drop kick her. She is the most annoying character I&#039;ve seen in a while. Characters like her can be fun for one episode but not as a main character. So in summary, the characters are flat and one-dimensional, and the show just isn&#039;t funny enough for me to watch random episodes that go nowhere when I don&#039;t even like the cast.

    Honestly with every season of anime, it’s probably encouraged to watch as much anime as you can. Sure, there may be sequels or highly anticipated adaptations that you want to watch. That’s fine. Do as you please. But it’s worth to give other shows a shot because you might find a gem that you like. I found myself in this situation with this show as I almost didn’t watch before it aired. My gaze was more focused on other shows like No Guns Life, Beastars and Cautious Hero. Shows from fall 2019 that looked more intriguing than this show. It was a last minute decision

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331195">
        and I decided to watch it. What I found was not only one of the more enjoyable shows of fall 2019, but one of the most underrated shows from 2019 in general. <br />
<br />
Sit back, relax and hope you get abducted by your own daemon grandpa as I present to you the anime review for, Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun. Lets begin shall we? <br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10 <br />
<br />
Our story follows Iruma Suzuki, a young lad who is forced to work because of his lazy and irresponsible parents that won’t do any labour. However one day, he finds out that his parents have sold him to a daemon by the name of Sullivan. Sullivan takes Iruma to hell where he plans to adopt Iruma as his grandson, giving him a rather luxury life and have him attend the daemon school Babyls. However there is one thing, in order to hide the fact that Iruma is a human, he wants to maintain a low profile to make sure that he is not eaten. <br />
<br />
Of course this being a high-school comedy anime, that plan goes up s**ts creek from the word go. As he soon finds out that Sullivan is chairman of the school who loves to talk about his new grandson and he took the spotlight from the expected honour student, Asmodeus and get into a fight with him. What follows is some very well done comedic episodes and some well done world building. Like Iruma, we don’t know how the society these daemon run, so we learn slowly how this society is run, their views on the world and on humans and how daemons get their powers. It’s done well and is done sometimes in comedic fashion. It’s not trying to portray it in some dark, gritty fashion, but a more light hearted, goofball fashion that helps set a consistent tone so we know throughout what kind of show Iruma-kun is. <br />
<br />
Now the show kind of takes a more episodic approach with its storytelling, only really getting into more multi-episode storylines around the halfway mark. But it does help with the pacing of the show. It starts by setting its world and characters and then gets into some more interesting storylines once the setting is established. The show never felt like it was rushing anything in order to get a conclusion to something. But it never felt like it was moving at snail’s pace either. It had a nice balance to it to keep me engaged throughout; with plenty of intrigue to keep you waiting for the next episode. There was a bit of a lull moment during the battler arc for me but it picked itself up rather quickly and quickly got back on track.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 9/10<br />
<br />
Iruma is the kind of character that doesn’t have anything unique to them as he is a rather generic, nice guy protagonist, but he does have a certain charm to him that makes him a likeable protagonist. Mainly because he’s flawed and can’t reject a request and say no; even if he thinks it’s a bad idea. That and he has impeccable dodging skills due to all of the labour he has done. It’s his quirks that make him enjoyable because he has that rather nice spirited, selfless mindset yet it ain’t to the point of obnoxiousness where you want to strangle him for it. He hits that nice balance but again, there isn’t anything totally unique that makes him stand out from other protagonists but everything about him is done quite well. <br />
<br />
Now the rest of the cast is what helps give this show its legs in my opinion. Asmodeus is a great prideful, yet a total suck up character who reminds me of Demiurge from Overlord where he thinks Iruma is a masterfiul genius and everyone should bow down to him and his might and should be respected. And much like the protagonist of Overlord, Ains Ooal Gown, Iruma is just winging it at times. Which does lead to some comedic moments. Clara is where half of the goofiness comes from this show as she is just a ball of playfulness and energy waiting to share it with someone. She does round out a well balanced trio of main leads as she is the most free spirited and carefree out of our main leads; with Asmodeus being more by the book and sensible one, whereas Iruma is somewhere in between. But they ain’t the only ones I like. Sullivan is the other half of the goofiness of this show and his personality really makes you want to have a daemon grandpa of your own. Always smothering Iruma when he gets the chance and becomes the parent figure Iruma deserves. <br />
<br />
But my favourite character without a doubt is our resident tsundere and class president, Amelie Azazel (who is best girl by the way, come at me bro). The reason being is that her personality is just great. While she isn’t a strict tsundere as she does open up to Iruma more as time goes on, she has a strong will as she is the student council president and must help maintain order in the school. Yet she does have her soft, girly side as she has access to some forbidden texts that she is infatuated by (which I won’t spoil what they are if you haven’t seen it) and develops an affection towards Iruma. This leads to these two having excellent chemistry with one another; which is just the tip of the iceburg with the rest of the cast and how they interact with each other. <br />
<br />
Of course, I haven’t mentioned characters like Iruma’s homeroom teacher Naberius, Magical apparatus battler leader, Kiriwo or Iruma’s “rival,” Sabnock who are also great characters, which should go to show how much I like these cast of characters. They help bring something to the table and while they may not be fleshed out compared to others, they do fulfill their own niche that makes the cast as a whole enjoyable. <br />
<br />
<br />
Animation: 4.5/10 <br />
<br />
There’s some good when it comes to the animation and some very bad. First the good. The art style for this show is very bold with its colours and helps make some of the characters rather distinct from one another. As well as the background art that helps set a more light hearted, gothic atmosphere, like how Bablys looks from a drawn out distance. It helps give this fun vibe that makes the light hearted and goofy nature of Iruma-kun more enjoyable while also acknowledging what kind of world our characters are in. <br />
<br />
Now the bad. This show cheaps out A LOT with its animation As if the animation didn’t feel lacklustre enough with sliding panel shots and still images, they use the same few character models for background characters WITHIN THE SAME SHOT and that’s if they animate a character at all and they just have a silhouette in the background. I know this show ain’t heavy on the action but I would have liked for them to put more effort into the animation quality because despite how good the art style is, it still can be jarring if the animation quality isn’t up to standards. While I do recall a couple of times where the animation was alright, most of the time, it was pretty bad.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
<br />
The sound does do its job to help set the scene, which to be fair, they do a good job of it. But I don’t recall a single point in the soundtrack that really stands out above the rest. I don’t find the soundtrack to be bad in any particular sense, but it never made want to go back and listen to it again. <br />
<br />
The opening, &quot;Magical Babyrinth&quot; by DA PUMP, certainly matches the tone of the show with a light hearted, hip-hop sound that I didn’t really get bored watching or listening to it. The funky beat and lyrics made the opening more enjoyable than I was expecting. The ending on the other hand, &quot;Devi-Cue&quot; by Yuu Serizawa, was an ending sequence that I tried to get into but didn’t carry the same charm that the opening did. While I like the style that was used to animate the ED, the song was a bit of a turn-off in my opinion. After watching it a few times, I skipped over it, only remembering the very end in order to watch the SU-KI-MAs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion: <br />
<br />
While the show is underwhelming from a production standpoint, Iruma-kun surprisingly turned out to be a very fun watch. The story is funny and charming and I really do like the cast of characters that are on display here. It’s a testament to how good writing and characters can overcome lousy production values. It’s worth the watch if you are looking to watch a high school comedy with a fantasy flare to it. All the while, you realise that this is technically an Isekai show. Although is it really? Iruma does get sent to another world, but it’s hell so does it count? Ah never mind. It really is a shame that this show didn’t get enough attention as it did back in the fall season, because it really was one of the best shows of that season, regardless of the faults. So yeah check this one out when you can. <br />
<br />
<br />
My Personal enjoyment: 8.5/10 <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall Score: 7.2/10 Recommendation: Watch It

    This anime deserves so much more recognition!! I am in love with the story and the characters x.x it&#039;s so sad when amazing anime like this one don&#039;t get recognition. Love the characters they are all so unique with awesome personalities that I&#039;ve not seen before. The art is amazing as well as the designs of everyone, even background characters. Background art is also great. Makes it very memorable and it&#039;s just beautiful to look at in general. If you want a great story and comedy mixed together perfectly then you seriously need to give it a watch!!!!!!!! <br />
<br />
overall you just need to watch it.
