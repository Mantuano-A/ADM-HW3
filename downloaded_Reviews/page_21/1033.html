This is without doubt one of the funniest animes released in the past few years, and I have never seen parody done so well since the original Jungle wa itsumo hale nochi guu (especially Michishio Nagasumi&#039;s pardoy of Ken from Fist of the North Star, and Runa&#039;s father as the the terminator).<br />
<br />
The art style in this anime, like most parodies, can take a little getting used to, but it doen&#039;t really cause headaches. The characters have all have their own quirks and foibles

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1202">
        (San-chan&#039;s sakura petals appearing out of nowhere for instance, and Nagasumi&#039;s first kiss - I laughed so hard I got cramps), but these traits enhance the characters. <br />
<br />
One of the biggest plus points for this anime is the ending. All too often in anime we see a great series end with a whimper. Not here. The ending was brilliant in both it&#039;s seriousness and it&#039;s humour - in other words it&#039;s seriously funny. <br />
<br />
I would recommend this series to anyone who likes jaw dropping, side splitting, mind boggling humour. I have laughed as much since I first watched Inukami - now there&#039;s ashow that&#039;s SO wrong :D

    First off, I would like to get this straight. I am not a huge fan of romance anime&#039;s, throw in a harem in the way, then just forget about it . Now, dont get me wrong. I am not saying this anime breaks away from the tired formula of harems, in fact it has the word cliche written all over it. But what separates this anime from the rest, is  how it uses those cliche to its advantage.<br />
<br />
Read the synopsis, an average student gets forcibly married to the girl. We all know how those goes, right? Yes, the plot has been done a hundred

          <span style="display: none;" id="review7872">
        times before and its teeming with stereotypical characters. Even each individual episode is predictable, as the anime goes through any harem anime would. Throughout the anime more girls come to like the protagonist, more fan service. its all textbook execution.<br />
<br />
Make no mistake here. Yes, the episode start out predictable at first, but you have no idea what Seto is capable of. It will go from cliche and then takes a huge step forward and jump to embellished. It has a fast paced and frankly, I liked it.<br />
Its a nice change of pace. You get to laugh non-stop in a whole episode.<br />
<br />
I have no qualms for the sound and animation, as it does not pursue to be anything different. The animation is what you expect it to be in an anime(gravity defying hairs, radiant character designs) and the sound does nothing to stand out for me to mention anything. But from the start of the OP, it tells you that the anime will make you laugh.<br />
<br />
But one of the key factors of why Seto No Hanayome is so downright hilarious is its brilliant application of the K.I.S.S theory. Seto No Hanayome is by no means a laid-back anime, but at the same time, there is no dull moment here as every moment is hectic enough for you to go &amp;quot;lmfao!&amp;quot;. It tries to be what it can and should be, simple and funny. Because of this, the formula works.The anime is all about comedy, nothing else. It wont throw you any cheap drama just for the hell of having it. Although because its lackluster for romance, it becomes a turn off people who hunger for something amatory. But that doesnt mean the relationship between Nagasumi and San doesnt develop, its just a little late thanks to the rest of the female cast that constantly grasps Nagasumi&#039;s attention.<br />
<br />
Another strong points of Seto is its parodies. Its derision ranges from Japanese Culture to American, heck, it even makes fun of itself. Who wouldve thought that they actually include a Hokuto No Ken parody here? Not to mention Terminator. Every episode will have you tapping the floor at least once because of its unrelenting low-brow humor. <br />
<br />
The supporting characters also gives way for comedy, as each of one of them is provides comic antics albeit that all of it are horrifically trite. Whether its the over-protective father, the yandere, or the timid class president, they will all crack you up. Plus, the influence and interaction on each other have has a significance.And to my surprise, there is even character development. The typical lame protagonist not only goes through a transition, but something you can never imagine. He is able to mature, and he erase whatever bad impression you have for harem male leads.<br />
<br />
Seto No Hanayome adds nothing new to the genre. It is another recycling of harem anime&#039;s. But its sheer presence of comedy is outstanding that you&#039;ll pay no attention to its unoriginal qualities. For the first time in a long time, a harem is done right.<br />
<br />
To sum up, Seto No Hanayome is the romantic comedy that you have been looking for. Its rollicking, its over-the top and its just plain straightforward. To say its funny, would be an understatement. This is cliche at its best.

    Seto no Hanayome is a Romantic, Comedy about a young boy who was saved from drowning by a beautiful mermaid and according to mermaid law, he/she must die. However to escape their wrath, he decides to marry her but this will eventually cause more problems. The premise of the show may be that of an average Romantic Comedy but it is so enjoyably fun to watch that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.<br />
<br />
That is basically how the story begins and from that point on there really isn&amp;rsquo;t any storyline that moves the series along, but just a bunch of random cliched settings that every anime fan is familiar

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1413">
        with. That&amp;rsquo;s not all, as this anime happens to move so fast that you can easily forget what joke was made a couple minutes ago but that is the style that works well with the show. Even though this is a romantic comedy, it is the comedy that is prominent throughout and it is the various parodies, which allows this unlikely show to rival the more popular series such as: Excel Saga and Lucky Star.<br />
<br />
All the characters in this anime are great in their own individual way however out of all of them it is the male protagonist that truly stands out. Not only that he brings out the comedy from the characters around him but he also manages to act in a believable manner and he always ends up saying what we might be thinking, at the time. <br />
<br />
The quality of the animation is really hard to describe, where at times it can look piss poor there are also times it looks great, but this is really just to suit the whacky nature of the show. The action parody moments are the times when the animation truly shines and it&#039;s those moments which are to look forward to. On the other hand the music is decent, nothing amazing or special about it but good enough to gain merit.<br />
<br />
Overall Seto no Hanayome is one of those anime series, appearing every now and again, that may seem average but manages to surpass your expectations. This proved to be one of the most enjoyable comedy anime series of the year 2007, with plenty of laughs to be had. Yet it was lacking in the story department, to allow it to reach the same level of other popular Parody Rom/Coms (Fumoffu?). Nonetheless, as a comedy, this is one you must see.<br />

    DO NOT watch this anime in public (especially when you are surrounded by people, ie. library @ school, internet cafe, or wherever) unless you want to embarrass yourself due to uncontrollable laughing-out-loud (a real LOL). Consider yourself warned!<br />
<br />
To start it off, I consider Seto no Hanayome a masterpiece of its genre(s). It is unfortunate that Seto no Hanayome was aired at the same time as Lucky Star, as some of its glory was &quot;drowned&quot; by it.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
There isn&#039;t much of a storyline to really talk about for Seto no Hanayome except for how everything got started (which you can read from the synopsis above). After that,

        each episode basically consists of random events follow by some more ridiculously stupid events and help bring us to the end. However, these little the bits and pieces of randomness does build up quite well overtime and give us a broad picture of not only the main casts, but the general surrounding environment as well. However, each mini story are all very well thought out and made my guts cry in pain (due to uncontrollable laughter).<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
It is quite obvious that the animation crew have put in a lot of effort to make the viewers enjoy the show in different perspectives. They are very clever in the sense that know WHEN to over-emphasize on character expressions to make the show hilarious. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The OP is pretty catchy, but overall there isn&#039;t anything that I can recall to be particularly outstanding. Although the occasional theme music matches very well with whatever that is going on in that episode. I also love the music that accompanies  San&#039;s chivalrous moments.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
All characters (the main and supporting casts) are all unique in their own way and they all help contribute to the parody of the show. Due to the lack of story, Seto no Hanayome actually end up with plenty of room for character developments and they did a very good job at that. One can feel the &quot;liveliness&quot; of each character as they mature throughout the show.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment + Overall:<br />
Come to think of it, I have never rated an anime (especially one with virtually NO main story plot) a 9/10 overall. I am still pretty surprised at myself, but as I compare Seto no Hanayome to previous anime of the same genre that I have watched, it is hard to put them on the same level. Definitely a must watch for everyone who wants a laugh of their lifetime.

    I can summarize this entire anime in one short phrase: AHHHHHHH! <br />
I kid you not, the show cannot go hardly a minute without an interjection or over-the-top exclamation. I seriously had a hard time getting into this mainly for that reason. Even though it was a rom/com/harem anime, a genre which I generally enjoy, this, however, I really had to fight to stay interested. <br />
<br />
The overall story&#039;s main arc is developed by our hero meeting a mermaid during his summer vacation. Well, as you could expect, things don&#039;t work out too peacefully, and the story takes it from there - death, or marrying a (rather

          <span style="display: none;" id="review20768">
        cute/nicely drawn) mermaid (the one that saved him). The story is summarized nicely in its panel here and any guesses you might have about how the story ends up will probably be correct, as this anime is, for lack of a better term, &quot;predictable&quot;. <br />
It&#039;s pretty original; and probably the most redeeming part of this anime. I mean, what would you do if you were to be married-off at 14-15? <br />
You&#039;ll encounter other &quot;sub-arcs&quot; throughout the entire series, mostly encompassing two-to-three episodes, but overall, the main focus here is on the relationship between our hero and San (can&#039;t remember the boy&#039;s name at the moment); as these sub-arcs serve to only further advance the progress of the main arc. This is what really saves this anime from being a shouting train wreck. 7/10.<br />
<br />
I liked the art a lot. Some of the funniest moments were when San or Luna were staring blankly at a situation or an event in front of them and they had their entire eyes glaze over and liken to the shade of their hair. There are really a lot of different art styles at play here and most are basically eye-candy. The characters movements aren&#039;t robotic and rusty, but are drawn rather eloquently. 8/10.<br />
<br />
The sound also added a comedic mixture to the characters. It&#039;s hard to describe exactly what I&#039;m referring to, but you&#039;ll have to watch the series to find out. <br />
But, like I stated previously, the sound (a.k.a. &quot;the screaming&quot;)was also a huge gripe. It singlehandedly ruined the enjoyment of this anime for me, probably because I found my ears bleeding halfway in to each episode. Turn down your speakers, volume, what have you, just turn it down, please. 3/10.<br />
<br />
To me, the characters weren&#039;t all that great because they relied too much on the comedy that each of their personalities brought to the table. Which, at first was fresh and funny, and you thought to yourself, &quot;This is a good start, can&#039;t wait to see what new things they can come up with in the next episode for &#039;x&#039; character.&quot; Problem is: they don&#039;t. Each character&#039;s comedy is like washing multiple loads of laundry: wash, rinse, and repeat. <br />
The only characters I found tolerable were, thankfully, San (because she has a lot of screen time) and Luna&#039;s father. <br />
San&#039;s comedy, unlike the rest was just oozing ignorance and awkwardness that you just couldn&#039;t not like it! Her character is somebody you root for because this is a harem; there is some competition for our hero. <br />
Luna&#039;s father was just as funny because of the obvious reference to him as Arnold Schwarzenegger in the &quot;Terminator&quot; trilogy. It was hilarious to hear him say his lines and his actions towards the other characters were definitely Arnold-esque, and, I thought, very funny. I would easily vote him as the best character in the series. <br />
Others aren&#039;t so fortunate. Maki just ends up being extremely annoying and one-dimensional, which really is a shame because she had an opportunity to be a really intriguing character; Gozoburo (San&#039;s father) just screams all of his lines nonstop, and I can clearly picture the voice actor saying those lines surrounded by hundreds of bottles of water in the recording studio just gasping for breath and scratching his throat. Luna, ended up being just an odd character, the way that they drew her as &quot;crazy Luna&quot; was too much for me to be funny and it had the lasting effect of being generally creepy. PLUS SOME MORE SUB-PAR CHARACTERS! 5/10.<br />
<br />
My enjoyment was not a satisfactory one. If you take a look at how many episodes I watched, you&#039;ll see that I didn&#039;t watch all 26. The three that I didn&#039;t watch were episodes I turned off because I was just so fed-up with the so called &quot;humor&quot; that was recycled so many times it resembled garbage, the ridiculous amount of screaming, or just me thinking, &quot;Why was this even an episode? They could have used the money spent on this towards feeding the homeless.&quot;<br />
There were seldom, and very few bright spots, throughout the series. The love story was cute, but not as engaging as other animes out there, the comedy was VERY hit-and-miss, the story was okay, and most of the characters just wanted to make me pull my hair out. 5/10.<br />
<br />
I wanted so badly to get into this anime. After reading some reviews, I was so psyched to watch it! Well, either my expectations were too high or something else happened, because I could just not get into it. The potential was there, which makes it so frustrating: a fairly original story, a harem that&#039;s actually above average, a love story that&#039;s engrossing and cute, but all for not. <br />
Overall, this anime tries too hard to be funny by forcing it down, into your ears with all the screaming dialog, the love story is under-represented, the vast majority of the characters are annoying, and nothing really happens, other than a few characters get introduced throughout the length of the series. But, you know when an anime&#039;s a definite miss when a reviewer thinks you could end it at episode 14 and not waste making 12 more episodes. 5/10.<br />

    Sometimes it is just nice to have a ordinary love story. A young man and a mermaid find one another and get engaged under pain of death. The father in-law sics a shark on the young man and calls him up in the middle of the night and whispers in a deep voice “I am going to rip your frickin balls off”. You know the usual father in-law type of things. O and I forgot the father in-law is part of the underwater Yakuza. Yea just another ordinary love story. <br />
<br />
The show opens with a mermaid saving a young boys&#039; life. The boys name is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23882">
        Nagasumi and the mermaids name is San. Apparently there is a rule that if a human sees the true form of a mermaid that mermaid must die. Sans father isn&#039;t exactly crazy about that idea, so he comes up with a plan. He is going to kill Nagasumi. San and her mother are not in love with that plan so they come up with a new one. If Nagasumi marries San he will be part of the mermaid clan and the problem will be solved. Sans father doesn&#039;t want to loose his precious little girl to marriage so he comes up with a plan. He is going to kill Nagasumi. No one ever blames Sans father for being overly creative. From here the craziness ensues, plus you know all the attempted killings.<br />
<br />
More than anything “Seto no Hanayome” is about nonstop comedy. I did find a lot of the show funny but the show is really NONSTOP comedy. The show just never lets up. Plenty of genuine moments of romance or storytelling are ruined by the shows need to tell a joke every second and a half. This is also the main reason why so many jokes are just pounded into the ground. The first time Nagasumi is almost killed, funny; 5 billionth time, not so much. The show does get better at knowing when to let up as time goes on but even at the end it is pretty bad.<br />
<br />
It is a shame that the show is so crazy most of the time because underneath all of it is actually a good romance. Most of the usual high school romance plot devices are used. Several girls have crushes on Nagasumi, love triangles, etc. The thing is these things are all down played so much it is almost as through they aren&#039;t there. Example, Kai is introduced a few episodes into the show. He has had a crush on San sense he was young and vows to steal San away from Nagasumi. He makes a big attempt on the first episode he is introduced but that is about it. He is still there for the rest of the show and he continues to hate Nagasumi but he really doesn&#039;t do anything to try to steal San away. I think he makes one attempt right before the end of the show but that is all. There are obvious complains to be made for introducing plot elements and then never really doing anything with them, but I really enjoy this approach. None of the clutter that usually comes with a romances are here. There isn&#039;t a group of girls pushing themselves on one guy episode after episode, you don&#039;t have two people who obviously like one another but take 15 episodes for one of them to say something, and even though they are both very dedicated to carrying out the promise of marriage neither are under some dilution of love at first site. So at the end of the day what you have is just a guy and a girl getting to know one another. <br />
<br />
The cast is, if nothing else, interesting. Everyone is pretty much insane in their own fashion. Nagasumi and San are easily the two most normal, but considering their competition that isn&#039;t necessarily saying a whole lot. San seems normal enough most of the time but other times she seems oblivious to situations including Nagasumis near death experiences. Nagasumi is freaking out for half of every episode, admittedly he is trying to be assassinated a lot of the time so it is somewhat justified. Individually these two are OK but together as a couple they really seem to shine. The rest of the cast plays their comical rolls. This isn&#039;t to say I didn&#039;t enjoy them or that they don&#039;t have personalities, because they definitely all have their own personalities. It is just that they don&#039;t really get any development and the part they play in the story is to setup jokes. The characters do go along with the none stop comical style of the show.<br />
<br />
The main fault of this show is that it tries too hard. Which is too bad because I did enjoy a lot of the comedy and there is a nice romance hidden in here. With the show just not knowing when to let up the comedy gets tiresome after a little while and too many moments that didn&#039;t need comedy are ruined. If you are someone who doesn&#039;t mind comedy that never lets up even in scenes were it probably should than I highly recommend it. You will have the comedy you love plus a decent romance. For anyone else my guess is you will start getting a little frustrated with the show before you get to the halfway point.

    I read the reviews for this anime, and thought it would be great... I was wrong. I&#039;m not a fan of the harem anime&#039;s from the start, and I didn&#039;t originally think this would be like that. <br />
Honestly it&#039;s best redeeming quality is the opening theme...<br />
<br />
It&#039;s supposed to be funny, but I find it hard to watch due to the fact that basically every episode consists of yelling and screaming. And really, the whole trying-to-kill-Nagasumi thing gets old REALLY fast. A lot of things happen, but I haven&#039;t laughed at all, because it&#039;s more annoying than funny. <br />
<br />
The story is hidden in the background of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29966">
        the attempted humour, and isn&#039;t all that great, either. <br />
The character are alright, but none of them stand out as unique. Nagasumi is no different from guys in other harem animes, and none of the characters are fresh. <br />
<br />
The art and sound of the anime are the only things I enjoyed. I really wanted to get into it, but EVERY episode is the same. I&#039;m not even finished the series yet, but I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ll even be able to. <br />
They could have made this story really funny, and there is potential for it, but they fail.

    My Bride is a Mermaid, wow, just wow.<br />
<br />
In my life, I&#039;ve only experienced exuberant mirth once.<br />
I found myself fallen from my chair, gripping the underside of my couch, asphyxiating from laughter, tears streaming down my cheeks as my sides burned in protest. I can truly, without a doubt, say that this show is a one of a kind comedic experience, and was it ever fun. <br />
Savvy, that&#039;s what My Bride is a Mermaid is.<br />
<br />
Artwork and Animation: 10<br />
<br />
My Bride is a Mermaid covers an immense amount of animation styles. Given that it&#039;s part parody, many of these styles are directly inspired by other popular and well

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186190">
        known series. There are several Jojo inspired bits, Fist of the North Star, Death Note, Naruto, the list goes on and on and on. Pop culture makes an enormous splash here too, with things like the Terminator. <br />
On top of all this, Mermaid manages to have its own style as well, which is rather cutesy and exaggerated, but lends itself well to the comedy. It&#039;s very fluid, very fast moving, with lots of GIANT EXPLODING BOLD TEXT, and small details that are easy to overlook that all add up into one massive reference filled laugh fest. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound and Voice Acting: 10<br />
<br />
This is the definitive English dub experience, truly. An ensemble cast of industry veterans and new voices alike, Mermaid is absolutely riotous with these zany, extremely energetic performances. Todd Haberkorn (FMAB), Alexis Tipton, and Cherami Leigh head up a star studded cast of voice talent, and to great effect. The ubiquitous Monica Rial stands out as Maki, the pint sized, voracious mob assassin; Christopher Sabat as Masa, the smooth talking ladykiller right hand man; and finally John Swasey as Gozaburo Seto: constantly livid, definition-of-rage mob man to name a few other standouts. The voices are incredibly dynamic, engaging, and utterly hilarious, all the time. Never a dull moment with this group.<br />
<br />
The OP and ED are great tunes, the ska-surf feel of the intro fits in perfectly with the ocean/sea theme, and the endings are cute. <br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 10<br />
<br />
Nagasumi Michishio is the quintessential &quot;short-legged, good for nothing, unimpressive&quot; middle school loser. He&#039;s got nothing going for him- he&#039;s a total klutz, goofy as they come, and has a penchant for getting himself into dangerous situations, which play off more and more hilariously as the series progresses. What he does have going for him, though, is heart. After he&#039;s saved from drowning by Sun Seto, his life takes a turn for the crazy, and all manner of undersea mishaps, misunderstandings, and sheer ludicrousity ensue. <br />
<br />
Sun is a young mermaid, daughter of super dangerous mob boss Gozaburo Seto. Well meaning, but air-headed, Sun often generates as much trouble for Nagasumi as he does for himself, but she stays true, and is a very heartfelt character. She is often used as a foil for Nagasumi, Lunar, or Gozaburo, but she has plenty of moments to shine on her own, too.<br />
<br />
Lunar: diva, pop star, and ferociously possessive to a violent level. She is the definition of cute psycho. One second she&#039;s an axe murdering bitch, the next she&#039;s an adorably narcissistic moe character. As Japan&#039;s biggest pop singer, another lover of Nagasumi&#039;s, and new student at school, Lunar adds yet another dimension of insanity to his previously mundane life. <br />
<br />
About half the supporting cast get nearly as much screen time as the main trio, but this section would be as long as the entire review if I went through all of them individually. <br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
<br />
The basis for My Bride is a Mermaid is a subversion of the Shotgun Wedding. One misunderstanding piled on top of another typically form the crux of the conflict in this show, and while many RomComs follow an episodic style, Mermaid went with a full 26 episode story arc. While it goes off on some tangents, it&#039;s never unpleasant, because it&#039;s just so dang funny. <br />
One thing leads to another, and after Nagasumi is rescued by Sun, he&#039;s presented with an ultimatum: die, or... die. Under mermaid law, if any human sees them in their fish form, they&#039;re to be killed. Either that, or the mermaid who allowed their-self to be seen must be put to death... but when your dad is the most feared mob boss under the seas, that&#039;s not likely. There is a third option, however. The third option is that they get married. <br />
Soon, Nagasumi&#039;s previously boring middle school existence is uprooted when his life is invaded by an entire mob family from under the sea, to uproarious results. They take over his school, his house, all aspects of his life- trying desperately (but failing) to kill him before this wedding happens. Thankfully for Nagasumi, the one thing he&#039;s good at is miraculously being able to avoid being eaten, chopped up, blown up, shot, stabbed, or otherwise destroyed. Let the games begin. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
<br />
I&#039;m no stranger to comedies, holding Seinfeld in the highest regard, but I have never seen a show before that has so consistently made me laugh so hard that I cried. There was not one episode that I didn&#039;t at least chuckle at. Full blown side clutching, tears streaming down were a common occurrence. I can&#039;t award enough points in enjoyment. The humor really clicked with me, and I&#039;ve seen just enough film and anime to get a majority of the parodical elements, which really made the experience that much richer. <br />
<br />
The Branchial Respiration Brothers Jojo remix.<br />
Lunar&#039;s Papa, The Terminator.<br />
The pop culture parody and clever satire, nobody is safe!<br />
The PUNS.<br />
<br />
My Bride is a Mermaid has everything comedy. Despite being in a genre known only for its schlock, Mermaid breaks free of the Rom-Com mold by being FUNNY! A breath of fresh air from the other so called comedies, this one knows when to play it straight, when to lay everything out on the table, when to jump Shark Fujishiro, and how to take the laughter to stratospheric levels. <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 10<br />
<br />
As an homage to the 80s Yakuza film craze, Mermaid starts out with a lot of comedic value. Taken further by the undersea theme- there&#039;s a TON of fodder with all the sea creature jokes and funnies. Mafias made up entirely of mermaids and fish? It&#039;s wacky, it&#039;s crazy, and it&#039;s SO much fun. Every moment is a favorite, it&#039;s endlessly quotable, and there&#039;s something that everyone will recognize and laugh at here. <br />
<br />
<br />
Recommend?<br />
<br />
Absolutely. As far as animated comedies go, this is my #1, forever. Overall, this one might beat out Seinfeld on a good day. It&#039;s really that funny.

    I haven&#039;t done a review in a while, but every now and then a show pops up that just asks for it. Seto no Hanayome is one of those shows.<br />
<br />
So you are looking for a show that can make you laugh? Look no further. Seto no Hanayome is just the thing for you! In all 26 episodes there hasn&#039;t been a single moment that made me consider putting it down. Its just too dang hilarious! No matter what situations the main characters end up in. One thing is guaranteed. And that is a good laugh. <br />
<br />
But SnH manages to go beyond being a funny show.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review2545">
        The story isn&#039;t really anything special. Its just your average sudden bride thing. But its the way they handle it. The easy way out would be putting the 2 in some awkward positions, drop in a rival or 2, and fill the rest up with fan service. And to be honest. to a point SnH does just that. But there is more to it. The main cast is just very lovable. Whether its the cute but naive San, The cute but deep down scary Luna, or the poor but lovable Nagasumi. You can&#039;t help but like them. But the side cast has its unique appeal as well. My personal favorites being Mawari and Shark, Fujishiro. The characters are used to their full potential, and its just hard to hate any one of them. And I almost forgot to mention the excellent voice acting! The story isn&#039;t that impressive, but it carries the show well, and the climax of the series is actually pretty dang impressive. For once we have a romantic comedy that actually gives you a feeling of closure. Even though there is still loads of potential for a second season *crosses fingers*<br />
<br />
Another fun factor comes from the many references to other shows. Not just anime either. From Hokuto no Ken and JoJo&#039;s Bizarre adventure to the Terminator. Its hilarious to spot these references and certainly gives you a reason to watch the show more then once.<br />
<br />
<br />
I could ramble on about it, but i suggest just checking it out. Its funny, its cute, and manly at the same time. Just give it a go, you&#039;ll thank me later.

    I myself am not the biggest fan of the comedy genre, most of the comedy entries these days are bland and generic with no substance that will only get a slight giggle at best. But, Seto no Hanayome is different, it&#039;s a unique entry that actually made me laugh out loud on every single episode, which is amazing considering I don&#039;t like comedy.<br />
<br />
(There will be a tl;dr summary at the bottom for those who don&#039;t like to read)<br />
[LIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD]<br />
<br />
The story starts out with our protagonist Michishio Nagasumi, regarded by most as a useless person that shines in the most useless of ways in useless

          <span style="display: none;" id="review160343">
        situations. He is on vacation on Seto island visiting his grandmother&#039;s. One day while he was at the beach, he went too far out and almost drowned, almost. He sees the image of what looks like a mermaid come to his aid, this mermaid was Seto Sun, the daughter of the Seto mermaid yakuza leader. Since Nagasumi saw Sun in her mermaid form, Sun has two options, she kills him and anyone else who saw her, or she marries him. <br />
<br />
This sets up the series with a premise that allows for a lot of comedy to ensue, &quot;But wait&quot; you might ask, &quot;Hasn&#039;t this premise been done before in things like To Love Ru?&quot; You would be correct, but what separates Seto no Hanayome from the rest is the way that it executes its jokes.<br />
<br />
Most of them fall under the &quot;Ironic Comedy&quot; category, basically setting up a situation where you think you know what&#039;s going to happen next, like a girl trying to confess her feelings to a guy, then throwing a wrench in the works and giving you something completely different then what you expected. Another plot device that produces massive amounts of comedy is the fact that if any mermaid gets water on their legs, their legs turn back into mermaid form<br />
<br />
Also, since this is a parody anime, there are many references and jokes correlating to their respective franchises, such as JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure, Naruto, Dragonball Z, and even Evangelion and Sgt Frog.<br />
<br />
While the subject of comedy is completely subjective and what people find funny varies from person to person, it&#039;s hard to watch this show and not get a hard laugh out of it.<br />
<br />
One of the things I had a gripe with at first was the art style, I could forgive the animation seeing as it was made 7 years ago, but the art style didn&#039;t click with me at first, especially the design of the main heroine, Sun. She has these bang-things that are on the top of her head that go all the way down to her chin, I&#039;m not sure if this is how she was meant to be or if it&#039;s just making fun of similar hairstyles in other anime, because it does resemble a lot of hairstyles from Naruto. Another major gripe I had in general, which were the eyes of the characters, the eyes in particular don&#039;t sit well with me, they look like someone glued legos to their eyes. But I completely understand why they are the way they are, it&#039;s a parody anime, and the art styles of which tend to be on the goofy side of the spectrum, who knows, it might be a light jab at other parody anime.<br />
<br />
Another thing that makes this series great is its cast of characters, as generic as they may be. I&#039;ll start with Seto Sun, the main heroine of the series and love interest of Nagasumi, she comes off as somewhat of an airhead at times but shows a strong passion towards Nagasumi, with the sword skills of a master and a code of honor comparable to that of a medieval knight. Yes, as much as this show likes to flaunt it&#039;s comedy around, it really does have solid characters and character development. <br />
<br />
I might sound like a broken record at this point, but there&#039;s another pro of this anime, that being its soundtrack. It has many tracks that are only played on only one or two episodes, which gives the soundtrack lots of variety, one of my personal favorites being 瀨戶之花嫁-Your Gravitation, which is the song that Seto Sun sings at about the halfway point of the series. It has these tracks that really do enhance the comedy as well as make the scenes of romance that more impactful. Hell, even some of the tracks are a parody, the track Hageshii Uta has a striking resemblance to Through the Fire and Flames by Dragonforce oddly enough.<br />
<br />
Tl;dr: Seto no Hanayome is a unique entry in the rom-com genre that really hits home with the execution of its comedy and overall enjoyment with great music and lots of rewatch potential.

    Let me go out on a limb here and say this. This anime is with no contest the funniest anime I have ever seen. I&#039;m not really a &quot;lol&quot; person but this anime genuinely made me laugh..... a lot.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the story itself is a little cliched. Man forced into marriage due to punishment of death and in laws don&#039;t like it blah blah blah irrelevant. Seto is different due to the fact that it doesn&#039;t need an engaging story to be an engaging anime. The rest of it&#039;s features more than make up for the story and therefore make it irrelevant.<br />
<br />
There was something that made

          <span style="display: none;" id="review26454">
        me fall in love with the art style. At times, it seemed normal, then it became ridiculous and over the top (especially when the main character Nagasumi is being viciously attacked, which happens all the time). The fact that in the funnier scenes, the characters looked ridiculous added to the stupid humour of the whole scene. An amplification, if you will. <br />
<br />
Sound does it&#039;s job, with a catchy musical score. I like the background Western style music that&#039;s played when something &quot;manly&quot; happens and the harmonica thing that plays with something more depressing or the appearance of one of my favourite characters, Masa-san. Voice acting is amazing, with many characters (especially Lunar and Maki, changing their voices, from something normal, to something strange, which is funny)<br />
<br />
Now, the characters are what really shine. You have the main guy Nagasumi, who I really feel sorry for. Damn near every main girl character in the cast is in love with him, which makes for some great scenarios, which don&#039;t exactly end well for Nagasumi, especially when he is suspected of cheating (then again, I would love to be in his position!). Then you have San, who is a girl who is quite dense but with a chivalrous spirit which really shines. Her love for Nagasumi is very admirable and I&#039;m glad the two of them are the main pairing. Then we have Lunar, who is an interesting character, as her personality completely changes depending on the situation to suit her. She is an idol with a tough life, being beaten by San in every way, including Nagasumi, who she loves, but doesn&#039;t show it.<br />
San&#039;s family is great, most of them hate Nagasumi (apart from two I believe) which makes for some great moments when Nagasumi is nearly killed or ordered to be killed. San&#039;s mother stands out as the protector/mentor for Nagasumi, it&#039;s especially satisfying to see her effortlessly stop her husband&#039;s murderous efforts. I love the character of Masa, who makes Nagasumi&#039;s face change to one of total love due to an unfortunate incident with CPR (Nagasumi&#039;s first kiss), which is an awesome running gag.<br />
The classroom characters are also good and well fleshed out. You have Mawari, who is a little unbelievable in how righteous she is, but can be funny, she treats any boy&#039;s advances as being perverted, even accidental ones. Then you have Kai and Saru, who go well together, in a sort of master servant bro-mance way (Saru&#039;s perverted nature makes for great laughs). You have the Class President, a hidden gem as she goes unnoticed the majority of the time, but then turns out to be great looking without the thick glasses. Her lonely nature and her bad luck make her one of my favourite characters. Overall, I love all the characters as they add to the hilarious experience.<br />
<br />
My overall enjoyment was fantastic with every episode having many reasons to watch it again. My favourite episode was 21, and without revealing much, it involves love letters, magic potion, extreme love, extreme hate, and some bad luck. WATCH THAT EPISODE IF NO OTHER!<br />
<br />
I love this anime, I hope for more, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves romance, and laughs.<br />

    Ok, so I have not finish watching this anime, but who cares, I&#039;m done watching it.<br />
<br />
So, here&#039;s an explanation as to why I dropped watching this anime:<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Well, it&#039;s decent enough to be watch by all ages. But I really like the first episode, the deal breaker for me is that I hate the part which the unlucky teenager  is force to be the husband of a mermaid whose family is a high ranking Yakuza- man, I hate those guys and I also hate that they have supernatural powers. And, in every episode the unlucky teenager has find a way to survive his father in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32737">
        law&#039;s wrath and the little assassin who is hired to murder him. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
Art is decent........no more explination.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
I hate the opening theme.<br />
<br />
Charcter:<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t like  the half fish half Afro  character and the mutant goons that comes with it, I don&#039;t like the Yakuza big man and the daddy of the mermaid in the anime, But I kinda find the mermaid&#039;s mom a real hottie especially when she&#039;s in a yukata.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
POOOOOOOOOOOOOR!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
POOOOOOOOOOOOOR!!!!!!!!! <br />
<br />
<br />
Trivia: Manatees and Dugongs a kind of seal like mammals that inhabit the tropical seas and fresh waterways,  were once mistaken as mermaids by early European  explorers.  <br />

    I&#039;m bad with reviews, and the top reviews are most likely what people will only see, but I&#039;ll still write one.  Seto No Hanayome is hands down, the best romcom that I have seen, that uses the usual cliche comedy mechanics, and uses them in a way that is enjoyable AND funny, without being dry or dull.  The story never had a dull moment and had a lot of humorous moments.  There were even references to real-life movies which were fun to figure out and were funny if you understood what they meant or at least, what they were attempting to replicate.<br />
<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147631">
        description of Seto No Hanayome is perfect in describing this show, Ill just leave it at that.   The story, was easy to follow.  Its pretty straight forward and only has a few flashback moments.   The art was a bit old, but I enjoy that style.   They had various forms of it as well, so they can be super detailed and serious, or it could be like how Lucky Star is and thus be not so super detailed.   The sounds, were perfect!   They used the best choice of sound effects and music clips, for the various situations which made the scenes so much funnier.  Characters were all loveable and unique enough to differentiate.   Enjoyment, 10/10   <br />
<br />
Overall, I enjoyed the anime a lot and am extremely grateful to have watched it.   However, I&#039;m only giving it a 10.    The sad part, is that MAL, does not let us give ratings above 10, so I&#039;m forced to give it a 10.  Oh well.

    THIS ANIME IS AMAZING!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Seriously I just finished watching it for the 3rd time and I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that this anime is perhaps the most underrated anime of all time. Not only does the current 7.88 score on mal confuse the heck out of me, it also makes me disappointed that some people may see that score and be turned away by it, although it&#039;s not &quot;low&quot;, it doesn&#039;t do this anime justice. This anime is among the best, among the big boys and definitely a classic that has stood the test of time, I watched this is 2018, it came out in 2007,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294353">
        and I somehow felt like I&#039;m seeing something new and refreshing, absolute fantastic masterpiece that would guarantee you a great time, I&#039;ll tell you why.<br />
<br />
It proves that you really can&#039;t judge a book by its cover, or review on MAL.<br />
<br />
The story is pretty simple and easy to comprehend, although pretty crazy, I won&#039;t explain the whole thing but you should go into this anime with no expectations and no pre-thought about it. The story build up is amazing as well, for such a weird plot, it&#039;s surprisingly comprehensible and intriguing as anime takes its time to set up the story and characters so you care and actually like them.<br />
<br />
The humour in this series is absolutely amazing, every episode is funny asf and jokes never get old. This anime also has some of the funniest and wackiest expressions you&#039;ll ever see, which is definitely a bonus. Especially once shit really goes down around episode 5-20<br />
<br />
The romance is there I guess but that&#039;s not the full point of this anime, some people consider this a &quot;harem&quot; but it&#039;s not like that yuck shit at all. It&#039;s a full on comedy series that could use a little romance here and there but the romance is just a key factor towards the comedy as well. Don&#039;t be expecting some squeaky harem shit, these are all respectable characters that have their dignities straight .<br />
<br />
All the characters are so lovable and there&#039;s not one that lacks behind another, they&#039;re all intricately designed and crafted so that they differentiate between each other and have their own charms and wacky senses, fucking amazing. P.s characters in this are not all introduced straight away <br />
<br />
*The animation in this series, although nothing special at first, immediately starts to hit you, it&#039;s absolutely masterful, each frame is crafted to perfection and the directing is amazing as well, with camera angles being spot on and clear to the scene.<br />
*The art style is also so unbelievably great as well, everytime when the basic animation and set design is about to get old they throw some good shit at you, like a jojo parody or even a comic book style car chase, it&#039;s really rare to see an anime this creative and smart these days, which is a shame as this shit is reeaaaally fun to watch.<br />
<br />
The best I can compare this to is buellers day off, where it&#039;s a crazy comedy with crazy shit happening, but it&#039;s not TOO stupid and outrageous that people could think its for kids. This is for a mature audience that knows how to laugh and have a good time <br />
<br />
All in all, perhaps the funniest and most entertaining rom com anime you&#039;ll ever watch, don&#039;t let the strange introduction throw you off. You know that feeling when you first start a new fresh anime series and you like all pumped up and shit? yeah this anime is like that for every episode you watch throughout the 26 episodes as well as a few ovas. Every episode is expertly crafted and made to maximize your entertainment. Go have a watch right now, trust me you will not regret it.

    I was really impressed by the overall feel of the anime. At first, when Nagasumi was drowning in the ocean and the mermaid comes to the rescue, I was really corny and It didn&#039;t really hit me as anything spectacular. However, halfway through the first episode i was already hooked. And I mean to say, HOOKED!<br />
<br />
Some people may not understand the type of humor they use and I&#039;m sorry for you. This is a spectacular anime. Now I guess i&#039;ll chip it up into different sections and judge it from there.<br />
<br />
Story: The story was and is very good. I love every part of it; the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4066">
        love triangles, the sudden plot twists, and the suspense. (Yes, there is a little bit of suspense in the series. Even though it&#039;s a comedy.<br />
<br />
Art: The art is astonishing. At first glance at the show my reaction was, &amp;quot;wow, i could take a screenshot and print a poster for myself.&amp;quot; The background is drawn very well, details included, and the characters are beautiful. Even Saru.<br />
<br />
Sound: I love the soundtrack. It really helps build the tone and atmosphere are the show.<br />
<br />
Character: Characters are great, great, absolutely great. In the whole show there is not a character that i hate. I loved every single character. Each character has their own charm and different attitudes. (Obviously) But i want to point out that the characters aren&#039;t static. In fact theye are quite dynamic and go through metamorphosis. Nagasume becomes a man; The class president goes through an emotional change; and even Gozaburo, San&#039;s father, changes a bit towards the end.<br />
<br />
This anime is a must watch if you want hours or stomach-clutching humor.

    Very rarely does an Anime come along and make me laugh this much. Seto no Hanayome does a great job at it and I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not the only one.<br />
<br />
Story: It sounds cliche the whole &quot;guy forced into marriage&quot; thing. Normally this would bother me because I get sick of these types of premises but the show makes up for it with great jokes and fun characters. The episodes themselves follow the day-by-day plot. Where each episode either introduces a new character or they just deal with stuff. No real plot here. Unfortunately, the end was a bit rushed and disappointing. There was no buildup

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9410">
        to it and it was mainly one of those &quot;We need to end the series on a serious note&quot; kind of things. It didn&#039;t work for me.<br />
<br />
Art: I think the earlier episodes looked pretty bad. One side of a character&#039;s face would not be proportional to the other side but when a joke happens, the animation&#039;s great. The chibis are fine. The animators definitely put some effort on the scenes that needed funny visually though. A lot of the repeat visual jokes work because of how these scenes look. Unfortunately, the overall animation quality isn&#039;t very good.<br />
<br />
Sound: The background tracks were pretty good. I wish there was an ost. The opening and endings are great songs as well as the insert songs. As for the voice acting, the cast did a spectacular job. Momoi Haruko who does Sun has so many voice shifts (regular, chibi, tough guy, singing, etc.), so it was interesting to listen to and see the talent. The other characters are voiced well too. A lot of the cast are voices you&#039;d recognize and they do a great job.<br />
<br />
Character: A few of them annoyed me but overall the characters are fun and enjoyable to watch. Due to the plotless-ness of most of these episodes, the character interactions make the show a joy to watch.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Some episodes weren&#039;t so great but the series was a good watch. I laughed so hard. I even re-watch certain scenes to brighten my day.<br />
<br />
Overall: This series is gold. I would recommend this to any fan of comedy. Although I suppose most Anime fans would enjoy it. There are two Ovas in addition to this series which were also pretty fun to watch. I&#039;m hoping for a second season since this definitely deserves it.<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading my review. Feedback would be greatly appreciated. Hope this helped.

    Seto no Hanayome is fast-paced, random and hilarious anime at its finest.  It is one of the funniest animes I have personally seen and I&#039;ve had to pause multiple times while watching due to uncontrollable laughter.  <br />
<br />
The story is about a young man named Nagasumi who&#039;s saved by a mermaid named Seto San and due to various circumstances related to her being a mermaid (and also sort of belonging to a triad family), he is forced into marriage with her.  Throughout the anime you will meet absolutely hilarious characters including an overly protective father in law (think crazy triad leader obsessed with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review17175">
        his daughter) and a cute little fairy type creature (looks can be deceiving!).  <br />
<br />
Basically it is a romantic comedy, with more comedy than romance, and the storyline suffers a bit from side tracking to different plots surrounding the different characters you meet along the way.  There wasn&#039;t really a main plot in this anime, more like a collection of stories about Nagasumi and San&#039;s romantic adventures. However, this was absolutely a great thing because all the characters you meet are really funny and interact with each other quite well and in hilarious ways.  Another thing I really appreciated about this anime was the fact that it did not have an overbearingly dramatic romantic plot line near the end like alot of romantic comedies you find nowadays (I find alot of these animes tend to be less funny near the ending due to this).  Instead, the laughter wont stop until you finish the last episode with Seto no Hanayome.<br />
<br />
If you are looking for a comedy with heavy amounts of romance in it, Seto no Hanayome is probably not for you, but if you are looking for a comedy along the lines of Azumanga Daioh, this is one you should strongly consider watching.

    I want to warn some people because people might have wrong expectations. In general I like this type of comedy but still it was one of the worst I ever seen because of main character and his family. Main problem? There is huge focus on suffering without enough mitigation measures. Main hero want but can&#039;t escape from hardcore bullying and in general suffering that grows and at some point push him to think about suicide which actually wouldn&#039;t be so unreasonable in such situation... In most comedies in such circumstances at least main hero is just immune or almost immune to pain or at least

          <span style="display: none;" id="review375925">
        have some escape (just something), but in this anime hero have half baked immunity and sometimes try to be serious which makes everything harder to swallow as comedy. You can feel lost potential, you can feel lessen comedy but also not enough drama to make it drama at any point and because of this it&#039;s easy to feel nothing when you watch it... I have no doubt that especially younger audience won&#039;t have problems with distancing themselves and enjoy this without spotting issues, the problem is that it feels like effort to not lose balance of comedy is below average - this anime brings &quot;why so serious&quot; walls in wrong places in wrong way (It&#039;s not Gintama). It wouldn&#039;t be a problem if hero situation would improve fast or if this in general would bring any value for people who like the show, but it look like it brings nothing for them (it&#039;s not why they like the show, it looks like they can just ignore this issue and that&#039;s it - just look at reviews).<br />
Ending of the show is a strong prove to my point. I won&#039;t spoil anything but I can vaguely explain that at the end hero suddenly is no longer our hero - in a blink of an eye at the end of last episode hero is swapped for different person that completely changes situation - it was the only way to escape ending in style &quot;unhappiness and suffering forever and ever...&quot;, which combined with not comedic enough tone would be seriously awful...<br />
This comedy is also full of other things that a lot of people dislike (like repetitiveness, development stagnancy, constant screaming, inconsistency, lack reason for a lot of things - including standard hero who won&#039;t explain himself or situation) but such things happens very often in comedies and I&#039;m not so picky

    This anime will have you laughing hysterically. Seto no Hanayome is so far the funniest anime I have ever seen.<br />
<br />
The story of Seto no Hanayome begins with Nagasumi going on a trip to his grandmothers house. While there he drowns and is saved by a mermaid. The mermaid later appears on land and asks him to marry her. Later it turns out that the girls family is part of the Yakuza and by mermaid law if a mermaid saves a human that said mermaid has to die. However, there is a loophole that if Nagasumi marries Sun then she would not have to die because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review159173">
        Nagasumi is technically part of her family. So he proposes to Sun and the rest of the anime is just a series of running gags that will always make you laugh.<br />
<br />
The voice acting is great. Todd Haberkorn and Alexis Tipton are hilarious together in this show.<br />
<br />
The thing I like most about this show is its use of running gags like for example Shark Fujishiro always attempt to eat Nagasumi and Lunar&#039;s weird laugh that makes her eyes go in the opposite direction.<br />
<br />
My favorite character in this entire show is Sun&#039;s father he is just frickin&#039; funny the way he acts all tough, but when it comes to Sun he acts all cute and lovable towards his daughter.<br />
<br />
The main character&#039;s Nagasumi and Sun Seto have a great relationship and they are a great couple. There&#039;s also Lunar Edomae who is Sun&#039;s childhood friend who has this friendly rivalry that gets way out of control in this anime. Then there are the other characters that deserve mentioning like Chimp, Masa, Maki, Ren, Gozaburo, and Akeno.<br />
<br />
The best thing about this anime is its comedy and running gags. Oh, and I forgot to mention Lunar&#039;s father who is basically a terminator rip-off and has some of the funniest scenes in this show. Overall Seto no Hanayome is a show that will have you laughing over and over again in every episode and is definitely worth watching.
