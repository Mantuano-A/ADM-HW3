         This is a part of Nippon Animation&#039;s World Masterpiece Theatre, and I believe it to a masterpiece indeed. The story chronicles the life of an orphan girl named Jerusha &#039;Judy&#039; Abbot through her teen-aged years up to her young adulthood.<br />
     The many characters in this series truly have depth and are far from being one-dimensional - It is amazing that the writers can introduce such characters and without giving them hours upon hours of screen time are able to define their persona.  The feelings and opinions of Judy that is conveyed through her actions, interactions

        with other characters, narrations, and letters (she writes them a lot - like a journal) are very sincere but most of all original and this makes a very interesting main character and a very interesting series.<br />
     The animation itself is very good, showing a very early late eighties to early nineties style with beautiful frame-by-frame hand-drawn characters and watercolour backgrounds - none of that cheap cg you get nowadays.<br />
     This anime is not a kiddy anime, it is suitable for all ages and not only children but adults will enjoy it as well, and are sure to appreciate the more complex storyline.  This anime also slips in some nice americana and historical references in once in a while that is absent from the book (e.g. the first solo transatlantic flight by Charles Lindbergh on the Spirit of St. Louis in 1927).  This is truly a classic anime that is not to be missed, especially if you are as big an anime fan as I am!<br />
     Once you have seen the first episode, you are sure to continue on and follow Judy throughout her adventures from a child yearning to break free from the shackles of an orphanage and attend school; to her coming of age years when she discovers love and has her first crush; and in high-school where she develops ambitions of becoming a writer and a fully independent woman!

    Guys if your reading this, your probably wondering &quot;Should I watch this or not&quot;? Is this really worthy of my time, is it good enough for my liking?  If this is what&#039;s going around your head, then all I have to say is &quot;Just do it&quot;. This is my first time writing a review here in MAL and this show has amazed me. This show has influenced me in  ways I have never imagined. This show without a doubt is the best anime up to date. The first thing that got me interested about this show was the plot since it seems unique

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314731">
        and was adapted from a novel by Jean Webster. I love the characters development even tho it has 40 episodes long, it make me feel like I have growth along with the characters which makes me sad and happy at the same time. One thing to do while watching this show is grab a tissue box and enjoy the show.  I will never forget this show, as it&#039;s one of my most memorable anime I have ever seen. I want to thank the producers and ofcourse the author Jean Webster for an amazing job on this series. Much love :)

    This is an anime based off of a book, Daddy Long Legs, by Jean Webster. I&#039;m a really big fan of the book, and when I found out that someone made an anime of the book, of course I had to see it!<br />
All-in-all, it&#039;s a pretty decent anime... if you&#039;re a big fan of the book. Judy is a little obnoxious at the beginning of the series and the actual story doesn&#039;t get really good until right about episode... 25 or so, I guess. <br />
But, if you can sit through all of Judy&#039;s obnoxious, embarrassing situations, then it&#039;s completely worth it. Especially for the ending!

          <span style="display: none;" id="review62899">
        <br />
Also, having read the book, there were parts of the show that almost made it a comedy, because I knew already what was going on... but! Ah! Spoilers!<br />
<br />
To sum up... It&#039;s a decent enough older anime if you&#039;re a fan of the book. If you haven&#039;t read the book, go read it! Right now! And then come back and watch this anime!

    This series can be summed up as endearing and absolutely charming.<br />
<br />
While the plot differs some from the classic book (&quot;Daddy Long Legs&quot; by Jean Webster) on which it was based, &quot;My Daddy Long Legs&quot; is still a tender coming-of-age tale centered around the plucky orphan Judy Abbott, who is sent to a prestigious all-girls high school by a mysterious benefactor she dubs &#039;Daddy Long Legs&#039;.<br />
<br />
The story is set in early 20th century America--and I have to say I was impressed by how accurately this anime depicted the fashions, architecture, technology and experiences of this setting and time period.  If you like historical fiction, this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review71235">
        is a great show to pick.  This series is full of fun and (in the second half) romance.  Judy and her friends Sallie and Julia get into many scrapes during their three years of high school, but if you don&#039;t mind watching some awkward experiences natural to the growing-up process, you&#039;ll enjoy all the episodes, not just the romantic ones near the end.  <br />
<br />
All-in-all, this is a fantastic, accurate depiction of the educated female experience in 1910s-1920s America.  I plan on watching it again and again.

    My Daddy Long Legs is a World Masterpiece Theatre adaptation of the 1912 novel by Jean Webster. I first read the book when I was 18, at a friend&#039;s recommendation, then watched the anime adaptation afterwards. Just like many Nippon Animation adaptations that came before and after this one, it faithfully adapts all the good, the bad and the ugly from the source material, for better or for worse.<br />
<br />
I will begin with &quot;the good&quot;, as there truly is a lot of greatness in this story. The anime perfectly adapted everything that is so lovable and charming about the protagonist, Judy Abbott. She brightens up the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350430">
        lives of everyone around her and is a girl with a hidden talent for writing. An orphan thrown into the world of the upper class, we watch her grow as she navigates this alien world with wit and dignity. And though her friends and classmates seem stuck up and unlikable at first, they too change and grow as they learn to be more humble and kind like Judy. <br />
<br />
The world that Judy is surrounded by truly feels alive. This is also helped by the stunning art direction and strong sound direction. We watch the seasons change and the students of Lincoln Memorial School slowly physically age over the course of their education. The anime is filled with subtle and quiet moments where Judy will self reflect on her current situation with breathtaking background art and establishing shots of nature or the New York cityscape. As I watched these characters change I grew very attached to them all over again, only wishing for their happiness. However, as I knew the entire story already before starting the anime, the feeling of dread loomed over me knowing that under this easygoing slice-of-life, the problems that plagued the original novel were just as poignant here in it&#039;s on-screen adaptation. As they are problems rooted in the premise itself, there is very little even an excellent adaptation could fix. <br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s explore the elements which may be &quot;the bad&quot; to some. There are a lot of aspects of this anime and story with which many people will simply not resonate with. If you do not find Judy an enjoyable protagonist, the likelihood of you enjoying 40 episodes of her journey to adulthood is unlikely. The character design is very simplified; they don&#039;t appear very realistic and at times even resemble caricatures. The plots and twists were easy to follow even in the novel, since the source material was relatively short - this is even more so in the anime adaptation. It makes the plot easy to follow, but simultaneously it makes it predictable and many might find it boring or slow.<br />
<br />
By far the biggest change in this anime adaptation worth noting was the setting - while the novel begins with Judy Abott completing her university education with the assistance of her benefactor, in the anime this was changed to her entering high school. This was likely done to make the story more palatable to a younger and broader audience, as many anime under the World Masterpiece Theatre umbrella were produced in a similar manner. <br />
<br />
Finally, I would like to explore &quot;the ugly&quot;. In the case of Daddy Long Legs, the new high school setting has become a growing problem as the already complicated relationship between Judy and her guardian only grows worse when viewed through the lens of an adolescent girl. And though this was what always plagued the original novel, all these issues become significantly magnified the moment that Judy&#039;s age was changed and thus had a very negative effect on my enjoyment of this adaptation. The scenes that made me uncomfortable in the novel become borderline unbearable in the anime adaptation because of this one simple change. <br />
<br />
There is no way of putting this lightly - at its worst, the core of the plot revolves around a glorification of grooming. And as these issues were always there in the source material, perhaps it shows that this anime should have never been adapted as a shoujo story. A seinen or jousei direction and with the original university setting would make this a more faithful and slightly more palatable adaptation of the source material. As I continue to watch the anime it becomes more difficult to ignore its problems, despite the charming characters and anime production. By all means do watch it for yourself if you are intrigued but discretion is heavily advised.

    Hey folks looking for a recent review? here&#039;s one for 2020<br />
<br />
First of all it has aged really well. For something that was made back in 1990 it looks pretty good. No complaints with art or animation. <br />
<br />
As for the soundtrack the opening I like, the endings fine but I wouldn&#039;t want to listen to it too often. Music within the show I would say was was done pretty well nothing to be surprised about though. <br />
<br />
The characters are well written and their personalities shine through. The way the characters think and act are very precise to the time they are in, as least to my

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326487">
        belief. And as much as I might want to hate a character especially Julia I can&#039;t say they ever did something that was too out of character for them. Honestly there are times I get frustrated with the characters but I can appreciate that they have very realistic flaws that make them human. <br />
<br />
The story itself well as for this &quot;mysterious benefactor&quot; I don&#039;t think anything has been easier to guess. I&#039;s not bad but just wasn&#039;t expecting it to be &quot;that&quot; easy. <br />
<br />
I guess occasionally there is a little sexist comment about &quot;being more ladylike&quot; but it&#039;s understandable from that time. <br />
<br />
Now this is the part I hated most of all. I can&#039;t believe on one has said this yet but Judys romance is the absolute worst and if anyone actually thinks about it it is seriously messed up on so many levels. If you want to know more read all of it. <br />
<br />
SPOILERS JUST SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH (it&#039;s really important though)<br />
I&#039;m going to ignore the big age crush Julia has and instead go on about Judys. Now at the start I didn&#039;t hate it so much because he wasn&#039;t making any moves on the girl and it was just a simple one side crush Judy had because she didn&#039;t know. But he knew and never told her, even worst he even made moves on Judy. Dude you should know better. Not even considering the age gap he knew he was a dad figure to her in the letters she wrote. Ordering her to not be allowed to hang out with her finds to the point where she now considers the letters to be a sad obligation and wants to get rid of you to the point she feels she has no control over her life and wants to be fully independent. Yet he still shows up not telling her a thing instead still trying to get her to fall you knowing she doesn&#039;t know you are the person in the letters. He is full on manipulative. With letters he&#039;s marrying someone he knew and was financially supporting when she was 12. Without letter he&#039;s marrying someone who is young enough to be his daughter. Daughter or could have been daughter you tell me what&#039;s worst both are incredibly bad. <br />
<br />
If I had to pick something I really didn&#039;t like from the story it would be the part where Judy says &quot;finally became a normal girl&quot; and expresses how much she hates to go back to the orphanage. Now I get she isn&#039;t exactly proud of being an orphan but really during her time there you telling me there wasn&#039;t anyone she wanted to see, no bonds she made with anybody?? it just makes the first episode where they show how tough it was her to leave and how much she cared about the other children seemed useless. For good parts Judy letters do feel genuine and something I actually look forward to reading. <br />
<br />
If there is anything that I like about this show is that you see how the characters grow up from children to adults. When they are young and basically everything before ep 25 the show is kind of lighthearted and focus on relationships with friends and ordinary student life. As they start to grow up you can start to see (literally) the characters mature and interactions with others and their how topic of conversations start to change. It really feels as if you grown alongside with them. <br />
<br />
The show is enjoyable enough though (completely ignoring existence of the romance thing) and I do plan to finish all of it. If you can sit through 10 episodes that&#039;s basically the tone throughout the whole series.

    MY DADDY LONG LEGS:<br />
<br />
<br />
My Daddy Long Legs or Watashi no Ashinaga Ojisan as it is know is a 1990 anime based of the 1912 novel of the same name by Jean Webster. This is a part of Nippon Animation’s World Masterpiece Theatre which was a bunch of novels which were turned into anime by Nippon Animation. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
This anime follows Judy Abbott, a child from the John Grier orphanage. She was abandoned in the slums of New York as a baby and was taken in by the orphanage. She is forced to stay there for all of her pre-teen life. Until one day, Judy is selected

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205003">
        out of a possible four to go to the prestigious Lincoln Memorial High School in New Jersey by a mystery man. Judy never sees the face of this man however she does the shadows of this man. Due to his freakily long legs in the shadows, Judy affectionalty calls him “Daddy Long Legs”. She also has to write to him every month which is referred to in almost every episode.<br />
<br />
<br />
 It is at this school where we meet her friends, Sallie McBride and Julia Pendleton. There is also another roommate who comes in around episode 20 called Leonora Fenton, however she only lasts a couple of episodes as she is forced into Florida. This series lasts throughout the girl’s high school life, up until its graduation. I like how this is done as the older they get and the more they learn, the more mature they get. This is different from the novel as the novel is based in college. Throughout their time, relationships start to form and more characters start to form, Jervis Pendleton, Julia’s cousin who Julia does not like at the beginning however Judy falls in love with him since he is not your “typical rich person”, Jimmie McBride, Sallie’s brother who is a Quarterback at Princeton University who falls in love with Judy however Julia also develops feelings for him (even going as far to learn American Football), and Bob, Jimmie’s friend and captain of the football team who Sallie also develops some feelings for (however since they are both awkward, this does not really end anywhere). There are also some minor characters introduced who really do not do much in order to me to really talk about them.<br />
 <br />
<br />
The last 15 episodes or so changes the story up a bit since Judy wishes to become more independent. This leads to her arguing with “Daddy Long Legs” and disobeying things by taking jobs despite Daddy telling her not to. She also is taken to a Farm against her wishes (this is most likely set up by Daddy Long Legs since some story plots take place here which may ruin the entire series if I tell them here). Despite this, Judy finally makes up with Daddy. Judy is asked to deliver a speech for the graduating students, Daddy even promises to show up, however he gets very sick and eventually, Judy has to go out and find him. It is here where finally, Daddy Long Legs is revealed. <br />
<br />
<br />
I rate this story an 8/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Judy: I actually like Judy quite a lot. I do find her to be quite a sympathetic  character. I do think she should have listened to her father a lot more during the last arc however I do understand her position based on her lifestyle and the fact that she has never allowed to experience true freedom before. I was cheering for her all throughout this series. She does grow up in maturity as well the teachers at the school (mostly the English one), her friends and especially Daddy Long Legs teach her about the world around her and how to act in situations. She was definitely the best character in the show as a show based around her should be.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sallie: She is the nice, kind and helpful friend to Judy. She has some quirks like her anxiety to public speaking however for me she was a little too bland. She really does not develop that much which is mostly due to the fact that there really is not many situations that you can develop her. Still, she is not a bad character by any means and won’t make you want to skip forward or anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
Julia:  She starts out as the snobby rich character who starts of as friends with Sallie however Judy doesn&#039;t like her. She does however get the 2nd most amount of development behind Judy (Around the time she meets Jimmie is where it really starts) and she does start to get friendlier with Judy. Furthermore, when you see her parents, it does become evident why Julia is not really happy with her life since her parents are absolute shitheads. I did really start to feel sorry for her at the end.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jervis: I did like him, however he really didn&#039;t offer much in terms of personality. He is the friendly, goofy guy in the series. I also find it a bit weird how he straight up falls in love with a minor even though he is about 30 however it does make more sense at the end of the series (It is a pretty massive spoiler). Still a pretty good character though as you do really feel his love for Judy<br />
<br />
<br />
Jimmie: Again likeable, however not given to much development other than his relationships with Judy and Julia. Does seem to be a nice guy, even though he blatantly ignores Julia’s feelings for him because of his feelings with Judy.<br />
<br />
<br />
The other characters are really not given enough screen time or development for me to really comment on them too much.<br />
<br />
<br />
I rate these characters a 7.5/10<br />
<br />
Art<br />
<br />
I love the art. Not because of the actual art style or quality since it is good for the time but not specular. What really gets me is the fact that they ACTUALLY manage to make the characters grow. Not from teenager to adult or kid to teenager but year to year, the 3 girls actually do grow in height. This is especially noticeable from flashbacks. I believe not enough anime that last years have this sort of continuous physical growth and that this should be more prevalent. I did have a few problems with the art/animation (especially those basketball scenes) however they are not really noticeable enough to ruin this series<br />
<br />
I rate the art at an 8.5/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
<br />
<br />
I like this anime quite a bit. It is not the best series out there I’ll admit however if you are looking a good lengthy show or perhaps an older style show then this would be a good one to watch. Your views may be different in terms of how you feel of the characters or story however I do believe this is suitable for pretty much everyone.<br />
<br />
I give the series an overall rating of 8/10<br />

    One of my favorite childhood memories٫ I rewatched it again and it was just sweet as I remember, the characters and the connections between them is just great and the story about the main character how it started like when she was a kid and in the end she was a grown woman it is just like i lived with her, day by day and just felt her pain her happiness and her every thing and i just love it, in the end I just start to miss the little girl of her she was so joyful as an orphan girl her life changed so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339571">
        much and I felt that change, as a story it is just so sweet, about the drawing for an old anime like this is not bad at all, I really enjoyed watching it again it reminds me of the old sweet days it made me feel happy sad and everything.

    I like how it is done in nippon anime adaptation ,the musical and portrayals of the main cast are awesome. I have read the original novel written by jean webster and it is quit different thought it is given to have variations.. everything on it is perfect for me.. the love story of judy and jervie at the end was great though am rooting for the sequel that my dear enemy ,. i hope nippon will give it a try.. which was also a best selling novel.<br />
<br />
<br />
The chracters are well portrayed. The story telling in the story how judy communicate to DLL is achieved. <br />
<br />
<br />

    Dear Mr/Ms.Reader,<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope you are in good health and doing great in life. I’m doing good in life.<br />
<br />
Recently I watched an anime from 1990 called My Daddy Long Legs which is based on a novel from 1912 which I would like to talk about with you. I really enjoyed a whole lot out of it but there were things which troubled me. If I can describe this anime with a single word it would be wholesome, so I will try to organize the rest of the letter as a review for you dear reader. Sadly I&#039;m forced to give a score to the anime in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review398281">
        the review , so that the letter can reach you but I hope it will be a fun read.<br />
<br />
Once upon time , there was a lovely orphan (which is typical for world masterpiece theater anime adaptations) called Judy. She is cheerful , playful , clumsy and good hearted in nature.  She isn’t perfect by any means but this is for later. She was trapped in an orphanage where she used to work and take care of children. She needed salvation. Her writings were the trigger for her way to salvation.  On a stormy night , Mr John Smith in his 20th century car came for the rescue. He used his trusted cash, a lot of dollars like a sword of a knight to free Judy from her chains by offering her a fund  to study at prestigious high school but in return, Judy must write a letter for him at least once every month about her life. I was also looking forward to hearing the letter narrated by her. Judy only saw the shadow of John Smith when he was leaving. The shadow casted amplified how long his legs are , thus Judy named him Daddy Long Legs (also the name of an arachnid). This act of heroism and kindness is attributed to a solo person called John Smith rather than a committee, thus he becomes a father figure to the lonely orphan Judy. <br />
<br />
<br />
This is how the story of the anime began my dear reader. The anime is a comedy slice of life of a lovely insecure orphan in a prestigious high school where girls from prestigious families came to learn. The story takes on a lighthearted tone. There are no mean people but only concerned people and some petty disputes which can be solved by just some simple confidence in oneself and sincere apology  (This includes Julia’s mother if you think about it). I liked how most of the conflicts are due to some fault in the characters rather than being pushed from the outside.  Judy gains friends in her high school life : Sally McBride a shy girl who can’t attempt to hurt a fly and Julia Pendleton a prideful snob from a wealthy family as if she is an aristocrat. I usually don&#039;t like Julia&#039;s archetype but the story will sell her up to you. I find how she tries to minimize the contact surface area between her and the hotdog when she was forced to eat using her bare hands to be adorable and Julia isn’t a bully. The story has a very good pacing if you are looking for a school slice of life anime where the characters get mature with time figuratively and literally. There are some events about how Judy tries to face her insecurity of being an orphan and hide this fact. She is also a very fragile character to criticism because she didn’t face one from someone she cares about in the past. The character interactions filled me with wholesomeness and laughter but It also filled me with sympathy. Judy’s relation with Mr John Smith has also developed with the events, till Judy tries to be independent. <br />
<br />
<br />
While there is nothing to write home about for the music in the anime , I enjoyed the use of the main character voice actor in the opening and ending sequence. I always find it charming and it makes the songs more personalized for the anime. I can understand if the art will feel outdated to some people but there is a charm to watching an old anime  because the color scheme used isn’t replicated in modern anime and It is still impressive to see New York in anime with historical genre. I also liked the effort put into character clothing. The characters are in a lot of different clothes for different situations.  It is hard to imagine an anime about girls (especially from rich families) without them having many different clothes.      <br />
<br />
<br />
Those attributes can create a fun show but those things can be considered a norm for a good coming of age story. Wait, there are things which really differentiate this anime from others in good and bad ways. I will begin with the good one: <br />
<br />
<br />
The anime really shows a  perspective into the orphan mentality and their life. I used to visit orphanages with my family in the past and I remember my mother&#039;s commands of what to do in the orphanage. A proper way to communicate the act of kindness can prevent harm to those children&#039;s mentality. The world is a harsh place but a wealthy enough parents/family can shield their children from it but for the orphans , the need for money to support them can mean the need for drastic measures.<br />
<br />
Then there is the thing which I didn’t like. There will be spoilers , so this is a warning for you dear reader : <br />
<br />
I’m not really a romantic person , so keep this in mind. The story doesn’t really hide that Jarvis is John Smith. Judy and Jarvis would fall in love and marry in the end. I know that the anime setting is based on the beginning of the 20th century where girls would get engaged at an early age like 15 or 16. College education wasn’t viewed as being necessary for girls but it gave them prestige but still Judy’s love can be viewed or seen as a 13/14 years old having a crush on an older handsome man who has a gap of 13 years between them. There are some people who marry each other with such an age gap but It is often when both parties are well established adults.  She writes her feelings and days to John Smith , who she views as a father figure and Jarvis ,who also falls in love with Judy as well, gets to know information about her but not the other way around. It triggers a cynical voice in my mind of how manipulative the situation is. This dual nature of a character can easily prey on her if the person is nasty. Jarvis&#039; reason to not reveal the truth is because he was afraid to lose the sense of love.  In one of the summers , John Smith (Jarvis) forced Judy to go to a farm rather than with her friends and  Jimmy McBride.  You can say that he wanted her to focus on writing short novels but when you listen to Jarvis talking to Judy , you can sense the voice of jealousy , as if his order as John Smith was to distance Judy from Jimmy. She already turned Jimmy down. There were moments that probably solidified Judy’s sense of love for Jarvis which depended on Jarvis telling Judy what she needed at a time from reading her letters. If this doesn’t sound manipulative even for a good intention, I’m not sure what to call it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Happily, the story tries to solidify the idea that Judy loves Jarvis for his non-financial merits.  I agree that it succeeds slightly with that. Having also the real identity of John Smith hidden from Judy helped in escaping a catastrophic unintentional message that the story can give. It would be devastating to view the relationship between them as a sugar daddy one. I personally don’t recommend young girls to watch this anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
What do you think my dear reader of this anime and my review ? I hope you are doing great and having fun. I’m looking forward to reading your replies. Please #StaySafe.<br />

Yours truly<br />

    Hello. I recommend watching it but I didn&#039;t like it. <br />
<br />
What I thought about Watashi no Ashinaga Ojisan-<br />
1. The start was interesting. <br />
2. There were many interesting and different characters that made the story very colorful and interesting. <br />
3. Like many other people I watched it because of Daddy Long Legs, it was a truly good character that I had never seen before. <br />
4. But, maybe it&#039;s my own option and many might disagree but it was really lacking. <br />
First of all, the story was slightly getting boring and started to get hard to watch. <br />
Most of the things were easy to predict and I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review400150">
        didn&#039;t like them. <br />
The main character in my opinion was slightly annoying and stupid, there were many times I wanted to drop it but continued because of my favorite character. (Daddy Long Legs.)<br />
Secondly, I was disappointed. I don&#039;t want to spoil but what I can say there were many characters that were far from realistic and I really didn&#039;t like them. <br />
5. As for the last point what I wanted to tell you, maybe it&#039;s once again only my option and maybe it&#039;s because of my for sure big expectations but the end was HORRIBLE. I absolutely hated it. It was one of the biggest disappointments in my life. <br />
No spoilers again. <br />
But what I wanted to tell is that if the ending was different I would have put it as one of my favorites but after watching it until the end I feel very sad and angry. <br />
Thank you for reading and sorry if this wasn&#039;t helpful or misleading.
