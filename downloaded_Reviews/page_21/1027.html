Omatsuri Danshaku to Himitsu no Shima (Baron Omatsuri and the Secret Island) is the sixth One Piece movie and differs in many aspects to the series in terms of animation, sound and character. I have to say now &amp;ndash; if you like One Piece for it&amp;rsquo;s fighting &amp;ndash; look elsewhere, this film is all about adding depth to the emotional bonds of the crew, which is picked upon during major arcs in the series, and how important nakama are to everyone. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story.<br />
Whilst sailing the Grand Line the Mugiwara pirates come upon a message in a bottle, advertising Omatsuri Island (Festival Island), a pirate paradise. But

          <span style="display: none;" id="review12392">
        when the crew reach the island eager to kick back and relax, they are propositioned to go through &amp;lsquo;Ordeals&amp;rsquo; (much like the Skypiea arc) that are all based on Japanese festival games (goldfish catching etc). Luffy, forever positive, is happy to participate in the &amp;lsquo;games&amp;rsquo; while the rest of the crew slowly start to fall apart. Compared to the series, this movie is much more mysterious and, at times, even unsettling, especially towards the end when everything becomes desperate. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave the Story at that, not wanting to spoil anything. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Animation.<br />
I noticed the art straight away and it first I thought it was just for the opening, but it stays throughout the whole anime and fits perfectly for the more serious tone. The characters are still drawn the same way, but there isn&amp;rsquo;t any cell-shading (y&amp;rsquo;know that band of light anime characters get across their hair? Yeah, there&amp;rsquo;s none of that), it gives a more &amp;lsquo;flat&amp;rsquo; and simple look. <br />
<br />
Computer animation is also used quite a lot (backgrounds, weapons, plants, goldfish..), especially when they first arrive in the island and are moving through the jungle. It jarred me at first, but eventually I started to like the 2-D characters against a computer animated 3-D background, it some ways it made up for the lack of colour the characters had. <br />
<br />
There are also other things in this movie which you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t find in the series: a First Person Perspective &amp;ndash; there are a lot of times where you hear dialogue but you don&amp;rsquo;t see our characters. Sanji also breaks the fourth wall a few times (turning to the viewer and speaking to them) early on. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound.<br />
Where do I begin? I think after the art, the sound is something easily noticed. I cannot express how much I adored how the sound was used in this film, rather the background music or lack thereof. During the opening, there&amp;rsquo;s some steel drums and very &amp;lsquo;Caribbean&amp;rsquo; music &amp;ndash; highlighting the fact that the Mugiwaras are heading to a paradisiacal island (this actually reminded me of a certain Disney movie &amp;not;_&amp;not;). <br />
<br />
I can&amp;rsquo;t really remember any distinct scores of music in the film, but that&amp;rsquo;s probably because there are massive gaps of silence in the music. I loved it. It&amp;rsquo;s common that during a film we&amp;rsquo;re subconsciously affected by the soundtrack, it&amp;rsquo;s even more common that we can&amp;rsquo;t remember things like background music unless it&amp;rsquo;s highlighted. In this film, the lack of music really works; it makes us focus our attention on the characters and their expressions, their emotions and conversations. Often, the camera would be fixed on a character for a number of seconds with no dialogue or music, and even no real animation. It can feel a bit strange at times because you end up thinking to yourself &amp;ldquo;It would be more interesting if they were actually doing something&amp;rdquo; but looking back it enhances the overall style and feel of the movie. <br />
<br />
As usual, the seiyuus of One Piece are brilliant.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Character.<br />
This is probably the most important aspect of the movie, as in most movies that are based off a series; you need to be able to introduce your characters effectively for the familiar and unfamiliar audience. Within the first five minutes, we are shown all of the main characters personalities and desires quickly, whether it be Sanji&amp;rsquo;s affection for beautiful women or Nami&amp;rsquo;s for luxuries, Usopp&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;cautiousness&amp;rsquo; or Zoro&amp;rsquo;s aloofness. For an unfamiliar viewer it helps you understand who these characters are, and their motives, for the familiar viewer, it&amp;rsquo;s fun to see the characters basic urges being poked fun of. <br />
<br />
I&amp;rsquo;d say through the film we see (without trying to spoil anything) a different side of the characters, or at least in their attitude towards each other. Misunderstandings occur, arguments happen, crew members go missing and suddenly everyone&amp;rsquo;s fighting with each other. If, like me, when you watch One Piece&amp;rsquo;s emotional scenes (the character&amp;rsquo;s pasts, Luffy and Usopps fight etc) you actually feel for the characters, you cheer Luffy on, and when your favourite is beaten, you feel beaten too, this movie will get to you. The sight of the main characters drifting apart is painful and you think &amp;ldquo;What are doing you idiots? You&amp;rsquo;re nakama!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; that is the key to this whole film.<br />
<br />
To touch upon the new characters that are solely in this film, they all have their own charm &amp;ndash; I found Brief endearing and funny, the Tearoom pirates, despite their smaller amount of screen time, managed to have their own story and a family dynamic. Finally, Baron Omatsuri and the rest of the Island&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants are probably the most difficult characters to talk about. Personally, I probably felt more pity for them than anything else, despite the Baron being the &amp;lsquo;villain&amp;rsquo;. Characters like Muchigoro and DJ had the strange ability to invoke fear and sympathy at the time, I found it hard to completely dislike them even though they were the enemy. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment.<br />
Briefly, everything I love about One Piece was in this movie &amp;ndash; the characters, the humour and the usual emotional nakama-related plot. If you enjoy One Piece for the same reasons, I highly recommend you watch this. I would even perhaps recommend this to people who haven&amp;rsquo;t watched the series, but I doubt it would have the same impact as it would for fans.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading, please feel free to send me any feedback etc.<br />

    At first when I saw this I was suprised, mainly because the art style was so different, it was anyhting but original one piece style, it was really different, the animators mixed in CG and 2d together into this movie, and I felt they did a brilliant job,.<br />
<br />
The story and the setting and even the personality of the characters really help to set in the art style. and it really does help to show how the characters reactions and feelings begin to shift in the story.<br />
<br />
The story was weird at first, but it almost immediately begins to make sense.<br />
<br />
the action in this movie was decent

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14886">
        and very enjoyable, especially the finale, which I really enjoyed, that scene just engraved itself into my head.<br />
<br />
OVerall the story was more of a ghost tale, but at the same time it also held a important message of freindship. which I also enjoyed. the voice acting was brilliantly done as usaul, and the character were well thought out.<br />
<br />
Overall I enjoyed this movie, more then some of the other one piece movie releases mainly because of the difference in the style and maybe due to the story itself, either way I really enjoyed it and have found my self rewatching it for more then 7 times.

    Hungry for some One Piece with a little twist? Look no further, because here it is.<br />
<br />
On one hand I quite liked the story. The Strawhats, as always, are out on an adventure. It is wacky, funny with some slapstick and the good old jokes. <br />
On the other hand the story is different from the usual One Piece we know, this is both good and bad as the story becomes interesting, but I will try to write them in a list.<br />
<br />
Good points:<br />
- You do not know what exactly to expect to happen, so the plot twist is more satisfying<br />
- The usual deal about a bad guy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180852">
        who needs to be beaten is not all this story is about<br />
- The Straw Hats are seen in a desperate situation which test their relationship to one another<br />
- the plot twist also makes the movie seem like another movie altogether. The tone, so to say, change drastically and magnificently.<br />
<br />
Bad points:<br />
- Plot holes. In the end this alternative story is indeed refreshing, but it does leave some things unexplained.<br />
- After the first initial start of the movie I found the pace to be slow for a while. However I believe it is because of the mystery presented in the movie and the viewer is left question what direction the movie is going into<br />
- The internal struggle which the Straw Hats goes through is not resolved. It simply disappears, which I find to be a huge letdown and it also reflect my Character score <br />
<br />
The art is wholly different from the standard One Piece art, but this is not necessarily bad, I just find it to be bad in this case. Both the background and the characters, especially the expression on the crews faces is different.<br />
Much of the story has buildings in its background, and those are amazing to look at. The things is though, that they are too different from the characters design, it just does not mix well together, at times it looks as if the characters has been plastered on.<br />
The expressions  and characters designs seen one the crew is refreshing. The expressions seem more cartoonish to me, a big plus. <br />
<br />
The music used is a mix of the standard from the series and and some original mixed together, they mix okay together. The voice actors also do a pretty good job. In short I found the sound to be the most satisfying in the movie.<br />
<br />
The characters could have shined in this movie, but ultimately failed to do so. The movie put the Straw Hats up against each other, but fail to do it trustworthily, as they act out of character and the conflict is never resolved, it simply disappears. <br />
<br />
All in all this movie has it shortcomings, but it does not fully take my joy from watching this movie. It was  pleasing to see a different story, even if it did not fully do its job.

    Please read further at your own risk since this review contains SPOILERS.<br />
Also. my memory’s a bit hazy since watched this movie a little over 2 weeks ago, so please correct me if I’m mistaken in any part.<br />
<br />
At the time of writing this review, I have not watched the top 2 rated One Piece Movies (One Piece Strong World and Film Z). Hence I’ll claim this movie to be my favorite movie amongst the One Piece movies so far because others have their eyes on adventure as the main theme, which for me is average. When I first saw the cover of this movie on MAL,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review211656">
        I was sure that it would be really crappy. I was also surprised to see how high this movie is rated compared to other OP Movies. But as the mainstream saying goes, “Don’t judge a book by its cover”.<br />
<br />
One Piece has always been known for its adventurous world, light hearted comedy (which sometimes isn’t funny) and its focus on friendship between the crewmates. This movie takes it one step further in terms of friendship between the crew. It does have a few plot-holes though.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
To begin with, the movie starts out pretty average as you have the Straw Hats sailing the sea and finding a mysterious island. On the island they meet the island inhabitants and are put through a series of games to determine if they get to stay on the island. That’s all I can describe about the introduction.<br />
Midway, chopper separates from the crew as he isn’t participating in the games. He meets a father and his daughters who tell him that Baron’s (King-ish person of the island) main goal is to separate and destroy the friendship among pirate crews. Baron spies on them and shoots Chopper with a tranquilizer which causes him to lose consciousness.<br />
Meanwhile Zoro + Sanji and Nami + Ussop compete against Baron’s friends in the games. If you watch One Piece, you know that Zoro and Sanji never get along. Nami and Ussop also get tricked by the competitors when they set up Ussop so that Nami thinks that he betrayed her.<br />
This movie is the outlier amongst other One Piece movies as the story’s core focus isn’t adventure this time around. Instead, this story touches a deeper topic, which is the bonds between the Straw Hat Crew. From my point of view, I felt like the story was very dark and has a sense of true mystery in it.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
The movie begins with below average animation and deformed characters in some frames (almost like the animation in OP Chopper Special, but tad bit better). The character outlines are very thin, and the colors used are a little darker. It appeals as a comedic movie in a sense actually. But as it progresses, you’ll start to understand why they used this kind of animation. One of the last scenes especially was very well done, where the flower on Baron’s shoulder transforms into this gruesome thing.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
No comments about the music since I can’t seem to recall it.<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
The focus on characters was intense in this one. It also tells you about Nami’s nature, because she refuses to let Ussop talk and explain himself (that he was set up by Baron). Ussop inturn also gets upset with her and stops talking to her. Zoro and Sanji, fiesty as always against each other. These four, thinking about each other’s betrayal, also get aggressive with Luffy when he tries to council and talk to them. Robin and Chopper were solo and got abducted, so nothing to elaborate on about them.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
In the end, you get a great fight, Luffy vs Baron. The fighting sequence is very well done and is really immersive.<br />
I absolutely loved the nature of this movie. It’s quite dark-themed, mysterious and focuses on a sensitive topic. I’d recommend this movie to OP fans looking for something a little different from the other OP movies.

    Forgive me for I have not caught up far enough in the anime to watch Strong World, but for a moment lets imagine that I&#039;m a person watching this movie when it was released to the public. Up to this point there have only been 5 One Piece movies. The first 3 are good for the most part, and then once Nico Robin joined the Straw Hats the qualities of the movie went up significantly. You then hear that the sixth One Piece movie will be different and under a new team. The die hard purist are screaming, &quot;WHAT!? HOW DARE THEY!? THEY CAN&#039;T JUST

          <span style="display: none;" id="review47803">
        DO THAT TO ONE PIECE!&quot; Then you hear that the director is Mamoru Hosoda, who at the time was only known for the Digimon Movie. Today, people would be freaking out hearing this going, &quot;The guy who did Summer Wars and The Girl who Leapt Through Time did a One Piece movie?&quot; Yes, yes he did and the final verdict: Mamoru Hosoda should do it again because for me this is the best One Piece movie I have seen yet.<br />
<br />
Right from the beginning, you know that this movie is going to be unlike anything One Piece has ever done before because this is not traditional One Piece animation. Instead, it has the more gritty animation that we know Hosoda for today. However, even with the gritty animation, this movie is still the colorful One Piece that we all know and love. It&#039;s expected though, it&#039;s a movie therefore I expect a big budget to come out of it. Therefore, everything is detailed down to the wind blowing into Nami&#039;s gorgeous red hair. What&#039;s even nicer is that later this movie get very offbeat and probably the darkest I have ever seen One Piece ever be. Visually, the movie is perfect and makes me begs the question: Should One Piece be animated like this for rest of the franchise?<br />
<br />
Audio-wise, there&#039;s not much really to say. It&#039;s the same great voice acting from the Japanese track of the show so not much to say. Though, why Funimation dubbed the unnecessary and pointless recap movie and not this or any of the other movies for that matter just boggles me. The score is also pretty good with the orchestrated piece that you expect to hear from the One Piece franchise. So yeah, audio is pretty good.<br />
<br />
So if you are reading this review then chances are you are probably a huge One Piece fan like I am and want to know which of movies you should watch. Well here&#039;s the thing, you can actually watch this movie right after Nico Robin joins the Straw Hats (actually I recommend movie 4 first, but you can skip over 5, and go right to this one, then watch 5 after). So what is the plot of this movie exactly? Well, The Straw Hats come across a resort island and decide to anchor for a little R&amp;R. However, the owner of the island, Baron Omatsuri, tells them that staying on the island is not as simple as it sounds as they have to partake in...THE ORDEAL OF HELL DUN! DUN! DUN!...yeah I know it sounds silly but remember this is One Piece, a show that perfectly blends childish antics with adult themes, and this movie exemplifies that here as well.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s hard to talk about this movie without spoiling anything but here&#039;s what I love about this movie that makes it the best of the One Piece films I&#039;ve seen so far: The character relationships. At this point, the Straw Hats are a family and despite how much they get each other&#039;s nerves, they still care for each other to the point where they save each other&#039;s hide through thick and through thin (It&#039;s the lyrics to the to first theme for Pete&#039;s sake). Luffy even says, not exactly of course, to the others, when they are looking at him crazy for accepting the terms of the challenge that basically &quot;Listen, we can do this, we have been through worst shit before and survived, we can do this, I trust you.&quot; It was at that point that I realized that I was going to like this movie a lot and understand where the movie was headed. It is then later in the movie, that we see all the characters have one instance where they conflict with each other. However, there is one problem with the movie that I do want to address. While I do love these character relationships, the ending never resolves them that well, and doesn&#039;t really show what happened. Did Zoro apologize to Sanji for his lack of support? Did Nami talk to Usopp again right after? Why didn&#039;t we see Robin and Chopper ever have a moment? So many questions! However, I don&#039;t mind because we all know that in the end that the Straw Hats will be the Straw Hats.<br />
<br />
Overall, really check out this movie. It shows what One Piece excels at the most: Great Characters and the bonds that occur between them. If it&#039;s not to much to ask, I would love this see movie brought to the states and dubbed nonetheless. Especially considering the animation is fantastic and the story telling is above par and probably one of the darkest that One Piece has ever gotten. Now if you&#039;ll excuse me, I&#039;m going to see if I can find a pirate crew just as cool as the Straw Hats.

    I saw this movie expecting it to be great. It&#039;s often considered the second best One Piece movie, and that left expectations of greatness. What I found was a disappointing mess. <br />
<br />
Art - The different style of this movie was refreshing, and interesting, but at points felt static, rather than dynamic. At many points, rather than looking like a world with depth, the scenes felt like cut outs, the characters were only pretending to interact with. Still, this was a decent, and interesting play around, and it certainly wasn&#039;t bad.<br />
<br />
Sound - Decent. Not my area.<br />
<br />
Character - The characters are, more or less, those we&#039;ve come

          <span style="display: none;" id="review80528">
        to love. They were slightly misused in the film, but were same old good. The new characters were also, in some regards powerful, particularly Sir mustache.<br />
<br />
Story - Oh, the story. This film was basically an attempt at character-expression. The story was mostly just a framework to give a message of friendship, but it was so terrible done. Most of the movie felt pointless at the end. I had no idea why certain things were going on, as they lacked any reasoning, or explanation in the narrative. Overall, it felt like they were banking on the characters, but they were misused to hammer home a message that doesn&#039;t fit, and doesn&#039;t even work that well with the story given. A lot of characters are essentially scenery given too much detail.<br />
<br />
So, if you want to watch &#039;em all, see it. If you&#039;re more interested in whether it&#039;s a good film, I&#039;d give it a miss.

    One Piece Movie 6:  Omatsuri Danshaku to Himitsu no Shima Review<br />
<br />
<br />
Story (7/10)<br />
More Specifically (7.5/10)<br />
<br />
The story for the 6th movie of One Piece is definitely different as the first half is probably the most light hearted environment you&#039;ll see in any of the One Piece movies and the second half is probably one of the IF NOT THE darkest environment/setting you&#039;ll see in all of One Piece (Anime/Manga/Movie). It&#039;s different which is interesting the first half was enjoying for a while and right around the time where you would start to feel this is getting old that&#039;s when it switches on you and shows you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review209638">
        that this isn&#039;t what you think it is. I thought the story was good and nice change of things once and a while isn&#039;t a bad thing and I think this movie did it well. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art and Animation (7/10) <br />
More Specifically (7.5/10)<br />
<br />
Now going into the movie you can tell that the art and animation is different, just like this movie&#039;s plot setting and twist it takes a different twist to this and brings in key animators Hiroyuki Imaishi and You Yoshinari which are known for there Kill La Kill, FLCL and Gurren Laggan Gainax art style and animation to the table. It&#039;s interesting to see how One Piece characters fit with their art style and animation slapped onto it. I&#039;m not a huge fan of how their stuff looks and moves but I do appreciate it because it&#039;s definitely not bad I just don&#039;t think it&#039;s amazing. Not a huge fan of the semi-boney look that character have to their body structure which comes along with their art style on most characters but that&#039;s just an opinionated statement obviously. Like I said it isn&#039;t bad I&#039;m just not a fan and I do think it&#039;s cool that they were allowed to influence this one because like I said earlier about this movie&#039;s story and plot setting it brings something different to the table so this on top of that assist that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound (8/10) <br />
<br />
The BGM I thought fit a lot of scenes in this movie during both it&#039;s light hearted and creepy parts of the movie I thought it fit well, actually more than well and the outro music was quite good also.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters (7/10)  <br />
More Specifically (7.5/10)<br />
<br />
The Straw Hat crew in the start of the movie are all active and doing their thing which is what I like to see it&#039;s not really focusing on the movie MC that much but enough to know what he and his children where about and keeping them semi-relevant through out the movie without making them feel like they were wasting screen time which I thought were major issues in previous One Piece movies. Even though in the second half of the movie (the creepy side) all of the straw hat crew hit the backburner the movie MC stayed relevant helping Luffy make a comeback twice and wrapping up the movie quite well so I wasn&#039;t blown away but I am indeed pleased.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (7/10) <br />
<br />
I enjoyed the first quarter of the movie, I felt a little bored during the second quarter because I felt the light hearted stuff got old a little quick there&#039;s only so much goofy scenes I can endure before I get bored (especially in movie format). The second half of the movie saved the movie for me bringing an atmosphere we&#039;ve never seen before to One Piece and I was fairly interesting and paying full attention during the second half, like I said before nothing mind blowing but I am indeed satisfied for bring something somewhat unique to the table for this movie.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall (7/10) <br />
More Specifically (7.50/10)<br />
<br />
The 6th movie brought it back because I was getting tired of seeing semi-boring One Piece movies this one was somewhat of a treat.

    One Piece has always been known for its festive atmosphere, its wacky characters and the strong bonds that tie the main cast, the Straw Hats, together: the bonds of &quot;nakama.&quot; Even in all of its non-canon OVAs and movies, these qualities are present and what mold the story in every title belonging to the franchise. There is one movie however that flips over these elements. Yes, I hated and never enjoyed this movie the first time I watched it just because it was not the typical One Piece and I felt stressed about the events in it. It took me courage just to rewatch it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review191214">
        and appreciate what it tried to show. And I will simply declare that this sixth movie is gloomy, unpleasant and horrifying.<br />
<br />
(MINOR SPOILERS)<br />
<br />
Directed by Mamoru Hosoda (The Girl Who Leapt Through Time), Baron Omatsuri and the Secret Island tells the story of the Straw Hats&#039; sidetrack visit to a vacation island owned by Baron Omatsuri, where it offers many great pleasures, good for relaxing from a grand journey. There is a catch, and that is they have to overcome the challenges given by the Baron to experience these pleasures. As Luffy and his crew continue to compete in these challenges, slowly they discover the dark secrets of the Baron and the island and while this happens, the crew&#039;s relationship gradually fall apart which makes them more vulnerable to the incoming adversities.<br />
<br />
Just from the early minutes of the movie it is very obvious that the animation style is different. For first time viewers it looks weird with the evident dull coloring, lack of variety of shading and dimension and whatnot in contrast to the anime series&#039; bright visuals. It still has the silly character designs for the non-Straw Hats, except for a few which resulted in some of the most frightening images associated with the entire franchise. For those familiar with Hosoda&#039;s other works, it is easy to get used to and you may even notice some angles or shots unique to him. Either way, the visuals work well with what the movie tries to do: a more serious approach on One Piece. Watch as the dull colors eat away at least one-third of the film&#039;s duration and you will feel the heavy atmosphere taking over what lightheartedness you know about One Piece.<br />
<br />
The only complaint I have is the CGI. Most of the time, they do not mesh well with this movie&#039;s 2D animation. The film swapped the series&#039; time-tested background art with full CGI (imagine a CG tropical island/forest as the setting). And it happens at the early stages of the movie which can only increase the possible disgust the audience has for the animation style alone.<br />
<br />
Despite how much I said it gets heavier as it progresses, the early minutes exudes with the typical One Piece slapstick humor. Character introductions are being done by this point to help us again familiarize the Straw Hats. But as the conflict slowly arises, all that energy fades away too little by little. The story is also not the same for other OP titles, with one example in which the main cast does not approach the conflict but instead the conflict approaches the main cast.<br />
<br />
Unlike other OP titles, the story moves because of the characters, not because the plot demands so. And thanks to the animation style, the storytelling is greatly enhanced. It adds mystery to the narrative that fits perfectly and just flows naturally. And with mystery comes the plot twists. They may not be among the best, but these twists were properly built upon with the few hints thrown throughout the entire duration of the film that makes the biggest reveal satisfying.<br />
<br />
As I said earlier, this movie flips over some One Piece elements, and one of them is the friendship theme. The movie adds several possibilities to the Straw Hats&#039; relationship concerning their situation in the film (when experiencing great, unexpected pressure), that there are times fights occur despite how strong the bond is forged, and trust can be hard to build again when these bonds are shattered.<br />
<br />
The common criticism the movie gets is how the Straw Hats are out of character thanks to how they are portrayed. I have to disagree with that. The movie thinks like “how would we react to each of the Straw Hats&#039; personalities in real life?” or along those lines.<br />
<br />
*SPOILER*<br />
The best example would be the comical Nami-Usopp relationship. Aside from being greedy, canon Nami can be bold but bossy. And canon Usopp, despite being a liar, is frank about other people&#039;s negative points. Now what would happen if these two personalities clashed in a realistic way, minus all the comedy and fun attached to it?<br />
*END OF SPOILER*<br />
<br />
What I am trying to say is the movie only adds a new perspective to their character, not completely destroying it. These new perspectives really give you a feeling that this crew may be just one step away from disbanding.<br />
<br />
There are other things to look out for. If you have been watching this the intended order, you get to see one of the earliest moments Luffy&#039;s leadership being challenged by his crew. As for the villain, Baron Omatsuri is the typical bitter villain who wishes for others to suffer the same fate as him, but the way the movie presents his characters makes him an interesting one. Once you&#039;ve learned of his anguish, you can&#039;t help but feel sorry for him. But don&#039;t expect too much from Robin, since her character was still a mystery when this was released (during Water 7 arc).<br />
<br />
And all the uncomfortable atmosphere that surrounds the movie are accompanied by timely-placed soundtracks. Those familiar with the anime series will recognize few soundtracks from it. Despite that, it is not short of movie-originals. It is also worth discussing is how the movie can have minutes of full silence. The mute scenes grab your attention easily and can make you really nervous about how will the next event unfold.<br />
<br />
Final thoughts and recommendation:<br />
This movie is clearly far from being a masterpiece. But to blast it just because it&#039;s not the usual One Piece is unfair. Movie 6 clearly accomplished something and that is worth crediting. So, do I recommend this to everyone? For the newcomers, whether you plan to catch up or not, wait until you&#039;ve finished Skypiea arc. For the longtime fans who missed this, just readjust your One Piece knowledge back to how things were during Water 7 arc. Not really leaning to it as a stand-alone, but those not following One Piece but has little knowledge about it are free to watch.<br />
<br />
As always, thank you for reading this review until the end.<br />

    I just finished watching this movie for the first time a few minutes ago... And I believed it was important to write this review with the feelings it just left me... I loved it. For the sake of the future viewers I won&#039;t write any spoilers other than this: &quot;One piece meets the first fullmetal alchemist series&quot;. It has it all: laughs,tears,adventure,animation (and the 3d was quite well used IMO), nice sound and so much more. I was really surprised because it was different from any one piece related material I&#039;ve ever seen before. And in its own way gave a different look and tone

          <span style="display: none;" id="review194277">
        to the series that I really appreciated.

    Baron Omatsuri and the Secret Island is the sixth movie based off the One Piece Franchise and is by far the darkest ive ever seen one piece get. If your a one piece fan you should really give this movie a watch.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story begins enough.<br />
The Straw Hats are sailing around the ocean when they come across a flier for a resort island. once they see this they automatically decide to go for some much needed rest and relaxation.<br />
it starts out with what seems to be a lighthearted story but as the movie goes on the tone almost completely changes.<br />
If your looking for epic boss fights

          <span style="display: none;" id="review134849">
        then this movie may not be for you. <br />
The movie is more about the bond luffy and his nakama all share. <br />
And thats why i love this movie. Its so different from the series itself.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
The animation style is also diffrent as well but i feel it still fits one piece pretty well. it reminded me of the old animation style that alot of anime used in the 90s. alot of is also computer generated as well. It has a style all its own.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The voice acting is great as usual.<br />
The score on the other hand wasn&#039;t all to great. i only found 1 or 2 songs memorable at best. The music wasnt TERRIBLE or anything but not as good as what we usually get from one piece<br />
<br />
Chracters:<br />
This is where the movie shines. <br />
This movie shows a different side to the characters while not letting them go out of character. They all still act normal,  but the movie manages to show sides we may or may have not seen. Like i said, it also shows how strong the bond between luffy and his crew. I also found the movie only characters endearing as well. kinda wish the movie was canon so they could appear in the series sometime.<br />
<br />
All in all its a good movie and all One Piece fans should check it out. It may be diffrent but that certainly isnt a bad thing.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading! This is my first review so if you have advice anything like that contact me :)<br />
<br />

    I never thought that One Piece could be so dark and beautiful. Overall rating [9.2/10]<br />
<br />
<br />
Story [9/10] - The story continues with Luffy and the crew visiting the Omatsuri Island where despite its happy and joyful name hides a very dark secret. Quite different from the usual One Piece story with hype and everything. This movie shows the bond of the crew in a special and different way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art [9/10] - Considering the year this was made, it&#039;s really impressive. The movements are very smooth you would think it was made around 2010 at least. Beautifully made.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound [8/10] - No OST left an impression on me but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review248202">
        the way they cut off the sound at the most crucial parts made it more intense and dark.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters [10/10] - I may be quite biased on this one but I would still say it regardless. Strawhat crew for me is the most beautiful bond ever. Nakama isn&#039;t just a word. It goes deeper than that. Something a thousand words couldn&#039;t explain. Or at least that&#039;s how it looks to me after watching this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment [10/10]

    Firstly I would like to say I’m glad I waited for the Kaizoku-Fansubs version of this movie (K-F are the best hands down everyone knows that, even tho they are behind a little).<br />
<br />
This was hands down IMO the best One Piece Movie to date; it was like a long version of a very good episode with a VERY DARK &amp; DISGUSTING turn of events. I’ll try to keep this spoiler-free.<br />
<br />
Animation<br />
<br />
Animation was great, they seemed to have spent more money on it this time so the scenery was wonderfully designed and the action scenes where just straight forward and excellent ESPICALLY the ending parts.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
Story was great

          <span style="display: none;" id="review41125">
        this time because it was more like an episode where they go somewhere and just have a little fun, this is what makes one piece - the series great, then later when you do get to see the DARK &amp; TWISTED storyline trust me you will find yourself shocked and excited....compared to the last movie this was a good change of pace.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
<br />
Character is what makes one piece what it is and as usual the comedy and action makes the characters great. The other (movie) characters are also quite interesting but nothing out of the ordinary…..this is what makes the actual storyline a bit of a surprise.<br />
<br />
Value<br />
<br />
Value would be good if I could get a One Piece Movie collection boxset, but to purchase on its own is not great value for money even though I love this movie<br />

    I love one piece as one of the funny and enjoyable movie. I just finished watching Strong world this morning. I laughed a lot, loved the characters, loved the scenes, music etc. <br />
<br />
And then i watched this before going sleep:<br />
<br />
The drawing style is really different. The line art is a bit messy sometimes, theres no shadow or details in the the characters. However the artist putted a LOT of focus on the background, which was awesome. But as the other 4 rate review said, it made me enjoy the background in the city more than the story/characters itself.<br />
<br />
I dont know about you but the characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review120929">
        is a really is really important in one piece i think. They all have unique personalities and they are always together. In this movie it really showed a different side of them that you never ever see in other episodes. I&#039;m not sure if it was a good thing or bad thing.. For me it ruined it a bit.<br />
<br />
As for sound:<br />
We know One piece have awesome BGMs. In this movie i really missed more background music and sound... It was way too quiet...<br />
<br />
Things happen FAST in this movie. Things jump around and there is a lot of screens that u wont see. Is almost like they fast forwarded the movie. YET they choose to make every screen way too long. There was numerous of times in the movie where i thought it was frozen.<br />
<br />
The GOOD thing is. The story was pretty nice and dramatic. <br />
<br />
But it would have suited better on another anime and not one piece...<br />
<br />
Overall i didnt enjoy it with a smile.. Rather i feel kinda gloomy and bad now. If ur in mood to watch a dark movie go ahead.<br />
<br />
Sorry if i offended anyone..

    I&#039;m writing this review from the perspective of someone who’s always been interested in - and wanted to get round to - watching One Piece, but has yet to do so. I came into this movie not knowing any of the characters, story, or even really what genre the original show was in. “Just pirates” is all I really thought of it, but watched the movie anyway because it’s a work by my favourite director: Hosoda Mamoru. I think the fact I liked it enough to breech my silence and write my first ever review on MAL after over a decade of using the site

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315533">
        is an important aspect of what made this movie so good, however. So, without further ado - here’s a brief, spoiler-free review.<br />
<br />
The plot is no different from what you’d find in an episodic isekai or monster-of-the-week shounen: it’s not what you watch the movie for, but the added length over a 22 minute version of the same plot never feels dragged out because Omatsuri is so well embellished with fun and action sequences leading up to the halfway point. When you reach just over halfway, there’s a complete shift in tone that doesn’t feel at all sudden or jolting given the general “creepiness” of the first half acting as foreshadowing. In general, the plot pays off, the characters pay off, and everything’s simple enough to be wrapped up at the end with a nice wholesome bow. <br />
<br />
As for the art, I have to try hard not to be biased. I’m a huge fan of this art style for nostalgic reasons, mostly, and although I spotted a few animation mishaps throughout (none were distracting or detracted from the overall quality), it continued to make me smile simply due to how free and unpolished (in the best way) it feels to me, personally. The art style makes this feel like a ‘summer’ movie; a fun ride, and it just screams “K.I.S.S.” (keep it simple, stupid.). Maybe not everyone’s cup of tea, though - which is actually why my rating is a 9, and not a 10, like what I’ve given it on my own list. <br />
<br />
I loved the voice acting in Omatsuri, and I’m adding the ending song to my spotify after I type this. All the performances were stellar throughout - my only notable complaint being a scene where two characters talk at each other across a distance, and in an attempt to make the other sound far away, their voice had been near silenced, and if I weren’t watching with subtitles I wouldn’t have been able to hear it at all. Other than that, I’m not a big sound guy, none of the background sounds or music stood out to me as particular bad or good - same with special effects or general foley. <br />
<br />
Like I mentioned before, I came into this movie not knowing anything about the characters from the original show, so with completely new eyes, I can say that Omatsuri did a really good job at endearing the cast to me. Each has their own personality and screen-time, and even with no previous experience I can safely say I enjoyed them all throughout - bad guy, good guy, bystander. No disappointment.<br />
<br />
Overall, I love this movie, and can’t wait to watch it again with friends. I think the first half is some of the best choreographed and animated sequences I’ve seen in a while, and getting to know as much as I did about the characters and writing style in such a short amount of time is the mark of a movie created with true care. Anyone who’s a fan of slightly darker / ‘creepier’ horror rather than typical jumpscares will enjoy this, too, as the contrast from the first to second half made me reflect mid-watch on just how much ground this film covered, more than once. I’d recommend this to anyone - OP fan or not, Hosoda fan or not, anime fan or not - and can only sing its praises. I think any production capable of making a completely alien series palatable to the watcher with no prior affiliation is exceptional, and only wish there were more.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading!<br />

    When we think of &quot;One Piece&quot;, we immediately assume this premise &quot;&#039;The Crew is sailing somewhere, cross roads and trade blows with the antagonist in the middle of their nefarious plans, the Crew decides to derail said plans by fighting him and his henchman with Luffy punching out the final villain&#039;. <br />
<br />
Story: In contrast to other films before or since then, it is willing to deconstruct things like Nakama and show how it can be easily broken apart. <br />
<br />
Art: The looks of the characters may look below for the series, but it proves to be necessary in evoking how there is a dark and ugly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review234267">
        secret hidden on this island. <br />
<br />
Sound: There was more effort in utilizing the soundtrack to evoke the mood of the scenes like humor, frustration, mystery and especially horror.<br />
<br />
Characters: The highlight of this film. Where interations that turn hilarious in the beggining, turn out to be twisted manipulations done by the villain Baron Omatsuri. Who rivals Doflamingo in terms of evil and terror, while still retaining sympathetic elements that are cleverly revealed at the end of of the story. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: The first act may be hard to digest for it&#039;s unusual art direction, but it pays off in the second and third acts of the film.<br />
<br />
Overall: A forgotten jewel within the list of One Piece films, that deserves a viewing for the sake of quality at the time.<br />
<br />

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Turns out the one thing I really wanted from a One Piece film was some goddamn personality. As good as Dead End Adventure was, you could easily argue it was trying too hard to be like the series to really stand on its own. Baron Omatsuri and the Secret Island is one of a kind and does its own thing while staying just familiar enough to keep with the spirit of One Piece. Once you get used how different it looks from anything One Piece-related that had been made at that point, this is clearly the best One Piece film that had

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287126">
        been made at this.<br />
<br />
At first I was a bit put off by the very different animation style of this film. Mamoru Hosoda seems to have a very particular style to his work. He seems to be a fairly well-known director, but I haven&#039;t actually seen any other of his films, with the exception of the Digimon Adventure movie, (the short film, not the Fox Kids hack job). I thought the animation for that film worked great, but wasn&#039;t entirely sure this style worked as well for the One Piece characters. I was also coming right from the series, and at this point the series had gone over to HD and widescreen and looked more beautiful and detailed than ever. Compared to that Hosoda&#039;s style looked more simple and messy. But after a while the style started grow on me more, and it&#039;s hard for me to deny that the animation is organic and a lot of fun to look at, or that this style fits the whacky world of One Piece pretty well. The ring toss boat race, the final battle and the best fishing scene of all time in particular look great and are both dynamic and creative. As different as the character designs look, they are also very expressive and give the characters a lot of personality with the way they look and move. I also can&#039;t think of many directors who would be a able to make a simple tube shape genuinely terrifying. As the film goes from funny and care-free to more serious and dark, the animation is able to pull of the transition perfectly well with some very well chosen angles and color pallets.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, that&#039;s also part of what I like about the story. I&#039;m always impressed by stories that can start off so simple, and then gradually reveal that there&#039;s a lot more going on underneath the surface. The Straw Hat Pirates are invited to a resort by the baron Omatsuri where they are challenged to take on the so-called ordeals of Hell, which Luffy of course accepts due to his combination of bravery and stupidity. At first it seems like the movie will just be about the crew taking on different challenges, akin to the Long Ring Long Land arc from the series, but it soon turns out there&#039;s more going on with the people on the island and that the baron has some rather worrying motives. The story behind the baron isn&#039;t all that detailed, but actually is somewhat tragic, and the film goes pretty dark in the second half.<br />
<br />
The message is a bit different from what you usually get in One Piece. Usually the series is about strong bonds of friendship overcoming any hardships, but this film is more about what happens when these bonds are broken. The baron refused to accept the death of his friends, and decided to revive them by destroying other people&#039;s friendships, and even succeeds in separating the Straw Hats. We of course know that they are not going to actually die since the rest of the series still needs to happen, and a non-canon movie isn&#039;t going to start killing off major characters. But nonetheless, the conflict is resolved because Luffy is able to find other friends to put his trust in, and the other Straw Hats aren&#039;t saved until the climax ends. I find it very impressive that the film can tell you it&#039;s important to move on and not seem hypocritical when Luffy&#039;s friends still come back in the end, and I think that&#039;s mostly because of how strong Luffy&#039;s emotional development is here. I genuinely like that he for once genuinely takes responsibility in a way other than being strong.<br />
<br />
I think I also like this antagonist the most out of any of the antagonists from the films I&#039;ve seen so far. It&#039;s true that a lot of One Piece&#039;s villains so far haven&#039;t been all that deep, but I think there&#039;s one thing that still makes a lot of them good antagonists, and that&#039;s motivation. One Piece has always been very strong with motivation as every main character has a very strong dream they want to achieve, (Luffy wants to be the pirate king, Zoro wants to be the world&#039;s strongest swords,an, etc.) and that makes them much more memorable. Granted, not all the antagonists have had the same luxury, but I think most of the more memorable ones have. Arlong wanted to establish and maintain his inherent superiority as a fish man, Enel wanted to be a god, Kuro wanted riches without having to run from the marines. And when it comes to the movies, I think the antagonist of Chopper&#039;s Kingdom on the Island of Strange Animals is the only one before this film to have a good motivation as he wanted to find the sacred animal&#039;s horn to harness their power. It wasn&#039;t a very deep motivation, but it was one that fit into his personality and made me remember him more. The best antagonist aside from him would be the one from Dead Island Adventure as he had a decent backstory and was somewhat entertaining, but the problem with him was that he lacked motivation. All he really wanted was excitement. It&#039;s not that you can&#039;t make that a good motivation, but if you, for instance, think of Saitama from One Punch Man, then his lack of excitement had genuinely affected his life and made a him a much more apathetic person, so there was reason for him to seek excitement that made it a very strong motivation.<br />
<br />
So even though baron Omatsuri isn&#039;t necessarily that deep, I think he&#039;s the most memorable antagonist from the films so far because he has the strongest motivation. He really wants to maintain the bond he has with his friends even after they died, and it&#039;s also because of how much a similar bond means to Luffy and how much it drives that we understand that just how strong of a motivation this is for him. Of course, what makes him an antagonist is that he kills people to keep his friends alive at that he stubbornly wants to destroy other friendships because he couldn&#039;t naturally maintain his own bonds of friendship. Luffy is the hero for a similar reason, as he&#039;s the one able to move on and get new friends to help him even when his friends aren&#039;t able to be part of the action anymore.<br />
<br />
The only complaint about this film I can think of, is that the ending is a bit too abrupt. Especially considering how much the crew was fighting with each during this film, it would have been nice have a little bit of extra time to see them get along again. But with that being said, I also think the characters were very well written overall, and most of them got something to do, even if most of the Straw Hats were out of comission after a while.<br />
<br />
I really thought this was a great film with an engaging and surprising story and some really good animation.

    These are my thoughts on:<br />
One Piece Movie 6: Omatsuri Danshaku to Himitsu no Shima<br />
<br />
The story is kind of like a short roller-coaster. In a sense where, you start off kinda slow and you&#039;re waiting for the thrill and then it all comes down on you in one fell swoop. The first half of this film is very laid back, familiar One Piece environment for sure, and then the second half becomes incredibly engaging with its darker setting and epic conclusion. I personally believe that the story of this movie was a lot better then previous One Piece standalone&#039;s due to its great writing, creativity and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review226355">
        the impact it has on the viewer.<br />
<br />
The animation and art style of this film are completely out of the norm for One Piece. This movie had me constantly saying &quot;wow&quot; because of everything that made it unique from other installments. Hiroyuki Imaishi and You Yoshinari (Kill La Kill, Gurren Laggan, etc.) are responsible for the animation and they do an excellent job, bringing these characters we know and love into a different light is ambitious. I even thought to myself, &quot;I wonder what other art style&#039;s One Piece would work with?&quot;. Overall I enjoyed the art style and the animation even more so. <br />
<br />
The sound for this film is what you would expect. You have typical One Piece<br />
background tracks which seem to suit any situation and never grow old. The usage of tracks in both lighthearted and dark parts of the film is very well done and the voice acting is top notch. The voice actors of OP always give it there all!<br />
<br />
In the beginning, all of the Straw Hats are doing what they usually do until around halfway through the film where they start dropping off one by one and then the last 30 minutes makes this somewhat questionable story element make sense. The characters of this film are themselves. You laugh, you wonder, you feel happy, you feel sad and you feel triumphant in the end.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I find this to be one of the most enjoyable films in the series. Previous movies are typical treasure hunt or beat em&#039; up films with very underwhelming plots and stories while this movie I heavily enjoyed and respect for being out of &quot;character&quot; and unique. <br />
<br />
This is a must watch for any One Piece fan!

    This is my first Review so please dont judge me!!<br />
One piece Movie 6:Omatsuri Danshaku to Himitsu Shima(Baron Omatsuri and the Secret Island) as you can see its the sixth movie of One Piece and i have to say that this movie is the most different and creepy(for me) of  all the other movies of One Piece and the mostly part of the movie that is different and i have to say strange also is the animation.The animation may be good but it was so weird that i thought that maybe another studio instead of Toei Animation did the movie but if you forget the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246205">
        animation it has the same plot as all the other One Piece movies.

    This movie was very interesting. It did have the traits of One Piece, but the direction und scenery was very different, which was an excellent choice because it worked in this movie&#039;s favour.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned the art is really different from the &quot;usual&quot; One Piece and it was at times imo really creepy at the other half of the movie.<br />
<br />
What can I say, this is a must watch for any OP Fan and even for any that haven&#039;t watched/read OP yet. It shows One Piece at a different approach.<br />
<br />
Had a fun evening with this film and because I personally haven&#039;t disliked anything about this movie

    Damn that final battle was Berserk tier horrifying <br />
The art is great, most shots could make great wallpapers, the vilain goes from ok to absolutely terrifying and the side character are endearing<br />
I like to keep my reviews short so the rest of the review is only so I pass the dumb review length rule<br />
<br />
I cannot think or comprehend of anything more cucked than having a daughter. Honestly, think about it rationally. You are feeding, clothing, raising and rearing a girl for at least 18 years solely so she can go and get ravaged by another man. All the hard work you put into your beautiful

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320664">
        little girl - reading her stories at bedtime, making her go to sports practice, making sure she had a healthy diet, educating her, playing with her. All of it has one simple result: her body is more enjoyable for the men that will eventually fuck her in every hole.<br />
Raised the perfect girl? Great. Who benefits? If you&#039;re lucky, a random man who had nothing to do with the way she grew up, who marries her. He gets to fuck her tight pussy every night. He gets the benefits of her kind and sweet personality that came from the way you raised her.<br />
As a man who has a daughter, you are LITERALLY dedicating at least 20 years of your life simply to raise a girl for another man to enjoy. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL cuck. Think about it logically
