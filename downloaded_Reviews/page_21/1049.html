    Binbougami ga! is an excellent example of a simply outrageous anime. I&#039;d chalk up Beelzebub or Kore wa Zombie Desu-ka as similar animes.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was on the fence with the anime originally because of the story synopsis. On top of the weird girl with the bandana, I was turned off until the 5th episode came out. Then I started to watch the series.<br />
<br />
Binbougami ga! is hilarious and completely slapstick. It features obvious references to other anime/manga or Japanese tropes while boasting a simple but fairly heartwarming arc as Sakura Ichiko proves she is a dynamic character.<br />
<br />
Comedy wise, the visuals and voice acting really bring it all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review69531">
        together beautifully.<br />
<br />
Character wise, everything is pretty fun. The main characters bring a lot of a fun to the table especially. In fact, most of the characters are surprisingly unpredictable at times, yielding some funny results.<br />
<br />
The music matches sequences well and the track is fairly reminiscent of Final Fantasy XIII&#039;s battle theme and victory fanfare which is -- odd.<br />
<br />
The only thing that&#039;s detracted from this anime for me is the bad video players I use and at the start, I had some serious problems with Misfortune God&#039;s bandana and cast -- but I eventually warmed up to it and I learned to tolerate watching the first 10 minutes of an episode more than once.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ultimately, if you&#039;ve already picked up the series -- you&#039;ve probably already decided your views on the anime with 6 episodes under your belt. However, if you were on the fence about it -- please give 1-2 episodes a chance!<br />
<br />
The driving plot point of the anime is fresh in the midst of a fairly awkward summer season and allows for fun slapstick comedy on top of some fairly bittersweet moments.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS; The intro song seems familiar, but I can&#039;t really put my finger on it. It&#039;s an okay song, although the end theme isn&#039;t much fun -- for me at least.<br />
<br />
<br />
Have a good day and thanks for reading!<br />

    What is something you would spend your 23 minutes on per episode, that&#039;ll make you very tired of laughing? The answer is &quot;Binbougami ga!&quot; <br />
<br />
Here&#039;s a review based on my opinions after completing the anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
【Story】Rating: 8<br />
<br />
Binbougami ga! is not only known for its humour, it also teaches the viewers a lesson in life about sharing, respecting and caring for others rather than being selfish; only thinking about ourselves. It also displays how anything is possible if we look beyond what&#039;s there. For example, Ichiko, the well known beauty queen of the class who&#039;s perfect at everything, totally self-centred, pretty much you can describe her as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review108779">
        a &quot;snob&quot;. Well let me say, even she can change into a more caring person with the help of Momiji, the goddess of misfortune and others. <br />
<br />
<br />
【Art】Rating: 8<br />
<br />
The art in Binbougami ga! is nice, although it&#039;s not the best I ever seen, however it can range from simple artwork to really nice ones. However I would want Momiji and Ranmaru to actually wear the school&#039;s uniform throughout the anime when they&#039;re at school. I mean wouldn&#039;t the school not allow students breaking the dress code rule? Having Ranmaru wear a blue outfit and sandals can quite make her stand out especially when she has bright pink hair and the binds wrapped around her chest. Although Momiji for the most of the time is wearing a uniform, but it&#039;s nothing close to the school&#039;s. Despite that, judging from the character designs, it&#039;s still nice and you can see everyone&#039;s characteristics. <br />
<br />
<br />
【Sound】Rating: 9<br />
<br />
The music and sound effects are pretty good but I would say sometimes, the voice acting may over-exaggerate a bit yet it still brings out the goods of this anime. I was really surprised when I heard Hanazawa Kana (voice of Ichiko) change her voice tone in this. Let&#039;s just say all of the Seiyū are amazing with the change of tone, expression, range and emotions of the voice. Great work guys!!<br />
<br />
<br />
【Character】Rating: 8<br />
<br />
The characters are just spectacular as viewers can see both the main character&#039;s two sided personality. For Ichiko, she may be called the beauty queen among the male classmates, but when you see the other side of her she can be a snob. On the other hand, Momiji can be really lazy but she gives out good advices to the viewers and of course, to our Ichiko. When you put these two together, they make the perfect pair and can create many memorable humorous acts. Although as I mentioned before that sometimes they tend to over-exaggerate, anyhow it brings out the joy of laughter to everyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
【Enjoyment】Rating: 9<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed watching Binbougami ga!. I laughed throughout every episode and I wondered to myself &quot;how did they come up with that idea? that&#039;s awesome!&quot;. I just can&#039;t get enough of this with only 13 episodes, I hope for a second season to be on its way soon. <br />
<br />
<br />
【Overall】Rating: 8<br />
<br />
To be honest, at first I was reluctant to watch this however after completing the whole thing, I must say that Binbougami ga! has become one of my personal favourite anime. It is an excellent anime to watch when you want to relax especially having great big laughs in almost every episode. <br />
<br />
So if you&#039;re looking for a worth to watch anime, Binbougami ga! is the right choice for you. It is just marvelous. <br />

    Binbougami Ga is a comedic shounen series written by Sukeno Yoshiaki. The manga ran from 2008 to 2013. At the tail end of the manga&#039;s run Sunrise, the studio behind Gundam, Cowboy Bebop, Code Geass &amp; Love Live to name a few, worked on a thirteen episode anime adaptation. How well does the anime version hold up? Let&#039;s check it out.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Sakura Ichiko is blessed with great fortune, far more than a regular human possesses. In fact, she unconsciously steals fortune from the people around her, ensuring her own good luck. In order to maintain the balance betwixt fortune &amp; misfortune, the Gods of misfortune send

          <span style="display: none;" id="review229036">
        Binboda Momiji to Earth. Her mission, drain Ichiko&#039;s fortune and prevent her stealing anyone else&#039;s. This quickly results in various schemes and shenanigans as Ichiko tries to protect her own interests and the battle between the lucky girl and the Goddess of misfortune is joined.<br />
<br />
The biggest issue with the series is that a good portion of the humour isn&#039;t just trite and predictable, but it&#039;s flimsy at the best of times. We get the stereotypical perverted monk/master/priest that&#039;s oh so generic and played out. We also get the masochistic gag character who just wants to be hit by pretty girls. The only twist to him is that he&#039;s a dog God in this. We also get the fan-service jokes, which basically operate under the assumption that shameless fan-service isn&#039;t shameless fan-service if it acknowledges that it&#039;s shameless fan-service. We also get references used as jokes. This series courageously acknowledges that such series as Dragonball, Doraemon &amp; Lupin exist. Because those are just such obscure series that the audience might have forgotten them. All without making any kind of humorous statements about them that might elevate those references to parody.<br />
<br />
That being said, the series does have its funny moments. A lot of the competitive stuff with Ichiko &amp; Momiji works pretty nicely, when they leave out the monk and the dog God or hurriedly toss them to the refuse bin where they belong. The series is at its best when it blurs the boundaries of Ichiko &amp; Momiji&#039;s relationship. Those moments where they seem more friendly and less like actual enemies. There are also some good comedic moments with Ranmaru. The more emotional scenes involving the three of them do work quite nicely at times. Aside from that, though, the more serious scenes tend to be just bland.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
The characters vary quite a bit. There are some like Ichiko, Momiji &amp; Ranmaru who are decent enough for the sake of a comedy. Then there are characters like Bobby, Momoo &amp; the trio of girls who really hate Sakura who exist solely for one repeated, unfunny joke or to add cheap, completely unnecessary drama. Which is also the primary reason that the scenes with the three main ladies are the best in the series.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The biggest problem with the art is that it&#039;s overly fond of fan-service. Or it would be, except that it magically doesn&#039;t count because the series acknowledges it. Does that line of non-reasoning actually work on anyone? On the positive side, there are some good visual gags here and there and some nice visuals for some of the altercations between Ichiko &amp; Momiji. The negative and those few positives aside, the artwork is passable. Not good, but not bad either.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The acting isn&#039;t badly done. The biggest problem with it is that there&#039;s a lot of exaggerated yelling. They got some skilled actresses for the leads: Uchiyama Yumi, Hanazawa Kana &amp; Tomatsu Haruka have all given some strong performances before, but this isn&#039;t one of the better ones for any of them. Although, in all fairness, it isn&#039;t a bad one either. Their performances here are just kind of okay overall. There are times when they really work and there are times where they don&#039;t. The worst performances come from Shimono Hiro &amp; Kawahara Yoshihisa. Not because they&#039;re bad actors but because their characters are incessantly obnoxious. The music is another aspect that greatly varies. Some of it is quite nice, I actually really liked the opening theme. Other parts of it are kind of annoying and not well done.<br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
There are some points where Momiji and Ichiko not only seem friendly, but seem to be attracted to one another. Particularly towards the end of the series. Ranmaru also gets some female admirers, but they treat her like she&#039;s a boy so it barely counts.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
Binbougami Ga is one of those series that&#039;s highly mixed. Every positive aspect of it is balanced out by something negative. It&#039;s not a bad series, nor is it a good one. All in all, it&#039;s pretty mediocre. My final rating is going to be a 5/10. Next week I&#039;ll be looking at Kuuchuu Buranko. Until then, have a fabulous time.

    Hmmm…….<br />
<br />
You know, seeing the previews of this show a few months ago, I wasn’t the biggest fan of it.<br />
<br />
Then again, as I said in the last review, comedy is a subjective art form and this especially goes into anime. For me, it’s like comedic shows like Sgt. Frog, Panty and Stocking w/ Garterbelt, Squid Girl, &amp; Kill La Kill does better with me than the likes of Baka to Test, Love Hina, B Gata H Kei and Nisekoi. You can say some of them are the same but no…..they’re not.<br />
<br />
I can see myself liking it but then again, it does have the annoying eechi show

          <span style="display: none;" id="review146305">
        feel to it and I have been getting annoyed with those type of shows and the fact most of them may not be my thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Pretty, busty rich girl Sakura Ichiko has been blessed with an inordinate amount of good fortune, so much so that she’s actually sucking the fortune from those around her. To correct that massive imbalance, Momiji, a God of Misfortune, has come to Earth to “treat” Sakura—only Sakura isn’t so willing to cooperate. As part of an ongoing effort to remedy the problem, Momiji starts living with Sakura.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So……..that comedy thing of mine? Yeah, I saw myself laughing at a few moments in the show that are genuine but most of the time when they were referencing other anime (DBZ, One Piece, Lupin, etc.) or go overblown with the eechi/boob jokes, that is when I groan at that (I would say more but SPOILERS). I mean, it just felt very lazy writing like these are last minute jokes someone just came up with and decided to stick in there. There is also the heart of the show being that good luck and happiness comes from within and not from the material things although it does feel weak as it goes along and while it’s decent, some of the aforementioned comedy interrupt those moments and makes it seem very out of place and awkward. I can like kookiness in an anime and I think the show tries to have it both ways but sadly some of the time, I didn’t feel as invested in the story as much…….nor the characters as much either.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ichiko Sakura is the most typical Mary Sue character in the show. She’s adored by all of the guys in schools but loathed by all of the girls but leads a very lonely life even though she has about every material thing in her grasp…..oh, did I mention she got boobs? Hell, her nickname on the show is Tit-chiko and thankfully that didn’t get used as much…..at least from what I heard. I can’t say she progressed but it didn’t felt like de-characterization and I did like the banter between her and Momiji and them getting at each other’s throats. In short for the other characters, Bobby the perverted monk and Momo’o the S&amp;M dog god, whose both character traits gets worn out very early in the show. Keita is pretty much the straight man in the series and the rest of the family are decent as well, just not as interesting and I did like Ranmaru in the show as well as she’s one of the few characters that doesn’t annoy me as much. Also, should I give a fuck about Nadeshiko?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No? Yes? I heard in the manga, she’s more vital in there but this isn’t about the manga, it’s the anime version I’m reviewing and I say…….yeah, I don’t give a fuck about her at all.<br />
<br />
The animation and artwork is okay, it is more of the typical art style that most anime people are used to. Then again, this is much up to Sunrise’s alley as them doing gag comedy isn’t new to them. After all, like I said, Sgt. Frog is one of my favorite anime comedies and they are responsible for that as well and they do succeed with what they’re doing, although I still do get mostly annoyed with it, too.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Musically, my thoughts on that is meh as well. The opening theme for the show is alright, I like the first 8-bit parts of it and other than that, it’s merely okay. Ending theme is also fine as is the rest of the score.<br />
<br />
The FUNimation dub does help me get through the series as it goes along. I did like the performances of Brina Palencia &amp; Colleen Clinkenbeard as Ichiko &amp; Momiji, respectively as they do deliver the best performances of the dub. Patrick Seitz &amp; Todd Haberkorn are pretty type-casted in the show (Seitz being the black guy although he’s damn good at it and Haberkorn playing the one guy with the nasally whiny voice), that’s not to say that were bad in it, that’s the opposite of that as they played their roles very well. Also, I did like Martha Harms as Ranmaru, a VA that I haven’t recognized in FUNi dubs in the past that could become more noticeable in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
FINAL VERDICT: The show does have its charms and I have thought of some moments in there to be funny and have some heart but it does tend to lose that quickly when some of the humor gets tired. It’s stupid and silly in both the right ways…..and the wrong ways, too. I will say that it is worth a watch but this is more of a stream it rather than buy right away. Just dip your toe in the world of Good Luck Girl first before owning any DVD and/or Blu-ray.

    Ichiko is a rich, beautiful mary-sue of a teenage girl, who is adored by all of the boys of her class–but hated by the females. In short, she’s pretty much the stereotypical bitch, but underneath her apparent superiority-complex, she’s really a lonely child longing for friendship. She also has an excessive amount of “Fortune,” which causes her suck other Fortune energy from those around her. This causes Momiji, a god of misfortune, to try and steal Ichiko’s fortune, and a beautiful love-hate relationship is formed!<br />
<br />
Binbougami ga! is a very silly series. In fact, it’s a really stupid series–sometimes in the positive ha-ha kind of stupid,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review85391">
        and others times in bad sense of the word. In general it’s one of those shows that allows to simply relax and enjoy it for what it is and not vehemently critique it, although there are scenes that stand out as mediocre or subpar.<br />
<br />
The dramatic aspects are by the far the shows weak-point, as it’s fairly mediocre all the way through. It’s a predictable action-comedy from the get-go, and pretty forgettable. Initially the execution alone is done well enough to make it enjoyable, but it’s doesn’t take long for the formulaic nature of the plot to override that. More often than not the the comedy makes up for all this, so it’s an enjoyable series for the most part<br />
<br />
Much of the comedy relies on the specific quirks of each character. This allows for plenty of quality comedy for quite a while, but towards the end of the series they all start to lose their charm, and everything starts to seem tedious. Ichiko and Momiji are relatively more complex, but every other character literally has their quirk define them; every time Ranmaru shows up, the scene pokes fun at her tomboy demeanor, as with Bobby’s pervertism, or Momoo’s masochism.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, the actual ending of the series (episode 11-13) breaks out of the formula, and gives us a satisfying conclusion.

    Okay~ since the other reviewers have already made almost all points of view regarding this anime (including summary and what they think about the art and everything) so, here&#039;s a simple review of mine.<br />
<br />
I always regarded Ecchi, Comedy, Parody anime as something to pass the time. For the reasons: 1.) It is hilarious (who doesn&#039;t want a good laugh?) 2.) The story is light, not too complicated (like I said, just something to pass the time) 3.) Full of ecchi moments (I know I sound like a perverted old woman) 4.) Also, full of cute moments~<br />
<br />
But, this anime, isn&#039;t JUST an ecchi, parody or a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review79198">
        something-really-hilarious-and-not-too-serious anime~ It is more than that. Comedy-wise, it didn&#039;t disappoint me. I find myself laughing hard at all the funny scenes which makes me feel better everyday~ But, it didn&#039;t fail to give every episode a meaning, too.<br />
<br />
This anime is light and yet it has substance (if you know what I mean). A very good watch, indeed! ;) Highly recommended, so I gave it a perfect score. :)<br />

    Binbou Gami Ga is one of my top 3 favorites for this summers anime line up. I have found it hilarious from episode one and i want more and more of this show this is what gets me to my Fridays.<br />
<br />
The Story is highly unique with 2 very opposing character types. At first it would seem like you would sympathize with Ichiko but you find out shes one of the worst most undeserving people ever. Though as the show steadily progresses that sympathy builds a little cause you realize shes damaged inside from various missing aspects of the human experience. Then you bring in Momiji

          <span style="display: none;" id="review68481">
        a god of misforunte who&#039;s sole duty on earth is to make Ichikos life worse and spread her good fortune to others to balance the world. So with a snotty brat like Ichiko to take down Momiji has her work cut out for her. <br />
<br />
Steadily the show is building a broader cast with all sorts of interesting character types. From a turtle man too a bizarre teddy bear you got a really interesting cast to say the least. I have not seen many examples of these types of characters, i have seen elements of them but the combinations of all these little pieces creates a very unique cast.  I look forward to seeing who is next in the line up for this series as the shows opening credits promise at least one or two more intriguing characters.<br />
<br />
Right now Momiji is my favorite character in this series, her design is unlike anything i have ever seen before in anime or television. A cross between a homeless person and a country girl. The one shoe&#039;d,overall clad, one arm bandaged god of misfortune is something my imagination is quite amazed with. Her color pallet is paler than the rest of the cast really feeding into her characters misfortune like shes been deprived of sunlight and joy. Tho being the god of misfortune she is by far the funnest and most excitable character in the show. When going in to this i had expected her to be either very evil or very depressed. I was glad she was more or less evil and good and not depressed at all really. The biggest source of parody comedy in the series comes from her and her cosplay styled side skits.<br />
<br />
The art for this show is great all the characters are pretty well designed and unique. The backgrounds aren&#039;t lacking and the overall feel of the shows visual experience is great. Nothing significant stands out in this show except for each of the bizarre cast members.  The audio is very organic to the show, it feels really well used and appropriately used at all time. The voice cast is also a fantastic choice for each and every character thus far. I cant say i feel anyone is out of place when it comes to voice to face. The Opening and Ending Themes are actually two of my favorite theme songs to listen too in the last year or two, both delightfully charming in there own way while various characters and cosplays roll across the screen providing some sort of fan service for those interested in watching.<br />
<br />
Tho the show uses some Ecchi elements its not as strong as other shows, there isn&#039;t any groping or cliche stuff like that. Its more just jokes about flat chests and S&amp;M. Some of the jokes are standard but others are kept above par and original. The show escalates from a chase to a battle very quickly and makes the game of cat and mouse more enjoyable to watch as the the tides turn and bend in anyone favor.<br />
<br />
I really enjoy this show and i think that if you watch 1 episode and like it your gonna be pleased you keep watching. Then again this kind of humor is not everyone&#039;s favorite and some people will know right away if they like it or not. I think its worth a fair shot if you enjoy comedy anime.  This is Getting a 10 for me for being outstanding to me, i really have no complaints thus far with the series and if there is i will edit this to reflect that. I am highly optimistic that the most i will be editing is a error in my typing tho.

    Binbougami ga!<br />
This is a quick review. Binbougami ga! is simple but great that&#039;s it, is as simple as that.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
I have seen the concept of a Shinigami or a god of something coming for the MC, because or they want to kill him or want to help the MC, Binbougami is just like that but very well presented, it&#039;s a good story but this is comedy and i tend not to take much serious the story on comedy.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation<br />
The animation was great, the landscape was very good, the characters were very well detailed and were beautiful to see and it was colorful.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The sound of this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195346">
        on every aspect is just amazing, i really loved it there&#039;s not a flaw for me, the VA, the background music, the OP and the ED everything was outstanding.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
The cast of characters were great, they made this really enjoyable and the best of the cast is Momiji she is just amazing and Ichiko was made like a total bitch, and you just want Momiji to take her &#039;&#039;lucky&#039;&#039; excess from her already, but that&#039;s the show it makes sense that&#039;s why it&#039;s like that, if not there is no show.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
The whole enjoyment is the comedy and parodies that are presented in every episode and how the characters were spot on with every parody or joke, there&#039;s a lot of winks at others animes, look closely to see those winks.

    Did I just find myself a rare exquisite gem? Or was I just living under a rock when this series aired back in 2012? I honestly don&#039;t know why or how I didn&#039;t hear of this back then. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been watching a bit more titles this 2014 compared to the past couple of years and I&#039;ve only been inclined to write a review again just THIS once. So I&#039;ll keep it sweet and short!<br />
<br />
If I had just one word to describe the story, it would be &quot;refreshing&quot;. I know that there are tons of titles out there that involve deities but this one just stands

          <span style="display: none;" id="review158255">
        on its own. Its lighthearted and even breaks the 4th wall but you can&#039;t help but really get into it. And I just love the characters! Most of them, if not all of them anyway. How often do you get a protagonist that would qualify as a high school villain/queen in any other show? But she grows on you and watching her develop was such a treat. And then here&#039;s  our deuteragonist whose character is really just outstanding. I mean her job is to restore balance to the world and all but I love how she went from dutifully lazy &gt; menacing &gt; annoying &gt; moe.<br />
And the dynamic between the two was so superbly done, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve watched any other show that comes close. You could kinda sense it in the OP and ED sequence.<br />
<br />
The art was really good as I didn&#039;t notice a drop in quality even when watching on a big screen. <br />
But more importantly, this is probably the biggest contributing factor why this show made me laugh so much as its syncs perfectly with the parodies. They used a bunch of styles on the characters which I really enjoyed. And let me just get this out there: I love BOOBIES! I really do. And this show has given me my fix. But don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m usually put off and could smell cheap fanservice a mile away, but the way they delivered it here was excellent. Not once did I think that it was forced. I just sat here, giggled, and muttered boobies when it happened.<br />
Soundtrack is also excellent and upbeat, just the way I like it. Normally when you marathon a series, you sometimes skip the OP and ED sequence but I don&#039;t think I did it even once here. Let that be a testimony in itself on how good it is.<br />
<br />
All in all, I really really enjoyed watching. Normally I would finish a 12-13 episode series in one sitting but Binbougami forced me to do it in two. Reason being, the thought of finishing it so fast made me sad and I wanted to prolong my time with it.<br />
<br />
I hope what I wrote would convince those who aren&#039;t sold yet on just the synopsis :)<br />
And if you&#039;ll excuse me, Imma go pick up the manga so I can get MOAR!

    Here are my initial impressions of the first episode. <br />
<br />
An interesting premise, where the God of Misfortune is trying to take away Sakura&#039;s ability to take the fortune/ happiness energy of others which has resulted in her abnormally high amount of fortune, to solve the energy imbalance of the world.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a comedy but mixes well with some drama and some touching moments. I liked the comedy and the parody references to other anime &amp; manga.<br />
<br />
Sakura may seem like the typical popular girl who&#039;s clever, has all the boy&#039;s attention and rich, but she has some tsundere qualities. Momiji, the God of Misfortune stood out for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review65495">
        me with her crazy antics.<br />
<br />
Overall, i really enjoyed the first episode. I found it quite funny &amp; i love how the plot is all WTF and crazy. Looks promising and great fun. :)

    Dakara one way, two way, three way, four way <br />
Go way! Go way!<br />
 Saa you! Make my day! <br />
Sonna muzukashii koto ka?<br />
<br />
Saaaa, now &quot;Binbougami ga&quot; has ended, so how do I rate this 13 episode anime?<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s how:<br />
<br />
Story: Good 7.<br />
<br />
Ok, so this anime&#039;s genre which is compose of comedy, parody and supernatural are a good combinations, the story completely revolves around the parody which is good. I really like the way where the Momiji tries but fails to get Ichiko&#039;s good luck energy to put balance in the world, it kind reminds me of a certain situation in the &quot;Road Runner&#039;s show&quot; (Beep, Beep) where Wile

          <span style="display: none;" id="review73505">
        E. Coyote would always try to make the speedy Road Runner (Beep,Beep) his meal. But compare to that old cartoon this one has that thing where Momiji would almost succeed  but failed again to get Ichiko&#039;s good luck energy where it gives that certain unpredictability.<br />
<br />
Art: Fair 6.<br />
<br />
This would have been much better if there were some ecchi in it like panty shots and nipple flashes, but Ichiko&#039;s fanservice will suffice. Momiji on the other hand should have sported the same school uniform of that of Ichiko, she would have look nice in it, but to distinguish her from the others, she should don her school uniform in an unpressed and messy manner and she would have looked a bit hotter if she&#039;ll be wearing shoes ( in a pair, not one shoe in one foot) without socks. As for Ranmaru, I don&#039;t like her boyish attire, she should have sported  the same school uniform, but to give her that delinquent look, she&#039;ll have to wear her shirt completely unbuttoned still showing her bandage like brassier of some kind and she can maintain the hat and keep that wooden sandal thingy that serves as her footwear. But, when she was given make over, I really find her cute, too bad she went back to wearing the old boy&#039;s school uniform.     <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound:Good 7.<br />
<br />
I simply like the opening theme,titled &quot;Make my day&quot; by Piko.<br />
<br />
So:<br />
<br />
 Dakara one way, two way, three way, four way <br />
Go way! Go way! Saa you! Make my day! <br />
sonna muzukashii koto ka? <br />
one way, two way, three way, four way! No way! No way! <br />
mou goodbye! bad day! <br />
omou mama ni kowashiteyuke <br />
<br />
dareka no reeru no ue kara <br />

<br />
Are you ready? <br />
<br />
dakara one way, two way, three way, four way <br />
Go way! Go way! saa you! Make my day! <br />
sonna muzukashii koto ka? <br />
one way, two way, three way, four way No way! No way! <br />
mou goodbye! bad day! <br />
omou mama ni <br />
<br />
nani mo kamo ga ureshikutte <br />
mukai kaze wa doko kara fuku no? <br />
ganjigarame uzumaku sadame wo <br />
kowashiteyuke<br />
<br />
Btw, I can&#039;t believe that Piko is a dude with a girly voice.<br />
<br />
Characters: Good 7.<br />
<br />
Ok, so for Ichiko I kind like her character where she is this bitchy girl whose world turned upside down when Momiji came into her life. I really like Momiji&#039;s role of that of a bungling deity who can&#039;t seem to do anything right, but what I really like is her transformation when she was given a good scrubbing and rinsing when she attempted to do something but failed to Ichiko. As for Kieta, I would really like it if there is that Keita X Ranmaru arc since the 2 look good being together....that is if Ranmaru would be in a proper girl&#039;s school uniform. Boobi and Moomo may just be in a supporting role, but boy, do they provide the laughs. There is of course this  Nadeshiko Adenokouji, seems to be more of a cameo than anything else.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment and overall: Good 7.<br />
<br />
It really enjoying, in fact in the forums there are rumors of a season 2 brewing, I guess we&#039;ll find out soon. But, you know to see such comedy like this is something that one would be glued on, co&#039;z of the surprise that this anime provides, so overall, if there will be a season 2.... well, why not? If this anime was able to gives us the laughs and the joy of an unusual relationship between Momiji, Ichiko and Ranmaru, co&#039;z the kind of relationship they have is that of a friendenemy type than a usual friendship kind of thingy. I do hope if there will be a season 2, that Keita would have an arc with Ranmaru.

    Poverty Gods. Gods of Destitution.. Ever heard of them before? <br />
I hadn&#039;t. It&#039;s ridiculous and you wouldn&#039;t think they would be able to actually make a coherent plot that has a moral behind it using them. However, I was positively surprised. <br />
<br />
<br />
After reading the synopsis I wasn&#039;t really excited about starting it and the over the top voice acting and character depiction wasn&#039;t that attractive in the first couple of episodes. Give it a chance though and you won&#039;t be disappointed. <br />
<br />
<br />
The ludicrous anime references that vary from Death Note to DBZ will keep you engaged and watching out for the next one. The pacing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181534">
        and flow of the story was enjoyable and allows the viewer to get to know the main characters. The plot is simple but not overly so, together with the well-rounded characters there is good cohesion. <br />
<br />
<br />
The protagonist, Ichiko, has two sides, the one she shows the world and the one that the Poverty God, Momiji, tries to torture to the surface. Ichiko&#039;s character grows and you get to know her background; the development however is cut short because of the length of the anime. The Poverty God herself has more than one side; the wise side that actually tries to help and the slothful sly side that will make you both laugh and face-palm.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Materialistic things alone will never make you truly happy; shutting every one out because you got hurt once will leave you depressed and alone. That pretty much sums up this anime. I wouldn&#039;t give Binbougami ga! points for originality, besides the Gods of Destitution part. <br />
<br />
<br />
I needed an anime to contrast all the psychological stuff I&#039;ve been watching and stumbled across Binbougami ga!. With its characters&#039; silly innuendos, fights and over the top voice acting it was a pleasant break from all the seriousness. <br />
If you&#039;re looking for a few good laughs, I recommend this anime. Its outrageousness is definitely entertaining.  <br />

    Well what can I say.. I&#039;ve watched all episodes and I must confess I rolled on the floor laughing at most of the puns exhibited. Usual comedy series involve someone having a quarrel with another one which escalates into hilarious scenes like throwing him into the atmosphere or hitting someone with a one ton hammer. Binbougami has all this plus the powers of a goddess.. and you know what that means?... it means limitless ideas for pranks jokes as well as other stuff.<br />
<br />
Whats there not to like?<br />
<br />
It is like a game of cat and mouse. The cat tries to catch the mouse but fails in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review83465">
        an amusing way.<br />
It may not be a classical but I believe it can rival Tom&amp;Jerry since the whole idea of the series is to make you laugh.<br />
<br />
I sincerely hope you will enjoy this anime and laugh untill you burst into tears and eventually dying of too much amusement.

    Four episodes into this show and I have laughed during pretty much every single one. The parodies and jokes mixed with the antics are quite refreshing. The back and forth war between a God of Misfortune and a girl with Unlimited Good Fortune is so far pretty funny.  <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been watching anime for a good solid 15 years and have watched a lot of different series and genres. Most of the time when a new comedy series starts up its funny for the first or second episode but gradually loses its edge and returns to its pigeon hole. Though its too early to tell

          <span style="display: none;" id="review67895">
        if this will suffer the same fate as series past I think its safe to assume it will still carry the great comedy throughout its run.

    “Are You Sure You Haven&#039;t Confused Being a God of Flat-Brokeness with Being a God of Flat-Chestedness?”<br />
<br />
I literally picked this anime at random from my collection and couldn’t have been more pleasantly surprised.  Binbougami ga! (Good Luck Girl!) is a pure slapstick, in your face comedic anime with plenty of laughs and morals alike to be explored.  It is not meant to be over analyzed or dissected for any means… and can be fervently enjoyed by any anime fan looking to take a break from the serious stuff.<br />
<br />
Let’s be honest, I’m not watching this anime for the story.  Ichiko Sakura is a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195144">
        seemingly perfect girl who just happens to be so lucky that she virtually absorbs other people’s happiness energy.  A “Poverty God” Momiji is sent to earth to restore the imbalance of happiness energy by taking out Ichiko.  Not a lot more than that as far as plot goes.  Comedic quarrels ensue as Momiji realizes just what she’s up against.  She ends up having to recruit the help of a few of her demon friends to try and get the job done. <br />
<br />
The writing isn’t all bad, however.  As Ichiko interacts more and more with Momiji, she begins to emerge from her shell of innocence.  She’s literally been fed from a silver spoon her whole life, but learns there’s more to happiness than having money and good looks.  The morals that surface from the story become apparent through each episode.  I also enjoyed the random satire elements involving other well known animes such as Deathnote and Dragonball Z thrown in.  It helped emphasize the ridiculousness of the scenario at hand.  <br />
<br />
The fast paced, hilarious dialogue between the characters is one of the major selling points of this anime.  Ichiko, or “Titchiko” as she’s often referred to for her enormous breasts is likeable yet unlikeable protagonist.  At first you hate her selfish, holier-than-thou attitude, but begin to understand her more as the show moves on.  It’s funny how she always finds a way to sneak out of every attempt for Momiji to steal her happiness.  I guess by default Momiji would be considered the villain of the show, but serves to be much more than that.  Her companion bear, Kumagai, with the creepy ass face is also priceless, always trying to assist Momiji even if her goals are ridiculous.   <br />
<br />
There’s also a random Black perverted monk, Bobby who enjoys grabbing girl’s breasts while yelling “titties!”, a dog-humanoid demon that’s into bondage, and a pink-haired tomboy obsessed with karate.  Did I mention how outrageous this show is???  Each character adds a unique piece of hilarity with their ridiculous personal qualities.  The sarcastic attitude of Ichiko’s semi-love interest Keita balances out the outlandish personalities really well, sometimes even putting an abrupt stop to the scene.  Great comedy.  <br />
<br />
Nothing noteworthy here, just your standard over-the-top sound effects and an eclectic soundtrack to go along with it.  The artwork is pretty stylish, and looks great in 720p.  Lots of color and detail in the environments, and plenty of props given to the character designs… I mean not a lot of shows can produce a poop demon.  The opening and ending were quite catchy, and gave the eyes a lot to ogle at as far as fanservice goes.  I watched the series in English and full marks can be given to the entire cast of voice actors, each voice was over the top in its own right… it kind of reminded me of Excel Saga with the exception of Excel herself.  <br />
<br />
I normally don’t grade this section individually, but I can truly say standard grading doesn’t do the anime justice.  I’ve seen my fair share of humorous animes, but some of the scenes in Binbougami ga! were so ridiculous, I found myself laughing a few times in every episode.  It was unlike any show I had seen before in regards to delivery.  It’s very quick-witted, and gut punching comedy.  I was actually a bit sad when the anime ended, and look forward to checking out the manga when I have some more time. <br />
<br />
Overall, Good Luck Girl is one original show.  It may not be the best in any one category, or invoke philanthropic debates, but I did enjoy the hell out of it.  I recommend this anime to anyone who needs a break from serious plots or someone who enjoys a good laugh.  Thanks for reading the review!         <br />

    Srry this is my first review so It won&#039;t be very good:)) and I&#039;ll try not to spoil anything.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m gonna write a review this time for the manga and currently running anime, Bindougami ga!. The  manga started in 2008 in Jump SQ and the anime is currently airing in the Summer 2012 season.<br />
<br />
So far I gotta say this series has been a big surprise. I never took notice of this series until the anime started airing and from the look of the manga&#039;s scalation releases, so did most other people. This series is like a small hidden gem that not many people will take

          <span style="display: none;" id="review91641">
        notice of.<br />
<br />
The story premise is simple. Momiji is a lazy, rude and flat-chested Poverty God who carries bad luck whose mission is to fix the &quot;imbalance&quot; in the world caused by Sakura Ichiko; a girl who is considered blessed in every way, brains, beauty and even brawns but have a two-faced, near rotten personality.  Ichiko is very lucky, too lucky; she&#039;s even stealing luck from the people surrounding her. Momiji has to stop her from stealing people&#039;s luck and to make her a regular human, but it was tougher than expected and so the battle between God and Girl begins .<br />
<br />
Now at first this seems like a really regular setting for a manga, well sort of. I didn&#039;t expect it to be a slapstick comedy though and to be true, I was pleasantly surprise by it . The series hits me with a very forward style of humor that constantly keeps me on my feet. Most of the comedy comes from the interactions between the cast of characters, at first from mostly the clashes between Momiji and Ichiko but later on from other characters as well. Another aspect of humor is references made by the characters(mostly Momiji) towards other manga and animes, such as One Piece and Dragon Ball and I even saw Doraemon and To-Love-Ru in there. I even thought that they were doing &quot;It&#039;s Over 900000&quot; before I realized in Japan the meme wasn&#039;t that famous.<br />
<br />
Now and then there are a few dramatic moments in the series which helps to show the other sides of the cast; such as Ichiko being a lonely and misunderstood girl behind her two-faces and Momiji, who&#039;s suppose to be extremely ruthless in her mission to be more compassionate and caring towards her target and rival. They also serve the purpose of progressing the story of the series rather than making it completely filled with jokes and humor. This is a similar formula to a lot of mangas and animes, such as Sora no Otoshimono and Ranma1/2. <br />
<br />
The most important aspect of the series is the cast, which is the main course of the whole thing. At first you are introduced to the I guess main pair of the series, the God &amp; Girl rivals, Momiji and Ichiko. Their personality couldn&#039;t be more far apart and that is what drives the series at first. As the series progresses, more character are introduced, with many different personalities and archetypes and this diversifies the moods  of the series.  They&#039;re also well developed as most of them had their share of personal back story and dramatic moments that helps them bond with each other, from both the main and supporting characters.<br />
<br />
There isn&#039;t a lot of ecchi elements to the series and they&#039;re mostly used for laughs rather than fanservice (well it maybe fanservice for some) and it mostly involves poking fun at either Ichiko&#039;s breast, Momiji&#039;s lack of breast, some small S&amp;M and perverted fantasies by the series&#039; resident perverts.<br />
<br />
The most striking thing and maybe most obvious thing in this cat and mouse game between Momiji and Ichiko all the ironies in it. First is that since Momiji carries a lot of bad luck with her, so really every plan that she hatches against Ichiko will likely fail. Second and maybe the biggest irony of all is that Ichiko was never really happy in her life even though she was blessed with everything; and maybe the real blessing granted upon her, was the God of Misfortune meant to make her life miserable, may actually make her happy.<br />
<br />
I recommend this series to everyone, you may have to give it a couple of chapters or 1-2 episodes, but trust me you won&#039;t regret it.<br />

    Ichigo Sakura is a egotistical girl who seems to have it all; beauty, wealth, intellegence, and athleticism. However this imbalance causes those around her to suffer. It&#039;s up to Momiji, a poverty god, to put things back into order by sucking Ichigo&#039;s happiness energy out of her. Despite her determination, Ichigo won&#039;t give up so easily. Now Ichigo has to put up with Momiji&#039;s crazy antics and bad luck devices, along with her supernatural lunatic friends.<br />
<br />
Good Luck Girl is hilarious supernatural comedy with a bunch of parody jokes thrown in. These parodies include series such as Rosario Vampire, Dragon Ball, One Piece, and many more!

          <span style="display: none;" id="review193880">
        The anime doesn&#039;t take itself seriously, which is a good thing. It even often makes fun of itself and even anime in general. The story wasn&#039;t too serious, but there was still a plot to follow which made room for many jokes to be thrown in. This is definitely the series for you if you already have watched a good share of anime, so you can get most of the jokes and humor thrown into it.<br />
<br />
The animation was very eye catching and alluring. Of course it wasn&#039;t the best animation I&#039;ve seen, but it still deserves some props. The character designs were very interesting, especially Momiji&#039;s, and it reeally encompases what a poverty god would look like. Also, the art and animation in the opening were fantasticc, and had a pop art feel to it, which really drew me in. The animation was very fluent and neat throughout.<br />
<br />
First of all, I would reccomend the dub for this series. I feel like there is much more to get out of it while watching the dub. The english voice actors were amazing, as to be expected by actors such as Todd Haberkorn (Momou Inugami) and Brina Palencia (Ichigo Sakura). They seemed to act very natural as if they were experiencing the situations themselves, especially the conversations between Ichigo and Momiji. The whole cast did an amazing job, and the voices matched the characters perfectly.<br />
<br />
The sound track for this anime was absolutely spectacular in my opinion, especially the opening song, &#039;Make My Day&#039; by Pico. It was very fitting, and the opening animation matched the song spectacularly. It was very upbeat and fun, just like the series was. <br />
<br />
Each character showed significance and development in this story. Ichigo especially, as she shows a well amount of character development throughout the series. They gave an interesting approach to her character. I expected her to be absolutely despicable and a total brat wwho bullied otthers. However being a dislikeable character, she was different than expected. She actually had no friends or group, and she never really bulied anyone, in fact, she was the one who was being bullied. It was a very unique approach and they really pulled it off.<br />
<br />
The other characters in this series were also very interesting and were extremely likeable. Characters like Momiji, Bobby, and Momou, made me laugh out loud several times such as the time were Bobby and Momou sang a song about boobs, or when Momiji cosplays characters from other anime. These characters were extremely loveable and most definitely fun to watch.<br />
<br />
Overall, Good Luck Girl gets a 9 out of 10 for personal enjoyment, laugh out loud moments, and cast of characters that were quite loveable. This show was definitely a feel good show, and definitely a show to watch if you feel a bit down or upset. Even just the opening could cheer you up! Or at least &#039;Make Your Day&#039;. Haha, get it? Anyways, this show is perfect for those who have watched a good amount of anime, and enjoy some laid back humor and a happy tone.

    Well  this is my second review I&#039;ve written and I hope it will be of good use.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as I have seen of the first epi this could be well be a really nice anime too watch this summer. The story is also interesting at least better then some of the other&#039;s I&#039;ve seen for this summer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well the story is about this INCREDIBLE lucky girl apparently that has too much luck for her own good so the god of misfortune is sent to get a good load of luck from her and make her like any of us unlucky on the world. At first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review66211">
        glance the main charachter seems to be the normal type of populair girl with big breasts and nice charachte  but in reality she&#039;s a *****.<br />
The god of misfortune finds this out the hard way and u can already guess what happens next, Yes a shitload of funny scenes and weird ass moments. Also I must note that I really like the fact that theyre making fun of different anime&#039;s just like they do in gintama. The show also has a few drama moments but are quickly changed from depressing/cry/emo moments too Lol wtf funny moments<br />
<br />
Overall I think this just might be one of the most enjoyable and funny  anime&#039;s that summer has brought us. Seeing as I have watched half of them and only 4 of them were actually good so far and this is one of those 4<br />
<br />
Grade 7<br />
<br />

    What would you do if you had all the luck in the world, but only because you&#039;d been leeching the luck and happiness off of the people around you? Well, you&#039;d probably feel at least a little guilty, but you can&#039;t help it, right? If there&#039;s no way to fix the problem then there&#039;s nothing you can do.<br />
This is the way our protagonist Ichiko Sakura approaches her situation, but there is an easy fix for her problem - she just won&#039;t take it because she&#039;s incredibly selfish. Ichiko herself was one of the main problems I had with the show as it tried desperately to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review240773">
        justify her selfishness and make her likeable; if it had left her one-dimensional and unashamedly selfish I think I would&#039;ve enjoyed the show a lot more, but as it was I hated her as a character and I hated when other characters would give into her because they saw her &#039;true self&#039; instead of just outright being beaten in order to solve the conflict. <br />
So what about the other characters, then? The show (wisely) doesn&#039;t decide to try and flesh them out or justify them like it does with Ichiko and instead mines their few character traits for jokes every second they&#039;re on screen, whether it&#039;s with the perverted monk or the masochistic dog. The jokes aren&#039;t very original but if you already watch anime regularly they shouldn&#039;t be anything more than mildly uncomfortable at worst, and who knows? Jokes about groping, BDSM and being flat-chested may be your thing - I won&#039;t judge. <br />
The rest of the comedy comes from a mixture of slapstick and references to other anime which got a few smirks out of me personally, but comedy is subjective so your mileage may vary. <br />
All-in-all I found the show pretty entertaining and I particularly liked the last 2-3 episodes, but there were bumps here and there that threw me a little and the humor wasn&#039;t entirely my thing so I can&#039;t say I loved the show or that I could recommend it as a must-watch. Good Luck Girl! isn&#039;t anything groundbreaking and if you don&#039;t subscribe to its particular brand of comedy there isn&#039;t much for you here, but as something to turn your brain off to it suits its purpose fine.  <br />

    Surely a familiar taste of anime, over the top and crazy.  But when you bite into this sundae of madness there is a certain spice about it.  That spice is the main protag!  If it wasn&#039;t for the antagonist, then she&#039;d be stealing the show.  Typical &#039;do-gooder&#039;? Nah.  She is probably one of the meanest and most selfish protagonists ever and she makes sure to let those who appall her, give them a reason too.  But the main character isn&#039;t the only great thing about this show.  The other characters are very fun and likable and, over the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review75531">
        course of the anime, very very well developed.  The only thing I could say that was meh (but still love it regardless), were the myriad of references to other anime.  I like being the guy to point out &quot;Holy smokes they just referenced that!&quot;, but I do think they overdid it.  It still doesn&#039;t stray from the story of the anime though, not at all.  One of those few goofy anime with a storyline, Binbougami ga! is a beautiful syringe amongst a haystack of gold.
