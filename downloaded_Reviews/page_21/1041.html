    (This review may contain Spoilers. Please do not read until you&#039;ve watched the whole season.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Go Princess Precure (or GoPri for simplicity) is my second watched season of the Precure franchise. It was a phenomenal time of my watchthrough of Precure. Having just come out of Heartcatch, one of the best seasons of the franchise, this season had big shoes to fill. And oh boy, did this season smash it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
Going into the season, I thought this season will have a more simplistic and direct story without too many surprises. But partially why I love this season is exactly that. The story is themed around hopes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339799">
        and dreams and the main character Haruka&#039;s desire to be a princess- But a different kind of princess.<br />
Now, before I watched the season I scoffed at the idea of princesses being the design theme. But that&#039;s because I didn&#039;t know the depth of the theme. Princess, in this series, is sort of referring to Cures growing into someone mature, hopeful, and full of aspiration. This is a very intricate and marvelous surprise the season gave to me.<br />
A clever theme like this must come with good development and good slice of life. Indeed, the show did well in both aspects, utilizing each character and suspense very well. The dynamics of the Cures are excellent, and the show is just brimming with amazing and emotional scenes.<br />

Art: 10/10<br />
You all know what time it is. XD<br />
GoPri is extremely praised for having the greatest animation in the entire Precure franchise. The detail, the mood, the designs, the fights, EVERYTHING! It is done to near perfection. I was absolutely impressed by how beautiful everything is, not to mention the Cure designs. They might be a bit over the top sometimes but mostly they&#039;re truly gorgeous.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
The sounds are great this season, but its importance pails in comparison to the background music. Some of the most iconic tracks are the violin motifs from Prince Kanata and Princess Towa. Another great track is Conditions of Being a Princess. Fantastic stuff in this department.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character: 9.5/10<br />
Everyone&#039;s character development in GoPri is amazing. All of them have their dreams and aspirations very fleshed out. The suspense and problems the Cures face are portrayed well, they are quite realistic and relatable in some moments. Heck, even the fairy episode this season isn&#039;t half bad.<br />
Minami and Kirara, as mentioned, have greatly fleshed out developments toward their dreams and bring out many valuable lessons in correspondence to the theme. One tiny problem though, perhaps it is that which made their arcs not as eye-catching than the other two despite how good their lessons are.<br />
Meanwhile, Haruka and Towa both have insanely powerful arcs and that made them extremely lovable and admirable characters. Haruka&#039;s story is bubbling with life and joy, and Towa&#039;s is an amazing roller coaster of emotions. Their determination makes them some of the best Cures of the franchise in my opinion. Add onto the fact that they&#039;re super friendly while casual, yet fierce and awesome in battle? Just perfect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
The light-heartedness of the story and how bubbly everyone&#039;s personalities are both truly wonderful to see. The occasional suspense is on point, especially when pretty much every Cure experienced an identity crisis during the show.<br />
And may I take a moment to praise THE FIGHT SCENES! This season, in combination with the best animation of the franchise, also delivers some of the most beautiful (And maybe the most unrealistic due to their extravagant dresses and hair) fight scenes. I am a sucker for fight scenes and Cure Flora&#039;s performance right off the bat got me in the ring. The others? Of course, they don&#039;t lose either.<br />
It&#039;s just an extraordinary blend of action, pleasantness, tears, and ecstasy. And I adore it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 9.6/10 (Rounded up for convenience)<br />
Go Princess Precure prints a revolutionary picture of what it means to be a Princess and the theme of aspirations and dreams in my mind. Everything is done to almost perfection- The story, the music, the art, the characters. Truly, I see this season as one of the pinnacles of Precure in its entirety.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But don&#039;t take my word for it- You may all have your own judgment!

    Dreams are beautiful and worth protecting, something that moves forward people and gives us a goal to reach in our way to happiness. Poor/unappealing execution and disliking the characters aside, the theme of &quot;working hard to reach your dreams&quot; is one of the most compelling ones there is to me, and well, here is an anime where the characters having a dream and the enemy trying to take them away is the main theme! I was already hooked from the start, and the execution couldn&#039;t have been better.<br />
<br />
“I want to be a princess!” Said our clumsy, but hardworking and absurdly lovable protagonist Haruka when she

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289233">
        was a kid, the rest laughed at her for having such childish dream, maybe you did you too after reading this thinking about how absurd that might be, but that hurt her, a lot. Thankfully, one day she met a mysterious person who looked like a prince and he cheered for her dream and that she could become one, and that moment is what pushed her to stay that way and continue having that dream she wanted to reach all the way to when she joined Noble Academy, a school where this fantastic story is set.<br />
<br />
In this entry, the antagonist side is an organization called Dysdark, that focuses on bringing despair to the people by locking away their dreams (and them in the process inside of a cage), they already showed their power by taking full control of Hope Kingdom and the people living there, with the few who managed to run away asking the Precures of this entry for help. While some comedic interactions with the girls are still there, I have to say that Princess clearly went more serious when it comes to showing the villains as the evil force they are, and how threatening Dyspear (the main antagonist of the story) is definitely helps on that.<br />
<br />
And this is where the Precure come to action, and what a nice job they made, the cast of this anime is so likeable and this is especially true for the main characters of this story and Yui, another student who isn&#039;t a Precure but is always with the girls, we follow them in their way to accomplish their dreams and this includes all the happy, sad, and very emotional moments of that, it&#039;s so easy to root for them and each episode is really enjoyable no matter who takes the spotlight, I was hooked to this anime from the first episode and it only made but get better, reaching godlike status in the last cour where it became a string of amazing episode after amazing episode into a conclusion that left me immensely satisfied.<br />
<br />
The animation of the series is fantastic, especially delivering hard in the transformations and action scenes that are characteristic of the series, it&#039;s honestly surprising how consistent the quality is considering that Precure never really stops airing. <br />
<br />
With that said, it&#039;s time to tackle the only negative I can think of this anime: some use of the CGI. Together with the “real life looking” issue I have with the toys the franchise obviously wants to advertise to keep going as mentioned in my Heartcatch Precure review, the magic spells and the CGI models that come along with them can be pretty jarring, but it really becomes a minor complaint when everything else in the series was just so great.<br />
<br />
The series is also very solid in the music department, and god, I love the second ED of the series so much even if having the issue I mentioned, it&#039;s a great song and it also has different versions (one for each of the Precure), alternating between them, most of the time fitting with who was the main focus of the episode, it was unskippable and a fantastic way to end the episode.<br />
<br />
Princess Precure is no anime “just for kids”, the themes of the story and how well they are handled are made in a way that anyone can enjoy this anime and feel connected with the cast and their dreams, maybe also being able to relate with your own ones and feel an extra push for your objectives. One of the best series I have watched and an anime I can&#039;t recommend enough to everyone.

    I&#039;ve always loved Precure transformations and have always looked forward to them every year despite not watching the full series since I was afraid it would be too childish and I would just waste my time. However, I decided to give it a try with Go! Princess Precure and I am SO glad I did. <br />
<br />
As I&#039;m writing this, I literally just want to boast this anime and say it&#039;s a masterpiece and that everyone in the world should watch it, and that&#039;s truly how I feel about it cause that&#039;s how much I personally enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
This anime is just a surprise every episode. You

          <span style="display: none;" id="review209984">
        think you&#039;re getting yourself into some boring cutesy anime aimed at children, and while it is aimed at children, there are so many themes treated (mainly about dreams) and they&#039;re obviously not crude or hardcore, but they can touch you and I&#039;m not ashamed to say I cried multiple times throughout the series. <br />
<br />
The animation is just great. There are very few episodes where the quality decreases, but even so they never fail to deliver amazing fight scenes and gorgeous magical girl powers. Some episodes probably have one of the most amazing animation of 2015, and you&#039;ll be surprised to see such details and smoothness in an anime like this. <br />
<br />
The music fit the anime really well. The OST really does sound like something out of a princess movie, so the princess theme is very recurrent and never feels out of place. Take a listen to the transformation music and you&#039;ll know what I&#039;m talking about. <br />
<br />
Overall I gave the anime a 10 because I can honestly say this is the best magical girl anime I&#039;ve ever seen. It might be an exaggeration to some, but I felt so good each and every episode and I really don&#039;t feel like giving it any less. It deserves everything. <br />
<br />
Give it a chance, you won&#039;t regret it for a second.

    Go! Princess Precure was a hard thing to pick up given that my preferences - while being variant with genres like Horror, psychological, comedy, slice of life, mecha, sci-fi, sports, shounen etc prominent - never really had the Mahou (magical)  part. However Princess Precure is more than just pretty girls being super powerful and awesome. But before I tackle what is the anime&#039;s theme (I don&#039;t mean the story/synopsis) I would like to convey one thing strongly. Go! Princess Precure is not targeted towards a mature audience and so don&#039;t expect it to appeal in such a manner.<br />
<br />
The anime is meant for a younger

          <span style="display: none;" id="review209977">
        audience, regardless of gender and should be appreciated as such. That doesn&#039;t mean a grown up CANNOT enjoy it (I am 23 and I loved it) but one has to keep in mind what the anime is about and for whom does it deliver. Which brings me back to my main discussion. Princess Precure is saturated with positive themes. It&#039;s basic premise would be to follow your dreams no matter how hard it is. Alongside it gives many other valuable lessons regarding friends, family, and understanding people. It shows us that the struggle for our dreams may be tough but still we struggle because we dream. And that is the beauty as well as the crux of the anime.<br />
<br />
Now since it is for kids, it does not border on themes that are surely part of real life but may be hard for kids to understand or might have a negative impact on them and so we have no adult style jokes, no deliberate sarcasm, no politics (back stabbing and what not). And of course we have a long transformation. However that doesn&#039;t mean we have a bland story with no ups and downs. There is tension, there is anticipation, there are rather quite thrilling scenes. <br />
<br />
The pacing is well done - it doesn&#039;t move the story too fast for it to confuse or too slow for it to bore. The animation is good - it is over all a vibrant and smooth display and where the anime wishes to deliver, it delivers beautifully with intense fighting scenes (no blood or gore though). The sounds are complimenting though I didn&#039;t find anything excessively outstanding about it. The characters do adhere to certain specific traits but honestly, given that it was for kids, excessive 3-D personality build would be unsuitable. That is not to say that the characters are just dumb projections - they play their part well.<br />
<br />
So if one understands that the anime is in essence a lesson targeting mainly kids, then anyone can enjoy it. It has a lot to offer and plot wise it handles things very well leaving a memorable experience. I hope you enjoy it!

    First of all, lets talk about the story. Disney and sometimes Mattel with Barbie, makes stories with princesses, so... Can precure make something new with these theme? And yes, Toie with this season of precure made a fresh story with &quot;princess&quot; in it. I can admit that the story is adictive. At the beginning the story was a bit slow, but when Twilight, a villian in the saga appears, things will get better and better.<br />
<br />
The story always remember us the important of dreams and the impoortance of make them true. The enemy, Dyspair wants to make dispair of that dreams. The dreams will be always

          <span style="display: none;" id="review210491">
        have this bad feeling. Broken dreams, the not aproval of the people we love... Other precure series have touched the theme of dreams, but only of the main characters. This time Go! Princess precure will tocuh the dreams of all people, and that&#039;s good, because we see all kinds of dreams, and how people fight to see those dreams true. <br />
<br />
Characters: The case of Haruno Haruka. This character can be the admiration of little girls. When she see something she likes, she wants to learn that: Ballet, violin, how to make a dress. Yes, at the beginning she discovers that its difficult fut she never abandosn what she begin.<br />
<br />
In general, character development is really good. They have doubts, own dreams and defects. They commit mistakes and reject them, and finally they learn something important, not only about their own dreams, they learn about friendship , team work, etc.<br />
<br />
The music is ok. Only that. The Op is good enough and you can remember it well. Both endings are really good. The music that stands out is the violin. Not only because is the main weapon of one of the precures, is an important instrument on the series.<br />
<br />
 Toei is really improving in CGI animation. Now the attack and sometimes the transformation sequence have that kind of animation and it looks really great. Maybe it is too shiny sometimes, but and can maybe you can get tired of it, but in the second ED it will change and it loos better. The 2D animation is average, at my opinion. Sometimes will go bad, but in general it doesn;t have any mistakes.<br />
<br />
In overall and enyoiment was really great. A fan of precure can enjoy the anime. It is better that other precure series. And if you are not a fan, is a good season to begin or to watch.

    My favourite precure series that Toei has to offer. It&#039;s so soft and cute but has just the right amount of self-doubt and angst to make it not too kiddy like to watch. Haruka the main character is honestly so likeable. She brings everyone together but not in a forced way, everyone wants to be her friend because of what a sweetie pie she is. The entire anime has an overall goal which is super nice. They&#039;re working towards one big goal of achieving their dreams. <br />
It also deals with the fact that peoples dream/career choices change which is something super reassuring to hear from

    Go! Princess Precure was my first Precure series ever. This series is probably the best or one of the best precure series out there, the story, the art, the action... Its all amazing.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Go! Princess Precure&#039;s story is very generic for a magical girl series. Its about a girl who dreams of becoming a princess... Which seems very basic and sounds like a story for 5 year olds (well... It is aimed at kids) but it is really enjoyable and fun... There are some moments where there are filler episodes and some of them are not very good, but over all, it has a good plot,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274042">
        the ending was not an ordinary &quot;Happily ever after&quot; kinda and teaches us that things aren&#039;t always happy.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation:<br />
The art of this series is colourful and vibrant. The animation is sometimes amazing and sometimes horrible, usually in between, the major events and fights though has incredible animation, making 2D drawings seem like they&#039;re in 3D space. The CGI was fine and it didn&#039;t really bother me at all, the transformation sequence was amazing and was done by Naotoshi Shida (One of the best, if not the best animators in Toei Animation) which gives it extra bonuses. The fights are action packed and very fun to watch, its violent but doesn&#039;t really have blood and all that stuff that can scare little kids.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The music in this series is great, the transformation music is very active and makes you want to dance and jump around. The opening was catchy and enjoyable. The times where they were in a bit of trouble, the music was action packed and seemed like a very strong way of letting us know that.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
The characters in my opinion were great. They had amazing development just in the early episodes. They learn throughout the story and change. The fairies even had character development themselves, unlike some other magical girl series where the mascot thing or creatures remained the same the entire series.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall:<br />
This is my own personal opinion but I absolutely enjoyed this series, it&#039;s what got me to the precure franchise. I can&#039;t really say anything else but go watch it yourself as everyone&#039;s opinion is different.

    Confession time: when I was little, I absolutely HATED girly things. Well, my mom says I played with a lot of Barbie dolls when I was a kid, but other than that, I hated anything remotely girly. I still hate dresses and skirts to this day though only because of sensory issues, I didn&#039;t watch shows like My Little Pony, Bratz, or anything of the like when I was young, I despise makeup because I don&#039;t like the way it feels on my skin, and I used to think that all shows for girls were bad and were all about pretty princesses who did nothing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review209798">
        but giggle at nothing, have endless tea parties, and cry over the stupidest things...and I&#039;m a girl! I was VERY into shows like Pokemon, Digimon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Monster Rancher, Codename: Kids Next Door, Danny Phantom, etc. Anything that had cute monsters saving the world and characters who weren&#039;t archetypes and that had compelling stories were a win for me! Admittedly, I did watch the English dubs of Tokyo Mew Mew and Ojamajo Doremi back when 4Kids was still around, but I just considered them good shows. When one of my favorite bloggers was praising a show called Heartcatch Precure up the wazoo, I got curious and decided to watch it...and I&#039;m glad I did, because it completely changed my perception of shows for girls, and this was BEFORE My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic came around! Now, if you were to tell me ten years ago that I would fall head over heels for a show called Go! Princess Pretty Cure, I would have called you stupid. But here I am, loving Go! Princess Pretty Cure in all its frilly, cutesy, pink, princess-y glory!<br />
<br />
Haruka Haruno has always dreamed of being a princess, even at age 13. When she was young, a boy named Kanata gave her a strange pink key, telling her that she can fulfill her dream. Years later, she transfers to an elite middle school called Noble Academy in the hopes of becoming a fine young lady. When she meets two fairies, Puff and Aroma, they&#039;re being chased by Close and his monster, a Zetsuborg. Strangely, the key she&#039;s held onto winds up turning her into a magical girl, Cure Flora. As it turns out, Puff and Aroma are fairies from the Hope Kingdom, which is being conquered by an evil lady named Dyspear and her minions. The prince, Kanata, is trying to help however he can and needs 12 Princess Keys in order to get Hope Kingdom back. Joining them are calm natured do-gooder Minami Kaido, Cure Mermaid, and sassy, upbeat model Kirara Amanogawa, Cure Twinkle, and later, the revived princess of Hope Kingdom, Towa, aka Cure Scarlet. Can they defeat DysDark and save both their world and Hope Kingdom?<br />
<br />
The animation is a major step-up from Happiness Charge. It looks so much more clearer, the movements are more fluid, the transformation sequences are just brimming with life, and while the CGI does look a teensy bit out of place in places, there are times when its integrated better. I definitely liked the animation for the first ending theme. The second one...not so much. The characters still fall into uncanny valley territory when the CGI is there. The colors are bright and the animation doesn&#039;t have that weird, smoky, murky quality about it that Happiness Charge was plagued with a lot of the time.<br />
<br />
While it&#039;s well known that the Precure series reuse music from other seasons, even when they shouldn&#039;t due to not being connected with each other, Go Princess did have this problem at first. Thankfully, once the second half came, the Doki Doki music disappeared entirely, and what original music it does have does its job well. I do think the insert songs are a bit to peppy and don&#039;t give certain scenes impact, but they&#039;re not bad, and the rest of the music is pretty good as well. The opening theme is definitely a major step-up from Happiness Charge and it doesn&#039;t grate on my ears. The first ending theme is absolutely beautiful, and it sounds more like it&#039;d be in an anime about classical music like Your Lie In April rather than Precure, but it does fit the &quot;want to be a noble princess&quot; theme rather well.<br />
<br />
Again, the characters are also massively improved from Happiness Charge. All of the characters here are endearing and engaging, have reasonable personalities, strengths, weaknesses, and dreams that all come into play in the series, all of them get episodes in the limelight, and no one character outshines another nor is anyone given more importance than the other. Plus, they&#039;re all reasonably developed and aren&#039;t just walking catchphrases meant to shove morals down kids&#039; throats! Even side characters are given focus, and although some could have used better development or were just terrible (I&#039;m looking at you, Ranko!), they all played their part in the show in a good way, and they don&#039;t just disappear when the going gets tough, either. Such is the case for one girl, Yui Nanase, who isn&#039;t a Pretty Cure nor does she fight any enemies physically like Seiji from HapiCha did, but she contributes in her own way, and everyone loves her for it, me being one of those people. Also, the mascots. I thought Aroma would be annoying since he insults Haruka sometimes, but he completely grows out of that, and Puff is the most adorable little puffball ever! The villains are also improved and have MUCH better, more refined personalities than HapiCha&#039;s and aren&#039;t bland archetypes. However, when one of them gets redeemed halfway through the series (You&#039;ll know who I&#039;m talking about), he doesn&#039;t do anything throughout the show, instead being shy and clinging to Siamour all the time. I like him, but I felt the show could have made better use of him, or at the very least made him do something worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Any flaws that the show has are for the most part pretty minor for me. It did have one bad episode that just made me cringe (Episode 37, the one with the school play) at the fact that they&#039;re willing to worsen a kid&#039;s injury just so they can get on with the play rather than do the reasonable thing and have someone replace him, and Ranko was an annoying little hypocrite who ruined everything in her debut episode and got in the way despite telling Kirara not to do the same. However, those were just small problems, and everything else was relatively great. But I won&#039;t lie, this isn&#039;t a show for everyone. It is ridiculously girly, the whole show is riddled with bright colors like pink, yellow, red, and white, there&#039;s large, poofy dresses, the girl characters are unabashedly attached to their dreams, and it can get rather sappy at times. But for me, it wasn&#039;t so sappy that it made me cringe from how girly it was. Show&#039;s like G3 My Little Pony and Lady Lovely Locks relied too much on cuteness, enforcing female gender roles, and overall saccharineness rather than telling a compelling and genuinely entertaining story, or didn&#039;t utilize what potential they did have, which is why they&#039;re either little known or disliked, because they thought that excessive girliness would attract an audience, but it didn&#039;t work. It let its saccharine image drive away potential audiences.<br />
<br />
Normally, shows about princesses, or shows for girls in general, have gotten a lot of backlash over the years because of their low quality and emphasis on being as inhumanely cute and girly and saccharine as possible. Thankfully, this mindset seems to be dying out, both for fans and creators. Lauren Faust created My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic to appeal to people of all genders and ages, and as a result of its strong focus on storytelling and developing its characters, it became the cash cow franchise it is today. Other shows such as Candy Candy, Snow White With The Red Hair, Yona of the Dawn, Miraculous Ladybug, Steven Universe, Madoka Magica, Ever After High, Monster High, and many others, are well loved by audiences because they&#039;re changing the standards for shows for girls: that just because the show is aimed at girls or has princesses or girly elements in it, it doesn&#039;t mean its bad, and if its executed well, it can be loved by anyone or everyone. I can say proudly that Go Princess Pretty Cure completely changed my views on princesses forever.<br />
<br />
If you want to watch a good show with your daughter, little sister, niece, or whoever, Go Princess Pretty Cure is the show for you, and it shows that even in poofy dresses, girls can kick butt!

    Ah, Go! Princess Precure or hencefort GoPri for simplicity. Quite the popular and beloved season for some reason. Most fans say this is one of the if not the best reason. However, some of us believe this is quite the opposite and this is easily the WORST season from the franchise. Why? Just keep reading...<br />
<br />
WARNING: This review has SPOILERS all over! Nothing extreme, but spoilers.<br />
<br />
Story - 4<br />
<br />
The story in GoPri is already one of its weak points. For starters the main structure is exactly the same than in DokiDoki, that aired two years ago. And before you go &quot;But Zettai, every single season from Pretty

          <span style="display: none;" id="review225027">
        Cure follows the same structure&quot; note I don&#039;t mean one or two minor things like having the new Cure join midway. I mean like the whole thing!<br />
<br />
To wit: The first episodes are the various Cures joining with the last one taking extra, then episode 11 has the first big fight with one villain that can transform and is vanquished with the shiny new combination attack, then another new villain fixated into the Pink Cure appears, then said villain eventually gets one big fight halfway, then the Red Cure joins, then we have another decisive battle by episode 30 won with another new combination attack, then we have some more stuff, and finally the finale with the last battle being just the Pink Cure against the final boss. See? They are the EXACT SAME THING. No other season was this bad, not even Smile the uncreative ripoff season.<br />
<br />
On top of that the plot has other issues too, like the plotline being about following your dreams and then giving us one of the dumbest goals possible for the main character, who naturally never gets over this, or anything and everything involving the fourth perfume. Let&#039;s just say the series forgets Scarlet should not exist to begin with and therefore everything involving her just keeps causing giant gaping plotholes.<br />
<br />
I mean, Pretty Cure is for little girls, but that doesn&#039;t mean the plot should be this lazy. Even the terrible DokiDoki was not that bad. At least that tried, which is more GoPri did.<br />
<br />
Art - 6<br />
<br />
The art is alright, and this season had few QUALITY episodes which is surprising. But there are still problems with it. For starters the 3D looks tacky and out of place, like it was bad when HapiCha did it and is bad now. Glad that Maho Girls got over that. Furthermore most battles are lazily animated, with very few punches and kicks and too much finisher and combination attack spam. Somehow these battles are highly praised among the fanbase, dunno why. Also many of the special attacks and finishers are really long, and the canned animation abuse makes the whole thing feel cheap. Though being fair most recent Cure seasons do this, not just GoPri.<br />
<br />
Moving past the animation there are the character designs, and these have issues too. Most are alright, but two stand out as being horrible. I&#039;m talking about Cure Flora and Cure Mermaid like many might have deducted. Flora looks ridiculous with her half-blonde half-pink hair without any rhyme or reason, with her bangs looking like she pasted colored putty on her forehead, while Mermaid has hair that doesn&#039;t look like hair AT ALL and just looks plain creepy. Everyone else looks fine, Dyspear&#039;s ridiculous cleavage keyhole notwithstanding.<br />
<br />
There are also the costume variations. Not only we have Elegant Mode where the girls get longer skirts when using special attacks, presumably to tack on more canned animation, but also each Key meaning special attack gets its own variation on the costume. The problem is these variations all look identical save for one or two accessories and just feel like Toei trying hard to sell extra figurines and costumes, especially after HapiCha actually went and gave everyone two unique extra costumes plus the shared upgrade.<br />
<br />
Sound - 7<br />
<br />
The songs and everything else are fine. The only problems are the OP being slightly longer than usual for yet more resource saving and Haruka&#039;s annoying constant yelling.<br />
<br />
Character  - 2<br />
<br />
And this is where everything fades and crumbles. The cast from this show is terrible, albeit mostly due to Haruka the worst Cure from the franchise.<br />
<br />
Ah, Haruka... Remember when Mana was mocked and derided for being Mana Sue? Well, Haruka is like Mana but without Mana&#039;s few positive traits and made dumber. At least Mana was oddly competent for her Cure color and that made her stand out. Haruka is the generic dumb Pink lead except she can somehow excel at everything if she tries, to unrealistic levels. One early episode was about her making her own party dress AND still doing well in class AND saving the day during the monster of the week battle even though she was really tired. Like they could have made it so she didn&#039;t fight and the other two handled the monster themselves, or fight but only cause problems, but they had to show how Haruka is the greatest thing since sliced bread. There are far more problems but I don&#039;t want to drown this review in spoilers. I&#039;ll just mention like half the episodes revolve entirely or partially about Haruka in some way or another. And here I was thinking this franchise was about friendship and teamwork.<br />
<br />
For the other Cures... Minami is basically Generic Blue Cure. If you saw one Blue Cure before and was not Erika then you saw Minami already. She is smart, leads the student council, has water and ice powers, affinity with water, fears ghosts, and is basically all the previous Blue Cures all together. Very lazy. Kirara is awesome and the only Cure that had some effort put into being unique, and thankfully she&#039;s most popular too. Towa is basically every former enemy turned heroine put together, again showing zero creativity.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast is alright, with Kanata being better than the previous bishounens but still being quite the pointless love interest. The villains are okay but you can tell Close was also the darling from the writers with all the attention he gets. Details would involve spoilers but let&#039;s just say he&#039;s basically Villain Haruka with all the love he gets.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment  - 6<br />
<br />
GoPri is the worst Pretty Cure season. It&#039;s not horrible, but it has the weakest fights, the weakest cast, and the weakest plot. Many things feel recycled from previous seasons and the few exceptions aren&#039;t that great either. The fanbase constantly shiilling it while bashing and deriding the superior HapiCha didn&#039;t help matters either. I suppose it&#039;s fine if you have never seen another Cure season, but then you should start with something good like Fresh and not with this... thing. The franchise is unique because it focuses on tough girls, and the princess motif does not fit one bit with this.<br />
<br />
Overall - 6<br />
<br />
There were some enjoyable moments, Kirara was amazing, and it makes for good mocking material. You could do worse than GoPri, but considering this is the same franchise that had pearls like Splash Star this is quite the downgrade. Avoid unless you love princesses and stock animation battles, or wanna watch everything Pretty Cure for some reason.<br />

    Go! Princess Precure is a treat. Usually, upon my current Precure watching experiences, the shows are either average, garbage, and rarely worth an adult watch. ご (Go) is an exception to most in the Precure category, as I found it very enriching and entertaining.<br />
<br />
	• First of all, let&#039;s talk about the gorgeous sakuga in Go! Princess. I can&#039;t completely vouch for it being a fluidly animated series all the way through, like a Yuasa Masaaki work, but there are three or four episodes where the animation in the fight scenes will blow you away. The director, Yuuta Tanaka, has only one other credited work and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review288249">
        that was on the Heartcatch Precure movie, and Heartcatch is especially known for its brilliant animation, as well as Yoshihiko Umakoshi&#039;s memorable designs. Here&#039;s to hoping that Tanaka will grace us with more badass magical girls in the future.<br />
	<br />
	• I really enjoyed the designs and the voice acting. Miss Shamour and Shut, in particular, were favorites of mine. Each design blooms with expressiveness and color, although the characters are rather simple in motivation and depth. I think that I expressed this enough with the animation segment, but the animation is certainly something to behold.<br />
	<br />
	• Aesthetically, Go! Princess seems to have taken inspiration from Revolutionary Girl Utena: the main girl is going to find her mysterious, fair-haired, tan-skinned prince, but gains enough power herself to save the entire world instead of relying on another person. Except, Haruka gains her power with the dream of becoming a princess instead of vying to become a prince. I thought this message triumphed over Utena&#039;s, in showing young girls that they can be feminine and kick ass as a princess as much as a man could as a prince (a subversion of what we’re taught in classics like Sleeping Beauty).<br />
	<br />
	• With many other Precure shows, I haven&#039;t been a fan of the villains presentation but this one is impressive, in that regard. One criticism that I have is that a villain (that later becomes a Precure) was far more interesting as a bad guy and gets shafted as soon as she joins the trio. It was rather sad to see me be so interested in a dark princess, just to see her become a mouthpiece to clarify that their goal should be to rescue the prince. <br />
	<br />
	• The main theme of this Precure is dreams, and we are beheld with the characters ambitions, mistakes, and triumphs through their pursuit of these, though rather simple. Unlike many other children&#039;s shows, the scenes are not horribly repetitive and unlike it&#039;s predecessor, Happiness Charge Precure, it didn’t seem like a hollow commercial for toys. Yes, there was a toy castle that was used for an attack, but that was not the primary focus of the series. This Precure seemed to care much more about the viewers connection to the characters and the hope that they may be inspired to someday follow their dreams.<br />
	<br />
	• At the moment of publishing this review, I have not finished Heartcatch Precure, which many acclaim to be the best Precure, so by far Go! Princess is the best Precure I&#039;ve seen. Each episode had me glued to the screen, and wanting more. I never got exhausted and bored because I felt that the show was lowering its quality for a younger audience like I have with Smile Precure, Tokyo Mew Mew, and Sailor Moon R. Whether you are a child, teen, or adult I think this is a good show to watch, I give it a 7/10 and much enthusiasm. <br />
	<br />
	• Haruka Haruno, or Cure Flora, leaves us with a haunting last message as she fights the final villain, &quot;Dreams and despair are two sides of the same of the same coin.” A message that is really helpful to teach the young girls, bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, and fervently pursuing a dream, who think their ambitions will be met with nothing but sunshine that there is a reality on the other side of hope. Go! Princess breaks the mold to pass along truthful messages, instead of only pretty colors through glitter and sparkle.

    This is one of the best Precure anime i watched. <br />
<br />
Story (8/10) Princess Precure Trying their best to save people dream<br />
<br />
Art (6/10) I didn&#039;t like Haruka art specially her eyebrows probably the worst eyebrows i seen in anime <br />
<br />
Sound (10/10) Outstanding sound effect and voice actors<br />
<br />
Characters (8/10) I think Yuuki should be main male character not Kanata <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10/10) I really enjoyed this anime more than other Precure anime<br />
<br />
Overall (8/10) It&#039;s Very Good Anime I think they need to make more of it but that not gonna happen because every Precure anime got one season and they replace it with new Precure anime.

    → Sorry for my &quot;not so good&quot; english, my main language is spanish.<br />
<br />
Many people dislike GoPri because of the princess themed plot, some say it&#039;s cringe worthy or bad but ... hear me out, this anime&#039;s target audience is mainly girls from 6 to 11 years old. So yes, no wonder that a teenager/young adult/adult would find this to be a bit to much for them.<br />
PS: I loved this season, it was my entry point to the franchise.<br />
<br />
→ ART &amp; ANIMATION: <br />
/→ This season has some of the best sakuga, fight coroegraphy that i&#039;ve ever seen... but precure is almost always +-50 episodes so no

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337050">
        every fights has that sweet sakuga, just the best ones (the EPs were a new precure appears, boss/sub boss fights).<br />
/→ GoPri has some of the best transformation sequences that i&#039;ve ever seen in precure/anime in general (at the time of writing this i&#039;ve watched GoPri, Heartcatch, Kirakira, and recently started with Smile).<br />
/→ Really strong designs for each of the precures, pre and post henshin, Kirara &amp; Towa being my personal favourites.<br />
<br />
→ OST / Sound: Not bad, OP was good enough, ED1: not bad, ED2: Great Song &amp; beautiful CGI &amp; i loved &quot;Conditions of Being a Princess&quot;.<br />
<br />
→ Characters: Every one that matters gets good enough development but you know how in precure every girl is always some sort of trope, that gets characterization but nothing mind blowing.<br />
PS: Kirara is Best Girl.<br />

                                                   Aim for your dreams. Go! Princess Precure! <br />
<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, this is one my favorite magic girl anime released in a long time.<br />
<br />
Story 7/10 <br />
The story of Go! Princess Precure revolves around three young middle school girls who each have dreams they want to fulfill. Haruka wants to be a princess,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242960">
        Kirara wants to be a model, and Minami is thinking about taking over her parent&#039;s company. Haruka meets Princes Katana, who tells her that she can be a princess and anything she wants to be.<br />
<br />
The world is in trouble though. Dyspear and her minions are looking to steal people&#039;s dreams by locking them up and using their power to destroy the world. Haruka transforms into Cure Flora, and uses her powers to help save the day and restore everyone&#039;s dreams!<br />
<br />
The story was episodic, but I loved this factor. It gave the audience a chance to learn about the dreams of the main and supporting characters, something that helped fuel the story and made the precure&#039;s fight relateable. <br />
<br />
Art 9/10 <br />
I LOVED the art of Go! Princess Precure. From elegant dresses to beautiful transformations, this is by far one of my favorite art styles of all time. I really enjoyed the bright colors of each character and I didn&#039;t really see any mistakes.<br />
<br />
The one thing I didn&#039;t like about the artwork was making some of the weapons look like the toys they were selling, but I can forgive it as Toei is a marketing empire when it comes to selling merchandise!<br />
<br />
Sound 8/10<br />
The soundtrack to this anime is absolutely gorgeous. The violin is the main instrument, which was very princesslike and fitting.<br />
The opening is one of my favorite anime tracks to date. It&#039;s catchy, cute, and fits the show. I never skipped it, and I loved how the opening changed as new things were happening. <br />
<br />
Character 8/10<br />
Every single main character was well developed. I will break down the main ones without spoilers. <br />
<br />
Haruka (Cure Flora): A young girl who works hard at whatever she does, whether it&#039;s learning to be a princess or her high school studies. Personally, I think she is the epitome of what magic girl role models should be: telling girls they need to work hard and believe in themselves. <br />
Kirara (Cure Twinkle): A model who has an incredibly busy schedule, and can sometimes be a little diva. She&#039;s one of the funnest characters in the show, who is just wanting live up to the expectations she has laid out for her.<br />
Minami (Cure Mermaid): The slowest to develop. She&#039;s smart, beautiful, and seemingly perfect; except she doesn&#039;t know what her dream is, and is soul searching for it. <br />
Aroma &amp; Puff: The &quot;Fairies&quot; and the main mascots of the series. They are a butler and maid in training. <br />
Prince Katana: One of the most refreshing male magic girl protagonists I&#039;ve ever seen. He&#039;s not quite a love interest, but more of a support character for the girls. He helps the girls whenever he can, but he&#039;s not always perfect or right like magic boy protagonists/love interests in the past (and he&#039;s actually helpful!)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 8/10<br />
I loved this show. I looked forward to watching it between my classes and didn&#039;t want to miss a single episode. I never skipped the transformations either, as they&#039;re gorgeous! <br />
<br />
Overall 8/10 <br />
I highly recommend this show if you&#039;re looking for a magic girl. The one thing I will say is the show is aimed at a younger demographic, so don&#039;t expect some huge lifechanging plot. If you liked Sailor Moon, Mermaid Melody, or Tokyo Mew Mew, I recommend this for you. If you&#039;re more of a Madoka Magica or Flip Flappers fan, then I recommend to skip this one. <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading!

    This season takes some inspiration from Yes! Precure 5 in regards to the main theme. The focus is once again in people&#039;s dreams and what they hope to achieve in the future jobwise. <br />
<br />
Visuals: <br />
1) I don&#039;t think the character design feels very precure-ly <br />
2) the animation is very inconsistent <br />
3) there&#039;s way more monster design creativity compared to a few of the previous seasons <br />
<br />
<br />
Audio: <br />
1) once again and like most seasons, the cast is a mix between legendary, experienced and rookie seiyuus. Overall I think everyone did a solid performance, where that difference in experience wasn&#039;t noticeable <br />
2) the soundtrack doesn&#039;t feel Precure-ly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414916">
        to me and I didn&#039;t like it <br />
<br />
<br />
Story and characters: <br />
1) if you&#039;re familiar with the Precure series, you know 90% of the cases, they recreate the same type of characters with minor differences. This season is yet another reflection of that with one major exception. Kirara was the only breath of fresh air in a formula that keeps repeating itself. <br />
2) each girl&#039;s transformation happens simultaneously so there&#039;s more content each episode <br />
3) most characters as I&#039;ve said felt bland and one dimensional to me and the plot didn&#039;t engage me at all, probably because there&#039;s little effort to keep things new, fresh and interesting year after year. 50 episodes is too much of this. <br />
<br />
For me it was a 5/10. <br />
