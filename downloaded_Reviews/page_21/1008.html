    Updated up to the Final Episode!<br />
<br />
Baka to Test to Shokanjuu Ni! where to start... Haha. After I saw the first season when it came out I was left wanting more. What with the unique battle system they have in the series and the amazingly hilarious cast of characters, I totally wanted another season, and here my prayers were answered with another season of Baka!<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Not really sure how to describe the story, there is a story behind it all, its just overshadowed by the fact that the anime is hilarious at every turn. Its not the main drive for the anime, the characters interactions and hilarity

          <span style="display: none;" id="review39291">
        drive the show. This season actually did have more story elements in it than the last though, and it was pretty well written, becoming quite emotional at some points as we learn about how Minami falls for Aki and how Shouko fell for Yuuji. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
I love the character designs in Baka, especially since they are able to make a wonderful mix of amazingly cute chibis to MEGA SERIOUS FACE transitions superbly. The chibis are used during discussions between the characters at some points and of course during summon battles where their summons are actually the characters themselves chibi-fied and armored. This season also threw in one last artistic win with the final two episodes changing the summons into a Halloween-esc theme, with the summons ranging from headless to vampires to brick walls!<br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
I didn&#039;t really like the Opening and Ending for this one. Compared to Season 1 and the OVA Opening and Endings this was subpar at best. They aren&#039;t catchy or memorable like the others and you can&#039;t really say, &quot;Oh my god, another musical ear worm from Baka!&quot;. Though as the season went on the OP and ED did become an earworm to be honest. I guess it was the kind of music you had to listen over and over to to become addicted, not sure if its a good or bad thing. The soundtracks in the background were also fantastic, especially in the episode about Minami&#039;s past.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
I love the characters. They have a little bit of everything in this anime! Aki is the idiot that all animes need (He might just be a little to idiotic sometimes). But when push comes to shove he always come through like a true anime idiot does! Yuuji is the total badarse of the anime, with the epic character design and attitude to go with him. Mutsurini... I love Mutsurini, he is an idol to all men everywhere, he&#039;s a ninja, photographer and somehow he&#039;s a pervert that girls don&#039;t hate. I want him to teach me his ways. Hideyoshi the trap... He never gets old, right from the get go they still won&#039;t let him be a boy, and honestly, it never gets old. Then the girls themselves are amazing as well. Minami is amazing with her tough attitude and abuse of Aki. Himeji is the shy girl that turns into an evil demon when things go wrong (evidence = end of episode one). Shoko.... She terrifies me with how she abuses Yuuji, honestly, I think she could kill us all. I love it. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Well if it isn&#039;t obvious yet I love Baka to Test to Shokanjuu Ni!. The second season is everything I wanted it to be, with its hilarity, serious moments, cross dressing, and idiocy! What more could I ask for? (Maybe some moar Mutsurini awesomeness... The show might implode if we get too much though. I thought it was going to implode, freaking assassination&#039;s he pulled this season were epic!)<br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;m sittin&#039; here waiting for more episodes because honestly, nothing will stop me from watching this amazingly hilarious anime that is Baka to Test!

Baka to test to shoukanjuu 2 was a worse scam than when I sell ice lollies made of my own frozen piss to children on my street for 5 dollars as “lemon flavour”<br />
<br />
no fuck that, it was like when I sell my patented “cancerbegone” drug to terminally ill patients for their life savings. It was that bad, I mean the first series of Baka to test to shoukanjuu was no work of art but it had its good moments, it could be funny and clever with some interesting ideas like the whole battling thing and the division of classes based on test scores, there was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review62011">
        room for some potential there.<br />
<br />
But this sequel just threw all that out the window in favour of a story-less, plot-less, one dimensional, boring Harem with nothing more than episode after episode of unoriginal rom-com stuff that we&#039;ve seen a million times  before, you know what I mean, with misunderstandings between the main character and the girls and more shots of  female characters bodies than you&#039;d find in a playboy magazine, in fact one of the best ways to describe this series would be as a fucking Hentai without the sex.<br />
<br />
<br />
When I looked closely I discovered that this series is a good example of so many romance comedy  sequels out there that I felt sick, where after the first series is successful because of its good ideas or good characters etc they for some reason abandon all that in the sequel in favour of whats called the “safe route”. <br />
<br />
The safe route basically means taking no risks by insuring the sequel will make money from DVD sales and toys by appealing to the Otaku types. Those who spend tons of money on shit like this with ridiculous amounts of fan service to appease theses dumb idiots that think that a series is good as long as it has cute girls in it. Other good examples of this is Nisemonogatari and Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu 2  both of these sequels to relatively good and okay animes were total scams where no thought at all was put into them, (see my Nisemonogatari review for more details) they are just there as manufactured scams to make money by tricking people into thinking that what they&#039;re watching is a sequel when really its just a colourful mishmash of crap.<br />
<br />
Now maybe you think im being to harsh, you say, “its not supposed to have a deep story”, or “some people just like to watch cute girls do cute things and don&#039;t want anything more from an anime.” To that I say “that&#039;s fine,” I also didn&#039;t expect a moving story from this anime or deep characters and some fan service is nice, its good to be able to shut off my brain from time to time and just watch a dumb love comedy with summoned beings in it. <br />
<br />
But this just went too far with the complete lack of any kind of story or character development and throwing all the stuff that made the first series good out the window, right next to my stock of piss flavou... I mean lemon flavoured ice lollies. If you would like one please email me at www.thisisdefiantlynotascam.co.fuckyousucker  <br />
<br />
to make matters worse they continually repeat the same jokes over and over again..  example...<br />
<br />
 guy and girl A are doing something, accidentally get in a provocative position, girl B walks in, sees this and gets angry, chaos ensues.   lather, rinse, repeat.        <br />
<br />
Guy says something, girl misunderstands, gets angry.   Lather, rinse, repeat,  <br />
<br />
“don&#039;t worry the audience wont notice if we use the same jokes again and again, just throw in a shot of some girl breasts and they&#039;ll forget all about, it doesn&#039;t matter about originality as long as the girls say something cute or we see their panties then it all good. Don&#039;t worry i`ve made tons of this shit, we can slap the story together in an afternoon, throw in some scenes of a girl blushing and we`ll make millions, who gives a fuck about art, as long as we can sell lots of crappy merchandise and I can buy myself a new boat then alls right with the world.”        <br />
<br />
Now its not all bad there were still some good elements in this series, despite the overuse of some jokes there was still some funny moments here and there and we do learn some things about the past of some of these characters, and if you like cute anime girls doing cute but pointless things then this series may appeal to you. There some okay music and some nice art here and there but nothing really to right home about.<br />
 <br />
Overall I would only recommend this series to die hard fans of the original or to people that really just want to see big breasted girls say cute things and flat chested girls do violent things, if your looking for a good romance comedy with a good story or good comedy then look else where.<br />
<br />
If you click this review was helpful I promise to send you one of my new chocolate flavoured ice lollies (chocolate not guaranteed) in the mail or my new “cancerbegone” spray tan, for people who want to look good while they die. (warning “cancerbegone” may cause cancer)

    I&#039;m going to go ahead and say it. Baka and Test is DEFINITELY my favorite anime. Tons of colorful characters, comedy, and story. <br />
<br />
Season 2 was mostly about character development rather than keeping up with the story, but that&#039;s not a bad thing. Some shows don&#039;t do character development without terrible terrible filler. Some don&#039;t at all!<br />
<br />
Story: 10 <br />
Season 2 focused more on developing the characters through individual stories than one full story throughout the season, BUT they did it right. Baka and Test Shokanjuu Ni incorporates excellent use of story arcs within it&#039;s episodes to keep the audience from that &quot;filler&quot; feeling. From crazy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review66169">
        beach days, to Minami&#039;s backstory, to peeking into girls&#039; bathing rooms, this season took it around and back.<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
Once again the animation is amazing. It retains that manga feel to it with it&#039;s &quot;pop-art&quot; look. The movement of the characters is smooth, and the detailed and whacky expressions of the characters in &quot;extreme&quot; times for them really show us what the animators can do. <br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
The voice acting in this season (I&#039;m referring to the Japanese voice acting) is greatly improved from the first. It&#039;s much more believable and adds a whole lot to the humor. As for the English Dub, it&#039;s not set to release until early 2013, but fingers crossed for it to be just as good or better than the fantastic first season. To go along with great voice acting, season 2 adds a whole new soundtrack of music to play through the series, ranging from epic battle themes to soft romantic jingles.<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
You gotta love it when writers dedicate time to letting the audience know about a show&#039;s characters, without giving you a filler feeling. In the first season you got a feel of who the characters were and a general understanding. In this season you get a full on background check on several characters, and their motives to do what they do. As always we have a wonderful variety of characters in personality and looks, always a pleasure to watch.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
YES. If I wasn&#039;t entitled to write more for the sake of potential viewers that&#039;s all I&#039;d write. Simply yes, I enjoyed it. Take time to understand the systems in the show and what&#039;s going on and who the characters are, I admit it can be random, but once you get a feel for who is who and what is what, you&#039;ll love the show to no end. (To be honest its really not that hard, but I&#039;ve known people who don&#039;t even try). There&#039;s also so many characters in this show, you&#039;re bound to relate to one of them and say &quot;Hey that&#039;s me!&quot; and put yourself in their world if only for a minute. <br />
<br />
Overall 10:<br />
WATCH IT. Watch it, enjoy it, and don&#039;t read online reviews from critics that don&#039;t enjoy a show for what it is, and instead pick it apart by flaws that don&#039;t matter in the long run. (Just look at Pokemon -__-) <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t recommend it if you don&#039;t like to laugh. (Ha)<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a nice blend of action, highschool life, just the right amount of fan-service (nothing over the top), comedy, and more all in its own unique way!<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s hoping for a 3rd season and more, just get it marketed damn it! :D<br />

    After watching episode 5 of Baka Test, I have decided that this is the funniest anime I have ever watched. Forget the subtleties, plot development, give the people what they want, and that is a good laugh. Slapstick, foreshadowing, innuendo, its all there. I can sit here and comment on all of the tiny things that make Baka great, but its pointless unless you&#039;ve seen it yourself. This is my third time watching the entire series, and I have cracked up laughing during every single episode. The only problem with the anime is that there aren&#039;t more. Why won&#039;t you give us more?????!!!! Overall great

          <span style="display: none;" id="review40993">
        anime. The plot line is very random and if youve seen season 1, nothing really changes. Akira and Minami are still going at it, but its still hilarious. <br />
<br />
That&#039;s about it, go watch it now. Best continuous anime out.

    I almost forgot to do a review for this anime. Well, here&#039;s my review for this anime.<br />
<br />
Baka and Test: Summon the Beast 2, or Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni!, is one of the greatest anime I&#039;ve ever watched. If you guys watched School Rumble, Angel Beats, or Lucky Star, then you would most likely enjoy school comedies. Baka and Test basically exceeds those three previously mentioned. It reaches to new heights with it&#039;s amazingness. There is so much to talk about with this anime.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s begin with the story. The story is easy to keep up. It also had some funny moments, which I shall

          <span style="display: none;" id="review129629">
        not mention. It kept me laughing. There was no dull moment in this anime. You could be in the worst mood possible, and watching one episode of this anime will get you excited.<br />
<br />
The characters are so respectable. It is hard to find one that you cannot respect, and even if you do find one that you can&#039;t really respect, it&#039;ll be one small issue at best. I never found a characte that I can&#039;t respect; they&#039;re all enjoyable in their own way. The anime&#039;s uniqueness comes from the characters, but not just them.<br />
<br />
The music is catchy. Once I heard them, I just kept listening to them. I don&#039;t really care that they&#039;re in Japanese. It&#039;s just so uplifting.<br />
<br />
The art&#039;s well done. The characters all look nice. The scenery is also nice. I don&#039;t think that they had the background characters with bo eyes and the back-background characters as dotted cardboard cutouts, as composed to season one when they did. It&#039;s not that that is an issue, but it&#039;s still an art design, right?<br />
<br />
Enjoyment… if I had to sum it up in one go, it&#039;ll go like this:<br />
&quot;This is the greatest anime I&#039;ve ever watched; the characters are funny and a bit goofy in a good way, the jokes never get old, and you could keep watching this anime over and over again.&quot;<br />
That&#039;s the simple way, but you get the picture.<br />
<br />
All and all, the anime is a must watch. I give this anime a 10/10. Like I said, it is funny as all hell. If you haven&#039;t seen this anime yet or haven&#039;t wayched it in a while, stop reading this and go watch it! I highly recommend this to you all. Why? Well, the biggest reason isn&#039;t mentioned above. It&#039;s really how there is something for EVERYONE to enjoy.

    Ok, so this is a sequel from season one and so far it as funny as the first season but not as funny as it is, co&#039;z this season is more on how things started, so how do I rate it?<br />
<br />
Story-fair 6.<br />
<br />
Ok, I&#039;ve watched its 1st season, including the 2 episode OVA, the plot is no longer the same, co&#039;z this season is more on how things started (I may have mentioned that), well, part of it, because unlike the previous season were a group of losers who vie for the Class A&#039;s fully furbish room, this is more of slapstick, funny flashbacks and prequel

          <span style="display: none;" id="review42647">
        tidbits.<br />
<br />
Art- mediocre 5.<br />
<br />
I guess it simply the same as any art from any anime where the character drawn sports a big head in a slender body. <br />
<br />
Sound- fair 6.<br />
<br />
Well, though I hate the opening theme for this season 2, kinda like its ending theme.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character: Good 7.<br />
<br />
Well, they&#039;re still there as funny as usual, like the following:<br />
<br />
Himeji Mizuki- a good student with both beauty and brains stuck or chooses to be in a place (Class F) were it is rule by students with a bad case of dyslexia , who has feelings for Akihisa, but somehow is affected but Minami&#039;s kissing the latter.<br />
 <br />
Kinoshita Hideyoshi - a bishonen who up to now is still mistaken for a girl, or was he just a gay magnet were even a straight guy would fall for him?<br />
<br />
Kirishima Shouko - a Class A valedictorian who&#039;s extremely obsess with Yuuji.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sakamoto Yuuji- the thing about him, is that his character has been undermine for this season, sure his character of being radical ,a good strategist and being  cool is still there, he falls short when he&#039;s unable to get out of extreme situations and as it turns out he&#039;s not much of a chick magnet after all.<br />
<br />
Shimada Minami - I can&#039;t say if her character is also been undermine, but in this season 2 where it all begun conflicts as to how her relationship with Akishia, info states that Akihisa considers Minami as one of the &quot;Top Ten Women not to date&quot; in Fumizuki academy and yet in this season Akishia has shown some caring towards her to be his friend.<br />
<br />
Tsuchiya Kouta - the class perv and is still called &quot;Muttsurini.&quot; Only this time he seems to have a thing for Koudou Aiko and she (Aiko) also has a thing for him.<br />
<br />
Yoshii Akihisa - the fool of fools, actually he&#039;s not really a loser at all, it&#039;s just that he&#039;s what you can call as dyslexic, it is  a learning disorder which a person may not do well in an academic setting but, sees learning in a different light, as usual what he lacks in academic grades he makes up for being street smart.<br />
<br />
and the rest are still doing what their roles call for.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- good 7.<br />
<br />
Even, if this anime has fallen short it still provides the kind of enjoyment as its first season, but the climax is not there anymore.<br />
<br />
Overall - good 7. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ll leave this blank. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    And so ends another season of the show with one of the most cumbersome names imaginable. Yes I&#039;m not really sure a title would fly over here in the western hemisphere... what if shows like Lost were called &quot;Islands and Passengers and Smoke Monsters&quot;... but I digress. Yes Baka to Test to Shokanjuu (missing out on an excellent opportunity to call itself Baka 2 Test 2 Shokanjuu... provided it used the english pronunciation of the number 2... blah) has finally ended and its left... a strange taste in my mouth. Its definitely not what I expected from a Baka to season, so lets elaborate shall

          <span style="display: none;" id="review44725">
        we. <br />
<br />
Let me start for once with the OP of this season (how appropriate?). I normally don&#039;t care much about the opening of a series but this time was an exception. Baka to season 1... and even the ova, had 2 really fun openings. They were fast, they were fluid, they showed off a lot of what to expect from the characters without giving away the plot (well... what little plot there was). I even caught myself laughing at some of the imagery in OVAs opening, and that was a first as far as openings go. The second seasons opening just feels like a drag. The music is much the same as its predecessors, but the images are just so dull. Still shots, and random images of items that are somewhat connected to the show (like a nail bat, or that fox doll thing that minami has). It was just a bit of a bore, after how fun the first 2 openings felt is all... but again its just an opening so the show can&#039;t really lose any marks for it. <br />
<br />
Anyways, on to the actual meat of the series. Baka to test to Shokanjuu... was never really a series that strong in plot. It was a fairly mindless rom-com... but it certainly had a lot more going for it than this season did. It had an overall goal to say the least... The down trodden F class is sick of being considered the scum of the earth, and needs to work its way up the intellectual ladder to show that they aren&#039;t any less human than anyone else, by beating the top of the school class A. It was simple but effective, and even helped learn us a lesson: Just because your grades are bad, doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t achieve greatness. <br />
<br />
But season 2 is... well... really just a bunch of filler stringed together. I kid you not, the first not 1, but 2 episodes open with a &quot;beach&quot; episode (you know... that episode thats in almost every rom-com, where they go to the beach really just as an excuse to show off the main female in a bikini). It actually takes until episode 4 before you even see the little summons, and thats really in a filler episode as well. In fact, they avoid having tests and summoned beings in the show so much, that I kind of wonder why they didn&#039;t just call the season &quot;Idiots&quot;. Anyways, while Idiots doesn&#039;t really have any one big plot to string the series together like the first season did, it does have a variety of sub plots that span over 1 - 3 episodes, so its not totally without merit. <br />
<br />
The thing that really bugs me about this second season is that it really seems to be trying to alienating a good portion of its fan base. Since a sequel will primarily be aiming at current fans of the show, it should aim to build up what it already established and improve the formula that apparently worked out the first time. Instead, Idiots seems to take the show in a different direction. The first season was a light hearted comedy, with a touch of romance and a little bit of tactical warfare. Season 2 on the the other hand... is really looking to be more of a romance with some comedy filler put in here or there. <br />
<br />
Now there&#039;s nothing wrong with that formula either, in fact the first season had some rather touching and more serious moments to it as well. However... it never did this at the expense of comedy. This is again, because the first season WAS a comedy, it made sure every episode was a laugh, and added those little touching scenes as a drizzle of caramel on top of the already delicious chocolate fudge sundae. Idiots however, decides to put romance on equal grounds to comedy. There are a couple episodes that are almost devoid of comedy actually, and look more like something I would see in Ef - a tale of memories rather than a show that has &quot;Idiots&quot; in the freaking title. <br />
<br />
In any case, none of the above grievances really makes Idiots a bad show. I would prefer a more linear story like the first season but its not totally necessary. The characters are more of the same, if you liked &#039;em in the first season, you&#039;ll still like &#039;em here. The show does suffer a tiny bit from the usual trap that sequels fall into... that is over abusing certain popular aspects or quirks of characters to the extreme (like always making Akihisa cross dress... it was funny in the OVA but if you keep making it a running gag it loses the charm) but its not enough to really do any harm. The art is still really really nice to look at, although with today&#039;s sophisticated technology that doesn&#039;t really say a lot since looking nice is easier than ever. The comedy... while a lot more sparse than the first season, is still relatively funny. My only problem was that it was a more generic rom-com style comedy, where as I feel the first season had a bit of a more unique sense that made it stand out as an anime. <br />
<br />
Really, to sum up, Idiots just shouldn&#039;t bear the Idiots and Tests and Summoned Beings name. On its own its a pretty solid anime, the comedy again holds up fairly well, and I was even fairly touched by some of the character back stories. It&#039;s just that it&#039;s too different from the original... and I felt a little betrayed is all. If it had been its own series I probably would have felt a lot kinder to it. I feel like a child whos been hoping and asking for a new set of roller blades all year long... but when christmas comes round I get a pogo stick. Sure its fun at times and I found a few new things to do I didn&#039;t know about before... but its just not what I hoped for. Oh well, its fun enough for now... maybe next christmas.

    This is only my second review so please leave  some feed back and rate the review if you read it!<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
<br />
For the most part the show is what you would expect from Baka and Test, light hearted silly and fun to watch with loads of comedic tid bits that will have &quot;ROFLing&quot; your ass off, but with more to it this time around.<br />
<br />
The series starts where it left off, a weak (Story wise) love triangle between Akihisa, Minami, and Himeji that is and really isn&#039;t the main focus of the show. However this season changes that a bit in the second half and gives

          <span style="display: none;" id="review84487">
        us the much needed character development that was virtually (More literally) nonexistent in the first season. During these episodes we learn a lot more about the characters pasts which makes the triangle more interesting and is definitely paving the way for a third season.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately there are some problems with it as well. The main one being the arc centered around peeping on the girls. It lasted way too long and should have been at least an episode shorter. It simply didn&#039;t bring much value to the show as a whole, and to me felt like a filler arc.<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
<br />
This is my favorite part of the show, everything from all the various character designs to the sometimes simple, but unique backdrops. The entire style of this show is just fun to look at and really fits the mood of the show. I&#039;m particularly fond of the way they treat the shading by putting little circles inside everything in the backgrounds. Animation is solid and consistent throughout the entire show and never fails to just look good and fluid. Simply put I think this show looks awesome and have yet to adore any other show as much as this.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
<br />
I&#039;m a dub fag so please forgive me dub haters but it is what it is. <br />
<br />
The dub for Baka has always been good to me, and it definitely has one of the better dubs that much is for sure. The cast sounds pretty decent without any (Maybe one or two) annoying sounding characters, and all the voices fit the characters pretty well. The music in the show however is really nothing special; in fact I can&#039;t even recall any BGM that I can even replay in my head which is a little disappointing because I felt the music for the show could have been great given the art style.<br />
<br />
The opening and ending are nothing that special either but that&#039;s really just personal preference more than anything. I will say that the ending is fun to watch though and grew a little on me after I had watched it a few times.<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
<br />
The cast itself is not very large compared to some shows and is relatively easy to follow, relate to, and recognize at a moments notice. Each is designed very well and look great. The only problem is other than the main characters not much is discovered or explored in the way of back story or development. Many of the characters just always act the same as they have and don&#039;t really change. Which given the show is mostly a comedy is not necessarily a bad thing either. Each brings their own amount of oomph to certain jokes in the series, but I felt they could have explored the others, at least some; a little bit.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
<br />
It&#039;s hard to not enjoy this show there is plenty of comedy (Most of which is slightly clever, but not as much as the first season.) to keep you laughing and character development is never a bad thing as far as I am concerned. Everything looks great and sounds good so there&#039;s nothing distracting and it&#039;s just an overall good experience.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
<br />
Baka and Test is just an all around good show with a lil’ of something for almost everybody. It looks great and has a wide variety of comedic elements that can really make you laugh and it&#039;s at times hard to stop watching. Even when it gets serious about its characters they find a way to keep it light hearted and yet still emotional while being fun to watch. I think if you sat down and watched it with a close friend you would have an unforgettable time laughing it up just as I did with season one. This is one of those must try series that almost everyone can enjoy and it’s not very long so you have nothing to lose giving it a try.<br />

    A lot of times, the second season is not really as good as the first one but not here. Everything is just the same fun as the first season and it doesn’t really get old at all. Some jokes are played off but they put it a little different so it feels new. Some of it actually becomes even funnier because of Yoshii’s sister playing more of a role in it.<br />
<br />
Again, the show follows the characters and actually doesn’t really have much of the avatar battles that I would have liked to see more of. I feel that they sort of skipped out a bit

          <span style="display: none;" id="review160441">
        on the battles again. If the name has summon the beasts in it, wouldn’t you think that they would have more of the beasts in it instead of a romantic comedy?<br />
<br />
The episodes do have a lot more about romance and what the characters are feeling to one another to a point you think it would end up having an explosive ending that would shock you. I can’t tell you if it does because of spoilers but it’s what I felt around the 5th episode. Other then that, pretty much the same as the first season with every once in a while having battles. I guess the one thing that seems different is that there is a lack of main story that the first had with them trying to help Mizuki by getting better items. This one has more of a by episode comedy skit sort of style to the story that can get from really strange to just a average day in the park.<br />
<br />
There is one character that does make a bit more of an appearance in this sequel then in the first, Aiko Kudou. Surprisingly I like her being brought in and being sort of the rival of Kouta in a sense. She teases him so much that I have a small feeling that she likes him a bit more then she lets on to prove even a pervert can be loveable if stupid enough. Ok… so I’m making a small exaggeration but it gives us another romance train to look at. Before this, the only romance trains we had going was Yoshii’s triangle with Mizuki and Minami and then Yuuji’s problems with Shouko. To have a bit of different love train going on does keep the show refreshing.<br />
<br />
Now if only we could get an actual girl for Hideyoshi… of course I know that probably will never happen because the writers are having way to much fun with the idea that Hideyoshi being mistaken for a girl all the time. If this was real life I would feel very sorry for him but as its not, the yoai lover in me screams for that idea.<br />
<br />
Now do you have to watch the OVA before the second series? No but you will miss so many things if you don’t they do occasionally talk about what happened during them.<br />
<br />
The Animation is the same as before though they do a lot more pastel scenes then before. It doesn’t bother me much since the comedy kept me laughing. I am also not really happy about how Hideyoshi keeps talking in a Shakespearian tone. I liked the way he spoke in the English version instead. The ‘thou’ and ‘aren’t’ just bother me and make me feel like I’m reading Romeo and Juliet, not watching a Japanese comedy.<br />
<br />
The music is just as good as the first again, a rather good beat although I don’t know if I would put it on a ipod. It can get a little annoying to listen to it over and over again. The ending song isn’t really that special, pretty much blends together with all the other pop songs that are used in anime. This isn’t dubbed so the voices kind of made me cringe a little. Some of the girls voices just felt a little two high pitched.

    Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni! follows up the first season with pretty much more of the same. If you liked the first installment, you&#039;ll probably like the second too. Nothing really changes, but they do add some more serious episodes. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s no real story in the show. The premise is that students from 6 classes (A to F) can have battles with each other using summoned monsters. The skill of the monsters are based on that student&#039;s score in whatever subject the current judging instructor teaches. <br />
<br />
The characters are the same from the first season, as are the gimmicks and jokes around them. However,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review44861">
        as mentioned earlier there are types of &quot;origin&quot; episodes for a few cast members which sheds more light on their personalities. These seem a little out of place with the comedy in the series, but helps to add depth. Each of them are especially thoughtful and touching. Something you would expect to see from a show like Clannad. <br />
<br />
However, if you&#039;re looking for progression with things like the Aki love triangle (err Pentagon?) or the Yuuji/Shouko relationship you&#039;ll probably be disappointed. Except for using the situations to make uncomfortable and hilarious moments, it gives little in the way of seeing an end to show. (Which is good and bad.)<br />
<br />
If you&#039;ve seen the first season then you&#039;ll be able to spot most of the jokes coming from a mile away. Ni does not really break any ground in originality. However, the execution for the humor is great. The show manages to tell the same joke 100 times, but they do it in 100 different ways. Don&#039;t worry everything is back from nose bleeds, cross dressing, and the class F single army. <br />
<br />
Overall Baka To Test Shoukanjuu Ni! is an excellent follow up to the first season. Despite the shortcomings, it manages to be a hilarious, yet thoughtful show that makes the grade. <br />

    First review - starting off with an awesome anime...<br />
<br />
After finishing the first season of Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu, my natural instincts made me search for and hoped there was a second season because it was that hilarious and entertaining it made me want to watch the sequel, if there wasn&#039;t a sequel then I would have watched the the first season over again. Of course Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni! didn&#039;t fail at delivering those funny knacks and beautiful animation the first season portrayed.<br />
<br />
Story:9/10<br />
Although there isn&#039;t a major storyline in the series it still kept me on my toes. Few bits of pieces

          <span style="display: none;" id="review74425">
        may have needed some more thought into it but overall I loved it. Even without a storyline it was extremely funny and an anime for anyone to watch. <br />
<br />
Art:10/10<br />
The art of the anime was still amazing, maybe even better than the prequel. It maintained that modern art mixed with pop-art, and the chibi forms of the characters were superb (and cute if I may add :p). The animation of the movements and action scenes were detailed and crisp.. *applause*<br />
<br />
Sound:10/10<br />
As always, the voice actors for each character in Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni! played their roles perfectly. I was happy to see they kept the same voice actors from the first season because I couldn&#039;t, or should I say wouldn&#039;t, picture them with different voices at all. <br />
<br />
Character:10/10<br />
In this anime we see more character development which is wonderful seeing how each character in the anime is unique through numerous displays action and humor. I know for sure that I instantly loved each character in the anime and I know you will too :)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:10/10<br />
Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni! has gotta be one of the funniest and most entertaining series I have watched. Not once did I think about dropping or changing to a different anime. It&#039;s also easy to relate with and maybe you might even find a character that you can see yourself as.<br />
<br />
Overall:10/10<br />
For anyone who is looking for laughter and a hint of romance and action then this is the anime you need to watch...screw it, I recommend this to anyone and everyone (but if you really hate comedy, then too bad.. watch it :p)<br />
<br />
This is one of my favourite series and I would watch it over again if i ever get bored or if it&#039;s just a Friday night.<br />

    A perfect 10 ^_^<br />
<br />
I watched the first Baka to Test and when I heard they were making a season 2, I got excited instantly! And it was worth the wait. Right from the get-go it was great. Watching the first episode of the second season reminded me why I feel in love with this anime so much. I laughed so hard watching the first episode. This anime is not to be take literally in any way. Its a goofy, silly, with some what romance thrown in to it and it works perfectly. Heck if it ain&#039;t broken don&#039;t fix it right. <br />
<br />
The first couple of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review84383">
        episodes, I want to say 6 or so episodes, don&#039;t take place in the high school. The first 3 episodes take place on a beach trip and the other 3-4 episodes take place in a training school. Then its back to its roots. <br />
<br />
But the main reason to watch Baka to Test is for the characters. How each one of them interacts with one another is whats the anime a must watch. The episodes are filled with jokes that will make you laugh and even some call back referencing things that happen in the ova&#039;s or in the first season, which makes some jokes even better. I love the relation ship between Shouko and Yuji, they might even be the best couple ever... even if Yujj doesn&#039;t want to be with her.^_^  But to be truly honest I love the narration more then anything, well that is for the English dub, with his wise crack remarks and and comments make watching even better. Hes the bow on the present so to speak makes it just a tad better. All the original charters are still here, the truly lovable Hideyoshi with his devilish female body, and Akihisa the dumbest main character ever who has two beautiful female after him, the athletic and yet charming, Minami, and who could forget the pink haired, bombshell, Mizuki which Akihisa doesn&#039;t get that they love him.This time around there is more of a love story toward the end that will make you rip out you hair leaving you with no answer on who he want to be with but I hope he gets with Mizuki, shes just so cute ^_^ as of now there is no word of season 3 but I&#039;m crossing my fingers on this one, this story is nowhere close to done<br />
<br />
The art style from the first season is still the same. Which isn&#039;t a bad thing. The back round has a feel good feel to it where  shadows are so post to lie it colored in by green, red, blue, etc with poke-a-dot pattern. When large crowds are on scene only a few of them are drawn and the rest are outlined and filled in with this pattern. Which is new idea and an easy way to cut corners and ends up being very created and you end up loving this shadow pattern.Same as in the original Baka to Test the intro song is amazing along with the video, not as good as the original, but still good. The ending song and video are well done and is worth watching every time.  <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t think I can explain how enjoyable this is to watch. Its nonstop fun from the beginning to the end after the credits are done and even then the last key after that the &quot;Next time on...&quot; is really funny to hear with the narrator asking a character a question and them getting it wrong. and hearing &quot;This is will be on the test&quot; has already became iconic to me like Funimation &quot;You should be watching&quot;. Its a must watch to all anime lovers out there. It might look like a average high school Anime but I can tell you, you have been fooled this is a one of a kind anime that you wont get the same satisfaction in other high school anime. THIS IS NOT LIKE OTHER ANIME&#039;S!!!  <br />

    I feel that most of the reviews are misleading. The overwhelming majority hail this show as hilarious and interesting, but I certainly didn&#039;t get any of that from watching it.<br />
<br />
I binged all of this series (season 1, Matsuri, season 2, and the specials) and I can say that it was only enjoyable for the first few episodes. The gags quickly became overused and just annoying rather quickly. All jokes in this series center around the following:<br />
<br />
- Akihisa getting attacked by two girls out of jealousy<br />
- Hideyoshi being a tomgirl or an ambiguous gender<br />
- Yuuji getting stabbed in the eyes by Shouko due to jealousy<br />
- Ninja

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311147">
        Pervert spraying blood from his nose<br />
- Minami being called flat-chested and getting violent<br />
<br />
That pretty much sums up the entire series. These same gags are repeated ad nauseam to the point that it was painful to watch. This season&#039;s only saving grace was finally doing some character development/backstory.<br />
<br />
Season 1 had an semi-interesting story invloving the summons, but it quickly devolved to the overused gags. The Matsuri mini-series was practically nothing but the same jokes, but adding in crossdressing for the other male characters (instead of just Hideyoshi), and having a story that was mostly uninpressive and pointless. And that brings us to season 2.<br />
<br />
The breakdown:<br />
<br />
Story - 6<br />
<br />
Saved from a lower score by the character development in this season.<br />
<br />
Art - 6<br />
<br />
Characters are neat and colorful. Nothing spectacular, but nothing awful--except the extremely overdone breast physics for Mizuki. Good lord, why do her breasts shake violently in different directions when she slowly turns 90 degrees?<br />
<br />
Sound - 5<br />
<br />
Music was fitting but was largely forgettable. Again, nothing great, nothing terrible.<br />
<br />
Character - 4<br />
<br />
Being kind, the characters are decent at best. These characters are built on common tropes with just their gags and little else to support them. Only a handful received attention in the story and had any amount of development.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 3<br />
<br />
At the start of the series (season 1) there was laughter and enjoyment. By the end of season 1, I was lucky to get a chuckle per episode. This was the level of enjoyment that maintained until the middle of season 2. Again, the only reason this score is not lower is due to the fairly enjoyable character development arc.<br />
<br />
Overall - 5<br />
<br />
TL;DR<br />
<br />
This show is rated much higher than it deserves--the whole series is. It suffers from overusing gags and jokes that were only mildly funny the first time we saw them.<br />
<br />
If you enjoy stupid and repetitive comedy, you may like this better than I did, but overall, this show is mediocre at best.

    I am really starting to love Baka &amp; Test more and more as each day goes by. The art was perfect and the music was great including the ending song which I listened to a lot of times. <br />
<br />
The cast really spend time with each other, getting to know one another and share the bonds together. Even including the Yukata contest where the guys make funny poses and WOW! I cannot stop laughing. Even especially, like love interests sometimes they might fall apart due to one mistake. Yuuji and Shoko started to love each other when they were kids and I was so sad to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review101589">
        see that Yuuji protected Shoko from the bullies but he ends up getting beaten. <br />
<br />
I loved the part on episode 4 where Himeji asks the guys to taste her food and they freaked out. Even also the part on where the summoning portal. When the person says &quot;Summon&quot;, the little guy speaks on his/her true intentions.<br />
<br />
The haunted place in the final episode is the epic moment where Akihisa &amp; Yuuji defeated the 3A class. This also shows that even though they have poor grades, that doesn&#039;t mean they are complete washouts. They can excel in some things way better than those who have good grades.<br />
<br />
My favorite character still remins as Hideyoshi Kinoshita. As stated in my previous review on Baka &amp; Test: Matsuri<br />
<br />
I do believe that this is also a good lesson to learn that even though your grades may be low, you are still a brighter genius. Grades don&#039;t distinguish a person&#039;s character which is a statement which I will never forget.<br />
<br />
I will give it a perfect score of 10/10.

    What a fantastic surprise. I left this anime on hold for over two years, only to find out how fantastic it is. During the COVID-19 pandemic I was looking for something joyful and I only found those tedious harems where the hero is extremely kind and full of virtues while the heroines are weak and always in need of help, in Baka to Test, forget all that!<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
The story is completely unreal, which already makes the purpose of the work clear, making you laugh with the most stereotyped events possible while playing with jargon from other works like Saint Seiya, Yu-gi-oh, among others. The school&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337793">
        students are divided into hierarchical grades based on grades that fight each other for privileges. It looks horrible, but it&#039;s fantastic (and it&#039;s not because of the synopsis, it&#039;s how it was done). Yes it is! It has romantic comedy because after all it is a harem. And no, it is not a harem where the protagonist will look like an idiot alienated from the heroines&#039; feelings until the end of the work, so indulge yourself in this work!<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
Watch in HD please. The effects, the details, the filters, are all exaggerated and perfectly complete the work. The way in which the art director expresses battles is simply fantastic, whether showing it as a board game or as a turn-based RPG. It&#039;s hilarious.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
I really liked the sound of the second season, it increased slightly in the first.<br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
Thats a point!With a generic synopsis story with a niche (harem) so full of not so good works, why would this be any different? The answer is this question, characters. Each is extremely stereotyped, but escapes in a comical way by showing that he is lampooning stereotypes of the harem genre. A strong heroine (Minami), a princess (Himeji) and other very strong stereotypes are presented, but perfectly presented, making the work satisfactory.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
2 seasons in 3 days, that answers this question.<br />
<br />
I usually write review only when the work is bad, to warn people and not to make them waste the time I wasted. Yes, taste is individual, but I think it&#039;s fair to say what not to expect from a work that sometimes deceives us. But this is the first anime that obligatorily made me come here and write that although everything seems absurdly obvious, a generic synopsis and very stereotyped characters, this work is fantastic.<br />
<br />
Forgive my flawed English, it is not my mother lang. Hug o7

    just to let you know, i tried to watched the 1st ep of the second season in english dub, but since i was so used to the jap dub, the eng dub sounded so bad, i only watched like the first 3min of eng dub then switched to sub.<br />
<br />
Baka to test season 2 was a great anime. but you may be thinking, why did i rate it a 7? not higher. well, the beginning was bad. first like 3 eps were so bad but  the rest were okay. i really enjoyed the last 5 or so episodes. <br />
<br />
story: 6/10<br />
<br />
what do u expect from this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review210636">
        honestly? it&#039;s a comedy anime. don&#039;t get me wrong here, i really do like comedy anime. i just dont want to ratings to be biased (i want to rate everything equally, so if the story is bad, then so be it) so this is why i rating the story low. there is plot here and there but it gets blocked out by the comedy.<br />
<br />
art: 8/10<br />
<br />
nothing really wrong here.... well the nosebleeds were a bit overused (i do know what the nosebleeds represent) but still. There&#039;s nothing else really to talk about artwise.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
<br />
Well, how can sound be bad? Honestly, unless the voice acting is bad (*cough* eng dubs *cough*) then it&#039;s not 10/10. i really liked the OP. I probably didn&#039;t like the english dubs due to the fact i watched it in subs first.<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
<br />
Some of the characters were too baka, it felt that in the fillers, they were just rushed in to do really silly things. but either than that, nothing else.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
<br />
i had a blast watching this anime. I had a few laughs here and there and i really liked how it ended (many will disagree).<br />
<br />
Overall: 7/10

    My first review, let´s go!<br />
<br />
Ah, Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni!<br />
More of the same? Or something completely different?<br />
Some might say that it&#039;s one or the other, I myself say that it&#039;s both at the same time.<br />
This will be a retrospective on the second season of Baka to Test, and will contain little to no spoilers, so let&#039;s dive right into it.<br />
<br />
Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni! is just like it&#039;s first season a true comedy. And it very much stays in the roots of the genre. The amount of jokes thrown at the viewer is very high, and just like the first season of high

          <span style="display: none;" id="review63823">
        quality. All the jokes used in the series get refferenced or come back multiple times, and that was made the first season very great. As where a lot of people would agree that the jokes are being reused like the knife and fork you use each and every meal, I actually think this is a good thing. Because it works. Truelly this is a matter of oppinion, but I quite like the jokes.<br />
During the first two episodes you can emidiately notice that the creators tried to get even new viewers up to date with the characters and with the jokes from the first season so that anyone can jump in and enjoy the fun. Because essentially that&#039;s all this anime is. Fun. Or atleast that&#039;s what it was in season one.<br />
What I really did not expect from the anime is the amount of background story they add to a lot of the characters. I will not say which characters get their own &quot;arcs&quot; but I will say that it greatly improves some of the characters, whereas you wouldn&#039;t normally understand why they act in a certain way or why they feel like they do. And this give the anime a lot more depth then it had in season one, which to everyone who watched the first season is quite shocking. And I personally like that. Speaking of character developement.<br />
All the characters from the first season are back, and none get added, this means that the anime spends most of it&#039;s time building on the already existing characters and this makes for quite a good amount of character developement. Not only on a personal level, but also on a more social level. A lot of characters have had their role thrown all over the place, whereas Yoshi&#039;s sister used to have a pretty decently sized role, she now only has about 20 lines of dialogue. And characters like Hideyoshi and Voyeur have been greatly build opon and improved. Again, I like this. Especially Voyeur, who went from being a supportive character to being an actual main character, and man he has been improved. And so has Hideyoshi.<br />
As you may have noticed, I have paid little to no attention to the female characters yet (apart from Hideyoshi) and this is for a very good reason.<br />
Believe it or not, but the girls get a lot better of a role in season two. In season one they were kind of there and did not really accomplish much, this has totally made a 180° turn. They become much more relevant to the plot and the actual overal experience, which in my oppinion should&#039;ve been done in season two.<br />
Another welcome addition to the series is how not everything takes place inside of the school anymore and I like how the plot has been greatly improved. What am I saying, I like how there IS plot now. And that makes it already a lot more interesting to watch.<br />
The art and animation has also had an incredible boost in quality. This is very noticable and just like the first season fits the show perfectly. You can truely see how much it has improved in the character specific episodes how much effort they put into them, just from the visuals.<br />
<br />
You might ask yourself this: &quot;Is it truely without flaws?&quot; And, well... no. Offcourse not. No show is without flaws. However, all the flaws that there were in season one have been pollished and refined. The episodes aren&#039;t as repetitive anymore, the story is actually there and most importantly, the characters actually have something about themselves to say, a story to tell, sometimes even quite literally.<br />
The only actual flaw that I DID have with the anime is how it sometimes feels that the show is flying all over the place, especially in dialogue. There&#039;s not much transition between events and some stuff it just flat out skimmed over. But I guess this can be forgiven because at heart, this anime is and stays a comedy for viewing pleasure only.<br />
<br />
Some people might say they were disapointed with the second season, and I can see why you would think that, if you like change. But honestly, the formula worked great, so there is no need for any change.<br />
<br />
And with those words I leave you with my thoughts on Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni!<br />
Which is in my oppinion worth watching.<br />
<br />

    To save myself some time, I&#039;ll write this review considering both seasons and the OVA.<br />
<br />
Let me say this beforehand: some details were changed from the light novel, some of which are major details. (What those are is up to you to find out.) And the anime did not cover all of the light novel. Nevertheless, Baka to Test is still one of the best anime out there, and is a classic must-watch. The review will be based solely on the anime.<br />
<br />
Story - 10<br />
Baka to Test has a very interesting premise: a school where you &quot;fight&quot; for your classroom status based on your score tests. That

          <span style="display: none;" id="review193716">
        in itself was enough for me to grab this anime to my watch list. The story has a nice plot twists on it. Very humorous. The side stories does not bore you, and develops the characters thoroughly.<br />
<br />
I have no negative thoughts to say.<br />
<br />
Art - 7<br />
Wasn&#039;t good nor bad. Just average, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Sound - 8<br />
Awesome VA. Good OP and ED. My fave: Getsuyuo wa Kirai (OVA ED)<br />
<br />
Character - 10<br />
Nice lineup of characters. Each one of the usual cast is more or less developed, and suits the series well. Each one has uniqueness. They were able to enhance the beauty of the already good premise, which led to a well-told story.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 10<br />
I can&#039;t help but enjoy this. High rewatch value.<br />
<br />
Overall - 9<br />
I&#039;d say: YOU ARE MISSING OUT A LOT IF YOU HAVEN&#039;T WATCHED BAKA TO TEST!<br />
<br />
Why not 10? Unfinished.

    Just like first season. <br />
<br />
Simply and boring, i think there was a good joke somewhere however i may be wrong. Those jokes are so simply that only kids that have not seen many animes would like this.<br />
<br />
So basically this season maybe a bit better but still very generic to a point where you dont realy care. So there is no story, drawing and story is just okey, characters are boring stereotypes.<br />
<br />
Well if you like simply animes then you gona like it then you gona enjoy this but be warned, Dragon Balls is very complicated compared to this anime.

    2nd Season of Baka and Test - Summon The Beasts<br />
2011 Anime produced by Silver Link and Licensed by Funimation<br />
Review from my POV (w/personal biases)<br />
Viewed in the English DUB (2013)<br />
DO NOT WATCH if you haven&#039;t seen S1.<br />
(Sp)oiler-ish<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
+ The humor is stronger and with more variety than the previous season. It doesnt get as stale.<br />
+ The Art design was very appealing (SO MANY COLORS!!!)<br />
+ I didn&#039;t have any problem with any of the performances (except one). Even the supporting cast was great. Trina Nishimura and Todd Haberkorn both have small but enjoyable parts. Plus I like how Brina Palencia practically has half an episode to herself :P<br />
+

          <span style="display: none;" id="review88847">
        Haunted House arc.<br />
(Personal) + I really dug the amplified romantic element :3<br />
(Sp)+ That one joke with Minami summoning during the Haunted House arc almost killed me<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
- There&#039;s almost little to no cohesive plot in this season. Ultimately, it just feels like a filler season.<br />
- The sequencing and format of episodes. Some episodes were split in two, some episodes have arcs(The peeking one dragged a bit for me personally), episodes of Exposition were introduced, and the everything about it all felt scrambled.<br />
- The Backstory episodes completely felt out of place. (Sp) Not a fan of the German accent.<br />
- Moments of serious tone can take you out of it sometimes.<br />
- Sadly, Summoner Test Wars are used as a gimmick......... once again<br />
(personal) - Akihisa Yoshi, GAWD YOU ARE SO DENSE!!! Making male otaku rage!<br />
<br />
Final Note: Don&#039;t consider this season of Baka and Test as one that would focus on plot, but one that focuses on amplifying it&#039;s already present humor. In that sense, it succeeds in vibrant colors.<br />
<br />
Recommends: To those who really enjoyed the humor of the first Season.
