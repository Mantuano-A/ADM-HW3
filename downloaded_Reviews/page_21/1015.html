From here on, the story is filled with plot twists, one (sometimes 2-) dimensional political strategy and good fun that makes you want to watch the next episode....this is especially true around episode 20 when things really start getting complicated. Every episode is adds a new dimension and piece to the storyline, exploring different

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22132">
        types of love and the varying criteria of functional companionship for different types of relationships. <br />
<br />
Art (7 out of 10):<br />
<br />
The art itself isn&#039;t too bad but sometimes the movement of characters is a little stiff. For the most part, the color scheme, contrasts, and proportions are good. I like the style and delicacy of the lines, the eye animation is especially good in exhibiting more &quot;serious&quot; emotions such as &quot;determination&quot; or &quot;pain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sound (7 out of 10): <br />
<br />
The ending theme and opening theme (so far) has been the same for the whole series. I ike the opening theme and it does a nice job of setting up the tone of the show. However, I think the ending theme song is gorgeous. <br />
<br />
Character (9 out of 10):<br />
<br />
The characters are wonderful. Kajika is a little ridiculous....she isn&#039;t stupid just pretty reckless and willful (but you don&#039;t really see these qualities until later in the story where it is tested). She is really weird but that&#039;s what I liked about her. You really get swept into &quot;her&quot; way of thinking even if it may be a little naive at times. The guys are wonderful...I think the author pretty much just listed the sexy archetypes of male anime characters than made a character for each characterization. Then, beyond that, developed back stories that would explain why there were the way there and what characteristics would be necessary in an emotional partner for each. That may sound boring but it is actually really well done and entertaining in the storyline....it later is put more together (in relation to each other) as the story progresses. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment  (10 out of 10):<br />
<br />
If you like stories with well-developed romance, not too intense political intrigue, interesting character interplay, and amusing philosophical one-liners, then you will like Hanasakeru Seishounen. I thought this show was pretty addictive and great for more mature audiences who can appreciate the idiosyncrasies of the characters.<br />
<br />
Overall (10 out of 10):<br />
JUST TRY IT!! XD <br />

    -STORY- 10/10<br />
<br />
&quot;I love the happiness and the suffering. Because the only emotions I feel... are the ones you grant me.&quot;<br />
<br />
At first, Hanasakeru Seishounen appears to be a rather typical reverse harem story. Young girl surrounded by several beautiful men, nothing new for the given genre. But don&#039;t let this throw you off. Soon enough, our protagonists, along with the three marriage candidates, get involved in a complicated political conspiracy of a small Middle Eastern country. They face great dangers as they travel across the world, learn to trust and support each other, discover new emotions within themselves, and mature in order to survive and reach

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25550">
        their goals. <br />
<br />
The story was nicely paced and very intriguing, with numerous plot twists -- I could not bring myself to stop watching it or to let any other anime interrupt it. I loved that although the story set off with romance in mind, it was not the main focus. I will even say that if the whole husband-choosing piece was not present, this anime would still be just as good.<br />
At the end of the series, there was a certain sense of completeness, all questions were answered, all characters found their place in the world; it was a perfect spot to drop the curtain. I did feel a little sad, however, that such a great series came to a finale.<br />
<br />
-CHARACTERS- 10/10<br />
<br />
Kajika is not your typical damsel in distress constantly being saved by her male harem. She is strong and confident, is able to stand up for herself and to speak her mind when she has to. She is, however, rather slow when it comes to love and realizing her own feelings; but that is also understandable, considering that she grew up away from society and did not get a chance to experience romance until the husband game began. But even despite that, she treats each man with equal respect and consideration, which is very admirable. <br />
<br />
To me, however, the most interesting characters are the men surrounding Kajika. Needless to say that they are also not your typical male stereotypes found in a reverse harem. What grabbed me the most is how each one of potential candidates represented a different kind of love. Li Ren&#039;s love is strong and deep, to the point of becoming possessive of Kajika, yet his pride as a head of his clan stops him from being honest. Eugene&#039;s love is noble and selfless; he is willing to spend an eternity just watching over Kajika, whether she chooses him or not. Lumati, a young heir of Raginei, is blunt and straightforward about his love, but is also ready to admit defeat if his rival is worthy. And lastly, Carl is rather reserved and indecisive, but is equally sincere with his love and respectful toward his rivals. I really loved that these characters are not at each other&#039;s throats all the time, despite &quot;fighting&quot; against each other and feeling jealous, and instead act like mature adults and take both Kajika and each other seriously. Li Ren and Eugene may be an exception to that, but I don&#039;t believe they were ever serious during their quarrels.<br />
<br />
One character whose purpose I am still not sure about is Yui, Kajika&#039;s first female friend. She does not seem to do anything aside from exchanging letters with Kajika and fangirling over the male cast. She definitely belongs in a more typical shoujo setting, but thankfully her occurance was not frequent enough to cause a distraction. <br />
<br />
-ART/ANIMATION- 8/10<br />
<br />
Somewhere around episode 10 I found out that starting from episode 24 the series will have a different director. I was not worried about that. In fact, I was sure the series would become even better, considering that the second director is more experienced with shoujo anime and is famous for series like Fushigi Yuugi and Ayashi no Ceres. But unfortunately, as I later discovered, that change was not the best idea. It was obvious how the series became more &quot;shoujo&quot;, with more diverse and less realistic facial expressions, and a couple super-deformed scenes here and there. However, Hanasakeru Seishounen is a dramatic story that had no need for comedy elements; if anything, they were a distraction. Kajika, who was now blushing and showing her &quot;girly&quot; side more often, almost started to look like a typical shoujo heroine. Semi-chibi elements seemed completely out of place in such a serious setting. The character designs also went through a slight change, and although it was not major, some general inaccuracies emerged; for example, Kajika described Eugene&#039;s eye color as &quot;topaz&quot; in the beginning, but with the direction change, his eyes became a mix of light green and yellow instead of a golden brown from the first twenty-three episodes. <br />
<br />
The animation quality itself seemed to have improved in the second half and toward the end, and the opening animation also became more appealing, but I would still prefer that it did not undergo such a drastic change in the middle. Also, all the CG vehicles stood out too much and were a pain to look at; especially considering that cars, planes, and helicopters appeared on the screen very often because the characters moved around a lot between cities and countries.<br />
<br />
-SOUND- 6/10<br />
<br />
The background music was pretty good; it did not really grab my attention though, so there isn&#039;t much to discuss. I was not too impressed by the opening and ending songs either -- they were too &quot;pop&quot; for my tastes.

    It&#039;s definitely one of the underrated animes out there.<br />
<br />
Not your average reverse harem. Kajika, the main character is a strong heroine and you can&#039;t help but love her. Also, the characteristics of the guys surrounding her are very intimidating but you will come to love their uniqueness. Although it does not have the comedic ingredient that i usually go for, it&#039;s very heartwarming.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a 9/10 for me!

    I typically have a four episode rule when I watch an anime: After four consecutive episodes, if it has descended to such depths of frustrations and stupidity as to make watching it painful for me, I stop. <br />
<br />
This series failed my four episode test on the first four episodes.<br />
<br />
The Pros: The art style is nothing original, and several other bishonen series have very similar styles. The quality is not terribly bad, with the possible exception of the very first scene in the very first episode, where child kajika&#039;s head is disproportionately large. The characters are well voice acted, even if the rest of the sound

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14760">
        is absolutely run of the mill. The characterization is actually well done, for the most part, and is the most successful aspect of the anime, in my opinion. I find myself able to empathize with Li-ren and Barnesworth, and even Kajika, though her stubbornness is based squarely in stupidity and naivety, and her inability to consider the consequences of her actions is incredibly frustrating.<br />
<br />
The Cons: As I mentioned at the end of the Pros, Kajika is frustratingly stupid, and the series world just goes along with it, trying to portray her idiocy and self centered naivety as heroic behavior. <br />
<br />
The plot starts off alright, and has great possibility, but quickly descends into absurdity, with a nonsensical dilemma based on a convoluted family history. This is made worse by kajika&#039;s part in it, which seems to be limited to A) her insistence that Eugene is her dead pet cat because their (Eugene&#039;s and the cat&#039;s) eyes look the same, and B) her shooting a gun at a mirror, which manages to cause Eugene to spontaneously abandon his planned suicide and change his worldview entirely. <br />
<br />
I guess all the people at the suicide hot line need to do is have someone on hand to drive out and shoot a mirror, and that will instantly cause the suicider to abandon their self destructive course and see the world differently. Sounds like a plan; let me go tell them.<br />
<br />
In addition to this, the series is thematically barren, and consistently seems to shout that good looking people are somehow worth more than average looking people, and that it&#039;s okay to drive people to suicide as long as you&#039;re a selfish noble with a &#039;dark&#039; past. Personally, I blame the schools.<br />
<br />
Bottom Line: Well, this is what I have to say to you, creaters of this anime: As one of those average looking people, I object, and rate your crappy anime a 3 overall, based on it&#039;s crappy, poorly constructed plot, frustratingly idiotic main character (that everyone pretends is saintly), and inability to say anything worthwhile. So, no need to make any more, you should all just go die. <br />
<br />
Now, you might think that harsh, but if I was a silver haired, greened eyed pretty boy, you&#039;d want to have my babies, wouldn&#039;t you?<br />
<br />
Caveat: I may be a little harsh, as I&#039;m writing this write after finished episode four and the frustration and annoyance is still fresh, but it&#039;s a good estimation of how you will likely feel too. Unless, that is, you are a reincarnated cat.<br />
<br />
Update: I&#039;d like to apologize to all those who read this before now. It took me a while to come back and proof read, but I did. I&#039;m fairly certain I discovered all the offending passages and corrected them. Please enjoy.

    Based on the 10 episodes that have aired so far, at first, the show might seem silly, and the story very average. The first few episodes were really not awe-inspiring at all. However, since the introduction of the character, Lumati, his storyline has breathed new life into this show. <br />
<br />
I just recently started watching anime, so I am no authority. But, I really like the story that has cropped up since episode 5. Let&#039;s hope they keep up the good work!<br />

    This is my 1st anime review, so sorry if it&#039;s not that well-stated.  Also, sorry if it&#039;s too long (it&#039;s hard to NOT type more when there are so much in this series). Feel free to just skim through it, and maybe skip to the &quot;OVERALL&quot; part if you don&#039;t want much details. <br />
<br />
STORY-  8<br />
The story is rather interesting + unique to me. The thought of a &quot;marriage game&quot; may seem kinda cheezy, but the story goes WAY more deeper than that. For a reverse harem, it actually satisfies me somewhat. It has romance, drama, mysteries, political strategies, action (Oh. NOT hardcore stuff,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23471">
        like fighting ghosts and whatnot, but just fighting + guns, basically), and hey.... eventually, you might even find the tiniest bit of comedy towards the end (they are more like &quot;inside&quot;-kind of jokes, though, because you literally have to watch through the series, and know the characters to be able to understand the very little humor in this). <br />
<br />
ART-  7<br />
The art is standard to me, and sometimes, I have noticed that the characters appear kinda &quot;stiff.&quot; Not the typical sparkly-pretty. The artwork looks rather old-fashioned, and frankly, I didn&#039;t like it very must at first.  Of course, I can&#039;t blame it because the manga was actually published somewhere in the late 1980&#039;s (which I just recently looked it up online). Why would they have an anime broadcast all of a sudden?  Beats me. ----The thing that stands out to me are the EYES.  It&#039;s like the moods are pretty much portrayed in them.  The backgrounds are also very nice with a &quot;classic&quot;- feel to it. And.... Oh. Yes. THERE ARE BISHOUNENS.   :D<br />
<br />
SOUND-  7<br />
I think the voice actors/actresses have done their jobs well.  I could feel the strength in their voice during those serious, dramatic moments. (NOTE: There are only 1 op + ed  songs through-out the ENTIRE series) The opening is.... well~ nice, and I think what has won me over is the ending theme.  Although, maybe it&#039;s just because I&#039;m easily taken by those kind of sappy songs.  <br />
<br />
CHARACTER-  9<br />
This is the high-point of the series for me.  The characters are absolutely BEAUTIFULLY portrayed, especially the main ones.  Their backgrounds, and how they interact with each other really bring out the GOOD-NESS in their personalities.  They have.... ONE WORD:  depth.  Kajika is strong-willed, brave, reckless, and inexperience, but what I find weird is how.... understanding she could be at times. She&#039;s unique in that way. (I will not be going over all of the boys&#039; personalities, but I do suggest of you to find that out yourself ) At first, some characters are rather dull, but I think it just takes time for them to come through.  ~I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll love all of them (or most). They are likable. <br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT-  9<br />
I really enjoyed watching this 39 episodes- series. It have put me like at the edge of my seat more times than I can remember!! They sure do know how to build-up suspense. I, literally, looked forward to watching this every week (maybe above all of the other on-going anime). The length of it was not too short where it made you crave for more, nor was it too long and dragged out everything.  I may be just a sucker for reverse harems and shoujo with romance.. and bishounens and whatnot, but everything put together in this anime was what made it memorable for me.<br />
<br />
OVERALL-  9<br />
I&#039;ll say it flat-out:  HANASAKERU SEISHOUNEN is a wonderful series. It&#039;s original in pretty much every aspects, and inspirational/sweet. It may even be one of my favorite. However, I do (regretingly) not recommend it if you don&#039;t like mysteries, romance, serious drama, etc.. Well~ Even for someone like me, who knows like nothing about political stuff, I find it to be extremely entertaining. Just give it some time, and I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll like it.  <br />
<br />
----NOTE:  I may have overrated this just the tiniest bit because it&#039;s still fresh in my memories.  Thank you for reading.  ^^  I hope this helps, even if a little.

    Story: It starts out rather bland and boring but as the show goes on, it becomes a bit more interesting. There are some nice plot twists along the way but it&#039;s not all that surprising if you put your mind to it. Also, this is not really an &quot;interesting&quot; plotline but as far as these type of animes go, it&#039;s alright. <br />
<br />
Art: Nothing really special here, it&#039;s average.<br />
<br />
Sound: Also nothing special.<br />
<br />
Character: When I first started watching the show, Kajika seemed annoying and unrealistic, but it might be because of her living on a remote island for most of her life. The only other thing I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review18972">
        dislike about Kajika is that her foolish and naive acts are regarded as heroic ones. The other characters, like Li-ren, Ramty, Eugene, etc., are alright but seem rather bland and majorly cliched, some having the &quot;dark past&quot; scenario and such.<br />
<br />
Another thing that disturbs me about this show is about appearances. So you&#039;re beautiful and have a &quot;rare&quot; eye color, does that mean you&#039;re better than everyone else? That&#039;s how the show puts it, e.g. because Eugene has a dark past and is beautiful, so to speak, he&#039;s allowed to kill innocent people without having to deal with consequences (saying that he didn&#039;t kill them, he gave them a choice but they chose themselves to die instead of him), but instead it makes his soul &quot;more beautiful&quot;.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I must say that I *did* enjoy it even if I dislike many things about this show, realism for example, I mean really, how could you stop a suicidal man from jumping out of a window by just shooting his reflection on a mirror? Sure, it sounds very nice and poetic-like but it&#039;s not very real at all. I will watch the rest of the episodes but I don&#039;t think my opinion will change much.<br />
<br />
Overall: It&#039;s an overall good show, nothing to call the best or the worst show ever. It&#039;s an average show, more or less.

    I haven&#039;t seen a Shoujo for such a long time now because repeating the same loop of cliches can become boring the more you encounter it. Hanasakeru Seishounen is a Shoujo that has the same aspects every Shoujo has and you probably know what I&#039;m talking about. However, it does give you the sense of uniquity to it like Akatsuki No Yona though not as great. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m always a fan of romance. I don&#039;t know why I love romance, probably because I&#039;m still heartbroken? I don&#039;t really know. Anyways. I find romance to be one intriguing genre that will never get me bored. To be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review322652">
        honest, it&#039;s everywhere. 99.9% of the anime I watched probably have romance. <br />
<br />
Alright, I&#039;m just gonna cut the chase now because I don&#039;t really know what to write in this review.  Eto.. Ano.. Ah.. Hanasakeru Seishounen is one of those hidden Shoujo series that is actually very good. It took the meaning of Shoujo to another level, exploiting all the factors and providing the utmost of entertainment. <br />
<br />
This show seems underrated because it&#039;s such a masterpiece. Although I&#039;ve postponed this anime for such a long time, it&#039;s great to get the feeling of Shoujo from an anime again. <br />

    &gt;The anime that proves reverse harems can be more than just romance &lt;<br />
<br />
I’ll start this by stating that I am aware that Hanasakeru Seishonen is ultimately a “romance anime”, however it doesn’t stop it from having quite a few interesting sub-genres that just don’t usually happen to turn into the focus of the story for a very long time like it did in this anime.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
 <br />
Most synopses for Hanasakeru Seishonen can never actually prepare you for what the story is actually about, and, sincerely, I think that it’s better without being aware. I dived in, believing that it was a “game of match-making” between rich

          <span style="display: none;" id="review216033">
        people: one girl and 4 candidates. Who will impress her more? Sounded pretty average, a setting that I’ve already seen many times before in k-drama, but that it can always become quite enjoyable if kept to its utmost simplicity… Well, I must take that back.<br />
<br />
Hanasakeru Seishonen does a reverse harem how a reverse harem should be, which is not limited to simply “main girl falls in love with lots of cute bishies”, but expands its world with a good share of character development and topics. By half of the show, I was questioning whether it was going to keep being a romance-focused anime…Which it partly, didn’t. And I praise that to no end.<br />
<br />
The story is  very progressive and while it did have some moments that simply apply the famous “anime reverse harem logic” to them, I never really felt like condemning it. Not always at least. One of the moments when I did feel like rolling my eyes, if I had to mention one of them, would be when the characters had an unjustified “feeling” that something is going to go in a certain way, despite them not having a reason to have those sorts of thoughts. It was also implied that a person can feel strongly for something if it’s in their blood to care for that something, which is just a romantic view and not even by far rational.<br />
<br />
<br />
I must say that, at one point, I really felt like the story resembled a Korean drama, which for me, is not exactly the best. Don’t take me wrong, I have nothing against them, nor do I dislike them in any way; it’s just that most of my past experiences with them has scarred my expectations of the genre sometimes (If there are any Korean drama fans reading this, I am aware that not everything is bad and I’m not trying to do a hefty generalization).  What do I mean by that? It tended to be overly-dramatical and overly-angsty, but sometimes it was for good reason. Some other times, mostly during the end of it, it felt like it was just there for the characters to feel miserable for a while, only to move on right after, and I couldn’t really feel anything but annoyed at them in those moments.<br />
<br />
The ending was also kind of anticlimactic for me, seeing how I really grew tired of that particular trope (which I’ll obviously not mention) and it was a kind of innocent “Love always wins”, which I don’t dislike, but as a generally unromantic person, I hardly fall for that, at least executed the way that it was in Hanasakeru Seishonen. Maybe if it were a bit less obvious, I would have enjoyed it more. I really felt like some of the heroine’s values really contrasted with the rest of the story (which I think was sometimes on purpose) and because of that contrast, I didn’t feel that “Love always wins” would work so well in such a straightforwardly executed way.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
 <br />
<br />
It’s hard to not start with the heroine at this point. She’s definitely not what I’m used to when we speak of reverse harems. Kajika manages to maintain her innocence and sometimes naivety, but she doesn’t let that drag her down. Because she’s naïve, it doesn’t mean that she’s stupid and I’m very glad that the author managed to differentiate the two things. She uses her good natured personality in order to help those in need and her confidence in being able to help actually helped not only others, but even herself towards her personal growth as a person. She also has a very unique belief in life and even if it was weird for the people around her, she never gave up in believing what she wanted to believe is right. But…she starts of the story as a 14 years old.<br />
<br />
 I really can’t understand how a 14 years old girl can act like such a grown-up. Not that it’s impossible, but it’s hard for other people older than her to take her as seriously as they would take somebody their age. This included the guys, which, with the exception of Rumaty, are all over 20 years of age.<br />
<br />
About the guys, let’s face it. They start off like the most generic archetypes: the childhood friend, the flirty guy, the rebellious shota, the gay-…Wait, what?<br />
<br />
They definitely can’t just be defined by one word.<br />
<br />
Fang Li Ren (or Hwang Lee-Leng?…I kept questioning the subs since that name sounds more Korean than it does Chinese so I am sticking with Fang Li Ren) the charismatic childhood friend that can in no way allow himself to be selfish.<br />
<br />
Eugene de Volkan, a gorgeous-looking playboy that has lost trust in the people around him, yet his reasons go a bit more serious than just the “they use me because I’m handsome” trope.<br />
<br />
Rumaty Ivan di Raginei, an open-minded prince that is forced to grow up in order to become a king.<br />
<br />
And lastly, Carl Rosenthal, son of a revenge-driven businessman, who tries to find his own identity and place in the world.<br />
<br />
It was a nice surprise to see such a diverse cast in this anime and I genuinely can claim that I didn’t care as much for a story and its characters like I did in this case, in a very long time (excepting Noragami, but I’m not counting it, seeing how it’s a second season and a series that already established its place in my heart a long time ago).<br />
<br />
Animation&amp;OST<br />
<br />
Overall typical, but animation doesn’t completely make the story, it just adds to it, and in this case, it did add quite well.<br />
<br />
OST though, I must recognize that I spammed the opening and ending for this anime continuously from when i started the anime a few months ago to today. They are both sung by k-pop singer, J-Min and she really did a great job at performing.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
<br />
I really recommend this to all otome game/reverse harem stories lovers. Even if the first episodes might be weird or slow for you, just give it a try and you won’t regret it.

    So far, judging from all the episodes aired, I&#039;m really enjoying this series.<br />
<br />
Story: The story, especially in the most recent arc, is really enjoyable. Few plot twists, cute lines etc. It&#039;s not like OMG AWESOME but it is good none-the-less. <br />
<br />
Art: I like the character designs. Lots of bishies...<br />
<br />
Sound: I haven&#039;t paid much attention to the BGM, which probably says something in itself. I do like the opening song though. Engrish galore!<br />
<br />
Character: The characters are not the stereotypical bishies you tend to get in Reverse Harems. They do have different personlities, and their interactions with the lead girl is always more than just &#039;I love

          <span style="display: none;" id="review16312">
        you, marry me&#039;. The characters have a certain amount of depth.<br />
<br />
Ok, the lead girl is slightly too perfect, a mistake plenty of shoujos make. But how many shounen heroes can you think of who have that annoying, whiney justice complex?<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Yeah, boys and lesbians wouldn&#039;t really enjoy this series much. But if you&#039;re into bishies and interesting storyline then this is not a show to pass. <br />
<br />
Overall: This show IS a kind of guilty pleasure of mine, and I do find myself looking forward to the next episode every week. It&#039;s definitely entertaining! Based on what I&#039;ve seen, I&#039;ve given this series a 9.

    I&#039;m not usually bothered about writing reviews, but I have never been so moved by an anime before, that I felt compelled to encourage other people to watch it.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
There were always lots of twists and turns in the story line, which I wouldn&#039;t have expected. It was a really interesting plot which I really enjoyed. The romance was great and I couldn&#039;t stop watching! The atmosphere of each episode was very mature, and usually beautiful (apart from the action scenes). I didn&#039;t like the heavy politics, which is my only complaint.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
I think that type of art in anime is for the &#039;beautiful boys&#039;. It makes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review42811">
        the women look less cute, but more beautiful and mature. I wasn&#039;t used to it at first and didn&#039;t like it, but I found myself growing to like it more and more with each episode. It certainly suited the male characters, they all looked so mature and handsome, which is never really a bad thing when you&#039;re a teenage girl.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
I loved the music, which is surprising as I&#039;m not usually one for the music in anime. With each mood there was a perfect song to match the atmosphere, which made the overall enjoyment of the romance/action scenes even better. The music was mature and beautiful, and it fitted perfectly with the story line.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
I loved the fact that each of the characters grew older and developed new personality traits towards the end of the anime, even small things like the length of their hair, and their height. It made the anime seem more realistic. Each character has their own story and unique personality, and each one of them interested and fascinated me (especially Eugene/Mustafa). At times the men could seem a little bit dramatic, but I think that made them seem more realistic and relatable. Kajika was a female lead unlike any other, she was mature and passionate, and she never once annoyed me like most female anime leads do. They&#039;re the most interesting characters I have ever seen in an anime, each of them very admirable and beautiful in their own way.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I really enjoyed most episodes, but there were the odd episode or two were I was desperate to fast forward through to ignore all the political talks. I&#039;m not really interested in politics, but I did at times enjoy the talks. That&#039;s really the only bad thing I can think of which would mark my rating down from a 10 to a 9. It&#039;s quite hard for me to cram all that information about the different places, people and conspiracies, but when you do understand and take it all in, it becomes very interesting. I think  Hanasakeru Seishounen is probably one of those animes which you need to watch twice to fully appreciate. The romance was great for me, especially the romantic gestures and the beautiful words exchanged between the four men and Kajika. It really moved me when they would talk about finding love, it inspired me too. The whole series is really mature and enjoyable, I&#039;ve never watched an anime like it before. The best part for me was the fact that it had a good amount of action, which would always leave my heart racing.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t be put off if you think it sounds too mature, I&#039;m usually into the cute, happy anime which isn&#039;t hard to follow, so this was a different direction for me. Everyone should watch this, it&#039;s so beautiful. I think boys would appreciate this anime too, despite the heavy romance. I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I did :)

    Don&#039;t let the reverse harem concept and all the bishonen put you off.  Once it takes off, this show is smart and entertaining.  I&#039;m up to episode 23 and loving it.  It starts off on the flimsy premise of an ultra wealthy father presenting his naive teenage daughter with a slate of potential husband candidates but, for me, about half way through, that became incidental to the relatively accurate portrayal of the machinations of global mega corporations, religion, international policy, and corrupt politics.  If you are the least bit aware of current events, it is clear that the names and places

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19566">
        have been changed to protect the guilty.  Even if you aren&#039;t interested in the deeper aspects of the story, I&#039;m sure you will be engaged by the international intrigue, action, adventure, and jet set romance.  And the pretty boys.  Lots of pretty boys.

    DURING the first 3 episodes, i&#039;m not that satisfied to this anime to the point i would&#039;ve give it a flat 4.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, i reconsidered it when i decided &amp; finished watching the other 7 episodes...so far, it starts to make me interested unto the story and its overall quality.<br />
<br />
FURTHERMORE it made me begin &quot;to have a hope that as the story progress it would not degenerate unto a worse anime&quot;, according from what it have shown me so far.<br />
<br />
LASTLY, i hope the studio would finished the &quot;39&quot; episodes of this anime...XD

    As an opening statement, I would like to declare that reverse harem has become one of my least favorite genres over my many years of experience watching anime. With my growing age and less tolerance for bad anime, I&#039;d recently given up on even trying to watch any type of reverse harem for the sole reason of saving my time for better things. Despite this, something was compelling me to give Hanasakeru Seishounen, and anime that had been sitting in my PTW for years, a chance. Was it the good rating? The good reviews? The fact that I wanted to watch a romance after seeing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345689">
        so much action/thriller anime? Who knows. But once I started watching Hanasakeru Seishounen, my god, I could not stop.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story | 10/10<br />
The main plotline of Hanasakeru Seishonen tells the story of Kajika Burnsworth, the daughter of a very well-respected and wealthy man, who is told by her father that she will be participating in a husband-hunting game. During this game, Kajika must find and get to know three men that her father randomly appointed as potential husbands, then choose one to marry. I actually really liked the uniqueness of this idea! It&#039;s very different from other reverse harem regarding the fact that the female MC is the one who approaches the love interests rather than the other way around. Moreover, she doesn&#039;t meet the three men in only a single episode, but gradually over time, meaning that Kajika gets to spend a good bit of one-on-one time with each love interest before the next one is introduced. This allows time for a natural bond to be formed between Kajika and the men, and because of the kindness Kajika shows to them, she becomes an important person in each of their lives. It didn&#039;t feel like any of these relationships were forced or poorly paced at all, so when it came time for these men to start realizing that they loved Kajika, I thought it to be perfectly timed out. <br />
<br />
Before going too deep into the anime, I was a bit concerned on how the story would stretch over a 39-episode time frame considering Kajika had already met two of the three potential husbands by the 10th episode. I was initially worried that the plot would end up revolving around a jealous battle between the men to see who could get Kajika to fall in love with them first, since that&#039;s usually what reverse harem turn into once all the love interests are introduced. However, my assumptions about the direction of the story were instantly nullified once something stepped in that made me adore the story even more: the subplot. <br />
<br />
The problem that seems to plague most reverse harem is that the romantic focus of the MC&#039;s relationship with the love interests almost always overpowers the focus of the plot that the anime tries to go for. Hanasakeru Seishounen is very different from this. It has a subplot that revolves around the kingdom of Raginei, which runs for almost the entirety of the second half of the anime. This part of the anime adds in politics, drama, danger, and suspense alongside the romantic aspect, which forms the purpose of the story into something more than just a husband-hunting game. It shifts the anime&#039;s focus from finding love to helping friends, and I feel like these friendship elements have always been crucial to the anime due to Kajika&#039;s supportive and empathetic personality. Not a single time did I feel like this subplot was irrelevant to the main plot, because even though Kajika becomes involved with bigger events, the fact that she has to choose someone to marry is never forgotten. <br />
<br />
Once all conflict dies down and it&#039;s time for the story to near its end, Kajika finally makes her decision on who she wants to marry. This isn&#039;t an anime where the choice is left up to speculation, or even one where Kajika decides that she doesn&#039;t want to marry at all. The fact that she follows through with what she was instructed to do in the very first episode brings satisfying closure to the story, and as someone who had been eagerly awaiting for the results of this decision since the beginning, I was overjoyed when I saw that the person of her choosing was exactly who I wanted it to be! <br />
<br />
<br />
Character | 10/10<br />
Character depth and development is an attribute that consistently remains strong and well-paced during the entirety of the anime. Hanasakeru Seishounen takes place over a 3 year period, so as the characters grow older, the development works perfectly in transforming them into more mature and well-mannered people over time. Along with that, all five of the main characters were each given very respectable personalities that I quickly fell in love with. <br />
<br />
Kajika is a phenomenal female lead. She&#039;s strong, assertive, and willing to do whatever she can to help those in need. The most attractive part of her personality is her kindness to everyone, even to those who weren&#039;t particularly fond of her, and her ability to forgive those who wronged her. Kajika is a genuine role model character who wishes happiness for all, and who will tackle conflict head on to find a solution. Her independent problem-solving skills were probably some of the best I had ever seen come from a female main character in a reverse harem story, and for that Kajika has become one of my absolute favorite strong female leads. It was so fun watching her character in action.  <br />
<br />
I won&#039;t cover all the men specifically - them being Eugene, Rumaty, Carl, and Li Ren - but I want to cover them as a group. Throughout the anime, all of these men fall deeply in love with Kajika. For them, the kindness Kajika has shown to them has shaped them into the people they are by the end of the anime, so she&#039;s a very valued and important person to them. Despite their love for her, and their wishes for her to feel the same way toward them, not a single one of them EVER try to force themselves on her. This!! This is a HUGE thing for me! Though it is so obvious these men want so badly to embrace Kajika, they don&#039;t because they respect her boundaries and don&#039;t want to put her in an awkward or uncomfortable situation. Not only that, but they also don&#039;t wine, complain, or even try to give her reasons why she should choose them instead when Kajika finally decides on who she wants to marry. Hell, the guys she ended up turning down even HELP her reunite with the one she chose when a problem had them separated. Though Kajika&#039;s feelings for them were only platonic, they didn&#039;t let their love for her stop her from being with the person that SHE loved. That&#039;s respect, and I loved this part of these men!<br />
<br />
<br />
Art | 9/10<br />
I truly can&#039;t deny the fact that I love me some bishounens! The style of this anime DEFINITELY caters toward a female demographic with its abundance of pretty boys, but honestly I expected no less. Romance stories are told best when the characters are attractive, in my opinion, and Hanasakeru Seishounen excelled in presenting a beautiful cast of both male and female characters (Li Ren especially, lol). <br />
<br />
In all seriousness though, I try not to judge an anime based on its art, but when the art and animation are attractive, that&#039;s definitely a plus. Complimenting the gorgeous art style is animation that is without mistakes and smooth. The animators also did a great job making younger characters like Kajika and Rumaty appear older after the one year time jump as well as keeping this slight change consistent throughout the rest of the anime. <br />
<br />
One thing that put me off though - and it&#039;s more hilarious to me than anything - was that you could tell the difference between a main/heavy supporting character and a mere background character just by the shape of their noses. The main characters had pointed noses, which is a feature that somewhat adds to the attractiveness of an anime character, while the background characters had round noses, thus making them less attractive. There&#039;s nothing more to it than that, I just thought it was a funny little detail. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound | 9/10<br />
Despite being an anime with 39 episodes, Hanasakeru Seishounen only features one opening and ending theme, both of which I found to be super cute, catchy, and hard to skip. If the previous episode had ended on a cliffhanger that left me impatient regarding what was to come, I may have been guilty of fast-forwarding through the themes. On the other hand, if I wasn&#039;t totally dying to know where the story would go, I happily let the themes play all the way through. <br />
<br />
Instrumental soundtracks in anime usually aren&#039;t memorable for me. However, I can definitely say that the music within this anime did an amazing job capturing the mood of each scene. Whenever the emotions of a character changed, there was an orchestra right behind it, enhancing those feelings so they could reach the watcher. This made the atmosphere of character emotions feel more realistic to me, which created a watching experience that was all the more entertaining.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment | 10/10<br />
I&#039;m so happy that I caved in to the urges and decided to give this anime a chance! Unlike most other reverse harem I&#039;ve seen, Hanasakeru Seishounen delivered a beautiful and charming start-to-finish story that I absolutely adored. There was never a dull moment in the plotline, which constantly gave me a desperate feeling of eagerness to find out what would happen next, and I fell in love with each and every character. The ending was also extremely satisfying and was a great closing to a remarkable story. Nothing about what was delivered made me sense that things could be improved if something else was done. Overall, Hanasakeru Seishounen left a very warm place in my heart. I truly wish other reverse harem were as ambitious as this one. <br />

    NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, ok this anime is underrated in the description and the profile picture on MAL for this show is deceiving. Yes those are the man characters but the story is so much more. It starts with a game that leads to a realization of love, sounds simple enough right? Wrong, the story is really something special, like most its a fictional story and must be taken that way so as long as your not a picking it over with a fine tooth comb and trying to find flaws you&#039;ll enjoy it if this genre is one you like.  The show does

          <span style="display: none;" id="review75619">
        start out slow and I must say I had to press on through the first 5 or 6. But once you know who&#039;s who the story picks up tempo. This is a more mature audiences (not because of adult content but because it is deeper and more refined than your usual happy go lucky anime) romance/minor drama/minor action/minor political. Except the drama doesn&#039;t make you want to scream and the political isn&#039;t a bore to pay attention too, and the action gets the point across and is more realistic and not stupid. I didn&#039;t expect what I got and I was very pleased with what I received in the end.<br />
<br />
Outline of story: (no spoilers other than outline of events so stop here if don&#039;t want to see what&#039;s coming)<br />
This story begins with a young woman named Kajika Burnsworth. Now if you read the description of the show it will tell you a very small yet crucial aspect. Yes kajika is playing a game of sorts to find a husband, but the story in the story is where this anime becomes great. She meets these 3 different men and changes each of their lives, sounds like an anime theme done to death right, well as it progresses this becomes an issue of a nation and its involves several of the worlds largest corporations in its problems all leading back to oil distribution and a secret past that started it all. The Royalty of this nation changes hands and its is now a race to right the wrongs and bring back balance. Yes this is a vague overview but why should I spoil it for you, go watch it.

    Story: 6/10<br />
<br />
All things told, the story was okay. It was an interesting story and the plot was the main reason I persisted in watching this to the end. It starts out as the typical reverse harem plot, but ends up branching into so much more, which works in this anime&#039;s favour because it has little else going for it.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Sound: 5/10<br />
<br />
It was average. It didn&#039;t wow me, but it didn&#039;t necessarily disappoint either.<br />
<br />
Character: 4/10<br />
<br />
Man, where do I start? Let&#039;s start with the main character. At some point I started calling her Mary Sue because she&#039;s off her rocker and everyone around her just goes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review227834">
        with it because they&#039;re all in love with her. She&#039;s selfish, entitled, and has no concept of reality or common sense at all. She&#039;s literally the star of the show and everyone else is just an accessory to her 85% of the time. Most of the time I was thinking, &quot;You know this is anime because she&#039;s always getting her way and nobody does anything about it.&quot;<br />
Some of the characters were genuinely likeable, and it was every other character, through group effort, that dragged this score up from the ground. Their motivations were more believable and predictable to a degree, if not necessarily more human.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 4/10<br />
<br />
I hated this for the first like 15 episodes, but I was promised it would get better so I stuck with it. The plot was interesting enough to keep me going, but the characters, most notably the main one, just bogged everything down with what a special little snowflake she was.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4/10<br />
<br />
Would not watch again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    I don&#039;t normally write reviews but after looking over some of the ratings other lesser anime get, I guess I felt a little obligated to write about why this anime deserves more recognition. <br />
<br />
story: so the entire story line to this anime was brilliant and tied together very nicely unlike anime we so often see that has characters all shoved into one series with the sole purpose of having a reverse harem and nothing deeper. Every character in this had a purpose and the plot line left no plot holes or things left to be explained. Everything tied together nicely, and I loved that the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249788">
        main heroine defied the stereotypical norms of a female lead leaving out ALOT of frustration and agony along the way.<br />
<br />
characters: like I said, a brilliant cast. Every character had a story and a unique personality that more importantly, served a greater purpose. They were relatable characters and I liked that everyone of them had character depth and not just the main ones. the main girl in particular proved to be strong and unique shattering the annoying stereotype Japan typically places on the main female leads. <br />
<br />
art: the artwork is some of the best i&#039;ve seen in an anime which fully emphasizes the uniqueness of the entire series. <br />
<br />
music: the music was pretty lit too I will admit. Everything about this drama was perfect. <br />
<br />
I would definitely put this under the severely underrated drama category. I don&#039;t even remember how I stumbled across this gem but I&#039;m very glad I did. Definitely one of the best anime I&#039;ve seen in my anime watching career.

    Story:<br />
<br />
The theme of this anime is scattered in all directions and in a negative sense.<br />
The plot is a young rich girls that must choose the future groom.<br />
Of course this leads to complications because you don&#039;t know who is more beautiful.<br />
Do not forget male characters are cool, tall and terribly handsome.<br />
To give this topic a 4.<br />
<br />
ART:<br />
<br />
Drawing I like it, nicely made and recommends that if download anime definitely download it in HQ.<br />
I give for art 7.<br />
<br />
Sound.<br />
<br />
OST is the average. 5<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
Are detailed, have a sense of past, present and future. The only thing that I like in anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
huhu<br />
<br />
For me, certainly not fun, because I stopped download anime.<br />
I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review18024">
        saw all kinds of genres of anime and this is certainly not something new or something special.<br />
<br />
If you are experienced in the anime, do not spend time on it. And for young girls that is just entering in the world of anime, this anime will be for you.<br />
This anime is girly!

    We all have our guilty pleasure. Mine is romance, the cheesier the better (shhhhhh, don&#039;t look at me!) However, reverse harems have never been a big favorite of mine. My main issue with them is that they make the lead female as dull as a dried up dog turd. I understand why they do this; they want her to be a blank slate so that the viewers can easily see themselves as her (think Bella from Twilight). The lead in the anime actually had a personality! That is what convinced me to watch past the first episode, and i&#039;m glad I did.<br />
<br />
The lead character really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review172565">
        brings it all together for me, she is kind, and strong willed, and intelligent. Her fault might be she is too perfect and everyone falls for her but thats what to expect from reverse harem. I didn&#039;t mind too much because her personality made up for it. <br />
<br />
The male characters are also nice, there are 4 potential love interests and they are all unique. I was rooting for all them because they were all kind hearted guys, <br />
<br />
The story is the best i&#039;ve seen done in a reverse harem anime; there were moments I forgot I was even watching a reverse harem. There is lots of political power struggles and a nice twist (i&#039;m fooled a lot easier than other people so some might figure out the twist early on) The plot was great because it connected all the characters together. Each male suitor played an important role in bringing the meat of the story together, I thought it was really creative.<br />
<br />
The art and character design we very nice to look at. It wasn&#039;t awe inspiring animation, but it was still pretty to look at. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t really remember the soundtrack, so it wasn&#039;t that great but it didn&#039;t distract me from what was going on. <br />
<br />
Overall, if you like romance stories with good plots then i&#039;d give this one a try. I&#039;d say if you&#039;ve never seen a reverse harem before than this would be a good one to start with.

     When i first came across this anime i thought it would be just another romance, and that&#039;s why i watched it because i was in the mood for romance. <br />
 ~Story~<br />
 At the beginning, the anime stuck to the romance and developing the characters, if you weren&#039;t a romance fan the first ten or so episodes would seem just not action packed enough for your liking. After you meet all the suitors you actually leave the path of just a romance and head into the path of political, drama and of course action. There is still romance for the fan girls but not too

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34023">
        much to where it becomes just another fairy tale. The plot was actually very unique, at first it didn&#039;t seem so but it really is a very amazing plot. Towards the beginning of the story i think everyone was just expecting a normal romance anime with cute boys, naive girls and far too much fantasy but it became a very intresting and well thought out plot. It goes something like this. <br />
 The heir to the Burnsworth company, Kajika is asked by her father to play a game in which she will have to choose a husband out of three men whom will not know her and she will not know them. Her father sets up the meetings without telling her anything about the men, only giving her the hint that she will know when she finds them. As she slowly meets the three men and learns about their pasts and possible futures she is thrown into a political nightmare. A small country in the middle east is having problems with their royal family (cant give too much away) And kajika is mixed up in it. <br />
 ~Art~ <br />
 The art and graphics were amazing, one of the best i have seen in anime and im not just saying that so you want to watch it, i truly loved the art. Everything was clear and drawn so well it was like you were transported into a whole new world (Aladin LoL)<br />
~Sounds~<br />
 I don&#039;t know why but with a lot of anime they really only have three or four songs throughout the anime like for instance during mecha fight scenes you always hear the same music play, and honestly it gets repetitive and annoying. However that does not apply exactly, yes they don&#039;t have a wide variety of songs in this anime but unlike others they place them in a way that makes it so its not as repetitive and it actually doesn&#039;t annoy you which was a breath of fresh air. <br />
 ~Characters~<br />
 Usually the female rolls to me seem either rude,stupid, overly dramatic or too naive but for Kajika this doesn&#039;t seem to apply. She is innocent yes but not so innocent where you just want to slap some sense into her. She is also mature for as young as she is, she acts more mature than half the twenty year olds i know and shes only fourteen. Apparently they insinuate that she had to grow up fast due to her being isolated on an island after her mother was killed during a kidnap attempt (Not a spoiler they tell you that in the first or second episode it doesn&#039;t effect the story its just background) They don&#039;t really touch on the subject of why she had to grow up fast other than that but apparently she just did which is fine. <br />
 The three (Four) Possible matches for Kajika are all very different in both looks and personality. Theres one that&#039;s cold, one that is just terribly sad and lonely, a trouble making one and of course the business like and shy one. They all also are a breath of fresh air from the usual male leads because they aren&#039;t as shallow and undeveloped. I liked them a lot for different reasons.  <br />
 In the first episode and two more later on in the series you are introduced to a girl named Yuuie, shes not a main character and i don&#039;t know why im bringing her up. She is the only character that annoyed me and only for two reasons. One is because she had some serious lesbian thoughts about Kajika and that&#039;s not a bad thing but she takes it too far to when she doesn&#039;t get a letter very often she starts questioning their friendship blah blah. Its annoying honestly but you warm up to her eventually she grows on you.<br />
 All other characters are alright, they dont all need to be brought up. <br />
 ~Enjoyment~<br />
 Well i have watched this series more than ten times due to the fact that the enjoyment level is very high and ill tell you why! (Ha i rhymed) <br />
 The characters weren&#039;t annoying, the graphics were amazing and obviously took some time, the sound was good because it didn&#039;t repeat itself until you wanted to just turn your sound off and the story was amazing. <br />
 ~Overall/Recommend?~<br />
 Overall i think the anime is one of my favorites for the reasons stated above but also because not only was it good but it was also unique which you don&#039;t see a lot in a time where its all about sparkling vampires and werewolves or in anime&#039;s case harems and mechas.  <br />
 The biggest question is do i recommend it and to who. Well i recommend this greatly to EVERY type of anime lover because it has a little bit of everything for everyone. Of course there arent any giant robots crashing buildings or anything for the mecha fans but there are quite a lot of guns it that helps. Anyways i give it 10/10
